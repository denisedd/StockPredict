{"Headline": "A Coup, Terrorists and Inflation, Yet Investors Rush to Turkey", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn the face of it, this might not seem the right time to be investing in Turkey.Terrorists attacked the main airport in Istanbul, a foiled coup raised questions about political stability, and the country\u2019s debt is being downgraded by rating agencies \u2014 all of this happening within a span of two weeks.So what were the best-performing investments in the global economy last week?You guessed it: Turkish stocks and bonds \u2014 up 6.6 and 3.8 percent in dollar terms, according to Merrill Lynch.Emerging markets are known for their wild, discordant swings, but this mini-rally in Turkey, brief as it may be, highlights just how much risk yield-starved investors are willing to take on when $11 trillion worth of bonds of governments around the world are offering up negative returns.That is why a Turkish 10-year bond that offers a 9 percent reward can be tempting, even if that country\u2019s inflation rate is 8.7 percent and rising and its currency is heading south.Stocks and bonds in developing markets have been on a tear since early last year, with once-scorned countries like Brazil (stock market up 54 percent in dollar terms for the year) and South Africa (up 24 percent during the same period) leading the way.The surge has been driven in part by a shift in mood by investors choosing to scoop up beaten-down assets in these countries. Emerging-market stocks as a whole are trading at steep discounts to their counterparts in the United States and Europe.A partial recovery in oil prices, political calm in Brazil and a growing sense that Chinese authorities will not allow the renminbi to collapse have also had their effect.At the root of this sudden rush of money into high-risk assets is the pressure that many institutions, from large pension funds and insurance companies to some hedge funds, are facing to find returns in a world of zero to negative interest rates.These pressures have increased since the market shock of the British vote to leave Europe. Bonds yields have continued to shrink and stock markets have hit record highs, giving investors further pause about their overweight positions in developed market stocks and bonds.\u201cIn places like Europe, the U.K. and the U.S., you have lots of risks but no reward,\u201d said Gavin Serkin, an emerging-markets expert at Frontier Funds, a consulting firm based in London. \u201cIn the developing world, you have risks, but at least you are getting paid for it.\u201dAnd that even includes Mongolia, where a new government and a view that commodity markets have bottomed have prompted a stampede into Mongolian government bonds.Other unlikely markets that are now in demand include Russia, where stocks year to date are up over 20 percent in dollar terms. A big factor driving these rallies, traders say, is the sense the currencies of these countries that have suffered from a strong dollar in recent years are now in recovery mode.And while there is still potential for the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates, there is less fear than there was a year ago that rates will push persistently upward and lure money out of emerging economies.Investors are also finding bargains among established companies in emerging markets that have improved their profitability in recent years but still trade at 30 percent discounts to their developed-market peers.\u201cWe are seeing a real shift in sentiment,\u201d said Nick Robinson, a portfolio manager at Aberdeen Investment Management which oversees $420 billion, a large chunk of which is in developing markets. \u201cAnd you really don\u2019t have to look too hard to find good stories with cheap valuations.\u201dAccording to the Institute of International Finance, a bank lobby that tracks global capital flows, about $25 billion poured into emerging markets last month. Asia and Latin America absorbed most of these funds.Combined with the $13 billion that swept into these markets in June, the last two months reflect a sharp shift in sentiment after one of the worst periods ever for emerging-market capital flows.According to the institute\u2019s calculations, $81 billion exited these markets in the months after the Chinese devaluation scare last August \u2014 an amount that approached that $96 billion that fled during the financial crisis.Economists at Institute of International Finance say that the flows surged in the weeks after Britain\u2019s surprise vote to leave the European Union when investors doubled down on their safe-haven bets by buying Japanese, European and United States government bonds.As the yields on these securities vanished late last month, government bonds in Brazil, South Africa and Turkey that yielded around 10 percent began to look attractive.That was especially so when compared with Italy, where comparable securities offered a 1 percent return even with concerns mounting that the country\u2019s banking crisis might force it to leave the euro.Or Japan, where investors in July took the extraordinary step of paying to borrow money for 20 years from a government with the highest debt burden among developed nations.Such minuscule returns are the result of an unprecedented era of monetary policy activism. The world\u2019s central banks have bought up 15 percent of global corporate and sovereign bonds in an effort to stimulate economic recovery.But, as Jan Dehn, the head of research at Ashmore in London, which oversees $51 billion in emerging market assets, points out, these securities do not hail from emerging markets.And that is why, he says, there is such a contrast between bond yields in the developed as opposed to the developing world as investors worldwide have, for the most part, ignored emerging markets in favor of following in the path of central banks.\u201cThe Q.E. trade is over,\u201d said Mr. Dehn, referring to the central bank policy of quantitative easing. \u201cAnd people are now looking to the non-Q.E. world, where the bonds in countries representing 58 percent of G.D.P. had an average yield of 5.6 percent \u2014 which is higher than when the Fed had rates at 5 percent before the crisis. That is pretty extraordinary.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rousseff\u2019s Impeachment Changes the Government, Not the Politics", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBRAS\u00cdLIA \u2014 The last photograph of Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva as president of Brazil, taken on Jan. 1, 2011, shows him moving down the ramp of the Pal\u00e1cio do Planalto, like an idolized performer who dives into his audience at the end of a show, ignoring his security detail and drowning in a sea of his supporters\u2019 hands.Five and a half years later, Brazil\u2019s Senate has provisionally suspended President Dilma Rousseff from office; on Wednesday she will be fully removed from the presidency. In the midst of the crumbling of the Workers\u2019 Party, or P.T., Mr. da Silva went back to the Planalto Palace to support an embattled Ms. Rousseff. His eyes full of tears, he said to a friend, \u201cI did not want to be part of this picture.\u201dThe road from one image to the other has been tortuous. Ms. Rousseff presided over a steady economy for most of her first term, but miscalculated in relying on budget manipulation to sustain economic growth. Once she was re-elected, in 2014, the fiscal austerity measures that she presided over slowed an already stagnant economy. Ideological zigzagging gave ammunition to her opponents, and cost her a good number of followers who saw in her fiscal policy the neo-liberal agenda of the opposition.Meanwhile, the jewel of Brazilian state-owned companies, Petrobras, has been marred by a corruption case in which investigators have uncovered a network of endless graft and corruption in the public service; it has shaken the political class (there are already 364 politicians under investigation). Mr. da Silva\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party, founded under a banner of ethics, is once again at the center of a corruption scandal (the vote buying scandal Mensal\u00e3o, or \u201cbig allowance,\u201d was the first), and this time the P.T. is dangling like a pi\u00f1ata for everyone to take a swing at.The ousting of Ms. Rousseff and the P.T. meant that Vice President Michel Temer became acting president. Mr. Temer, the leader of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, or P.M.D.B., was the top ally of the sinking government until he turned against Ms. Rousseff to head the impeachment process. However, the P.M.D.B. is no less involved in the looting of Petrobras than the other parties. A sinking economy, and outrage against corruption, set off successive and intense popular rallies that led to a change in government, but not in Brazilian politics.Mr. Temer took over as acting president on May 12 with an all-white, all-male cabinet. The image resembles a restored picture of a seemingly distant Brazil, in sharp contrast with the diverse entourage that departed away with Ms. Rousseff, the country\u2019s first woman president.The new administration\u2019s neo-liberal projects include reforms to loosen workers\u2019 protection laws, the end of a fixed allotment of the government spending to public health and education and the fiscal tightening that Ms. Rousseff could not manage to carry through \u2014 in all, a picture in which the poorest already know very well who will be left out.Even if the storm hasn\u2019t completely passed, one can already see the politicians falling back into their old ways \u2014 like filling cabinet posts from among the governing coalition parties, many of which lack any clear ideology, in exchange for votes in Congress. There is not a hint of a political reform on the horizon.After the impeachment became irrevocable, extensive social unrest, generated by anger against corruption and over 11 million unemployed Brazilians, turned into apathy that has emptied the streets. For many, the focus is no longer on troubled government politics but on their own pockets. Others agree with former president Fernando Henrique Cardoso, of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party, who said of Mr. Temer in an interview that he was not his choice, but \u201cwhat\u2019s there is there!\u201dThe lack of ideological references and the anger directed at politicians led to the rise of extremists, like Congressman Jair Bolsonaro, who, in voting for impeachment, praised the head of the dictatorship\u2019s torture centers. Brazil now has the most conservative Congress in decades. The field is wide open for more extreme characters to win in the 2018 congressional elections.Ms. Rousseff\u2019s impeachment process did not bring up corruption charges against her, but rather of \u201cfiscal sidestepping,\u201d or \u201cpedaladas fiscais,\u201d breaking fiscal rules to hide the real budget deficit. That was for Congress a minor issue; the argument put forth by the majority was that she has lost the aptitude to govern.For Ms. Rousseff and her allies, impeachment is a coup attempt, a stand that generated strong reaction on the left. A Datafolha survey of Mr. Temer\u2019s presidential approval rating shows that 49 percent of Brazilians say they believe that democracy\u2019s rule of law has been followed during the impeachment process, while 37 percent think otherwise. Even if initial reactions have started to lapse into apathy, polling data shows a picture of a divided Brazilian society.Unlike the 1992 resignation of President Fernando Collor, which was brought on by corruption charges and considered progress for democratic institutions, Ms. Rousseff\u2019s exit leaves a trail of resentment. Though fractured and diminished, the P.T. is still the only genuinely popular party.On Aug. 24, Mr. da Silva did not join Ms. Rousseff in her last act as president. He went to Mato Grosso do Sul to visit a settlement of the Landless Workers\u2019 Movement, a group fighting for land reform. This group, together with the Unified Workers\u2019 Central, are the P.T.\u2019s two strongest organized movements. Returning to the social base that helped begin his political career, Mr. da Silva seems to be trying to start over.The yellow-green jersey of the Brazilian soccer team has been an emblem for the street rallies that favor impeachment. Participants want to stress their patriotism, but the image of masses wearing a soccer team uniform also works as an allegory of sorts for the country\u2019s situation. They act as fans who want to defeat their opponent; they had won a match, but not the tournament. The P.T. must reinvent itself; the other parties have yet to see the need to.Carol Pires is a political reporter at Piau\u00ed magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s Plan for a Fair Economy", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialMrs. Clinton says her first priority is to create jobs, primarily through public investments in infrastructure, like roads, bridges, school renovations, affordable housing, water systems, electrical grids, broadband internet and renewable energy.To help pay for the plan, initially $275 billion over five years, she has proposed several tax increases on high earners, including the \u201cBuffett rule\u201d for a minimum tax of 30 percent on those who make more than $1 million, a 4 percent surcharge on incomes over $5 million and a limit on deductions. Mr. Trump has also said he would rebuild the nation\u2019s infrastructure. But the multitrillion-dollar income tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy in his plan would preclude such investments. And his plan to repeal the estate tax, Mrs. Clinton rightly pointed out, would not help a vast majority of Americans and deplete the Treasury of hundreds of billion of dollars of revenue.Creating greater \u201cfairness\u201d in the economy is another priority for Mrs. Clinton \u2014 one to be achieved largely through tax policy changes. To help curb the decades-long trend of rising corporate profits and falling wages, she called for a new business tax credit to reward companies that have profit-sharing plans. Mr. Trump has said little about inequality and has no such proposal.On helping low-income workers, she wants to raise the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour; Mr. Trump would raise it to $10 an hour, a position he adopted only recently and after saying that pay was already too high.For young people and workers hoping to gain new skills, Mrs. Clinton would subsidize college costs, refinance and cap student loan repayments and develop job-training programs. None of these proposals would be affordable under Mr. Trump, given the size of his tax cuts.Child care is another area of sharp contrasts. Mrs. Clinton would use child tax credits and subsidies to cap child care costs at 10 percent of a family\u2019s income, ensuring that the biggest benefits flow to the lowest-income families. Mr. Trump would make child care costs tax deductible, which means the biggest benefits would flow to the highest-income households, while doing little or nothing for low-income families that can\u2019t afford child care.The sharpest contrast was on the economic importance of immigration reform. Rather than demonize undocumented workers, Mrs. Clinton acknowledged their work and their payment of taxes, and said that the goal was to end their exploitation that keeps wages low throughout the lower rungs of the economic ladder.She also left no doubt about her differences with Mr. Trump on trade. She vowed to stop any deal that costs jobs and depresses wages. But she was also clear that to \u201ccut ourselves off from the world\u201d would only kill more jobs. She pinpointed currency manipulation and intellectual-property theft as areas that need more reform.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s economic plan is not comprehensive. On corporate tax reform, for example, she has proposed piecemeal tax penalties to prevent corporations from moving abroad, as well as other measures to prevent corporate tax avoidance, but details on comprehensive change will probably depend on the composition of the next Congress.The plan Mrs. Clinton does have, however, is a good one. It is largely paid for. It is incremental, not sweeping, which is in keeping with political reality. And in contrast to the Trump plan, which has few details, it is specific enough that the \u201ceveryday Americans\u201d she has pledged to help can actually hold her accountable for what she has promised.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yellen Sees Stronger Case for Interest Rate Increase", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGRAND TETON NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. \u2014 Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, said on Friday that she saw a stronger case for raising the Fed\u2019s benchmark interest rate, suggesting the central bank was likely to act in the coming months.\u201cIn light of the continued solid performance of the labor market and our outlook for economic activity and inflation, I believe the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened in recent months,\u201d Ms. Yellen said.The remarks, delivered at an annual policy conference here, indicated that the Fed would consider raising rates at its next meeting in mid-September, though most analysts say they think the central bank is more likely to move in December.Stanley Fischer, the Fed\u2019s vice chairman, who has suggested in recent months that the economy is strong enough to move, told the cable business network CNBC that a strong August employment report, due Sept. 2, \u201cwould probably weigh in our decision.\u201dBut some officials remain nervous about the fragility of this long but tepid period of economic growth.The Fed also may be inclined to wait until after the presidential election in November, like earlier this year, when Fed officials said they did not want to raise rates before Britain\u2019s referendum on European Union membership in June.Ms. Yellen\u2019s speech \u201cleaves the Fed in a stance of watchful waiting, which is exactly where it was at the end of the last F.O.M.C. meeting in July,\u201d Kevin Logan, chief United States economist at HSBC, wrote in an analysis. \u201cPolicy makers are leaning toward a rate hike, but feel that they can wait until they are more confident that the expansion will continue at a sustainable pace.\u201dThe Fed raised interest rates in December for the first time since the financial crisis and predicted four more rate increases this year. Instead, it has kept its benchmark rate between 0.25 and 0.5 percent. Low rates encourage borrowing and risk-taking, which can bolster economic growth. Raising rates will gradually reduce that stimulus, and the Fed has been reluctant so far to take its foot off the gas.Ms. Yellen\u2019s remarks appeared aimed in part at jarring the complacency of investors who had concluded that the Fed would not raise rates in September. Fed officials have repeatedly warned that markets had too much confidence in the likely path of policy, given the central bank\u2019s considerable uncertainty about its own plans.Ms. Yellen underscored the point with a chart showing that Fed officials thought rates could plausibly end 2017 anywhere from nearly zero to 4 percent.Yet she also stopped short of echoing other Fed officials who have suggested in recent weeks that they are inclined to raise rates in September. The Fed\u2019s policy-making committee is scheduled to meet Sept. 20 and 21 in Washington.\u201cIt\u2019s not about trying to stop the economy from growing,\u201d Mr. Williams said, explaining his view that the economy no longer required quite as much help from the Fed. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep this economy growing; we are going to run it hot.\u201dYasenia Castro, a protester from Brooklyn, said at a demonstration before the meeting that she had not been able to find a full-time job since 2013. Ms. Castro, 35, has an associate degree in criminal justice and works weekends as a babysitter; she and her three children live with her mother to make ends meet.\u201cIf you\u2019re a Fed official, and you think the economy has recovered, tell me why I\u2019m still working as a babysitter when I have a degree,\u201d Ms. Castro said.Fed officials said repeatedly that they sympathized with the protesters, but they added that pushing too hard to increase employment could be counterproductive if it led to a recession. Those struggling now would likely suffer most.\u201cEverybody on this panel is painfully aware of what the costs of the last recession were and wants to avoid a future recession,\u201d Eric Rosengren, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said during the Thursday meeting.Much of Ms. Yellen\u2019s speech on Friday was devoted to the question of whether the central bank will be ready when the next recession inevitably comes.Even as the Fed moves to continue raising rates, officials expect that they will not rise nearly as much in the coming years as they did during previous periods of economic growth. That means the Fed will not be able to match the scale of the rate cuts it used to combat previous downturns. But Ms. Yellen said that the Fed in recent years had shown that other kinds of stimulus could also be effective.After cutting its benchmark rate to nearly zero, the Fed amplified the effect by promising to keep rates low. It also bought trillions of dollars in Treasury securities and mortgage bonds, forcing investors to accept lower interest rates.\u201cEven if average interest rates remain lower than in the past, I believe that monetary policy will, under most conditions, be able to respond effectively,\u201d Ms. Yellen said.Ms. Yellen added that the Fed was \u201cnot actively considering\u201d a range of other possible policy responses to a future crisis. These include buying assets other than Treasury securities, like municipal bonds, or raising the Fed\u2019s inflation target above 2 percent.She also noted that fiscal policy makers could play a role in addressing any future crises. In particular, she said, the government should consider policies that might increase the productivity of the American work force.\u201cFinally, and most ambitiously, as a society we should explore ways to raise productivity growth,\u201d Ms. Yellen said. Among the possibilities, she mentioned investment in education and infrastructure and reductions in regulation.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sydney Morning Herald Faces Uncertain Print Future in Australia", "Date": "2016-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey pushed for women to get the vote in Australia\u2019s national elections. They brought down a central bank board member. And they helped convict a state official.The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and their sister publications at Fairfax Media have been among the most powerful voices in Australia for more than 150 years, shaping public opinion on politics, exposing shady business practices and targeting vast criminal operations. Once mocked as a \u201cGranny\u201d for its cautious, worldly perspective, The Herald long ago embraced the reputation and the nickname.But Fairfax\u2019s newspapers now face a diminished future, with company executives even discussing whether to stop printing The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age on weekdays. If they do, it would signal a new low in the decline of the global newspaper business, the radical retreat of centuries-old, mainstream metropolitan newspapers with national influence.The prospect has dismayed many Australians who wonder what it means for civic life and what it says about the country\u2019s place in the world. Australians consider themselves a highly informed and highly educated society, despite their geographic isolation. And The Herald and Age, with a history of sending correspondents to far-flung locales like the battlefields of Europe and Southeast Asia, have been central to the discourse.The weakening of independent voices like The Herald also leaves the Australian market increasingly dominated by the partisan agenda of News Corporation, which owns the country\u2019s top three newspapers by weekday circulation. The struggles at Fairfax represent an especially satisfying victory for News Corporation, run by the homegrown billionaire Rupert Murdoch, who turned his family\u2019s original asset \u2014 a single provincial Australian newspaper \u2014 into a global media empire. Although News Corporation has faced its own financial strains, its other successful businesses, like a real estate website, have provided better support for its journalistic operations.Trouble at Fairfax Media \u201cconstitutes a crisis in civic journalism in our country, because the resources will no longer be there,\u201d said Eric Beecher, a former top editor at The Herald and at News Corporation who is now the publisher of Crikey, a news website. \u201cThe Age and The Sydney Morning Herald have always done the heavy lifting of civic journalism and investigative journalism.\u201dEven by the newspaper industry\u2019s standards, readers of Australia\u2019s print newspapers have been declining at an unusually rapid rate.The chief executive for Fairfax Media, Greg Hywood, said the company had not made a decision whether to halt weekday printing, although it was under review. If printing is halted, he said, the company\u2019s journalistic approach would not be affected.\u201cOur readers have never been hungrier for good-quality news reporting,\u201d Mr. Hywood said.When The Herald opened its state-of-the-art, $260 million presses in 1995, the newspaper\u2019s Saturday edition was a hefty 400 pages. The company predicted it would easily grow to 600 pages.After all, The Herald and the rest of the Fairfax Media papers had practically cornered the market in Sydney and Melbourne for classified advertising for cars, jobs and real estate. Those so-called rivers of gold helped support a robust reporting operation.\u201cWe wondered how on earth we would print a paper that size,\u201d said Mr. Hywood, who was once the Washington correspondent for another Fairfax newspaper, The Australian Financial Review.It was also the same year that Fairfax started its first digital news site, in retrospect, roughly the peak for the print business.The Saturday edition has now shrunk to around 200 pages. Fairfax has cut more than 500 jobs at city newspapers over the last five years, including 100 in April, according to Australia\u2019s union for journalists. And last year The Herald\u2019s cherished printing presses were sold for $34 million.The headwinds now buffeting The Herald and Age are global, as the internet erodes the protections once afforded by geography. There\u2019s the ubiquitous competition from Facebook and Google. Digital native publications like BuzzFeed and The Huffington Post each have small Australian newsrooms without the sizable costs of legacy papers like The Herald.The \u201crivers of gold\u201d have evaporated. Advertising and subscriptions have particularly wilted on weekdays; weekends now represent two-thirds of the revenues at Fairfax\u2019s major newspapers.In the sign of the depths of the print problems, the company this month wrote off much of its investment in the newspapers. Fairfax\u2019s main saving grace has been its fast-growing real estate website, Domain, which has helped offset the losses.Such industry challenges forced papers in some large American cities to rethink their print presence years ago. The Times-Picayune of New Orleans cut printing to three days a week, while The Seattle Post-Intelligencer is online only. Facing cutthroat competition in the crowded British market, The Independent in London, which started in the 1980s to shake up the media establishment, went digital this year.Some of The Herald\u2019s wounds were self-inflicted.As the dot-com boom took off and media companies moved online, Fairfax separated its digital operations, in the hope of eventually taking the group public. At The Herald, there were two newsrooms, one for the newspaper and one for the web.The division created a rift. A younger online staff chased clicks, loading the site up with gossip-fueled content, heavy on sex, celebrity and crime. It rankled more seasoned veterans in the print newsroom, who lamented the shift away from weightier topics like the domestic economy and global politics.\u201cIt was viewed that online there was a lot more Paris Hilton than Paris, France, and that to win online you needed to be a tabloid newspaper,\u201d said Mark Scott, a former Fairfax executive who most recently served as chief executive of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. \u201cThe Herald\u2019s strength had always been its great quality, broadsheet traditions.\u201dThe newsrooms were eventually merged and the website now takes a somewhat more balanced approach. But stories about Kylie Jenner\u2019s Vogue cover and the abs of Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, are still intermingled online with more hard-hitting newspaper articles about the terror links in a child care fraud and the serious flaws in the country\u2019s census.Like many media operations, Fairfax is trying to strike a difficult balance. The meatier topics may play well to the newspaper audience, generally an older crowd. But Mr. Hywood, the Fairfax chief, said that online readers, who skew younger, want a broader mix.In terms of readers, the digital strategy appears to be clicking. The Herald is the nation\u2019s leading website, by the number of paying subscribers.\u201cThat can be criticized by people who prefer highbrow content,\u201d said Megan Brownlow, an executive director in the Sydney offices of PricewaterhouseCoopers, the consulting firm. \u201cBut when you\u2019re in a numbers game like internet advertising, highbrow content is hard to monetize.\u201dEven so, it strikes a nerve within the newsroom, which worries about losing its voice within Australian society.The ranks of The Herald, like so many newspapers around the world, have been decimated by cuts over the years. Reporters have gone on strike, deriding the rounds of job losses.Some losses have cut to the core. Four years ago, 70 journalists were laid off within one week. Gone were the urban affairs editor, a senior political correspondent, a specialist feature writer, a senior business reporter, the health editor, arts editor and senior crime reporter.Mr. Hywood denies that reporters are now thin on the ground.

{"Headline": "Colombia and FARC Reach Deal to End the Americas\u2019 Longest War", "Date": "2016-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byColombia\u2019s government and the largest rebel group in the country have reached a deal to end more than 50 years of conflict, the two sides announced Wednesday, paving the way for an end to the longest-running war in the Americas.This time, the two sides declared that a final deal had been clinched.\u201cToday begins the end of the suffering, the pain and the tragedy of war,\u201d President Juan Manuel Santos said in a nationally televised address after the agreement was announced. \u201cLet\u2019s open the door together to a new stage in our history.\u201dBut to most Colombians, the deal is simply a promise that the war, which has lasted 52 years, claimed some 220,000 lives and displaced more than five million people, is at last coming to an end.Peace in Colombia now looks more likely than ever, but a big hurdle still needs to be cleared before the deal is ratified. Mr. Santos, who has staked his legacy on a deal, must now sell it to his people, who will be asked to vote in an up-or-down referendum.Rallying against that approval is Mr. Santos\u2019s predecessor, former President \u00c1lvaro Uribe, whose term ended in 2010 with the FARC diminished.Mr. Uribe is widely credited with the military gains that forced the rebels to the negotiating table. But he is now leading a growing campaign against the deal, saying it amounts to an unjust amnesty for the rebels.\u201cThey will spend zero days in prison, they will be awarded with political representation,\u201d Paloma Valencia, a senator in Mr. Uribe\u2019s party, said of the rebels. \u201cThis deal breaks the rule of law.\u201dStill, others hailed the deal as a major step for a country of 50 million people whose growing economy has long been hampered by the simple fact that the state does not control all of its territory.\u201cIt\u2019s an enormous opportunity for the country to create a democratic state, which will allow us to live in peace,\u201d said Maria Emma Wills, a political analyst at the National Center for Historical Memory, a government research group.She warned, \u201cThe deal has strong political opposition, and the next job is going to be public advocacy for it.\u201dThe war remains one of the most emotionally charged issues in Colombia, characterized by kidnappings and the massacre of civilians caught between the rebels and the military. Waves of Colombians left the country fearing the violence. Few who remained were untouched by it.Now the two sides say they have settled many of the last sticking points that kept them at loggerheads for years.But even if the deal is approved by the public, its success is anything but guaranteed.How will thousands of guerrillas \u2014 many of whom were kidnapped as children and know only life in the jungle \u2014 find their way into mainstream society, and will they be accepted there?Two FARC peace negotiators were named in a 2006 federal indictment, charged with helping to make the organization a narcotics powerhouse responsible for more than \u201c60 percent of the cocaine sent to the United States.\u201dStill, the peace deal makes wide-ranging promises to reshape a post-conflict Colombia.In a nod to longstanding grievances among the rebels, the government promised to make significant investments in rural areas, which the rebels say have long been neglected at the expense of cities like Bogot\u00e1.Far more contentious, however, has been the subject of what will become of the rebels themselves.For decades, the FARC financed its insurgency by kidnapping people and holding them for ransom, a business that terrorized thousands, including a former presidential candidate who was held for years.The agreement tries to resolve past grievances with the stroke of a pen: Under a so-called transitional justice system, all but the most grievous crimes may be resolved with reduced sentences.Silvio Hern\u00e1ndez, whose son Erik was a soldier killed by the rebels in combat in 2011, said he felt the agreement would not bring justice.\u201cThe FARC are not going to pay for the crime against my son,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s good that we are reaching peace, but this leaves me with many doubts.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A.N.C. Suffers Major Election Setback in South Africa", "Date": "2016-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJOHANNESBURG \u2014 The African National Congress, the party that helped liberate black South Africans from white-minority rule but has become mired in corruption, endured its worst election since taking power after the end of apartheid, according to results released on Friday.In the biggest shake-up of the nation\u2019s post-apartheid political order, the A.N.C. lost power in at least one big black-majority city, Nelson Mandela Bay, for the first time.The main beneficiary of widespread dissatisfaction in the country was the Democratic Alliance, a political party that was traditionally led by white South Africans who opposed apartheid but now has many young black leaders. During the campaign, the A.N.C. attacked the Democratic Alliance as a Trojan horse for white interests.By late Friday evening, it was locked in extremely tight races over Johannesburg, the commercial capital, and Pretoria, the seat of government \u2014 an unthinkable predicament for a party whose leader, President Jacob Zuma, was so confident of endless victories that he has said that his party would rule \u201cuntil Jesus comes.\u201dNationwide, with 98 percent of ballots counted in this week\u2019s municipal elections, the A.N.C. garnered 54 percent of the vote \u2014 its lowest level in an election since 1994, when Mr. Mandela became president and the party became South Africa\u2019s dominant political force.The decline in support for the A.N.C. was especially sharp in the nation\u2019s eight major cities, where a growing number of black, middle-class voters turned against the politics of patronage personified by Mr. Zuma and increasingly resisted the A.N.C.\u2019s emotive appeals to its heroic past.\u201cWe\u2019re waking up to a new political scene in South Africa,\u201d said William Gumede, a political scientist at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. \u201cPeople are clearly not voting anymore based on the past. They\u2019re now voting on the current reality of poor service delivery and the Zuma presidency.\u201dCyril Ramaphosa, the deputy president of the A.N.C. and of the nation, said at a news conference on Friday afternoon that the organization would \u201cdo an introspective look at ourselves.\u201d\u201cWe are a party that\u2019s not going away from the body politic of this country,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere we have shown areas of weakness, we are going to get better and improve. That\u2019s who we are. We learn from our mistakes.\u201dMr. Ramaphosa, who is considered a leading contender to succeed Mr. Zuma as the A.N.C.\u2019s presidential candidate in 2019, sounded contrite, in a possible sign of how the party might try to regroup.\u201cThey think that we are arrogant,\u201d he said of voters, \u201cthey think that we are self-centered, they think that we are self-serving, and I\u2019d like to dispute all of that and say we are a listening organization.\u201dMr. Zuma\u2019s seven years in office have been marked by a series of scandals, including the use of millions of dollars in government funds to renovate his private home; accusations that Indian businessmen close to him offered to dole out powerful government posts in exchange for favorable treatment; and Mr. Zuma\u2019s appointment of allies with little experience to important positions in government and state-owned companies.The party\u2019s poor showing this week also showed the extent of frustration over the economy, which has been made worse by Mr. Zuma\u2019s erratic decisions, and anger over one of the world\u2019s highest levels of income inequality.The A.N.C.\u2019s enduring grip on rural areas dependent on the party\u2019s deeply rooted patronage network will most likely ensure its dominance on the national stage for another decade, according to experts and even to officials in the opposition.But pressure could mount on party leaders to replace Mr. Zuma before the end of his second and final term, in 2019.The A.N.C.\u2019s national tally was about eight percentage points lower than the 62 percent it received in the most recent local elections, in 2011.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge drop,\u201d said Prince Mashele, the executive director of the Center for Politics and Research, a private group. \u201cThis means that the A.N.C. was rejected by its core constituents \u2014 meaning that there is something fundamentally wrong that the A.N.C. has done to offend them.\u201dFor the opposition Democratic Alliance, the election results are the first significant victories outside of its stronghold in the western part of the country. Whites and South Africans of mixed race make up the party\u2019s core supporters in that area, and blacks make up only about one-third of the population there.The Democratic Alliance retained Cape Town, the nation\u2019s second-biggest city, with a landslide victory. The party now controls at least two of the nation\u2019s eight biggest cities.Mmusi Maimane, who last year became the Democratic Alliance\u2019s first black leader, claimed victory in the mayoral race in Pretoria on Friday, with more than 10 percent of the votes still left to be tallied. The A.N.C. did not concede.Under Mr. Maimane, 36, who grew up in Soweto, the Democratic Alliance appears to have made inroads even in A.N.C. strongholds, especially among young voters whose image of the A.N.C. has less to do with Mr. Mandela than with Mr. Zuma.\u201cI wanted change,\u201d said Tebogo Malatjie, an unemployed 22-year-old man in Soweto who voted for the first time for the Democratic Alliance. \u201cYou cannot vote for the A.N.C. if you want change.\u201dVoters in Nelson Mandela Bay \u2014 South Africa\u2019s fifth-biggest municipality, which includes Port Elizabeth and whose population is 60 percent black \u2014 chose as its new mayor Athol Trollip, 52, a white South African from the Democratic Alliance with a long career in progressive politics. He is fluent in Xhosa, the dominant African language in his region.But the Democratic Alliance failed to win a majority there and will have to form a coalition government with one or more smaller parties, possibly the Economic Freedom Fighters, a leftist party that came in third nationwide with 8 percent.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Sausage Party\u2019 Is an Animated Sex Comedy About Food ... and God", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a nutshell \u2014 in a brightly colored, economy-size value pack \u2014 \u201cSausage Party\u201d traces the dialectic of enlightenment in the life of a skeptical sausage named Frank. Voiced by Seth Rogen in his usual growly, loud-Canadian manner, Frank starts out as a true believer. At the beginning of every day, the groceries sing a hymn (by Alan Menken) praising \u201cthe gods\u201d who will escort the chosen foodstuffs into \u201cthe great beyond.\u201d Since the Fourth of July is approaching, Frank and his buddies think their turn is coming, which means that Frank and his girlfriend, a comely bun named Brenda (Kristen Wiig), will at last be able to shed their packaging and consummate their relationship.The gods, needless to say, are ordinary human shoppers, and the glorious apotheosis they bring to Frank and Brenda\u2019s friends and neighbors is painful, brutal death. But the innocent condiments, meat products, beverages and specialty foods who populate the store\u2019s garish and crowded aisles don\u2019t know that. They think nirvana awaits beyond the cash registers. Not that ignorance is bliss, exactly. There are schisms and antagonisms based on territory and belief \u2014 most piquantly represented by the enmity between a bagel (Edward Norton) and a lavash (David Krumholtz) \u2014 and a repressive sexual morality underwritten by fear of the gods.But then Frank \u2014 and, separately, his pal Barry (Michael Cera) \u2014 glimpse the truth, aided by a problematically branded bottle of liquor (Bill Hader) and a wad of chewed gum (Scott Underwood). The truth is horrible. Think for a moment about how we must look to the food we eat. After such knowledge, what forgiveness? But if the gods are really monsters and the great beyond is a killing field, what is to be done?A blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it poke at Pixar both acknowledges an obvious debt to the \u201cToy Story\u201d movies and emphasizes the philosophical challenge that \u201cSausage Party\u201d marshals against them. This is more than a matter of answering sweetness with swear words. The \u201cToy Story\u201d cycle takes the relationship between people and consumer goods to be essentially harmonious. Buzz and Woody and their friends accept their place in the cosmos, and though there are shadows of doubt and inklings of tragedy in all of the movies, everything unfolds within the parameters of a fundamentally rational and benevolent order. People love their playthings, and the toys love us back.In some ways, \u201cSausage Party\u201d is closer in spirit to \u201cThe Lego Movie,\u201d which raised its own set of metaphysical questions. But whereas that movie was a Calvinist parable of free will in a determined universe (with no sex or profanity), this one focuses on the disruptive and liberating consequences of scientific thought. Frank is a Promethean figure, and what happens once the gods are overthrown is scary and unsettling as well as fun.Animation offers Mr. Rogen, Mr. Goldberg and their squad new ways to be naughty, and also blunts the potential offensiveness of some of the older ways. Since ethnic stereotypes figure so heavily in retail branding and advertising, the spicy taco (voiced by Salma Hayek) and the neurotic bagel can be interpreted as satirical jabs at the food industry rather than insults aimed at groups of actual people. Maybe you will say the same about the effeminate Twinkie (Mr. Underwood) and the African-American box of grits (Craig Robinson), or maybe you won\u2019t, but chances are you will laugh anyway. I did, without much guilt.And with, I have to say, quite a bit of respect for the intellectual rigor of a project that probably didn\u2019t require it. I went in expecting an earnest critique of the industrial food system, or an impassioned plea for ethical vegetarianism. O.K., not really. But I certainly didn\u2019t anticipate a movie so full of \u2026 thought. \u201cSausage Party\u201d is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

{"Headline": "Cuomo\u2019s $15 Million High-Tech Film Studio? It\u2019s a Flop", "Date": "2016-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe studio \u2014 called the Central New York Hub for Emerging Nano Industries \u2014 would create at least 350 high-tech jobs, and would, according to Mr. Cuomo, effectively bring Hollywood to central New York.The state\u2019s investment in the Central New York Hub, in many ways, embodies the Cuomo administration\u2019s pledge to revive the economy outside the New York City area, often by offering tax breaks and capital investments to lure or maintain businesses.Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has strongly defended these efforts. And in the case of the film hub, the governor\u2019s office praised its early efforts, citing several productions that have used already the hub, employing hundreds of workers short term. Administration officials also argued that the governor\u2019s promises of hundreds of jobs was meant to reflect a seven-year buildup, and they were not meant to be full-time jobs.\u201cBy definition, jobs at the film hub are temporary because they are based on the production of specific and finite projects,\u201d John Kelly, a spokesman for the governor, said.But the hub\u2019s slow start seems to raise more questions about the state\u2019s job-creation policies, and why the Cuomo administration paired with such a little-known company.\u201cWe\u2019re just a small start-up company,\u201d said Michael Haggerty, FilmHouse\u2019s chief operating officer, that \u201cjust happened to be lucky enough to have the governor announce our company.\u201dMr. Haggerty, like some of the FilmHouse executives, has little previous experience in movies: He is a former Albany police detective.All told, Mr. Johnson still owes at least $1.6 million, according to public records and plaintiffs, as a result of those legal decisions, involving deals in which he vowed to place investors in major creative roles despite their having few professional film credits. Another suit, involving nonpayment of film crew workers, found him liable for $100,000.Even FilmHouse\u2019s physical headquarters are difficult to determine. The company\u2019s website suggests that it is based in a grand building in downtown Albany associated with the State University of New York Polytechnic Institute, the primary force behind the film hub and many of the governor\u2019s upstate economic plans. But the company has no office in the building.The company\u2019s listed Los Angeles office does not exist; the address leads to a Sephora in a strip mall in Marina del Rey, Calif. The company\u2019s mailing address in New York seems more accurate: It traces to a small mailbox in a United Parcel Service store about six miles north of Albany. (The website lists it as \u201cSuite 263,\u201d the P.O. box\u2019s number.)The film hub, outside Syracuse, exhibited few signs of life on a recent visit; the parking lot was empty, as were most of its offices and studio spaces. It was built by COR Development, a frequent and generous contributor to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign coffers.COR was listed in a subpoena issued to the governor\u2019s office in late April in a federal investigation of the Buffalo Billion, the governor\u2019s billion-dollar bet on nanotech in that long-beleaguered city. The exact scope of those investigations is unclear, and no one associated with COR has been accused of a crime.In an interview, Mr. Johnson defended his company, saying it had projects ready to go but suggesting the film hub still needed work. \u201cThe hub needs to finish providing, you know, just basic equipment and services and all that stuff that they don\u2019t yet,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not fully operational.\u201dFor its part, SUNY Polytechnic says the traditional meaning of \u201ctenant\u201d is misleading in this instance. \u201cThe hub tenants bring productions, jobs and investments to the region in exchange for tenancy and access to facilities during production,\u201d Jerry Gretzinger, a SUNY Polytechnic spokesman, said. \u201cWhile there is potential for them to maintain day-to-day employees at the facility, it is not a requirement.\u201dThe university also noted that several past productions at the hub had each created at least 125 temporary jobs in addition to hiring over 100 extras, though such work sometimes pays little.All of which impressed Mr. Haggerty. \u201cRyan\u2019s a really creative guy. He\u2019s really hooked up in Hollywood; he knows everybody out there,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s very well liked.\u201dBut in June Mr. Johnson was cited in a motion for summary judgment in State Supreme Court in Manhattan related to a 2012 case in which he and several former business partners were found to have defaulted on a $150,000 promissory note after pledging to produce a film called \u201cSweetwater.\u201d All told, Mr. Johnson now owes more than $1.3 million \u2014 plus interest and legal fees in relation to that case \u2014 according to public records.\u201cThey were using my equity, instead of putting it toward the project, they were using it to cover their own expenses and to cover shortfalls they had in other projects,\u201d Mr. Batz said, calling the endeavor \u201ca shell game.\u201dMr. Johnson also owes more than $350,000 from two lawsuits associated with a failed 2011 project, \u201cMississippi Wild,\u201d in which he was accused of not paying a group of union tradesmen as well as bilking an investor, Daniel Fainman, after promising him a lead role and a producing credit on the film, which was never made.\u201cThey completely scammed me,\u201d said Mr. Fainman, 25, who gave Mr. Johnson and his partners $253,000 for the film. Like Mr. Batz, Mr. Fainman said he had yet to receive any money from Mr. Johnson.Mr. Johnson said his legal issues would be settled soon and disputed the facts, saying, for instance, that Mr. Fainman had threatened him, something Mr. Fainman denies. \u201cI just asked for my money back,\u201d Mr. Fainman said.As for Mr. Batz, Mr. Johnson said he planned to make good \u201cin the next month or three\u201d but blamed the failed production on an unexpected delay related to Ms. Carey\u2019s becoming pregnant.Robert S. Giolito, who represented members of the \u201cMississippi Wild\u201d crew, said he had obtained a $100,000 judgment from Federal District Court in Los Angeles after Mr. Johnson reneged on a settlement agreement over unpaid wages. And in 2014, he filed the California judgment with Federal District Court in Syracuse to try to recover that money. \u201cThe minute we find him, we will attempt to make him make good,\u201d Mr. Giolito said.He added that he was amazed that the state went into business with Mr. Johnson, whom he described as \u201ca very personable guy\u201d who \u201cowes a lot of money.\u201dBut Mr. Johnson said he had paid Mr. Giolito\u2019s clients, and that he was being sought for benefits for which he should not be liable. Mr. Giolito said he was not aware of \u201canyone getting paid by Ryan Johnson.\u201dOthers on the FilmHouse team are also linked to debts, according to public records. Its chief strategy officer, Scott E. McIntyre, is an entrepreneur based in Ohio who owes the Internal Revenue Service more than $1 million; its senior vice president, Kent W. Purdy, owes more than $40,000 in state and local taxes. Attempts to reach Mr. Purdy for comment were unsuccessful. Mr. McIntyre said he was a part-time worker with the company, but did not comment on the lien.SUNY Polytechnic seemed aware of Mr. Johnson\u2019s legal troubles, but not troubled by them. \u201cIt is apparent that an occasional unsuccessful project and associated legal matters are not uncommon in the film industry,\u201d Mr. Gretzinger said.\u201cWe go up there,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen there\u2019s a movie to be made there.\u201dNoah Gilbert contributed reporting from Marina del Rey, Calif.

{"Headline": "What Poor Nations Need to Get By: Money From Migrants", "Date": "2016-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat in the WorldAmid all the mudslinging and soul-searching about global migration, one thing is often overlooked: the money.For developing countries, the money sent home by native sons and daughters was more than three times as much as those countries received in foreign aid.The diaspora kicked in especially in the aftermath of natural disasters like the 2015 earthquake in Nepal, when money sent home by Nepalese abroad helped many victims survive.Countries like India and Egypt that send many laborers to Persian Gulf countries saw their remittances dip last year because of falling oil prices, the World Bank found. Countries like Tajikistan, whose citizens often work in Russia, were hit even harder because the Russian ruble also slid in value.Even so, remittances have become crucial to relieving some of the world\u2019s poorest people from hunger and want, just as they have become a major revenue source for a number of fragile nations.Here are some more examples of places where remittances account for a big chunk of the economy.\u2022 Tajikistan: 37 percent.\u2022 Kyrgyzstan: 30 percent.\u2022 Tonga: 27 percent.\u2022 Liberia: 24 percent.\u2022 Haiti: 23 percent.\u2022 The West Bank and the Gaza Strip: 17 percent.\u2022 Lebanon: 16 percent.Where is all this money coming from? A lot of it is earned in the United States, where immigrants sent $54 billion in remittances to their home countries in 2015. Saudi Arabia was next with $37 billion.Those global money flows are a business in themselves, with companies like Western Union profiting handsomely. Transaction costs can take a substantial bite: The world average is about 7 percent for a $200 transfer. When countries around the world signed on to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, one thing they pledged to do was get those fees down to 3 percent or less.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Racial Violence in Milwaukee Was Decades in the Making, Residents Say", "Date": "2016-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe burning buildings, smashed police cars and scuffles between police officers and angry protesters on Milwaukee\u2019s north side over the weekend might have seemed like a spontaneous eruption.But for many in the city\u2019s marginalized black community, it was an explosive release decades in the making.Milwaukee is one of the United States\u2019 most segregated cities, where black men are incarcerated or unemployed at some of the highest rates in the country, and where the difference in poverty between black and white residents is about one and a half times the national average. There are barren lots and worn-down homes all over the predominantly black north side, while mostly white crowds traffic through the restaurants and boutiques downtown, or inhabit the glossy lakefront high rises.\u201cThis isn\u2019t just, \u2018Oh, my gosh, all of a sudden this happened,\u2019\u201d said Sharlen Moore, 39, who lives in Sherman Park, the mostly African-American neighborhood where the shooting and unrest occurred. \u201cIt\u2019s a series of things that has happened over a period of time. And right now you shake a soda bottle and you open the top and it explodes, and this is what it is.\u201dMilwaukee, a city of nearly 600,000, joins other embattled parts of the country like Baltimore and Ferguson, Mo., where police killings did not so much draw outrage for the deaths alone, but for the systemic problems that have so many black people feeling hopeless.In some ways, city officials had been bracing for, if not expecting, a surge of unrest.After federal prosecutors declined last year to charge a former Milwaukee police officer in the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man, the city\u2019s police chief, Edward A. Flynn, asked the Justice Department to work with his department to examine its patterns and practices. The review, Chief Flynn has insisted, would show that his department was doing things right and committed to transparency.In that shooting from 2014, the victim, Dontre Hamilton, had a history of mental illness and had been sleeping in a park when the officer, Christopher Manney, approached him. Mr. Manney, who was cleared of any criminal wrongdoing, said that Mr. Hamilton, 31, had grabbed his baton and hit him, though some witnesses disputed that account.Chief Flynn received praise from some black people for firing Mr. Manney, but some criticized the chief because he refused to say that the shooting itself was unjustified.\u201cAt the end of the day, he\u2019s going to support his officers, even when wrong is wrong,\u201d Ms. Moore said.The authorities are still investigating whether the officer in Saturday\u2019s shooting did anything wrong. The police have so far said that two men ran from a car, one of them was armed and when he refused orders to drop his gun, an officer fatally shot him.In his two and a half decades as a Milwaukee police officer, Cedric Jackson said he did not feel that supervisors appropriately addressed concerns of wrongdoing within the department. One common practice, he said, was that after catching suspects who ran, officers would rough them up.\u201cIf they caught you in a backyard or alleyway, they\u2019d want to beat you up,\u201d said Mr. Jackson, who is black and retired in 2011.His complaints about that custom to colleagues and supervisors were ignored, he said. As was the dismay he expressed about how officers policed communities that were predominantly black. White officers, he said, \u201creally viewed blacks as less than them or animals or not deserving of respect.\u201dThat is how Noble Durrah, 17, said he felt he was treated one day when he was walking home from school with his 4-year-old niece. The police appeared to be chasing someone and they ran through an alley and stopped him. A white officer grabbed him, he said, shoved him down and swore at him as he told him not to move.The officer continued his chase and then returned to ask him questions, Mr. Durrah said. \u201cI was like, \u2018You just pushed me down and was roughing on me, and you expect me to tell you stuff,\u2019\u201d Mr. Durrah recalled.Timothy Durrah, 53, Noble\u2019s great-uncle, added that \u201cMilwaukee is one of the most prejudiced cities there is.\u201dThat problem, some residents say, began from the time black people started migrating to Milwaukee in large numbers in the second half of the 20th century.They settled there as the city\u2019s manufacturing economy began to dwindle, when jobs disappeared or moved to the suburbs. Many black people found themselves trapped in substandard living conditions on the north side without stable jobs to help them reach a better life.While historians do not point to a single inciting event for that riot, it came at a time of growing resentment over housing segregation, poor schools and the construction of highways that wiped out many black businesses and households in Bronzeville, which was the economic heart of black Milwaukee.\u201cUnless something is done about the uninhabitable conditions that the black man has to live in, Milwaukee could become a holocaust,\u201d the Rev. James E. Groppi, a leading civil rights activist at the time, told the City Council five days before the 1967 riot started, according to The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.Father Groppi, who died in 1985, eventually would lead 200 straight days of protests, and the city finally passed its fair housing law after Congress passed its landmark federal legislation in 1968.But while many formal discriminatory barriers have fallen, many black residents of Milwaukee today see a persistent racial divide that they say has created an urgency similar to what Father Groppi expressed decades ago.\u201cThe people have been calm,\u201d Dontre Hamilton\u2019s brother, Nate, told reporters two years ago after local prosecutors declined to file charges. \u201cThe people have not stood up. So when will we stand up?\u201dImbalances in mortgage lending continue to stifle homeownership and devalue predominantly black areas. A study released last month by National Community Reinvestment Coalition found that while black people made up 16 percent of the metro population in 2014, they received only 4 percent of the loans.While court-ordered and voluntary desegregation programs had helped to usher in school integration by 1987, those programs have since faded and schools in the metropolitan area are as segregated now as they were in 1965. Nearly three in four black students attend schools where at least 90 percent of the students are not white, according to Marc V. Levine, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Only 15.7 percent of Milwaukee Public School students tested proficient in reading in 2013-14, and 20.3 percent in math.And even those people fortunate enough to graduate from these highly segregated schools have a grim outlook. Nearly one out of every eight black men in Milwaukee County has served time behind bars, according to a 2013 University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee study. The black unemployment rate in Milwaukee County is 20 percent, nearly three times greater than for white people.These social ills foster a grim cycle, said Reggie Moore, who is the director of the city\u2019s Office of Violence Prevention and is married to Ms. Moore. They create transient communities with a lot of poverty, he said, where residents are less likely to be invested and engaged in what is going on, which allows crime to fester more easily.Tackling the root causes of crime would be the most effective way to make the community safer and calm tensions, he said.\u201cI think it\u2019s a matter of having a dual conversation about what justice needs to look like in this particular situation, but also the broader conversation of what a just community looks like,\u201d Mr. Moore said. \u201cWhat are the systemic issues that need to be addressed around poverty, racism, segregation and inequity to reduce the likelihood of this happening again?\u201dKay Nolan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "When Every Company Is a Tech Company, Does the Label Matter?", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesApple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon have created something of a watershed moment in the stock market.They became the four most valuable companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index at the close of trading on Aug. 1, according to S.&P.\u2019s official tally. That meant that tech companies, by one common definition, occupied the four top spots in the market capitalization rankings, a rare and brief occurrence.\u201cIt may never have happened before at the close of trading,\u201d said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. The full history of daily rankings isn\u2019t readily available, however, so we can\u2019t be certain, and such rankings are evanescent, shifting with every tick of the stock market. In fact, on Friday, Amazon dropped back into sixth place.But no matter: The early August rankings were a reminder of how far tech has come. It is a dominant force in the stock market and the economy, one so all-encompassing that tech may no longer even be a useful concept for understanding today\u2019s stock market.One of them is Exxon Mobil, the energy giant and the most valuable company in the S.&P. as recently as 2012. But Exxon Mobil has been cut down in size by the oil price debacle. The other is Berkshire Hathaway, Warren E. Buffett\u2019s conglomerate, which the S.&P. categorizes as a financial services company \u2014 the only such company left in the Top 10 market cap list. Berkshire announced its own earnings after trading closed on Friday. We\u2019ll soon learn whether the market is pleased enough to vault Berkshire further ahead of Amazon.The three tech companies at the very top in market cap \u2014 Apple, Google and Microsoft \u2014 have held high positions for a long while. (Google, ranked second, trades as Alphabet, the name of its parent company.) Google passed Apple in value briefly this year, but Apple regained the top perch, which it has held since 2012. Microsoft, now No. 3, was the most valuable company during the last tech boom, in the early 2000s.Virtually no one disputes S.&P.\u2019s formal classification of Apple, Google and Microsoft as \u201cinformation technology\u201d companies. The same is true of Facebook, which held seventh place in the latest list of most valuable companies. But while Amazon is often described as a tech company \u2014 and undoubtedly uses and creates innovative technology \u2014 S.&P. has never classified it as one.In fact, Amazon is formally known as a \u201cconsumer discretionary company,\u201d like Walmart, which it has displaced as a member of the Top 10 most valuable companies. Amazon is the only consumer discretionary company left in the Top 10. Is it in some sense a tech company? Certainly, and we\u2019ll get back to that.But the same can be said, to one degree or another, about the three other members of the Top 10 \u2014 old companies that are still prospering in large part because of their mastery of advanced technologies. Johnson & Johnson, for example, which is ranked eighth, is a health care company, yet it is heavily involved in technology of a biological kind. Then there is General Electric, the diversified industrial company (and, until recently, also a financial services company), once described as a bellwether for the entire market. It conducts advanced research and sells tech products.Last on the list is AT&T, a telecommunications company, which, in an early form, helped create computer languages and operating systems on which modern tech companies are built. In 1957, when the S.&P. 500 was born, an ancestral version of AT&T was the most valuable company in the United States by a very wide margin, said Jeremy J. Siegel, a Wharton business school professor, the author of \u201cStocks for the Long Run\u201d and a market historian.\u201cAT&T back then was a highly regulated old phone company,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a giant, later broken up into smaller companies. And it was an outlier, because the other big companies in the S.&P. 500 in that era were mainly materials companies \u2014 like United States Steel, DuPont and Union Carbide \u2014 and an awful lot of oil companies.\u201dIn 1957, the economy ran on oil, and the biggest energy company was Standard Oil of New Jersey \u2014 an ancestor of Exxon Mobil. No pure tech company ranked in the Top 10 back then, not even IBM, which soon became the dominant tech company, a position it held until Microsoft surpassed it in the mid-1990s. That was the decade of the great tech boom, culminating in the bubble that burst in March 2000. Microsoft was No. 1 in market cap at the end of 1999, and four other tech companies \u2014 Cisco Systems, Intel, IBM and America Online \u2014 were also among the Top 10 most valuable companies. The stock market celebrated tech\u2019s ascendance then, as it does now.But this is a different era. When you dig deeper into the S.&P. 500, it\u2019s clear that while the valuations of tech companies swelled to unrealistically high proportions in those bubble years, the valuations of most companies are far more modest now. In March 2000, the height of the bubble, the value of information technology companies swelled to 34.5 percent of the total market cap of the S.&P. 500. At the moment, the comparable figure is only 20.7 percent, data from the Bespoke Investment Group shows. That\u2019s not much more than the 15.7 percent share of financial companies or the 15.2 percent share of the health care sector. By contrast, finance ballooned as high as 22.3 percent at the end of 2006, in what can be seen in hindsight as a financial bubble.On the other hand, materials and energy companies, which together constituted almost half of the total value of the S.&P. 500 in 1957, now account for less than 10 percent of it. That reflects the collapse of energy and commodity prices over the last few years, and it may well be a temporary phenomenon. In the meantime, diversified energy companies like Exxon Mobil are investing heavily in technology, a necessity if they are to flourish.It\u2019s clear even to energy companies, in other words, that tech\u2019s abiding power in the marketplace is not temporary. Technology permeates every sector of the economy, even those not formally classified as high-tech. Whether companies like Amazon and Johnson & Johnson should carry tech labels is beside the point. Tech has already taken over.These days every company is a tech company, but some have better niches, faster growth, more attractive offerings or more favorable share prices than others. These kinds of fundamental distinctions will influence the Top 10 rankings of the future.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Our Country as Good as Our Athletes Are?", "Date": "2016-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPessimism has flavored this election campaign. America is in decline. The country is on the wrong track. We\u2019re getting our clocks cleaned in global trade deals. We\u2019re still suffering from the humiliation of Iraq.The share of Americans who say that democracy is a \u201cfairly bad\u201d or \u201cvery bad\u201d system of government is rising sharply. A quarter of young Americans feel that way, according to data drawn from the World Values Survey. A majority of young Americans believe that the United States should stay out of world affairs, according to a Chicago Council on Global Affairs report.Yet when you watch the Olympics, we don\u2019t seem like some sad-sack country in terminal decline. If anything, the coverage gets a little boring because we\u2019re always winning! And the winners have such amazingly American stories and personality types (Biles, Ledecky, and, yes, Lochte).American Olympic performance has been astoundingly consistent over the recent decades. With rare exception, we can be counted on to win between 101 and 110 medals Olympiad after Olympiad. The 2016 team seems on pace to win at least that many.We\u2019re not great when measured by medals per capita (New Zealand, Denmark, Hungary, Australia and Britain are the big winners there), but America does have more medals than any other nation in history, and that lead is widening.Moreover, America doesn\u2019t win because we have better athletes (talent must be distributed equally). America does well because it has such great systems for preparing athletes. Medals are won by institutions as much as by individuals. The Germans have a great system for training kayakers, equestrians and throwers \u2014 the discus or javelin. The U.S. has amazing institutions to prepare jumpers, swimmers, basketball players, gymnasts, runners and decathletes.The big question is: Is the greatness of America\u2019s sports institutions reflective of the country\u2019s strong institutions generally, or is it more like the Soviet Union\u2019s sports greatness, a Potemkin show masking national rot?Well, if you step outside the pall of the angry campaign rhetoric, you see that America\u2019s institutions are generally quite strong. Over the past decades, some developing countries, like Brazil, India and China, posted glitzy economic growth numbers. But those countries are now all being hampered by institutional weakness and growth is plummeting.But America\u2019s economic success is like our Olympic success, writ large. The nation\u2019s troubles are evident, but our country has sound fundamentals. The American dollar is by far the world\u2019s currency. The Food and Drug Administration is the benchmark for medical standards. The American patent system is the most important in the world.Nine of Forbes\u2019s 10 most valuable brands are American (Apple, Google, IBM and so on). The U.S. is the leading energy producer. We have 15 (at least!) of the world\u2019s top 20 universities, while Hollywood is as dominant as ever.America is also quite good at change. The median age in the U.S. is 37.8, compared with 46.5 for both Germany and Japan. The newer a technology is the more the U.S. is likely to dominate it \u2014 whether it\u2019s the cloud or the sharing economy. According to The Economist, 91 percent of online searches are done through American companies\u2019 services, and 99 percent of smartphones run on American-made operating systems.Some American industries have declined, but others are rising. American fund managers handle 55 percent of the world\u2019s assets. American businesses host 61 percent of the world\u2019s social media users.On the campaign circuit, global trade is portrayed as this great national disaster. We\u2019re being destroyed by foreigners! The Trans-Pacific Partnership was the central dominating boogeyman at the Democratic National Convention, especially among people who have no clue what\u2019s in it.In fact, America succeeds in global trade about as well as at the Olympics. We rank third, behind Switzerland and Singapore, in global competitive rankings put out by the World Economic Forum. When trade is leveled by international agreements, American firms take advantage and win customers.Over the past five years, Zoellick wrote, the U.S. has run a $320 billion trade surplus in manufactured goods with its free-trade partners. The country\u2019s farmers and ranchers boosted exports to free-trade partners by 130 percent between 2003 and 2013.In one important way sports is not like economics. In Rio there are only three medals in each event. Global trade is not zero-sum. It spreads vast benefits across societies, while undeniably hurting some businesses in narrow fields along the way.Of course, we have to take care of those who are hurt, but the biggest threat now is unmerited pessimism itself, and the stupid and fearful choices that inevitably flow from it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dinner, Disrupted", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 At a fancy Silicon Valley restaurant where the micro-greens came from a farm called Love Apple, I got a definitive taste of California in the age of the plutocrats. This state \u2014 and this native of it \u2014 have long indulged a borderline-comic impulse toward self-expression through lifestyle and food, as if success might be a matter of nailing the perfect combination of surf trunks, grilled lamb hearts and sunset views.For baby boomers who moved to the Bay Area in search of the unfussy good life, in the late 20th century, it was all about squinting just right to make our dry coastal hills look like Provence \u2014 per the instructions of the Francophile chefs Jeremiah Tower and Alice Waters of the legendary Berkeley restaurant Chez Panisse.By the early 2000s, that Eurocentric baby-boomer cuisine enjoyed a prosperous middle age as \u201cmarket-driven Cal/French/Italian\u201d with an implicit lifestyle fantasy involving an Italianate Sonoma home with goats, a cheese-making barn, vineyards and olive trees, and a code of organic-grass-fed ethics that mapped a reliable boundary between food fit for bourgeois progressives and unclean commodity meats.By this point, I was a food writer of the not-anonymous variety, by which I mean that I joined the search for the next big thing by eating great meals courtesy of magazines and restaurants, without hiding my identity the way a critic would. In 2010, a magazine asked me to profile the extraordinary chef David Kinch of the aforementioned fancy restaurant, which is called Manresa and lies in the affluent suburb of Los Gatos.I went there twice for work and concentrated both times on the food alone. I was knocked out, especially by a creation called Tidal Pool, which involved a clear littoral broth of seaweed dashi pooling around sea-urchin tongues, pickled kelp and foie gras. I know that I will set off the gag reflex in certain quarters when I confess that, in my view, Mr. Kinch took the sensory pleasure of falling off a surfboard into cold Northern California water and transformed it into the world\u2019s most delicious bowl of Japanese-French seafood soup. Mr. Kinch, I concluded, was the savior sent to bring California cuisine into the 21st century.The meal lasted five hours, consisted of more than 20 fantastic courses, and we all felt that we had eaten perhaps the greatest meal of our lives. Then the bill came: $1,200, with tax and tip. It turned out that \u201ca special tasting menu\u201d was a price point marked on the menu. My editor friend confessed that he could charge only $400 to his corporate card, and I felt sick with self-loathing. I knew this was my fault \u2014 not Mr. Kinch\u2019s \u2014 and I looked around the dining room at loving couples, buoyant double dates, even a family with two young children for whom a thousand-dollar meal was no stretch. I had been a fool in more ways than I could count, including my delusion that one could think and talk about food outside of its social and economic context.Like any artisan whose trade depends upon expensive materials and endless work, every chef who plays that elite-level game must cultivate patrons. That means surrounding food with a choreographed theater of luxury in which every course requires a skilled server to set down fresh cutlery and then return with clean wine glasses. A midcareer professional sommelier then must fill those wine glasses and deliver a learned lecture about that next wine\u2019s origin and flavor. Another person on a full-time salary with benefits must then set down art-piece ceramic plates that are perfectly selected to flatter the next two-mouthful course. Yet another midcareer professional must then explain the rare and expensive plants and proteins that have been combined through hours of time-consuming techniques to create the next exquisitely dense compression of value that each diner will devour in moments. Those empty plates and glasses must then be cleared to repeat this cycle again and again, hour after hour.In the case of Northern California, these restaurants must satisfy a venture-capital and post-I.P.O. crowd for whom a $400 dinner does not qualify as conspicuous consumption and for whom the prevailing California-lifestyle fantasy is less about heirloom tomatoes than recognizing inefficiencies in the international medical technology markets, flying first-class around the planet to cut deals at three-Michelin-Star restaurants in Hong Kong or London and then, back home, treating the kids to casual $2,000 Sunday suppers.The foragers and farmers and fishermen of the old Chez Panisse fantasy still figure, but now as an unseen impecunious peasant horde combing beaches and redwoods for the chanterelles and Santa Barbara spot prawns that genius chefs transform into visionary distillations of a mythical Northern California experience that no successful entrepreneur would waste time living.In a normal metropolitan area, super-upscale places like Manresa have such narrow profit margins that ambitious young chefs open them mostly to establish their reputations; later, to pay the mortgage, they open a profitable mid-range joint nearby. According to Mr. Patterson, the opposite is now true in tech-boom San Francisco.\u201cBusy high-end places are doing fine because they have more ways to control their costs, but the mid-level is getting killed,\u201d Mr. Patterson told me. \u201cI\u2019ve heard guys say they\u2019re doing eight million a year in sales and bringing home less than 2 percent as profit.\u201d As a result, high-end places are proliferating. A partial list would include Coi, Benu, Atelier Crenn, Mosu and Saison, at which dinner for one runs $641 all-in. (Manresa is now comparable.)Meanwhile, those so-called midlevel restaurants \u2014 by which I mean restaurants that cater to the merely loaded \u2014 exhibit all the innovative exuberance and anxiety of the tech-employee class for whom money would be abundant if not for the cost of local living. On the upside, that cohort\u2019s meritocratic multiculturalism, its \u201cyou do you\u201d faith that anybody might have a million-dollar idea, has encouraged an inclusive culinary scene that supports fantastic upscale Mexican places like Cala and Californios, countless soothingly hip Japanese restaurants like Izakaya Rintaro, intensely flavored street-market Thai at Hawker Fare and what has to be the planet\u2019s most interesting upscale Hawaiian comfort food at Liholiho Yacht Club. Nobody calls any of these restaurants \u201cethnic,\u201d and taken together, they give San Francisco dining the most cosmopolitan feel it has ever had.On the downside, in a perfect parallel to the tech sector, the San Francisco restaurant industry has the worst racial and ethnic pay gap in the United States, and the average cook\u2019s salary of about $53,000 doesn\u2019t nearly cover the $3,490 average rent for a one-bedroom apartment. In San Francisco, where public transportation shuts down at midnight and barely reaches the satellite cities that are going through their own real-estate booms, it is essentially impossible for cooks to work downtown and live anywhere reasonably close. As a result, restaurant owners talk about creating dormitory-style housing for employees. Others say that five years ago, when they listed a job opening, they got 50 qualified applicants; now they get five or six.I am all in favor of San Francisco\u2019s $13 per hour minimum wage (which rises to $15 by 2018), plus mandatory paid sick leave, parental leave and employer health care contributions. But labor costs at restaurants are inching past 50 percent of total expenditures, an indicator of poor fiscal health. Commercial rents have also gone bananas. Add the ever-rising cost of fris\u00e9e and pastured quail eggs and it\u2019s no wonder that many restaurants are experimenting with that unique form of sadism known as \u201csmall plate sharing,\u201d which amounts to offering a big group of hungry people something tiny to divvy up. Even nontrendy joints now ask $30 for a proper entree \u2014 a price point, according to Mr. Patterson, that encourages even affluent customers to discover the joys of home cooking.THIS is all fine at the handful of places that are full and profitable every night \u2014 State Bird Provisions, Lazy Bear \u2014 but, according to Gwyneth Borden of the Golden Gate Restaurant Association, an alarming number are not. The bigger tech companies worsen the problem by scooping up culinary talent to run lavish free food programs that, as Ms. Borden said, offer workers \u201call-day bacon and lobster rolls and tacos.\u201d This kills the incentive for employees to spend a penny in restaurants, especially at lunch. (Ms. Borden also told me that she can\u2019t count the number of times she has heard an Uber or Lyft driver confess to being a former chef.)Constant traffic jams and great restaurants in less congested cities like Oakland discourage suburbanites who used to cross the Bay Bridge for date night in San Francisco. Besides, as Mr. Patterson says, the city clears out on holiday weekends. \u201cThey all go to Tahoe,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to get a reservation somewhere? Just book a table during Burning Man.\u201dThe tech-boom economy also infects everyone inside and outside of it with both dreams of striking it rich and fears of getting priced out of town. That\u2019s why chefs don\u2019t just open that one restaurant they\u2019ve always dreamed about. They invent catchy new restaurant \u201cconcepts\u201d and borrow mountains of money to create dining rooms that end up with no human touch and food that looks remarkably similar to Instagram photographs of dishes created by trendsetters like Mr. Kinch and Mr. Patterson.\u201cThe concern,\u201d Ms. Borden told me, \u201cis that when the economy slows, who is going to survive? We\u2019re already seeing quicker openings and closings because restaurants open with so much debt\u201d \u2014 hundreds of thousands to a million dollars or more, from construction and months of astronomical rent before anyone sells a single $17 grilled-octopus appetizer \u2014 \u201cthat if you\u2019re not full from Day 1, it\u2019s really hard to stay open.\u201dThe net effect is an ever-more frantic pursuit of eye-catching innovation and, as everyone trades in whispers about a cooling venture-capital market, a mounting fear that a restaurant apocalypse is nigh. As Mr. Patterson explained, \u201cThe food has never been better and the business climate has never been worse and so we are speeding toward a cliff.\u201dOne delicious irony, for Californians of a certain age, is the inversion of an old joke about Northern Californians hating the superficial glitz of Los Angeles and Los Angelenos never thinking much about Northern California. This made sense for the mid-to-late 20th century, when the entertainment and defense industries secured Southern California\u2019s place at the center of West Coast economic power. Now Los Angeles is where San Franciscans move when they can\u2019t afford Oakland. Every young artist and musician I meet in San Francisco tells me that he or she wants to move south for cheap rent and a better creative scene.Sang Yoon, the chef and owner of Lukshon in Culver City, sees it as a difference between hyper-glorification of the chef and the farm in Northern California and, in Los Angeles, celebration of middle-class immigrant culture. \u201cHalf the restaurants I go to, I don\u2019t know who the chef is! It\u2019s not so personality-driven,\u201d he said. \u201cIn L.A., we can celebrate a cuisine and not rouge it up.\u201dMr. Choi explained it to me like this: \u201cAll these mom-and-pop restaurants that really are California cuisine and that have been here for 30 years cooking for their own community are now filled with patrons they\u2019ve never seen before because of social media and instead of becoming angry or skeptical, they\u2019ve embraced it \u2014 that\u2019s the soul of a cook, you never discriminate against the people eating your food nor do you judge them, you are so happy they have arrived. And their food is getting even better.\u201dIn yet another sweet twist, the pop-cultural reach of Mr. Choi and Mr. Gold has Los Angelenos teaching San Franciscans left out of the gold rush how to find fellow travelers. Last week, my friend Wen Shen recommended an affordable Vietnamese place called Yummy Yummy in the unpretentious Inner Sunset neighborhood. A wall-mounted video monitor played scenes of daily life in Vietnam, where I have never been. I felt as if I had come home, mostly because, race and ethnicity aside, Yummy Yummy\u2019s clientele appeared to be blessedly middle class. I also liked it when our waiter saw me fumbling with a rice-paper wrap for the lemongrass shrimp and said, in the most common of California languages, that I should roll it up \u201cjust like a burrito.\u201dAdvertisement"}

More than $700 million in new retail, office and residential space is under construction or about to start in the district, according to the River City Company, an economic development nonprofit organization.Tiffanie Robinson, 31, the president of Lamp Post Properties, said the market for the co-living project is young entrepreneurs who can spend time in Chattanooga to see if it suits them.\u201cThere is a really big need for smart real estate investment within the innovation district,\u201d Ms. Robinson said. \u201cThe point is to create density for start-ups and technology companies in our community. We want to show how real estate can mold a city and mold next-generation companies.\u201dA few blocks away, Lamp Post is renovating the Mayfield Annex, a 28,000-square-foot, 109-year-old building that was once an Elks lodge and offices for Hamilton County. It is being turned into a $3.2 million office building for new-media companies and is scheduled to open next spring.Another of Lamp Post\u2019s downtown projects is converting the 45,000-square-foot Newton Chevrolet dealership, which operated for 68 years before closing in 2007. It will become a distillery for Tennessee Stillhouse, the maker of Chattanooga Whiskey. The $6 million project is scheduled to open in March.Almost a dozen other residential, retail and office projects are under construction, many of them designed for the high-tech business market or to coax young tech entrepreneurs to live and work downtown.AMCA, a Virginia developer, is spending $31 million to renovate the 10-story Chattanooga Bank and Trust building on Broad Street. The 89-year-old building will be turned into a 162-room Aloft Hotel with two ground-floor restaurants.On the other side of Broad Street, Heritage Land and Development, a Memphis company, is renovating the 92-year-old Maclellan Building. The 100,000-square-foot space once housed an insurer and has been empty for 11 years. It will be converted into 90 apartment units for $13.5 million.Many of Chattanooga\u2019s city leaders and business development executives anticipated the growing popularity of the downtown area. In the late 1960s, the newly formed Environmental Protection Agency declared Chattanooga the most polluted city in the nation. Three decades of investment cleared pollutants from the Tennessee River and the air, replaced old riverfront plants with parks and trails, strengthened the 11,000-student University of Tennessee at Chattanooga campus and constructed attractions, like a freshwater aquarium that opened in 1992.Chattanooga started to market itself to young entrepreneurs and attracted some well-known brands. For instance, the online reservation service OpenTable bought Quickcue, a local workflow app developer, for $11.5 million in 2013. OpenTable, based in San Francisco, also opened a Chattanooga office in a newly renovated innovation district building at Cherry and Seventh Streets.\u201cI can\u2019t think of another place that has made this kind of infrastructure investment to promote job growth and real estate development,\u201d said R. Byron Carlock Jr., the national real estate practice leader for PricewaterhouseCoopers. \u201cTypically, it\u2019s creating venture capital or grant funds.\u201d\u201cBoth the broadband and the smart grid infrastructure were built out ahead of schedule,\u201d Mr. Lobo said in an email. \u201cThe fiber investment in Hamilton County appears to deliver benefits at a faster pace than previously predicted.\u201dJust as rail links galvanized 19th-century communities and interstate highways spurred 20th-century development, Chattanooga\u2019s fast broadband network changed the city\u2019s view of itself and encouraged new development.Fletcher Bright, who has developed property in Chattanooga since 1953, said the city was experiencing a stronger surge in downtown construction than at any other time in his career.\u201cAll of a sudden, people want to be downtown,\u201d said Mr. Bright, the chairman of the Fletcher Bright Company. \u201cThat was unheard-of just a few years ago.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Rules Require Heavy-Duty Trucks to Reduce Emissions by 25% Over the Next Decade", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Obama administration on Tuesday issued aggressive new emissions standards for heavy-duty trucks. The rules are expected to achieve better fuel efficiency and a bigger cut in pollution than the version that was first proposed last year.Officials said the new standards would require up to a 25 percent reduction in carbon emissions for big tractor-trailers over the next 10 years, and somewhat smaller improvements for delivery trucks, school buses and other large vehicles.The carbon-reduction target is 10 percent more than when the rules were proposed last year, and was made tougher after a public comment period.\u201cWe are way out ahead of any other country,\u201d said Gina McCarthy, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said the trucking industry would save an estimated $170 billion in fuel costs through 2027 and reduce petroleum consumption by two billion barrels over the lifetime of the vehicles sold under the new rules.\u201cWe are at a pivotal point in our fight against climate change and its catastrophic consequences,\u201d Mr. Foxx said in conference call announcing the new standards.Currently, heavy trucks average about six miles per gallon. While there was no specific target released for industrywide fuel economy, the standards call for significant reductions in emissions beyond the first phase of rules that were enacted in 2014.Ms. McCarthy said the standards were \u201cambitious but achievable,\u201d and were decided after hundreds of meetings in the last year with groups representing truck manufacturers, fleet owners and environmental organizations. \u201cThere were technological advances that were available to us,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was data and it was facts.\u201dThe rules are intended to improve fuel economy and reduce emissions from tractor-trailers and other large vehicles that transport steel, cars, oil and a wide array of consumer products. It will be up to engine and truck-tractor makers to determine how to meet them.Analysts have estimated the cost of complying with the new standards at $12,000 a vehicle. Mr. Foxx said those investments would be outweighed by larger economic gains such as reduced fuel consumption.\u201cThis is going to be a huge economic opportunity for those who are in the trucking industry,\u201d he said.The American Trucking Associations, the road-cargo industry\u2019s largest trade group, said it was cautiously optimistic that the new standards could be met without causing disruption to vehicle manufacturers and corporate fleets.\u201cWhile the potential for real cost savings and environmental benefits under this rule are there, the fleets will ultimately determine the success or failure of this rule based on their comfort level purchasing the new technologies,\u201d said Glen Kedzie, an association official.Heavy-duty trucks are the fastest-growing segment of the American transportation sector in terms of fossil-fuel consumption and account for about 20 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, despite making up only 5 percent of the vehicles on the road.The Obama administration has already mandated big increases in fuel economy for passenger cars and trucks. The government recently affirmed its target of 54.5 miles per gallon as a fleetwide average by 2025.But the new rules on heavy-truck emissions are another critical factor in the government\u2019s overall effort to meet goals set in the international climate accord in Paris in December.The Heavy-Duty Fuel Efficiency Leadership Group, an alliance of engine manufacturers and large fleet operators, generally supported the direction of the new rules and the government\u2019s support of fuel-efficient technology.Regulators said that tractor-trailer owners could recoup the cost of new technology on their vehicles within two years because of fuel savings. Other vehicles may take longer to generate enough savings to cover the cost of improved engines and other equipment.One member of the alliance, the soft-drink giant PepsiCo, said the standards would help spur more innovation in an industry that was already pushing to lower its fuel costs.\u201cThe steps we have taken to boost efficiency of our fleet across PepsiCo have significantly reduced emissions while lowering our operating costs,\u201d said Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo\u2019s chief executive. \u201cAnd we are committed to doing much more.\u201dCutting the cost of fuel used in hauling goods could reduce prices paid by consumers. According to the Consumer Federation of America, the average American family spends more than $1,000 a year on fuel costs in the trucking sector.\u201cThis is a key consumer issue,\u201d said Mark Cooper, the federation\u2019s research director. \u201cThe freight industry is dripping with potential to increase their miles per gallon, and the performance standards are an effective way to realize that potential.\u201dSome environmental groups hailed the announcement of the new regulations and predicted they would result in significant improvements in air quality.\u201cThese emissions reductions will benefit, literally, every community across the nation,\u201d said S. William Becker, executive director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies.But some other environmental groups suggested that the government could have set the standards even higher.\u201cOur research shows that they could have gone further by requiring trucks to be at least 40 percent more efficient,\u201d said David Cooke, a senior vehicles analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists.Mr. Cooke said the onus is now on truck manufacturers to take full advantage of fuel-saving technology that is currently available. \u201cThey need to put proven technologies to work while continue to move the industry forward,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Does Airbnb Enable Racism?", "Date": "2016-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWashington \u2014 While planning a trip to Buenos Aires two years ago, I decided to give Airbnb a try. The idea of renting a private apartment through the online service instead of paying for a generic hotel room was intriguing. Though August marks the off-season for tourism in Buenos Aires, I was rejected by the first three hosts I contacted. One host listed the days in question as available but nonetheless claimed my request overlapped with another reservation; another declined without explanation; and a third got back to me after a long delay, claiming to have missed my request.While my fourth request was accepted, the overall experience was a sour one. I am African-American, and because Airbnb strongly recommends display of a profile picture (which I provided) and requires its users to display an actual name, it was hard to believe that race didn\u2019t come into play.That stay marked my last booking through Airbnb.How can the problem be addressed? Although many of our nation\u2019s federal civil rights statutes were adopted before lawmakers could envision an online-based sharing economy, these laws were clearly intended to prohibit the kind of racial discrimination now experienced by many on Airbnb. At the same time, whether such companies are subject to public accommodations laws and fair housing requirements is not a straightforward matter.Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits racial discrimination in public accommodations like hotels and restaurants. The law contains an exemption, however, for small owner-occupied rooming houses, a category that may seem to include most Airbnb hosts. But what if we view Airbnb as one giant hotel? Given that Airbnb\u2019s business competes directly with services provided by hotels, it seems appropriate to treat its rentals as public accommodations under the law.The Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination in housing rentals and sales, applies not just to landlords and housing providers but also to brokers. By serving as an intermediary between renters and hosts, Airbnb could be viewed as brokering rental opportunities and thereby subject to the law. But again, the matter is not settled.Another civil rights statute, 42 U.S.C. 1981, which was enacted in the wake of the Civil War, prohibits racial discrimination in contracting. Although Airbnb could be viewed as aiding and abetting a violation of this law when a host rejects someone on the basis of race, the law requires proof of discriminatory intent. In most cases involving Airbnb, that kind of proof could be difficult to uncover.Of course, Airbnb can voluntarily bring an end to this discrimination and drastically reduce the role that bias plays in its marketplace. This summer, Airbnb hired the former United States attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr. as an adviser to help the company shape a new anti-discrimination policy. I have three suggestions to ensure that any such policy is meaningful:First, Airbnb should actively audit hosts who are suspected of discrimination. By having users whose only perceived difference is their race attempt to make reservations with the same hosts (much like in the Harvard study), the company can identify those who discriminate.Second, Airbnb should permanently bar hosts who discriminate.Third, Airbnb should stop having users display an actual name or profile picture before booking; that information should be withheld until a reservation has been confirmed. (Airbnb has a feature called Instant Book, which does not give hosts the discretion to reject guests for available dates; by making that feature mandatory, the company could limit the influence of names and pictures.)Unfortunately, Airbnb has not always sent the right message about how it plans to handle this issue. In a class-action lawsuit pending against the site, the company has invoked mandatory arbitration provisions buried in the terms of service that users must agree to in order to use the site. These provisions limit access to the courts for potential victims of discrimination; Airbnb should not attempt to force such people into arbitration.Only by allowing potential victims of discrimination their day in court and taking swift and comprehensive action to root out bias among its hosts can Airbnb fulfill its promise of being a truly inclusive online rental marketplace. If Airbnb fails to fix the problem on its own, litigation or congressional action may be required to provide greater clarity about the scope of anti-discrimination laws.Until then, I and many other minority consumers will appreciate the certainty regarding our rights that comes with an old-fashioned hotel reservation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Voters in Thailand Endorse Military\u2019s Proposed Constitution", "Date": "2016-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBANGKOK \u2014 In its first test at the polls, Thailand\u2019s military government won overwhelming approval Sunday of a new Constitution that aims to reduce the power of political parties and extend the influence of the military.With 94 percent of the ballots counted, voters were approving the military\u2019s proposed Constitution by a wide margin, according to returns issued by the election commission. A companion ballot measure that would give the military junta the authority to fill the Senate with its appointees was also easily winning approval.The gap was wide enough that the results would not change, Somchai Srisutthiyakorn, an election official, said on television.Meechai Ruchupan, the chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee, said his panel would begin writing laws required to put the new Constitution into effect as soon as the results were official.\u201cOur country has been wounded for a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom now on, everyone in the country will join hands and move the country forward under the new rules that we approved.\u201dThe Constitution would be the country\u2019s 20th in 84 years. Election officials put the turnout at 54.6 percent of eligible voters.The junta seized power in 2014 and brought temporary peace after years of clashes between political factions. The military leaders have pledged to hold parliamentary elections next year and return power to civilian leaders no matter what the outcome of the voting on Sunday.Human rights groups challenged the legitimacy of the referendum because of restrictions that prevented opponents of the proposed Constitution from campaigning.Thailand\u2019s strict l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 laws make it a crime to insult the monarchy, an offense that includes a surprising number of activities.The junta limited public assemblies and threatened long prison terms for people who spread information that it deemed false. More than 120 people were arrested for violating campaign rules in the weeks leading up to the referendum, according to Human Rights Watch.Thailand has long been divided between the rural poor, mainly in the northern and northeastern parts of the country, and the urban middle class, leading to years of protests and of clashes between the two factions.Two populist prime ministers, Thaksin Shinawatra and his sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, were elected with the support of rural, northern voters. But Mr. Thaksin was ousted by a military coup in 2006, and Ms. Yingluck was ousted by a court ruling just before the 2014 coup.Opponents have long accused both siblings of being corrupt. Mr. Thaksin, who lives in self-imposed exile, was convicted in absentia in 2008 of violating conflict-of-interest rules in a land deal. Ms. Yingluck is on trial on charges of criminal negligence in managing government rice subsidies for poor farmers.Adding to Thailand\u2019s precarious political situation has been the lingering illness of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, 88, who has been hospitalized for more than a year. Analysts say the military sees its role as ensuring stability as the country prepares for the expected succession of Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn.Thailand has experienced a repeated cycle of elections, coups and new Constitutions since the absolute monarchy was abolished in 1932.The proposed Constitution was designed to shift the balance of power away from major political parties and give a greater voice to medium-size parties under a new formula for awarding seats in Parliament. Experts say the system was designed so no single party would have control and so the country would be ruled by a coalition of political parties.\u201cThe politics from now will be more compromising, more negotiating,\u201d Yuthaporn Issarachai, the dean of political science at Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University, said in a television interview. \u201cIt won\u2019t be politics ruled by the majority. So we will expect to see some adjustments from the political parties. We may see the switching of sides and some negotiations.\u201dApproval of the second measure on the ballot would give the junta the power to appoint the 250 members of the Senate to five-year terms and give the senators a role in selecting the prime minister, which previously was left to the House of Representatives.\u201cIt will lead to a new political system that we\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d said Kamnoon Sittisamarn, a former senator and a member of the junta\u2019s advisory National Reform Steering Assembly. \u201cIt was designed to make the country move forward for a change and not return to crisis.\u201dThe biggest loser under the new system will most likely be Ms. Yingluck\u2019s Pheu Thai party.Sodsri Satayathum, a former election commissioner, questioned how effective a coalition government could be.\u201cIn the upcoming election, there won\u2019t be a single party that wins the majority,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cThe government will find it hard to run the country.\u201dSiripan Nogsuan Sawasdee, a political science professor at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, said the election results were contrary to the push toward democracy in Western society.\u201cThis is a reflection of the mistrust of politicians,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very deep-rooted.\u201dIn Bangkok, Sunee Nateethong, 50, a businesswoman, said she voted for the junta\u2019s proposals because she favored a continuing role by the military to reduce corruption and maintain stability.\u201cIt is better than politicians running the country,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have the military babysitting the government for the next five years.\u201dSikarin Kanoksikarin, 44, who works for a United States food producer, said it was better for the country to have the military restore democracy gradually, as the new Constitution would.\u201cTo change the political system takes time,\u201d he said.But people who voted against the junta\u2019s proposals said they were dissatisfied with its management of the economy and were tired of the military taking power.\u201cI don\u2019t like dictatorship,\u201d said Putiporn Sa-ngangam, 21, an accountant. \u201cThis is our country\u2019s cycle. We have an election and a coup over and over again. I think the previous Constitution was good.\u201dPaparat Yurod, 46, who comes from northeastern Thailand but works in a Bangkok laundry, said voters should be able to decide for themselves who runs the country, without military interference.\u201cWe are hoping to get democracy soon,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if we have a bad government, we will have another election and can decide if they continue in power.\u201dPoypiti Amatatham contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Illegal in Massachusetts: Asking Your Salary in a Job Interview", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a groundbreaking effort to close the wage gap between men and women, Massachusetts has become the first state to bar employers from asking about applicants\u2019 salaries before offering them a job.The bipartisan legislation, signed into law on Monday by Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, is being pushed as a model for other states, as the issue of men historically outearning women who do the same job has leapt onto the national political scene.Nationally, there have been repeated efforts to strengthen equal pay laws \u2014 which are already on the books but tend to lack teeth \u2014 but none have succeeded so far. Hillary Clinton has tried to make equal pay a signature issue of her campaign, while Donald J. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka praised her father for his actions on this issue when she spoke at the Republican National Convention.By barring companies from asking prospective employees how much they earned at their last jobs, Massachusetts will ensure that the historically lower wages and salaries assigned to women and minorities do not follow them for their entire careers. Companies tend to set salaries for new hires using their previous pay as a base line.Federal law already prohibits gender-based pay discrimination, but violations are hard to prove and wage gaps persist in nearly every industry.Nationally, women are paid 79 cents for every dollar that men earn, according to the United States Census Bureau. A number of factors affect that statistic, including the career fields women choose, but economists consistently find evidence of pay disparities not offset by other variables.And the law will require equal pay not just for workers whose jobs are alike, but also for those whose work is of \u201ccomparable character\u201d or who work in \u201ccomparable operations.\u201d Workers with more seniority will still be permitted to earn higher pay, but the law effectively broadens the definition of what is equal work.And Massachusetts joins at least 12 other states that already require companies to let employees compare notes about how much they are paid.The distinguishing feature in the Massachusetts law is that job seekers will no longer be compelled to disclose their salary or wages at their current or previous jobs \u2014 which often leaves applicants with the nagging suspicion that they might have been offered more money if the earlier figure had been higher. People will still be allowed to volunteer their salary information.But proponents of equal pay laws say that attitudes are shifting among businesses. In Massachusetts, for instance, the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce was an early and enthusiastic backer.\u201cThat really set the tone,\u201d said State Representative Ellen Story, a Democrat and co-sponsor of the bill. \u201cNow it wasn\u2019t just members of the women\u2019s caucus, it was business leaders, too, asking for this.\u201dThe Massachusetts attorney general will be in charge of enforcing the law, which also gives workers the right to sue companies directly for violations.Just as important, according to advocates of equal pay, are the changing demographics in boardrooms and statehouses.Ms. Jehlen, one of the Massachusetts bill\u2019s co-sponsors, recalled the first time she testified about equal pay issues before the legislature\u2019s labor committee: All the members were men.She and others had taken up the cause on behalf of a group of female cafeteria workers who filed a lawsuit in 1991 seeking parity with male janitors, who did comparable work, the cafeteria workers said, but were paid significantly more. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled against the women, saying that the state\u2019s equal pay law was not clear in its definition of comparable work.This week, one of those cafeteria workers attended the ceremony at which Governor Baker signed the new law.\u201cFor me,\u201d Ms. Jehlen said, \u201cthat was the most emotionally powerful thing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Middle-Income Jobs Finally Show Signs of a Rebound", "Date": "2016-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe American economy is finally creating more middle-income jobs, according to a new analysis released Thursday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in a turnabout from the feast-and-famine pattern earlier in the recovery, when hiring was strongest at the bottom and top of the wage scale.The findings suggest that it may soon be time to retire a familiar criticism of the long but lackluster economic rebound that has been underway since the end of the Great Recession in 2009: the hollowing out of the American middle class.Between 2013 and 2015, employers added nearly 2.3 million workers earning from $30,000 to $60,000 a year, primarily in fields like education, construction, transportation and social services. That was roughly 50 percent more than in either the high-wage or low-wage categories during the same period.By contrast, the Fed researchers found, of the nearly 7.6 million jobs created from 2010 to 2013, only about a fifth fell into the middle-tier category, with the largest number instead coming from lower-paid sectors like food preparation and health care support.\u201cThe tide has begun to turn,\u201d said William C. Dudley, president of the New York Fed. \u201cFor the first time in quite a while, we are seeing gains in middle-wage jobs actually outnumber gains in higher- and lower-wage jobs nationwide.\u201dAlthough the economy has created nearly 15 million jobs since employment bottomed out in early 2010, the gains in the recovery have been noticeably uneven. While many cities along the East and West Coasts have been prolific job creators, parts of the Midwest and South have not experienced similar improvements.At the same time, most American workers have made only paltry wage gains until recently, despite steady hiring that has helped bring the national unemployment rate down to 4.9 percent last month from a high of 10 percent in late 2009.\u201cIt\u2019s important, but we are coming off of a really low threshold,\u201d said Diane Swonk, a veteran independent economist based in Chicago, referring to the new Fed study. \u201cWe\u2019ve shifted gears, but we\u2019re only now beginning to regain the quality in terms of jobs.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve got a long way to go,\u201d Ms. Swonk added, noting that after inflation, family incomes were still below where they were in 2000. \u201cIt\u2019s more than a lost decade.\u201dThe nascent national improvement identified by the Fed researchers in New York also held true in the metropolitan region in recent years, with New York City and surrounding suburbs adding 179,000 middle-wage jobs from 2013 to 2015, compared with just 18,000 from 2010 to 2013.The shift coincided with the passing of the baton from finance to technology as the major driver in local job creation.More than any area in the United States, with the possible exception of San Francisco, New York City has come to symbolize an economy built on vast gains for a lucky few, with most everyone else largely standing still.But as the motor of New York\u2019s economy, Wall Street is yielding to Silicon Alley and Brooklyn, as technology companies like Google and smaller start-ups bulk up while banks and hedge funds slim down.Since 2010, tech employment in New York City has jumped by 53,000, while securities industry jobs have increased by just 12,000.In fact, with 172,400 workers in 2015, employment in the New York securities industry remains well short of where it peaked before the financial crisis. There were more than 125,000 tech workers in New York City last year, nearly double the total a decade ago.\u201cIn the past, the city has counted on job growth from Wall Street to fuel economic growth during recoveries and expansions,\u201d Mr. Dudley said. \u201cThis time around, however, job gains in the securities industry have been quite meager.\u201dHiring in fields like internet publishing, online shopping and scientific research and development, Mr. Dudley added, \u201cis picking up much of the slack created by the softness of the securities industry.\u201dThe local tech boom has also spread the largess well beyond the canyons of Wall Street. Private sector job growth in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx was stronger last year than it was in Manhattan.While technology companies are still mostly based in Manhattan, Brooklyn has benefited from what economists call a multiplier effect, as young tech workers move to the borough in search of more affordable housing and patronize restaurants, clubs and other services there.The South Bronx, once synonymous with urban decay, is also on an upswing, especially around the markets in the Hunts Point area, said Jason Bram, a researcher with the New York Fed. Queens has benefited from its proximity to local airports.Suburban counties like Rockland, Westchester and Nassau are also prospering again, and closer-in counties in New Jersey, like Bergen, Essex, Middlesex and Monmouth, are finally showing signs of life.Still, large parts of upstate New York, including Binghamton, Elmira and Syracuse, are struggling economically. Ithaca and Albany have been exceptions upstate, paced by gains in education and emerging fields like nanotechnology.There\u2019s plenty of need for further improvement, Mr. Dudley said, but he suggested that the increase in middle-class jobs since 2013 may mark a turning point in the recovery.\u201cThis is an important development in the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it were to continue, it would create more opportunities for workers and their families who have been struggling up to now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Warren Buffett Is Latest Billionaire to Excoriate Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOMAHA \u2014 The investor and philanthropist Warren Buffett unleashed a withering attack on Donald J. Trump on Monday for refusing to release his tax returns, asserting he had something to hide, and for misleading voters about his success as a businessman and ability to improve the American economy.Mr. Buffett, known to investors as the Sage of Omaha, said a monkey throwing darts at the stock pages in 1995, when Mr. Trump first offered stock in his Atlantic City hotels, would have come out far ahead of anyone who listened to Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201csiren song\u201d and invested in his company that lost money year over year.The attack from perhaps the nation\u2019s most revered investor undercut a core argument of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential candidacy: that his success as a businessman qualified him to run the country despite his lack of political experience.Mr. Buffett appeared at a rally with Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, in his hometown, Omaha. Taking on Mr. Trump, he pledged to personally transport 10 Nebraskans to the polls on Election Day on behalf of Mrs. Clinton and urged others to do the same.His appearance made him the latest billionaire to come out strongly against Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy \u2014 after speeches by Michael R. Bloomberg at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia and by Mark Cuban over the weekend \u2014 as Mrs. Clinton enlists their support to question Mr. Trump\u2019s business acumen.By campaigning in Nebraska, Mrs. Clinton was trying to pick up support in one of just two states that allocate electoral votes by congressional district.In 2008, Barack Obama won a single electoral vote in the state\u2019s Second District against Senator John McCain, though he lost it in 2012 in his more closely fought re-election race against Mitt Romney.In his address introducing Mrs. Clinton to the crowd, Mr. Buffett pointed out what most in the audience at a high school gym knew: that their votes could be disproportionately influential because of the state\u2019s peculiar Electoral College system.\u201cWe live in a very special place,\u201d Mr. Buffett said.Noting that Jonathan Karl of ABC News predicted on Sunday that the Electoral College could come down to a 269-to-269 tie, Mr. Buffett said, \u201cI am looking at the people that can change that 269 to 270.\u201dMr. Buffett said he, like Mr. Trump, had made a lot of money. \u201cI have not sacrificed,\u201d he told the rally.\u201cHow in the world can you stand up to a couple of parents who lost a son and talk about sacrificing because you were building a bunch of buildings?\u201dMr. Buffett quoted a famous rejoinder to Senator Joseph McCarthy during his 1950s anti-Communist hearings: \u201cHave you no sense of decency, sir?\u201dMr. Trump was campaigning on Monday in Ohio and Pennsylvania, two swing states that Mrs. Clinton visited over the weekend and where Mr. Trump is pushing his anti-trade message hard.Although Mr. Romney won all but one of Nebraska\u2019s 93 counties four years ago, the Clinton campaign sees opportunity this election cycle. The Second District sent a Democrat, Representative Brad Ashford, to Congress in 2014, and he was one of the rare members of his party to unseat an incumbent during a Republican wave.Maine is the only other state to split its electoral votes. In a reverse image of Nebraska, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign hopes to pick up a vote in more conservative, rural northern Maine.The Clinton campaign hired a Nebraska state director about a month ago, when it also started spending precious resources on TV ads in the state.\u201cThere\u2019s serious dollars and I would say serious politicos who have been hired,\u201d said Jane Kleeb, the incoming chairwoman of the Nebraska Democratic Party.At the Philadelphia convention, Ms. Kleeb helped mollify and motivate delegates supporting Senator Bernie Sanders, who carried the Nebraska caucuses during the primary race.More than 1,000 people snaked back and forth in a parking lot to hear Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Buffett. Among those awaiting the speakers was Jim Magill, a retired chief master sergeant in the Air Force. A Republican, he said he supported Mrs. Clinton and did not believe Mr. Trump\u2019s promises to veterans.He was appalled, he said, about the Republican nominee\u2019s criticism of the Khans.\u201cIt was deplorable somebody would say anything like that about a veteran who died for his country to his parents,\u201d Mr. Magill said. \u201cHe should have been slapped.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Brazil, Where Men\u2019s Soccer Once Was King, the Women\u2019s Game Rules", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySports of The TimesMANAUS, Brazil \u2014 Late Tuesday evening, as the Amazon temperature danced at 90 degrees with humidity in step, Janine van Wyk, a defender with South Africa\u2019s women\u2019s soccer team, paused just a second to take in the packed and throbbing Amaz\u00f4nia Arena, filled with 43,000 gloriously nuts fans.She thought to herself, \u201cThis is amazing, to realize that all these people are supporting the women\u2019s game,\u201d she told me later. \u201cThis lets younger girls everywhere know our sport is growing.\u201dShe flashed a quick smile even though her team had just been knocked out of the Olympic tournament.The wheels of change are turning in what Brazilians freely describe as their macho society. Their men\u2019s team collapsed in a heap in the World Cup two years ago and continues to play with a listlessness and diffidence in these Olympics. (Manauaras, the locals here, say the male players \u201care walking on high heels,\u201d which means, roughly and after consultation with eminent linguists, \u201carrogant snots.\u201d)The women\u2019s game \u2014 the Brazilian women in particular, but with applause left over for foreign teams as well \u2014 has captured the collective imagination here. As a colleague, Tania Franco, and I wandered around Manaus before the game, and later as we walked through the stands, the sense was that this nation\u2019s enraptured, besotted relationship with soccer had finally lapped over onto the women\u2019s side.Much of this is owed to the Brazilian women\u2019s players, who kick and run with an artful joie de vivre, offering ankle-breaking stutter steps and swashbuckling kicks. Marta, the ponytailed star long known as the Pel\u00e9 of the women\u2019s game, spent too much of her career as a soccer prophet without much honor in her own country. Now she hears loud applause every time her foot touches the ball.15 PhotosWe came upon Danyelle Christine da Silva Beleza, 14, standing and jumping and cheering in this stadium, which was built at fantastical cost and sits like a massive white orb astride northern Manaus. Her family and their neighbors\u2019 family had taken two cars and driven from Rond\u00f4nia to Manaus for this game. That sounds easy enough; a map shows mileage roughly equivalent to the seven-and-a-half-hour trip from New York City to Cleveland. Except that they traversed a \u201chighway\u201d that had been closed for 30 years and that remained a dirt track through the Amazon jungle. The two families bounced and jostled for 14 hours.No matter. They wanted to see the women play.\u201cBrazil is a macho-man society; it is wonderful this is changing,\u201d Danyelle said, beaming. \u201cI want Marta\u2019s jersey instead of Neymar\u2019s.\u201dAs it happened, the Brazilian women could not deliver a grand victory on Tuesday night. The South African women, by their own admission playing over their heads in the drive-a-stake-through-the-eye heat, held the Brazilians to a 0-0 tie.A similar fate befell the favored American women in their game here on Tuesday as the Colombian women, riding two brilliant free kicks by Catalina Usme, a striker with a ponytail Mohawk, tied the score at 2-2.Both games were accompanied by asterisks. The Brazilian and American teams were already assured of spots in the next round, and their coaches were not willing to watch key players melt into puddles in the Amazonian heat. So some key players sat; others played part of the game. Marta played only in the second half, and only because another player came up lame at halftime.\u201cI wanted to spare Marta this heat,\u201d the Brazilian coach, Vad\u00e3o, said. \u201cIf I got her hurt here. \u2026\u201dHe allowed that thought to trail off unspoken, no doubt figuring that had Marta gone down, he\u2019d have had to take up residency under an assumed name in a distant corner of the Amazon.The American coach, Jill Ellis, offered a wry, are-you-kidding look when asked if her players had slowed toward the end of their game. \u201cYeah, I would challenge anyone to run around in that heat,\u201d she said.Solo tried to backtrack. She began tweeting photos of the sunset over the Amazon. That fooled no one. She has been jeered since the Olympics began, and a boom of boos lowered on her every time she touched the ball on Tuesday. As she ran off the field at the half, she was washed over by chants of \u201cZika! Zika!\u201dChristiane Luizedo was one of those lustful booers. \u201cWe know that some people see Brazil as a third-world country,\u201d she said. \u201cShe has disrespected our nation. Now she has to deal with the consequences.\u201dThat Solo had one of the worst games of her career was occasion for paroxysms of joy. Although, in truth, that anger did not feel deep. More striking was the newfound support for the women. Wandering through downtown Manaus, a place of pastel-colored, colonial-age buildings and perpetually busy markets that is ringed by a forest of office towers, I heard again and again a respect mixed with chagrin that fans had taken so long to embrace the women\u2019s game.Renato Andrade da Silva, a cabdriver, had the Olympics playing on a tiny screen in his cab as he hurtled through traffic. That night\u2019s game was must-see television.\u201cThe women are such a great surprise, and the men, not so much,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to like the men more; that was my mistake.\u201dAt a cafe in a baroque old opera house, I spoke with the barista Marcelo Gadhella, 30. \u201cThe women should be given a lot more credit,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the men deserve less credit.\u201dAt a nearby table, Karen Marinho, 25, nodded. She is an aspiring archaeologist and loves the women\u2019s game. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of women nowadays who go to watch, and they bring their spouses,\u201d she said. \u201cThe macho men say: \u2018Oh! Now the women play like little men.\u2019\u201dShe rolled her eyes. More money, she said, needs to go into promotion and player development. The women\u2019s championship games run only on obscure cable channels; the men\u2019s game is on all public channels.Vad\u00e3o, the Brazilian coach, noted that his team took a cheap flight to Manaus, which is four hours by air from Rio de Janeiro. There was no food, and his players were crowded in economy.Such problems are not unique to Brazil. American female players have filed suit seeking pay equity with the less successful American men\u2019s national team. Players in women\u2019s leagues in Europe and elsewhere remain distinct second-class citizens, their games underpublicized and spottily attended.Perhaps Tuesday evening\u2019s double bill offered a window into a better future. Such was the view of Vera Pauw, the lithe Dutch woman who coaches the South African team. She came to the interview room with jaw set grim, her Olympic road at an end. Then she spoke of the artistry of the Brazilians and of the grit of her team, and especially of all those cheering fans.\u201cBrazil showcased a very mature women\u2019s play and pace; it was beautiful,\u201d she said. \u201cNow we know what we could do with a professional league in South Africa.\u201dShe smiled at herself. People, she said, will tell you that she is not one to gush. She could not help herself. \u201cTo see a huge stadium filled, with fans behind every women\u2019s kick, was fantastic,\u201d she said.That is an Amazonian reverie right there.Email: powellm@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "America\u2019s First Offshore Wind Farm May Power Up a New Industry", "Date": "2016-08-22", "News": "By DegreesA just-completed project off the coast of Rhode Island, though relatively tiny, is at the forefront of a sea-based transition to renewable energy.Supported byBLOCK ISLAND, R.I. \u2014 The towering machines stand a few miles from shore, in a precise line across the seafloor, as rigid in the ocean breeze as sailors reporting for duty.The blades are locked in place for now, but sometime in October, they will be turned loose to capture the power of the wind. And then, after weeks of testing and fine-tuning, America\u2019s first offshore wind farm will begin pumping power into the New England electric grid.The idea of building turbines offshore, where strong, steady wind could, in theory, generate large amounts of power, has long been seen as a vital step toward a future based on renewable energy. Yet even as European nations installed thousands of the machines, American proposals ran into roadblocks, including high costs, murky rules about the use of the seafloor, and stiff opposition from people who did not want their ocean views marred by machinery.\u201cPeople have been talking about offshore wind for decades in the United States, and I\u2019ve seen the reaction \u2014 eyes roll,\u201d Jeffrey Grybowski said last week in an interview on Block Island. \u201cThe attitude was, \u2018It\u2019s not going to happen; you guys can\u2019t do it.\u2019\u201dMr. Grybowski and the company he runs, Deepwater Wind of Providence, R.I., have now done it. They had a lot of help from the political leadership of Rhode Island, which has seized the lead in this nascent industry, ahead of bigger states like New York and Massachusetts.Now, offshore wind may be on the verge of rapid growth in the United States.Equally important, state governments in recent months have been making big, new commitments to renewable power, driven by a rising sense of urgency about climate change.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York set a goal of getting 50 percent of the state\u2019s power from renewable sources by 2030, and the state will probably need large offshore wind farms to help achieve that. In Massachusetts, a Republican governor, Charlie Baker, just signed a bipartisan bill ordering the state\u2019s utilities to develop contracts with offshore wind farms for an immense amount of power, 50 times the expected output of the Block Island Wind Farm.If that sounds ambitious, consider that the country has installed some 50,000 wind turbines on land over the past two decades. They now supply roughly 5 percent of the nation\u2019s electric power, a figure that reaches double digits in particularly windy states like Kansas and Iowa.The turbines are easier and cheaper to build on land. But the wind is also weaker on land, and the power the machines produce there is intermittent. The stronger breezes in the ocean can produce steadier power, potentially helping to balance out intermittent renewable sources like solar panels and onshore turbines.The technology has been proved in Europe, where offshore wind farms as large as 300 turbines are being developed, with each turbine costing up to $30 million to build, install and connect to the power grid.But the first major proposal in the United States, an immense project off Cape Cod that was to be called Cape Wind, was too big \u2014 130 turbines \u2014 and too close to shore, many experts now believe. It drew ferocious opposition from oceanfront homeowners, gradually lost political support in Massachusetts and appears unlikely to go forward.The companies now trying to start an offshore wind industry are determined not to repeat the mistakes that plagued Cape Wind. That is one reason Deepwater Wind decided to start with a small project.The focus is still on the Northeast. That region has dense cities with strong electrical demand, high power prices, opposition to new power plants on land and some of the world\u2019s stiffest ocean breezes off the coast. And the water remains relatively shallow many miles from shore, so wind farms could be installed far enough away that most of them would not be visible from the beaches.With Northeastern states committing to the idea, the big question is: How much would it cost to get thousands of offshore turbines up and running?When the first offshore projects were built two decades ago, European nations had to promise the developers extremely high prices for the electricity generated by their turbines, sometimes three or four times the wholesale power price, to get a new industry going.Since then, offshore wind turbines have become a big business in Europe, worth billions, and the companies installing them have been able to create economies of scale. Recently, European nations have scrapped their old subsidy methods and have used competitive bidding to drive down the cost of the projects.In some ways, the United States benefited by waiting for the industry to mature, as it can now take advantage of those falling costs. Installation is still pricier here than in Europe, and may be for a while, because few American companies have invested in the boats and other gear necessary to do the work.The Block Island turbines were built overseas by a division of General Electric and were installed by a ship from Norway, brought over at a cost of millions of dollars, with help from an American vessel.Yet if states go forward with their plans, experts say the costs are likely to fall sharply as domestic industry scales up to meet the demand. On the Block Island project, a company in Houma, La., won the contract to build the metal foundations in the water, and other Gulf Coast businesses that have long built offshore oil structures see wind power in the Northeast as a potential new market.For now, the construction of the first wind farm off an American coast sends a simple message to governments, investors and citizens: It can be done.\u201cSpectacular!\u201d Mr. Grybowski said from the deck of a boat last week as he watched the final stages of construction.The Block Island project was a marriage of Rhode Island political will and New York financial expertise. Initial financing for the $300 million project came from the D. E. Shaw Group, a big investment firm based in Manhattan.D. E. Shaw\u2019s head of United States private equity investment, Bryan Martin, had invested huge sums over the years on the firm\u2019s behalf in onshore wind farms, convinced that renewable energy was poised to displace fossil fuels. He saw offshore wind power as the next step and has been pushing the Block Island wind farm and other Deepwater Wind projects forward for more than a decade.The turbines are about three miles off Block Island and can be seen easily from land. That drew some opposition, and could have been fatal.But Block Island is a rustic vacation spot where residents turned out to be largely supportive of the project. Not only does it help the environment, but it will connect their power grid to the mainland for the first time, giving them a more reliable supply.Competitors are moving to challenge Deepwater Wind for the coming wave of offshore contracts, but the company hopes to hold its lead and win the next project, a proposed wind farm 36 miles off Montauk, N.Y., meant to supply the power-hungry South Fork of Long Island.\u201cI do believe that starting small has made sense,\u201d said Mr. Martin, who is also Deepwater Wind\u2019s chairman. \u201cI would say that the next projects are going to be substantially bigger.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Colombia\u2019s New, Legal Drug Barons Focus on Medical Marijuana", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIONEGRO, Colombia \u2014 Like many drug barons in Colombia, Federico Cock-Correa wants to sell his product globally. Just 15 miles outside Medell\u00edn, Mr. Cock-Correa is looking to replace vast acres of flowers with marijuana plants, with plans to export the harvest.But unlike the brutal heroin and cocaine trade that once flourished nearby, his operation has the government\u2019s stamp of approval.Officials hope the move will put a dent in Colombia\u2019s drug trafficking business by creating a legal opportunity in an industry historically controlled by the black market. The authorities believe the new law will also help attract investment and give the economy a lift, though it will take several years before the returns on the investments become clear.\u201cIt\u2019s health; it\u2019s science; it\u2019s the opportunity to redeem the name of the country,\u201d said Mr. Cock-Correa, who heads the Colombian arm of PharmaCielo, one company looking to capitalize on the new rules. \u201cIt\u2019s a shift from producing the plant that kills to producing the plant that cures.\u201d\u201cWe think that Colombia can build a successful international business around the exportation of medical marijuana,\u201d Alejandro Gaviria, Colombia\u2019s health minister, said in an email. \u201cThe country is ready to participate in this emerging global market.\u201dOther companies have followed suit. In July, the government granted production licenses to another Canadian company, Cannavida, and a Colombian company, Labfarve-Ecomedics. Unlike PharmaCielo, Labfarve-Ecomedics will focus on the domestic market, which may allow it to start faster since it will not need an export license.Once it receives approval, PharmaCielo will start growing marijuana and then process the material into medical products that can be exported to Canada and other countries that allow the importation of medical cannabis. The United States, for now, remains a long way off.\u201cUltimately, this has the ability to be a global marketplace measured in the billions,\u201d said Anthony Wile, a Canadian venture capitalist who is one of PharmaCielo\u2019s backers. Jim Rogers, a co-founder with George Soros of the Quantum Fund, is also an investor.Standing on a 32-acre plot of land that will be PharmaCielo\u2019s initial site, Mr. Cock-Correa set out his case for why Colombia is ideal for marijuana production, centered on the country\u2019s advantageous climate and soil conditions. There is a reason that Pablo Escobar got his start in the Colombian drug world by trafficking marijuana.For over 50 years, the Rionegro region in the Colombian Andes \u2014 where PharmaCielo has its land \u2014 has been one of the premier locations for the production of cut flowers bound for the United States and Europe. The region accounts for a quarter of all the flower exports from Colombia, the leading supplier of cut flowers to the United States.Expansive greenhouses, constructed of simple white plastic tarps draped over support poles and wiring, dot the area\u2019s rich green hills. The fertile volcanic soil nurtures flowers like chrysanthemums and carnations year round.At the heart of the company\u2019s plans, though, are the finances.When production is in full swing, PharmaCielo expects to produce a gram of marijuana flowers for about 5 cents. The same amount costs at least 10 times as much to produce in the United States and Canada.In North America, marijuana growers generally have two options: grow the crop outdoors, which produces just one harvest a year, or grow it indoors in warehouses, which is energy-intensive.Companies investing in Colombia, however, want to rely on the country\u2019s natural attributes to break that mold.Marijuana plants move through the vegetative stage into the flowering stage when lighting conditions change. They grow larger, and their yield increases, the longer they are in the vegetative stage. They finally begin to flower when they are exposed to 12 hours of sunlight, followed by 12 hours in the dark, typically in the spring or summer.To achieve the 12-hour cycles, American and Canadian growers who want multiple harvests must rely on artificial lighting. But because it lies along the Equator, Colombia has more days that naturally follow the 12-hour pattern than countries that are farther north, like the United States and Canada.PharmaCielo plans to supplement the sun by using low-wattage LED bulbs to effectively trick the plants into staying in the vegetative stage.\u201cOur growth comes from sunshine,\u201d said Marcelo Siqueira, the acting chief operating officer at PharmaCielo Colombia. The company, as a result, expects to have four harvests a year at substantially lower costs than North American rivals.A network of reservoirs, meanwhile, help conserve water and, by extension, control costs. The fertility of the soil means the company will be less reliant on products like peat moss and shredded coconut fibers to help plants grow, in that way saving money and cutting down on waste.For now, however, PharmaCielo is in a holding pattern. As it awaits the necessary licenses, Mr. Cock-Correa is planting flowers on the company\u2019s 32 acres.Mr. Cock-Correa, who has been in the flower business for 30 years, says the process of switching the flower farm to a cannabis farm is straightforward. There is a trained work force, the infrastructure is in place and the soil is primed and ready for planting.Once it gets the right licenses, the company estimates that it could be managing about 1,500 acres of active cultivation in two years. Mr. Cock-Correa wants to contract with other nearby farms that currently grow flowers.On a tour of the initial plot in May, the dirt beds still had flowers in them. Workers were hurrying to finish cutting and packaging new blossoms in time for Mother\u2019s Day.\u201cAll of this,\u201d Mr. Cock-Correa said, \u201cwill be cannabis within a year.\u201dAn article on Friday about plans to grow medical marijuana in Colombia misstated the acreage that one company, PharmaCielo, expects to have under active cultivation in two years. It is about 1,500 acres, not 600.Advertisement"}

And to the degree a good economy (and good economic headlines) benefits the incumbent party, there\u2019s no question this helps Mrs. Clinton.Political science research particularly points to changes in income as being predictors of how people vote, and the July data on average hourly earnings suggest American workers are being paid more: a 2.6 percent gain over the last year, tied for the highest since 2009 and a comfortable gain in workers\u2019 purchasing power in an era of roughly 1 percent annual inflation.And while the proportion of Americans who were in the labor force \u2014 either working or looking for work \u2014 ticked up in July, it has recovered only a tiny sliver of its decline since the 2008 recession (it was 66 percent in December 2007, bottomed out last year at 62.4 percent, and has recovered slightly to 62.8 percent).Part of this drop is because baby boomers are hitting retirement age, but some large portion is less well understood, driven by both men and women of prime working age who tell survey-takers they\u2019re not even looking for jobs.If you try to search the latest Labor Department numbers for bad news, the closest you\u2019ll find is a rise in the number of people who have been unemployed for 27 weeks \u2014 in other words, people who may say they want work but are becoming increasingly unattached from the habits of holding down a job.So that creates a fascinating backdrop for the economic discussion during the homestretch of the election. The economy truly is growing, and job growth looks to be robust. Expect President Obama and his administration to celebrate (and seek credit for) the good numbers.Expect Mrs. Clinton to seek to show empathy for those who are being left behind even by this stronger recovery and to avoid claims that the economy is as robust as the headline numbers might suggest. And don\u2019t be surprised if Mr. Trump repeats his claims that the economy is actually very weak. (He would have been on sounder footing using the poor second-quarter G.D.P. report late last week to make that argument, but he was distracted by other battles.)Here\u2019s an interpretation of the available data over the last several months that incorporates all these realities. You probably won\u2019t hear it on the campaign trail, but if a candidate\u2019s job was to provide nuance rather than get elected, this is what could be said:The United States economy is creating jobs at a rapid pace; most people who say they want a job are able to find one, and employers are having a hard enough time finding workers that they\u2019re having to pay higher wages. But large segments of the population, especially those without advanced education, left the labor force during the last several years, and relatively few of them are being pulled back in by this improving job market. Fixing that will be an important goal of the next president. Meanwhile, for reasons that aren\u2019t fully understood, economic output is growing much slower than job creation, which will mean lower living standards in the future if that continues. That should be another big worry for whoever occupies the Oval Office in January.Not the stuff of boisterous campaign rallies, but that\u2019s what the facts are telling us.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Occupying the Prairie: Tensions Rise as Tribes Move to Block a Pipeline", "Date": "2016-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEAR CANNON BALL, N.D. \u2014 Horseback riders, their faces streaked in yellow and black paint, led the procession out of their tepee-dotted camp. Two hundred people followed, making their daily walk a mile up a rural highway to a patch of prairie grass and excavated dirt that has become a new kind of battlefield, between a pipeline and American Indians who say it will threaten water supplies and sacred lands.But the people who stood at the gates of a construction site where crews had been building an access road toward the pipeline viewed the project as a wounding intrusion onto lands where generations of their ancestors hunted bison, gathered water and were born and buried, long before treaties and fences stamped a different order onto the Plains.People have been gathering since April, but as hundreds more poured in over the past two weeks, confrontations began rising among protesters, sheriff\u2019s officers and construction workers with the pipeline company. Local officials are struggling to handle hundreds of demonstrators filling the roads to protest and camp out in once-empty grassland about an hour south of Bismarck, the state capital.More than 20 people have been arrested on charges including disorderly conduct and trespassing onto the construction site. The pipeline company says it was forced to shut down construction this month after protesters threatened its workers and threw bottles and rocks at contractors\u2019 vehicles.Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier of Morton County, who has led the law enforcement response, said at a news conference that he had received reports of weapons and gunshots around the demonstration, and that protesters were getting ready to throw pipe bombs at a line of officers standing between a rally and the construction site.Leaders from the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, whose reservation lies just south of the pipeline\u2019s path, say the protests are peaceful. Weapons, drugs and alcohol are prohibited from the protest camp. Children march in the daily demonstrations. The leaders believed the reports of pipe bombs were a misinterpretation of their calls for demonstrators to get out their wooden chanupa pipes \u2014 which have deep spiritual importance \u2014 and pass them through the crowd.The conflict may reach a crucial moment on Wednesday in a federal court hearing. The tribe has sued to block the pipeline and plans to ask a judge in Washington to effectively halt construction.The pipeline runs overwhelmingly along private land, but where it crosses bodies of water, federal rules come into play and federal approvals are required.The tribe says the pipeline\u2019s route under the Missouri River near here could threaten its water supplies if the pipeline leaks or breaks, and it says the United States Army Corps of Engineers failed to do proper cultural and historical reviews before granting federal approvals for the pipeline.\u201cThis is our homeland,\u201d said Phyllis Young, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux. \u201cWe are Dakota. Dakota means friend or ally. Dakota Access has taken our name.\u201dIn legal filings, the corps rejects those claims. It says it consulted extensively with tribes, including the Standing Rock Sioux, and it says that tribe has failed to describe specific cultural sites that would be damaged by the pipeline. Energy Transfer Partners says it has the necessary state and federal permits and hopes to finish construction by the end of the year. The pipeline\u2019s route starts in the Bakken oil fields of western North Dakota and ends in Illinois.With the fate of the land here and this $3.7 billion project in the air, people here have decided to take action. They are occupying the prairie.The protesters sleep in tents and tepees, cook food in open-air kitchens and share stories and strategies around evening campfires. There is even a day care. At morning meetings, speakers warn parents to keep their children away from the Missouri River at sunset, and remind one another they are camped out in prayer.\u201cIt\u2019s a major movement in Indian country,\u201d said CJ Clifford, a member of the Oglala Lakota, who drove up from the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. He saw the protests as part of a historical continuum reaching to Little Bighorn. This battle, he said, was being waged peacefully.For many, the effort was about reclaiming a stake in ancestral lands that had been whittled down since the 1800s, treaty by broken treaty.\u201cLands were constantly getting reduced, shaken up,\u201d said Dave Archambault II, the tribal chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux. \u201cI could give you a list of every wrongdoing this government did to our people. All of that is frustration pent up, and it\u2019s being recognized.\u201dHe added, \u201cIt\u2019s a tipping point for our nations.\u201dLocal law enforcement officers set up a barricade on the main road leading to the pipeline site, and officials here in Morton County called a special meeting on Monday to talk about the traffic and how to handle a hundreds-strong protest that could linger for weeks or months.At the sprawling campsite down the road from the protest site, there had been portable toilets, 500-gallon tanks of drinking water and an air-conditioned trailer with medical supplies provided by the state. But late Monday night, people at the camp said the medical trailer and water tanks had been removed, leaving them to scramble for a new water source for hundreds of people.After a prayer ceremony at the construction site one recent afternoon, a few young men on horseback opened the gate and rode onto the land. A few days earlier they might have been arrested and accused of trespassing, but that day there were no officers to stop them.The pipeline company said that it temporarily stopped work here this month while \u201claw enforcement works to contain the unlawful protests,\u201d but that construction was continuing elsewhere.Jon Eagle Sr., the historic preservation officer for the Standing Rock Sioux, watched from the side of the road as the young men rode into the grassy field, toward a construction floodlight and heaps of excavated dirt. He did not want the pipeline to breach this land. But he did not seem to approve of this either.\u201cThey need to stay out,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know where the burials are. They don\u2019t know where the sacred sites are. I\u2019m trying my best to keep the peace.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Dilma Rousseff Is Ousted as Brazil\u2019s President in Impeachment Vote", "Date": "2016-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRAS\u00cdLIA \u2014 The Senate on Wednesday impeached Dilma Rousseff, Brazil\u2019s first female president, and removed her from office for the rest of her term, the capstone of a power struggle that has consumed the nation for months and toppled one of the hemisphere\u2019s most powerful political parties.\u201cShe lacked it all,\u201d said Mentor Muniz Neto, a writer from S\u00e3o Paulo who described Ms. Rousseff\u2019s final ouster as a \u201cdeath foretold,\u201d asserting that she lacked charisma, competence and humility. \u201cWe deserved better.\u201dMichel Temer, 75, the interim president who served as Ms. Rousseff\u2019s vice president before breaking with her this year, is now expected to remain in office until the end of the current term in 2018.\u201cIt\u2019s painfully obvious that Temer is a slap in the face to Brazilian democracy,\u201d said Creuza Maria Oliveira, the president of the National Federation of Domestic Workers, which represents millions of maids who benefited from the strengthening of labor laws by Ms. Rousseff.\u201cDilma is a champion of the poor,\u201d said Ms. Oliveira, who was among the supporters of Ms. Rousseff who accompanied her to the Senate this week. \u201cTemer is a champion of his own political class, which he wants to shield from justice.\u201dMr. Temer\u2019s administration has \u201call the conditions needed to embark on a new route,\u201d Philipp Schiemer, the head of Mercedes-Benz\u2019s operations in Brazil, told reporters in recent days. \u201cWe need to decide if we want a Brazil like Venezuela or a Brazil inserted in the new world.\u201dStill others, including Ms. Rousseff, contend that the ease with which the political elite shunted aside the president will bring more divisiveness and political tumult in Brazil.\u201cThis is serious because other presidents of the republic will have to deal with this,\u201d Ms. Rousseff said this week in her testimony in the Senate, comparing her ouster to the coups toppling Brazilian leaders throughout much of the 20th century. \u201cIf that isn\u2019t political instability, then I don\u2019t know what is.\u201dUnlike many of the politicians who led the charge to oust her, Ms. Rousseff, 68, remains a rare breed in Brazil: a prominent leader who has not been accused of illegally enriching herself.Ms. Rousseff repeatedly insisted that she did nothing illegal, pointing out that her predecessors also manipulated the federal budget. But her opponents argued that the scale of her administration\u2019s transfers of funds between giant public banks, to the tune of about $11 billion, seriously eroded Brazil\u2019s economic credibility and helped her get re-elected unfairly in 2014.Ms. Rousseff will not go to jail after her conviction, but she expressed defiance throughout her trial, insisting that Brazil\u2019s economic crisis was largely the result of shifts in the global economy that cut commodities prices.Many voters also felt betrayed after Ms. Rousseff\u2019s re-election campaign, when she narrowly won on promises to maintain extensive state control over the economy, resulting in generous public spending. But once re-elected, she went in another direction, appointing a finance minister who tried to win approval for market-friendly policies.\u201cShe simply lied through her teeth to get re-elected, forming a wave of national indignation,\u201d said Antonio Ris\u00e9rio, a historian and cultural commentator. \u201cUpon perceiving that they voted for one person and elected another, the majority of the population started to want her head.\u201dWith Ms. Rousseff deposed, the Workers\u2019 Party, a dominant force in Brazilian politics for much of the past decade and a half, is now scrambling to find its way in a political landscape where conservative voices are growing more powerful.Even more damaging for the party, federal investigators are seeking graft charges against Mr. da Silva, the former labor leader universally known as Lula, who was president from 2003 to 2010. The move adds to mounting legal problems faced by Mr. da Silva, who is still signaling that he plans to run for president in 2018.Ms. Rousseff found herself increasingly isolated in recent months, with many in her party quietly withdrawing their support. But senators offered her a morsel of consolation by voting to allow her to run for public office, overruling an effort to make her ineligible from doing so for several years.And some in Ms. Rousseff\u2019s party defended her as she made her last-ditch effort before the Senate this week.\u201cYou veered from the narrative when you were elected president of the republic as a woman, from the left, a former militant against the dictatorship, without a husband to pose by your side in the photographs,\u201d said Regina Sousa, a Workers\u2019 Party senator from Piau\u00ed in northeast Brazil.\u201cYou never fit in the cute little dress designed by the conservative elite of this country,\u201d Ms. Sousa added.Heated tempers marked the trial in the Senate. Crying as she spoke, Jana\u00edna Paschoal, the law professor who was an author of the impeachment request, said she had been inspired by God and that she was seeking impeachment for the good of Ms. Rousseff\u2019s grandchildren.Ms. Rousseff\u2019s lawyer, Jos\u00e9 Eduardo Cardozo, said he was stunned that her opponents had dragged Ms. Rousseff\u2019s family into the acerbic debate, pointing out that Ms. Rousseff was never accused of embezzling public funds to benefit her family.\u201cIf you want to condemn her, go ahead, but don\u2019t mock the honor of a dignified woman,\u201d said Mr. Cardozo, also crying as he spoke.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cloud Computing Brings Sprawling Centers, but Few Jobs, to Small Towns", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBoydton JournalBOYDTON, Va. \u2014 A giant Microsoft facility just outside this very small town hides behind a quarter-mile berm and a guard house, across the highway from the rubble of a demolished prison.Behind the berm, six unmarked hangars each hold tens of thousands of computer servers. Microsoft has cleared enough scrub trees and vines for at least 15 of these buildings, and six more are already under construction.One thing there isn\u2019t much of at this Microsoft complex, one single computer data center, is long-term work. Microsoft says it might have \u201cseveral dozen\u201d employees in a place like this. They are mostly elite computer workers who tend not to come from Boydton, which lost a lot of good jobs when nearby factories closed and the prison shut down.So it is in a number of small towns across the country, as technology giants like Amazon, Google and Microsoft race to build networks of unprecedented size to provide services over the internet, a technology trend known as cloud computing. Local people, along with many economists and officials, often think these data centers are a key to an industrial revival. But the reality is less impressive.\u201cI\u2019ve worked on a lot of nuclear power plants, and these things are a lot bigger than that,\u201d said E. W. Gregory, the head of the local electrical workers\u2019 union. But \u201cthe first thing they put in was a guard shack and a fence. I\u2019ve filled rooms with people looking for entry-level work. None of it lasts.\u201dThe companies come to places like Boydton for basics like land, water and electricity. Even with low local wages, people are a high-cost item. As small as the staffs at these mammoth facilities are, companies say, perhaps a third of the company jobs will eventually be filled by robots.Google started building in eastern Oregon to be near cheap hydroelectric power on the Columbia River, and most recently it has focused on Iowa, Alabama and Tennessee. Microsoft has a center in Wyoming, and it bought a nine-hole golf course as part of a complex near West Des Moines, Iowa. Amazon recently built similar giant facilities on the outer reaches of Columbus, Ohio, and Dulles, Va.\u201cA lot of this stuff is put in rural parts of the country that used to be part of a manufacturing economy\u201d that has gone overseas, said Bill Coughran, a partner at the venture investment firm Sequoia Capital who ran much of Google\u2019s big engineering for eight years. \u201cTextiles and furniture created a big power grid in the south. Then those jobs went away.\u201dThat\u2019s been the story for Boydton, population 430, in the middle of tobacco country a few miles from the North Carolina border. The prison across from the Microsoft center closed in 2012. A nearby Burlington Industries textile plant that employed more than 2,000 shut in 2002. It was razed in 2012.The South Virginia tobacco economy collapsed as Americans cut back on smoking. But in 1999, Virginia used some of the $4.1 billion it received in a settlement with cigarette makers to build high-speed fiber-optic lines throughout the region.The broadband drew Microsoft, along with some financial perks. Mecklenburg County, which received $2.1 million from the state for the project, has given Microsoft 350 acres and offset personal property taxes by 82.5 percent, according to Wayne Carter, the county administrator.Initially, Apple, which is building a big cloud center for consumers\u2019 photos and music, wanted the Boydton site, but it went across the border to North Carolina, which promised tax breaks on its data center equipment. Not to be outdone, Virginia passed laws in 2009 and 2010 that exempted sales taxes on things like data center computer servers, software, power generators and chillers to cool all that equipment.\u201cWe\u2019ve had six years of construction work,\u201d said Mr. Carter. That has helped the county, he said, because even temporary workers rent houses, stay in hotels and eat in local restaurants.Microsoft did not dispute reports that it would spend $1.1 billion on the Boydton data center, and said that \u201con average, data centers employ tens to several dozen people,\u201d in a mixture of corporate and contracted positions. It declined to let a reporter tour the site.\u201cThey talked about 100 jobs, but it\u2019s a slow process,\u201d said Thomas C. Coleman III, the mayor of Boydton. So far, he says, the biggest impact \u201chas been a couple of lunch tables at the Triangle gas station.\u201dHe understates matters, but not by much. Mr. Gregory, the electrician, said his union had hundreds of applicants for work digging ditches and laying pipe, starting at $10.88 an hour. Wiring paid $28.59. Both jobs tended to last about six months, he said, with lots of attrition for the hard outdoor labor.Working as a security guard or as someone testing the wires inside the data center offers better money, but there are not many positions. Microsoft prefers to fly in its own specialists for some work, and it doesn\u2019t like hiring people who have worked in other big companies\u2019 cloud-computing centers, Mr. Gregory said. (Microsoft said it did not exclude candidates based on previous experience.)\u201cWe can provide a place to live, but all those contractors will move on to the next town where they\u2019re building,\u201d Mr. Coleman said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you can count on.\u201dThe big cloud networks are immensely profitable for the few companies who can operate these global systems. The biggest three cloud companies estimate that the global market in business computing is worth $1 trillion or more, and they are rushing to expand globally. In interviews, all said they spend more than $2 billion annually on this.\u201cIt\u2019s phenomenal how rapidly they are growing,\u201d said Erik Brynjolfsson, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has written extensively on the impact of new technologies. \u201cIt is the key enabler of all kinds of technology advances, starting with the things companies do now, but lots cheaper, including outsourcing tech jobs.\u201dThat is hard to imagine in places where local roots go so deep. Conversations here usually start with people explaining where they are from, and what their families did here for generations. \u201cBoydton is the quintessential quaint courthouse town,\u201d said Leigh Lambert, the town librarian. \u201cPeople from here love it. It feels like it\u2019s always with you.\u201dMs. Lambert grew up nearby, tried New York, and returned to work next to the court, which is adorned with a statue of a Confederate soldier. Microsoft initially came to a couple of town meetings, and it seemed to offer a way Boydton could come back. \u201cNow they\u2019re off by themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cWe hear they have a really nice Starbucks machine.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Just kidding.\u201cThe political elite was in a frenzy about what would happen if I got my short finger on the nuclear button. Where is the button, by the way? Or is it a football? I know football better than anyone. I used to play and even had a team. If I find that football, I\u2019m gonna punt it right at Little Mikie Bloomberg. Talk about a traitor.\u201cHe was the guy who kicked off all the crazy talk about me being crazy at the Democratic convention, after he used to kiss up to me all the time and talk about how charismatic I am. He called me to rescue the Ferry Point golf course. And we all know he can\u2019t stand Hillary. She must have promised him Treasury secretary.\u201cSo many things to do.

The greatest temperament in the history of temperaments because you go through pressure and you have to be able to handle pressure. The brouhaha over whether I was a nut job was so unfair. It got so big that Dr. Phil and Dr. Drew were both on TV analyzing my so-called narcissistic personality disorder.\u201cThey said this happens when megalomania and a sense of omnipotence, which are normal in childhood, are carried over into adulthood. They said the symptoms are an excessive need for admiration, a lack of empathy for others\u2019 feelings, an obsession with achieving power and success, and the desire to take advantage of people around you.\u201cDoes that even sound remotely like me?

They thought I wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it without lashing out or dropping out. And they worried that my brand would go from Winning to Losing. But I knew those polls were rigged. The poorly educated angry white people still flocked to my rallies and I knew they would carry me through.\u201cThose haters gave me so much love and support that it comforted me. They believed me when I told them the economy had hit rock bottom, even though the jobs and wage numbers showed otherwise.\u201cIt was a long, hot summer.

That pathological liar could never get her stories straight on those emails. She just got more and more tangled up, parsing her parsing. She\u2019s disgusting.

{"Headline": "Democrats, Looking Past Mere Victory, Hope to End the Trump Movement", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDemocrats had hoped the party\u2019s convention last week in Philadelphia would win over skeptical voters and ease concerns about Hillary Clinton\u2019s trustworthiness, giving her a slight advantage in an unpredictable election year.\u201cIt\u2019s a more permanent turning point,\u201d said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York.Allies remain skittish and say that by many measures, Mrs. Clinton is a weak candidate with a muddled message who faces an electorate in which a majority of voters do not trust or like her.But Mr. Trump\u2019s inability to seize on his own party\u2019s convention and emerge a more disciplined candidate has eased early concerns that he could appeal to a broader electorate in the fall.\u201cHe couldn\u2019t have done a better job of reminding people who were on the fence why they can\u2019t vote for him,\u201d Mr. Malloy said.The proposition seemed far-fetched at the time, given the realities of the electoral map and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s weaknesses. But in recent days, Democrats and advisers have, delicately, embraced the idea.\u201cThe first order of business is winning,\u201d said Geoff Garin, a strategist for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign who now advises Priorities USA Action, a pro-Clinton \u201csuper PAC.\u201d \u201cBut the larger stakes of the election are putting the country on a path where Trump\u2019s views of the world are far in our rearview mirror.\u201dSenator Barbara Boxer of California said that a Democratic win in November was far from guaranteed, but that she hoped for \u201ca complete revulsion of the Trump wing\u201d that would lead to a \u201crealignment\u201d of the Republican Party.Mr. Obama, who is known to be competitive, has also prioritized making sure the voters who backed him in 2008 and 2012 turn out in equal numbers for Mrs. Clinton. \u201cHe wants them to not just vote for him but to vote for the issues he cares about,\u201d said Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to Mr. Obama.Mr. Plouffe, elaborating on his earlier Twitter post, said in an email, \u201cThis could still be a relatively close race, but it\u2019s more likely to be a blowout than a Trump win.\u201dTrying to seize on her postconvention edge, Mrs. Clinton has campaigned in Republican areas of Ohio and Pennsylvania, and held a rally in deep-red Nebraska on Monday. She is asking voters to \u201cput country over party\u201d as she scorns Mr. Trump over his hiring of foreign workers at his country clubs. \u201cShame on you, Donald Trump,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said on Sunday.For the first time, Mrs. Clinton holds a lead against Mr. Trump among voters regarding the economy, with 50 percent saying they trust her compared with 48 percent for Mr. Trump, who led on the issue by 11 percentage points in July.\u201cDonald Trump did not do anything to expand his appeal beyond his core supporters,\u201d said Brian Fallon, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign. Mrs. Clinton, he added, has made \u201cinroads with voters who might not have supported her previously.\u201dEven so, today\u2019s extreme partisan divisions make blowouts like Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s 1964 defeat of Barry Goldwater and Richard Nixon\u2019s 1972 victory over George McGovern unimaginable, presidential historians said.Over the last 20 years, the number of Americans who hold extreme conservative or liberal views has doubled to 21 percent in 2014 from 10 percent in 1994, according to the Pew Research Center. And the middle has shrunk.\u201cIt\u2019s closer than anyone of us would want it to be,\u201d said John L. Burton, the chairman of the California Democratic Party. \u201cThose who say, \u2018Let\u2019s have the Nixon sweep against McGovern,\u2019 are talking through their hat.\u201dEven with a newfound spring in their step, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s aides say she will not have anything resembling an easy or predictable ride to Election Day.Mrs. Clinton has only recently emerged from an F.B.I. investigation into her use of a private server at the State Department, and although there were no indictments, questions persist about her judgment and trustworthiness in handling her emails.In the past two months, Mr. Trump and the Republican National Committee saw a flood of online donations to help him almost bridge the financial divide with Mrs. Clinton, another sign that the race could be closer than expected.Matthew Dowd, an Independent political consultant and former strategist for George W. Bush, pointed out that no candidate has come out of a convention with unfavorable ratings as high as Mrs. Clinton\u2019s and gone on to win the White House. But unlike most candidates, Mrs. Clinton faces a fall contest against an opponent who is even more disliked.\u201cIt\u2019s like two villains from a Batman movie are running against each other and voters say, \u2018I\u2019m going to go with the one who isn\u2019t the crazy Joker,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Dowd said.But in the past few days, even skittish Democrats have demonstrated confidence that Mr. Trump has made the conversation about himself and the swirl of controversy over his words in his own party, rather than attacking Mrs. Clinton.In interviews, several of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s allies pointed to a three-month sprint to Election Day in which they predicted that Mr. Trump would continue to distract from his message and that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign could quietly work to build up her support and register voters in critical battlegrounds.These Democrats pointed to Mr. Trump\u2019s presumably laying the groundwork for a prolonged post-Labor Day fight over whether he will participate in the presidential debates. He expressed complaints this week that the bipartisan commission that arranges the events had scheduled two of the three to take place during professional football games.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question he\u2019ll drive the next 11 weeks,\u201d said William M. Daley, Mr. Obama\u2019s former White House chief of staff. \u201cShe\u2019s out there with a message, whether it\u2019s moving anything, great. But he\u2019s embroiled.\u201dMrs. Clinton\u2019s reliance on Mr. Trump\u2019s misfires, rather than the strength or resonance of her own message, is an inherently risky strategy, Mr. Dowd said. \u201cWhat if for the next 90 days he stops shooting himself in the foot?\u201d he asked.But Democrats said the period of wondering whether Mr. Trump could become a more disciplined candidate had ended with his attacks on the Khans.\u201cIt\u2019s like saying if I became eight feet tall, I\u2019d be a great starter for the Cleveland Cavaliers,\u201d said Guy Cecil, chief strategist at Priorities USA Action. \u201cIt\u2019s never going to happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Has Wall Street Been Tamed?", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyBefore the financial crisis, bankers were often regarded as greedy and self-\u00adinterested. The mortgage melt down \u00adratcheted that reputation into something much scarier: an existential threat to the global economy. Since 2008, the banks have seemed to many people like an active volcano does to the villagers below. Americans don\u2019t really understand banks, or know what causes them to blow up, but they\u2019ve seen enough to be afraid.And to hear the public discussion about the issue these days, we still have good reason to be scared. The Republican presidential candidates generally agreed that Wall Street banks remain dangerously too big to fail. On the left, Bernie Sanders built that notion \u2014 and demands for a major policy response to it \u2014 into the foundation of his campaign. From Hollywood, we got \u201cThe Big Short\u201d and its judgment, in the words of Ryan Gosling\u2019s character, that \u201cthe banks took the money the American people gave them and used it to lobby the Congress to kill big reform.\u201dI began writing about the industry in early 2010, just after the worst of the crisis passed and right before Congress enacted its landmark effort to clean up Wall Street, what\u2019s now known as Dodd-Frank. I was in Washington when the final version of the law was released. Along with all the discussion about its being the most significant reform of Wall Street since the Great Depression, I remember the confusion as we flipped through the thousands of pages, trying to pick out what would really matter, looking for where the lobbyists had won. Six years later, as I plan a move to the West Coast for a slightly different reporting beat, I keep returning to this question of how much has really changed. Is the system any safer than when I began?Dodd-Frank was designed, in essence, to check the pre-\u00adcrisis excesses that ultimately required the government to bail out the largest banks. But upon its unveiling, it did seem as though some of the most consequential efforts to transform the banks had been edited out at the industry\u2019s behest. The law didn\u2019t seem to address many of the risky practices that transmuted a downturn in the subprime-\u00admortgage market into a global conflagration. Perhaps most consequential, as Sanders has not tired of reminding us, the biggest banks were not broken up. Just a day after the law was passed, a bank analyst made a prediction for me: \u201cAfter the dust settles and they\u2019ve crossed all the T\u2019s, there\u2019s probably not going to be much difference in how the banking industry looks. That\u2019s the long and short of it.\u201d\u00adJPMorgan Chase, the nation\u2019s largest bank, has shrunk since 2014, but it entered 2016 with 50 percent more assets than it had in 2007, in great part because of its acquisition (on the cheap) of Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual in 2008. Early this spring, the top banking regulators announced that because of their size and complexity, five of the eight largest banks, including JPMorgan, still didn\u2019t have workable plans to avoid going out of business without taking the economy down with them \u2014 suggesting that they would probably need to be bailed out if they began to collapse again.So are they headed toward failure? To judge the likelihood of that, the first thing to consider is what types of risk they\u2019re taking on. And on that front, at least, the changes have been far more notable than most Americans realize. For starters, Dodd-Frank\u2019s \u201cVolcker Rule\u201d forced the banks to get rid of the trading desks where they made enormous speculative bets for their own profit. There was some talk that the banks would find a way around the rule, but almost every bank has disbanded these trading teams or sold them to hedge funds. And this is just one of the risky businesses that the big banks have jettisoned in recent years. The most risky \u2014 and profitable \u2014 units at all the banks before the crisis were the so-\u00adcalled fixed-\u00adincome divisions, where the banks created and traded bonds and derivatives. In 2006, these departments were the single largest sources of revenue at banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Today, by contrast, the amount of money the big banks make from their fixed-\u00adincome divisions is less than half of what it was at the peak in 2009, and it continues to fall.There are multiple reasons for this evolution, including global economic shocks like the Greek debt crisis and the new trading rules in Dodd-Frank. But the greatest engine of change has been some rather arcane accounting rules, known as capital requirements, set by the central banks of governments around the world. Put most simply, capital requirements force banks to raise a specific amount of money (usually from investors) for every dollar they lend or trade. In 2010, central banks agreed that the large commercial banks needed to double or even triple their capital buffers. Riskier ventures require even more capital.The most immediate impact of these rules has been to serve as a sort of brake on business activity, given the hassle and cost of raising more capital. And indeed, when banks today explain why they are moving into or abandoning certain businesses, they almost always cite capital requirements as their main motivation. The Federal Reserve official in charge of these regulations, Daniel Tarullo, was recently called \u201cthe most powerful man in banking\u201d by The Wall Street Journal. Tarullo is now pushing to raise the capital requirements even higher for the very largest banks, like JPMorgan and Citigroup, and there are signs that this could do what Bernie Sanders could not: force the biggest banks to split themselves up.Among the many shrinking banks, one of the most noteworthy is Goldman Sachs, a villain of the crisis and the firm everyone assumed would outsmart the regulators. In large part because of capital requirements and their quieting effect on all sorts of trading, Goldman has slashed staff from the risky, lucrative lines of businesses it used to dominate. Now the firm is focusing its efforts in less risky places, where capital requirements are lower. Its newest products are savings accounts and consumer loans, plebeian products that Goldman would never have deigned to offer before the crisis. The company as a whole has shrunk by nearly a quarter since its peak.Even highly capitalized banks can still suffer unexpected losses. But in addition to discouraging risky activity, capital also serves as money that banks can afford to lose in a crisis. Unlike the debt that banks loaded up on before the crisis, capital does not have to be repaid in the event of a loss. Having this sort of cushion can in turn stop losses from spiraling out into and threatening the rest of the economy. The nation\u2019s eight most important banks now have 66 percent more capital than they did at the end of 2009, and the Fed recently said, after extensive testing, that the nation\u2019s 33 largest banks could survive a two-year depression \u2014 and lose hundreds of billions of dollars \u2014 and still have more capital than the new rules require.Michael Lewis, the author of \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d has been one of many industry critics to complain that the biggest continuing problem in the financial industry is that the incentives haven\u2019t changed: Bankers are encouraged to take short-term risks, without bearing the losses if those risks cause long-term damage. In fact, pay packages have changed more than Lewis lets on. Some traders now receive their bonuses over several years, in case past deals go sour, and regulators are currently codifying those practices.But to focus on pay packages misses how capital requirements have changed incentives for the entire system. I hear constantly from traders who say that the daily work of buying and selling bonds or stocks, and thus the amount of money they can take home, is constrained by the capital limits. This helps explain why at Goldman, for example, the average pay per employee has fallen 24 percent since 2010 and 39 percent since 2007. This also illuminates why Wall Street is in decline as the career path of choice at elite colleges and business schools.People still have other concerns about Wall Street, including cases of fraud and market manipulation, so the banks are unlikely to disappear as political fodder in a presidential campaign between two New Yorkers for whom Wall Street is a recurring issue. Each side is likely to signal its intent to get tough on the industry that nearly wiped out the economy. But if Wall Street remains a volcano, it\u2019s one I now feel far more safe living underneath.Nathaniel Popper is a reporter for The Times and the author of \u201cDigital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money.\u201d Adam Davidson will return next month.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alexander McCall Smith Fills in the Lives Behind Five Vintage Photographs", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Alexander McCall Smith is a prolific writer, with over 80 books to date, including the best-selling series \u201cThe No.\u202f1 Ladies\u2019 Detective Agency.\u201d I am a fan of his \u201c44 Scotland Street\u201d novels, subtle comedies chronicling life among the comfortable classes at the bohemian end of Edinburgh\u2019s New Town. Each closes with a festive gathering where Angus \u00adLordie, portrait artist and proud companion of Cyril, a dog distinguished by a gold tooth, improvises a poem celebrating human fellowship. \u201cChance Developments,\u201d \u00adMcCall Smith\u2019s new collection of stories, has less of the gentle satire that moderates the sentiment in Scotland Street. But these stories are also written in praise of the human capacity for love.They were inspired by a handful of \u201corphaned\u201d or unattributed black-and-white photographs of unknown people in unnamed locations. McCall Smith imagines a family history or a personal odyssey behind each print, along with settings that range across continents, from a traveling circus in Canada to an Australian mining town, the Scottish Highlands and the Tuscan hills. Yet, characteristically, what he finds is not difference or strangeness but what we have in common. A village schoolteacher in the west of Ireland chafes at his humdrum future and falls for an unknown girl in a beautiful car; a nun leaves the convent and has the new adventure of taking tea in a department store; a nerdish young man, exhausting his parents with his obsession with the memory-training system known as \u00adPelmanism, embarks on life as a showman. A sense of possibility, of the \u00adsurprises that make even the quietest existence eventful, animates each tale.McCall Smith travels lightly over history and across generations, evoking the past with a deft feel for period detail and the local lingo. He is a past master at using the economy of the short story to highlight the amplitude of the imagination. Photographs are always memento mori, arresting life. But in fiction and fantasy we need never come to a full stop. These tales are romances, although not because they are mainly, as he puts it in an author\u2019s note, \u201clove stories in one sense or another.\u201d Their romance lies in the faith that we can be transformed by our affections, transported to our better selves. In McCall Smith\u2019s generous world, love is always a hopeful sign, whatever the object. In the circus story, when Ruby the ventriloquist loses her beloved dummy in a fire she is aptly consoled by the human cannonball: \u201cHe was a great prop, Harold was. He wouldn\u2019t have known anything about it. The heat was very intense.\u201dMcCall Smith doesn\u2019t do spleen, cynicism or despair. Suffering tends to happen discreetly, between the section breaks; setbacks are met by good-\u00adnatured philosophizing or brisk moral bracing of the sort espoused by Isabel Dalhousie, the scholar-heroine of \u201cThe Sunday Philosophy Club,\u201d another of his Edinburgh series. Politics rarely ruffles the surface; private virtues must be pitted against social inequality, while getting on in the world through self-reliance is no bad thing. Still, I couldn\u2019t quite imagine a Mother Superior letting go of one of her charges as agreeably as she does in the first story, confessing to the newly rich Sister Flora, \u201cBeing wealthy will be .\u2008.\u2008. well, rather nice, don\u2019t you think?\u201d But perhaps Scottish nuns are different.\u201cChance Developments\u201d will not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea. Even fans may find these serendipitous tales \u2014 comforting, touching and often funny though they are \u2014 just a little Panglossian. But does it matter? Like Angus Lordie\u2019s odes, these stories trust in the liberal, humane values that are at the heart of all McCall Smith\u2019s fiction. Can one have too much of that hopefulness? I doubt it.Alison Light\u2019s most recent book is \u201cCommon People: In Pursuit of My Ancestors.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Colorado Activists Submit Petitions for Referendums on Fracking", "Date": "2016-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn an effort to halt the advance of the oil industry in Colorado, environmental activists said they submitted enough signatures on Monday to place on November\u2019s ballot two initiatives aimed at severely limiting hydraulic fracturing.If either measure passes, it would represent the most serious political effort yet in the United States to stop hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, the technique used to blast through shale and other hard rocks with water, sand and chemicals to release oil and natural gas.One of the Colorado ballot initiatives would establish local control over oil and gas operations, including fracking, while the other would prohibit drilling and fracking in a buffer zone 2,500 feet around occupied buildings, waterways and open public spaces like parks. That could effectively prohibit new exploration and production in as much as 95 percent of the surface area of the state\u2019s five top petroleum- and gas-producing counties, according to Colorado regulators.The Colorado secretary of state\u2019s office has 30 days to authenticate the signatures, and challenges are considered probable. If the signatures hold up, oil industry officials say the contest should be a close, hard-fought battle.With the exception of New York State, which has banned fracking for its relatively modest reserves, few oil- and gas-producing states have put up any serious barriers to the practice.Led by a coalition of environmental organizations, activists fanned out across the state to collect signatures. They argue that local communities should have the right to limit fracking, which they say pollutes the air and jeopardizes local water supplies. Some 98,500 signatures are needed to get on the ballot. Activists said they submitted more than 100,000 signatures for each initiative.\u201cAt stake is the people\u2019s right to say no to fracking in their communities, the people\u2019s right to protect their well-being and safety and their families from industrial development in their backyards,\u201d said Jason Schwartz, a spokesman for Greenpeace.Business groups have begun a concerted effort to oppose the initiatives, raising more than $13 million. Anadarko Petroleum and Noble Energy, the two oil companies that stand to lose the most, have each contributed $5 million or more to the opposition campaign. Opponents have cited a recent study by the University of Colorado that warned that the more stringent initiative \u2014 the one that would create buffers \u2014 could cost the state 54,000 jobs between 2017 and 2021, and decrease state and local tax revenue.\u201cThis is bigger than any individual company,\u201d said John M. Christiansen, an Anadarko vice president. \u201cThese potential ballot measures would carry massive consequences for Colorado\u2019s economy, public education, public services and every consumer.\u201dThe nation\u2019s shale boom of recent years has made Colorado one of the fastest-growing energy producers. Between 2004 and 2014, oil production in the state quadrupled, according to the Energy Department, although it is now slowing because of the slump in prices. The state\u2019s vast Niobrara shale field contains an estimated two billion barrels of oil, making it one of the nation\u2019s largest.The propositions could also have an effect on the presidential race in Colorado, which is considered a swing state.Divisions on the issue cross party lines.Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee, told a Denver television station last week that he supported fracking but, in a break with the oil industry and many state Republicans, he suggested that localities should have a say in the matter. \u201cThere\u2019s some areas, maybe, they don\u2019t want to have fracking,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd I think if the voters are voting for it, that\u2019s up to them.\u201dHillary Clinton, his Democratic rival, has argued in favor of tight regulations on fracking and supported the right of states and localities to prohibit it.Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, has opposed a ban on fracking and in the past has encouraged compromise. Representative Jared Polis, also a Democrat, has donated $25,000 to a group that supports local controls on oil and gas operations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Court Upholds United Nations\u2019 Immunity in Cholera Suit", "Date": "2016-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA United States federal appeals panel has upheld the argument that the United Nations cannot be sued in American courts, dealing a setback in a class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of thousands of cholera victims in Haiti.In the decision for the panel, Judge Jos\u00e9 A. Cabranes of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit wrote that the United Nations did not lose its legal immunity even if it failed to give the plaintiffs a chance to seek a settlement, as required by an international convention.The decision slammed the door on a day of muted celebration by the plaintiffs and many people in Haiti who had welcomed a statement by Farhan Haq, the deputy spokesman for Mr. Ban, that the United Nations had \u201cbecome convinced that it needs to do much more regarding its own involvement in the initial outbreak\u201d of cholera and that officials were considering a \u201csignificant new set of U.N. actions\u201d to be presented publicly within two months.Mr. Haq\u2019s statement was in response to a confidential report sent to Mr. Ban by a United Nations adviser on Aug. 8. The report\u2019s draft language stated that the epidemic \u201cwould not have broken out before the actions of the United Nations.\u201dIt estimated the potential cost to the United Nations, were it to lose the lawsuit, at $40 billion, five times its annual worldwide peacekeeping budget.Mr. Haq, however, stopped short of acknowledging that the United Nations had specifically introduced cholera into Haiti, and he indicated that it would continue to assert immunity from lawsuits.He said Thursday that the United Nations did not yet have a comment on the federal appeals panel\u2019s decision.The plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers have 90 days to decide whether to appeal to the Supreme Court.One of the lawyers, Beatrice Lindstrom of the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti, said a decision on that would rest on how the United Nations followed up on its recent statements. \u201cIf the U.N. provides remedies to victims out of court, an appeal will be unnecessary,\u201d Ms. Lindstrom said.Scientists have found in repeated studies that cholera was almost certainly introduced to Haiti by Nepalese soldiers with the United Nations peacekeeping mission there in 2010. The soldiers, who had recently arrived from Nepal, where a cholera outbreak was underway, were stationed in an isolated rural base that the world body\u2019s own investigators have found was prone to leaking human waste into the adjacent Meille River.That river, which flows into Haiti\u2019s main waterway, the Artibonite, is where the first cholera deaths were recorded.The United Nations did not screen the soldiers for cholera, and it took years to comprehensively improve its sanitation practices in Haiti. It also refused, along with the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to carefully investigate whether its base was the source of the epidemic \u2014 even as thousands of Haitians were dying from the waterborne disease and medical responders were scrambling to figure out how to control its spread.The United Nations and its member countries have failed to follow through on promises to stem the tide of the disease. The official death toll from the cholera outbreak stands at nearly 10,000, but some scientists believe it is orders of magnitude higher. It has also badly damaged Haiti\u2019s economy and further torpedoed the recovery from the 7.0-magnitude earthquake that struck southern Haiti in 2010.Amid a patchwork of vaccination programs, emergency responses and badly underfunded development projects, cholera infection rates have increased in Haiti every year since 2014. At least 200 Haitians died in the first six months of 2016, according to Haitian health authorities.In 2011, lawyers with the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti organized 5,000 cholera victims and their families to seek redress within the United Nations, but in 2013, its Office of Legal Affairs rejected their claims as \u201cnot receivable.\u201dThe lawyers then filed the case, Georges v. United Nations, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, which ruled in favor of the United Nations in early 2015. Thursday\u2019s decision was in response to an appeal of that ruling.Lawyers arguing on behalf of the United Nations were from the United States Justice Department. They defended the world body\u2019s immunity under its Convention on Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, to which the United States is a signatory.The United States, which pays about a quarter of the United Nations peacekeeping budget and would likely be liable for much of the cost of a settlement with cholera victims, also has peacekeepers operating under similar conventions in other parts of the world.Judge Cabranes cited the Obama administration\u2019s interpretation of the convention as \u201csignificant\u201d and \u201centitled to great weight\u201d in his decision.Mr. Haq\u2019s admission this week was the result of a searing draft report from Philip Alston, a New York University law professor who serves as one of a few dozen experts, known as special rapporteurs, who advise the United Nations on human rights issues. Mr. Alston\u2019s report is likely to be revised before its official release later this year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Secret Ledger in Ukraine Lists Cash for Donald Trump\u2019s Campaign Chief", "Date": "2016-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 On a leafy side street off Independence Square in Kiev is an office used for years by Donald J. Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, when he consulted for Ukraine\u2019s ruling political party. His furniture and personal items were still there as recently as May.Handwritten ledgers show $12.7 million in undisclosed cash payments designated for Mr. Manafort from Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s pro-Russian political party from 2007 to 2012, according to Ukraine\u2019s newly formed National Anti-Corruption Bureau. Investigators assert that the disbursements were part of an illegal off-the-books system whose recipients also included election officials.Anti-corruption officials there say the payments earmarked for Mr. Manafort, previously unreported, are a focus of their investigation, though they have yet to determine if he actually received the cash. While Mr. Manafort is not a target in the separate inquiry of offshore activities, prosecutors say he must have realized the implications of his financial dealings.\u201cHe understood what was happening in Ukraine,\u201d said Vitaliy Kasko, a former senior official with the general prosecutor\u2019s office in Kiev. \u201cIt would have to be clear to any reasonable person that the Yanukovych clan, when it came to power, was engaged in corruption.\u201dMr. Kasko added, \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to imagine a person would look at this and think, \u2018Everything is all right.\u2019\u201dMr. Manafort did not respond to interview requests or written questions from The New York Times. But his lawyer, Richard A. Hibey, said Mr. Manafort had not received \u201cany such cash payments\u201d described by the anti-corruption officials.Mr. Hibey also disputed Mr. Kasko\u2019s suggestion that Mr. Manafort might have countenanced corruption or been involved with people who took part in illegal activities.\u201cThese are suspicions, and probably heavily politically tinged ones,\u201d said Mr. Hibey, a member of the Washington law firm Miller & Chevalier. \u201cIt is difficult to respect any kind of allegation of the sort being made here to smear someone when there is no proof and we deny there ever could be such proof.\u201dThe developments in Ukraine underscore the risky nature of the international consulting that has been a staple of Mr. Manafort\u2019s business since the 1980s, when he went to work for the Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos. Before joining Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign this spring, Mr. Manafort\u2019s most prominent recent client was Mr. Yanukovych, who \u2014 like Mr. Marcos \u2014 was deposed in a popular uprising.Before he fled to Russia two years ago, Mr. Yanukovych and his Party of Regions relied heavily on the advice of Mr. Manafort and his firm, who helped them win several elections. During that period, Mr. Manafort never registered as a foreign agent with the United States Justice Department \u2014 as required of those seeking to influence American policy on behalf of foreign clients \u2014 although one of his subcontractors did.It is unclear if Mr. Manafort\u2019s activities necessitated registering. If they were limited to advising the Party of Regions in Ukraine, he probably would not have had to. But he also worked to burnish his client\u2019s image in the West and helped Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s administration draft a report defending its prosecution of his chief rival, Yulia V. Tymoshenko, in 2012.Whatever the case, absent a registration \u2014 which requires disclosure of how much the registrant is being paid and by whom \u2014 Mr. Manafort\u2019s compensation has remained a mystery. However, a cache of documents discovered after the fall of Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s government may provide some answers.The papers, known in Ukraine as the \u201cblack ledger,\u201d are a chicken-scratch of Cyrillic covering about 400 pages taken from books once kept in a third-floor room in the former Party of Regions headquarters on Lipskaya Street in Kiev. The room held two safes stuffed with $100 bills, said Taras V. Chornovil, a former party leader who was also a recipient of the money at times. He said in an interview that he had once received $10,000 in a \u201cwad of cash\u201d for a trip to Europe.\u201cThis was our cash,\u201d he said, adding that he had left the party in part over concerns about off-the-books activity. \u201cThey had it on the table, stacks of money, and they had lists of who to pay.\u201dThe National Anti-Corruption Bureau, which obtained the ledger, said in a statement that Mr. Manafort\u2019s name appeared 22 times in the documents over five years, with payments totaling $12.7 million. The purpose of the payments is not clear. Nor is the outcome, since the handwritten entries cannot be cross-referenced against banking records, and the signatures for receipt have not yet been verified.\u201cPaul Manafort is among those names on the list of so-called \u2018black accounts of the Party of Regions,\u2019 which the detectives of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine are investigating,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe emphasize that the presence of P. Manafort\u2019s name in the list does not mean that he actually got the money, because the signatures that appear in the column of recipients could belong to other people.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a very vivid example of how political parties are financed in Ukraine,\u201d said Daria N. Kaleniuk, the executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center in Kiev. \u201cIt represents the very dirty cash economy in Ukraine.\u201dWhile working in Ukraine, Mr. Manafort had also positioned himself to profit from business deals that benefited from connections he had gained through his political consulting. One of them, according to court filings, involved a network of offshore companies that government investigators and independent journalists in Ukraine have said was used to launder public money and assets purportedly stolen by cronies of the government.The network comprised shell companies whose ultimate owners were shielded by the secrecy laws of the offshore jurisdictions where they were registered, including the British Virgin Islands, Belize and the Seychelles.In a recent interview, Serhiy V. Gorbatyuk, Ukraine\u2019s special prosecutor for high-level corruption cases, pointed to an open file on his desk containing paperwork for one of the shell companies, Milltown Corporate Services Ltd., which played a central role in the state\u2019s purchase of two oil derricks for $785 million, or about double what they were said to be worth.\u201cThis,\u201d he said, \u201cwas an offshore used often by Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s entourage.\u201dThe role of the offshore companies in business dealings involving Mr. Manafort came to light because of court filings in the Cayman Islands and in a federal court in Virginia related to an investment fund, Pericles Emerging Markets. Mr. Manafort and several partners started the fund in 2007, and its major backer was Mr. Deripaska, the Russian mogul, to whom the State Department has refused to issue a visa, apparently because of allegations linking him to Russian organized crime, a charge he has denied.Mr. Deripaska agreed to commit as much as $100 million to Pericles so it could buy assets in Ukraine and Eastern Europe, including a regional cable television and communications company called Black Sea Cable. But corporate records and court filings show that it was hardly a straightforward transaction.The Black Sea Cable assets were controlled by a rotating cast of offshore companies that led back to the Yanukovych network, including, at various times, Milltown Corporate Services and two other companies well known to law enforcement officials, Monohold A.G. and Intrahold A.G. Those two companies won inflated contracts with a state-run agricultural company, and also acquired a business center in Kiev with a helicopter pad on the roof that would ease Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s commute from his country estate to the presidential offices.Mr. Deripaska would later say he invested $18.9 million in Pericles in 2008 to complete the acquisition of Black Sea Cable. But the planned purchase \u2014 including the question of who ended up with the Black Sea assets \u2014 has since become the subject of a dispute between Mr. Deripaska and Mr. Manafort.In 2014, Mr. Deripaska filed a legal action in a Cayman Islands court seeking to recover his investment in Pericles, which is now defunct. He also said he had paid about $7.3 million in management fees to the fund over two years. Mr. Deripaska did not respond to requests for comment.Mr. Manafort\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Hibey, disputed the account of the Black Sea Cable deal contained in Mr. Deripaska\u2019s Cayman filings, and said the Russian oligarch had overseen details of the final transaction involving the acquisition. He denied that Mr. Manafort had received management fees from Pericles during its operation, but said that one of Mr. Manafort\u2019s partners, Rick Gates, who is also working on the Trump campaign, had received a \u201cnominal\u201d sum.Court papers indicate that Pericles\u2019 only deal involved Black Sea Cable.At Mr. Manafort\u2019s old office on Sofiivska Street, new tenants said they had discovered several curiosities apparently left behind, including a knee X-ray signed by Mr. Yanukovych, possibly referring to tennis matches played between Mr. Manafort and Mr. Yanukovych, who had spoken publicly of a knee ailment affecting his game.There was another item with Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s autograph: a piece of white paper bearing a rough sketch of Independence Square, the site of the 2014 uprising that drove him from power.Andrew E. Kramer reported from Kiev, and Mike McIntire and Barry Meier from New York. Steven Lee Myers contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Central Bankers Hear Plea: Turn Focus to Government Spending", "Date": "2016-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGRAND TETON NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. \u2014 Central bankers who gathered here to discuss better ways of jump-starting slow economic growth received a surprising message from their lunchtime speaker on Friday: Stop. You\u2019re making things worse.Christopher A. Sims, a Nobel laureate in economic science, told the annual conference that increased government spending was required to lift the world\u2019s major economies from stagnation. The pursuit of innovations in monetary policy, he said, is diverting needed attention from the inaction of fiscal policy makers.\u201cSo long as the legislature thinks it has no role in this problem, nothing is going to get done,\u201d said Mr. Sims, a professor at Princeton. The best hope, he said, \u201cis that people at central banks are willing to say publicly that this is what is necessary.\u201dDeveloped nations have leaned heavily on their central banks since the 2008 financial crisis. The United States, Europe and Japan have all relied on low interest rates to encourage increased spending by businesses and consumers even as government spending has remained relatively austere. Mr. Sims is among a growing number of experts who warn that this experiment has reached its limits.In the United States, the Federal Reserve responded to the crisis more forcefully than other central banks, and the federal government initially spent more freely. Yet here, too, growth remains slow, inflation remains weak and millions of middle-age people are no longer working.Moreover, he said central banks would be handicapped in fighting future crises \u2014 they have little room to cut rates should economic conditions deteriorate.Central bankers profess to regard this pessimism as overstated. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, and the heads of other major central banks have repeatedly urged lawmakers to lend a hand \u2014 albeit with considerable diffidence.However, they also describe their own efforts as effective even without fiscal support. They are increasingly resigned to slower growth and lower interest rates, yet they insist they still have the means \u2014 by buying government debt, for instance \u2014 to help reverse future downturns.Peter Blair Henry, the dean of the Stern School of Business at New York University, asked a panel of central bankers whether they were doing enough to explain the limits of their own powers, to focus the public on the importance of fiscal policy.\u201cEveryone is sort of waiting for the next pronouncement about monetary policy when that\u2019s really not the central issue,\u201d Mr. Henry, an expert on international development, said in an interview. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to communicate the limitations of what central bank policies can actually do to drive long-run growth. Central banks have done a real good job restoring stability, and we\u2019re at a point now where most of what needs to happen, needs to happen through structural reform.\u201dThe debt already is large by historical standards. And running up the tab during a period when the economy is growing, if slowly, may make it harder to spend freely during a future recession, when the need for government stimulus is more acute.\u201cA rush to reduce budget deficits after 2010 was the biggest error in this downturn,\u201d Mr. Elmendorf, former head of the Congressional Budget Office, said in a May presentation on the nation\u2019s economic woes.But that speech and subsequent pleas have not produced any noticeable effect on Germany, the country whose trade surplus is at the heart of Europe\u2019s problems.At this year\u2019s conference, Mr. Coeur\u00e9 described the efforts of European governments as \u201chalf-baked and halfhearted.\u201d But he made clear that the E.C.B. would press on by itself.\u201cI would argue that this fundamentally doesn\u2019t impair our ability to achieve our objective, but it has a strong impact on the way we do it,\u201d he said.Haruhiko Kuroda, the governor of the Bank of Japan, expressed a similar mix of helplessness and optimism. Japan has struggled with low inflation and slow growth for decades, and the bank\u2019s recent campaign to address the problem is perhaps the most aggressive of any developed nation. Yet the Japanese government has undermined those efforts, for example by imposing a large tax increase.\u201cI agree that monetary policy cannot do all things without the help of fiscal policy and structural policies,\u201d Mr. Kuroda said on Saturday. Asked what could be done to secure such help, he said that he met with the prime minister once or twice a month.\u201cIn that sense,\u201d he said, \u201cthe Bank of Japan is provided the opportunity to speak up.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Another Reason to Save the Good Stuff", "Date": "2016-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne amusing account of whisky\u2019s origin holds that it was invented by the Irish as an embrocation for sick mules. Then the Scots learned the knack of distilling fermented grain mash and discovered it was much more enjoyable to drink than rub on the skin of ailing animals.That increasing sophistication is reflected in a small but robust auction market for rare bottles of aged whisky, which have quietly gained the reputation of being a canny alternative investment.By comparison, the equivalent benchmark Live-ex Fine Wine 100 Index of resale prices was 10.4 percent higher over the corresponding period.\u201cScotch is a globally cherished drink, and the supply of rare bottles is diminishing because people actually drink it,\u201d said Andy Simpson, a co-founder of Rare Whisky 101.\u201cRarity drives the market, but it also keeps it small,\u201d added Mr. Simpson, who estimated the entire value of annual sales in the international retail and British resale market for collector-grade whisky at \u00a3100 million to \u00a3120 million. By comparison, international wine auctions in 2015 raised $346 million, according to an analysis by the Wine Spectator.Small-scale investors can get into the market for $500 to $5,000 for a bottle of potentially collectible whisky. Among the lots sold on Aug. 10 during a sale at the Glasgow auction house McTear\u2019s was a bottle of 1974 single malt from the Port Ellen distillery on Islay, which closed, or became what aficionados call \u201csilent,\u201d in 1983. The whisky, bottled by the Scottish retailers Gordon & MacPhail, sold for a hammer price of \u00a3400. In 2012, McTear\u2019s, which holds such sales 10 times a year, sold another bottle of the same Port Ellen vintage for \u00a3170, according to Rare Whisky 101.\u201cThe older and rarer it is, the better. And buy silent. Silent is golden,\u201d said Mr. Simpson, citing Port Ellen, Brora, Glenugie and Rosebank as defunct distilleries whose whiskies are now in vogue. He described collector-grade whisky as a \u201c10- to 20-year medium-term investment.\u201dThe high alcohol content of whisky, which ensures its longevity, makes old bottles less of a gamble than wine. The most expensive lot at McTear\u2019s was a Macallan 1938 with a handwritten label \u2014 exactly the sort of combination of age and quirkiness that might make a Bordeaux buyer nervous. It sold for \u00a35,500, above its high estimate of \u00a34,500.McTear\u2019s auction raised \u00a384,000 plus an additional \u00a320,000 in buyers\u2019 fees with about 95 percent of the lots selling, showing that whisky can be a consistent, if quiet, earner for a regional auction house.Whisky, like wine, is the type of commodity that lends itself to internet trading, and the vast majority of single malts auctioned in Britain are sold purely online.Like many online salesrooms, Scotch Whisky Auctions was reluctant to release the total and the success rate of their latest sale, which ended on Aug. 7, but three of the 4,198 lots sold for more than \u00a310,000, led by the \u00a317,500 paid for a presentation set of Mortlach 1939 \u2014 billed as the oldest single malt ever bottled. The sets were released by Gordon & MacPhail in 2015 in 100 specially commissioned crystal decanters, priced at \u00a320,000 each.Such limited-edition malts aimed at collectors form the apex of both the primary and secondary Scotch whisky markets. The Macallan,a Speyside distillery owned by the Edrington group since 1999, is the world\u2019s number one \u201csuper premium\u201d brand by value, according to International Wine and Spirits Research; it also represents about 25 percent of the auction market, according to Rare Whisky 101.In June, the Macallan released another collaboration with Lalique, \u201cThe Peerless Spirit,\u201d a 65-year-old single malt limited to 450 bottles and priced at $35,000 each.Geoff Kirk, the director of prestige at the Macallan, said that America and Asia were the biggest markets for the company\u2019s \u201cFine and Rare\u201d single malts.\u201cIn southeast Asia it\u2019s more about consumption than display,\u201d said Mr. Kirk, acknowledging that Scotch had yet to catch on in China the way it has in Japan and India, which both produce their own whiskies. \u201cCognac has been the spirit in China for the last 40 years. Corporate gift-giving was a huge part of the market.\u201dThe market for rare Scotch whisky, unlike that for France\u2019s most desirable wines, has not yet been galvanized \u2014 and destabilized \u2014 by speculative investment from China. This is partly because whisky, being more than 30 degrees proof, incurs high import duties and local taxes in Hong Kong and China.The star lot of the auction was a 50-year-old Macallan in a Lalique decanter, estimated at 280,000 to 320,000 Hong Kong dollars. It was released in 2005 in an edition of 470, priced at $5,995. It sold for 420,000 Hong Kong dollars, about $54,200, to a Hong Kong collector in the room, who paid a further 94,500 dollars in buyer\u2019s premium.\u201cOver the last year or so we have seen a new group of buyers from mainland China, America, Russia and southeast Asia,\u201d Mr. Lam said. \u201cThey\u2019re sensitive to price appreciation and want to look at other alternative investments.\u2019\u2019He said his first Hong Kong whisky auction, in 2009, offered just 40 lots and attracted only 15 interested bidders. They now attract more than 100 .Whisky may look like an attractive investment, but inexperienced buyers beware: Don\u2019t store bottles on their side like wine. The stronger alcohol content can rot the cork and make it leak.Then all the whisky will be good for is embrocating mules.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Leading the Edinburgh Fringe: \u2018I\u2019m Not Intimidated\u2019", "Date": "2016-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRunning the organization comes with significant responsibility, not to mention the weight of history. Though today there are Fringe festivals all over the world, the one in Edinburgh, which will celebrate its 70th anniversary next summer, is the true original.\u201cYou\u2019ll never even hear me say, \u2018Do you know what you really have to go and see \u2014 you shouldn\u2019t miss this one,\u2019 because we don\u2019t do that,\u201d Ms. McCarthy explained. \u201cWe promote the Fringe on behalf of everybody.\u201dMs. McCarthy grew up in a small town in Northern Ireland. (\u201cSeamus Heaney territory, you know? \u2018Little House on the Prairie\u2019 stuff. But I had an incredible art teacher and a brilliant English teacher, and I guess that was the starting point.\u201d) She went on to oversee various Irish arts festivals as well as Cinemagic, an international film festival for young people.In fact, she wasn\u2019t even job seeking when her current post opened up: \u201cBecause it was the Fringe, I thought, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m really interested.\u2019\u201dWhile High Street bustled, Ms. McCarthy, who seemed chipper, confident and serene, talked about her new position and future plans. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.What is it like to take over an organization that already has a staff, a structure and a history of success? It\u2019s a total luxury, because my previous experience has largely been setting things up from scratch. I keep kind of snickering to myself.I also have to say there\u2019s something very, very particular about the Edinburgh approach and the Scottish approach that I haven\u2019t found anywhere else. There\u2019s already such a sophisticated understanding of not just why initiatives like the festival are important for the economy, but also the intrinsic value of culture and the social impact that projects like this can have in terms of civic pride.You\u2019re coming in after years of steady growth in both number of productions and ticket sales. Are you intimidated about having to keep up the pace? I\u2019m not intimidated, and continuous growth is not our primary objective. The Edinburgh Festival Fringe should be whatever size it needs to be to accommodate the artists from all continents who want to have a voice here, and the venues who want to host them. So long as it continues to have that open-access principle at its core, then we will be doing our jobs.One thing about open access: You still have to be able to afford to participate. You\u2019ve said you intend to prioritize a hard look at affordability for artists. Any discoveries yet? All of that we\u2019re going to be really looking at post this year\u2019s festival. I wanted to get through my first Fringe before making any real judgments.But I know there are genuinely real barriers for people. I do think if we find that the range of accommodations and the cost of accommodations is becoming a significant barrier to people, particularly at the ground level \u2014 young people just trying to put on their first-ever show \u2014 we have some strategies and ideas that we will look at putting in place.But what can you do? Try to offer discounts? Build dorms? Definitely not build dorms. Something we are really interested in piloting next year: There are a lot of wealthy landowners in Edinburgh; people have houses and apartments across the city and those people could be persuaded to do a kind of \u2018adopt an artist\u2019 thing.What impact do you think Brexit might have on the Fringe? Everybody\u2019s really in the dark at the moment. The two things that we will keep a very close eye to are how it affects any of our potential backers, and then the other thing is, I guess just reputationally for the U.K. as a whole. I mean, could people say, \u2018Well, they didn\u2019t want to be a part of us, so. \u2026\u2019 I doubt that, because we\u2019ve always been very clear in our messaging that we are going to redouble our efforts to find pathways for artists from other parts of the world to come here.How do you plan to honor the festival\u2019s anniversary next year? There are three main tenets that we\u2019re building it around, and the first is reflection. Looking back at the founding principles, pulling out the stories of people who have come here and met here, and the stories of careers that have been launched and developed here. Then there\u2019s going to be the celebration of where we are now, so we\u2019re going to find ways to thank the city, thank the local people for being so supportive of this thing for 70 years.The third piece is going to be about looking forward and international connection. We\u2019re going to work with the other Fringes around the world to celebrate the moment of the birth of this concept in Edinburgh.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video Review: Decent Handling in a Toyota Prius? Yes, the New One", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDrivenEmbraced by progressives. Not terribly fashionable. Very popular in Vermont. It has long been the automotive equivalent of Bernie Sanders: the Toyota Prius.The new fourth-generation Prius has arrived, continuing the hybrid car\u2019s tradition of becoming stingier with gasoline than the previous version. A new Eco model even improves upon the E.P.A. fuel economy rating of 54 city, 50 highway by an average of 4 miles per gallon.But it\u2019s the design that gets the attention this time around.Prius has made the leap from cyborg armadillo to bionic koi, and the beholder will need to decide whether that\u2019s an improvement. My initial response was \u201cyikes\u201d \u2014 which seems to be the general reaction when people first spy it.After a week, my eye gradually and grudgingly has come to terms with what Toyota is trying to do, though larger wheels would help. I would take a pair of the snaking elongated taillamps in my house as art.If Prius doesn\u2019t look like a traditional car, it drives more like one now. It\u2019s quieter with reduced engine roar and less moaning and droning from the continuously variable transmission.This Prius sits on the Toyota New Global Architecture platform that the next-generation Camry will ride on. A new multilink rear suspension upgrades Prius\u2019s ride quality and handling to an average dynamic.The battery, moved from the cargo area to beneath the back seat, is a lithium-ion unit in all but the base model, which uses nickel-metal hydride. Total power output from the 1.8-liter 4-cylinder gas engine and two motor-generators is 121 horsepower, so acceleration from 0 to 60 remains in the leisurely 10-second range.The Prius does hybridy kinds of things. Coasting and braking charges the battery, and the gas engine shuts down at stoplights. Typically, the car initially pulls away on electric power before the gas engine smoothly feathers in. The EV Mode allows all-electric travel at low speeds for short distances. Using gauges on the improved LCD screen, drivers can track their fuel efficiency like a game (far safer than playing Pok\u00e9mon Go at the wheel).Fuel economy? Prius is the most efficient car you can buy without having to plug in (though the Prius Prime, a four-passenger plug-in version with an estimated all-electric range of 22 miles, is expected late this year). I\u2019m easily netting 52 miles per gallon without changing my driving habits. Impressive. Drive modes are available, but there\u2019s little difference among the three of them, including the Power mode.Regardless of color, cabin materials are a huge step up from the Rubbermaid-grade plastics in the departing model. Toyota\u2019s touch-screen user interface is straightforward, and a backup camera is standard. The LCD gauge cluster, which remains center mounted, gets mercifully better resolution, and a happy opening sequence plays when the car silently chirps to life.Not a small car, the Prius has a back seat that is fairly roomy, although very tall friends will want to ride up front. Two average-size adults will be very comfortable in the back, and three will be fine if the goal is not testing the Prius\u2019s estimated 588-mile range. The cargo hold is also relatively spacious.The list price begins at $25,035 for a Prius Two (there is no One). The Three model I tested, equipped with the Advanced Tech package that includes auto braking and pedestrian detection, had a sticker of $30,117.Prius remains the best way to save gas without having to plug in. Other than one\u2019s opinion on the sci-fi design, there\u2019s no question Toyota has improved the Prius experience all the way around.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.E., the 124-Year-Old Software Start-Up", "Date": "2016-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt may not qualify as a lightning-bolt eureka moment, but Jeffrey R. Immelt, chief executive of General Electric, recalls the June day in 2009 that got him thinking. He was speaking with G.E. scientists about new jet engines they were building, laden with sensors to generate a trove of data from every flight \u2014 but to what end?That data could someday be as valuable as the machinery itself, if not more so. But G.E. couldn\u2019t make use of it.But in 2011, G.E. also quietly opened a software center in San Ramon, Calif., 24 miles east of San Francisco, across the bay.Today one of San Ramon\u2019s most important projects is to build a computer operating system, but on an industrial scale \u2014 a Microsoft Windows or Google Android for factories and industrial equipment. The project is central to G.E.\u2019s drive to become what Mr. Immelt says will be a \u201ctop 10 software company\u201d by 2020.Silicon Valley veterans are skeptical.Many industries see digital threats, of course. Yet the scope of the challenge is magnified at G.E., a 124-year-old company and the nation\u2019s largest manufacturer, with more than 300,000 employees worldwide. Employees companywide have been making pilgrimages to San Ramon for technology briefings, but also to soak in the culture. Their marching orders are to try to adapt the digital wizardry and hurry-up habits of Silicon Valley to G.E.\u2019s world of industrial manufacturing.6 PhotosG.E.\u2019s success or failure over the next decade, Mr. Immelt says, depends on this transformation. He calls it \u201cprobably the most important thing I\u2019ve worked on in my career.\u201dApparently, there is no Plan B. \u201cIt\u2019s this or bust,\u201d he said.The march of digital technology \u2014 mainly inexpensive sensors, powerful computing and clever software \u2014 into the industrial world has been underway for years under the guise of \u201cthe internet of things\u201d or \u201cthe industrial internet.\u201d It is the next battlefield as companies fight to develop the dominant software layer that connects the machines.It promises to be a huge market for new products, improved service and efficiency gains in industries like energy, transportation and health care. By 2020, the industrial internet market will reach $225 billion, G.E. executives predicted in a recent meeting with analysts.So far, a major application has been predictive maintenance. Software analyzes the data generated by a machine to identify early warning signals that it needs repair, before it breaks down.The data volumes are exploding as machines new and old spawn sensors. By 2020, G.E. estimates that the data flowing off its machines in use will jump a hundredfold. That should enable far more detailed analysis, giving G.E. a chance to sell its customers not machines but \u201cbusiness outcomes,\u201d like fuel savings. Mr. Immelt sees this as a move up the industrial food chain.Yet all of this exposes G.E. to new competition beyond its traditional rivals like Rockwell Automation, Siemens and United Technologies. Tech giants, including Amazon, Cisco, Google, IBM and Microsoft also have their eye on the industrial internet market, as do a bevy of start-ups.There is precedent for trouble in other industries, of course. Google and Facebook transformed media and advertising, Amazon redefined retailing, and Uber applied an entirely new business model to taxis, which hadn\u2019t changed much in generations.\u201cThe real danger is that the data and analysis becomes worth more than the installed equipment itself,\u201d said Karim R. Lakhani, a professor at the Harvard Business School. \u201cG.E. has no choice but to try to do that itself.\u201dUntil this year, Darren Haas hadn\u2019t thought about G.E., certainly not working there. To him, G.E. meant little more than than kitchen appliances and light bulbs. \u201cI had no idea,\u201d Mr. Haas said.But he was intrigued after he met with Harel Kodesh, an expert in mobile and cloud computing who led teams at Microsoft and VMware, a maker of data-center software. Less than two years ago, Mr. Kodesh joined G.E., and he is now chief technology officer of GE Digital.That someone of Mr. Kodesh\u2019s caliber was a G.E. convert got Mr. Haas\u2019s attention. Then, Mr. Haas started grasping the role that G.E. equipment plays across the economy \u2014 in transportation, in hospitals \u2014 \u201ca whole world,\u201d he said. \u201cI found that really, really compelling.\u201dThe other thing Mr. Haas, 41, found appealing was the big computing challenge that lies ahead for the company. In May, he joined G.E. from Apple, where he was a member of the founding team at Siri, the voice-based digital assistant start-up Apple acquired in 2010. When he left Apple, Mr. Haas was head of cloud engineering, managing the computing engine behind Siri, iTunes and iCloud.At GE Digital, Mr. Haas has a similar title, head of platform cloud engineering, but in a different setting. He describes his job as applying modern software technology \u2014 machine learning, artificial intelligence and cloud computing \u2014 to the industrial arena. \u201cI\u2019ve got my work cut out for me,\u201d he said.Mr. Haas is working on the centerpiece of G.E.\u2019s software strategy, a product called Predix. Its evolution mirrors G.E.\u2019s software ambitions.Predix began as little more than a brand of software used by G.E. to service the gear it sells. One showcase use was in jet engines to do predictive maintenance, saving downtime. Around 2013, William Ruh, a former Cisco Systems executive brought in to put together the San Ramon software center, started expanding Predix to other G.E. industrial businesses.But that soon felt too small. The issue was \u201coutside disrupters,\u201d Mr. Ruh said, citing the online lodging start-up Airbnb as an example of rivals that can appear seemingly out of nowhere and that \u201cbring greater productivity \u2014 but don\u2019t own the assets they sell.\u201d G.E., Mr. Ruh notes, is the ultimate big-asset company.The other threat was rising interest among tech companies to take their internet connectivity expertise and try to apply it to industrial businesses. To get ahead of all this, G.E. reimagined Predix as a cloud-based operating system for industrial applications.Mr. Kodesh leads that effort. He ticks off the looming competitors: Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and others. \u201cThose companies are going to encroach on the territory,\u201d Mr. Kodesh said. \u201cAre we going to capitulate, or build something like Predix?\u201dThe basic idea is that G.E. and outside software developers will write programs to run on Predix. This software might, for instance, monitor the health and fine-tune the operation of equipment like oil-field rigs and wind-farm turbines, improving performance, reducing wear and adapting to changing environmental conditions. It amounts to software delivering the equivalent of personalized medicine for machines.Like any other computer operating system, Predix aims to take the complexity out of writing programs, so more people can create them. And while the instincts of the industrial world are proprietary, G.E. is following an open-source model with Predix, providing a basic design, but one open to outside contributors \u2014 more like Android from Google than Windows from Microsoft.Predix, Mr. Kodesh said, will be improved using the software equivalent of Lego blocks. \u201cSome will be G.E.\u2019s, and some will be made by third-party developers,\u201d he said.G.E. is betting that its deep knowledge of industry will give it an edge in this software arms race. The stakes for this kind of programming can be high.For a regular consumer using the internet, a misfiring algorithm in the software \u2014 \u201ca false positive\u201d \u2014 might mean a person sees an irrelevant online ad, or a bad Amazon book suggestion or Netflix movie recommendation, Mr. Kodesh said. Useless, perhaps, but not necessarily costly. But a false positive that prompts an airline to take a jet engine off the wing, Mr. Kodesh said, is a $100,000 mistake.\u201cWe really do need to have different technology, different algorithms and a different cloud, than in the consumer internet,\u201d he said.G.E. has set an ambitious target for Predix. It hopes to attract $100 million in orders this year, on its way to $4 billion in revenue by 2020. By then, the company forecasts that its total digital business \u2014 more than 90 percent of it software \u2014 may reach as much as $15 billion, up from $6 billion now.For Predix to reach its potential, though, G.E. needs outside programmers to write software for it. The company, with its deep pockets, can start the software-writing parade, but will others follow?This will be a major test. And G.E.\u2019s campaign to build an industrial operating system and create a flourishing ecosystem of software for it is just getting underway in earnest.In late July, G.E. hosted a Predix conference in Las Vegas, which attracted 1,200 software developers. Such developer gatherings are part of the playbook of every major software company but unusual for an industrial corporation.G.E. has some built-in advantages. Its installed base is huge. For example, the company says more than a third of the world\u2019s electricity is generated on G.E. equipment. It can make progress simply by winning over the aircraft makers, oil companies, hospitals and utilities that now depend on G.E. machinery.G.E. is starting to attract a developer following. Tata Consultancy Services, for one, says it now has 500 programmers designing and developing Predix applications for customers in the electric-utility, aviation and health care industries. G.E. also promotes partnerships with Infosys, Wipro and Capgemini to help business write Predix software.When he joined in 2011, Mr. Ruh had no illusions that making software a strength at a heavy-industry company would be easy. At the time, he told Mr. Immelt that would be \u201ca 10-year journey,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of that journey.\u201dPart of that is an effort to change an engineering culture that stretches back generations. \u201cIf G.E. is truly going to be a digital-industrial company, we can\u2019t be separate here,\u201d Mr. Ruh said of his software division. Digital \u201ctools and habits\u201d need to be embedded \u201cin how people do their jobs,\u201d he said.In its factory in Greenville, S.C., G.E. produces both giant power generators and evidence that this metamorphosis might work.The three-story building is crowded with immense cranes and milling, grinding and welding machines, overseen by manufacturing engineers and technicians. The finishing touches are being put on one of G.E.\u2019s new gas turbines.It looks like the business end of a rocket ship lying on its side, a gleaming steel dynamo at rest. It weighs 950,000 pounds. It fires up at nearly 2,900 degrees Fahrenheit, and it can generate enough electricity to supply more than 500,000 households.The gas turbine was brought to market in half the typical five years. That kind of accelerated product development is a performance that G.E. hopes to replicate across its industrial businesses. And it is a story of changes in design and manufacturing practices made possible by digital technology.John Lammas, the 56-year-old vice president for power generation engineering, started his working career 40 years ago, on the shop floor of a Rolls-Royce jet engine factory in Birmingham, England. He has been with G.E. for 31 years, moving up the ranks of the company\u2019s jet engine and power turbine divisions.\u201cI\u2019m an old mechanical guy,\u201d he said. But a couple of years ago, he issued an edict: no more paper drawings.In the past, a model of a new part would be made and then converted to detailed blueprints running to 70 pages or more. These would then be physically sent to G.E. manufacturing engineers and outside suppliers to begin setting up the tooling, casting and cutting for the part.This prototype-and-blueprint routine took up to eight weeks. Now, engineers use 3-D computer models, skip the prototype step and instantly send the models electronically.This goes a step beyond computer-aided design, which is commonplace. In Greenville, the designers are for the first time linked directly with manufacturers and suppliers in real time, in what G.E. calls a \u201cdigital thread.\u201d This means they can collaborate in ways that have changed the work process while making it more likely that problems or defects are spotted sooner.Traditionally, one set of engineers designed a part, and only then passed it on to manufacturing. If a problem arose on the supplier side, the design was kicked back and the process started over. \u201cJobs are combining in this digital world,\u201d Mr. Lammas said.Greenville\u2019s own equipment has been a Predix guinea pig. The machinery and factory were retrofitted with data-generating sensors and the software. Matt Krause, the plant manager, said that last winter, when a snowstorm shut the factory for a day, the sensor network detected that the plant had consumed 1,000 pounds of argon, an inert gas used in coatings for parts. The leak was fixed, saving $350,000 a year.\u201cWe can see things we never did before,\u201d Mr. Krause said. Over all, 60 of 200 steps in design and production have been automated or eliminated, reducing work time by 530,000 hours over three years, G.E. estimates.Not all the start-up ideas that G.E. is trying to breed translate comfortably to heavy industry. Lean proponents urge companies to come up with \u201cminimum viable products,\u201d particularly test versions of software programs. But no one wants a minimum viable jet engine or power generator.Yet in Greenville, engineers in the design stages are encouraged to move faster in smaller steps, conduct more experiments, and be willing to fail and try again. It amounts to a sea change in the engineering culture of heavy industry.\u201cAs an engineer, not getting it right the first time, I find painful,\u201d said Bill Byrne, an engineering manager. \u201cIt\u2019s uncomfortable. But it\u2019s been incredibly liberating.\u201dThe old ways, said Mr. Lammas, the engineering chief, had merit. Each step and rule was logical on its own. But the emphasis on flawless execution and perfection fostered a fear of failure. \u201cOvercoming that culture was probably the biggest challenge,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can I Put Down My Aging Pooch?", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe EthicistOur family dog, a 14-year-old terrier, is currently living with my wife and me in Paris. She has made the trans-Atlantic flight three times in the past year (crated in the belly of the plane) when we return home for various family events. The trip is stressful for her (and for me), but she has always rebounded quickly to her normal self, which is a pretty energetic and healthy dog. Recently, however, her health has declined a bit: less energy, hearing loss, brief moments of apparent confusion and an as-yet-unexplained brief seizure. But she is happy and devoted to my wife and me, enjoying meals and daily walks.We are traveling back to the United States soon, and she has been checked out by a vet and cleared to fly. My bigger concern is the return to Paris two months later. Even if her health remains visibly stable, she has clearly started what may be a slow decline. So at what point do I not subject her to the stress and risk of the flight? At what point do I reflect on her long and happy life and consider ending it peacefully at our home in America, where she grew up with my daughters, who are now in college? Right now, you\u2019re deciding whether to let your cousin continue to seek sympathy by misrepresenting the consequences of her own bad judgment while exposing other children to some hard-to-specify medical risks. Here\u2019s a third possibility: Tell her that she can\u2019t let her kids play with others without making sure their parents know the truth. Ask her to take responsibility, as she should have done all along. If she won\u2019t, go ahead and tell the other parents what you know.But I do hope you\u2019re not avoiding your family because you have conflicting views about money. You don\u2019t have to discuss your finances with them to keep in touch. Unless they or you have done something terrible to rupture your relationship, you have a connection with them that\u2019s morally significant. I\u2019d try to keep the two questions \u2014 money and relationship \u2014 separate, however hard that is in practice.A business contact recently shared with my husband that he enrolled his children in kindergarten at a very desirable public school outside his district by using a false address. Unknown to him, our child is wait-listed at this same school, for which we are zoned, as a result of the random lottery admissions process.Once private-school admissions and other alternative placements are completed, this public school\u2019s wait list will most likely clear, and my child and the rest of the wait-listed zoned students will receive a seat. However, other types of priority applicants \u2014 like siblings of current students whose families no longer live in the zone \u2014 may not.There\u2019s ample reason to want the best schooling you can swing for your kids. It can make them better able to enjoy and manage their lives and can help get them into a rewarding line of work. Many of these advantages are worth having in themselves. But some \u2014 the so-called positional goods \u2014 are valuable because they put you ahead of other people. Having great grades is usually a sign that you\u2019re profiting from your education, but it\u2019s also a help in getting the best further education and, in the end, the best jobs. So part of getting the best education for your kids really does mean getting them advantages over other kids. That excellent kindergarten is meant to set you up for success in all the schools that follow. Hence the cutthroat competition.People disagree about what it is for a society to be just. I believe that it requires the government to secure a decent education for all children, guarantee everyone a basic level of security and welfare and make sure that our economy is one in which everyone has a real shot at the most rewarding occupations. Some people on the right think this is asking too much; some on the left think we should ask for more. But there are things most of us can agree on. And one of them is that if we have fair rules that govern how we allocate resources \u2014 resources, like public schools, that are paid for and supported by all of us \u2014 then breaking those rules is unfair.We do a lousy job in our country of making sure that all kids get equal access to a good education. One reason is that we have wildly unequal schools \u2014 with easily identifiable differences in resources, teacher quality and the like. Given those differences, however, the sort of lottery you mention, among families who meet the residency requirement, is a reasonably fair way of allocating places. So it\u2019s just not O.K. to enter the lottery under false pretenses and take a slot that\u2019s rightfully someone else\u2019s.You might think it wasn\u2019t your business. But, given that this is a public school, that\u2019s not true. Nor is it unjust to pick on this indiscreet acquaintance, even if others are cheating this way. Otherwise we should never report anybody for any offense, because there\u2019s always going to be someone else who has gotten away with it. It\u2019s true that when the man told your husband what he\u2019d done, he surely assumed the information wouldn\u2019t be passed along. Not knowing anything about their relationship, I don\u2019t know why he thought this. Perhaps it was a simple misjudgment. If so, you should feel free to let the district know the truth \u2014 anony\u00admously, if the business relationship with your husband matters. There\u2019s enough unfairness around our educational system without people adding to it by deceit.Kwame Anthony Appiah teaches philosophy at N.Y.U.

{"Headline": "Olympic Spirit in Brazil? They Stoned the Torch Relay", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 How do Brazilians feel about their big Olympic moment?\u201cJust thinking of the Olympics leaves me revolted,\u201d said Ana Caroline Joia da Souza, 21, a street vendor who sells sweets in front of a Rio metro station. \u201cOur politicians want to trick the world into thinking things are great here. Well, let the foreigners see for themselves the filth we live in, the money our leaders steal.\u201dThe grim mood stands in stark contrast to the ebullience shown in 2009 when Rio landed the Olympics. At the time, Brazil was basking in its triumphs \u2014 including a growing presence on the world stage, the lifting of millions of poor people into the middle class and the maturing of its young democracy after 21 years of military rule that had ended in 1985.The leaders who envisioned the Olympics as an opportunity for Brazil to swagger in the international spotlight, including Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, the former president who has been one of Brazil\u2019s most influential political figures, are mired in scandals.Now Mr. da Silva\u2019s handpicked successor, Ms. Rousseff, faces an impeachment trial on claims that she manipulated the budget to conceal mounting economic problems. The scandals have developed against a backdrop of economic wretchedness: The unemployment rate surged to 11.3 percent in July, compared with 6.5 percent at the end of 2014, with companies laying off thousands of workers a day.In an effort to bolster security in Rio during the Games, the federal government is deploying thousands of troops to patrol the crime-weary city. But critics say that bringing in soldiers from violence-ravaged cities in northeast Brazil could embolden gang activity there and in other parts of the country.Challenges aside, some argue that the Olympics are just what Brazil needs to bring it out of its slump.Supporters say the traditional Olympic narrative often involves an escalation of tension before the Games, only to be replaced by excitement once they are underway. There are also those who say the country needs to stop complaining and start enjoying the spectacle.\u201cEveryone wanted the Games here when we got them, so all the criticism now is hypocritical,\u201d said Cleide Correa, 72, a real estate broker in Rio de Janeiro. \u201cOf course they spent a lot of money to organize this, but that\u2019s the case in every host country. We need to make the best of the situation now.\u201dThe International Olympic Committee, Mr. Paes said, \u201cis noting how we sell ourselves short.\u201d He argued that blame for the problems at the Olympic Village lay with an Argentina-born Olympic official, and contended that Brazilians were rapidly resolving the issues.Others say the country\u2019s merciless self-questioning at the moment holds a cathartic value, reflecting a democracy where freedom of expression remains resilient.Still, Ms. Brum said, it would be a joke to submit Brazil \u201cto the judgment of the so-called First World,\u201d given the number of recent problems in those countries and elsewhere.Ms. Brum mentioned Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union and Donald J. Trump\u2019s chances of becoming the president of the United States as evidence that rich industrialized countries, long seen by some Brazilians as admirable role models, might not have as many lessons to teach Latin America\u2019s largest country after all.The chances of the Olympics offering a distraction from Brazil\u2019s woes may be undermined by the country\u2019s own Olympic history. It has never won a medal of any sort at the Winter Games, and could win fewer medals at these Summer Games than nearly any host country in history.It is rare for the host team to finish outside the top 10 in the medal count, but Brazil has never finished better than 15th. At the 2012 Summer Games in London, British athletes won 65 medals, helping turn annoyance and outright anger over hosting the Olympics into a surge of national pride.Brazil, whose population is more than three times that of Britain, won just 17 medals in London. It was the most ever for Brazil, but placed it only 15th among competing countries, tied with Spain.Should Brazil finish 15th again, it would equal the home-country finishes of Greece (Athens, 2004) and Mexico (Mexico City, 1968). The only Summer Games host with a worse showing was Canada in 1976, when it won 11 medals in Montreal \u2014 none of them gold \u2014 and finished 27th in the medal count.Some Brazilians hope that home-field advantage, and the hundreds of millions of dollars invested in upgrading the country\u2019s sports programs, can push Brazil\u2019s total number of medals toward 30 and a finish in the top 10.It could get a boost from volleyball, judo and sailing, which are historically strong sports for the Brazilians. As for soccer, the state of the men\u2019s national team remains a touchy subject, after its humiliating loss to Germany during the 2014 World Cup, the last big sporting event that Brazil hosted.Brazil\u2019s malaise has some arguing for realistic expectations.\u201cWe\u2019re clearly not about to project an image of a powerful and efficient country,\u201d said Fernando Gabeira, a politician and writer.\u201cMaybe we can show how we\u2019re starting to get past our economic, political and moral disaster,\u201d Mr. Gabeira said. \u201cWe could be like those athletes who manage to finish the marathon with their tongues hanging out, almost fainting. But they make it to the finish line.\u201dJohn Branch and Mariana Sim\u00f5es contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Olympic Revelry Distracts Brazil (Momentarily) From Its Woes", "Date": "2016-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Brazil is in a terrible way: There is a Zika epidemic, the economy is in the toilet and a bare-knuckle brawl for the presidency has paralyzed the nation.But all of the bad news has been temporarily supplanted by an unexpected love affair with the Olympic Games, an event that has softened the hearts of even some of the most hardened cynics who now find themselves swooning with delight and national pride.\u201cWhat a shame I decided to take a vacation out of the city during this period,\u201d wrote Dora Kramer, a columnist for the newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo and a self-described Olympic pessimist.Like many critics, Ms. Kramer had complained that the Games were inappropriate for a city buckling under crime, rising unemployment and a fiscal crisis that has crippled schools, hospitals and local police departments.\u201cRio is a marvel,\u201d she wrote.The euphoria jumped a notch on Monday, when Brazil earned its first gold medal of the Games, in judo. For many, the pride was especially poignant because the winner, Rafaela Silva, is a black woman who grew up in the City of God, one of Rio\u2019s most impoverished favelas, or slums.\u201cEveryone in my neighborhood is filled with excitement, and people are just happier,\u201d said Fabio Costa dos Santos, 47, an unemployed City of God resident temporarily working at a Coca-Cola kiosk in the Olympic Village.But these and other episodes have so far failed to burst the celebratory bubble. In some two dozen interviews, many Rio residents and visitors from other parts of Brazil marveled at their government\u2019s ability to pull off a complex international sporting event without a serious mishap.Even with seven days to go before the closing ceremony, Brazilians said their fears of a terrorist attack have eased considerably. So, too, have worries that rampant street crime and transportation gridlock would mar the event and embarrass their country, the first in South America to host the Games.\u201cBefore they started, I thought the Olympics were only about construction noise, disruption and holes in the ground,\u201d said Marina de Souza Rolim, 91, a retired teacher and lifelong Carioca, as Rio residents are known. \u201cNow I can see this is a beautiful thing.\u201dThe shift in sentiment occurred overnight, inspired by an opening ceremony on Aug. 5 that was widely met with approval.It helps that expectations had been low, but many Brazilians said they were wowed by the parade of celebrities and well-crafted numbers that lionized the nation\u2019s rich history and exuberant culture.Even left-leaning naysayers were cheered by the nod to Brazil\u2019s stain of slavery, the paean to Rio\u2019s favelas and the appearances of Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil, musical giants who back Ms. Rousseff.Many were also proud that the ceremony was done on a shoestring, showcasing the Brazilian talent for gambiarra, the art of improvising on the cheap.On the night of the opening ceremony, an anti-Olympics protest that took place near the stadium ended violently, with the police lobbing tear gas at an unruly klatch of demonstrators.Carlos Henrique Carvalho Ferreira, 29, a doctoral student at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, said that he and many of his friends were initially opposed to the city\u2019s hosting the Olympics, but that he had a change of heart after unexpectedly landing cheap tickets to beach volleyball, field hockey and water polo events.\u201cWith so many tourists in the city, it feels like an extended holiday, yet it\u2019s been calmer than Carnival or New Year\u2019s Eve,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to enjoy the moment, but at the same time, we feel a bit guilty.\u201dAt a time of intense political polarization, with liberals and conservatives battling over the future of Ms. Rousseff, Brazilians say the Olympics have helped ease the divisions, even if temporarily.\u201cWe are in a very difficult and vulnerable moment right now, and these Olympic Games have united everyone,\u201d said Mariana Negrini, 42, who runs a small hotel in the interior state of Goi\u00e1s. \u201cInstead of us versus them, it feels as if we are one.\u201dThe Games have not won everyone over. Restaurant owners and street vendors, especially those far from the Olympic Village, have complained about disappointing sales. And poor Cariocas say they feel excluded by ticket prices that average between $60 and $110 \u2014 most likely a factor in the 1.1 million seats that remained unsold as of Monday.Others say the Games have fueled a rise in nationalist sentiment that often finds expression on social media. Leonardo Sakamoto, a liberal blogger, said he had become a pariah for maintaining his stance that the Olympics displaced far too many poor residents and that the government had failed to deliver on its promise to clean up Rio\u2019s sewage-laden waters.But most Brazilians are reveling in a singular moment that has allowed them to forget the growing inflation, rising unemployment and a staggering corruption scandal that continues to unfold.Although she has no money for tickets, Mayara Matheus da Fran\u00e7a Amorim, 27, an unemployed telecommunications analyst, said she was enjoying the free parties and the ebullient crowds of international visitors who have renewed her faith in a wounded nation.\u201cIt\u2019s reminded me how hospitable and friendly we are,\u201d she said amid the thrum of sidewalk buskers, carousing Europeans and start-up volleyball games on Copacabana Beach. \u201cAnd it lets me forget how tough my life is.\u201dBut soaring highs often give way to nasty hangovers. Last weekend, amid free-flowing cocktails at a hilltop mansion in the city\u2019s Santa Teresa neighborhood, Dudi Machado, an editor at large for Harper\u2019s Bazaar Brazil, said he was bracing for what will happen after the athletes and spectators go home.\u201cThe Olympics have given us hope in gloomy times, restored our pride and reminded us what we Brazilians are really good at,\u201d he said as the host, a prominent socialite, paraded through the crowd with an Olympic torch raised above her head. \u201cI\u2019m worried about the comedown because there\u2019s going to be a vacuum after this, and it\u2019s going to be bad.\u201dPaula Moura contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The international airport in Ezeiza is about an hour\u2019s drive, depending on traffic.MARKET OVERVIEWPuerto Madero is \u201ca very premium market, the most expensive and exclusive neighborhood in Buenos Aires,\u201d said Mercedes Ginevra, the owner of Ginevra Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.In May, the Related Group, a Miami-based developer, announced a large luxury project, SLS LUX Puerto Madero. Eighty percent of its 127 condo residences presold within four months, said Carlos Rosso, the president of condominium development for the Related Group. It is expected to be completed in 2019, he said. Prices range from the low $600,000s to $4 million.For foreign buyers, the Buenos Aires market generally ranges from $100,000 for a one-bedroom apartment in the Recoleta neighborhood up to $9 million for a villa in Barrio Parque, the most exclusive section of Palermo Chico, Ms. Ginevra said.Historically, Argentina has had a \u201cboom and bust economy\u201d with some strong growth periods followed by downturns, Mr. Faigenbaum said. When real estate prices decreased significantly in 2002-2003, after a recession and a currency devaluation, \u201cmany foreigners and Americans came to Buenos Aires to buy real estate, because prices were really low.\u201dTo protect their savings, Argentines bought apartments. Real estate \u201cproved to be a reliable asset,\u201d especially in Buenos Aires, Mr. Faigenbaum said, with prices increasing steadily until 2014.Last year\u2019s presidential election \u201ccreated a pause in the price increase in the real estate market,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are moving to a more rational real estate market with prices more related to people\u2019s incomes and people\u2019s ability to buy.\u201dSince a new president, Mauricio Macri, took office in December, \u201cthe market is going well,\u201d said Ms. Ginevra of Sotheby\u2019s.Damian Tabakman, dean of the EN Real Estate School of Business in Buenos Aires, said in an email in Spanish that during the previous administration of Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, the country was isolated from the world. Under the new Macri government, things have started to change, he said, and foreign investors are starting to look at opportunities in Argentina.WHO BUYS IN BUENOS AIRESAbout 10 percent of buyers are foreigners, some from Switzerland, Belgium and other European countries, Ms. Schmiegelow said. American buyers from Florida often have family in Argentina. Others come from New York, Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles, Mr. Faigenbaum said. International buyers are often drawn to Recoleta, a \u201cvery traditional, very upscale neighborhood,\u201d Mr. Faigenbaum said.BUYING BASICSBuying a home in Buenos Aires as a foreigner is \u201cpretty easy,\u201d Mr. Faigenbaum said, with regulations but no restrictions. There are some restrictions in Argentina for properties on a lake or close to a border.Dollars, not pesos, are used for pricing and transactions.Most transactions are generally cash, with mortgages scarce. In the last three months, banks have launched a few credit lines for local buyers, Mr. Faigenbaum said. About 10 percent of transactions include a mortgage, he said.Buyers can consult an outside lawyer, \u201cbut it is not necessary,\u201d Ms. Ginevra said, noting that in her office, an in-house lawyer writes the contract. A notary checks title and transfers the deed.\u201cIt is a pretty good, solid system,\u201d Mr. Faigenbaum said. \u201cYou can be 100 percent sure you will be the sole owner of the property, and it will be clear.\u201dWEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCIESSpanish; Argentine peso (1 peso = $0.068)TAXES AND FEESBuyers need to budget about 4.5 percent of the purchase price for closing costs including notary fees, property registration and stamp duties. The real estate commission for buyers is 4 percent plus 21 percent tax. Sellers pay a 2 percent commission plus tax, Ms. Schmiegelow said.Property taxes on this apartment total $7,200 a year. The monthly maintenance is $2,633 and includes security and use of amenities like the pools.CONTACT An earlier version of this article misstated the number of condominiums in the SLS LUX Puerto Madero project.

{"Headline": "How Much Is Donald Trump Hurting the G.O.P.? Here\u2019s a Way to See", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 2016 RaceAnother way to see what is being called the Trump Tax is to look at polling\u2019s generic ballot question: It asks people whether they would vote for the Democrat or the Republican, with no declaration of the identity of those people.In the winter and spring of 2016, Republicans who were fans of Ted Cruz or John Kasich might have conjured up thoughts of a general election in November with Mr. Cruz or Mr. Kasich on the ballot \u2014 not one in which Mr. Trump was the nominee. These voters would have answered the generic ballot question with their favorite candidate in mind.When it grew clear that Mr. Trump was likely to be the party\u2019s candidate, it became harder for these voters to imagine someone other than him on the ballot when faced with the generic question. That\u2019s why data on this question give us a different kind of glimpse at the tax Mr. Trump is levying on the G.O.P.The change in results on the generic ballot question for the 2016 race reveals an interesting pattern. Data from YouGov, an online polling organization, show that once Mr. Trump began to dominate the Republican primaries in March and a concerted effort by the other candidates began \u2014 and then failed \u2014 there was a significant shift in the generic ballot results.The Upshot\u2019s presidential forecast, updated daily.From autumn 2015 to spring 2016, the Republican was beating the Democrat in the generic ballot question. In January 2016, for example, the spread was seven points \u2014 39 percent for the Democrat and 46 percent for the Republican. As it became clear that Mr. Trump would be the nominee, the pattern changed and the Democratic candidate went ahead. By the end of July, the Democrat had 44 percent and the Republican 36 percent.One way to view this reversal is as the price for nominating Mr. Trump.Similar trends do not appear to be at work on the generic ballot for the House of Representatives, suggesting two things. First, Mr. Trump\u2019s unpopularity has not affected down-ballot races to the same degree that it has his own race. Second, the trend among the presidential race is not a general anti-Republican sentiment. It is actually something specific about his campaign and most likely about him.It\u2019s also possible, but less likely, that the change in the generic vote question is less about Mr. Trump and more about Mrs. Clinton, or more specifically, her primary opponent, Bernie Sanders. Perhaps during the Democratic primaries some independent voters thought Mr. Sanders might be the nominee, leading them to hold back from supporting the Democratic candidate until they were sure it would be Mrs. Clinton. If this were the case, however, the switch in the generic vote matchup would probably have happened later in the year when the Democratic contest was winding down.The Upshot\u2019s Senate election forecast for 2016, updated daily with the latest polls.What\u2019s especially striking is that the negative reaction to Mr. Trump by many Republican voters comes largely from his strident language in separating people into \u201cin\u201d and \u201cout\u201d groups based on race and ethnicity.Given that they want to win elections more than anything else, parties rarely make catastrophic mistakes in nominating candidates for president. Because of that, it is easy to believe that who the candidates are and what they say has little effect on presidential election outcomes, especially in this period of heightened partisanship and party sorting.But they do. Just because we rarely see it doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t real.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "War and Pillaging Couldn\u2019t Break an Afghan Village, but a Tumbling Economy May", "Date": "2016-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIstalif JournalISTALIF, Afghanistan \u2014 To survive the last catastrophe, when their town was sacked and burned by the Taliban, the potters of the northern Afghan town of Istalif buried the tools of their trade and fled, some enduring years of exile until the threat finally passed.The town has long been coveted for its rustic, riverine beauty, nestled among bands of orchards that overlook the parched Shomali Plain, and for its strategic location on the road to Kabul, the capital. Istalif\u2019s resurgence after the fall of the Taliban in 2001 hardened its reputation for resilience, earned over centuries as it repeatedly survived pillaging by invaders.Yet now, Istalif is endangered again, and the peril this time is more difficult to escape: imposed not by marauders but by neglect, as Afghanistan\u2019s government grapples with accelerating violence and a collapsing economy, and as the foreign presence evaporates.Afghans who picnicked by Istalif\u2019s river or visited its famous shrine have stopped coming because of growing insecurity across the country. With unemployment chronically high, those who do visit spend little on the town\u2019s distinctive turquoise pottery or the mass-produced knickknacks that shopkeepers hawk to survive.Gone, too, are the foreigners who descended on the village over the last decade, sometimes on day trips from Kabul, flush with cash. The offices of various international organizations that sought to aid the town and its residents have been forsaken, as they have across much of the country, leaving behind only rusted signs detailing the foreigners\u2019 lofty and now discarded ambitions.In lettering faded by the sun, one sign for a Belgian group called Mothers for Peace advertises projects including English and literacy courses, a mothers-and-children clinic, agriculture education and a \u201cpottery section.\u201d Beyond the sign, a padlocked and emptied building is a vestige of passing Western interest in this place.The shops on Istalif\u2019s main street were open on a recent morning, but devoid of shoppers. \u201cI have forgotten what a dollar looks like,\u201d said Mir Golom Rasool, a 70-year-old store owner \u2014 exaggerating for effect, but only a little.A different nonprofit founded by an American couple provided financing for the restoration of more than 100 shops in Istalif, and by 2007, news reports were hailing the town as an Afghan success story.But even as development improved people\u2019s lives, one of the town\u2019s foundations \u2014 its centuries-old pottery production \u2014 was struggling. In recent years, the local market for pottery had been \u201cobliterated,\u201d Mr. Liddle said. \u201cHardly any foreigners go there, and fewer Afghans.\u201dTurquoise Mountain, which once had a branch in Istalif, is still trying to connect the town\u2019s craftspeople with international markets, and recently included its pottery in a landmark exhibition at the Smithsonian Institution \u2014 where their wares were the best-selling items, Mr. Liddle said.But of the various Afghan crafts the group was trying to promote, including jewelry and woodwork, \u201cceramics is the most challenging one and the hardest to commercialize internationally,\u201d because of the difficulty in shipping delicate pieces and ensuring that the quality of the pottery is up to the high standards of buyers in London or New York, Mr. Liddle said.The loss of business seemed an especially cruel turn for a place that had managed to survive far more crippling shocks.Mohamed Islam Malekzada, who manages a pottery business started by his grandfather and spoke in his shop on the main street, spent years in a Taliban prison after the insurgents raided Istalif in the late 1990s. He was rounded up with other residents and beaten \u201cafter they burned our homes,\u201d he said.\u201cIt was a very dark era,\u201d he said.The family returned to Istalif after the fall of the Taliban and revived their pottery business, with help from Turquoise Mountain, which worked to improve the quality of the ceramics and revived a distinct, natural glaze \u2014 measures that were supposed to help Istalif\u2019s craftspeople market their wares abroad.Yet Mr. Malekzada said he hardly ever received international orders. \u201cThere was one shipment to America, for 25 pieces, about two months ago,\u201d he said. With international support drying up, Afghanistan\u2019s government had not jumped in to support the struggling pottery industry, he said.As he spoke, a family stopped by, browsing past the pricier pottery before settling on a large, unglazed pot that cost less than a dollar.\u201cWe are not going to give up,\u201d Mr. Malekzada said. \u201cWe kept the business in bad days, and we will keep going as long as we can.\u201dIn his book \u201cBazaar Politics: Power and Pottery in an Afghan Market Town,\u201d Noah Coburn, an anthropologist who spent several years working and living in Istalif, described the central role of pottery production in the town and on local politics.It \u201cshaped the rhythm of life for the potters\u201d by requiring a high level of integration in families and collective labor, he wrote. That, in turn, \u201cencouraged loyalty and hierarchy.\u201dBy contrast, the foreign nongovernmental organizations that worked in Istalif had little impact, \u201cdespite large amounts of money being spent,\u201d Mr. Coburn wrote.Across the street from Mr. Malekzada\u2019s stall, another shopkeeper, Abdul Jabar, was also trying to seize any opportunity, handing a young man a small clay pot that the boy said he needed to feed his partridge, on the promise that the boy\u2019s father would pay later.Abdul Jabar traced the history of Istalif through Afghanistan\u2019s recent eras, recalling the Taliban occupation, when he hid in Kabul, moving from house to house until he was able to restart his business. Years later, the town prospered as Afghanistan became more secure, and \u201cpeople would come from all over the country for picnics,\u201d he said.Now, like other potters on the street, Abdul Jabar and his family are suffering, contending with the resurgence of the Taliban and a broader sense that the country \u2014 or his corner of it \u2014 had been abandoned. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get the help we expected,\u201d he said, reflecting on the role of foreign groups in Istalif. And the government, he added, \u201chad failed to do anything good.\u201dAcross the street, men cooled ceramics in a pink bucket filled with water, their work rhythms continuing, even without the shoppers, as they had for generations.\u201cWe don\u2019t know what else to do,\u201d Abdul Jabar said.Jawad Sukhanyar contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pregnant Women Advised to Avoid Travel to Active Zika Zone in Miami Beach", "Date": "2016-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMIAMI BEACH \u2014 With the Zika virus spreading to Miami Beach, federal health officials on Friday advised pregnant women not to visit a 20-block stretch of one of the country\u2019s most alluring tourist destinations. They also told them to consider postponing travel anywhere in Miami-Dade County.The escalation of the Zika crisis here sent tremors through South Florida\u2019s vibrant tourist industry and stoked the fears of pregnant women, worried about the virus\u2019s ability to cause severe brain damage in newborn babies.The travel advisory from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was prompted by the discovery of a second zone of local Zika transmission in an area between Eighth and 28th Streets in Miami Beach that includes the heart of South Beach, a tourist mecca. Officials said five people, including travelers from New York, Texas and Taiwan, were infected there. The other area where mosquitoes are spreading the virus is in the Miami neighborhood of Wynwood, a hip, gentrifying arts district.Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the C.D.C. director, warned at a news briefing on Friday that more cases of local Zika transmission are likely to emerge in the other parts of the county. The agency he leads said in a statement that because so many people infected with Zika have no symptoms, because the virus can incubate for two weeks and because diagnosis of cases can take several weeks, \u201cit is possible that other neighborhoods in Miami-Dade County have active Zika transmission that is not yet apparent.\u201dA skillful piece of detective work by health officials led them to zero in on Miami Beach on Thursday morning after they spotted an announcement from Taiwan about a woman there who was infected with Zika and had visited Miami Beach, said Dr. Lyle R. Petersen, who is managing the C.D.C.\u2019s Zika response. Before that, he said, health officials were investigating a few cases of infected people who had been in Miami Beach, but had also been other places. The Taiwanese woman, in contrast, had stayed near her hotel on Miami Beach throughout her visit, enabling them to establish where she was infected. The other four people had all been in the same vicinity.Combating the virus and the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that carry it will not be an easy task on Miami Beach, health officials warned. The county has successfully used aerial spraying to combat mosquitoes in the Wynwood neighborhood, but will not be able to use that tactic in Miami Beach because of its high-rises and high winds, Dr. Frieden said. South Beach also attracts big crowds of revelers and beachgoers who are juicy targets for mosquitoes. And there is the swimsuit factor.\u201cWe don\u2019t think our advice to wear long sleeves and long pants is likely to be widely followed in some of these areas,\u201d Dr. Frieden said.Health officials have been predicting for months that Zika would arrive in the continental United States, especially in warm mosquito havens like Florida. And despite Friday\u2019s developments, they said they remain confident that the virus will not turn into a major epidemic in the continental United States as it has across Latin America and the Caribbean. The widespread use of air-conditioning and window screens helps reduce the risk of mosquito bites.The vast majority of Zika cases have been and will continue to be in people who have traveled to the other countries where the virus has spread widely, or have had sexual relations with someone who traveled to those places, officials said. There have been 2,260 cases of Zika reported in the continental United States and Hawaii, including 529 in pregnant women, the C.D.C. said Friday.So far, 36 cases of locally transmitted Zika have been identified, all in Florida, and 25 of them are linked to an area around two small businesses in Wynwood, north of downtown Miami. On Aug. 1, the C.D.C. advised pregnant women not to travel to a one-square-mile area in Wynwood. And while Gov. Rick Scott and the Florida Health Department have announced that 17 blocks of that area have been found to be clear of Zika transmission, the C.D.C. maintains that the one-square-mile section should still be considered an active Zika zone, Dr. Petersen said.Mr. Scott also struck a different note from the federal health officials about the risks of Zika posed to Miami-Dade County, a sprawling multicultural metropolis of 2.7 million people. He minimized the extent of the spread, saying in a news conference, \u201cWe have two small areas. One less than a mile, and we\u2019ve already been able to reduce the footprint. We have another area now that\u2019s 1.5 miles on Miami Beach. That\u2019s out of a state that takes 15 hours to drive from Key West to Pensacola, so let\u2019s put things in perspective.\u201dHis communications director, Jackie Schutz, said Friday that Mr. Scott \u201cis encouraging people to come to Miami, to come to South Beach. Just remove standing water and wear bug spray.\u201dBut Dr. Frieden noted that there have been several other cases of suspected local transmission in Miami-Dade County that are believed to be isolated cases. Other cases will likely crop up, he said.\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is stepping back and saying there have been now multiple areas of individual transmission,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a large county. There are more than two million people there, more than 20,000 pregnant women. We would always err on the side of caution.\u201dThe C.D.C. generally must defer to state officials to decide where to set the boundaries around an area of potential disease transmission and what travel warnings to issue, federal officials and health experts said.\u201cThe state has authority within its borders and it takes advice and counsel from the C.D.C.,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, head of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University\u2019s medical school.The realization that Miami Beach was a zone of Zika transmission was triggered by a news release from Taiwan that C.D.C. officials noticed on Wednesday, Dr. Petersen said. Taiwan\u2019s Center for Disease Control reported that a 44-year-old woman who visited Miami for business in early August, sought medical treatment for a rash on her legs and abdomen. The woman, who is not pregnant, tested positive for Zika.\u201cWe tried repeatedly to get in touch with Taiwan the minute we heard about this,\u201d Dr. Petersen said. With the time difference, C.D.C. officials were not able to talk to Taiwanese officials until 6 a.m. Thursday. What they learned, he said, \u201c provided pretty strong evidence that these other people who had gone to multiple places\u201d including Miami Beach, had probably been infected there.Although the four other people had not stayed in the same hotel, he said, the places they had visited in Miami Beach \u201cclustered in a fairly tight area.\u201dSo far, local leaders and people involved in tourism said they have not seen panic, though there is concern.Mapping where Zika infections have been reported.But, she said, \u201cI have received emails from women saying that they are pregnant or thinking about getting pregnant, and are concerned about coming to Miami, and I am happy to give them a refund and also to anyone else who wants one.\u201dJosh Alexander, a travel specialist at the New York City-based Protravel International, said that clients have been canceling their plans.\u201cThey don\u2019t want to go anywhere near Florida in general,\u201d he said. \u201cI have had cancellations to the Florida Keys and am getting calls from families who are booked to go to Disney in December.\u201dAnd Mayor Carlos A. Gim\u00e9nez of Miami-Dade County, said \u201cI\u2019m concerned about the impact on the economy, and I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t.\u201dAlthough many elected officials fretted Friday about the potential economic consequences of the virus\u2019s spread, some said public health must come before tourism, among them Mayor Cindy Lerner of Pinecrest, a village of 19,000 people in Miami-Dade County.\u201cI think all of us are holding our breath and crossing our fingers that it doesn\u2019t continue to expand,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t build a wall or a net.\u201dLizette Alvarez reported from Miami Beach, and Pam Belluck from New York.

He has created two dozen national monuments, more than any previous president, ranging from small sites like the Stonewall Inn, a gay rights landmark in Manhattan, to more than 300,000 acres in the mountains east of Los Angeles.Roxanne Quimby, a founder of Burt\u2019s Bees, had been buying property in northeastern Maine for years and accelerated her purchases after selling the company in 2007. But she stoked the anger of Maine residents by closing off the land to hunting and snowmobiling. When she announced plans to turn it into a national park, the idea ran into fierce opposition.Her son, Lucas St. Clair, took over the campaign, allowing hunters and snowmobilers to return to part of the area. He and Obama administration officials pledged that the land would remain open to recreation if it was given to the government. The family donated $20 million for park development and maintenance, and pledged another $20 million. After it became clear that Congress would not approve a national park, conservation groups lobbied the administration for a national monument designation.Mr. St. Clair won over some former opponents, but resistance has remained strong. In a struggling region that has long relied on shrinking timber-related businesses, many residents fear that a national monument could eventually mean new air pollution controls on wood and paper mills in the surrounding areas.\u201cIt\u2019s sad that rich, out-of-state liberals can team up with President Obama to force a national monument on rural Mainers who do not want it,\u201d Gov. Paul LePage, a Republican, said in a statement. Earlier this year, the state Legislature passed and Mr. LePage signed a bill opposing the federal takeover.The president\u2019s action drew sharply differing statements from the state\u2019s United States senators, who joined forces last year to express concern about the idea.Senator Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, said that commitments from the administration persuaded him that \u201cthe benefits of the designation will far outweigh any detriment.\u201d He said the monument could coexist with the wood and paper industry, \u201cand will provide much-needed diversity to the region\u2019s economy.\u201dBut Senator Susan Collins, a Republican, said Mr. Obama should not have acted on his own, \u201cgiven the objection lodged by the Maine Legislature, the lack of consensus among Mainers who live in the area, and the absence of congressional approval.\u201dThe new national monument, carved by wild rivers and mountain ridges, is home to a wide range of animals, including moose, bobcats, bald eagles, salmon and Canada lynx.\u201cAs we see visitation grow, with people from around the country and around the world, it will settle in that this truly is a special landscape and the economic benefits can be realized,\u201d Mr. St. Clair said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the only monument that has been criticized, and our governor isn\u2019t the only governor who has criticized a monument. From the Grand Tetons to the Everglades, it\u2019s a theme in the creation of these parks. But I think time will help heal these divisions.\u201dKatharine Q.

{"Headline": "Tim Kaine Says Hillary Clinton Has Learned From Email \u2018Mistake\u2019", "Date": "2016-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI know that this is something that she\u2019s learned from, and we\u2019re going to be real transparent, absolutely,\u201d Mr. Kaine said.Mrs. Clinton made her first apologies roughly a year ago and has promised to be more open, yet she was criticized for going more than 200 days without holding a formal news conference until Friday, when she took questions from reporters in Washington.Asked which candidate was more honest and trustworthy, 49 percent of respondents chose Mrs. Clinton and 40 percent chose Mr. Trump, while the margin was narrower \u2014 46 percent to 43 percent \u2014 among registered voters. Both results were Mrs. Clinton\u2019s best against Mr. Trump since the poll started asking the question in May, according to a news release accompanying the poll.Mrs. Clinton holds a lead of eight percentage points among registered voters over all, according to the poll, and has improved markedly with college-educated white women \u2014 a group that Democrats have struggled to win for decades. But she continued to fare poorly among white men without college degrees.Mr. Manafort said on Fox\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d that the general election was just starting and that Mr. Trump would focus on attacking Mrs. Clinton starting on Monday with an economic speech in Detroit.\u201cThe campaign is a three-month campaign \u2014 we\u2019re at the beginning,\u201d Mr. Manafort said. \u201cStarting Monday, we\u2019re going to be announcing our economic plan. When we do that, we\u2019re comfortable that we can get the agenda and the narrative of the campaign back on where it belongs, which is comparing the tepid economy under Obama and Clinton versus the kind of growth economy that Mr. Trump wants to build.\u201dPerhaps Mr. Kaine\u2019s most surprising comments were about the fate of Judge Garland. He and Mrs. Clinton strongly support Judge Garland\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court, but the judge\u2019s future remains unclear in the Republican-controlled Senate. If the Senate does not act on Judge Garland, and Mrs. Clinton becomes president in January, she would have to decide whether to stick with the choice of Mr. Obama, her close ally, or to pick someone else for the vacancy.Mr. Kaine, who represents Virginia in the Senate, said the fate of Judge Garland \u201cwill be for the president and the president-elect to decide,\u201d adding that it was up to Republicans in control of the Senate to bring the nomination to a vote. Asked if it was a 100 percent certainty that Mrs. Clinton would stick with Judge Garland\u2019s nomination if she were elected, Mr. Kaine sidestepped the question and said that the onus was on Republicans to hold a vote and that he would vote in favor of the nomination.On Syria, Mr. Kaine said he believed the Obama administration had sent \u201ca mixed message\u201d about whether President Bashar al-Assad had to be deposed after crossing Mr. Obama\u2019s so-called red line forbidding Syria to use chemical weapons. Still, Mr. Kaine said he supported the administration\u2019s decision not to focus on ousting or replacing Mr. Assad and instead to concentrate on battling the Islamic State in Syria and elsewhere.On CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, who challenged Mr. Trump for the Republican nomination and has refused to endorse him, ruled out voting for Mrs. Clinton in November, as some Republicans have said they would do. But asked if he would vote for Mr. Trump, Mr. Kasich said, \u201cI wish that I could be fully enthusiastic \u2014 I can\u2019t be \u2014 so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in the end.\u201dHe also said he did not know if Mr. Trump could win Ohio in November \u2014 a key state in his electoral strategy \u2014 if Mr. Trump continued to make controversial comments. \u201cI still think it\u2019s difficult if you are dividing to be able to win in Ohio,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s really, really difficult.\u201dHe added: \u201cI was never interested in being anyone\u2019s vice president. Never considered it. Why would I want to be? I would be the worst vice president. I have too many opinions.\u201dThe Trump campaign has disputed details about the call, and Mr. Trump has said he never offered the vice-presidential position to Mr. Kasich.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bankruptcy for Banks: A Sound Concept That Needs Fine-Tuning", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother ViewThe House of Representatives is pushing to enact a bankruptcy act for banks.It has passed a bankruptcy-for-banks bill, sent it to the Senate, and now embedded it in its appropriations bill, meaning that if Congress is to pass an appropriations bill this year, it may also have to enact the bankruptcy-for-banks bill.Is that a good idea?In concept, bankruptcy for banks makes sense: Why should they get the benefits of government bailouts that industrial companies rarely receive? The answer usually is that a bank failure can bring down the economy, while an industrial failure cannot. But if banks can be reorganized in bankruptcy, the possibility of a win-win result is in the cards. We could restructure a big bank to stop it from damaging the economy, but without having to bail it out.The two of us support this concept \u2014 and indeed one of us worked extensively with the Hoover Institution to draft such a bankruptcy proposal. But the bill in play has several dangerous features that could make bailouts more likely, not less likely.First and most problematic, only the bank and not the regulator can make the bankruptcy happen. If the regulators think that a bankruptcy is needed, but that a bailout or alternative resolution process is not needed, they cannot directly force a filing.Typically, creditors of a failing company can force a bankruptcy and the United States is effectively a major creditor for banks \u2014 guaranteeing deposits and more. Earlier bankruptcy-for-banks proposals had the regulators able to put a big troubled bank into bankruptcy, but the House bill mistakenly does not. Regulators can resolve banks under the Dodd-Frank Act, but can do so only under specific conditions that may take time to invoke.True, regulators can pressure bank managers to reluctantly file, but the regulators may have to concede conditions to bank executives to make them file quickly; if the bank does not file quickly, the regulators may decide that to save the economy, they have to bail the bank out. In the extreme case, bank management may just refuse to file for bankruptcy.Second, the bill broadly exempts bank executives from lawsuits and liability for pre-bankruptcy actions. Banking law anticipates that bank officers and directors could be held personally liable for gross negligence in mismanaging the bank. With executives fearing lawsuits, the thinking was that they would run risky, wobbling banks more soundly. The House bill exempts bankers from liability not just for the actual filing for bankruptcy \u2014 an exemption needed to encourage them to file voluntarily when needed, and which we support \u2014 but also for any actions taken \u201cin connection with\u201d the filing.As lawyers know, the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d has no sharp boundary; it could readily shield the bankers from liability for serious errors that made the filing necessary. After all, \u201ceverything is connected to everything.\u201dThird, the bankruptcy bill contemplates only one kind of bankruptcy: one where all of the bank\u2019s derivatives contracts and short-term funding, or repo, are fully paid off, with longer-term creditors being hit to support the short-term debt. This mechanism is potentially a good way to restructure a failed bank and stop a run on the banking industry more broadly. Today\u2019s bankruptcy law allows those with derivatives and repo contracts with the bank to terminate them as soon as the bank files for bankruptcy. This wide termination when Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in 2008 caused havoc in financial markets around the world.The House bill is putting all its bets on this mechanism of fully paying off derivatives and repos in a 48-hour bankruptcy. But such a rapid-fire bankruptcy has never before been tried, and under the bill, it must be completed in 48 hours \u2014 faster than almost any bankruptcy on record.As military generals know, no battle plan survives first contact with the enemy; and as financial policy makers in and out of Congress should understand, no financial plan will survive first contact with a crisis. A viable bankruptcy structure needs to have a backup to the House bill\u2019s near-overnight restructuring plan, because it may not work. One piece that is needed, in case a quick bankruptcy does not work, is a mechanism to smoothly disassemble a supposedly \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d bank so that it does not drag the economy down with it. That would need a provision preventing the bank\u2019s creditors from terminating its derivatives and short-term funding contracts until the derivatives book can be disassembled in an orderly way and the short-term financing wound down.The good news is that the core concept behind the bill \u2014 bankruptcy for banks \u2014 is sound. Although the problems we outlined are fundamental, they can be fixed with more thought and straightforward changes. But if these adjustments are not made, the system would depend on a quick bankruptcy that might not work. If it does not, we fear that the House\u2019s proposed bankruptcy bill would then leave only one alternative for the regulators: to bail out the failed bank and its executives.Mark J.

{"Headline": "How Russia Often Benefits When Julian Assange Reveals the West\u2019s Secrets", "Date": "2016-08-31", "News": "American officials say Mr. Assange and WikiLeaks probably have no direct ties to Russian intelligence services. But the agendas of WikiLeaks and the Kremlin have often dovetailed.Supported byJulian Assange was in classic didactic form, holding forth on the topic that consumes him \u2014 the perfidy of big government and especially of the United States.Notably absent from Mr. Assange\u2019s analysis, however, was criticism of another world power, Russia, or its president, Vladimir V. Putin, who has hardly lived up to WikiLeaks\u2019 ideal of transparency. Mr. Putin\u2019s government has cracked down hard on dissent \u2014 spying on, jailing, and, critics charge, sometimes assassinating opponents while consolidating control over the news media and internet. If Mr. Assange appreciated the irony of the moment \u2014 denouncing censorship in an interview on Russia Today, the Kremlin-controlled English-language propaganda channel \u2014 it was not readily apparent.Now, Mr. Assange and WikiLeaks are back in the spotlight, roiling the geopolitical landscape with new disclosures and a promise of more to come.United States officials say they believe with a high degree of confidence that the Democratic Party material was hacked by the Russian government, and suspect that the codes may have been stolen by the Russians as well. That raises a question: Has WikiLeaks become a laundering machine for compromising material gathered by Russian spies? And more broadly, what precisely is the relationship between Mr. Assange and Mr. Putin\u2019s Kremlin?From the outset of WikiLeaks, Mr. Assange said he was motivated by a desire to use \u201ccryptography to protect human rights,\u201d and would focus on authoritarian governments like Russia\u2019s.But a New York Times examination of WikiLeaks\u2019 activities during Mr. Assange\u2019s years in exile found a different pattern: Whether by conviction, convenience or coincidence, WikiLeaks\u2019 document releases, along with many of Mr. Assange\u2019s statements, have often benefited Russia, at the expense of the West.Among United States officials, the emerging consensus is that Mr. Assange and WikiLeaks probably have no direct ties to Russian intelligence services. But they say that, at least in the case of the Democrats\u2019 emails, Moscow knew it had a sympathetic outlet in WikiLeaks, where intermediaries could drop pilfered documents in the group\u2019s anonymized digital inbox.In an interview on Wednesday with The Times, Mr. Assange said Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats were \u201cwhipping up a neo-McCarthyist hysteria about Russia.\u201d There is \u201cno concrete evidence\u201d that what WikiLeaks publishes comes from intelligence agencies, he said, even as he indicated that he would happily accept such material.WikiLeaks neither targets nor spares any particular nation, he added, but rather works to verify whatever material it is given in service of the public, which \u201cloves it when they get a glimpse into the corrupt machinery that is attempting to rule them.\u201dBut given WikiLeaks\u2019 limited resources and the hurdles of translation, Mr. Assange said, why focus on Russia, which he described as a \u201cbit player on the world stage,\u201d compared with countries like China and the United States? In any event, he said, Kremlin corruption is an old story. \u201cEvery man and his dog is criticizing Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit boring, isn\u2019t it?\u201dSince its inception, WikiLeaks has succeeded spectacularly on some fronts, uncovering indiscriminate killing, hypocrisy and corruption, and helping spark the Arab Spring.To Gavin MacFadyen, a WikiLeaks supporter who runs the Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of London, the question for Mr. Assange is not where the material comes from, but whether it is true and in the public interest. He noted that intelligence services had a long history of using news organizations to plant stories, and that Western news outlets often published \u201cmaterial that comes from the C.I.A. uncritically.\u201dRecent events, though, have left some transparency advocates wondering if WikiLeaks has lost its way. There is a big difference between publishing materials from a whistle-blower like Chelsea Manning \u2014 the soldier who gave WikiLeaks its war log and diplomatic cable scoops \u2014 and accepting information, even indirectly, from a foreign intelligence service seeking to advance its own powerful interests, said John Wonderlich, the executive director of the Sunlight Foundation, a group devoted to government transparency.\u201cThey\u2019re just aligning themselves with whoever gives them information to get attention or revenge against their enemies,\u201d Mr. Wonderlich said. \u201cThey\u2019re welcoming governments to hack into each other and disrupt each other\u2019s democratic processes, all on a pretty weak case for the public interest.\u201dOthers see Mr. Assange assuming an increasingly blinkered approach to the world that, coupled with his own secrecy, has left them disillusioned.\u201cThe battle for transparency was supposed to be global; at least Assange claimed that at the beginning,\u201d said Andrei A. Soldatov, an investigative journalist who has written extensively about Russia\u2019s security services.\u201cIt is strange that this principle is not being applied to Assange himself and his dealings with one particular country, and that is Russia,\u201d Mr. Soldatov said. \u201cHe seems to think that one may compromise a lot fighting a bigger evil.\u201dWikiLeaks was just getting started in 2006 when Mr. Assange, an Australian national, sent a mission statement to potential collaborators. One of his goals, he said, was to help expose \u201cillegal or immoral\u201d behavior by governments in the West.Mr. Assange made clear, though, that his main focus lay elsewhere. \u201cOur primary targets are those highly oppressive regimes in China, Russia and Central Eurasia,\u201d he wrote.Shortly after releasing the war logs in 2010, Mr. Assange threatened to make good on that promise. WikiLeaks, he told a Moscow newspaper, had obtained compromising materials \u201cabout Russia, about your government and your businessmen.\u201dBut Mr. Assange\u2019s life was soon upended. On Nov. 20 of that year, an international warrant was issued for his arrest in connection with allegations of sexual assault in Sweden, which he denies. Eight days later, WikiLeaks\u2019 release of a cache of State Department cables cast unvarnished \u2014 and unwelcome \u2014 light on the United States\u2019 diplomatic relationships.As Mr. Assange pointed out in the interview with The Times, many of the cables involved blunt judgments on Russia; one called it a \u201cmafia state.\u201d But the documents proved far more damaging to the United States\u2019 interests than to Russia\u2019s, and officials in Moscow seemed unperturbed. Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, dismissed Mr. Assange as a \u201cpetty thief running around on the internet.\u201dMr. Assange, asked soon after by Time magazine whether he still planned to expose the secret dealings of the Kremlin, reiterated his earlier vow. \u201cYes indeed,\u201d he said.But that promised assault would not materialize. Instead, with Mr. Assange\u2019s legal troubles mounting, Mr. Putin would come to his defense.In late November 2010, United States officials announced an investigation of WikiLeaks; Mrs. Clinton, whose State Department was scrambled by what became known as \u201cCablegate,\u201d vowed to take \u201caggressive\u201d steps to hold those responsible to account.The next month, Mr. Assange was arrested by the London police to face questioning by the Swedes, who he feared would turn him over to the Americans. Out on bail, he holed up and fought extradition at a Georgian country house owned by a supporter, Vaughan Smith, who said in an interview that he believed Mr. Assange to be the victim of an \u201cintense online bullying and disinformation\u201d campaign.One day after Mr. Assange\u2019s arrest, the Russian president appeared at a news conference with the French prime minister. Brushing off a questioner who suggested that the diplomatic cables portrayed Russia as undemocratic, Mr. Putin used the opportunity to bash the West.\u201cAs far as democracy goes, it should be a complete democracy. Why then did they put Mr. Assange behind bars?\u201d he asked. \u201cThere\u2019s an American saying: He who lives in a glass house shouldn\u2019t throw stones.\u201dHere are key points in his case since WikiLeaks burst onto the digital scene in 2010.It was the first of several times that Mr. Putin would take up Mr. Assange\u2019s cause. He has called the charges against Mr. Assange \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d and declared that the WikiLeaks founder is being \u201cpersecuted for spreading the information he received from the U.S. military regarding the actions of the U.S.A. in the Middle East, including Iraq.\u201dHow much he or WikiLeaks was paid for the 12 episodes remains unclear. In a written statement, Sunshine Press, which works as his spokesman, said Russia Today \u201cwas among a dozen broadcasters that purchased a broadcasting license for his show.\u201dBut on June 19, 2012, Mr. Assange\u2019s narrative quickly took a different turn. He broke bail after losing an appeal against extradition to Sweden and was granted asylum in the tiny embassy of Ecuador in London, overlooking the back of Harrods department store.One year later, a man who would soon eclipse Mr. Assange in terms of whistle-blowing fame boarded a plane in Hong Kong. His name was Edward J. Snowden, and he was a National Security Agency contractor-turned-fugitive, having stunned the world and strained American alliances by leaking documents that revealed a United States-led network of global surveillance programs.Mr. Snowden had not given his thousands of classified documents to WikiLeaks. Still, it was at the suggestion of Mr. Assange that the flight Mr. Snowden boarded on June 23, 2013, accompanied by his WikiLeaks colleague Sarah Harrison, was bound for Moscow, where Mr. Snowden remains today after the United States canceled his passport en route.In fact, worried that he would be seen as a spy, Mr. Snowden had hoped merely to pass through Russia on his way to South America, Mr. Assange later recounted, a plan he had not fully endorsed. Russia, he believed, could best protect Mr. Snowden from a C.I.A. kidnapping, or worse.\u201cNow I thought, and in fact advised Edward Snowden, that he would be safest in Moscow,\u201d Mr. Assange told the news program Democracy Now.Years earlier, during a November 2010 meeting with New York Times journalists negotiating for access to the diplomatic cables, Mr. Assange had mused about seeking refuge in Russia. Anticipating the likely fallout from the cables\u2019 release, Mr. Assange spoke of relocating to Russia and setting up WikiLeaks there. His associates were openly skeptical of the idea, given the Kremlin\u2019s ruthless surveillance apparatus and tight control over the news media.That Mr. Assange would now advise Mr. Snowden to travel that path is a measure not just of his worldview, but also of his circumstances and personality, friends and former colleagues say.Suelette Dreyfus, a longtime friend of Mr. Assange\u2019s and an academic who studies whistle-blowing, says his sole motivation is a deep-seated belief that governments and other large and powerful institutions must be held in check to safeguard the rights of individuals.\u201cThis is not an East-West fight,\u201d she said, though \u201cit is being presented as such by people with an agenda.But even as other longtime supporters continue to see Mr. Assange as a courageous crusader \u2014 \u201ca moral individual in a world of mass societies,\u201d as one put it \u2014 they say he can be vain and childlike, with a tendency to see the world as divided into those who support him and those who do not.During his time isolated in the Ecuadorean Embassy, under constant surveillance, his instinctive mistrust of the West hardened even as he became increasingly numb to the abuses of the Kremlin, which he viewed as a \u201cbulwark against Western imperialism,\u201d said one supporter, who like many others asked for anonymity for fear of angering Mr. Assange.Another person who collaborated with WikiLeaks in the past added: \u201cHe views everything through the prism of how he\u2019s treated. America and Hillary Clinton have caused him trouble, and Russia never has.\u201dThe result has been a \u201cone-dimensional confrontation with the U.S.A.,\u201d Daniel Domscheit-Berg, who before quitting WikiLeaks in 2010 was one of Mr. Assange\u2019s closest partners, has said.And the beneficiary of that confrontation, played out in a series of public statements by Mr. Assange and strategically timed document releases by WikiLeaks, has often been Mr. Putin. While the release of the Democratic Party documents appears to be the first time WikiLeaks has published material that United States officials assert was stolen by Russian intelligence, the agendas of WikiLeaks and Mr. Putin have repeatedly dovetailed since Mr. Assange fled to the embassy.Mr. Assange has at times offered mild criticisms of the Putin government. In a 2011 interview, for instance, he spoke of the \u201cPutinization\u201d of Russia. On Twitter, he has also called attention to Pussy Riot, the punk band whose members were jailed after taking on Mr. Putin.Mr. Assange has also taken a decidedly pro-Russian view of hostilities in Ukraine, where the Obama administration has accused Mr. Putin of supporting the separatists. The United States, Mr. Assange told an Argentine newspaper in March of last year, has been the one meddling there, fomenting unrest by \u201ctrying to draw Ukraine into the Western orbit, to pluck it out of Russia\u2019s sphere of influence.\u201d After the annexation of Crimea, he said Washington and its intelligence allies had \u201cannexed the whole world\u201d through global surveillance.Like Mr. Trump, who stood to gain from the Democratic Party leak, Mr. Assange supported Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, and he has repeatedly gone after NATO \u2014 taking on two organizations that Mr. Putin would like nothing more than to defang or dismantle.In September 2014, for instance, Mr. Assange wrote on Twitter about what he called the \u201ccorrupt deal\u201d that Turkey engineered to force the suppression of a pro-Kurdish television station in Denmark in return for allowing that country\u2019s prime minister, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, to take the helm of NATO.The timing of his Twitter post was curious on two fronts. It relied on a diplomatic cable that had garnered headlines when WikiLeaks released it four years earlier. And it followed a monthslong tit for tat between Mr. Rasmussen and Mr. Putin, with the Russian president taking the NATO chief to task for secretly recording their private conversation, and Mr. Rasmussen accusing Mr. Putin of playing a \u201cdouble game\u201d in Ukraine by issuing conciliatory statements while massing troops on the border and shipping weapons to the separatists.Mr. Assange again recycled the story this past June \u2014 days after President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine named Mr. Rasmussen a special adviser \u2014 this time via a video appearance at a Russian media forum attended by Mr. Putin and timed to coincide with the 75th anniversary of the Soviet Information Bureau.Then there are the leaks themselves. Some, such as hacked Church of Scientology documents, are of no obvious benefit to the Russians. But many are.The organization has published leaks of material from Saudi Arabia and Turkey, which are United States allies, but also to varying degrees from authoritarian regimes. The leaks came during times of heightened tension between those countries and Russia.The Saudi documents, for instance, which highlighted efforts to manipulate world opinion about the kingdom, were published months after Mr. Putin accused the Saudis of holding down oil prices to harm the economies of Russia and its allies Iran and Venezuela.Another set of leaks indirectly benefited Rosatom, Russia\u2019s state-owned atomic energy company. Those documents detailed a \u201ccorrupt multi-billion-dollar war by Western and Chinese companies\u201d \u2014 including Rosatom\u2019s chief competitors \u2014 to obtain uranium and other mining rights in the Central African Republic.WikiLeaks seems aware of a perception problem when it comes to Russia.When Russia Today began broadcasting Mr. Assange\u2019s television program, he joked in a statement that it would be used to \u201csmear\u201d him: \u201cAssange is a hopeless Kremlin stooge!\u201dAnd Sunshine Press, the group\u2019s public relations voice, pointed out that in 2012 WikiLeaks also published an archive it called the Syria files \u2014 more than two million emails from and about the government of President Bashar al-Assad, whom Russia is supporting in Syria\u2019s civil war.Yet at the time of the release, Mr. Assange\u2019s associate, Ms. Harrison, characterized the material as \u201cembarrassing to Syria, but it is also embarrassing to Syria\u2019s opponents.\u201d Since then, Mr. Assange has accused the United States of deliberately destabilizing Syria, but has not publicly criticized human rights abuses by Mr. Assad and Russian forces fighting there.Many of the documents WikiLeaks has published are classified, such as a C.I.A. tutorial on how to maintain cover in foreign airports. But what may be WikiLeaks\u2019 most intriguing release of secret documents involved what is, on the surface, a less sensational topic: trade negotiations.From November 2013 to May 2016, WikiLeaks published documents describing internal deliberations on two trade pacts: the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would liberalize trade between the United States, Japan and 10 other Pacific Rim countries, and the Trade in Services Agreement, an accord between the United States, 21 other countries and the European Union.Russia, which was excluded, has been the most vocal opponent of the pacts, with Mr. Putin portraying them as an effort to give the United States an unfair leg up in the global economy.The drafts released by WikiLeaks stirred controversy among environmentalists, advocates of internet freedom and privacy, labor leaders and corporate governance watchdogs, among others. They also stoked populist resentment against free trade that has become an important factor in American and European politics.The material was released at critical moments, with the apparent aim of thwarting negotiations, American trade officials said.WikiLeaks highlighted the domestic and international discord on its Twitter accounts.American negotiators assumed that the leaks had come from a party at the table seeking leverage. Then in July 2015, on the day American and Japanese negotiators were working out the final details of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, came what WikiLeaks dubbed its \u201cTarget Tokyo\u201d release.Relying on top-secret N.S.A. documents, the release highlighted 35 American espionage targets in Japan, including cabinet members and trade negotiators, as well as companies like Mitsubishi. The trade accord was finally agreed on \u2014 though it has not been ratified by the United States Senate \u2014 but the document release threw a wrench into the talks.\u201cThe lesson for Japan is this: Do not expect a global surveillance superpower to act with honor or respect,\u201d Mr. Assange said in a news release at the time. \u201cThere is only one rule: There are no rules.\u201dBecause of the files\u2019 provenance, United States intelligence officials assumed that Mr. Assange had gotten his hands on some of the N.S.A. documents copied by Mr. Snowden.But in an interview, Glenn Greenwald, one of the two journalists entrusted with the full Snowden archive, said that Mr. Snowden had not given his documents to WikiLeaks and that the \u201cTarget Tokyo\u201d documents were not even among those Mr. Snowden had taken.The same is true, Mr. Greenwald said, of another set of N.S.A. intercepts released by WikiLeaks that showed that the United States bugged conversations of United Nations officials and European allies, including private climate-control talks between Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon. On Wednesday, Mr. Assange said he had his own separate sources for N.S.A. material.That raises the question of whether another, still-secret, N.S.A. whistle-blower is leaking documents to WikiLeaks, or whether the files were obtained from the outside via a sophisticated cyberespionage operation, possibly sponsored by a state actor. That question was underscored by Mr. Assange\u2019s statement a few weeks ago that he would release the codes that the United States uses to hack others.And that has some former collaborators questioning just who is giving Mr. Assange his information these days.\u201cIt\u2019s not in his temperament to be a cat\u2019s paw, and I don\u2019t think he would take anything overtly from the F.S.B.,\u201d said one, referring to the Russian intelligence agency. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t trust them enough. But if someone could plausibly be seen as a hacker group, he\u2019d be fine. He was never too thorough about checking out sources or motivations.\u201dIn April of this year, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists unleashed a torrent of articles that reverberated around the world.Based on 11.5 million leaked documents from a Panamanian law firm that specialized in creating secretive offshore companies, the \u201cPanama Papers\u201d offered a look inside a shadowy world in which banks, law firms and asset management companies help the world\u2019s rich and powerful hide wealth and avoid taxes.It was the largest archive of leaked documents that journalists had ever handled, and so it was no surprise that WikiLeaks initially linked to the consortium\u2019s work on Twitter. But what shocked some of the journalists involved was what WikiLeaks did next.Among the biggest stories was one showing how billions of dollars had wound up in shell companies controlled by one of Mr. Putin\u2019s closest friends, a cellist named Sergei P. Roldugin. Nearly a dozen news organizations, including two of Russia\u2019s last independent newspapers, Vedomosti and Novaya Gazeta, had collaborated in tracing the money.But WikiLeaks seized on the contribution of just one: the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project. In a series of Twitter posts after the revelations about Mr. Roldugin, WikiLeaks questioned the integrity of the reporting, noting that the project had received grants from the Soros Foundation and the United States Agency for International Development.In fact, the consortium\u2019s opening salvo featured many hard-hitting articles with Western targets, including one on the use of offshore companies in tax havens by the father of then-Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain. Another focused on an offshore company set up by the Ukrainian president, Mr. Poroshenko, a Putin enemy.Nevertheless, Mr. Putin seized on WikiLeaks\u2019 take on the controversy to defend himself. He declared that while the articles suggested that \u201cthere is this friend of the Russian president, and they say he has done something, probably corruption-related, in fact there is no corruption involved at all.\u201d\u201cBesides,\u201d he added, \u201cwe now know from WikiLeaks that officials and state agencies in the United States are behind all this.\u201dBut Mr. Soldatov, the Russian investigative journalist, was so furious that he confronted Ms. Harrison, Mr. Assange\u2019s associate, at a journalism conference in Italy the next day. \u201cMany journalists at Novaya Gazeta were killed\u201d after reporting on Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia, he told her, \u201cand now their integrity is questioned by WikiLeaks?\u201dIt is striking, Mr. Soldatov said in an interview, that Mr. Snowden, who is stuck in Moscow, is far more willing to criticize Mr. Putin than is Mr. Assange, whom he sees as an apologist.Roman Shleynov, who worked on the project first at Vedmosti and then as an editor at the Organized Crime and Reporting Project, said that he, too, was \u201cat a loss\u201d to explain Mr. Assange\u2019s attack on the Panama Papers.\u201cFor me it was a surprise that Mr. Assange was repeating the same excuse that our officials, even back in Soviet days, used to say \u2014 that it\u2019s all some conspiracy from abroad,\u201d Mr. Shleynov said.\u201cI understand his struggle with the United States,\u201d he added, \u201cbut I never thought he\u2019d use our work, the work of Russian journalists, to make such a statement. I respected and still respect what Julian Assange has done, but I have changed my opinion of him as a person.\u201dFour years into his time at the Ecuadorean Embassy, he is increasingly isolated. Now 45, he lives in two small rooms: an office equipped with a bed, sunlamp, phone, computer, kitchenette, shower, treadmill and bookshelves, and a conference room where he can meet with visitors and oversee the operation with the help of a few dozen employees, mostly in Berlin. One person familiar with the setup called it \u201ca gas station with two attendants.\u201dMelinda Taylor, one of Mr. Assange\u2019s lawyers, said that he needed dental work and a magnetic resonance imaging scan for a painful shoulder, but that those procedures could not be done inside the embassy for practical and insurance reasons.

But Mr. Assange\u2019s decision to abandon that approach in the name of total transparency is what led Mr. Snowden to work with Mr. Greenwald and another journalist on the N.S.A. revelations. Mr. Snowden felt openness should be balanced with concern for people\u2019s privacy and safety.Mr. Greenwald said of Mr. Assange, \u201cHe\u2019s alienated a lot of people.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s often hard for me to separate my personal views of Julian with my views of WikiLeaks\u201d he added. \u201cI do think on balance WikiLeaks is a force for good.\u201d\u201cThe U.S. and the West will hold out a U.N. working group decision when it is in their favor,\u201d said Jennifer Robinson, one of his lawyers. \u201cBut when it\u2019s about Julian Assange, they criticize and undermine.\u201dMr. Assange tries to keep his mind off his troubles with his guitar and a cat given to him by his children, but what really lifts his spirits is publishing new leaks like the Democrats\u2019 files. \u201cThe work keeps him going,\u201d said his colleague, Ms. Harrison.Is there an October surprise in his back pocket?\u201cJulian loves misinformation; it\u2019s his passion,\u201d Mr. Greenwald said. \u201cHe\u2019d likely say this just to make the Clintons uncomfortable.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Assange is looking a bit further on.\u201cLet\u2019s leap forward a couple of years,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cLet\u2019s imagine that rival intelligence services \u2014 in the U.S., in China \u2014 went to settle their conflicts about who is right, who\u2019s the good actor, who\u2019s the bad actor, on a particular situation by presenting the public the truth.\u201cThat\u2019s the most amazing advance I can think of.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But the junta also censored the press, shut down television and radio stations, blocked access to international media and detained scores of people for challenging its rule. In one egregious case, it charged eight people for mocking the prime minister and the head of the junta, Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha, on Facebook.Thais are now gearing up for an election next year.

{"Headline": "Many Soldiers, Few Signs, Long Lines: The Rio Games Beyond the TV Screen", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEssayRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 At the women\u2019s 3-meter synchronized diving final on Sunday, there seemed to be two events occurring at once. There was the one displayed on a large video screen at the outdoor arena, and there was the live one in front of your eyes. The events were identical except for one notable detail: On the screen, the sun appeared to be shining, and in real life, it was not.The Olympics look different in the flesh. Television has a way of not just framing and editing the action but also adding sheen and brightness. The lush and immaculate tableaus served up by NBC and other broadcasters are like faces that have been tastefully daubed in makeup. They look great, but they leave out all the uniqueness, all the texture.What does it actually feel like to be here? The answer is that it is odd, sometimes maddening, possibly dangerous and frequently a hoot.Safety first. There was a lot of angst about crime as these Games approached, and there have been reports of muggings since the athletes arrived. What is now clear is this: Rio is the safest-feeling dangerous place you will ever visit. Nothing about walking the streets here feels even remotely menacing \u2014 until you walk the streets with someone from Rio.At that point, you learn that you are surrounded by a terrifying variety of perils, including knife-wielding muggers. The beaches of Copacabana seem like a paradise of minimalist swimwear. Then you are told about the very young bandits who occasionally swarm the sand and steal everything that is not hidden or bolted to the ground.15 PhotosOh, and those friendly yellow-cab drivers who have been transporting you here and there? Some of them will take your 50 reals (about $17) and assert that it was 5 reals \u2014 so cough up the rest of the fare. Even some of the machines are larcenous. Locals swear that they have encountered ATMs that purport to spit out money while spitting out nothing.The less time you speak to Cariocas, as natives of Rio are known, the more you will enjoy this place. Lagoa Stadium, where rowing events are being held, is near Leblon, one of the more upscale parts of the city. All around you, exotic mountains jut to the heavens. It looks like a movie set. Until a local points to an immense and somewhat shabby white building, a few blocks away, and explains that it is a housing project where rival drug gangs occasionally lob homemade grenades at one another.Wait, that building right there?\u201cRight there,\u201d a Carioca says. \u201cThey sometimes shoot at each other on the street, when kids are returning from school.\u201dThe general sense of dread and hazard seems to have reached fans before they flew here. A gentlemen in his 50s, who was exiting Lagoa with his wife and some friends, said he had left his wedding band at home \u2014 \u201cFirst time in 27 years, I\u2019m not wearing it,\u201d he said, holding up his left hand \u2014 just in case. And all the people in his little group had decided to keep their big stash of money in their socks and a small stash in their pockets.There are some 85,000 soldiers stationed across the city, including plenty of them at the Olympic venues. Some carry machine guns and have their fingers on their triggers, the ready-for-trouble mode you associate with guards overseeing a cash drop near a Brinks truck. Some of the soldiers travel in dark green troop transport trucks associated with war-zone invasions.The projection of all this force is only intermittently comforting. The abundance of weapons took on a frightening cast on Saturday when a large-caliber bullet landed in the media tent at the Equestrian Center right after journalists heard a loud bang. Apparently it was shot from a favela, at a police blimp being used for security.At a news conference, a spokesman for the Games described the episode as an \u201cunfortunate event\u201d and underscored that \u201call lives are important \u2014 horses, dogs, people.\u201dAlthough they look on television like a series of athletic contests, the Games up close are the single most daunting logistical challenge in the known universe. The more you see of them, the crazier it seems that anyone would voluntarily undertake them. To pull it off is to create a modest-size city, layered on top of an existing city, a realm with a three-week life span in desperate need of food, water and electricity as well as systems for transportation, waste removal, ticketing and the management of countless employees and volunteers, and the list goes on.It is an event planner\u2019s knottiest puzzle, and the way countries solve it has a way of reflecting their national character. In Sochi, Russia, the Games had a strange combination of incompetence (shabbily constructed housing that was not finished, for instance) and clockwork (transportation that ran on time), which is exactly what you would expect from an autocratic regime plagued by corruption.Whatever motivates Olympic employees here, it is not fear. The atmosphere is kind of laid-back. A British reporter trying to get to his hotel from Deodoro, the event center in the West Zone, was heard asking an Olympic volunteer with a clipboard, \u201cWhen will the van arrive?\u201d\u201cTen minutes,\u201d she said.\u201cYou\u2019ve been saying that for an hour,\u201d he countered, rolling his eyes.At times, these Games are like an elaborate recipe that is missing some essential ingredients. Let\u2019s talk about the signs. It is not just the oopsy-daisy translations. (A list of prohibited items at a security check includes a ban on \u201cwhite weapons.\u201d) What is odd is the curious absence of basic \u201cHere\u2019s Where to Go\u201d markers, which has added degrees of difficulty to navigating that seem totally unnecessary.The buses, for instance. They are an essential source of transportation, but for the first few days, there were stops that were nearly unmarked but for a green pole.Then there is the lack of signs that simply celebrate the presence of the Games. Typically, a host city is a riot of bunting and street banners, making it impossible to walk a block without a reminder that the Olympics are in town. In Rio, just 15 percent of promotional signs had been delivered by the time of the opening ceremony, according to organizers, who had called an emergency meeting with the supplier.In addition, you come across lots of places that are absurdly understaffed. In fact, until some indelible sports memories are conjured, a suitable bronze commemorating the Rio Olympics would be a handful of people stewing in line. There have been 90-minute lines to enter venues and lines for food that were so long that the organizers announced a tenfold increase in manpower and then shed a few menu items that were said to be holding things up.On Sunday night, the line to enter the Mega Store in the Olympic Park, where you can buy Olympic-branded merchandise, was so many hundreds of yards long that it was hard to see where it began.All Olympics have their own character, but pinpointing Rio\u2019s will be difficult because the events are held in such drastically different places. Beach volleyball is played in Copacabana, a dense neighborhood that has been a party and beach scene for decades. Track and field, a marquee attraction at the Summer Games, will be held at the Olympic Stadium in the Engenho de Dentro neighborhood, about 12 miles northwest.Nowhere close to any of that is the Olympic Park itself, what is supposed to be the heart of the Games. It is in an area in the West Zone known as Barra da Tijuca, a newish suburb for the rich, a region dotted with dozens and dozens of indistinguishable residential apartment buildings, interspersed with malls. (New York is the theme of one of the larger malls, which features a huge reproduction of the Statue of Liberty.) Plus there are car dealerships for every model you can imagine, and a few you have forgotten. Which is apt because this place is not designed for walking.The park itself is a wide and largely barren expanse of asphalt. In previous Games, organizers enhanced their Olympic parks with entertainment or sculptures or benches. Not here. This is a place to get from Point A to Point B without worrying you will run into Point C. There are places to buy food, some tables, a McDonald\u2019s that sells ice cream, and that Mega Store. In the middle, there is the studio for Globo, Brazil\u2019s multimedia giant. And that is about it.By contrast, when you walk out of the Beach Volleyball Arena in Copacabana, you will encounter urban living as its richest and most joyful. Men selling caipirinhas, the national cocktail. A woman dressed as a mime, blowing enormous bubbles with a bucket and some twine. A guy taking bets from people who think they can kick over two carefully placed bottles with a soccer ball. (Like Weebles, these bottles wobbled but never fell down.) Proselytizers handing out Bibles.The Copacabana Hotel, which is almost directly across from the volleyball venue, offered a high-tech show in which butterflies seemed to flicker up and down its exterior, their wings painted the flags of different nations, while a modern rendering of Vivaldi boomed on huge speakers across the street. This briefly brought the entire parade of humanity to a standstill. People gaped in awe and then applauded when the show was over.Rio is not the first Olympic host to spread venues around a city. But it is the first to set one of those venues in a place with soul to spare and another without any soul at all. Unless it fixes the transportation problem, these might also be the first Olympics where you simply cannot get where you need to go in anything approaching a reasonable amount of time. Right now, the Games\u2019 transportation app is telling users that if they want to get from Copacabana to the Equestrian Center, roughly 25 miles away, they are looking at a two-hour journey.But an Olympics is like a living organism, which is to say, it learns. The same trip might take half that long in a few days.As for the venues, none of them feel lavish. There is not a starchitect standout, like Beijing\u2019s Bird\u2019s Nest, in the bunch. This is the just-enough Olympics. You see plenty of scaffolding around, including at the entrance to the Olympic Park. It is as though the organizers did not want to offend the sensibilities of Brazilians already chafing at the price of this show. (Approximately many billions of dollars.)The few signs heralding the Games that you do see are emblazoned with the motto \u201cA New World.\u201d It is an unfortunate phrase, given that the new world referred to is the bustling, economically expanding Brazil that in 2009 won the right to host the Games, a place where the gross domestic product had doubled in a decade. The latest iteration of the country\u2019s new world is in both a funk and a recession.This gives Cariocas plenty to fume about since much of the nation\u2019s economic decline can be pinned on the shenanigans of public officials. But the locals you meet here come across as eager to chat and happy you are here.Perhaps if they had known where their economy was headed a few years back, they would have canceled this shindig. But if the world is visiting, they would like everyone to leave with a positive impression.\u201cWe are very proud of our country,\u201d said a woman dining at a food-by-the-kilogram restaurant on Sunday. \u201cWe want people to see that.\u201dShe said that most of her friends were given three weeks of vacation, so they could stay home and keep the streets as traffic-free as possible. That is not exactly a sacrifice, but Olympics-only lanes have been established around the city, to help move athletes and the news media around Rio\u2019s already choked roads, which has turned the non-Olympic lanes into quagmires. In addition, police resources have been funneled to the Games, which has inevitably led to an uptick in crime in areas that are not near the events.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japanese Government Urges Another Increase in Military Spending", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 The government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is requesting another increase in spending on Japan\u2019s armed forces, with a plan to expand missile defenses that would test the nation\u2019s commitment to pacifism and escalate a regional arms race with China and North Korea.With rising threats from North Korea\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile program and repeated incursions by Chinese ships into waters surrounding a string of islands claimed by Japan, the request would let the Defense Ministry develop new antiballistic missiles and place troops on southern islands closer to the chain in dispute with China.If approved, the budget proposal for 5.17 trillion yen, or $50.2 billion, formally submitted on Wednesday, would be the nation\u2019s fifth-straight annual increase in military spending. It is a 2.3 percent rise over last year.The request includes proposals to develop and potentially purchase new antiballistic missiles that can be launched from ships or land, and to upgrade and extend the range of the country\u2019s current land-based missile defense systems, a significant expansion of Japan\u2019s missile defense capabilities.The budget also details plans to buy an additional submarine and new fighter aircraft, and to put close to 1,300 soldiers from the Self-Defense Force, Japan\u2019s military, on the southern islands of Kagoshima and Okinawa. These locations are closer to the Senkaku, the chain of islands where both China and Japan claim territorial rights.Despite Japan\u2019s longstanding postwar pacifism, initially imposed by a Constitution that was largely written by American occupiers, the country has long argued that the Constitution does not prevent it from maintaining defensive equipment and troops.But the definition of what is needed to defend the country has evolved as Japan confronts new dangers. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, government assessments of security in the region led to a decrease in defense budgets every year.Yet five years ago, the government began increasing its budget again as new provocations emerged from China and North Korea.Japan\u2019s current land-based missile defense systems have a medium range for intercepting incoming ballistic missiles. By expanding that range, the new systems should be able to shoot down missiles before they get so close.Japan\u2019s defense budget proposal includes funds to help proceed with development, in conjunction with the United States, of advanced antiballistic missiles that can be launched from ships and that have much longer ranges than previous incarnations.Experts said these missiles could be used not only to shoot down North Korean missiles, but also to deter China from invading the disputed islands. Placing more troops on the southern islands of Japan is also intended to deter China from moving closer to the Senkaku.\u201cWhen one nation does something which it believes to be defensive and in its own interests, its competitor will see it as threatening and see it as offensive, and then you get this arms race and security dilemma,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s very much in play here.\u201dThe Defense Ministry\u2019s budget request must be reviewed by the Finance Ministry and approved by Parliament before any purchases can be made.Analysts said nothing in the new budget request suggested that Japan would cross the line from a primarily defensive stance to a more offensive one.\u201cIf they started to procure long-range bombers or intercontinental ballistic missiles, those would be the things where I would say, \u2018Now we are seeing something radically different,\u2019\u201d said Jeffrey Hornung, a research fellow for security and foreign policy at Sasakawa USA, a think tank in Washington.The new equipment proposals also seem carefully calibrated to address current threats. The plan to extend the range of existing PAC-3 missile defense systems from the current limit of about 19 miles, for example, would help Japan protect against North Korean missiles but avoid the appearance of instigating new confrontations, analysts said.\u201cI think these ranges are very carefully selected,\u201d said Bonnie S. Glaser, senior Asia adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. She noted that Japan would, for instance, be aware of China\u2019s objection to any hint that Japan might get involved in disputes over Taiwan. The distances of the missiles proposed, she said, would not extend to Taiwan.All told, the budget request remains less than 1 percent of Japan\u2019s gross domestic product, a self-imposed constraint that few Japanese administrations have breached.Some analysts noted that with China rapidly increasing its military budget, Japan\u2019s current military spending might not be sufficient. \u201cIn the long run, if the military balance in East Asia shifts in favor of China significantly, we might have to do much more than what we are doing right now,\u201d said Narushige Michishita, director of the Security and International Studies Program at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo.Tooru Miyamoto, a Communist Party member of the House of Representatives, said he did not approve of the increased expenditures at a time when the economy continues to stagnate. \u201cI want such money to be spent on day care centers,\u201d he said.At an annual review staged by the Ground Self-Defense Force in the foothills of Mount Fuji last weekend, 25,000 spectators gathered to watch a parade of tanks, helicopters and other armored vehicles, with soldiers detonating artillery against artificial targets.In one segment described as a demonstration of how troops would respond to an attack on unspecified islands, soldiers dropped from Chinook helicopters and tanks rolled across a muddy field.Naoko Matsumaru, 42, who works in a flour mill, attended the drills with her young daughter and son.She said that she had been concerned about threats from North Korea and China, but that \u201cafter seeing today\u2019s show, I feel maybe we are actually O.K.\u201dThose who value Japan\u2019s pacifism said they were concerned about the expanded military role.\u201cIn these times, I am a little bit worried,\u201d said Toru Matsuzaki, 71, a woodworker. He referred to a generation of \u201cheiwa boke,\u201d people who innocently take peace for granted. \u201cRealistically, it may be necessary to increase the budget,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t like it.\u201dMakiko Inoue contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China, Eager to Host Elite Club, Primps for G-20 Meeting", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHANGZHOU, China \u2014 As China prepares to host the Group of 20 economic summit meeting this weekend in Hangzhou, it is determined to show the world that it is an equal partner in one of the most exclusive clubs of wealthy nations.The conference, in this striking lakeside city south of Shanghai, will be the most significant gathering of world leaders in China\u2019s history, and President Xi Jinping has ordered stringent security to ensure it goes off without a hitch.The government is using all the levers of its authoritarian system, forcing residents to move out of buildings near the meeting site to diminish the risk of protests or attacks and telling workers to take vacations to help clear the city and present a sanitized version of one of China\u2019s most vibrant economic hubs.It has gone so far as to banish cooks who are Uighurs, a Muslim minority that has been accused of fomenting terrorism, from working at one restaurant in the city.The rotating presidency, now held by China, is the culmination of a long battle for acceptance at the top of the international system. Though China is a member of the United Nations Security Council, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade Organization, the country\u2019s leadership feels as if it has been treated too much like a Johnny-come-lately at global summit meetings.The Group of 20 appeals to China as a place to stake its influence because its members include some developing countries that Beijing enlists as friends, yet as a whole the group represents more than 80 percent of the world economy and a big portion of world trade.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.\u201cThere will not be any policy miracles coming out of the summit,\u201d said Tristram Sainsbury, project director of G-20 studies at the Lowy Institute for International Policy in Australia.The party\u2019s resilience under Mr. Xi \u2014 on display with giant flags showing the hammer and sickle at security checkpoints \u2014 is part of the meeting\u2019s message.One of Mr. Xi\u2019s provincial successors, the party chief, Xia Baolong, said the meeting would \u201cdemonstrate the great achievement of China\u2019s opening and reform, and the immense superiority of socialism with Chinese characteristics,\u201d the government\u2019s description of its political and economic system.In Hangzhou, thousands have been forced to move from luxury high-rise buildings near the conference center, their apartments sealed with tape to prevent a sniper from venturing inside. Government and private sector workers have been granted vacations, and migrant workers have been told to return to their home provinces. In an effort to guarantee blue skies, factories within a wide perimeter around the city have been closed.Yet some of the security measures here seem picayune. Two weeks before the meeting, the kitchen division of the Metro Center department store was devoid of knives. They had been banned for sale since June, a saleswoman said. At a Starbucks in the center of the city, the food counter was empty. Delivery trucks had been unable to crack the security cordon, the barista said.A major focus of security has been the Uighurs. At the Beijiang restaurant, with wall murals of China\u2019s western deserts and a halal menu, 10 Uighur cooks were sent home in June at the request of the government, said the manager, Cai Ziwei.Only afterward was the establishment placed on a list of restaurants recommended for Muslim delegates to the meeting, he said.Hotels were told two months ago that they must inform the police if a Uighur tried to register, a worker at the Hanting hotel chain said.In June, police officers in the migrant neighborhood of Qibao, 15 miles from the city center, ordered all the grocery shops, clothing outlets and street-side restaurants closed, said Wang Jinfu, a municipal government worker.In some instances, small businesses were asked to close on the grounds that if they stayed open and an accident occurred, local party officials would be penalized.\u201cThey told us, this is a once-in-a-lifetime thing, and if anything happens while Obama is here, the officials could be sacked, so they said, \u2018Please close,\u2019 \u201d said Li Yindeng, the owner of Chenyang, a noodle shop. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do, and the government doesn\u2019t pay compensation.\u201dOne party official was detained for 10 days in July for complaining online about the high costs of the preparations. The state-run Global Times reported that the official, Guo Enping, was held because his article, \u201cHangzhou, Shame on You,\u201d drew such wide readership.As the rules began to disrupt daily life, more people vented online, and calls to the city\u2019s hotline mounted. \u201cEvery day our media attacks the vicious foreign powers, and now they come, we have to kneel and serve,\u201d one person wrote.For a public that regularly faces problems of contaminated food, there was dismay when the leader of the state authority for grain, Ren Zhengxiao, said he would not allow \u201cone single grain of unsafe rice or one drop of unsafe oil\u201d to enter the kitchens preparing the leaders\u2019 banquet meal.The government urged everyone to get with program.\u201cPeople must not express their discontent with unreasonable actions or even deny the importance of the security work of the G-20 summit,\u201d the state-run Zhejiang Daily wrote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can We Save Venice Before It\u2019s Too Late?", "Date": "2016-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed Contributor6 PhotosPISA, Italy \u2014 A deadly plague haunts Venice, and it\u2019s not the cholera to which Thomas Mann\u2019s character Gustav von Aschenbach succumbed in the Nobel laureate\u2019s 1912 novella \u201cDeath in Venice.\u201d A rapacious tourist monoculture threatens Venice\u2019s existence, decimating the historic city and turning the Queen of the Adriatic into a Disneyfied shopping mall.Millions of tourists pour into Venice\u2019s streets and canals each year, profoundly altering the population and the economy, as many native citizens are banished from the island city and those who remain have no choice but to serve in hotels, restaurants and shops selling glass souvenirs and carnival masks.Tourism is tearing apart Venice\u2019s social fabric, cohesion and civic culture, growing ever more predatory. The number of visitors to the city may rise even further now that international travelers are avoiding destinations like Turkey and Tunisia because of fears of terrorism and unrest. This means that the 2,400 hotels and other overnight accommodations the city now has no longer satisfy the travel industry\u2019s appetites. The total number of guest quarters in Venice\u2019s historic center could reach 50,000 and take it over entirely.Just along the Grand Canal, Venice\u2019s main waterway, the last 15 years have seen the closure of state institutions, judicial offices, banks, the German Consulate, medical practices and stores to make way for 16 new hotels.Alarm at this state of affairs led to last month\u2019s decision by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization to place Venice on its World Heritage in Danger list unless substantial progress to halt the degradation of the city and its ecosystem is made by next February. Unesco has so far stripped only one city of its status as a heritage site from the more than 1,000 on the list: Dresden, after German authorities ignored Unesco\u2019s 2009 recommendations against building a bridge over the River Elbe that marred the Baroque urban ensemble. Will Venice be next to attain this ignominious status?In its July report, Unesco\u2019s committee on heritage sites expressed \u201cextreme concern\u201d about \u201cthe combination of ongoing transformations and proposed projects threatening irreversible changes to the overall relationship between the City and its Lagoon,\u201d which would, in its thinking, erode the integrity of Venice.Unesco\u2019s ultimatum stems from several longstanding problems. First, the increasing imbalance between the number of the city\u2019s inhabitants (which plummeted from 174,808 in 1951 to 56,311 in 2014, the most recent year for which numbers are available) and the tourists. Proposed large-scale development, including new deepwater navigation channels and a subway running under the lagoon, would hasten erosion and strain the fragile ecological-urban system that has grown up around Venice.For now, gigantic cruise liners regularly parade in front of Piazza San Marco, the city\u2019s main public square, mocking the achievements of the last 1,500 years. To mention but one, the M.S.C. Divina is 222 feet high, twice as tall as the Doge\u2019s Palace, a landmark of the city that was built in the 14th century. At times, a dozen liners have entered the lagoon in a single day.The inept response of the Italian authorities to the very real problems facing Venice gives little hope that this situation will change anytime soon. After the shipwreck of the Costa Concordia in January 2012 off the coast of Tuscany left 32 people dead, the Italian government ruled that megaships must stay at least two miles from shore to prevent similar occurrences in the future. But the Italian government, predictably, failed to stand up to the big money promised by the tourist companies: A loophole to that law was created just for Venice. A cruise liner running ashore in the Piazza San Marco would wreck centuries of irreplaceable history.Furthermore, after a corruption scandal over a multibillion-dollar lagoon barrier project forced Mayor Giorgio Orsoni to resign in June 2014, he was replaced a year later by Luigi Brugnaro, a booster of Venice\u2019s tourism. Mr. Brugnaro not only fully welcomes the gargantuan ships but has even proposed the sale of millions of dollars of art from the city\u2019s museums to help manage Venice\u2019s ballooning debt.The destruction of Venice is not in Italy\u2019s best interest, yet the authorities remain paralyzed.

{"Headline": "The Case for More Government and Higher Taxes", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneIt may be hard to remember, but Americans once appreciated the government that serves them. That\u2019s long gone.Yet it\u2019s not as if nothing can be done. These frustrated Americans may not fully realize it, under the influence of decades worth of sermons about government\u2019s ultimate incompetence and venality. But there\u2019s a strong case for more government \u2014 not less \u2014 as the most promising way to improve the nation\u2019s standard of living.\u201cA national instinct that small government is always better than large government is grounded not in facts but rather in ideology and politics,\u201d they write. The evidence throughout the history of modern capitalism \u201cshows that more government can lead to greater security, enhanced opportunity and a fairer sharing of national wealth.\u201dThe scholars laid out four important tasks: improving the economy\u2019s productivity, bolstering workers\u2019 economic security, investing in education to close the opportunity deficit of low-income families, and ensuring that Middle America reaps a larger share of the spoils of growth.Their strategy includes more investment in the nation\u2019s buckling infrastructure and expanding unemployment and health insurance. It calls for paid sick leave, parental leave and wage insurance for workers who suffer a pay cut when changing jobs. And they argue for more resources for poor families with children and for universal early childhood education.This agenda won\u2019t come cheap. They propose raising government spending by 10 percentage points of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product ($1.8 trillion in today\u2019s dollars), to bring it to some 48 percent of G.D.P. by 2065.That might sound like a lot of money. But it is roughly where Germany, Norway and Britain are today. And it is well below government spending in countries like France, Sweden and Denmark.Despite arguments that Big Government hinders economic activity, many countries where government has grown the most have also experienced stronger economic growth. Governments have grown across most industrialized nations \u2014 raising more taxes over time to offer more public services. In the United States, by contrast, the government remains virtually as small as it was 50 years ago.Here are some other things Europeans got from their trade-off: lower poverty rates, lower income inequality, longer life spans, lower infant mortality rates, lower teenage pregnancy rates and lower rates of preventable death. And the coolest part, according to Mr. Lindert \u2014 one of the authors of the case for big government \u2014 is that they achieved this \u201cwithout any clear loss in G.D.P.\u201dEven assuming that higher taxes might distort incentives, the authors concluded, negative effects are offset by positive effects that flow from productive government investments in things like health, education, infrastructure and support for mothers to join the labor force.The American government pretty much stopped growing when the civil rights movement forced whites to share public space with blacks. Tax revenue as a share of the nation\u2019s economic output hit a peak in 1969 that it would not attain again until 1996, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.But for all the racial subtext to the election this year, times seem to be changing in unexpected ways.This does not mean, of course, that Big Government will get its day. For starters, small government Republican orthodoxy is likely to prevail in the House for years to come.\u201cLong-term common problems and trends in rich nations are the fundamental driving forces in the development of welfare state institutions,\u201d they concluded. The United States\u2019 swing to the right since the 1970s might have moved it in the opposite direction for a while, but \u201call rich nations have large welfare states.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of the college where Timothy Smeeding works.

{"Headline": "Ethnic Kurds Find Haven, but No Home, in Insular Japan", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKAWAGUCHI, Japan \u2014 Mahircan Yucel moved to Japan a dozen years ago as a teenager fleeing sectarian violence in Turkey. He learned Japanese, got married, had two children and grew to love his adopted homeland. But Japan has refused to accept him and could force him to leave.\u201cThe truth is, I have lived in Japan for such a long time,\u201d he said on a recent evening in a small living room that doubles as his infant son\u2019s bedroom. \u201cAll I want to do is work and carry out a decent life.\u201dMr. Yucel, 27, is one of about 1,300 ethnic Kurds who have settled in Kawaguchi, an industrial city north of Tokyo, and in the neighboring city of Warabi. They live in a perpetual limbo, seeking protection as refugees in a country that is among the most reluctant in the world to give it.At the same time, growing numbers have sought asylum in Japan, and almost all of them have been rejected or told to wait. More than 7,500 people applied for refugee status in 2015, up 52 percent from a year earlier. The government granted asylum to just 27 of them.In 2010, Japan began to accept refugees who had fled Myanmar to camps in Thailand. But it has taken in only 24 families since then, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This summer, the government also agreed to host up to 150 Syrian refugees as foreign exchange students.At the United Nations General Assembly in September, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the country needed to focus on its economy before considering whether to accept more refugees or immigrants.Nearly 14,000 people in Japan are in some stage of an asylum process that usually lasts more than three years and that some critics say is designed to deter new migrants from applying. Asylum seekers may work while they wait for an answer, but those denied refugee status can be given temporary permits that prohibit them from working while giving them no living stipends.Yasuhiro Hishida, assistant to the director of Japan\u2019s Refugee Status Recognition Office, said officials suspected widespread abuse of the refugee process. Most applicants come from countries that are not currently considered conflict zones, including Nepal, Vietnam and Sri Lanka, he said, suggesting that they are economic migrants rather than refugees fleeing persecution.Immigrant advocates say the government exaggerates the number of unfounded refugee claims. \u201cIn reality, there are so many people who are waiting and are facing a life of danger,\u201d said Shiho Tanaka, spokeswoman for the Japanese Association for Refugees.With the native Japanese population declining, she added, \u201cthere are companies that want to hire them and need laborers.\u201d\u201cIf you see my country, there is a lot of bullying and people being killed,\u201d he said, growing visibly agitated. \u201cI can\u2019t even speak anymore.\u201dMr. Yucel married a Japanese-Brazilian woman with permanent residency, but that does not allow him to work in Japan legally. The authorities detained one of his elder brothers this spring after he overstayed a temporary permit, and Mr. Yucel fears he could be next.Kurds began arriving from Turkey and seeking asylum in Japan in the early 1990s, as the Turkish government battled an insurgency by Kurdish militants. Japan was an easy destination because Turkish citizens do not need visas to travel here. As family and friends followed, they settled around Kawaguchi and Warabi. Local residents named the community Warabistan.Over time, some married Japanese citizens, which conferred long-term visa rights, and some opened their own businesses. There are a few Kurdish-owned restaurants in Kawaguchi, and many of the immigrants work at Kurdish-owned demolition and construction firms.But most Kurds here, like Mr. Yucel, are stuck on temporary permits that need to be renewed every six months. Those without permission to work cobble together off-the-books jobs, which puts them at risk of being detained for months or deported.\u201cI want the Japanese government to understand that real refugees are in trouble,\u201d said Eyyup Kurt, 29, a Kurdish journalist who applied for asylum 18 months ago. He said he had been arrested five times in Turkey and had been shot at by a member of the Islamic State while investigating a training site.The Japanese public has mixed feelings about refugees. Some say the country has a moral responsibility to welcome those fleeing danger in their home countries, while others fear the newcomers could bring increased crime or take jobs from Japanese workers.Kurds have worked hard to integrate. Many take Japanese language lessons at the cultural association, which also runs neighborhood patrols to make sure Kurds are not bothering their Japanese neighbors. This year, after an earthquake struck Kumamoto on the southern island of Kyushu, a group traveled south to help clear the rubble.Some Japanese remain wary. City officials in Kawaguchi said they received complaints about late-night gatherings and garbage in Kurdish neighborhoods. Young Kurdish men tend to congregate outside a convenience store near the train station in Warabi, and merchants say they frighten some customers.\u201cSometimes I see that they get into fights, and the police have to come,\u201d said Hiroe Hokiyama, 21, a college junior. \u201cIt is a little bit scary.\u201dOthers are more welcoming. Shori Nishizawa, 57, the owner of an appliance store a few blocks from Happy Kebab, a Kurdish-owned restaurant here, said he often watched young Kurdish mothers walking with their children on the street in front of his store.\u201cJapan is such a peaceful country,\u201d Mr. Nishizawa said. \u201cWe should not think about countries, but about the world. We are all citizens of the world, right?\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article referred incorrectly to a group of Kurds killed in June who were pictured in a magazine. They were fighters with Kurdish militant groups, not \u201cKurdish soldiers.\u201dMakiko Inoue contributed reporting from Kawaguchi and Tokyo.Advertisement"}

Besides a fully flatbed seat with direct aisle access, which the airline introduced eight years ago in Delta One, each suite will have a door that slides shut and is as high as the seat.Other amenities in the suite include seats that are wider than the average of 21 inches on existing Delta One classes (for competitive reasons, the airline did not release the specific width); roomy stowage compartments for shoes, headphones and laptops; two consoles so passengers can comfortably spread out their drinks, reading materials and laptops; and an 18-inch-high resolution entertainment monitor, the largest among United States-based carriers, according to the airline, and bigger than the 11- to 15-inch monitors in Delta One classes.Not everything will be new in the all-suite cabins. Passengers on Delta One classes are now served meals created by notable chefs like Linton Hopkins from Atlanta, can choose from wine pairings courtesy of master sommelier Andrea Robinson and receive Tumi amenity kits. These features won\u2019t change.The airline plans to introduce a second all-suite Delta One cabin in spring 2018 in its new Boeing 777 plane and will roll out additional all-suite cabins over the next several years until they are on the airline\u2019s entire fleet of 25 Airbus A350 aircraft and 18 Boeing 777 aircraft.

The imported cholera strain has also spread to other countries in Latin America.On Friday, the office of the secretary general\u2019s spokesman said that efforts to build water and sanitation systems \u201chave been seriously underfunded, and severe and persistent funding shortfalls remain.\u201dThat echoes an internal report by a United Nations adviser, Philip G. Alston, obtained this week and first reported in The New York Times, which helped force the acknowledgment of the United Nations\u2019 involvement in the outbreak.\u201cWhile the United Nations has been keen to emphasize how much it has done in Haiti, the reality is that member states have so far agreed to contribute only 18 percent of the $2.2 billion required to implement\u201d a national cholera eradication plan scheduled to run through 2022, wrote Mr. Alston in his capacity as a special rapporteur.Lawyers representing thousands of Haitian cholera victims petitioned the United Nations directly for relief in 2011, but they were rebuffed.

{"Headline": "Apple Owes $14.5 Billion in Back Taxes to Ireland, E.U. Says", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe European Union on Tuesday ordered Ireland to collect $14.5 billion in unpaid taxes from Apple, a record penalty that worsened tensions with the United States over the bloc\u2019s crackdown on sweetheart deals with global multinationals.Europe\u2019s competition enforcer said that Apple\u2019s illegal deals with the Irish government allowed the technology giant to pay virtually nothing on its European business in some years. The arrangements enabled Apple to funnel profit from two Irish subsidiaries to a \u201chead office\u201d with \u201cno employees, no premises, no real activities,\u201d the commission said.By doing so, Apple paid only 50 euros in taxes for every million euros in profit during 2014. As part of its ruling, Europe demanded that Ireland recoup 10 years\u2019 worth of back taxes, some 13 billion euros, or about $14.5 billion, plus interest.The amount is a drop in the bucket for Apple, which has a total cash pile of more than $230 billion. Even so, the company described the order as a \u201cdevastating blow\u201d to the rule of law. The United States Treasury Department said it jeopardized \u201cthe important spirit of economic partnership between the U.S. and the E.U.\u201dThe United States government is an unlikely advocate. Politicians have berated Apple for paying too little by setting up complex and opaque tax structures. Officials have hit back against corporate mergers that allowed companies to move their headquarters to places like Ireland to take advantage of lower tax rates.But the positioning in the Apple case reflects a political tug of war over big profitable companies, their potential tax bounty and the rights to regulate them.\u201cU.S. companies are the grandmasters of tax avoidance,\u201d said Edward D. Kleinbard, professor at the Gould School of Law at the University of Southern California and a former chief of staff to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.\u201cNevertheless, because of the nature of U.S. politics,\u201d he said, the Apple case \u201cwill be framed by the U.S. as Europe overreaching and discriminating against \u2018our team.\u2019\u201dSince early this year, Ms. Vestager and Jacob J. Lew, the United States Treasury secretary, and their teams have met regularly to discuss Europe\u2019s state-aid tax investigations. Mr. Lew visited Brussels in July to put forward the American perspective.Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, called it a \u201ccheap money grab\u201d by the European Commission, \u201ctargeting U.S. businesses and the U.S. tax base.\u201d The Senate Finance Committee chairman, Orrin G. Hatch, said that the decision \u201cencroaches on U.S. tax jurisdiction.\u201dApple and Ireland had similar defenses.Timothy D. Cook, the chief executive of the technology company, said that Europe\u2019s ruling had \u201cno basis in fact or in law,\u201d and called it an effort to \u201crewrite Apple\u2019s history in Europe, ignore Ireland\u2019s tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process.\u201d The company called the effective tax rate \u201ca completely made-up number.\u201dThe Finance Ministry of Ireland said that the commission\u2019s decision would undermine a continuing global tax overhaul and create business uncertainty. The ministry said that taxes were a \u201cfundamental matter of sovereignty.\u201dIreland and Apple both said they intended to fight Europe\u2019s decision, even though any appeals process could take years.The commission said the amount due in Ireland could be reduced if the American authorities decided that Apple should have paid more tax in the United States. Other countries in the European Union could also potentially take a share.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.\u201cThe ultimate goal should of course be that all companies, big or small, pay tax where they generate their profits,\u201d the competition commissioner, Ms. Vestager, said at a news conference in Brussels on Tuesday. \u201cWe need a change in corporate philosophies and the right legislation to address loopholes and ensure transparency.\u201dAlthough the United States appears to side with Apple and Ireland in this specific fight, the overall view is a bit more complicated.Apple and other companies have also faced criticism for keeping large reserves of cash overseas. The money is not taxed at home until it is brought back to the parent company in the United States.Nonfinancial American companies hold a combined $1.7 trillion in cash overseas, according to the credit rating agency Moody\u2019s. Just the international piece of Apple\u2019s stash amounts to nearly $215 billion.Ireland has faced broad scrutiny for its tax appeal.In a matter separate from the Apple case, the United States Treasury has taken aggressive steps to curtail so-called inversions, a tax move that has significantly benefited Ireland. Under those merger deals, an American company would buy an overseas counterpart and shift its headquarters overseas to lower its taxes.Ireland\u2019s corporate tax rate, at 12.5 percent, is one of the lowest in the developed world. Other incentives and breaks allow companies to cut their bills even further. While it is phasing out some of the more contested loopholes, Ireland has just introduced a new break for profit on intellectual property, a potentially huge benefit to large technology companies with troves of patents.\u201cMany member states are not unhappy about the European Commission\u2019s investigations,\u201d said Philipp Werner, a competition lawyer at Jones Day in Brussels. \u201cThey may help to close down tax havens.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The idea was to discourage banks from stashing their money in the central bank by charging them a modest rate for doing so. Since the banks would lose money rather than earn interest on their deposits, it was hoped they would be prompted instead to make more loans at lower rates to businesses and consumers.It hasn\u2019t worked very well. As many experts predicted at the time, the policy has had only a modest impact on growth. It is also increasingly clear that pushing rates down further wouldn\u2019t help much and could, in fact, increase risks to the global financial system.Meanwhile, continuing to rely on negative rates could be dangerous. The worry among many experts is that banks, institutional investors and even individuals desperate for higher returns might be seduced into taking foolish risks. They might also be tempted to make big investments overseas, driving up the price of stocks and bonds in the United States and Asia and creating bubbles that expose the global financial system and economy to another crisis. Some analysts are already worried about high prices for real estate, stocks and other assets.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Religion Can Lead to Violence", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe StoneBoth Islam and Christianity claim to be revealed religions, holding that their teachings are truths that God himself has conveyed to us and wants everyone to accept. They were, from the start, missionary religions. A religion charged with bringing God\u2019s truth to the world faces the question of how to deal with people who refuse to accept it. To what extent should it tolerate religious error? At certain points in their histories, both Christianity and Islam have been intolerant of other religions, often of each other, even to the point of violence.This was not inevitable, but neither was it an accident. The potential for intolerance lies in the logic of religions like Christianity and Islam that say their teaching derive from a divine revelation. For them, the truth that God has revealed is the most important truth there is; therefore, denying or doubting this truth is extremely dangerous, both for nonbelievers, who lack this essential truth, and for believers, who may well be misled by the denials and doubts of nonbelievers. Given these assumptions, it\u2019s easy to conclude that even extreme steps are warranted to eliminate nonbelief.You may object that moral considerations should limit our opposition to nonbelief. Don\u2019t people have a human right to follow their conscience and worship as they think they should? Here we reach a crux for those who adhere to a revealed religion. They can either accept ordinary human standards of morality as a limit on how they interpret divine teachings, or they can insist on total fidelity to what they see as God\u2019s revelation, even when it contradicts ordinary human standards. Those who follow the second view insist that divine truth utterly exceeds human understanding, which is in no position to judge it. God reveals things to us precisely because they are truths we would never arrive at by our natural lights. When the omniscient God has spoken, we can only obey.For those holding this view, no secular considerations, not even appeals to conventional morality or to practical common sense, can overturn a religious conviction that false beliefs are intolerable. Christianity itself has a long history of such intolerance, including persecution of Jews, crusades against Muslims, and the Thirty Years\u2019 War, in which religious and nationalist rivalries combined to devastate Central Europe. This devastation initiated a move toward tolerance among nations that came to see the folly of trying to impose their religions on foreigners. But intolerance of internal dissidents \u2014 Catholics, Jews, rival Protestant sects \u2014 continued even into the 19th century. (It\u2019s worth noting that in this period the Muslim Ottoman Empire was in many ways more tolerant than most Christian countries.) But Christians eventually embraced tolerance through a long and complex historical process.Critiques of Christian revelation by Enlightenment thinkers like Voltaire, Rousseau and Hume raised serious questions that made non-Christian religions \u2014 and eventually even rejections of religion \u2014 intellectually respectable. Social and economic changes \u2014 including capitalist economies, technological innovations, and democratic political movements \u2014 undermined the social structures that had sustained traditional religion.The eventual result was a widespread attitude of religious toleration in Europe and the United States. This attitude represented ethical progress, but it implied that religious truth was not so important that its denial was intolerable. Religious beliefs and practices came to be regarded as only expressions of personal convictions, not to be endorsed or enforced by state authority. This in effect subordinated the value of religious faith to the value of peace in a secular society. Today, almost all Christians are reconciled to this revision, and many would even claim that it better reflects the true meaning of their religion.There is no central religious authority or overwhelming consensus that excludes such Muslims from Islam. Intolerance need not lead to violence against nonbelievers; but, as we have seen, the logic of revelation readily moves in that direction unless interpretations of sacred texts are subject to nonreligious constraints. Islamic thinkers like Ibn-Sina accepted such constraints, and during the Middle Ages Muslims were often far more tolerant than Christians. But the path of modern tolerance has proved more difficult for Islam than for Christianity, and many Muslims still do not accept the ethical constraints that require religious tolerance, and a significant minority see violence against unbelievers as a divinely ordained duty. We may find it hard to believe that religious beliefs could motivate murders and insist that extreme violence is always due to mental instability or political fanaticism. But the logic (and the history) of religions tells against this view.Advertisement"}

Similarly, the Getty\u2019s offering plan, which was submitted in July 2015, was still awaiting approval by the state\u2019s attorney general as of Aug. 24.The delays can be explained by a design change, said Ran Korolik, the executive vice president of the Victor Group.Originally, the Getty was to have 10 apartments. But interest from a nonresidential tenant in the location, which abuts the elevated High Line and is amid many art galleries, led the developers to add more commercial space while reducing the number of residential units, Mr. Korolik said.Above the galleries, each of the apartments will have two elevators, Mr. Shvo said, plus at least one fireplace. Also, five of the six units will have terraces, including the duplex penthouse, which, according to Mr. Shvo, has a ceiling that stretches to 24 feet.Mr. Marino, who designed the Getty\u2019s checkerboard metal and glass facade, achieved early fame as a designer, in the 1970s, of one of Warhol\u2019s \u201cFactories,\u201d on East 66th Street.

{"Headline": "American Swimmers Pulled Off Plane in Rio", "Date": "2016-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Two American swimmers were pulled off their flight to the United States by the Brazilian authorities and detained for several hours on Wednesday night, Olympic officials said. It was the latest indication that the police were skeptical of the swimmers\u2019 claims that they had been held up at gunpoint during the Rio Games.\u201cWe can confirm that Jack Conger and Gunnar Bentz were removed from their flight to the United States by Brazilian authorities,\u201d a spokesman for the United States Olympic Committee said. \u201cWe are gathering further information.\u201dThe men were released after agreeing to remain in the country and to speak with investigators about the episode on Thursday, according to officials with the United States Olympic team.The idea that such prominent athletes could be robbed by officers during the Olympics was a huge embarrassment for Brazil, underscoring longstanding concerns about holding the Games in a crime-plagued city like Rio de Janeiro.But questions about the Americans\u2019 testimony to the police turned that embarrassment into anger, with many Brazilians wondering whether the athletes had lied about the episode and smeared their country\u2019s reputation.In a conversation on Wednesday with NBC\u2019s Matt Lauer, Mr. Lochte \u2014 who has already returned to the United States \u2014 changed certain details of his account. After previously saying that an assailant had put a gun against his forehead, he said that the gun had been aimed in his \u201cgeneral direction.\u201dMr. Lochte had also previously said that the swimmers had been robbed after the men identifying themselves as police officers pulled over their taxi. On Wednesday, however, he told NBC that the taxi had stopped at a gas station so they could use the bathroom.Brazilian investigators said video evidence and witnesses showed that American swimmers had fabricated their account of being held up at gunpoint in Rio.The episode has created a significant test for the newly collaborative relationship between American and Brazilian law enforcement officials. In the months leading up to the Olympics, the countries worked closely as they tried to improve Brazil\u2019s ability to thwart a terrorist attack. But on Wednesday night, American officials seemed to be in the dark over the detention of Mr. Conger and Mr. Bentz.\u201cWe have seen media reports that two U.S. citizen athletes were detained,\u201d said John Kirby, a State Department spokesman. \u201cWe stand ready to provide all appropriate consular assistance.\u201dHours after the swimmers were removed from the plane, it was unclear where they were being held. When asked if United States Olympic officials knew where the American swimmers were, the U.S.O.C. spokesman, Patrick Sandusky, said, \u201cAt this point we are gathering details and have no further comment.\u201dBrazilian law enforcement officials have kept American diplomatic and law enforcement officials at arm\u2019s length as they have moved forward with their investigation, according to senior American officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to be identified discussing a continuing Brazilian investigation.Earlier Wednesday, a Brazilian judge issued an order to prevent Mr. Lochte, a 12-time Olympic medalist, and Jimmy Feigen, the fourth swimmer involved, from leaving the country as doubts emerged about their statements.Mr. Sandusky declined to comment when asked why United States Olympics officials had allowed Mr. Conger and Mr. Bentz to board a plane leaving Brazil despite the continuing investigation.Agents from Brazil\u2019s Federal Police, an investigative force that oversees the country\u2019s borders, detained Mr. Conger and Mr. Bentz at Rio de Janeiro\u2019s main international airport, according to local news reports. Investigators from Rio\u2019s Tourism Police had asked for their passports to be seized so they could be questioned.Shortly after they were removed from the plane, the two men were shown on the Globo television network being escorted to a police station in the airport. They declined to talk to a television reporter at the entrance to the station.Investigators have not found evidence corroborating the swimmers\u2019 account, according to local news reports, prompting the judge\u2019s order to seize their passports.\u201cYou can see the supposed victims arriving without signs of being physically or psychologically shaken, even joking amongst themselves,\u201d Judge Keyla Blanc de Cnop said in a statement, referring to video of the swimmers returning to the Olympic Village after the party.The Brazilian authorities have come under scrutiny after a number of armed assaults during the Games, despite the deployment of an 85,000-member security force to ease fears about violent crime.Mr. Sandusky said that the police had looked for the two swimmers on Wednesday, but that the athletes were no longer at the Olympic Village.\u201cThe swim team moved out of the village after their competition ended, so we were not able to make the athletes available,\u201d Mr. Sandusky said. He added that the Olympic Committee\u2019s security protocol prevented him from confirming the athletes\u2019 current locations.Mr. Lochte\u2019s lawyer, Jeff Ostrow, denied assertions that his client and the other swimmers might have fabricated details of their accounts, describing such claims as efforts by Brazilian officials to deflect criticism of problems in Rio.\u201cThe country has a dark cloud over it for a million and one reasons, from their economy to their crime to their management of the Olympics,\u201d said Mr. Ostrow, who is based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. \u201cMy client has cooperated thoroughly with the Brazilian authorities and stands behind his statement.\u201dStill, there was growing speculation in Brazil that the episode might not have unfolded as the swimmers described it.He also told USA Today that the swimmers did not initially tell the United States Olympic Committee about what had happened \u201cbecause we were afraid we\u2019d get into trouble.\u201dMr. Lochte and Mr. Feigen told Brazilian investigators that they left the party at Club France, which was set up to promote the country during the Games, around 4 a.m. Sunday, according to local news reports.There are other points of confusion in the accounts by Mr. Lochte and Mr. Feigen, the only swimmers who provided testimony to Brazilian investigators.The men, who said they had been intoxicated upon leaving the party, said they could not remember the color of the taxi they took, or where exactly the assault had taken place. Investigators have been unable to find the taxi driver who delivered the swimmers back to the village.A prosecutor in Rio, Andr\u00e9 Buonora, said in a statement that the swimmers could face charges of providing false testimony if they had lied to investigators.Despite the controversy, it is not uncommon for the police in Rio to be implicated in armed assaults.\u201cSo the American swimmer lied about the robbery?\u201d Mariana Godoy, a television news announcer, asked in a Twitter post. She implied that Lochte was trying to cover up something untoward.\u201cHe left one party and went to \u2018another party\u2019 and didn\u2019t want to tell Mommy about it?\u201d Ms. Godoy wrote.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the given name of an American swimmer. He is Townley Haas, not Tommy.Simon Romero reported from Rio de Janeiro, and Michael S. Schmidt from Washington. Paula Moura contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Even Superheroes Punch the Clock", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn summertime, you can count on two things. There will be a lot of sequels and reboots in theaters, and there will be a lot of critics complaining about that. It\u2019s just part of the job. And after 2015, when a handful of reboots and sequels landed on Top 10 lists, we\u2019re back to a familiar routine. The movies range from pretty good to outright terrible, they open to mixed reviews and big box-office numbers, and before we know it, the Oscar race is heating up. It\u2019s the end of civilization, and it\u2019s also business as usual.The sameness of this year\u2019s franchise movies is striking, though. I don\u2019t just mean that their pleasures seem more routine than revelatory, or that they feature climactic scenes so similar as to be almost identical. Look, a giant thing is shooting swirls of green light! A vortex is threatening to swallow a whole city! Guys have dropped their super-high-tech weapons and are duking it out with fists! I\u2019m talking more about grand, overarching themes. No, not the battle of good against evil or the existential angst of the lonely hero. Something more profound, or at least more relevant: the problems of management and morale in the modern office.This summer, your local multiplex is home to an extended business seminar. There are sessions on crisis-management and how to deal with office romances (\u201cStar Trek Beyond\u201d); on office rivalries and mission-statement drafting (\u201cCaptain America: Civil War\u201d); on start-ups (\u201cGhostbusters\u201d) and I.T. disasters (\u201cJason Bourne\u201d). Every action movie is a workplace sitcom in disguise.None of this is entirely new. Nothing in popular culture, or in consumer capitalism, is ever really new. Superhero team-building is a venerable comic-book practice, one that flourished in the \u201960s and \u201970s \u2014 with the Avengers, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four \u2014 more or less contemporaneously with the first voyages of the Starship Enterprise. The Enterprise, though, is a convenient template, because it provides a setting that resembles an actual office, with screens and workstations and a dress code. The ship is a subsidiary of a multiplanetary body called the Federation, in principle a utopian political entity but in practice more akin to a modern diversified corporation, with global (that is, galactic) reach and a complex bureaucratic structure. Captain Kirk is a division head whose responsibilities include dealing with external crises that are variously comical, outlandish and harrowing. But the bulk of his job is keeping the Enterprise running from one installment to the next, which means attending to infrastructure and human (or Vulcan) resources.For its time \u2014 the distant future but also, in terrestrial terms, what we now think of as the \u201cMad Men\u201d era \u2014 the Enterprise was a fairly diverse workplace. In retrospect, the crew\u2019s composition might look like tokenism, but cultural differences were also integral to the show\u2019s ethos and structure. And the new run of \u201cStar Trek\u201d movies builds on the original\u2019s multiculturalism, presenting an idealized and mostly harmonious workplace where differences are respected and the hot buttons of race, gender and sexuality remain for the most part unpushed.Collegiality is a fragile and mysterious thing. It can\u2019t be quantified or mandated, and it doesn\u2019t figure prominently in public discussions of work. Political discourse, reasonably enough, is preoccupied with unemployment and wages, with matters of policy and economics. Just as work claims more and more of our lives, so does the lived texture of work occupy an ever larger place in the pop-cultural imagination. It\u2019s all about meetings, deadlines, impossible tasks, scary or clueless bosses and, above all, the people in the next cubicle, with whom we spend most of our waking hours, even when we\u2019re trying to avoid them.The number of TV series set in workplaces is beyond counting. \u201cParks and Recreation,\u201d \u201cThe Office\u201d and \u201c30 Rock\u201d have joined \u201cThe Dick Van Dyke Show,\u201d \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show\u201d and \u201cTaxi\u201d in the rearview mirror, but real and metaphorical workplaces are everywhere you look, from Westeros to the White Houses of \u201cScandal,\u201d \u201cVeep\u201d and \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201dThe migration of this model onto the big screen can be taken as evidence of the ascendance of television in the 21st-century popular culture. The prevalence of ensemble-based, job-oriented big-budget movies can also be seen as an update of the westerns and platoon pictures of the \u201940s and \u201950s. But those movies were reflections of the realities of the postwar political economy. The frontier and the battlefield were allegorical spaces where Cold War anxieties were played out, but they were also representations of the offices where more and more Americans spent more and more of their time.Part of what makes work tolerable is the idea that it is heroic, the fantasy that repetitive and meaningless tasks are charged with risk and significance. Pecking away at our keyboards, we\u2019re cowboys, warriors, superheroes. But meanwhile, superheroics look like every other job. The alienated, misunderstood individuals \u2014 the white guys struggling with the burdens of power \u2014 who defined the genre in the early 2000s have for the most part been absorbed into larger affiliations. It\u2019s a team sport now, and the movies are about the dynamics within the team itself. Are things cool between Harley Quinn and Deadshot? Can Kirk keep the peace between Bones and Spock? Will Iron Man and Captain America patch up their differences? Will the Ghostbusters?External threats have been replaced by internal conflicts. The main baddie in \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d is a renegade recruit, the Enchantress, who in her less volatile and more demurely costumed state is June Moone, Rick Flag\u2019s girlfriend. So the demons-from-Hell business is a personnel issue after all, and hence a special challenge for Waller. It also turns out that the arch-villain in \u201cStar Trek Beyond,\u201d Idris Elba\u2019s Krall, is a former Federation officer who didn\u2019t like the direction the organization was going. A disgruntled employee. A malcontent Luddite. An enemy of innovation. In the final battle, Kirk helps him negotiate a severance package.Also: The movie is boring. All of these movies are boring. And that is not a shortcoming. Rather, it\u2019s part of the program and part of the reason we keep showing up. By \u201cwe,\u201d I don\u2019t mean those of us who are, absurdly, paid to attend movies and complain about them, but the rank and file of devoted and casual fans, the strivers and slackers who keep the enterprise airborne. We go to hang out with people we know and mostly like \u2014 it\u2019s easier that way \u2014 and hope that the experience is not too stressful. It doesn\u2019t have to be great, just good enough to keep us from striking out on our own or banding together to overthrow a rotten and oppressive system. Ha ha. Just kidding. Everything\u2019s cool. Buy a ticket. Punch the clock. It\u2019s only a movie. You\u2019re just doing your job.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Weighing the Strengths and Shortcomings of China\u2019s Education System", "Date": "2016-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySinosphereYour study finds that Chinese students begin college with some of the strongest critical thinking skills in the world, far outpacing their peers in the United States and Russia. But they lose that advantage after two years. What is going on?It\u2019s a good news, bad news story. The good news: Whatever the heck they do in high school, whether you like it or not, they are teaching massive numbers of kids math, physics and some type of critical thinking skills. What drives me crazy is they\u2019re not learning anything in college. There are no incentives for the kids to work hard. Everyone graduates.Why are high schools doing a better job than colleges?In high school, parents provide oversight. If they don\u2019t think their kid\u2019s being pushed hard, they\u2019re the first ones on the phone, the first ones standing at the teacher\u2019s desk. From the teacher\u2019s view, they have a huge incentive to get their students through the curriculum and get through the tests.Say you are appointed to lead a university in China. What is the first thing you change?In the United States, we get rewarded for good teaching. Your promotions and salary raises depend on you getting good evaluations from students, on performing well in the classroom and winning awards. That\u2019s every bit as important as publishing research. In China, that\u2019s not happening. The professors we work with say, \u201cWhy should we push the kids if they\u2019re going to graduate anyway?\u201dWe plan to study creativity in our next round of exams, and it will be very interesting to see how the Chinese and the other East Asian students perform. A lot of people would say the gaokao is a fair system. Some reforms are needed for the one-test-score-does-all model. We need to reduce the pressure somewhat and to focus teaching on producing better-rounded children.If you were in a room with China\u2019s top leaders, what advice would you give them about the education system?I\u2019d ask: \u201cWhy isn\u2019t everybody going to high school? How do we get everybody to go to high school?\u201d It\u2019s a rural problem. Then you ask yourself, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t these rural kids going to high school?\u201d Well, it\u2019s because 10, 15, 20 percent of them drop out of junior high school. They aren\u2019t even finishing junior high.What is happening in middle school?This isn\u2019t India, where half the teachers are absent, or Africa, where they haven\u2019t been able to improve the quality of teaching. In China, you\u2019ve got good facilities and good teachers. The curriculum in rural areas is the same as the best that\u2019s taught to the city kids. So what is it?What our work shows very clearly is that it\u2019s really the matter of the individual kids in rural areas. They\u2019re sick. They\u2019ve got uncorrected myopia, malnutrition, anemia and intestinal worms. Forty percent of children in our sample in Guizhou have worms in their stomach. How do you study in elementary school if you\u2019ve got worms in your stomach?At the same time, prosperity is rising and China has become more urban.This is the irony. They have the fastest-growing economy in terms of wealth in Asia. But the kids are a victim of China\u2019s own success. China really grew so fast, and they\u2019ve invested in resources and teachers. But they\u2019ve left behind the human element.Advertisement"}

Rural Voters Don\u2019t Forget.", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKAZAMABIKA, Gabon \u2014 For months, Jacqueline Gnagne carefully tended the cassava, corn and peanuts she planted inside a national park. Rangers helped her string barbed wire to protect her crops. Just before harvest time, she even moved into a small cabin at the edge of the field so she could keep a 24-hour watch.Every night she waited. At the first sound of breaking branches, she beat on a metal drum that echoed through the forest of Lop\u00e9 National Park. It was no use. The elephants came anyway. A baby managed to squeeze in between the fence wires. Its mother followed, barreling through. They ate everything.Furious, Ms. Gnagne, the chief of the village down the road, phoned government parks officials who protect the endangered elephants.\u201cLook at what your children have done,\u201d Ms. Gnagne fumed.Mr. Bongo, whose family has held Gabon\u2019s presidency since the Lyndon B. Johnson era, has earned international praise for his commitment to conservation.But as he faces re-election on Saturday, his efforts have earned him something else as well: resentment from many residents who complain that he worries too much about wild animals and not enough about them.Some potential voters said they planned to sit out the vote in protest, repeating a common refrain that can be heard in the forests and on city streets alike: Let the elephants vote for him instead.\u201cElephants can live everywhere; that\u2019s not our problem here,\u201d said Claude Somand-Mayila, who lives in a poor neighborhood in the capital, Libreville. \u201cThere are no jobs in this country. Zero, zero, zero. I\u2019m looking for a change, but there is no change.\u201dTrying to step out from the shadow of his father\u2019s nearly 42-year rule, Mr. Bongo says he wants to win over the population on the basis of his own accomplishments. And in many areas of the heavily forested nation, elephants are standing in the way.So this month, Mr. Bongo brought in electric fencing experts from Kenya to string wires to protect the crops of Ms. Gnagne\u2019s tiny village, a pilot project that he says could be deployed in other villages inside the forest.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to leave anyone by the side of the road,\u201d said Mr. Bongo in an interview at his seaside presidential palace in Libreville.Many people already feel like he has.Mr. Bongo\u2019s conservation efforts are well known abroad. He banned commercial fishing off coastal waters to establish an enormous marine protected area. He expanded the number of rangers and other employees in the national parks, to 750 from 60, to fight illegal logging and poaching in some of the most pristine forests in the world. He is a regular at international climate and conservation conferences.But the president\u2019s passion for trees and animals has also flummoxed many residents in a nation that suffers from tremendous inequality.In a neighborhood of the capital called C\u00e9i, abandoned, rusting cars seem to melt into dirt streets lined by apartment buildings with broken windows and crumbling balconies. A river of trash and sewage winds through the neighborhood. Not far away, government ministers cruise down a coastal highway in Mercedes SUVs.A 2013 McKinsey report commissioned by the government of Gabon classified 30 percent of the Gabonese population as vulnerable, living on about $140 a month.Mr. Bongo said he took the report to heart. In 2014, he said his government created $500 million in new health and education programs, including 40,000 scholarships, aimed at improving quality of life.Mr. Bongo has tried to distance himself from the lavishness that was a hallmark of his father, whose tenure was best known for enriching himself and the loyal elite.Mr. Bongo promised to build a university with money from the real estate sale. He said construction on it and three other universities would start next year. A new mining school opened this summer.Many of Mr. Bongo\u2019s efforts have yet to trickle down to residents, particularly in Libreville, where dense treetops give way to flat tin roofs of ramshackle shacks that stretch across the horizon. Mr. Bongo is urging patience.\u201cThe cities are where the poverty really mostly is,\u201d Mr. Bongo said. \u201cWe have started programs to fight that.\u201dMr. Bongo\u2019s elephant fence project is a small piece of a sweeping plan he said he created to shift Gabon from its heavy reliance on oil revenues. Low prices have caused Gabon to fall behind in payments on government contracts. But even more worrisome, the country\u2019s oil reserves are dwindling.Mr. Bongo has banned the export of timber to encourage local processing, and, for the first time, the country has begun processing its own manganese. The export of all raw natural resources will be banned by 2020.Oil now accounts for about 27 percent of gross domestic product, down from 40 to 50 percent in years past.\u201cOur economic model was too simplistic; it was based on exporting,\u201d said R\u00e9gis Immongault Tatagani, Gabon\u2019s minister of the economy. \u201cOur new model is based on transforming the resources in our country.\u201dExpanding agriculture is one central element. Most of Gabon\u2019s tiny population of 1.7 million lives in a handful of crowded cities. Mr. Bongo wants to lure them back to the land.A new cooperative program offers training, financing and several acres to anyone who will uproot themselves to work the land in rural areas. At least 13,000 people have enrolled, said Gagan Gupta, country director for Olam International, an agriculture company partnering with the government on the program.But no one can farm successfully if the nation\u2019s 40,000 forest elephants eat the harvest.In Ms. Gnagne\u2019s village, which was settled in the forest long before it became a national park, signs of elephant invasion on a recent morning were everywhere. Bushes were trampled. Heaps of dung were visible.Nearby, workers were installing the 125-acre, solar-powered wire perimeter that packs enough voltage to scare off a two-and-a-half ton elephant.\u201cWe could avoid importing $800 million dollars\u2019 worth of food if we can get agriculture going,\u201d said Lee White, Gabon\u2019s director of national parks.With the new fence, Mr. Bongo said he was trying to balance the needs of the population with his passion for conservation.It is the same philosophy Mr. Bongo said he applied when creating a palm oil plantation, though those kinds of projects are often criticized by conservationists because the operations swallow trees and animal habitats.Officials used new satellite technology to identify a site for the 250,000-acre operation that they said would do the least damage to biodiversity. The government said it expected the project to create 12,000 jobs.Mr. Bongo is also hoping to lure investors to his new economic zone, where they can operate tax-free for 10 years. So far it has 91 companies, which employ about 1,000 Gabonese workers, said Jasveer Singh, chief executive of the zone.On a recent afternoon, workers punched in at Gabon Wood Industries, a company with Malaysian investors that processes timber. All but 11 of 82 employees of the company are Gabonese.\u201cI\u2019m voting for the president,\u201d said Kombe Gustave, who was one of them. \u201cHe\u2019s for all the people, for the Gabonese.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lotte Executive Found Dead Amid South Korean Corruption Inquiry", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 A top executive at the Lotte Group, one of South Korea\u2019s largest family-controlled conglomerates, was found dead on Friday in an apparent suicide, hours before he was scheduled to appear before prosecutors investigating allegations of corruption at the company.The body of the executive, the vice chairman Lee In-won, a close confidant of Lotte\u2019s chairman, Shin Dong-bin, was found under a tree on a riverside footpath in Yangpyeong, near Seoul, the capital, police said. Police said that they believed Mr. Lee hanged himself with a necktie and scarf, but that they planned an autopsy. Lotte also confirmed Mr. Lee\u2019s death.Police said that they had found a suicide note in Mr. Lee\u2019s car, Yonhap, the national news agency, reported. Mr. Lee had left his home in Seoul on Thursday evening, telling his family that he was going out for exercise, Yonhap reported.The death of Mr. Lee, 69, came just as prosecutors were stepping up their investigation into Lotte. They questioned another senior Lotte executive, Hwang Kag-gyu, on Thursday. The questioning of the executives was widely seen as a precursor to the summoning of Mr. Shin, who controls Lotte, the fifth largest among the chaebol, or family-controlled conglomerates, that dominate the South Korean economy.The pressure on Lotte illustrates the latest challenge to South Korea\u2019s chaebol, which are important to the Asian country\u2019s economy. In previous decades they helped turbocharge South Korea\u2019s economy and make it an industrial powerhouse. But their conduct has come under increasingly scrutiny in recent years, with officials worrying that recurring allegations of corruption and other misbehavior among the families controlling them could further stoke public discontent over growth income inequality and a slowing economy.Partly working on tips resulting from the sibling squabble, prosecutors raided Lotte offices in June to collect evidence of a slush fund the group was accused of creating through illegal deals among subsidiaries. Lotte has said it is cooperating.In July, Shin Young-ja, a 73-year-old sister of the Lotte chairman, was arrested on charges of accepting bribes from a local cosmetics company that sought access to Lotte\u2019s duty-free outlets.In South Korea, prominent people targeted in criminal investigations have occasionally ended their own lives, apparently trying to avoid public humiliation and imprisonment or to thwart investigations and protect their families or companies.In 2003, Chung Mong-hun, the chairman of the Hyundai Group, killed himself by leaping from his 12th-floor office window as he faced arrest on charges tied to the $500 million his company had sent to North Korea to win business rights. Roh Moo-hyun, the former president of South Korea, killed himself by jumping off a cliff near his retirement home in 2009 after he was questioned by state prosecutors in connection with a corruption scandal. In April 2015, a businessman named Sung Wan-jong hanged himself from a tree hours before he was scheduled to appear before prosecutors seeking corruption charges.Mr. Lee, widely regarded as the No. 2 in Lotte, was one of the professional executives commonly known in South Korea as vassals, for their loyalty to the families that control the business empires. These executives rarely betray their bosses during corruption investigations.In the note found in Mr. Lee\u2019s car, he remained loyal to Mr. Shin, calling him \u201ca respectable man\u201d and apologizing to Lotte employees and managers for leaving them in a crisis, Yonhap reported. Mr. Lee also denied that Lotte operated a slush fund.There was no immediate reaction from Mr. Shin.Prosecutors expressed condolences for Mr. Lee\u2019s death. They had planned to question him as they considered charges of embezzlement and breach of trust in connection with the alleged slush fund for Mr. Shin and helping him and his father evade taxes.Mr. Lee joined Lotte in 1973 and rapidly climbed Lotte\u2019s hierarchy under Shin Kyuk-ho.

{"Headline": "The Superglue Diet: How to Make a Lighter, Fuel-Sipping Car", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsDETROIT \u2014 The 2017 GMC Acadia sport utility vehicle that is just starting to arrive in dealerships around the country is 700 pounds lighter than the version it replaces, and can go 23 miles on a gallon of gasoline, up from 18 m.p.g., a 28 percent improvement.One of the secrets to the big weight loss? Glue.Many of the steel parts of the Acadia\u2019s underbody are held together not by rivets or welds but by advanced adhesives similar to those used in modern airplanes like the Boeing Dreamliner. Since this ultra-superglue bonds parts together all along the seam where they connect, not just in certain spots, the parts become stiffer. Because of the stiffness, General Motors is able in many cases to switch to thinner steel, helping the new Acadia shed pounds.The grades of steel are thinner by only about the width of a human hair, but \u201cit\u2019s all the little things that add up to the big number,\u201d said Charlie Klein, executive director of G.M.\u2019s global carbon-emissions reduction strategy.Automakers are racing to improve fuel efficiency to meet the increasing mileage standards that environmental regulators have set for the next nine years. Space-age adhesives are being used more widely, just one of the many leaps manufacturers are taking to reduce weight and save fuel.But to continue their gains, automakers must find additional innovations. One promising technology on the horizon is a new type of gas-electric hybrid that draws power from a 48-volt battery, which is more powerful than a standard 12-volt auto battery but less expensive and less complicated than the power packs of 200 volts or more found in hybrids like the Toyota Prius.The 48-volt battery drives an electric motor that gives the engine an extra 20 or so horsepower, cutting fuel use in starts and acceleration.Mary Gustanski, vice president of engineering and program management at Delphi, an auto supplier that is going to produce 48-volt systems for car companies, believes these hybrids can improve the fuel economy of normal gasoline-powered cars by 15 percent or more with little additional cost. \u201cIs it leaps and bounds?\u201d she said. \u201cNo, but does it move us further along? Definitely.\u201dHyundai Motor, the Korean automaker, is \u201cworking very hard on 48-volt technology,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Brien, the company\u2019s vice president of corporate and product planning. He declined to say when those cars would be on the market. G.M. also expects to offer 48-volt cars in the United States market in the next few years, an executive said.Ms. Gustanski said Delphi\u2019s technology would first appear in Europe and China in 2018. Continental, another supplier, plans to begin producing 48-volt systems for automakers by the end of this year.Even with new technologies, automakers still have a steep uphill climb to keep pace with gas-mileage targets. By 2025, they are supposed to sell a fleet of vehicles that hits an average of 54.5 miles per gallon.That number is based on a complicated formula that gives credits for reducing emissions from air-conditioners and selling electric vehicles, among other things. In real-world driving, the target equals a fleet average of about 40 miles per gallon. The average for cars and light trucks that were sold in July was 25.4 miles per gallon, according to the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute.Last month, a joint report from the Environmental Protection Agency and the Transportation Department said automakers were probably able to reach only an average rating of about 50 miles per gallon by 2025 \u2014 about 36 miles per gallon in real-world situations.The main problem is that low gasoline prices and the absence of high fuel taxes that are common in most other advanced industrial nations have enticed Americans to move away from cars and buy more pickup trucks and S.U.V.s, which score lower on fuel efficiency.Missing the 2025 target would result in higher levels of carbon dioxide emissions, which regulators are trying to reduce in a bid to battle climate change.Regulators have just begun a review of the fuel-efficiency standards and by April 2018 must decide whether to ease them in some ways \u2014 a path automakers would prefer \u2014 or leave them unchanged.Automakers and regulators are at odds. At an industry conference in Michigan earlier this month, the E.P.A.\u2019s director for air quality, Christopher Grundler, shrugged off suggestions that the 2025 target should be lowered. He said the standards were \u201cworking spectacularly,\u201d and noted that carmakers had made good progress and already offered many models that met the 2025 level.These include hybrid and plug-in models from Ford Motor, Hyundai, Toyota and others, as well as pure electric vehicles like Tesla models and G.M.\u2019s Chevrolet Bolt. Ford\u2019s aluminum-bodied F-150 pickup truck, when equipped with the company\u2019s EcoBoost V6 engine, comes close to the 2025 requirement \u2014 23 miles per gallon in real-world driving \u2014 for vehicles of that size.Automakers agree that electric cars offer impressive fuel-economy numbers, but counter that consumers buy too few of them to move the average number. The big challenge, they say, is in improving fuel economy in conventional gasoline-powered cars without adding so much cost that consumers turn away.\u201cIt is going to be extremely difficult for traditional powertrains to hit those targets in the last couple of years\u201d leading to 2025, said Richard L. Gezelle, a senior program manager at Toyota.Toyota is one automaker that has less interest in 48-volt \u201cmild\u201d hybrids, as they are known in the industry. Mr. Gezelle said his company thought automakers would need to focus more on breakthrough technologies \u2014 such as electric cars and hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles \u2014 that can meet the 2025 standard and continue improving fuel efficiency beyond then.For now, automakers are making gains from a series of technologies they started introducing about six years ago. These include shrinking the size of engines while adding turbocharging, which increases power and efficiency by forcing extra air into an engine. This approach enables a 4-cylinder engine to put out about the same power as a traditional V6, and a V6 to replace a V8.At the same time, automakers are hoping for advancements from a new wave of innovations. They include:Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz Says the Euro Needs Big Reform", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.The nasty headlines from across the Atlantic \u2014 Brexit, terrorism, debt crises \u2014 almost make us forget that these were supposed to be Europe\u2019s salad days. With a common currency and increasing integration, Europe was, finally, bidding adieu to cross-border conflict and economic crisis. Turmoil and strife were so very 20th century; the future was to be only digital apps and polyglot cafes.Well, they still have Chartres, and they still have Goethe. They also have millions of migrants, rising nationalism, recurrent recessions and plummeting birthrates. What went wrong?Stiglitz is not speaking about the obvious fact that 19 independent states use a common currency, but about their failure so far to create the quilt of institutions and shared regulations to make it work. This sounds wonky, and though Stiglitz spews plenty of populist rhetoric, \u201cThe Euro\u201d is thick with dense paragraphs (imagine an economics text written by Michael Moore). Still, the underlying idea is \u00adsimple.American states like Alabama and Vermont certainly differ from one another, but they benefit from a shared political fabric far more than, say, Belgium and Greece. Stiglitz\u2019s main point is that for the euro to work \u2014 and for \u201cEurope\u201d to work \u2014 its nation-states will have to function more like American states.If Americans think of the euro at all, it\u2019s typically to marvel at its convenience for tourists, though those of a certain age may harbor nostalgia for the francs, lire and pesetas with which we trekked from hostel to chateau. But all those quaint notes were a planner\u2019s nightmare. Depending on the rate of exchange, a German could afford to buy wine from Burgundy or olive oil from Tuscany one month but not the next. The euro fixed all that.The problem is that currency fluctuations were a useful escape valve. What if France entered into a severe recession while the German economy remained robust? Thanks to the laws of Adam Smith, the franc would drop relative to the mark, and voil\u00e0, Germans would buy more Perrier and Peugeots, and the imbalance would start to correct. Now, France has no currency to depreciate.Ah, the careful reader will say, then why do the individual American states (which are similarly locked into a single currency) function better? What\u2019s the safety valve for Rhode Island or Mississippi?Actually, there are several. If the price of oil is slumping, Texas oilmen will contribute less to the federal budget; some of the tab will be picked up by citizens in states that are doing better. And since more people in Texas will be eligible for federal welfare programs, like unemployment insurance, federal outlays will increase. These programs act as automatic stabilizers.Europe lacks such stabilizers. The common budget is only 1 percent of Europe\u2019s economy, a stark contrast to America, where the federal budget is roughly 20 percent. Thus, countries like Greece that are suffering hard times have nowhere to turn. Stiglitz argues for \u201cmore Europe,\u201d meaning an expanded budget and common welfare programs, and a mutualized system of deposit insurance (so that failing Greek banks are not dependent merely on other failing Greek banks, but on healthy German ones as well).This part of Stiglitz\u2019s argument is conventional. So is his diagnosis \u2014 that the European leaders who implemented the euro in the 1990s did so largely for political reasons (getting rid of the mark was France\u2019s price for accepting a reunified Germany). And Stiglitz\u2019s moral \u2014 \u201cBe careful not to let economic integration outpace political integration\u201d \u2014 is well stated.However, that textbook argument against the euro is only part of Stiglitz\u2019s brief. He also takes aim at the \u201ctroika\u201d of policy institutions (the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission) for obsessing over inflation rather than job creation. He is right to indict the drones in Brussels and the bankers in Berlin for imposing budget austerity and unrealistic debt repayment schedules (he likens them to \u201cmedieval bloodletters\u201d). Herbert Hoover didn\u2019t lick the Depression, and austerity hasn\u2019t worked in Greece. Stiglitz is also right to fault the European project, in general, for its nondemocratic character.But his attacks on the troika devolve into a sort of rant against neoliberal capitalism. Markets ain\u2019t perfect; they need to be regulated, and the losers in a market system need to be protected.Yet the market remains the best social construct for pricing goods and rationing demand. Stiglitz accuses the troika of being motivated by its supposed enmity for government. He, on the other hand, shows his mistrust for the market on practically every page. He wants bank credit decisions screened according to his own political criteria. He berates industry for investing in \u201ccapital-intensive techniques of production, contributing, over the long run, to unemployment.\u201d (That was also said about the tractor.) He faults the troika for following a political agenda instead of a neutral policy, yet repeatedly urges European leaders to tilt the scales in favor of small and medium-size businesses as opposed to \u201cbig corporations.\u201d If these are not political criteria, what are?Many of his charges have a vague, rhetorical air. He throws around words like \u201cmonopolist\u201d without specifics. He writes that unnamed \u201cGreek oligarchs\u201d had \u201ca controlling interest in banks and the media and were exploiting the linkages between the two.\u201d Which banks?And when he says, repeatedly, that the troika was wrong about government spending being a major cause of the crisis, because Spain and Ireland saw their economies implode over free-market errors, he runs into a problem. The problem is that Greece, which suffered the worst crisis, and is the example on which Stiglitz spills the most ink, was largely caused by its bloated public sector. Stiglitz admits this.Far from the measured analysis that one might expect from a renowned economist, \u201cThe Euro\u201d has the strident tone of a political pamphlet. Italics are everywhere, as if the reader were being screamed at. There is a numbing incantation of faults attributed to the troika (did they do anything right?). And Stiglitz uses the unfortunate tactic of impugning his adversaries\u2019 motives; the troika is not merely wrong, it is guilty of \u201chypocrisy,\u201d of \u201cdishonesty\u201d and of \u201csheer hypocrisy\u201d \u2014 and that\u2019s all within two pages.Stiglitz even descends to slurs evoking the Nazi era. Taking issue with Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany\u2019s finance minister, for emphasizing economic rules, Stiglitz says, \u201cOf course, many of the most heinous crimes have been committed by those who simply said they were just obeying rules.\u201d His bias against wealthy European states, Germany in particular, subtly infects the book. Stiglitz generally presents Greece as Germany\u2019s victim, rather than as an actor in its own depression; he says Germany\u2019s trade surplus forces Greece, and others, to run deficits (if one country is a net seller, someone else must be a net buyer). It would be equally true to say that Greece\u2019s deficit imposes on Germany the burden of running a surplus. The fact is, German industry is more productive.None of this undermines Stiglitz\u2019s argument that Europe needs a redivision of currencies to rebalance trade. Although Stiglitz would like to see \u201cmore Europe\u201d \u2014 that is, common rules and institutions and even a common tax framework so the euro can work \u2014 he doubts that the political will exists. In its absence, he would splinter the euro into, say, two or three currencies, perhaps trading freely, perhaps (a less draconian break) trading only within limited bounds, until the day when the continent is ready to attempt a single currency again. Either way, Europe is having its Articles of Confederation moment. Its leaders should grasp that superimposing one financial system on 19 political fiefs cannot work.Roger Lowenstein is the author, most recently, of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Bank: The Epic Struggle to Create the Federal Reserve.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Can America Recover From Donald Trump?", "Date": "2016-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialIt could be that the polls are right, and Mr. Trump will go down in flames. But while that will solve an immediate problem, a larger one will remain. The message of hatred and paranoia that is inciting millions of voters will outlast the messenger. The toxic effects of Trumpism will have to be addressed.Yes, Mr. Trump speaks frontier gibberish. Outright nativism remains a fringe American phenomenon. But there is no shortage of mainstream politicians who have endorsed his message by endorsing the Republican nominee. Anyone hoping to build a serious solution to immigration after this election will have to confront the unworkable ideas and vicious emotions that Mr. Trump, with many enablers, has dragged into the open.It seems like a century ago, but it was only 2001 when a Republican president, George W. Bush, began talking about a once-in-a-generation overhaul of the outdated American immigration laws. He sought a bipartisan consensus to boost the economy and make millions right with the law. Then came 9/11. Though sensible immigration reform gained the broad support of the American public, legislation in Congress repeatedly failed, ambushed by hard-core Republican partisans.This year brought the fever dream of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, where speaker after speaker presented a vision of foreigners stealing across the border to rob, rape and kill. Cued by Mr. Trump, they scapegoated immigrants and refugees in general and Latinos and Muslims in particular. The crowd cheered for Sheriff Joe Arpaio, brutalizer of Arizona Latinos, and Rudolph Giuliani, who hollered about terrorists and criminals as if running for mayor of Gotham City.Optimists, eyes on the polls, hope that Mr. Trump, in losing, will discredit these views and that Republicans next year will sue for peace. Under this scenario Hillary Clinton and Paul Ryan or whoever is running Congress will move fast to push forward a rational immigration reform bill.Remember, though, the post-mortem that found Republicans chastened after the more genteel nativism of the 2012 Mitt Romney campaign. The last vestiges of that contrition vanished as Mr. Trump, warning about Mexican rapists, vaulted atop the polls.Trump supporters have now been promised a nation where non-natives, and their children, are locked outside the borders forever. They have been promised, inside a new wall, new factories where everyone will build things, speak only English and be rich. What will happen when they learn that none of this is real?The challenge to responsible leaders of any political party will be to separate the economic discontent from the bigotry and paranoia that are the key to the Trump phenomenon. The question to future Republican leaders is whether they will even try to do so.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Cars Ruled Pebble Beach Auctions? The Ones You Can\u2019t Afford", "Date": "2016-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheels9 PhotosMONTEREY, Calif. \u2014 Even in the collectible car market, there are the 1 percenters and everyone else.In the rarefied reaches, global collectors here recently spent an intense quarter-hour in an auction tent on Fisherman\u2019s Wharf, bidding by phone or in person on a rare Jaguar D-type racecar, the 1956 winner of the 24 Hours of Le Mans.Starting at $10 million and eventually rising in $100,000 increments, the car was sold for $21.8 million to an anonymous bidder. The applause lasted nearly half a minute as the audience, containing more than a few Britons, realized it was a record price for a British-made car sold at auction.\u201cThe car gave an Oscar-worthy performance on the block,\u201d said Ian Kelleher, the West Coast managing director of the auction house, RM Sotheby\u2019s, that sold the car at one of the five auctions here that ran over four days, Aug. 18 to 21, at the collector-car world\u2019s biggest annual event, the Pebble Beach car week.But as an indicator of an overall softening in demand for less prestigious collectible vehicles \u2014 those in the comparatively modest $100,000 to $1 million range \u2014 consider the fate of a 1968 Maserati Ghibli coupe.Its white leather was dirty and creased, and the paint was far from perfect. In need of a thorough refreshing, the car sold for $132,000, well below its presale estimate of $160,000 to $200,000.\u201cIn today\u2019s market, cars that are ready to enjoy still inspire spirited bidding,\u201d said Tony Rackley a Los Angeles-based collector-dealer and a 16-year veteran of the Monterey auctions. \u201cCars with needs don\u2019t.\u201dThe shrug-worthy Maserati was but one of many signs at this year\u2019s auctions that passions are cooling in the lower tiers of the collectible-car world.While people with that sort of money to spend may not be emblematic of the larger economy, a softening of the collector-car market could reflect broader uncertainties around the world. Concerns about the United States election, Britain\u2019s \u201cBrexit,\u201d an assertive Russia and slack demand in the global economy have made some people think twice about sacrificing liquidity on a discretionary purchase like a classic car, Mr. Kelleher said.There is simply less exuberance in the car marketplace than three or four years ago, when the moneyed classes were bouncing back from the world financial crisis.As David Gooding, founder of the auction house Gooding & Company, put it, \u201cBuyers are both discriminating and rational at the moment.\u201dAt this year\u2019s Monterey auctions, according to preliminary data provided by Hagerty, a classic-car insurer, the so-called sell-through rate for cars initially priced above $100,000 was the lowest in Monterey since 2000, dropping to 57 percent this year from 72 percent in 2015.That means only slightly more than half the 1,273 cars up for auction here found buyers.The total dollar volume of sales of the five auction companies at the event \u2014 Bonhams, Gooding, Mecum Auctions, RM Sotheby\u2019s and Russo and Steele \u2014 were down, too, to around $340 million this year, from about $395 million in 2015. And last year\u2019s total was down from $403 million in 2014.The annual Monterey auctions are timed to coincide with the nearby Pebble Beach Concours d\u2019 El\u00e9gance, a car show that has been held on the 18th fairway of the golf course since 1950. It attracts some of the most beautiful, elegant and expensive automobiles on the planet, all vying for best of show. This year\u2019s honor went to a 1936 Lancia Astura Pinin Farina Cabriolet, the first best of show Pebble Beach win for Lancia and for the car\u2019s owner, Richard Mattei.Other related auto-phile events that have sprung up during Pebble Beach week include the ultraupscale Quail motor sports gathering. The Quail organizers held what was meant to be an annual Peninsula Classics Best of the Best Award, bringing together last year\u2019s winner of the Concours d\u2019El\u00e9gance and the winners of five other prestigious international concours. The jury, which included Jay Leno, Ralph Lauren and Henry Ford III, selected a 1937 Talbo-Lago T-150-C SS as the inaugural winner.But with the auction houses anticipating slightly less exuberant spending this year, both Gooding and RM/Sotheby\u2019s \u2014 whose average sales prices exceed $1 million \u2014 came to Monterey with as much fresh-to-market, unimpeachable inventory as they could muster.Led by the sale of a 1959 Ferrari 250 GT California Spider for $18.15 million, Gooding had its highest overall two-day result \u2014 about $130 million \u2014 since the company\u2019s Pebble Beach debut in 2004.RM had huge individual successes, too, not only with the Jaguar D-type but with the first Shelby Cobra, for $13.75 million, and a magnificent 1939 Alfa Romeo 8C 2900B Lungo Spider that went for $19.8 million.But those were exceptions.One car that was emblematic of a cooling market was the 1965 Porsche 911 coupe offered by Bonhams.Before 2013, in the run-up to the 50th anniversary of the 911, prices rose steadily for early models of the car. But more recently they have been falling. The one up for auction here was bid up to $175,000, which was arguably a fair price in the current market. But because that did not meet the reserve price set by the owner, the car went unsold.So did a 1971 Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona, in an odd shade of light yellow. A bid of just $520,000 against a presale estimate of $600,000 to $750,000 was not enough to pry the car loose. Maybe the market was unwilling to accept this most macho of Ferraris in a pastel shade. As with the wallflower 911, the car was loaded on a trailer and sent home.If the collectibles market is having a soft landing, experts say that is infinitely preferable to a crash. Had things continued as they did from 2011 through 2015, with some cars increasing in value by as much as 300 percent in just one year, collectors and auctioneers would have been fearing a bubble that might burst at any time, just as it did in 1991.As the auto writer Peter Bohr recalled that cataclysm in the February 1994 issue of Road & Track: \u201cAlas, the frenzy reached dizzying heights and then fizzled with the dawn of the nineties. And the ending was brutal for many.\u201dAs car market corrections go, the downturn this time is more like letting a bit of air out of the tires.slide showslide showAdvertisement"}

The Tigrayan ethnic group makes up about 6 percent of the population but dominates in politics, the military and commerce.Seyoum Teshome, a university lecturer in central Ethiopia, predicted that the Ethiopian government will indeed treat Mr. Lelisa like a hero, at least publicly. \u201cThey will not do anything silly against that guy,\u201d he said.\u201cThe whole world knows about him now,\u201d Mr. Teshome said. \u201cIf they arrest him, it will be a huge mistake and create a further disturbance.\u201dThe Ethiopian government is known to be quite adept at damage control, using urbane officials to deflect criticism. So far, it seems to have worked.Human rights groups have complained for years about repression and brutality inside Ethiopia, but the government continues to maintain friendly ties with the West, which sees Ethiopia as a stable ally in a region that has been plagued by violent extremism and chaos. President Obama, for example, visited Ethiopia in 2015.Mr. Teshome said, however, that Mr. Lilesa\u2019s act \u2014 crossing his arms at a moment when millions were watching him on TV \u2014 had been a blow to the carefully constructed image the government has tried to project.He said that many Ethiopians were impressed by Mr. Lelisa\u2019s courage, and that \u201ceverybody is talking about it\u201d in the town where Mr. Teshome lives, Woliso, and across social media.But Mr. Teshome said that on Monday, the state-controlled media was not broadcasting any images of Mr. Lelisa with his arms crossed. \u201cThis was what the government was afraid of,\u201d he said.Mr. Teshome said he expected that Mr. Lelisa would not return to Ethiopia, even if officials pledged he would be safe.\u201cWhether they treat him well or not doesn\u2019t make a difference; he was protesting what happens to his people, the killing of his people,\u201d Mr. Teshome said. \u201cWe are living in a dictatorial state, a totalitarian state.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated when Feyisa Lilesa made his second protest gesture.

Once they return home to recover, the disease spreads.Supported byTHE ALBINO MINE, Venezuela \u2014 The 12th time Reinaldo Balocha got malaria, he hardly rested at all. With the fever still rattling his body, he threw a pick ax over his shoulder and got back to work \u2014 smashing stones in an illegal gold mine.So, like tens of thousands of other people from across the country, Mr. Balocha came to these open, swampy mines scattered across the jungle, looking for a future. Here, waiters, office workers, taxi drivers, college graduates and even civil servants on vacation from their government jobs are out panning for black-market gold, all under the watchful eyes of an armed group that taxes them and threatens to tie them to posts if they disobey.But in Venezuela, the clock is running backward.It all starts with the mines. With the economy in tatters, at least 70,000 people from all walks of life have been streaming into this mining region over the past year, said Jorge Moreno, a leading mosquito expert in Venezuela. As they hunt for gold in watery pits, the perfect breeding ground for the mosquitoes that spread the disease, they are catching malaria by the tens of thousands.Then, with the disease in their blood, they return home to Venezuela\u2019s cities. But because of the economic collapse, there is often no medicine and little fumigation to prevent mosquitoes there from biting them and passing malaria to others, sickening tens of thousands more people and leaving entire towns desperate for help.The economic breakdown has \u201ctriggered a great migration in Venezuela, and right behind it is the spread of malaria,\u201d said Dr. Moreno, a researcher at a state-run laboratory in the mining region. \u201cWith this breakdown comes a disease that is cooked in the same pot.\u201dOnce out of the mines, malaria spreads quickly. Five hours away in Ciudad Guayana, a rusting former industrial boomtown where many are now jobless and have taken to wildcatting in the mines, a crowd of 300 people packed the waiting room of a clinic in May. All had symptoms of the disease: fevers, icy chills and uncontrollable tremors.There were no lights because the government had cut power to save electricity. There were no medicines because the Health Ministry had not delivered any. Health workers administered blood tests with their bare hands because they were out of gloves.Maribel Supero clutched her 23-year-old son as he trembled, unable to speak. Jos\u00e9 Castro held his 18-month-old daughter as she screamed. Griselda Bello, who works at the clinic, waved her hands helplessly and told yet another patient to hold on a bit longer.The pills had run out. There was nothing she could do.\u201cCome back tomorrow at 10 a.m.,\u201d she said.\u201cMy God,\u201d the patient said. \u201cSomeone might die by then.\u201d\u201cIndeed, they might,\u201d she said.In the nearby town of Pozo Verde, residents said malaria had swept in after miners began returning home sick, the government fumigators having vanished two years ago. Now, the public high school has become an incubating ground of its own: A quarter of its 400 students have contracted malaria since November.\u201cYou would think we would do something \u2014 a cordon, a quarantine,\u201d said Arebalo Enr\u00edquez, the principal of the school, who contracted malaria, as did his wife, mother and seven other members of his family.Officially, the spread of malaria in Venezuela has become a state secret. The government has not published epidemiological reports on the disease in the past year, and it says there is no crisis.But the most recent internal figures, obtained by The New York Times from Venezuelan doctors involved in compiling it, confirms a surge is underway.In the first six months of the year, malaria cases rose 72 percent, to a total of 125,000, according to the figures. The disease cut a wide path through the country, with cases present in more than half of its 23 states. And among the malaria strains present here is Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite that causes the most fatal form of the disease.\u201cIt is a situation of national shame,\u201d said Dr. Jos\u00e9 Oletta, a former Venezuelan health minister who lives in the capital, Caracas, where malaria cases are now appearing, too. \u201cI was seeing this kind of thing when I was a medical student a half-century ago. It hurts me. The disease had disappeared.\u201dIn El Dique, a rural town where malaria was largely unknown until two years ago, Juana Garc\u00eda, 66, sat outside her home, newly widowed since her husband fell ill with the disease and died. She hardly spoke or moved from her chair.\u201cShe will keep fighting,\u201d said her daughter Ana Mar\u00eda Padr\u00f3n.Inside Ms. Padr\u00f3n\u2019s adobe home, her two sons were fighting malaria, too. Almost like clockwork, their fevers began in the morning: at 8 a.m. for Omar, who is 8; at 11 for Aristides, who is 7. The family has found no medicine. The boys have only painkillers.\u201cWe pray,\u201d their mother said.The illegal mines spill out over dozens of miles, leaving a pockmarked stretch of earth where the jungle gives way to countless craters and scars.Some are no more than tiny pools where two men sift the mud with pans, like a scene from the California goldfields more than a century ago. Others drain wide marshes with tangled networks of tubes and pumps. In another spot, hundreds of wildcatters had dug out a gaping maw of red and white soil. It sinks 15 stories deep and runs the length of a football field. They call it Cuatro Muertos, or Four Dead Men.It was not supposed to be this way. The gold reserves were once controlled by a Canadian company before President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez expropriated them and pledged to use their profits to fund his Socialist-style revolution.But the expropriation followed the pattern of mismanagement and neglect that many others did during the Ch\u00e1vez era. The state eventually abandoned the territory around the mine, and the potentially lucrative profits. Wildcatters have moved in, and so have the armed groups that now call themselves the law here.But at least there is food.As the country convulses from food shortages and riots, as hungry mobs ransack grocery stores, restaurants and bakeries, the mining town of Las Claritas, only a short drive from the mines, lives in a state of relative plenty.Restaurants offer full menus. Street markets are packed with fruit. Pickups drive by loaded with pumpkins. In a country where soap is in short supply, a dozen brands are on sale in a Chinese-owned grocery store, where seven models of flat-screen televisions are also available. Miners dish out fat wads of their gold earnings in cash, which run through a bill-counting machine.The promise of a different Venezuela \u2014 one where there is ample food and work that pays enough \u2014 led Yudani Gonz\u00e1lez to abandon a program to become a preschool teacher in Ciudad Bol\u00edvar, the provincial capital, where unemployment is rampant. Instead, she headed to a ramshackle jungle camp, where she cooks for miners with one hand and cares for her two young children with the other.\u201cHere, you can get ahead,\u201d Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez said, washing her 1-year-old daughter in a plastic bucket on the counter as she cooked.Danneris Flores, a government employee moonlighting as a mining camp cook, sat nearby. She is an administrative assistant in a state-run health clinic, but Venezuela\u2019s currency has tumbled so far that her salary amounts to only about $1 a day at the current street value.So she asked for a vacation \u2014 and used it to work for a couple of weeks at the mines.Her brother-in-law, who works for the state oil company, Pdvsa, does the same thing. In a short stint at the mines, Ms. Flores said she could earn twice her monthly wages. She counted the days until she would be home to see her three children, whom she had left after \u201cclosing my eyes and making my heart small.\u201d\u201cI never imagined that I would work in a mine,\u201d she said to Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez as they served a meal. \u201cBefore, people thought of going to school.\u201dA miner walked in to greet the women and said he had recently watched someone collapse and die of malaria on her way to a market. Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez said she had come down with it four times herself. Her 4-year-old, she said, has had it three times.\u201cThey charge you two grams of gold for medicine,\u201d she said. \u201cYou pay what they ask.\u201dNot everyone can find medication, even with gold earnings.Jos\u00e9 Yoel Castillo stumbled to the doorstep of the malaria clinic in Las Claritas, carried on the shoulders of two relatives as he convulsed and was unable to speak.He had been making a living in the town of Caicara del Orinoco, driving passengers on the back of a motorcycle. But an armed gang took the vehicle, and Mr. Castillo could not afford a new one.So he came to the mines. He quickly found work and money \u2014 even malaria medication the first time he became ill. But when the symptoms came a second time, he could not find treatment anywhere.\u201cSome people can just keep working through it,\u201d said his brother-in-law, Alejandro L\u00f3pez. \u201cBut others can\u2019t.\u201dEven with money in their pockets, the miners know the dangers of going back home.Josu\u00e9 Guevara, 20, gave up last November on his university studies in industrial engineering in a city about 10 hours away. He once pictured himself as a manager at the state-owned aluminum company, Alcasa. But his family members who worked there could barely afford food, he said.\u201cNow I have other goals,\u201d he said, standing at the edge of the Cuatro Muertos mines, where he lives and works today.Using gasoline and other chemicals to extract the gold, Mr. Guevara earned 500,000 bol\u00edvars \u2014 around $500 at black-market exchange rates, about 33 times the country\u2019s minimum wage \u2014 during a lucky two-week stretch. But when he got malaria this spring, he did what many miners do: He returned to his hometown to recover, bringing the disease with him.\u201cEverything has its risks,\u201d he said.On the other side of the vast pit, Pedro P\u00e9rez, 38, sat in a structure made of tree poles and tarp where he sleeps with 10 other miners. He tested positive for malaria twice in March. The third time he fell ill, he did not bother to get tested.\u201cI was lying here and I felt the same symptoms,\u201d he said.He, too, went back home \u2014 to the provincial capital, Ciudad Bol\u00edvar, where his mother eventually caught malaria, as well.\u201cIt\u2019s coming from us,\u201d Mr. P\u00e9rez said.Mr. P\u00e9rez remembered his life before he came to the mines last fall: He was a supervisor at a state-owned metal refinery, he said.He owned a four-bedroom, two-bathroom house and a 2005 Ford Focus. He and his wife, a lawyer, once jetted off on last-minute getaways to Isla Margarita, a tropical island off the north coast of Venezuela.Yet even before he lost his job last year and was unable to find another, Venezuela\u2019s plummeting currency had whittled his salary down to about $26 a month. He eventually left home for the mine.\u201cI am still not used to washing myself every day in a river of dirty water,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought I had a good life.\u201dA few weeks ago, his wife came to Las Claritas to buy the food and soap she could not find in Ciudad Bol\u00edvar. The couple spent three nights together in a miner\u2019s hostel. After she left, Mr. P\u00e9rez felt the strains on their marriage.\u201c\u2018I know it\u2019s hard for you,\u2019 I tell her, \u2018but we have to accept this new reality,\u2019\u201d he said.Back in Las Claritas, at a table in a dark brothel that smelled of alcohol, sat Ang\u00e9lica, a young woman with long black hair whose parents do not know she has turned to prostitution to make her living.She left the eastern city of Matur\u00edn three months ago when riots erupted because food had gone scarce.\u201cBefore, you waited in line for hours, but you got something,\u201d said Ang\u00e9lica, who did not give her last name, ashamed of her work. \u201cBut now there is nothing there.\u201dToday she earns the equivalent of $40 when a miner wants to spend the night with her. More often, the money comes in increments of $8, when a customer wants to have sex and leave a short time later.At times, she said, it may be a stranger who is trembling with fever, unable to perform because of malaria. Other times, it is the owner of one of the Chinese grocery stores. The men come from all corners of the country.\u201cThe most difficult part of this life is being with someone who you do not love,\u201d she said.Venezuela rose only after malaria declined.It was the 1920s and another resource had set off a bonanza \u2014 the black gold of oil, discovered in massive supply.But a vast malaria hot zone, then two-thirds of Venezuela, stood between the country and its riches. The deadly scenes were later immortalized in \u201cDead Homes,\u201d a 1955 Venezuelan novel about the rural epidemics of malaria and the waves of migration to the country\u2019s oil fields.Freeing the country of malaria became pivotal to Venezuela\u2019s development, said Dr. Oletta, the former health minister.\u201cOnly once malaria was gone, roads could come, industry,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was a sick country, and when it got well, things changed.\u201dThat transformative effort was led by Dr. Arnoldo Gabald\u00f3n, the former health minister who began one of the world\u2019s first large-scale efforts to eradicate malaria and who became a national hero during his age.Teams across the Venezuelan countryside built irrigation ditches to drain pools of standing water, distributed quinine and constructed cinder block homes in rural areas so that mosquitoes had fewer places to breed. Dr. Gabald\u00f3n founded a research center in the city of Maracay, outside of Caracas and itself a malaria zone at the time, to broaden the mission and train officials from Latin America and Africa.But it was his use of insecticides \u2014 initially DDT, then other substances \u2014 that began to turn the tide. The walls of nearly every rural home in the country were sprayed, a technique that killed mosquitoes when they landed to rest. Fumigators would leave an envelope showing the date they would return.By 1949, malaria deaths had fallen drastically: to nine per 100,000 people from 300.By the time Mr. Ch\u00e1vez assumed the presidency 50 years later and began to carry out his Socialist-inspired vision for Venezuela, the regimented system of Dr. Gabald\u00f3n had long faded, though malaria still appeared to be confined to a few rural areas. But the restructuring of the economy under Mr. Ch\u00e1vez and his followers, including a growing dependence on oil revenue and a system of currency controls restricting American dollars, would eventually change that.In 2014 and 2015, as oil prices collapsed and the government scrambled for money to pay for goods, services and imports, there were long shortages of chloroquine and primaquine, two drugs used for Plasmodium vivax, the most prevalent malaria parasite in the Americas.By 2016, doctors said there were shortages of nearly all anti-malaria drugs, most notably a drug cocktail for the deadly falciparum strain that costs just several dollars for a full round of treatment. Though debilitating and even fatal, malaria is easily treatable with the proper medication.Dr. Leopoldo Villegas, an international malaria expert in Bangkok, said the government also relied on outdated methods like outdoor fogging with insecticides, which had unproven effects on adult mosquitoes that transmit malaria. And because it was not publishing epidemiological reports of new malaria cases or deaths, it was unclear how much medicine was needed each year.\u201cThis is an emergency, this is an outbreak, and it\u2019s not being dealt with by the government this way,\u201d Dr. Villegas said, adding that the Venezuelan government had repeatedly denied the extent of malaria\u2019s resurgence to international organizations that could help prevent its spread.Gustavo Bretas, a Brazilian malaria expert, said that Venezuela once trained people throughout the region in malaria prevention. But Venezuela\u2019s inability to contain its own outbreak means that it now plays the opposite role: It poses a threat to the countries around it, particularly Brazil, where there are also illegal gold mines.\u201cIt\u2019s starting to spill over into neighboring countries,\u201d he said, adding that the lack of government statistics made the extent of the problem hard to assess.Venezuela\u2019s Health Ministry did not respond to requests for an interview, including a letter delivered to its offices.Oscar Noya now works in Dr. Gabald\u00f3n\u2019s old laboratory in Caracas under a picture of his mentor in a suit and bow tie. On a recent day, malaria patients once again sat on the steps, most having arrived from the mines. Fifteen had come on a recent morning; 12 of them tested positive for the disease.Dr. Noya tries to make do without many vital drugs, like artesunate, listed by the W.H.O. as an essential medicine for the treatment of severe cases of falciparum malaria. He has only three vials of it left. He needs six to treat a single patient with a serious case.One recent night, a gang entered one of his malaria laboratories and stole the computers, one of about 20 attacks this year against the Tropical Medical Institute where he works, Dr. Noya said. He wonders if the groups are aligned with the government.\u201cWe believe this is no more than intimidation because we\u2019re not quiet and we won\u2019t be quiet,\u201d he said, referring to public advocacy about malaria and the spread of other diseases.Dr. Noya put away his vials of artesunate as more patients gathered outside. He looked up with an air of desperation. \u201cDr. Gabald\u00f3n would have died of a heart attack if he\u2019d seen what is happening,\u201d he said.Despite the constant churn of workers from across Venezuela, there is a clear order to the mines.It is enforced by an armed group known as the Union.One of the Union\u2019s bosses came to the mines years ago to work as a dentist. He still does. But the squads of patrolmen on motorbikes who dominate this place are the real source of his wealth and power. He sports gold chains, two gold teeth \u2014 and brass knuckles made of gold.After the government abandoned them, the mines soon grew again, this time at an unruly pace as wildcatters plowed into the forest, creating pools of stagnant water and a population of easy prey for the mosquitoes that breed in them, paving the way for the explosion of malaria.Sitting on his patio, the boss, who declined to be named because he could be arrested by the government, took pride in what he said was the Union\u2019s ability to fill in for the vacuum left by the state. Yes, he acknowledged, the punishments the group meted out could be gruesome, like shooting off a man\u2019s hand when he stole, or tying others to posts at the entrance of town with a sign detailing the offense committed.But he argued that the discipline kept crime in the camps low and allowed miners to go about their business in peace \u2014 another aspect of life that has steadily eroded in Venezuela\u2019s dangerous cities.\u201cTo get justice from the police is a joke,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to get your own justice.\u201dEduardo Medina agreed. A former pharmacist, he said he had left the drugstore where he worked in the state of Zulia a year ago to start mining because he saw the economic crisis spread and law and order slip away.\u201cAt any time, you might go out and someone would put a pistol in your face for your phone, or knife your mother,\u201d Mr. Medina said in his tent. \u201cCrime is under control here. They charge us, but they solve the problems, too.\u201dBut the appearance of calm is deceiving. Storms rage in other places where rivals vie for control of the mines. In March, at least 17 miners were killed in what the authorities believed was one such dispute.Mr. Medina, on a break, looked down into the pit where his fellow miners labored.\u201cAt any moment, you can be killed in Zulia,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you can be killed here, too.\u201dFor all the challenges of keeping order, the boss said, malaria was even harder.\u201cOn malaria, we are screwed,\u201d he said.The task of monitoring the disease seems to have been delegated to people like a state health employee named Miguel Mart\u00ednez, who sat at a lonely post a short walk from a brothel near the mines, examining blood samples from miners. Under his microscope, a dye had stained the malaria parasite a dark purple. The log beside him showed that half of the patients who had visited him that day had tested positive for malaria.Like many health workers in this country, Mr. Mart\u00ednez was exasperated.\u201cJust as there are no rice and beans in this country, there are no medicines,\u201d he said.Evening approached at the mine, the time when the Anopheles mosquito begins to feed. Dusk settled over a clapboard Pentecostal church, where parishioners speak in tongues, and past a red-and-blue circus tent promising alcohol and a strip tease.Under a tarp, five men hammered away at a vein of quartz, which they would grind down and sift for gold. Others waded up to their shoulders in pools laden with heavy metals like mercury, angling tubes to pump the mud. Tropical birds flew in the distance.\u201cIs the malaria really coming from the miners?\u201d asked An\u00edbal Flores, 28, a miner who sleeps in a hammock between two poles beside the mine. \u201cBut where else can we go to make money? The city? There is no food there.\u201dLately, many Venezuelans have taken matters into their own hands.Five hours away in the newly infected town of El Dique, residents were collecting 100 bol\u00edvars from each household to hire a fumigator to come spray their homes.In the mine, where malaria tests are sometimes unavailable, miners said they had developed an exam of their own: Drink two bottles of beer. If a sharp pain is felt afterward in the liver, where the parasites reside, then the patient has malaria, the test goes. Health officials said the measure was futile.Still, Mr. Balocha, the former computer technician who works in the Albino Mine, lives by it. Miners call it an \u201cartisanal test.\u201dHe was sick once again, waiting for medicine at a chain-link fence on the edge of a clinic. He recalled the words of his uncle, who phoned him a year ago when Mr. Balocha found his salary as a computer technician to be worthless in the city of Valencia.\u201cThere is money here,\u201d said the uncle, who was mining then. \u201cYou have to know how to find it.\u201dMr. Balocha started as a \u201cpalero,\u201d a stone breaker, getting the smallest cut of the take. But it was still more than what his salary bought in the city after inflation had whittled it away, he said.He recalled the first time he got malaria, too, the \u201cchills like you were lying down between two blocks of ice.\u201d\u201cThe first time you get malaria is the ugliest,\u201d Mr. Balocha said. \u201cYou can\u2019t control the tremors. You feel like you will die. You feel like you are a zombie.\u201dBut he would become a millionaire here, he joked, and one day he would head to Europe \u2014 with a Latin American woman, he added \u2014 far from the mines, the malaria and the Union.He sighed, looking up at the sky.\u201cIn the mine, happiness is only temporary,\u201d he said.Patricia Torres and Clavel Rangel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Debt. Terror. Politics. To Seattle Millennials, the Future Looks Scary.", "Date": "2016-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Part of Jillian Boshart\u2019s life plays out in tidy, ordered lines of JavaScript computer code, and part in a flamboyant whirl of corsets and crinoline. She\u2019s a tech student by day, an enthusiastic burlesque artist and producer by night. \u201cCode-mode\u201d and \u201cshow-mode,\u201d she calls those different guises.\u201cMy mother got stage fright for me,\u201d she said on a recent night while talking about her childhood performances and dreams. She looked like a 1940s starlet in a tight black sequined dress, a red rose pinned into her red hair. \u201cI like to be prepared,\u201d she said. \u201cI like to be in control.\u201dAt age 31, she seems to be. This year she won a coveted spot here at a nonprofit tech school for women, whose recent graduates have found jobs with starting salaries averaging more than $90,000 a year. Seattle, where she came after college in Utah to study musical theater, is booming with culture and youthful energy.But again and again, life has taught Ms. Boshart, and others in her generation, that control can be elusive. In the dot-com crash of the early 2000s, her family lost the college savings they had been putting aside for her. Her father, a nurse, was laid off after 35 years on the job. Her sister and brother-in-law lost their house during the Great Recession. And very little in the world around Ms. Boshart has led her to feel a sense of comfort and ease: not the soaring costs of living in Seattle, not the whirlwind roar of reinvention in the tech world, certainly not the barbed clamor of national politics.Even for someone who seems to have drawn one of her generation\u2019s winning hands, it feels like a daunting time to be coming of age in America.\u201cI don\u2019t just expect things to unfold, or think, \u2018Well, now I\u2019ve got it made,\u2019 because there\u2019s always a turn just ahead of you and you don\u2019t know what\u2019s around that corner,\u201d she said.On the 10th floor of a downtown office building here on a rainy morning in June, a software development instructor stood in a darkened classroom, the images and words from a screen projection branding his white shirt with the fractured punctuation-mark language of computer code.The students at Ada \u2014 Adies, as they affectionately call one other \u2014 are in many ways representative of Seattle\u2019s churning, anxious arc of growth and change. The 61 women who have graduated since the school\u2019s founding in 2013 have been drawn here from across the nation and several other countries. Tuition is free for applicants who pass the rigorous admissions process, with costs underwritten by Seattle tech giants like Amazon.Of the 13 most populous counties in the nation, King County in the Seattle metro area is second only to Brooklyn in the highest percentage of residents age 25 to 34, part of the biggest demographic wave since the baby boom, according to census data. And Seattle is luring those millennials from all over, with King ranking second among big counties in the percentage of people who moved here within the past year from another state.But even in a place of alluring opportunity, the Adies, like Ms. Boshart, mirror their generation\u2019s anxieties.Hailey Willis, for example, was accepted to Ada and arrived here last year from Chicago with six months of savings to her name. In Seattle, markedly more expensive, the money was gone in 90 days. Asked about her financial future, Ms. Willis, 31, said she saw no chance that anything like Social Security would be there for her or anyone her age.Elsa Moluf, 26, an Ada graduate, said the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, still resonated when she thought about personal safety \u2014 a feeling compounded recently by a shooting on a Seattle street in broad daylight only a few feet from her. \u201cIn the era of terrorism, I think about stuff like, \u2018If I go to this crowded festival, what are the chances,\u2019 \u201d she said.Baby boomers, to whom millennials are often compared \u2014 if only by the force of their numbers \u2014 also reached adulthood amid tumult and angst, during the Vietnam War and the struggle for civil rights. But people now in their 20s and 30s say that the 1960s were different, that there seemed to be a clearer goal then \u2014 to end racial segregation, poverty or the war. The economy seemed better and the nation\u2019s future more assured.Now, from niche anxieties like genetically modified crops to defining ones like climate change, questions feel open-ended and unprecedented: Is the food we eat still food? How do you get your head around a threat to the entire planet?Contradictions and paradoxes, millennials say, come with the territory. Ms. Boshart, for example, would love to own a house someday. But at the same time, debt to her feels perilous. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be beholden to any bank, ever,\u201d she said with quiet vehemence. She counts the months until the tech job she hopes to get after Ada can help pay off the $22,000 student debt she has left.And then there are presidential politics, with one candidate, Donald J. Trump, who scares her to death and another, Hillary Clinton, whom she admires but is sometimes hesitant to praise too loudly in an area where most people she knew supported Senator Bernie Sanders.She sees politics through a feminist lens and believes that women\u2019s rights would be undermined by a Trump presidency and a Trump-selected Supreme Court. And even though recent polls and surveys show Sanders supporters largely rallying to Mrs. Clinton, it is not enough to create any sense of security, Ms. Boshart said, that an October surprise of hacked data or a hidden pool of misogyny and rage do not still lie in wait.\u201cThere are just so many things you can be anxious about \u2014 it\u2019s an anxious time,\u201d she said. \u201cMy biggest fear is that America hates women more than they hate Donald Trump.\u201dRiley Spicer, 26, said she cannot help buying food on sale and socking it away. She arrived in Seattle last year from rural Oregon to start classes at Ada, and she and her boyfriend, Jakob Lundy, 27, a fireman, have planted a garden and started a beehive to harvest honey.\u201cI had the radishes today in my salad at work,\u201d Ms. Spicer said on a recent evening, as she carefully exposed the leaves to reveal red-topped bulbs. \u201cWhen I go to the store and I get three bags of mushrooms, they\u2019re like, \u2018What are you doing?\u2019 I\u2019m stuffing mushrooms and freezing them \u2014 doesn\u2019t everyone do that?\u201dMs. Spicer, who studied philosophy and the history of science at St. John\u2019s College in Annapolis, Md., has had jobs as a barista, a taxi dispatcher and a deli worker. She has $72,000 of student debt and has never been paid an annual wage, she said, of more than $17,000. Based on the track record of Ada graduates, she could soon be making five times as much.So on one level, she and Mr. Lundy \u2014 young, in love and employed or soon to be \u2014 might look as if they are living the American dream.But neither one is buying it.\u201cI look out there and it just seems completely hopeless to me,\u201d she said as their 12-year-old mutt, Cordelia, wandered through their apartment. \u201cThe political system seems so overwhelmingly broken that I have no idea what to do about it.\u201dMr. Lundy rejects the two-party political system entirely and has voted mostly for third-party candidates, if only as a statement of opposition to the choice of a Republican or a Democrat. He is not sure what he will do this year.\u201cI don\u2019t want to support the false dichotomy,\u201d he said. He said he liked Mr. Sanders partly because a Sanders insurgency \u201cwould be best at reforming the party, or tearing it apart from the inside.\u201d He also applauded Mr. Trump\u2019s antics, which Mr. Lundy believes will shatter the Republican Party, too.Either way, he added, a shake-up is coming. \u201cThings are going to have to burn before they get better,\u201d he said.Technology is the sea that millennials swim in \u2014 a kind of second nature, especially to Adies. But many of them feel a deep ambivalence. Tech, they say, means military drones, loss of privacy and cyberbullying. Social media, the new town square, often feels more like a combat zone than a place to share ideas. Tech companies are driving up rent in places like Seattle, forcing out lower-income people, even while creating excellent jobs that Adies are likely to get.\u201cThe tech industry is a huge part of the problem,\u201d said Jessica Weeber, 31, who is studying at Ada alongside Ms. Boshart. \u201cAs people get paid more and work in tech jobs, rents and housing go up and gentrification happens,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to solve it.\u201dBut tech is also an unquestionably powerful tool.\u201cTech gives us the power to change \u2014 that\u2019s why I\u2019m here,\u201d said Mindy Carson, 31, an Ada student and strong supporter of Mr. Sanders. She wants to start a nonprofit after graduation, using technology to work on social justice issues. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to take what they\u2019re saying on TV for face value, we don\u2019t have to take limited information for face value, because we see the truth, we are connected,\u201d she added.Ms. Boshart used technology in a recent burlesque performance, including a recorded voice-over appearance by the astronomer Carl Sagan, to make a point about humanity\u2019s intertwined role with science.She walked on stage wearing a glamorous evening gown, opera gloves, and a corset underneath with 160 LED lights and a tiny computer to run them. Mr. Sagan\u2019s voice came on, talking about the cosmos. As her clothing came off, she said, \u201cI became more and more human. And that was kind of the point: We are artifice to the world, what we present, but as we get deeper and deeper into the human element we are atoms and star dust.\u201dMs. Boshart gravitated to burlesque, she said, partly to make such statements. But after her mother died last summer, things became more profound and personal. The women of the Seattle Burlesque Society showed up at the apartment she shares with her fianc\u00e9. They brought food. They cleaned. They carved out a quiet corner for grieving and meditation.They became, in their embrace, her sisters. Like many people in her generation, Ms. Boshart does not expect to find those connections in political parties. She no longer goes to church. The workplace doesn\u2019t seem to offer much hope either.\u201cMy dad was laid off after 35 years, and that was supposed to be his community, right? That was supposed to be the group of people that understood,\u201d she said before a recent Monday night performance that she was producing at a brewpub north of downtown. \u201cHe worked for years and years for you and he\u2019s just out? It was appalling to me.\u2019\u2019What should be tossed out, or clung to, is the question of the moment, she said. And for her, a big part of her answer lies in the proud and quirky universe of burlesque, her anchor of belonging in a world that can feel fragmented and frayed.As she got up from the table for a final chat with the cast, music pounded out as performers \u2014 various ages and body types in heavy eye shadow and feathered boas \u2014 got ready to go on. They hugged, and she cautioned them about a low table with sharp corners that would be hard to see in the dark. One small peril avoided, it was time for show-mode.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Rage Against Trade", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialHostility to trade \u2014 even misdirected rage \u2014 should not be taken lightly. While trade is not the cause of all or even much of the wage stagnation or increased income inequality in the past several decades, there are real problems with trade agreements, as Hillary Clinton and her former rival Senator Bernie Sanders have pointed out.Trade generally benefits the economy, though there are winners and losers. Consumers benefit from cheaper clothes, electronics and other goods, while companies like Apple can sell more of their products overseas. But trade has hurt some factories and workers in the United States because they have not been able to compete with foreign businesses that enjoy lower-cost labor as well as subsidies and other benefits from their governments.Mrs. Clinton has not offered details of what that would look like, but her approach would mean more assistance for workers affected by trade than Congress has been willing to offer, as well as negotiating provisions that would require other countries to improve their labor and environmental standards. She also wants other countries to agree not to depress the value of their currencies in an effort to boost their exports and says her administration would crack down on nations that engaged in such manipulation. It won\u2019t be easy to get other world leaders to go along. And American businesses with big overseas operations might also resist her proposed changes.Trade isn\u2019t the main force destroying good jobs, but at the moment, it serves as an easy target for an electorate anxious about the economy and looking for answers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stephen Bannon, a Rookie Campaign Chief Who \u2018Loves the Fight\u2019", "Date": "2016-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the American financial system collapsed in the fall of 2008, Stephen K. Bannon began to fantasize about destroying something else: the elite economic and political establishment that he believed had created the crisis.Mr. Bannon, who was named Donald J. Trump\u2019s campaign chief on Wednesday, was at the time a highly improbable revolutionary, a wealthy former Goldman Sachs banker and a budding filmmaker. But his blue-collar Southern roots tugged at him: panicked by the swooning market, his father, a telephone company lineman with no college degree, had sold much of the stock in his retirement account.\u201cSteve felt it was outrageous,\u201d said Scot Vorse, his former business partner and a longtime friend.It was the start of a remarkable reinvention that turned a polished corporate dealmaker who once devised $10 billion mergers on Wall Street into a purveyor of scorched-earth right-wing media who dwells in the darker corners of American politics.With its provocative content, bare-knuckle style and populist message, Breitbart is, in many ways, a mirror of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign \u2014 which explains why the Republican nominee was so drawn to Mr. Bannon, Breitbart\u2019s chairman.\u201cSteve is a fighter. He loves the fight. He loves the scrum,\u201d said Andrew Marcus, who met Mr. Bannon, a Navy veteran, while making a documentary about Breitbart\u2019s founding editor, Andrew Breitbart, who died in 2012.Mr. Bannon, 62, who grew up in a Democratic family in Virginia that fled the party in favor of Richard Nixon\u2019s law-and-order Republicanism, has quietly advised Mr. Trump throughout his campaign, according to friends and colleagues. But as Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy has started to sputter and flail, Mr. Bannon\u2019s role has intensified, so much so that Mr. Trump asked to meet with him over the weekend and offered him the position of chief executive.That vaunted post, which makes Mr. Bannon the single most influential figure in the Trump campaign, is a leap of faith by a candidate who has long eschewed political professionals: Mr. Bannon has never before worked on a national campaign, let alone overseen one. But his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is thick with the kind of experience Mr. Trump covets: a deep understanding of how the news media works and how public perceptions are molded.Over the past decade, Mr. Bannon has built a small but potent media empire designed to directly challenge the country\u2019s cultural and political elite, whom he sees as incorrigibly detached from working-class America and responsible for dismantling its backbone \u2014 an industrial economy that employed its families and the secure borders that protected them.He made movies that lionized Sarah Palin and vilified the Occupy Wall Street movement as fraudulent rebels backed by well-off liberals.A trailer for that film, called \u201cOccupy Unmasked,\u201d is a fevered compilation of rioting, profanity, a burning American flag and a man appearing to brush his bare behind against a police car.\u201cWe are finally telling you the true story of the radicals behind the Occupy movement,\u201d Mr. Breitbart, the film\u2019s star, says grimly into the camera.Mr. Bannon, who declined to be interviewed for this article, has made little secret of his desire to frighten Americans out of complacency, fusing relentless provocation and a hodgepodge of conservative ideas to make the case for rebellion against the political order.\u201cFear is a good thing,\u201d he said in a 2010 interview. \u201cFear is going to lead you to take action.\u201dHis timing was serendipitous: Mr. Bannon\u2019s ventures in right-wing film and news were perfectly timed to capture the emerging fury of the Tea Party movement, which was still smarting from the federal bailout of Wall Street banks like his former employer, Goldman Sachs, and the growing sense that the nation\u2019s top tier had sold out the working and middle classes.By 2014, Mr. Bannon had jumped from the political sidelines into the arena. When a little-known Republican candidate named David Brat challenged Eric Cantor, the House majority leader known for his close ties to Wall Street, Breitbart News put its thumb on the scale, publishing dozens of positive articles about the underdog\u2019s bid. Mr. Bannon was childhood friends with a top adviser to Mr. Brat, whose victory stunned Republican elders. It was a foretaste of the white-hot movement Mr. Trump would soon lead.\u201cHe is somebody who puts his activism on par with his intellectual work,\u201d said David Bossie, president of the conservative group Citizens United, who has collaborated on film projects with Mr. Bannon.\u201cA lot of intellectuals sit back and write columns and let other people do the work,\u201d Mr. Bossie said. \u201cSteve is a believer in doing both.\u201dThe credential that has earned Mr. Bannon a spot in the Trump campaign \u2014 his stewardship of Breitbart News \u2014 was something of an accident. The death of Mr. Breitbart, at age 43 of heart failure, was a shock to his reporters and fans.Mr. Bannon threw himself into the day-to-day management of the site, opening branches in Los Angeles and London and leading twice-daily conference calls during which he issued directives on what stories to pursue.His business acumen has paid off: Breitbart received 18.3 million unique visitors in July, according to data from comScore, up about 40 percent from the year prior. The site has outpaced conservative rivals like The Daily Caller, and Breitbart executives say that monthly traffic has increased by 16 times since the year Mr. Bannon took over.But some inside Breitbart chafed at Mr. Bannon\u2019s outspoken style of management, complaining that he upbraided staff members and seemed to embrace outright advocacy over journalistic principles.In March, several top reporters and executives resigned, saying that Mr. Bannon\u2019s insistence on articles favorable to Mr. Trump had compromised Mr. Breitbart\u2019s ethos that nothing was sacred.\u201cHe is someone who is prone to profanity-laced tirades at all hours of the night,\u201d said Kurt Bardella, a former spokesman for Breitbart, who quit after complaining that the site had transformed into \u201cTrump\u2019s de facto \u2018super PAC.\u2019\u201dBen Shapiro, a former editor at Breitbart, said Mr. Bannon\u2019s language could be startling. \u201cThere are very few people who have dealt with Steve Bannon who have not been cursed at,\u201d he said.Tensions spiked after Michelle Fields, a Breitbart reporter, accused Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, of shoving her at a rally. (Battery charges against Mr. Lewandowski were later dropped.) To the surprise of many on staff, Breitbart published an article that questioned portions of Ms. Fields\u2019s account, a rare case of a publication publicly challenging its own reporter. She later quit.Allies of Mr. Bannon say that he is simply a hard-charging manager with high expectations \u2014 a description echoed on Wednesday by Breitbart\u2019s chief executive, Larry Solov, who in a memo to the staff described Mr. Bannon as \u201ca huge piece of manpower.\u201dMr. Marcus, the documentary filmmaker, said that it frequently fell to Mr. Bannon to rein in the excessive instincts of Breitbart News and its staff in meetings. \u201cHe was a voice of reason,\u201d Mr. Marcus said of the time he spent inside the company, following Mr. Breitbart around. \u201cSteve was the one saying, hey, maybe you want to dial that back a bit.\u201dLike Mr. Trump, who remains closely involved with his real estate business despite his candidacy, Mr. Bannon is not walking away from his pastimes.The film may echo the bleaker themes of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. \u201cWe discuss how empires rise and fall, and how they lose God in their societies,\u201d said Mr. Bossie, of Citizens United, who is a producer.Asked if Mr. Bannon could succeed as a campaign manager, typically the ultimate insider role, Mr. Bossie said that Mr. Bannon\u2019s outsider status would be \u201ca plus, not a minus.\u201d\u201cThis,\u201d he added, \u201cis the year of the outsider.\u201dMatt Flegenheimer, Jeremy W. Peters and Kitty Bennett contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Broadband Law Could Force Rural Residents Off Information Superhighway", "Date": "2016-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe potatoes were tagged with online bar codes to detail the plots where they grew, their types of seed, and dates and times picked. On a conveyor belt, 50 flashing cameras captured and sent images of the spuds to an online program that sorted the Carolina Golds by size and quality and kicked them into boxes.The Vick family built the plant only after the nearby city of Wilson agreed early last year to bring its municipal broadband service to the 7,000-acre farm. Since the plant opened in October, the farm\u2019s production and sales to Europe have jumped.But now, after a legal battle between state and federal officials over broadband, the farm and hundreds of other customers in the eastern region of the state may get unplugged.\u201cWe\u2019re very worried because there is no way we could run this equipment on the internet service we used to have, and we can\u2019t imagine the loss we\u2019ll have to the business,\u201d said Charlotte Vick, head of sales for the farm.In siding with the states, the court hobbled the boldest effort by federal officials to support municipal broadband networks. While the court agreed that municipal networks were valuable, it disagreed with the F.C.C.\u2019s legal arguments to pre-empt state laws.Now, cities like Wilson fear they have little protection from laws like those in about 20 states that curb municipal broadband efforts and favor traditional cable and telecom firms. City officials say cable and telecom companies that have lobbied for state restrictions will be encouraged to fight for even more draconian laws, potentially squashing competition that could lead to lower prices and better speeds to access the web.In 2011, companies like Time Warner Cable, represented by the cable lobbying association, asked the North Carolina legislature to adopt a law to limit Wilson\u2019s ability to serve customers outside Wilson County, even though the city serves electricity customers in four additional counties.Grant Goings, Wilson\u2019s city manager, said the court decision made it unclear \u201chow we can bridge the digital divide and create economies of the future when there are corporate interests standing in the way.\u201dBut some lawmakers and free-market-oriented think tanks say public broadband projects should be carefully scrutinized by local regulators because they are costly and, if unsuccessful, can be a financial burden on taxpayers. In addition, the F.C.C. cannot intervene in state laws, they said.The court decision \u201caffirms the fact that unelected bureaucrats at the F.C.C. completely overstepped their authority by attempting to deny states like North Carolina from setting their own laws to protect hardworking taxpayers and maintain the fairness of the free market,\u201d Thom Tillis, a Republican United States senator who pushed through the 2011 bill when he was North Carolina\u2019s House speaker, said in a statement.\u201cIf local governments choose to compete with private internet service providers, there needs to be a level playing field,\u201d said Rondi Furgason, CenturyLink\u2019s vice president for operations in North Carolina.The F.C.C. does not plan to appeal the federal court\u2019s decision \u201cafter determining that doing so would not be the best use of commission resources,\u201d Mark Wigfield, a spokesman for the agency, said in a statement. That means municipalities that want to keep expanding their municipal broadband networks will have to fight to overturn state laws on their own.\u201cIt\u2019s bad news for projects looking to expand beyond their borders in hostile, anti-muni broadband states,\u201d said Robert Wack, president of the City Council in Westminster, Md., which began its own gigabit municipal network last year.For thousands of residents in communities near Wilson, about an hour from Raleigh, the court decision has created whiplash.In Pinetops, a short drive east of Wilson, many residents cheered the arrival of the Greenlight service last year. The former railroad stop, known for its picturesque pine trees, has long struggled to maintain its population of 1,300. Though many cars pass through the town, there is little reason to stop, since many storefronts are shuttered.Tina Gomez, a Pinetops resident, quickly saw Greenlight\u2019s benefits. She recently got a telework job with General Electric, which requires reliable high-speed internet service to run a customer service software program. Ms. Gomez, 37, also started online courses in medical billing and coding. Before subscribing to Greenlight, finding telework was a challenge because the existing home internet service was too slow, she said.Now the political squabble over broadband may hurt her livelihood. Mark Gomez, Ms. Gomez\u2019s husband, said they would move from Pinetops to Wilson when their broadband service was disconnected.\u201cWe can\u2019t stay if the basic services we need aren\u2019t here,\u201d Ms. Gomez said.At Vick Family Farms, Ms. Vick recalled what life was like before Wilson\u2019s municipal broadband service. Her previous service, supplied by CenturyLink, often stalled or stopped entirely. One week before Thanksgiving a few years ago, the farm was shut down for hours because of an internet failure, so workers had to pack boxes by hand.\u201cWe can\u2019t step back in time when everyone else is moving forward,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "North Dakota Oil Pipeline Battle: Who\u2019s Fighting and Why", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUpdated on Dec. 2, 2016Since the spring, thousands of people have gathered near Cannon Ball, N.D., to protest the construction of a an oil pipeline near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. The protests have occasionally resulted in violent clashes with law enforcement.During one tense confrontation last month, an explosion badly damaged one demonstrator\u2019s arm in what was among the most serious injuries of the clashes. This week, as heavy snow blanketed the plains, Gov. Jack Dalrymple of North Dakota ordered a mandatory evacuation of the area where the demonstrations are taking place, as more activists have vowed to join the protest.Here is a look at how the battle over the 1,170-mile pipeline has become an environmental and cultural flash point, stirring passions across social media and drawing thousands of protesters to camp out in rural North Dakota.Native Americans from scores of tribes have been gathering outside Cannon Ball \u2014 a town in south-central North Dakota, near the South Dakota border \u2014 to protest the Dakota Access pipeline. Starting with members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the protest has since grown to hundreds of people (estimates vary), most of them from Native American tribes across the country.In all, hundreds of people have been arrested since the protests began to attract widespread attention late this summer.The Dakota Access pipeline is a $3.7 billion project that would carry 470,000 barrels of oil a day from the oil fields of western North Dakota to Illinois, where it would be linked with other pipelines. Energy Transfer says the pipeline will pump millions of dollars into local economies and create 8,000 to 12,000 construction jobs \u2014 though far fewer permanent jobs to maintain and monitor the pipeline.Members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe see the pipeline as a major environmental and cultural threat. They say its route traverses ancestral lands \u2014 which are not part of the reservation \u2014 where their forebears hunted, fished and were buried. They say historical and cultural reviews of the land where the pipeline will be buried were inadequate. They also worry about catastrophic environmental damage if the pipeline were to break near where it crosses under the Missouri River.As of early December, the federal government was still not allowing the pipeline company to drill under the river to finish a critical section that would link the pipeline together. The Army Corps of Engineers said in mid-November that it wanted to hear more from the Standing Rock Sioux, citing the importance of the water to the tribe as well as a long, painful history of lands\u2019 being taken from the tribes.It is unclear whether the corps will ultimately allow or block the pipeline. It is also anyone\u2019s guess when it will make a final decision.Yes. State and federal agencies have approved the pipeline, and some farmers and ranchers have welcomed the thousands of dollars in payments that came with signing agreements to allow it to cross their land. But others oppose the pipeline.In Iowa, one of the four states that the pipeline would traverse, some farmers have gone to court to keep it off their land. They say that Iowa regulators were wrong to grant the pipeline company the power of eminent domain to force its way through their farms. Most landowners in the 346-mile path of the pipeline through Iowa, however, have signed easements allowing it to be built across their land.While a natural gas line to a newly built subdivision is not likely to generate national controversy, proposed major pipelines like the Keystone XL, the Dakota Access or the Sandpiper in northern Minnesota have generated huge opposition from environmental groups and people living in their paths.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Rumblings in the Auction World", "Date": "2016-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA year or two ago, in less unsettled times, it was relatively easy for the wealthy to enhance their social status, and maybe make some money, by collecting art. Auction houses courted sellers with lavish guarantees; buyers, even at the top of the market, could be reasonably certain that quality works by blue-chip names would hold their value.\u201cIt\u2019s all about supply,\u201d said Wendy Goldsmith, an art adviser in London. \u201cIf you don\u2019t offer $100 million guarantees, you\u2019re not going to get the best things.\u201d She added that demand had also become highly selective: \u201cThings either stagnate, or they sell like hot cakes. There isn\u2019t any middle ground any more.\u201dLower guarantees aside, other events over the past six months have made art a more thought-provoking investment.The Panama Papers and the investigations that followed threaten the very opacity that for some wealthy individuals has been one of the main attractions of the art market.The Financial Conduct Authority \u201crules are now clear about full disclosure of beneficial owners in all transactions,\u201d said Paul Ress, the chief executive of Right Capital, a company in London that provides loans secured against art. (He was referring to the independent British regulatory body.) \u201cWe will simply not do business with opaque company or trust structures without full disclosure of the underlying beneficiaries and controlling parties.\u201dOther issues have added to the general sense of uncertainty: the Brexit vote in Britain, the American presidential election, the terror attacks in Europe and a new law in Germany that will restrict the export outside the European Union of certain artworks.Adding to the pressure on the status quo, collectors\u2019 tastes appear to be shifting away from high-concept \u201cwall power\u201d paintings that appear to be about nothing much more than painting.In May in New York, two large-scale trademark word paintings by the auction favorite Christopher Wool sold near the low end of their estimates, with the 1990 \u201cChameleon\u201d selling for $13.9 million at Sotheby\u2019s and the 1992 \u201cAnd If You\u201d for $13.6 million at Christie\u2019s. Both were far below the $29.9 million that a similar work, the 1990 \u201cRiot,\u201d brought at Sotheby\u2019s in May 2015.America\u2019s hottest artist right now is arguably Njideka Akunyili Crosby, 33, a Nigerian-born figurative painter in Los Angeles whose meticulous portraits currently are not available to private collectors.Lisa Schiff, an art adviser in New York, and others pointed out that the softening of demand for what has been regarded as blue-chip art might be about more than overambitious estimates or shifting fashions.\u201cSome of my clients are fatigued,\u201d Ms. Schiff said. \u201cBuying art for a private museum or foundation is no longer the most exciting thing.\u201dShe said that people were increasingly valuing the experience of art over acquisition. That has prompted her and the curator Lauri Firstenberg to start an advisory company called there-there (the quirky title is inspired by a Gertrude Stein line) that aims to \u201cdevelop programming and produce projects in collaboration with artists, foundations, corporations and institutions.\u201dArt as an experience, rather than an investment, is gaining traction elsewhere in the market. Hauser & Wirth\u2019s gallery, bar, restaurant and garden complex in rural Somerset has attracted around 273,000 visitors since it opened in July 2014, almost double the 149,000 the company\u2019s London gallery has attracted over the same period.And Joseph Nahmad, the younger brother of the London dealer Helly Nahmad, opened his new Nahmad Projects space in Cork Street in June not with an exhibition of collector-friendly paintings, but with a series of performances by 30 artists.\u201cConsumers worldwide are seeking out experiences,\u201d said Sarah Quinlan, a senior vice president at Mastercard who analyzes luxury spending. \u201cEven the 1 percent is changing,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s not displaying its wealth so obviously.\u201dThis behavioral shift, which Ms. Quinlan compared to patterns of consumer spending after the 1929 Wall Street crash, could potentially be a far more serious threat to the cult of art as an investment than the mere vagaries of collecting taste or the global economy.What happens if it\u2019s no longer cool to own expensive art?An earlier version of this article misstated the title of a Christie\u2019s themed sale in London in May 2015. It was \u201cLooking Forward to the Past,\u201d not \u201cLooking Forward to Tomorrow.\u201d The article also omitted the result of a Swiss investigation into whether a painting by Amedeo Modigliani, \u201cSeated Man With a Cane,\u201d which was in storage in Geneva, had been stolen. In May, a Swiss prosecutor dropped a seizure order on the painting, citing insufficient evidence.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Faces a Surge in Cardiovascular Disease, Study Finds", "Date": "2016-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySinosphereThe study, by Harvard researchers, suggested that changes in lifestyle brought on by China\u2019s fast-paced economic growth over the past three decades had contributed to a sharp rise in cardiovascular diseases, such as heart attacks and strokes.In 1979, for example, when the Chinese government began opening up its economy, roughly 8 percent of Chinese adults had high blood pressure. By 2010, the rate had increased to 34 percent.China\u2019s embrace of Western foods, like red meat and soda, has exacerbated the problem, the researchers found. Fast-food restaurants are wildly popular in many provinces, and obesity is a growing problem, especially among rural children.Decreasing levels of physical activity were also a significant factor, the study found, as more Chinese families have moved to cities from the countryside. Smoking is also widespread, despite efforts by the government to discourage the habit. More than half of Chinese men still smoke.Cardiovascular illnesses have been the leading cause of death in China for at least two decades. But in recent years, heart attacks and strokes have become more common, especially in rural areas. In 2011, 44 percent of the deaths of people over age 35 were the result of cardiovascular disease, the Harvard researchers found.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump Differ on Taxes", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 2016 RaceIf Donald J. Trump wins the White House and proceeds to persuade Congress to pass his tax agenda, middle-class Americans will get a small tax cut, wealthy Americans and businesses will get a huge tax cut, and the budget deficit will widen substantially unless there is the type of economic boom he promises amid lower taxes and lighter regulation.If Hillary Clinton wins the White House and persuades Congress to pass her agenda, wealthy Americans will pay higher taxes, businesses will face tax rules that make it less advantageous to relocate overseas, and the money those changes produce will go to fund the rest of her policy agenda, from child care to roads, bridges and other infrastructure.That, in a nutshell, is the tax policy choice Americans face when they vote in November, based on plans the two candidates have released and discussed in major speeches this week.Of course, campaign proposals never end up in law in exactly the form candidates talk about them on the stump. But tax policy puts some hard numbers on the sometimes vague rhetoric of the campaign trail. It shows where exactly a candidate\u2019s priorities and vision are, in dollars-and-cents terms.Elections have consequences, and this is what those consequences might look like if a President Clinton or a President Trump got Congress to reshape the tax code their way.Mr. Trump also advocates lowering the tax rate on all business income to 15 percent \u2014 and has advocated that the rate apply to all sorts of businesses, including partnerships and sole proprietorships. That opens up room for people to find ways to turn what is now taxed as individual income into \u201cpass-through\u201d business income at that low 15 percent rate, especially those in position to hire tax lawyers to help them figure out the details.For example, an executive who is paid $1 million in salary could instead form a limited liability corporation to \u201csell\u201d $1 million of management services to his or her old company, cutting the tax rate to 15 percent.Mr. Trump also wants to make child care tax-deductible. If the policy were implemented as a typical deduction, it would provide no advantage for the 45 percent of people paying no tax and provide the biggest advantages to people in high-income tax brackets. His campaign has indicated that the Trump administration would find ways to make its advantages shared more broadly, though staffers had no details.She wants a child care tax credit as part of a broader effort to make child care more affordable, and while she has not enumerated all the details of what she has in mind, a refundable credit would avoid the problems created by offering a tax deduction and would be valuable for lower- and middle-income families even if they don\u2019t pay federal income tax.Almost all presidential nominees since 1976 have made their tax returns public, most around Tax Day in April  \u2014 about 200 days before the election.With the new, lower rate, businesses that earn money overseas and currently keep it outside the United States would have less incentive to do so. So they might repatriate money, pay the lower tax and invest it at home.The proposal would sharply reduce the tax burden on companies, reducing government revenue by $1.9 trillion over the next decade, according to the Tax Foundation\u2019s estimate.One provision would change a key rule to make it harder to execute \u201ctax inversions,\u201d in which a United States firm merges with a foreign competitor and moves its corporate headquarters overseas in order to get access to lower taxes in the merger partner\u2019s country. Another would limit the deductibility of interest when it is used as a tool to avoid American taxes. A third provision is an \u201cexit tax\u201d on companies that relocate outside the United States without first repatriating earnings kept abroad.Mrs. Clinton has also pitched tax credits for companies that hire workers from apprenticeships or share profits with their workers. In her speech Thursday, she said she would reduce red tape facing small businesses as they try to pay their taxes.An earlier version of this article misstated an estimate from the Congressional Budget Office of the budget deficit over the coming decade. It\u2019s $9.3 trillion, not $3.5 trillion. That would make cumulative budget deficits over the decade roughly twice as big as they are currently estimated to be, not 3.7 times larger.An earlier version of this article misstated the exemption threshold for the estate tax for a married couple. The first $10.9 million of the estate is exempt from taxation, not the first $12.9 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Election Shows Many South Africans Losing Faith in \u2018Pompous\u2019 A.N.C.", "Date": "2016-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHANTELLE, South Africa \u2014 A week before South Africa\u2019s local elections on Wednesday, the Zithas held a family meeting inside their entertainment room to decide how to vote. Loyal backers of the African National Congress in every election since the end of apartheid, the family decided it was time for a change.Now, on a leisurely Sunday morning, as his wife and daughter got ready for church, Danny Zitha, 61, a former high school teacher, said the long-governing A.N.C. had left him disillusioned because of its corruption, arrogance and incompetence. He will never go back, he said.\u201cNot at all, as long as I\u2019m alive, sorry,\u201d he said, adding with a laugh, \u201cMaybe after death.\u201dThe party\u2019s decline was especially steep in the biggest cities, with many black, middle-class voters in places like Chantelle, a suburb of Pretoria, turning against it. Twenty-two years after the end of apartheid, such voters appeared more concerned with mundane matters like good governance and taxes than with the party\u2019s heroic liberation past.The emergence of real alternatives for voters, and possibly the growing accountability of political parties, are positive steps for South Africa\u2019s democracy, analysts and even A.N.C. officials have said.In Pretoria, the main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, defeated the A.N.C. by two percentage points. The A.N.C.\u2019s share of the vote fell to 41 percent from 55 percent in the last local elections, in 2011.In the voting district including Chantelle, once an all-white community that is now about 90 percent black, the A.N.C.\u2019s share of the vote plummeted to 40 percent from 69 percent in 2011.In many ways, the shifting dynamics inside Chantelle reflect larger forces \u2014 a growing black middle class in a rapidly urbanizing country \u2014 that are detrimental to the A.N.C., which, especially under President Jacob G. Zuma, has relied on patronage to maintain power.As the election results began trickling in last week, A.N.C. officials said they would engage in \u201cintrospection.\u201d But examples from the rest of the continent are not encouraging: Few liberation movements that assumed power have been able to transform themselves with the changing times and needs.Mr. Zitha and his wife, who is also a high school teacher, moved to Chantelle from Mamelodi, an impoverished township, in 1994. They were one of the first black families in an area that had been restricted to whites under apartheid.Now, Mr. Zitha points to his immediate neighbors on his block of detached homes: a government worker and a prison warden on one side; a government worker, a lawyer and a high school teacher on the other side \u2014 all solid members of the black middle-class. Sensible cars like Toyotas are parked in his garage and those of his neighbors, though some Mercedes-Benzes can also be spotted in Chantelle.\u201cIt\u2019s a popular car here, even though I feel it\u2019s quite heavy to maintain a Mercedes-Benz for a middle-class person like myself,\u201d Mr. Zitha said. \u201dYou\u2019re just pretending to be what you\u2019re not supposed to be.\u201dIn all the previous national and local elections since 1994, Mr. Zitha, his wife and their two older children, after they came of age, voted for the A.N.C. Even so, Mr. Zitha became increasingly dissatisfied with the party\u2019s stewardship of the economy, its upkeep of Chantelle and its culture of corruption under Mr. Zuma.\u201cThey\u2019re driving 4x4s, Range Rovers, all those fancy cars,\u201d he said of A.N.C. officials. \u201cThose guys are pompous. They\u2019re just working for themselves and their close relatives.\u201dPerhaps not surprisingly, it was the Zithas\u2019 youngest child who began questioning the family\u2019s loyalty to the A.N.C.Tshegofatso Zitha, 21, an electrical engineering student, is a \u201cborn-free,\u201d as black South Africans born after the end of apartheid are called. When she was 15, Ms. Zitha recalled, she learned in school about rape, and began worrying about the large, open field next to her street.Criminals often hid in that field, robbing people of their cellphones. Burglars broke into the Zithas\u2019 house five times over the years. Finding the local A.N.C. official unresponsive, she and some other young women in the area began to carry whistles.\u201cI thought it wasn\u2019t fair because we voted the A.N.C. into leadership here, but we had to find other ways to stay safe,\u201d Ms. Zitha said.She also looked at the adjacent ward, which had been led for some time by the Democratic Alliance. \u201cThat place, it\u2019s clean, it\u2019s safe,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we want.\u201dVoting for the first time in 2014, Ms. Zitha backed the Economic Freedom Fighters, a leftist group that finished third in last week\u2019s voting. The rest of her family voted that year for the A.N.C.She waited until mid-2015 before going to work on her parents and older siblings.\u201cI wanted to see if the A.N.C. would do anything that would benefit any of us in any way,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I asked my family, \u2018Do you see any difference?\u2019 And they said, \u2018No.\u2019\u201dAnd so by the time the family got together before the latest election, the Zithas had made up their minds. Mr. Zitha was particularly upset, because he thought the local A.N.C.-led government had failed to provide good services despite rising property taxes.\u201cLook at it \u2014 this is too much,\u201d he said, holding a monthly bill for about $80 in taxes and municipal fees.The Zithas decided to vote for the Economic Freedom Fighters, though they also liked the Democratic Alliance, as did many of their neighbors.One of them, Bongo Matjila, 58, who is also a high school teacher, drove by in his Ford pickup. \u201cWe\u2019re friends, we\u2019re brothers, even though we voted for different parties,\u201d Mr. Zitha said, as the two neighbors bantered in his driveway.\u201cWe\u2019ve got a common enemy\u201d Mr. Matjila said.\u201cYeah, if the enemy is this man, we must try hard to get him out of the city,\u201d Mr. Zitha said. \u201cAnd we got him out.\u201dAn hour later, just a few blocks away, a black Mercedes van pulled into a driveway, containing three A.N.C. supporters active in ward politics. All were from families with deep ties to the A.N.C., and they said they would never quit the party.\u201cI\u2019m used to eating pap,\u201d said one of them, Mogomotsi Mogomotsi, 21, who owns a construction and supply company, referring to the ground corn that is South Africa\u2019s staple.Goms Matabane, 24, who was wearing an A.N.C. baseball cap, said he was extremely disappointed by the election results.\u201cBut I\u2019m not really surprised,\u201d he added, \u201cbecause I\u2019ve been hearing a lot of people saying they\u2019ve lost faith in the A.N.C.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "America\u2019s Global Corruption Crusade", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe answer, in simplest terms, is that American officials have come to see corruption as a major cause of global instability \u2014 hindering development, deepening poverty and undermining people\u2019s faith in their governments. It becomes not just a problem for the countries where the corruption occurs but a threat to American national security.The Department of Justice has managed to freeze $2.8 billion in the 28 public cases the kleptocracy team has pursued so far, many of which continue. Of that money, the government has returned roughly $145 million to the intended recipients of the funds. That is a modest but important step in the right direction. In addition to litigation, American diplomats have taken aim at corrupt officials abroad by canceling visas and by funding local anticorruption efforts.A long-term solution to the problem will require more stringent international norms. Opening bank accounts, and registering property under aliases, remains unreasonably easy, even in the United States. And nations are only now creating protocols to allow governments to share information about taxpayers who have assets in more than one country. Until legislation and international agreements roll back banking secrecy, prosecutors cannot be expected to accomplish more than taking down a few egregious offenders each year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Think Tanks Amplify Corporate America\u2019s Influence", "Date": "2016-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThis can become a productive, mutually beneficial relationship,\u201d Bruce Katz, a Brookings vice president, wrote to Lennar in July 2010. The ultimate benefit for Brookings: $400,000 in donations from Lennar\u2019s different divisions.\u201cHe would be a trusted adviser,\u201d an internal Brookings memo said in 2014 as the think tank sought one $100,000 donation from Lennar.Think tanks, which position themselves as \u201cuniversities without students,\u201d have power in government policy debates because they are seen as researchers independent of moneyed interests. But in the chase for funds, think tanks are pushing agendas important to corporate donors, at times blurring the line between researchers and lobbyists. And they are doing so while reaping the benefits of their tax-exempt status, sometimes without disclosing their connections to corporate interests.Similar arrangements exist at many think tanks. On issues as varied as military sales to foreign countries, international trade, highway management systems and real estate development, think tanks have frequently become vehicles for corporate influence and branding campaigns.The shift has occurred as nonprofits in general have been under increasing pressure from their donors to meet specific goals. But for think tanks, that pressure can threaten their standing as independent arbiters in policy debates in Congress, the White House and the news media.\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice to go back to the greatest generation, in the post-World War II era of philanthropy, where they said, gosh, \u2018Here is $1 million; spend it how you wish,\u2019\u201d Kimberly Churches, the managing director at Brookings, said in an interview.Think tank executives reject any suggestion that they are tools of corporate influence campaigns and say they are simply teaming up with donors that have similar goals, like helping cities with economic development.But he acknowledged that the arrangement to appoint the Lennar executive as a senior fellow had created the \u201cappearance of a conflict of interest.\u201d And he said that Brookings, in the interest of transparency, had recently decided to prohibit corporations or corporate-backed foundations from making anonymous contributions.Still, the benefits afforded to corporations looking to cloak themselves with the authority of think tanks are strikingly evident, according to a review of documents from more than a dozen institutions.The likely conclusions of some think tank reports, documents show, are discussed with donors \u2014 or even potential ones \u2014 before the research is complete. Drafts of the studies have been shared with donors whose opinions have then helped shape final reports. Donors have outlined how the resulting scholarship will be used as part of broader lobbying efforts. The think tanks also help donors promote their corporate brands, as Brookings does with JPMorgan Chase, whose $15.5 million contribution is the largest by a private corporation in the institution\u2019s history.Despite these benefits, corporations can write off the donations as charitable contributions. Some tax experts say these arrangements may amount to improper subsidies by taxpayers if think tanks are providing specific services.The Brookings Institution \u2014 long recognized as one of the most prestigious think tanks in the world \u2014 has aggressively courted corporate donors over the last decade, particularly for its Metropolitan Policy Program, which formed partnerships with JPMorgan Chase, Lennar Corporation, K.K.R., Hitachi and others. Here is an examination of the deals with these donors, based in part on thousands of pages of internal Brookings documents.Executives at Brookings, the Center for Strategic and International Studies and other think tanks say they have systems in place to ensure that their reports are based on scholars\u2019 independent conclusions.\u201c\u2018Are you going to say drones are bad?\u2019\u201d she recalled one potential financial backer asking. \u201c\u2018We are not interested in funding something that says drones are bad.\u2019\u201dThe confidential Brookings spreadsheet had an unassuming title: Corporate Overviews Tracking. It listed nearly 90 corporations, from Alcoa to Wells Fargo, providing a glimpse of the vast electronic file that Brookings maintained on donors and prospects, and the benefits it might offer.The database, along with thousands of pages of emails, solicitations for money and memos on meetings with corporate officials, highlighted Brookings\u2019s practice of assuring that donors would see results from their contributions.The files included company priorities and a tally of donations. General Electric wanted to fund work on rail networks and clean energy programs \u2014 both critical parts of its business \u2014 and Brookings then featured G.E. executives, joined by officials from the White House and Congress, at events that focused on these industries.From the start, the program blended a variety of insights on urban matters, including from corporate, nonprofit and government sources. And Mr. Indyk noted that any reports issued were made public.Donations to the program exploded, from $4.3 million in 2005 to $12.5 million in 2013, nearly 20 percent of Brookings\u2019s overall program spending that year.In advance of a 2014 event Brookings officials attended with corporate executives including Henry R. Kravis, a co-chairman of K.K.R., one memo marked as confidential noted: \u201cK.K.R. has given a total of $350K to Brookings. Last gift came in on 3/27/2014 for $150K to Metro; Henry has donated $75K to Brookings, most going to the individual unrestricted fund.\u201dThe tally demonstrates the important distinction that Brookings makes between \u201cunrestricted\u201d donations, which the think tank can spend on any research, and project-based funding restricted to specific topics that the donor has a particular interest in.The San Francisco project generated controversy from the beginning, with critics concerned about toxic waste left by the former Navy shipyard.A spokesman for Lennar, Glenn Bunting, disputed claims that the company had donated to Brookings out of self-interest \u2014 and said the alliance was not related to the protests.\u201cThere was nothing needed in the way of assistance for Lennar to \u2018buy\u2019 from Brookings,\u201d Mr. Bunting said in an email. Brookings, though, continued to promote the project.The think tank soon delivered.But Mr. Indyk acknowledged that naming Mr. Bonner, who declined to be interviewed, a Brookings nonresident scholar had \u201ccreated the impression that because Lennar was giving money, he was getting the title.\u201d His post, which was unpaid, was not renewed.Officials at Brookings said they had not lobbied for Hitachi, and they provided examples of reports that they said included conclusions challenging the company\u2019s position. \u201cHelping a corporation\u2019s for-profit agenda is not in any way our agenda,\u201d Ms. Churches, the managing director, said.Yet Ms. Churches also said the contract language with donors like Lennar and Hitachi was \u201cinelegant,\u201d although not improper.When asked if the documents read like a fee-for-service agreement, she said, \u201cIt could be misconstrued.\u201dMr. Indyk said Brookings had recently changed its policies so that \u201ctoday, there is no way in which those words would be used in our documents.\u201dThe project was premised on a common interest between the bank and the think tank. Brookings wanted to promote economic growth in cities by encouraging international trade, and JPMorgan wanted to gain new business by offering loans to companies in the same markets.Mr. Indyk and executives from JPMorgan said the company and the think tank simply agreed on a worthy agenda.\u201cThis was about growing the economy, and we are incredibly proud of the results of this initiative,\u201d said Peter Scher, the head of the corporate responsibility program at JPMorgan. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s had a huge impact in more than 30 cities that are involved.\u201dAt the same time, hundreds of pages of memos \u2014 status reports to JPMorgan, internal reports by Brookings staff to prepare for meetings with top bank executives, and formal documents soliciting more money \u2014 make clear that Brookings saw the Global Cities Initiative as a branding effort that could help JPMorgan bolster its standing in cities.And Brookings was ready to do its part.At times, Brookings officials seemed worried they were not doing enough for the bank.\u201cNo one wants to create overt marketing opportunities for JPMC, but we need to carve out roles and thought leadership opportunity for market presidents,\u201d said a 2013 Brookings memo, referring to a dinner with the bank\u2019s executives. \u201cWe need to do a better job tying it back to JPMC.\u201dIt remains difficult to assess whether the relationship helped the bank\u2019s business, but Mr. Scher said that was not the goal.\u201cIf the Global Cities Initiative strengthens the economic competitiveness of cities, it\u2019s a win for small businesses, job creation and everyone involved in these communities, including us,\u201d Mr. Scher said in a statement.Donations from the corporations to Brookings are tax exempt based on the premise that the think tank\u2019s work benefits the public good, not a company\u2019s bottom line.\u201cTax deductions are subsidies that are paid for by all taxpayers,\u201d Ms. Fleischer said. \u201cAnd the reason the subsidy is provided is that the charitable organization is supposed to be doing something for the public good, not that specifically benefits the private individual or corporation in the form of providing them goods or services.\u201dMr. Indyk said that opinion was \u201ctotally unfounded,\u201d noting that Brookings had retained its own lawyers to review the documents and found no problems.Other think tanks have been even more closely aligned with corporate agendas.The Atlantic Council, which has seen its annual revenue grow to $21 million from $2 million in the last decade, offers access to United States and foreign government officials in exchange for contributions. Individual donors, like FedEx, have also helped fund specific reports that align with their agendas.Six months before the Atlantic Council report was issued, FedEx and the think tank worked on plans to use the report as a lobbying tool.FedEx and the Atlantic Council, working with the European American Chamber of Commerce, also told companies being asked to participate in the study that the goal was to \u201cemphasize the positive impact that a comprehensive agreement would have on American and European small businesses.\u201dAn executive vice president at FedEx, Rajesh Subramaniam, attended an event at Atlantic Council headquarters in Washington to celebrate the release of the final report. So did a key supporter, Representative Erik Paulsen, Republican of Minnesota.Frederick Kempe, the Atlantic Council president, said that FedEx had donated just $20,000 to help fund the effort and that the staff at the Atlantic Council had handled the research.\u201cThere is no doubt the work of think tanks has more credibility than the work of lobbyists, but the only way we preserve it is through intellectual independence,\u201d Mr. Kempe said.General Atomics, the California-based manufacturer of Predator drones, had a clear problem. Prospects for sales were falling as the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq wound down. The company wanted the Obama administration to change its policy to allow for sales to other countries, a lucrative proposition.At about that time, the industry turned to the Center for Strategic and International Studies for help, providing money that the think tank used to conduct a study on drone policy, including exports.While defense contracting giants like Lockheed Martin and Boeing have cumulatively donated at least $77 million since 2010 to two dozen think tanks, disclosure records show, General Atomics\u2019s contribution to the Center for Strategic and International Studies was quite small \u2014 in the tens of thousands of dollars.As General Atomics was lobbying for a change in export rules governing its unmanned aerial vehicles, it helped fund a report at the Center for Strategic and International Studies that also pushed for the change.As a think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies did not file a lobbying report, but the goals of the effort were clear.Boeing and Lockheed Martin, drone makers that were major C.S.I.S. contributors, were also invited to attend the sessions, the emails show. The meetings and research culminated with a report released in February 2014 that reflected the industry\u2019s priorities.\u201cI came out strongly in support of export,\u201d Mr. Brannen, the lead author of the study, wrote in an email to Kenneth B. Handelman, the deputy assistant secretary of state for defense trade controls.But the effort did not stop there.Mr. Brannen, who has since left C.S.I.S., declined to comment. The think tank insisted that its efforts to influence administration policy were not lobbying.\u201cC.S.I.S. will not represent any donor before any government office or entity, including congressional lawmakers and executive branch officials,\u201d Mr. Hamre, the chief executive, said in his statement to The Times. \u201cWe do not lobby.\u201dOne thing is clear: The result was a victory for General Atomics.A State Department spokesman said that while the government officials involved in the review had received opinions from think tanks and industry officials, \u201cat the end of the day, this is a considered U.S. government policy.\u201dLater, after he had joined the Hudson Institute and helped create the Center for American Seapower, he approached Huntington officials again, and they were interested.\u201cA think tank has more prestige,\u201d Mr. McGrath said.Huntington Ingalls paid $100,000 to fund the work, a critical commitment for Mr. McGrath, who said he was paid by Hudson only if he could successfully solicit donations to support his research.Mr. McGrath said he had always been a strong proponent of aircraft carriers, so the company was not buying his opinion.\u201cThe Hudson Center makes no secret about being very pro-sea power,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a company came that wanted us to write a piece that advocated for something other than that, the answer would be no.\u201dIn exchange for Huntington Ingalls\u2019s support, company officials were given regular briefings on the research and the opportunity to suggest revisions to early drafts, Mr. McGrath said.Huntington Ingalls, the sole builder of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers in the United States, and other players in the shipbuilding industry were looking for ways to increase or maintain funding for the construction of these giant ships. They turned to think tanks for help. Here is a look at the strategy, which involved the Hudson Institute and others.\u201cWe have an iterative process already laid out in which we will sit down with them and go through drafts and discuss where we are going,\u201d Mr. McGrath said. He added that he had not accepted all of the company\u2019s suggestions.The strategy \u2014 lining up think tank reports as lobbying tools that echoed each other \u2014 was backed up with a series of letters to the editor, dozens of posts on Twitter and Facebook, and op-ed pieces.Mr. McGrath said he, too, wondered if this storm of industry-funded work might be threatening the integrity of the process.\u201cI see a lot of stuff that comes out in Washington,\u201d Mr. McGrath said, \u201cand I got to scratch my head and say, \u2018That guy must be on the payroll.\u2019\u201dBrooke Williams is a reporter at the New England Center for Investigative Reporting, which collaborated with The New York Times on this series.

A Vermont Contest Has Trouble Finding Takers", "Date": "2016-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHARDWICK, Vt. \u2014 Like most people who work for small newspapers, Vanessa Fournier wears many hats.A photographer, she shoots pictures for The Hardwick Gazette, the weekly broadsheet that has been documenting life here in Vermont\u2019s hardscrabble Northeast Kingdom since 1889. On Wednesdays, she is the paper\u2019s local distributor. With bundles of the freshly printed Gazette tucked into the trunk of her Honda Civic, Ms. Fournier, 61, makes her way through town, plunking down papers on countertops, slipping them into wire racks and keeping up a cheerful patter with shopkeepers.Now, she worries that both jobs could end.Unfortunately for him, the contest has not generated the interest that he had hoped would make his plan financially viable. So he has extended the deadline to Sept. 20 from Aug. 11.When asked if he had a Plan C if he had still not received enough entries in a month, he offered a blunt analogy: He could extend the deadline again, he said, but that would be \u201clike pounding your thumb with a hammer \u2014 it\u2019s not going to stop hurting.\u201dThat could sum up the newspaper business these days, at least for many big dailies, which have been upended by the internet and are in a frantic race to reinvent themselves to stay relevant in today\u2019s crowded and fragmented news media environment. The New England landscape is dotted with papers of significant lineage, many of them going through upheavals in ownership as they struggle to survive.But, Mr. Benton cautioned, the ad base can dry up, especially in the era of Amazon and big-box stores.The Gazette has been operating for 127 years, growing along with the town\u2019s granite industry. Work at the quarries peaked in 1910, as did Hardwick\u2019s population, hitting 3,200. The town then retrenched as it returned to its agricultural roots.Mr. Connelly, a trim man with close-cropped white hair and a steady gaze, who has carved out a small sitting space in front of piles of paper on his overstuffed wooden desk, has been the Gazette\u2019s steward for three decades. He is determined to find someone to whom to pass the torch.But when the contest closed Aug. 11, he had not received the 700 essays that he said was the minimum needed to make the contest financially viable. He would not say how many he had received, nor would he share the contents of the entries, saying he did not want to skew the judging.He did say that the paper, which has a paid circulation of 2,200, grossed $240,000 last year. He had figured that, with a contest entry fee of $175, 700 essays would yield enough, $122,500, to cover the Gazette building, computers and taxes and send him on his glide to retirement.He has a few guesses about why not enough entries materialized.\u201cMaybe the people who have experience know that you\u2019re not going to get rich and you\u2019re going to work your butt off,\u201d he said. \u201cThe hours are long and the pay is not great, and so they were smart enough to say, \u2018I don\u2019t want any part of this.\u2019\u201d\u201cAnd,\u201d he added, \u201cthere\u2019s a generation and a half now of people who don\u2019t even know what a newspaper is.\u201dWhat it is not, he said, is social media. \u201cFor someone to hold up a Facebook post as journalism is kind of an affront,\u201d he said.Journalism at The Gazette consists of keeping track of local government and the goings on here and in a few surrounding towns: With milk prices falling, for example, dairy farmers are banding together to increase their clout. The nearby town of Craftsbury, a Gazette reporter wrote, is \u201cjoining the 21st century\u201d with high-speed internet.Mr. Connelly says that he has also covered topics that some readers objected to, including a big bank scandal involving a local resident and the harassment of a transgender police officer by a town official.The paper, running 10 or 12 pages, is filled with the staples of community weeklies: local sports, calendars, birth announcements and obituaries, the police blotter and reviews of artistic endeavors. In last week\u2019s edition, one correspondent, Michael Bielawski, wrote five of the seven front-page stories.\u201cYou have to keep going back and become a familiar face to them, and then they begin to understand that we\u2019re a local business just like they are,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you have to spend four hours to get two ads, that\u2019s what you do.\u201dMr. Connelly takes a dim view of the headphone-wearing, phone-obsessed, plugged-in culture. So it is little surprise that The Gazette has avoided being available online.\u201cI don\u2019t believe in giving away my product,\u201d Mr. Connelly said. \u201cThat was one of the big mistakes newspapers made, because now you have people thinking it\u2019s free.\u201dIn his view, the hard copy of the paper fosters civic engagement in a way that a smartphone does not.\u201cWhen you pick up your paper, you may see a headline or a photograph that will grab your attention, and you\u2019ll say to the cashier or the person next to you, \u2018Did you see that?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt brings people together. It is a building block of democracy.\u201dNor is he impressed with social media; the anonymity of it, he said, can breed anarchy. By contrast, he prints letters to the editor only if they include the writer\u2019s signature, name, address and phone number.Mr. Connelly and his wife initially lived on the second floor of the Gazette building. Their son, Sawyer, 25, who works for a wildlife conservation group in Montana, wrote on the contest website his reminiscence of growing up at the paper.On production nights, he said, he would curl up under his mother\u2019s desk with the family dog \u201cand fall asleep amidst the sounds of keystrokes and the smell of coffee and ink.\u201dHe said that he and his father were unprepared to deal with his mother\u2019s death. The Gazette, he said, \u201cwas very much the two of them.\u201dNow, he said, \u201cand I\u2019m sure my mother would agree, it\u2019s time for my father to begin his next adventure.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rio Games Highlight Problems With the Olympic Model", "Date": "2016-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySports of The TimesRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Proud and beautiful as this seaside city is, glorious as the feats of athleticism and sportsmanship were these past two weeks, these Games underline that the Olympic model is fractured.As we depart, Rio de Janeiro is left with stadiums for which it has little use and swimming pools far removed from the working class who could dearly use them. Tens of thousands of residents were displaced, a golf course sits atop a former nature preserve, and the towers of the athletes\u2019 village will have a second life as luxury housing. Rio\u2019s state government turns its pockets inside out looking for money to pay salaries and to keep hospitals open. The army withdraws, and fears rise that crime will spiral.The International Olympic Committee has taken steps toward reform. But what it demands of nations is basically unchanged: Build us expensive monuments with a shelf life of two weeks. The I.O.C. has no hammer to bring down when cities fail to deliver on environmental promises.There is a more sustainable and less ruinous path, and I will get to that. First, I should wrestle with the challenge tossed down by my colleague Roger Cohen. He is an incisive, humane observer, and he argued that critics have the Rio Olympics all wrong.His perspective should be reckoned with, even as I disagreed with nearly every word.He argued that the developed world harbors an antipathy for grand sporting events held in the developing world.I would turn his formulation on its head. The greatest honor we can pay to a nation is to take its maladies seriously. Brazil overthrew a dictatorship and remains a gloriously messy democracy. Yet police and paramilitary violence and human rights violations accompany its grand sporting events. Brazilian officials, desperate to tamp down the vicious drug gangs before the Olympics, let the army and the police ratchet up violence, to the point that last year the police committed one-fifth of the homicides in Rio.Corruption scarred these Games, as contractors and politicians sluiced hundreds of millions of dollars into their coffers. Brave journalists here exposed this, and Brazilian prosecutors, to their credit, investigated the metastasizing scandals. Earlier this year, the scion of the nation\u2019s largest construction companies, Odebrecht, an investor in the athletes\u2019 housing, was sentenced to 19 years in prison for his role in another political scandal.We would do well to stanch any North American impulse toward self-righteousness. The United States walked this twisted path, too. Our Salt Lake 2002 Winter Olympics were a bacchanalia of bribes, doping and corruption.My colleague Cohen claimed to detect another double standard; he could recall no reporters poking around impoverished corners of London during its Summer Olympics. If that is so, that is our failure.\u201cThey said they had obligations to their contractors,\u201d Lina Jamoul, an organizer told me at the time. \u201cWe said: \u2018What you have is a bureaucracy. That isn\u2019t our problem.\u2019\u201dActivists in London also applied concerted pressure to get the Olympic corporation to create 2,000 units of affordable housing after the Games.The Rio Olympics offer nods toward a sustainable future. The handball courts, an example of nomadic architecture, will be dismantled and used to build schools. The media center will become dorms, and sections of the Olympic center could become a public park.There was, however, no movement to ensure livable wages for workers. And not a single flat in the towers where the athletes were housed will be reserved for working-class and poor Cariocas. The developers obtained the public land for free. A recessionary housing market does threaten their profit margin, which is a pity.More to the point, the loudest protests about these Olympics came not from Berkeley or Oxford but from within Rio de Janeiro. Labor unions, teachers and activists on either side of the coastal mountains that divide this city joined in marches. Their anger, coupled with a wounded economy, might account for the thousands of empty seats seen here these past two weeks.\u201cWe liked the talk of the Olympics at first,\u201d noted Carla Maria Avesani, who runs a respected nutrition institute at Rio de Janeiro\u2019s state university, which has suffered grievous cuts in pay and services. \u201cThen Brazilians awoke from this dream. It became a nightmare.\u201dSo what\u2019s the solution? We could place the Games in Los Angeles, London or Paris, or seek a permanent home in Athens, which has historical and emotional resonance.\u201cI very much understand the I.O.C.\u2019s desire to be more equitable in delivering the Olympics to the developing world,\u201d said Allen Hershkowitz, the founder of Green Sports International, who is an environmental consultant to pro sports leagues and the Olympics. \u201cBut the Sochi and Rio Olympics indicate that there are such huge environmental, transportation, water and air-quality questions.\u201dTo retreat to the cities of the Northern Hemisphere, however, strikes me \u2014 and Hershkowitz \u2014 as a defeat.What if the I.O.C. instead had awarded Rio de Janeiro three cycles of Olympics: 2016, 2020 and 2024? City officials would have time to learn and grow, to ride out a bad recession and market Rio as a true Olympic city. Activists might have forced the Olympics to truly integrate into the lifeblood of the city, incorporating favelas no less than the beach community of Barra. They might have demanded that the athletes\u2019 towers become mixed-income housing. They might demand living wages and true apprenticeship programs. Sewage treatment plants could come on line over the course of a decade.(I opposed the efforts of the former mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to bring the Olympics to New York, the cacophonous echo chamber that is my native city. But I admired his equitable proposal to put Olympic swimming pools and kayak routes in far-flung city parks.)Olympic officials would also possess a stick: If city leaders did not offer measurable progress, the I.O.C. could withdraw the next two rounds of Games.Such a plan offers much for prospective Winter Olympics sites as well. Argentine or Chilean developers in the Andes \u2014 or Russians in Sochi, for that matter \u2014 would have time to build out world-class and environmentally sensitive winter sports resorts over 12 years, cushioned by the security of Olympic branding. (Tennis\u2019s biggest events, from Wimbledon to the United States, French and Australian Opens, build out their businesses in this fashion year after year. The United States Tennis Association recently added renewable energy and recycling at Flushing Meadows.)\u201cYou can\u2019t just do this for a one-month event; it\u2019s got to be a decades-long planning,\u201d Hershkowitz said. \u201cOtherwise, you\u2019re left with empty stadiums and a wrecked environment.\u201dI\u2019m no dour Puritan; I love great athletics. My heart leapt as I watched Usain Bolt fly down the track and Simone Biles spin and flip as if exempt from the laws of gravity. To stand in the legendary Maracan\u00e3 stadium for the gold medal men\u2019s soccer game and listen as Brazilians transformed it into a joyous asylum was a wonder.Cariocas were gracious, from Copacabana baristas to an impoverished 64-year-old, Marie Auxiliadora, who invited me into her home in Favela do Mandela to listen to her upset with these too-expensive Games.One day, perhaps even next time, we can deliver a sustainable Olympics worthy of them.Email: powellm@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Win, Lose, but No Compromise", "Date": "2016-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnyone who says it doesn\u2019t matter whether Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton wins this election needs their head examined. The damage that Trump could do to our nation with his blend of intellectual laziness, towering policy ignorance and reckless impulsiveness is in a league of its own. Hillary has some real personal ethics issues she needs to confront, but she\u2019s got the chops to be president.What interests me most right now, though, is a different question. It\u2019s not, \u201cWho are they \u2014 our politicians?\u201d It\u2019s, \u201cWho are we \u2014 the voters?\u201dTo be specific: Are we all just Shiites and Sunnis now?More and more of our politics resembles the core sectarian conflict in the Middle East between these two branches of Islam, and that is not good. Because whether you\u2019re talking about Shiites and Sunnis \u2014 or Iranians and Saudis, Israelis and Palestinians, Turks and Kurds \u2014 a simple binary rule dominates their politics: \u201cI am strong, why should I compromise? I am weak, how can I compromise?\u201dWith rare exceptions, the politics of the Middle East is just a seesaw game between those two modes of zero-sum, rule-or-die thinking. Rarely, these days, does either party stop to seek or forge common ground. It\u2019s just: I am strong, so I don\u2019t have to meet you in the middle, or I am weak, so I can\u2019t meet you in the middle. You can see how well it\u2019s worked for them.That kind of sectarian/tribal thinking, now reinforced by left-right social media enforcers, gerrymandering and giant campaign funders, gives you the sorry spectacle of House Speaker Paul Ryan saying, without embarrassment, that Trump\u2019s pronouncements are a \u201ctextbook\u201d example of racism, but he\u2019s supporting Trump anyway.And it gives you the sorry spectacle of Clinton surrogates turning themselves into pretzels to defend her, even though it\u2019s obvious that she embraced a pattern of major donors to the Clinton Foundation being given preferential access to her as secretary of state.Shiites stick with Shiites. Sunnis stick with Sunnis. It\u2019s rule or die, baby. Nothing else matters.That is not always true in other walks of life. We just got that lesson at the Olympics. American runner Abbey D\u2019Agostino clipped New Zealand\u2019s Nikki Hamblin from behind in the women\u2019s 5000-meter qualifying heat, sending both tumbling to the ground well short of the finish.Contrast that with the Egyptian Olympic judoka who, under pressure from his society, refused to shake hands with his Israeli opponent. And how\u2019s Egypt doing these days? Drifting aimlessly.Yes, I know, politics ain\u2019t bean bag. It\u2019s about winning. But it\u2019s also about winning with a mandate to govern. And right now, everything suggests that the next four years will be just like the last eight: a gridlocked, toxic, Sunni-Shiite, Democrat-Republican civil war, with little search for common ground. That\u2019s how you ruin, not run, a great country.How will we improve Obamacare? How will we invest in infrastructure? How will we recreate the compromise on immigration that a few brave Republican and Democratic legislators tried in 2013? How will we get corporate tax reform, a carbon tax and some fiscal policy that we so desperately need to propel the economy and control the deficit?There is no doubt that Republicans during the Obama presidency pioneered and perfected this scorched-earth politics and have now paid a price for it. They let themselves be led around by a group of no-compromise talk-radio gasbags, think-tank ideologues in the pay of one industry or another, Fox News know-nothings and an alt-right fringe, who, together, so poisoned the G.O.P. garden that an invasive species, Donald Trump, just took it over.That is all the more reason for Clinton to reach out, at the right time, and see if any of them have learned their lesson. There is no way she\u2019ll get anything big done otherwise. We have to break this fever.As Americans, we were once summoned by our politics to be participants in a race to the moon. Lately we\u2019ve been summoned by our politics to be spectators in a race to the bottom. We can do better, and we must.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Rare Agreement on Climate Rules", "Date": "2016-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialWith most of President Obama\u2019s efforts to combat climate change tied up in litigation, it is heartening, if not downright astonishing, to see an industry targeted by an aggressive rule to reduce greenhouse gases welcoming that rule. It is also heartening to be able to provide proof to a reflexively hostile Congress \u2014 whose members yap incessantly about \u201cjob-killing regulations\u201d and \u201cexecutive overreach\u201d \u2014 that regulators and industry can, in fact, produce a mutually acceptable result.The rule completes a suite of ambitious standards that, over time, are expected to deliver not only cleaner big rigs but also cars and S.U.V.s with double the fuel efficiency of current models. Collectively, these standards are an indispensable element of President Obama\u2019s effort to meet his commitment at the December 2015 climate summit meeting in Paris to reduce America\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.There are aspects of this agreement worth celebrating besides its positive effect on the planet. One is the trucking industry\u2019s thumbs up \u2014 a rare departure from the legal blitzkrieg that has greeted most of the administration\u2019s other efforts to reduce greenhouse gases. Industry groups and 27 states have joined in a lawsuit against an important new rule that would limit carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants; oil and gas interests, with 15 states, have filed suits against a rule that would reduce emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, from oil and natural gas operations.In this case, industry looked beyond the technological hurdles and saw benefits, the main one being that the $12,000 per vehicle cost of upgrading the fleet would be more than outweighed by projected fuel savings of $170 billion over 10 to 12 years. And executives knew it was long past time to upgrade a category of vehicles that average a minuscule six miles a gallon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The E.U. Is in Crisis. Two Economists Disagree on Why.", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionAmericans tend to struggle to grasp the ways of the European Union, which admittedly are complex and often arcane. It\u2019s unhelpful that much of the writing on the continent\u2019s seminal postwar project lapses into the same euro-jargon that the union\u2019s technocrats and think tanks employ. Many Europeans can\u2019t make sense of it either, which is one explanation for the triumphant Brexit vote and the historically low trust in the E.U. that Europeans everywhere express today. The community is indisputably mired in its most acute crisis since its founding in the 1950s.Yet contemporary Europe is incomprehensible without it, so thoroughly does the E.U.\u2019s existence suffuse the everyday lives of its 508 million citizens, the governance of the 28 member states and a $15\u202ftrillion economy. This is why the short\u00adish, lucid books of the Brussels-based journal editor Giles Merritt and the American economist James K. Galbraith deserve particular attention. In accessible prose flush with strong argument, they diagnose the E.U.\u2019s problems \u2014 and offer prescriptions on how to deal with them. Though the community is currently preoccupied with Britain\u2019s vote to leave, the influx of migrants, an economy still reeling from the financial crisis, the ascent of far-right parties and a declining global market share, both authors believe deeply in the E.U.In order to get at the community\u2019s core deficiencies, Merritt first punctures some of the myths that unfairly damage its credibility. A favorite of euroskeptics is that the E.U. is a gigantic, autonomous \u201csuperstate\u201d that runs Europe from Brussels. In fact, the E.U.\u2019s largest body and its executive arm, the European Commission, has a staff of just 23,000, smaller than many national government ministries.Moreover, most E.U. legislation is not in the form of written law, but rather \u201cdirectives\u201d to the states, whose legislatures then turn them into law. The heavy lifting is done by the member states. As for autonomy, it is the states that drive the E.U., whether through their national ministers in the Council of Ministers, one of the E.U.\u2019s legislative bodies, or the commission, where state appointees deal with everything from agriculture to consumer protection. The governments call the shots, and it is therefore at their feet that Merritt lays most of the blame for the E.U.\u2019s malaise.In the same vein, the E.U. has come under fire for its policies guaranteeing workers\u2019 freedom of movement within the union. In the Brexit campaign, anti-E.U. voices charged that its provisions enabled Central Europeans to swamp Britain. In fact, demographic analyses show that northern Europe needs many kinds of workers now and will increasingly require more in decades to come. Although European politicians know this too, many can\u2019t sell this argument to their electorates, just one example of the dichotomy that pits the interests of elected national officials against those of the greater good, embodied in the E.U.Merritt, despite his substantial respect for the E.U., argues that bold, sweeping reforms are imperative to meet the challenges of the 21st century. Global warming, terrorism, globalized markets, mass migration, militarized geopolitics and the digital revolution all require supranational attention. On their own, he argues, the individual nation states of Europe, Britain included, are doomed to irrelevance.Yet there\u2019s much more consensus on the union\u2019s shortcomings than on how to address them. The so-called democratic deficit, for instance, refers to the lack of transparency and accountability in the E.U.\u2019s decision-making process. The council, the \u201ctrue legislative body,\u201d meets behind closed doors. The European Parliament\u2019s elected M.P.s exercise some power, yet no one is held responsible for failure. And then there are the unelected civil servants. No democratic state worth its salt would permit such basic transgressions of democratic procedure. But the E.U., Merritt charges, gets away with it.Furthermore, the E.U.\u2019s rigidity undermines its ability to promote innovation. Europe lags woefully behind the United States and China in turning digital technology into commercial success. Meager investment in R&D has hurt Europe\u2019s productivity and thus global competitiveness, causing Europe\u2019s share of the international market to stagnate while its rivals post gains. In more ways than one, Merritt argues convincingly, the E.U. is stuck in the 20th century.Until the Brexit vote, the single greatest blow to the E.U. had been the post-2008 tribulations of the euro, called the eurocrisis, which manifested itself as a devastating debt problem that upended the economies of southern Europe and Ireland. The threat of insolvency forced the wealthier northern Europeans, above all Germany, to bail out the troubled nations at high cost, both financially and in terms of good will.James K. Galbraith, the son of the great Keynesian economist John Kenneth Galbraith, had, as an adviser to the left-wing Syriza government in Greece, a front-row seat at pivotal moments in the showdown between the E.U. (and the International Monetary Fund, too) and Greece, the hardest hit of the debtor nations. The E.U. erred egregiously, he writes, in making draconian austerity policies the price of Greece\u2019s rescue while letting the continent\u2019s banks off scot free. The wrongness of this prescription, he says, is borne out today, five years later, with Greece prostrate under the burden of the E.U.\u2019s highest external debt (in relation to its economy\u2019s size), the highest unemployment (29\u202fpercent) and grim social and psychological fallout. Deep budget cuts and higher taxes have cost Greece a quarter of its pre-crisis wealth, rendering a recovery impossible, according to Galbraith, perhaps forever. Greece\u2019s withdrawal from the eurozone, he suggests, would have been preferable.Galbraith understands the eurocrisis largely as a byproduct of the global banking and financial disaster triggered in the United States in 2007, which the \u00adcenter-right governments in Germany and France exploited to crush the left-wing government in Greece and its allies elsewhere in southern Europe. Leftist governments, Galbraith says, won\u2019t get relief from the punishment of austerity, slashed wages, reduced pensions and the fire sale of state assets until their politics return to the center. Until then, they will suffer and the wealth disparity between northern and southern Europe will widen.Greece, Galbraith writes, could become something like \u201ca Caribbean dependency of the United States. Its professional population will continue to leave, and its working classes will also either emigrate or sink into destitution. Or perhaps they will fight.\u201dFighting, however, didn\u2019t get Syriza or Galbraith\u2019s friend, the controversial \u00adJanuary-to-June-2015 Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, very far. Even a national referendum rejecting the terms of a bailout didn\u2019t manage to dilute the poison the Greeks had to swallow. The way out, argues Galbraith, ever the Keynesian, is a multipronged approach that includes a spending program like the postwar Marshall Plan.For his part, Merritt presents the recipes of several research institutions, all of which call for rejuvenating the E.U.\u2019s structures to make them more democratic, flexible and efficient. He, like Galbraith and other E.U. advocates, insists that deeper political and economic integration is the answer. Yet, he concedes, because Europe\u2019s political spectrum is fractured as never before, with national interests regularly trumping common cause, the lesser evil at the moment may be smaller, tactical interventions to complete the single market, invest in research, modernize infrastructure and strengthen foreign policy mechanisms.Doing nothing at all is the worst option, the authors agree, a conclusion dramatically reinforced by the Brexit vote. That would condemn the E.U. to muddle from crisis to crisis until finally one of those crises takes it down once and for all.Paul Hockenos is a Berlin-based writer.

{"Headline": "Australia Allows Abuse of Refugees to Deter Others, Rights Groups Say", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 Asylum seekers and refugees being held on Nauru under Australia\u2019s harsh immigration laws are being deliberately subjected to suffering to deter others from trying to reach Australia, human rights researchers said after visiting the tiny island nation.\u201cThe Australian government is commissioning the abuse of these people,\u201d Anna Neistat, a senior director for research at Amnesty International who spent five days on Nauru in July, said by telephone from Paris on Wednesday. \u201cIt pays for the companies that detain the refugees, it pays for the guards, and it fails to provide adequate medical care. Australian taxpayers are funding it. And the world does not know this place exists.\u201dBetween them, the report said, the two spent 12 days interviewing 84 asylum seekers and refugees, including children, and spoke to service providers there. They said that asylum seekers were denied adequate medical care, that they were often the victims of crime and that depression and anxiety were rampant.\u201cAustralia\u2019s policy of exiling asylum seekers who arrive by boat is cruel in the extreme,\u201d Ms. Neistat said. \u201cFew other countries go to such lengths to deliberately inflict suffering on people seeking safety and freedom.\u201dMigrants intercepted at sea are instead sent to Nauru or to Manus Island, a part of Papua New Guinea, where they are held indefinitely. A few refugees have been resettled in third countries, including Cambodia, and many have been returned to the countries they fled. In April, the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea ruled that the detention center there was illegal.More than 1,000 refugees and asylum seekers, including around 50 children, are being held on Nauru. About 470 live on the grounds of the Australian-funded processing camp, while the rest live elsewhere on the impoverished island.According to the report, asylum seekers who live outside the camp reported that they were often the victims of violent crime, that women were threatened with sexual assault and that children were bullied at school. Refugees said they were anxious, depressed and unable to sleep. Children suffered from nightmares and some wet their beds; one 9-year-old boy, whose father had been suddenly transferred off the island for medical care, spoke openly of wanting to end his life, the report said.Ms. Neistat described the health care provided to asylum seekers as atrocious. Newborns had persistent infections, according to the report. One father said his son had kidney problems but had not been examined by a doctor. A man with diabetes lost 60 pounds and was told by medical employees that the weight loss was normal. One man whose wife gave birth at a clinic on Nauru told researchers that at one point she was lying under a bed that had no mattress, writhing in pain and receiving no help from staff.A spokeswoman for International Health and Medical Services, a company that Australia pays to provide medical services on Nauru, wrote in an email that the company \u201crefutes the claim that asylum seekers and refugees on Nauru are denied treatment by I.H.M.S. or receive poor quality treatment.\u201dPeter Young, a psychiatrist who worked for the company from 2011 to 2014 as the director of mental health services, said the report was consistent with his experiences on Nauru.\u201cI don\u2019t doubt the veracity of the allegations,\u201d Dr. Young said by telephone. \u201cI know there are people there with significant mental health issues. The government is pursuing a policy that makes these people human sacrifices to stop more boats from coming.\u201dSarah Hanson-Young, an Australian senator from the Greens party, said on Wednesday that she would introduce legislation that called for reporters and rights advocates to be given free access to Nauru.Australia\u2019s Department of Immigration and Border Protection said in a statement that it \u201crefutes many of the allegations in the report.\u201d Chris Gordon, corporate and public affairs manager at Broadspectrum, the company that the Australian government pays to provide services for asylum seekers and refugees on Nauru, said that it had \u201czero tolerance for abuse\u201d and that similar accusations had been raised in the past but not substantiated.Nauru, an island of eight square miles, was ravaged by decades of phosphate mining, and its economy is buoyed by payments and aid from the Australian government, which spent $314 million on its operations there last year, Amnesty said. The Refugee Action Coalition, based in Sydney, said the government spends about $900 million a year on the centers on Nauru and Manus Island.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Strong Job Gains, for Second Month, Reframe Economic Outlook", "Date": "2016-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe American jobs machine has moved back into high gear.After a long stretch of conflicting reports, the Labor Department said on Friday that the economy in July delivered a second consecutive month of robust hiring and rising wages in a signal that the expansion is strengthening, not ebbing, as it enters its eighth year.Stocks surged, experts expressed more confidence that the Federal Reserve was likely to raise interest rates before the end of the year, and it was clear that long-stagnant wages for ordinary workers were advancing at a healthier pace.\u201cThis was everything you could have asked for, maybe more,\u201d said Michelle Meyer, head of United States economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing new entrants into the labor market, which implies a longer runway for the business cycle.\u201dWith the political conventions completed, the buoyant jobs numbers also have major implications for the presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.Not only does the new data undercut Republican arguments that the recovery is faltering, it also suggests that after years of paltry gains, deeply frustrated workers are finally seeing some benefits from the drop in unemployment, which was unchanged last month at a relatively low 4.9 percent.Wages are up 2.6 percent over the last 12 months, a faster pace than earlier in the recovery, and many economists expect that the gain in incomes, adjusted for inflation, will accelerate later this year and into 2017.\u201cThe idea that Republicans are touting, that the job market is a wreck, is clearly belied by the data,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, an economist who served in the Obama administration. \u201cWhat matters most to people isn\u2019t G.D.P. growth, it\u2019s jobs and wages.\u201dLongtime G.O.P. economic hands like Wayne Berman, a veteran of several Republican presidential campaigns, conceded Friday\u2019s data was favorable for Democrats, but insisted it represented a snapshot of the economy, not necessarily the underlying trends. A major failing in the recovery, Republicans note, is that millions of Americans who dropped out of the work force during the recession have still not found jobs.July\u2019s jobs number \u201cis a good statistic for Clinton to pivot towards,\u201d said Mr. Berman, who currently serves as a top official at the Blackstone Group and advised Senator Marco Rubio of Florida during the Republican primary. He noted, however, that the economy grew at an annual rate of just 1 percent in the first half of 2016, a sharp decrease from last year.\u201cWe\u2019re in a very mixed economic picture now,\u201d said Mr. Berman, recalling the presidential campaign of Senator Bob Dole two decades ago, when attacks on Bill Clinton\u2019s economic record failed to resonate at a time of rising prosperity. \u201cYou can\u2019t say this is like 1996, when there was no oxygen for Bob Dole\u2019s arguments.\u201dThe July increase in payrolls stands in sharp contrast to data released just last week showing disappointing economic growth in April, May and June.A reason for the difference is that parts of the economy are still suffering from the continuing fallout from low oil prices as energy companies cut back on investment. Government spending also has been weak and many companies, at least for now, prefer to hire more workers rather than invest in new equipment and increase their efficiency and output.If business and government investment continue to lag, that could undermine the long-term ability of the American economy to be more productive and raise living standards for most workers.In late spring, the government reported that job creation in May was much weaker than economists had expected; a big rebound in June similarly caught the experts off guard. The July data helps clear up some of the confusion.\u201cThis is a validator,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays. \u201cThis is a report that indicates that the slowdown in hiring earlier in the year has been reversed.\u201dJune\u2019s gain was revised upward by 5,000 jobs, and May\u2019s by 13,000. The combination of better gains in the spring and July\u2019s increase in hiring means that the Federal Reserve is likely to have a more vigorous debate about raising interest rates when it meets in September. But most experts think the Fed will wait until December to be sure the economy remains on a solid track.The Fed said in July, after the most recent meeting of its policy-making committee, that the economy was growing more strongly and there were fewer clouds on the horizon, suggesting it was giving greater consideration to rate increases later this year.But on the policy-making front, William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and an influential adviser to Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, said on Sunday that current economic conditions still called for \u201ccaution in raising U.S. short-term interest rates.\u201dJob openings are spreading. \u201cIt\u2019s been a really good summer for hiring all across the country,\u201d said Tom Gimbel, chief executive of LaSalle Network, a recruiting and staffing firm based in Chicago. \u201cBusiness has been great. Kids coming out of college are getting hired, and we\u2019re seeing a lot of activity in the $50,000 to $150,000 category.\u201dThe upswing in jobs last month also coincided with a sharp drop in unemployment among the least-educated workers, a group that has missed out on nearly all the gains of the current recovery thus far.The broadest measure of unemployment calculated by the Labor Department, which includes workers who want full-time positions but cannot find them, stood at 9.7 percent in July.The payroll figures, which reflect hiring at companies and in the public sector, revealed broad-based job gains, not just in lower-paid sectors like retail and leisure and hospitality, but in high-paying fields like professional and business services as well.The household survey, which has offered a mixed picture in the past, was also robust.The jobless rate for high school dropouts, which has been elevated throughout the recovery, fell more than a full percentage point to 6.3 percent, suggesting that employers who had previously ignored these lower-skilled workers are now taking a second look.But a two-tier job market remains in place, with workers in the same region facing radically different conditions depending on their level of education and skills.In San Francisco, even the most junior software engineers hired at Sunverge, a maker of energy storage systems for solar electricity users, command starting salaries of just over $100,000.A little more than 60 miles to the east, at Sunverge\u2019s assembly plant in Stockton, Calif., where the unemployment rate is 9 percent, new blue-collar workers can expect to earn about $14 an hour, or $29,000 a year.Sunverge is bulking up in both cities. But hiring technical talent is much more time-consuming, said Stu Statman, Sunverge\u2019s chief of engineering.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s that hard to find good factory workers in Stockton,\u201d Mr. Statman said. \u201cIn San Francisco, if you\u2019re talking about software engineers or developers, it\u2019s very hard. It takes a long time, and there\u2019s a huge amount of hunger out there for people with these skills.\u201dBinyamin Appelbaum contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Australia Rejects Bids From Chinese Investors for Electricity Provider", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Citing national security concerns, the Australian government on Thursday rejected competing bids from Hong Kong and mainland Chinese groups for control of a company that supplies electricity to Sydney and neighboring areas.Key sectors of Australia\u2019s economy, like mining and agriculture, rely heavily on Chinese demand. But local wariness toward China\u2019s growing economic influence has risen in recent years amid a wave of Chinese takeovers of Australian businesses.At the same time, an influx of wealthy buyers from China has helped push up real estate prices in urban centers like Sydney and Melbourne, pricing local residents out of the market.In response, the Australian government, in accordance with its foreign investment review legislation, has been carefully vetting the sale of key assets to Chinese interests and has blocked several high-profile transactions. Officials have also ordered Chinese buyers to sell homes acquired in violation of Australia\u2019s restrictions on foreign investment in real estate.In the latest such action, the Australian treasurer, Scott Morrison, on Thursday rejected the bids for 50.4 percent of Ausgrid, an electricity provider with a 99-year lease to distribute power in the southeastern state of New South Wales.Mr. Morrison did not name the bidders, but news reports in Australia last month widely identified them as Cheung Kong Infrastructure, controlled by the family of the Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing; and the State Grid Corporation of China, a government-owned electricity transmission and distribution company that is China\u2019s biggest.\u201cThe national security concerns were not country-specific and relate to the transaction structure and the nature of the assets,\u201d he said.He said the bidders have until next Thursday to argue their cases before he makes a final ruling on the matter.Representatives of State Grid did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Cheung Kong Infrastructure noted that it had been operating power, water and gas networks in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand for 25 years.\u201cWe believe that the Australian government must have reasons beyond the obvious which led them to make today\u2019s announcement,\u201d the company said in a news release. \u201cThe issue is unrelated to CKI.\u201dAustralian news reports had estimated a sale of the Ausgrid stake could have brought in more than 10 billion Australian dollars, or $7.7 billion, to the state government of New South Wales.Both of the bidders are already significant investors in the Australian electricity market. State Grid has stakes in three local power companies, while Cheung Kong Infrastructure owns electricity and gas distribution networks in several Australian states.Australia has blocked several high-profile deals involving buyers from China in recent years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spain: A Country With No Government", "Date": "2016-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMADRID \u2014 On Jan. 2, 1492, Isabella of Castile and Ferdinand of Aragon \u2014 known as the Catholic Monarchs \u2014 occupied Granada, completing their conquest of Moorish Spain. Ever since, Spain has always had a government \u2014 and occasionally two, when Napoleon invaded in 1808, and during the 1936 to 1939 civil war that split it. But never during those more than five centuries was it ever without any. That is, until Dec. 20 last year, when elections failed to give any party the majority needed to form a government and all attempts at a coalition failed.For those of us accustomed to more direct suffrage, it is not easy to understand how democratic representation works in Spain. A Spaniard votes for \u201cdiputados,\u201d who elect the prime minister. With a parliamentary majority, the winning party proclaims its leader; without a majority, it needs to negotiate. This means that a voter may end up supporting positions he normally never would. Nowadays, for example, voting for the Socialist Party can mean a leftist coalition between the Socialists and Podemos, the anti-establishment party, or a center-right one among the Socialists, the center right Ciudadanos and Partido Popular; a vote for Ciudadanos may yield a right-wing alliance with the P.P. or a centrist one with the Socialists. In the parliamentary system the vote is a blank check But Spanish politicians cannot manage to rule even with that.Elections had to be repeated; the second attempt, on June 26, ended with very similar results, hence the continuing uncertainty. Negotiations carry on, without much hope. For exactly 253 days Spain has been unable to elect a new government and, as time goes by, more people wonder if it really is that serious.Obviously, a provisional, \u201ccaretaker\u201d government is in place; but it has limitations. For instance, it cannot appoint new ministers. From its original 13-member cabinet, 10 are left: Its minister of development is heading Congress, the minister of health is now a candidate for the local Parliament in the Basque Country, and the minister of industry is busy explaining his Panamanian bank accounts. The caretaker government has no authority to approve next year\u2019s budget, a basic tool for governing that should be in place this October; experts are poring over legal texts in search of a line that suggests authority. The government takes advantage, however, of the (most likely unconstitutional) opinion that acting government ministers are not subjected to parliamentary control. It has been nine months since Parliament enacted any laws: Its members are too busy campaigning and negotiating.These days, the \u201cmeanwhile\u201d government manages everyday matters, and not particularly well. In a situation that lacks clear legal status, no one wants to be in charge of important decisions, affairs are delayed and decisions are never made. The embassies in Washington, Moscow and Rome are among the 44 in the hands of diplomats who should have been replaced but can\u2019t be by a caretaker government. Examples abound.In everyday life, a country without government looks dangerously similar to another with one. There are those who praise the strength of the state for that, and many who wonder if governments are so necessary and seem uninterested in any attempt to form one. News coverage of these efforts does not get a significant readership.There are, nonetheless, a few who show their worries about a country without a functioning government. Jos\u00e9 Antonio \u00c1lvarez, C.E.O. of Santander, Spain\u2019s largest bank, stated a few days ago that lack of government \u201chasn\u2019t been noticed so far, but things can change if this goes on.\u201d For now, the economy stays on course: Spain\u2019s credit rating is strong, and the stock market is weathering Brexit better than others in Europe. In a world where finances are ruled from international centers, local governments seem to become less and less important. A majority of Spaniards are fed up with their politicians. Polls show that politicians are perceived as corrupt, selfish and increasingly incapable of solving the problems they should be concerned with. The idea is not new: It took shape mainly in the 2011 occupation of Madrid\u2019s Puerta del Sol, its main square, by the \u201cIndignados\u201d movement. Later, the idea was at the root of two new political parties, Podemos, supposedly the political left\u2019s renovator, and Ciudadanos, the counterpart of Podemos. Months of haggling and chatter have stripped away their aura of novelty; they became just two more parties, as entangled as any in the poker game of politics. If there is, after all, a third round of elections, forecasts signal historic levels of abstention and a radical rejection of a generation of politicians under suspicion. But they stick to their guns, apparently unable to understand the extent of the threat.Perhaps they are not fully to blame: The system seems broken. Parliamentary democracy worked efficiently for 35 years, in a bipartisan system with the Socialists and the Popular Party alternating in power. Now that four parties share the bulk of the vote, they are forced to negotiate, but they seem not to know how. Which may be good and bad: They do not betray much of their mandate, they don\u2019t get to govern.Lack of government is seen at times as a terrible menace, at others as a harmless situation. It will be useful if it manages to show that, in order to survive, the system must change. Otherwise, it will keep on being the butt of everyone\u2019s jokes \u2014 and the space where antipolitics will manage to establish new venues.Until now, the Spanish difference was that discontent had not yielded a right-wing, xenophobic and racist populism like the ones growing in many other countries; rather, it gave rise to two new parties to revitalize the democratic game. They are not doing it, and now anything can happen.This week Mariano Rajoy will try to be reinstated as a fully functional prime minister: His options are not clear. If he fails, his party will probably call for new elections to be held on Dec. 25. Among sea bream and nougat, cava and hangovers, the hope that the Christ Child or Santa will finally bring a government is an overstated mockery. Mr. Rajoy\u2019s \u201cpopulares\u201d are convinced that a low turnout in that cartoonish third election will favor them, and they are betting on it; as if the system\u2019s discredit still had room to grow without cracking. In my neighborhood, we call that spitting upward, and even an idiot knows better.Mart\u00edn Caparr\u00f3s is an Argentine journalist and writer based in Madrid.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For de Blasio, Another Grim Poll Offers Better News About 2017 Race", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA majority of New York City voters continue to disapprove of Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s job performance, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released on Monday, but he would still probably fare well in a matchup against at least two of his potential Democratic primary rivals.The telephone survey, of 1,310 New York voters, was conducted from July 21 to 28, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.7 percentage points.Maurice Carroll, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, said that the negative views of the mayor would be a serious handicap as he prepared to run for re-election in 2017, but that none of his possible challengers seemed poised to capitalize on that.\u201cHis positive numbers are lousy and yet on the horizon there\u2019s nothing bad,\u201d said Mr. Carroll, who added that opinions could change after the presidential election when voters began to focus on the mayoral race.The survey asked voters their opinions about two Democrats who might consider challenging Mr. de Blasio: Christine C. Quinn, the former City Council speaker whom Mr. de Blasio defeated in the 2013 primary, and the city comptroller, Scott M. Stringer.When registered Democrats were asked how they would vote in a primary election, 43 percent chose Mr. de Blasio, compared with 19 percent who chose Ms. Quinn and 16 percent for Mr. Stringer. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points when only Democrats were asked to respond.The results were somewhat closer when all voters in the poll were asked how they would cast ballots in a general election if Mr. de Blasio ran as the Democratic candidate, and either Ms. Quinn or Mr. Stringer ran as an independent. The poll showed Mr. de Blasio defeating both \u2014 43 percent to 33 percent for Ms. Quinn, and 45 percent to 32 percent for Mr. Stringer.The polled voters gave Mr. de Blasio negative scores for his handling of crime \u2014 with 49 percent disapproving and 42 percent approving \u2014 and police-community relations, with 55 percent holding a negative view compared with 37 percent positive.New Yorkers were split on his handling of relations between blacks and whites, with 45 percent approving and 44 percent disapproving.A mayoral spokesman, Austin Finan, said in an emailed statement: \u201cCrime is down, our economy is strong, affordable housing is being built, and more children are attending pre-K and graduating from high school than ever before. Mayor de Blasio has routinely delivered on the goals set by his administration and remains dogged in his pursuit to make this a fairer and more affordable city for every New Yorker. That\u2019s why he\u2019s the clear choice of Democratic voters, and that\u2019s why he\u2019ll be re-elected next year.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Signs of Trouble in Ukraine Prompt Question: What\u2019s Vladimir Putin Up To?", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe InterpreterWASHINGTON \u2014 Russia is conducting a series of military and rhetorical escalations toward Ukraine that have anxious Western analysts once again looking for clues as to President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s next move.Russia has increased its military presence in and around Crimea, adding to fears that Moscow might be planning another military intervention in Ukraine. But while Mr. Putin is nothing if not unpredictable, analysts say this may be about Russia seeking diplomatic leverage rather than prepping for war.There are two sets of overlapping events, both shrouded in mystery: the supposed recent attack on Crimea and Russia\u2019s buildup there.The official Russian account lays out the first as follows: It began late on Saturday, when F.S.B. officers discovered a group of saboteurs just on the Crimean side of the land border with Ukraine. A firefight ended with one F.S.B. officer killed and several of the saboteurs captured. Then on Monday, Ukrainian special forces attempted to cross into Crimea, killing one Russian soldier in what the agency called \u201cmassive firing\u201d over the border.Whatever happened, images found by open-source analysts suggest that Russia has been escalating its military presence in Crimea since at least Saturday \u2014 before the supposed attack occurred. These show convoys of heavy weapons moving on the peninsula, including missile systems intended for coastal defense.Some reports indicate that Russia\u2019s troops in Crimea were already scheduled for a new rotation about now, which would help explain the activity, though it would be quite a coincidence that this just happened to fall during some of the highest tensions since the 2014 annexation.Whatever transpired over the weekend, Mr. Putin has unquestionably escalated in his language toward Ukraine, choosing to use this episode \u2014 however real it was \u2014 for some larger aim.Analysts have pointed out disturbing parallels with how Russia behaved just before previous military actions against Ukraine.In February 2014, similar speeches and military maneuvers provided cover for Crimean volunteer militias to seize the peninsula, then still controlled by Ukraine, only to reveal they were in fact Russian special forces launching a military occupation.That August, as Russian-backed separatists lost ground in eastern Ukraine, Mr. Putin stationed troops along the border, warning they might be necessary to \u201cprotect\u201d ethnic Russian civilians in Ukraine who he said were under attack. He orchestrated an aid convoy into the region that, according to NATO, was mere cover for a Russian invasion force.Some have wondered whether Moscow might be plotting another intervention. Fighting has increased in eastern Ukraine, as it did before the August 2014 incursion.But that seeming parallel may be the point, meant to create fear of military action \u2014 rather than actual action \u2014 that will give Mr. Putin leverage with Ukraine and with Western countries.Mark Galeotti, a New York University professor who studies Russia, pointed out that Crimea would make little sense as a staging ground for military action against eastern Ukraine, which borders mainland Russia but not Crimea, and that the rest of the country is better defended.\u201cIt\u2019s highly unlikely that the Russians are truly planning some major offensive,\u201d Mr. Galeotti said. Rather, \u201cWe\u2019re looking at a classic Russian strategy of building up tension.\u201dInternational peace talks over Ukraine, once the mechanism by which Mr. Putin forced contact with Western leaders who had shunned him over annexing Crimea, have become increasingly regarded as fruitless and irrelevant.By dangling the threat of renewed conflict, Mr. Putin gives the talks a new purpose: to coax him back from the brink.\u201cIt\u2019s a standard Putin tactic \u2014 he wants to try to go there from a position of strength,\u201d Mr. Galeotti said of the next peace talks, planned for early September. \u201cAnd the only real strength is to say, \u2018I could make things much, much worse if I wanted to.\u2019 \u201dMr. Putin also said this week that it made little sense to continue negotiations amid the Crimea tensions, forcing the other parties to persuade him to come back to the table \u2014 and putting himself at the center of the process.It may also serve Mr. Putin\u2019s long-held hopes of a grand bargain with the United States that would settle their disputes over Ukraine and Syria \u2014 on terms favorable to Moscow, naturally \u2014 as well as ending Western sanctions against Russia.Mr. Putin has repeatedly hinted at this goal since his nation\u2019s economy began collapsing in late 2014, due mostly to the declining value of its oil and gas exports. Since intervening in Syria last fall, he has repeatedly invited Western powers to join him in a grand coalition to fight extremists.But Russian leaders may believe that they would need to secure such a deal before January, when President Obama will leave office. Russian officials tend to view Hillary Clinton as the likely successor and as more hostile to Moscow. Donald J. Trump, while conspicuously friendly toward Russia, is still seen as unpredictable.But Mr. Obama is seen as \u201clooking for resolutions, not conflicts,\u201d Mr. Galeotti said. \u201cSo there is a sense that there\u2019s a closing window of opportunity to get something done quickly.\u201dIn the meantime, should no grand bargain come, Mr. Putin appears happy to keep Russia\u2019s weaker neighbor guessing about what\u2019s coming next.The Interpreter column on Aug. 12, about signs of trouble in Ukraine that are making analysts wonder what President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is up to, misstated, at one point and in some editions, correct in other reference; fixed for later editions the year that Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine. It was 2014, not 2013.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Hillary Clinton Might Win Georgia", "Date": "2016-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBut this story has less to do with the future than the past, and both parties run a risk in misreading it. Mr. Trump\u2019s racially charged hard-right campaign reveals a fault line in Republican politics that dates from the very beginning of G.O.P. ascendancy in the South.The Republican\u2019s Southern Strategy is one of the most familiar stories in modern American history: Beginning in the 1960s, the party courted white racist voters who fled the Democratic Party because of its support for civil rights.But things were never quite so simple. Yes, racial reaction fed G.O.P. gains in the 1960s and \u201970s. And yes, Barry Goldwater called it \u201chunting where the ducks are.\u201dWhat did that mean? Goldwater\u2019s detractors understood it to mean that he was going after Dixiecrats, the Southern Democrats who had abandoned the party in 1948 over civil rights. Goldwater, however, maintained that he was going after college-educated white collar professionals who were building the modern Southern economy.That was the vision he described in his speech at the Georgia Republican Convention in May 1964. G.O.P. success in the South, he argued, stemmed from \u201cthe growth in business, the increase in per capita income and the rising confidence of the South in its own ability to expand industrially and commercially.\u201d Southern Republicanism, he said, was based on \u201ctruly progressive elements.\u201dGoldwater had a point. It was Southern businessmen who grew the party in the 1950s. Democrats, they said, were the party of corruption and cronyism. These Republicans even worked together with black Republicans, who since the 19th century had been the Southern G.O.P.\u2019s most loyal constituency.Yet there were never enough of these sorts of Republicans to put together electoral majorities in most Southern states. A notable exception was Virginia in 1969, where Linwood Holton, the father-in-law of the current Democratic vice-presidential candidate, Tim Kaine, put together a progressive Republican coalition to win the governorship. In almost every other case, however, the G.O.P. had to have the old Dixiecrats, too. And in May 1964, with Congress about to pass the most sweeping civil rights legislation since Reconstruction, thousands of white Southern Democrats were thinking the unthinkable and becoming Republicans.The scene played out dramatically at the Georgia Republican convention where Goldwater spoke. He left for California immediately after his speech and thus missed the political decimation of Georgia\u2019s Eisenhower Republicans. In a six-hour political rout, hard-line segregationists swept them out, along with longtime African-American leaders. \u201cWhat has been done here is to read the Negroes out of the Republican Party in Georgia,\u201d complained one high-ranking white official.The new order was symbolized perfectly later that campaign season when South Carolina\u2019s Democratic senator Strom Thurmond, the Dixiecrat presidential candidate in 1948, switched parties. Thus was established the political strategy in the South that Republican presidential candidates have followed ever since \u2014 melding an overtly conservative, socially moderate economic appeal aimed at the middle class with a politics of rage geared toward disaffected white voters.Richard M. Nixon pulled it off artfully in his two successful campaigns, appearing mostly in Southern cities and suburbs and letting Thurmond work the Deep South circuit. Ronald Reagan folded in religious conservatives in the 1980s to replace the generation of Dixiecrats dying off, thus consolidating the powerful mix of cultural reaction and economic conservatism that is modern Republicanism.Yet this year that mixture may not work. Mr. Trump\u2019s extreme language and divisive policies are alienating moderate Republicans in places like the Atlanta exurbs \u2014 where Mrs. Clinton is running nearly even with Mr. Trump. And across the state, polls show a significantly low number of Republicans saying they\u2019ll support their party\u2019s candidate.Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign most closely resembles the presidential campaigns of George C. Wallace, the arch-segregationist Alabama governor. Indeed, Wallace\u2019s legacy is telling. An economic progressive, he remained a Democrat his entire life. True, he galvanized white working-class disenchantment and pioneered a populist, anti-liberal rhetoric that Ronald Reagan and subsequent Republicans would use to devastating effect. Yet he never had much appeal among the new class of suburban whites; the two were like oil and water. So, too, it would seem, are Donald Trump and moderate Southern Republicans today.Whether or not Republicans hold on to Georgia and South Carolina this year, the lessons they are likely to take away are predictable. Democrats will assume that these states, like Virginia and North Carolina, are part of a long-term liberal trend and push traditional liberal ideas harder in future elections. Republicans will most likely write off Mr. Trump as a one-time phenomenon and not do anything. In doing so, both parties will ignore lessons from the history of the Southern conservative majority.What might be happening instead is something new in the South: true two-party politics, in which an urban liberal-moderate Democratic Party fights for votes in the increasingly multiethnic metropolitan South against an increasingly rural, nationalistic Republican Party. If that happens, it will transform not only the politics of the American South, but those of America itself.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Did Obama\u2019s Bill Fix Veterans\u2019 Health Care? Still Waiting.", "Date": "2016-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen President Obama signed a sweeping $15 billion bill to end delays at Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals two years ago, lawmakers standing with him applauded the legislation as a bold response that would finally break the logjam.It has not quite worked out that way.\u201cWe\u2019re making progress, yes,\u201d Senator Johnny Isakson, the Georgia Republican who is the chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, said in an interview. \u201cWhether it is enough is another question.\u201d\u201cVeterans who at times have struggled to get care at the V.A., you deserve better,\u201d he said.Even so, Robert McDonald, the secretary of veterans affairs, says the longer waits are because the care at veterans hospitals is getting better.Most veterans have other sources of health care, either a program like Medicare or private insurance, Mr. McDonald said in an interview, but they move to cheaper health care through the Department of Veterans Affairs if it is reasonably accessible. \u201cAs we have improved the care, what we have discovered across the country is more and more people want to come to the V.A.,\u201d he said.In some communities, the waiting problem is much worse. In July, veterans in Roseburg, Ore., waited twice as long to see a specialist than the average veteran. In Denver and Fayetteville, N.C., more than one-fifth of all patients must wait more than a month for appointments.Watchdog groups and federal audits suggest that it is hard to accurately assess progress because the agency\u2019s estimates are unreliable. Veterans say that staff members at the department still manipulate the books to make the next available appointment appear as the veteran\u2019s first choice \u2014 a trick that makes waits appear minimal even if they stretch for months.\u201cLong story short: It has major problems, not the least of which is the pure confusion that veterans and even V.A. employees have in working the program,\u201d said Garry Augustine, director of Disabled American Veterans.Veterans are required to call a private contractor to authorize and schedule appointments with private doctors, a process that veterans have said can take weeks. By the time a veteran sees a doctor, Mr. Augustine said, waits can be the same or longer than they would have been at a veterans hospital.If a private doctor decides a patient needs an additional scan or test that was not authorized for the visit, paperwork must go back to the department; that can add several more weeks.Also, many private doctors report waiting months to get reimbursed. \u201cWe are hearing doctors say they won\u2019t take part in the program because they aren\u2019t getting paid,\u201d said Representative Jeff Miller, the Florida Republican who is chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee. He added that the agency has $100 million in unpaid bills in his state.The agency says it is working to streamline its scheduling and payment process, while adding more doctors to cut waits.The agency says the losses are driven by improvement in the overall economy, but the report notes that 21 percent of departing employees said they left because of \u201cdissatisfaction with certain aspects of the work, such as concerns about management and obstacles to getting the work done.\u201dIt is unclear how many positions in the system are still unfilled. An agency spokeswoman said it cannot track vacancies for specific job categories.\u201cIf you don\u2019t have accountability, and you know your job is safe whether you perform or not, it\u2019s hard to make any progress,\u201d Mr. Isakson said. \u201cRight now, that is what we have at the V.A.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Poughkeepsie, a Convergence of Jazz Greats", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMusic | WestchesterWaryas Park is a scenic if slightly scruffy patch of green on the Hudson River in Poughkeepsie, a city that has had problems with a struggling economy over the years.But on Aug. 21, some of the world\u2019s leading jazz musicians will gather in the park for the annual Jazz in the Valley festival, which is expected to attract crowds from around the region and help burnish the city\u2019s image.\u201cThere\u2019s no question we have a bad perception problem to a lot of outsiders,\u201d Christopher Petsas, a councilman, said. \u201cBut I think slowly we\u2019re changing that. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important that we support this kind of event.\u201dThis year, the event\u2019s main stage will feature two other National Endowment masters: the pianist Randy Weston and the drummer Jimmy Cobb. Mr. Weston will lead his African Rhythms Trio, including Alex Blake on bass and Neil Clarke on drums. Mr. Cobb will play with Jazz By 5, an all-star group made up of Randy Brecker on trumpet, Javon Jackson on saxophone, George Cables on piano and Eddie Gomez on bass.These musicians do not plan to simply ad-lib a few choruses over the chord changes of popular standards. They will perform landmarks of the jazz idiom they helped originate.\u201cIt depends on the vibrations of the audience, my spirit and what kind of message I want to give through the music,\u201d he said.\u201cHe loves John Coltrane,\u201d Mr. Cobb said. \u201cHe says John is the only guy he ever dreamt about. Since he knows that I played with John Coltrane, we do a lot of those tunes.\u201dMr. Jackson, the festival\u2019s artistic director, said he works to strike a balance as he interprets music associated with venerated artists like Coltrane. \u201cThe spirit is strong in those recordings,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be coming through me. Hopefully, I can find a way of being me but still distilling the influence of my heroes.\u201dRounding out the program on the main stage will be the trombonist Craig Harris and the singers Chico Alvarez, with the Palomonte Afro-Cuban Big Band, and Charen\u00e9e Wade. A nearby pavilion will host lesser-known acts, among them the guitarist Slam Allen and the singer Stephanie Hancock, as well as the Dutchess County Community College Jazz Ensemble.\u201cWe encourage these things,\u201d he said.Ms. Smith pointed to the social and psychological benefits to the community, including the residents of the Rip Van Winkle housing project, which is perched on a hill above Waryas Park. While many of the housing project\u2019s young residents had little awareness of jazz history before visiting the festival, she said, they discovered a shared cultural heritage, as part of the African diaspora, with distinguished artists onstage.\u201cThat\u2019s the whole point,\u201d said Ms. Smith, the president of Transart and Cultural Services, a Kingston nonprofit that promotes art of African descent and is presenting the festival.But she said that keeping the festival afloat was a struggle. After foundation money dried up in the recession of 2008, she said, she curtailed forays of the musicians into local schools. With Poughkeepsie providing a small amount of money, grants from federal and state agencies supplied the bulk of the festival\u2019s financing while she tried to get a hearing from the local business elite.Supporters of the event like Mr. Petsas, a Poughkeepsie native, were investing their own time and money. In recent weeks, he has been pounding the pavement, soliciting help from small businesses. Along with the Exempt Firemen\u2019s Association, a social group, he had paid for a series of small jazz concerts in Donegan Park, in the city\u2019s Little Italy section, held on Saturdays leading up to the festival.Those concerts are a first, he said, adding that ultimately he would like the festival, which is scheduled for a Sunday, to expand to a full weekend. That, he said, could be a real engine for the economy, though the one-day event had already made a difference.\u201cIt has had a profound impact on the city of Poughkeepsie,\u201d he said, \u201con our image and on me personally.\u201dJazz in the Valley will take place on Aug. 21 at Waryas Park on the Poughkeepsie waterfront. Tickets: $60 on day of festival, less on advance sale; some events are free. Information: 845-384-6350 or jazzinthevalleyny.org.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turning Instagram Into a Radically Unfiltered Travel Guide", "Date": "2016-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyWhen I was a kid, \u201cQuantum Leap\u201d was one of my favorite TV shows. Its conceit was ludicrous, but in a way that allowed for maximum entertainment: A time-travel experiment gone awry forces the handsome Dr. Sam Beckett to \u201cleap\u201d among different bodies at various points in history. Each episode began with Beckett waking up in a new situation and piecing together the mystery of his surroundings. The show didn\u2019t shy away from serious themes: In one, he wakes up in the body of a woman who has just been raped; in another, he wakes up in the body of a black man in Alabama in the 1950s. \u201cQuantum Leap\u201d has stayed with me all these years, I think, because it offered my young, impressionable mind a framework for normal travel. Arriving in a new place \u2014 even if it\u2019s in the same dimension \u2014 can be disjointing and chaotic, because each new destination is governed by an invisible set of rules.Traditional guidebooks have never quite done it for me. Too often they seem to be aimed at a certain type of comfortable, middle-class traveler. And I happen to know intimately that the authors weren\u2019t always the most informed: One of my first paid writing jobs was for a travel-book company, where I penned florid prose about sea turtles in Costa Rica a full three years before I ever set foot in the country.The rise of the social web promised a new era of personalization for globe-trotting. But like many things born online, as popularity of the new tools increased, efficiency and usefulness began to decrease. Brands and businesses quickly set to figuring out how to manipulate and game the services, and they soon succeeded. Yelp, for example, lost credibility after it was revealed that businesses solicited people to write fake reviews. Foursquare\u2019s recommendations were initially a wealth of insider tips, but advertisers often bought their way into the recommendations, giving chains priority over local businesses. TripAdvisor has a slightly different problem: Its ambit is so broad that its recommendations have come to represent a safe median, a poll of polls. It\u2019s great for making sure a restaurant you want to eat in won\u2019t give you dysentery, but less so for identifying adventures or local secrets.Each of these shortcomings is different, but they amount to the same problem: These tools have come to replicate the biases and generic quality of the one-size-fits-all travel guides they were meant to replace. And as the vis\u00adual web matured, this problem seemed to be replicating itself yet again. Tourist boards flew popular Instagrammers to their idyllic locations and paid them to post impossibly stunning photographs to attract other world trekkers. Locations that may have once been hidden gems, like New Zealand\u2019s South Island, became hot spots \u2014 a boon for the local economy but bad for reliable reviews.But that same urge to share has created what is, for me, the best travel resource on the web: using location-based searches on social-media apps, especially Insta\u00adgram, to drop in, like Dr. Beckett, to different destinations. Looking at the raw feed of geotagged posts offers a graphic map in real time, which you can comb through to make your own guidebook. I like to think of it as akin to a surf cam. But instead of tuning in to see if the waves are too mushy, feeds give a feel for a place that you can use to decide if a place feels fun and seems safe \u2014 whatever that means to you. And this has become my compass, my way of navigating the world. Rather than obsessing over travel sites or print guides or bothering friends for recommendations, I check a new city or town\u2019s location tag right before I get there and see which recent posts are most popular. What I see there is wildly unfiltered, refracted through multiple perspectives \u2014 and much more revealing than any other guide.Before I went to Senegal in March, I spent two days watching the location tags for Gor\u00e9e Island, a landmark famous for its horrible history. It was there that captured Africans were imprisoned before being shipped to the Americas to be sold into slavery. The feed on the Gor\u00e9e Island location tag was cluttered with tourists\u2019 selfies. Worried that such cluelessness would ruin the experience and heighten the impact of the island\u2019s historical trauma, I decided to see the island some other time and have dinner with a friend and her family at their home instead.This approach also affords a window into cultural insights I might not get other\u00adwise. The year before, in Morocco, a group of friends and I were unsure how best to dress when walking around a small town outside Tangier \u2014 we wanted to be especially respectful because we were visiting during Ramadan \u2014 so we browsed local Instagram posts until we had a sense of what was appropriate. In Puerto Rico, I was eager to experience the Afro-Caribbean culture, so I scanned tags on Instagram until I sighted brown and black bodies in the location tag for Pi\u00f1ones, a beach outpost where families swim in the sea and vendors sell cold coconuts and alcapurrias, fritters stuffed with crab and cheese. It was one of the highlights of the trip.Just about any app with geolocation will do; each, in its own way, offers you direct access to locals and fellow travelers alike. While on an extended trip in Norway, and desperate for nonnative Norwegians to meet, I prowled and posted on Yik Yak in Oslo to try to figure out where young brown people hung out. In Cape Cod, I used Her \u2014 a dating app \u2014 to look into where young lesbians gathered in male-heavy Provincetown. These apps can also work in unexpected ways, specifically to avoid harm and danger: In Dakar, my friend and I received warnings via Grindr about inquiring openly about gay bars and hangouts, as homosexuality is still illegal in Senegal. A few months later, back home in New York, in an effort to safely celebrate Pride in the aftermath of the shootings in Orlando at Pulse, these real-time samplings were crucial for determining the temperature of gay events around the city.Lately, I\u2019ve been thinking about these off-label uses through another lens. In the early 20th century, segregation and racial hostility meant that traveling while black in America was an extremely dangerous affair. In 1936, a Harlem postal worker named Victor Green published a booklet called \u201cThe Negro Motorist Green Book,\u201d or just \u201cThe Green Book,\u201d comprising information he and other postal workers had gathered along their routes about establishments that would welcome black travelers. The book became less relevant by the mid-\u201960s, as the rise of the civil rights movement and the fight for equal access diminished the popularity of the Jim Crow staple.But even as laws and culture have changed, the rules are still not the same for everyone in America, or the world. The reality is that we all move through the world subject to subtly different forces and dynamics. As an adult venturing out, I\u2019ve come to figure out that adaptability requires assembling my own version of a Green Book, made in real time, generated almost accidentally by our collective need to share.An article on Aug 28 about user-generated websites referred incorrectly to fake reviews on Yelp. Businesses featured on the site \u2014 not Yelp itself \u2014 solicited the fake reviews.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Underwater in the Las Vegas Desert, Years After the Housing Crash", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "More than eight years after rotten loans and plunging home values made Las Vegas the center of the housing crisis, thousands of people have yet to recover.Supported byLAS VEGAS \u2014 Michael Hutchings bet it all when he built his 3,300-square-foot dream home on a strip of rock-strewn desert gazing west toward the Las Vegas Strip. He had made a fortune building custom homes as Vegas boomed higher and higher, and for his own, he chose red Spanish tiles, wrought iron and silky white plaster. A guesthouse? Sure. Swimming pool? Of course.That was 2006. You know what happened next. Today, more than eight years after the housing crash, Mr. Hutchings, 49, owes about $800,000 on a property that has not recovered its value from the bubble days. As neighbors lost their homes to foreclosure, he started to hear gunshots and see stray dogs roaming the streets here around Sunrise Mountain. A drug dealer moved in down the block. Over the protests of his wife, Terrisa, Mr. Hutchings now stashes an unloaded shotgun in the bedroom closet and a handgun in the kitchen cabinets, tucked beside the glassware.He could walk away from his mortgage and lose the $580,000 he has paid, or he can keep pouring his savings into the same hole. It is a mess with no good choices, he said, just like the presidential election. He will vote Republican, but Clinton or Trump \u2014 either way, it feels like a losing wager, he said.\u201cThe whole system\u2019s kind of broke,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to reinvent ourselves, trying to run businesses, trying to pretend like it\u2019s 2003 again. And it\u2019s not.\u201d\u201cI did blink,\u201d he said. But he still, warily, supports Mr. Trump. \u201cIt sort of puts a little bit of acid in the stomach,\u201d he said. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what this world\u2019s going to be like in 90 days. I have never been more confused about my country.\u201dLas Vegas is a glittering promise built on a simple truth: The house always wins. But years after rotten loans and plunging home values made Las Vegas the center of the housing crisis, thousands of people have yet to recover from the cataclysm that tipped the United States economy into a recession.Even with new resorts springing up on the Strip, home values recovering and record numbers of visitors pouring back to this American playground, thousands of people in golf-course mansions, gated condominiums and stucco starter homes are still stuck in 2008, battling with their banks, owing more than their homes are worth, trying to negotiate a sale to avoid foreclosure. To visit this underwater America is to take a tour of too-easy money, bad choices and worse luck, and of the way the economic toll of the Great Recession still haunts much of America.They blame themselves, but their scorn for banks and bailouts runs as wide and hot as the desert. The crash tarnished their faith in that core American belief that buying a house was a foolproof path to security and prosperity.Housing sales and prices are rebounding across Las Vegas, but the market was in such a deep pit that families who bought at the peak or borrowed against their homes say they may never see any return on their $240,000 starter home. Some who walked away are bouncing from rental to rental, negotiating bankruptcies and trying to fix their credit. And they say the tepid job market \u2014 Nevada\u2019s unemployment rate is 6.4 percent, up slightly in the most recent government survey \u2014 is an added weight.One afternoon, Maxim was speed-crawling across the sunset-colored kitchen tiles, and Natalia was changing from sundress to sundress and dancing with abandon. She sensed a move could be in the future, and was already making plans for where her dolls would go in her new room. Her mother, a choreographer from Australia, seemed ready to fight to stay. She and Mr. Hutchings had their wedding reception in the backyard.\u201cThis is something you don\u2019t walk away from,\u201d she said.Mr. Hutchings frowned.\u201cI\u2019m like, here\u2019s another payment walking out the door,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s another semester of college gone.\u201dHe stepped outside and glanced toward the glittering golden Wynn and Trump hotels, the fake New York skyline and onyx pyramid. There are a lot of troubled homes between here and there.Mr. Hutchings skimmed through the neighborhood\u2019s hodgepodge of upper-middle-class wealth and suburban decay. Manicured mansions border a Mormon temple at the foot of Frenchman Mountain. Down the hill, old horse pens are ringed with graffiti on a street where, Mr. Hutchings said, he once found shell casings. One minute, he seemed ready to give up. The next, he was determined to keep up the fight with his bank.\u201cThis is my last stand,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m like that old farmer who won\u2019t get off his property.\u201dAs he drove, he raved about \u201cPlutocrats,\u201d a book by Chrystia Freeland that critiques the rise of the superrich. He also reflected on the two times he had met Mr. Trump, at a Florida nightclub and a real estate event. \u201cJust a super cool guy,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing like he is on TV.\u201dIn a city whose skyline bears his name, many people have a Trump story. Mayor Carolyn G. Goodman said she had met him about 15 years ago when she and her husband, Oscar, then the mayor, made a pilgrimage to Trump Tower to discuss redeveloping 61 acres of old rail yards. Ms. Goodman said her husband had envisioned a kaleidoscope of architectural styles. Mr. Trump insisted on one look.\u201cI had such a headache when I left,\u201d Ms. Goodman said, sitting in her seventh-floor office. \u201cTwo bigger egos there are not.\u201d Downtown Las Vegas and the Strip spread from her window to the horizon. On her desk were photos of her with celebrities and politicians, including Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and the comedian Carrot Top.Ms. Goodman has rotated from Republican to Democrat to nonpartisan, and said the recovery had been too slow. Her calendar is full of meetings with investors from China and Australia with high-rise dreams. But one of her own sons is upside-down on his mortgage, she said. It all has left her uncertain of which candidate, if any, to support.Hillary?\u201cNo. Next question.\u201dTrump?\u201cNo.\u201dWell?\u201cI\u2019m really praying that between now and November there\u2019s some clarity, that somebody shows some leadership,\u201d she said.Leave the lofty office and drive north, to a quiet suburban street across from an elementary-school parking lot where Mark and Anna Lissor taught their son, and now their grandson, to ride a bike. The Lissors are hitting retirement age, but they owe about $500,000 on an overdue home-equity loan they used to remodel their house. They are hoping to negotiate a short sale for less than the value of their loan. It would spare them foreclosure, at least.\u201cI was so stupid,\u201d Ms. Lissor said. \u201cHow could I be so na\u00efve? I just didn\u2019t realize what was going to happen. Our balance was going up every month, every month. And then everything plummeted. And we were in the hole.\u201dThe Lissors are Republicans: He wears a \u201cOne Nation Under God\u201d T-shirt, and their car has a National Rifle Association sticker. Still, Ms. Lissor gives President Obama credit for creating programs that sought to keep people in their homes. But she said the bailouts had ended up favoring banks over typical homeowners. She sees Mrs. Clinton as a liar and a cog in a rigged system.As Shawn, their grandson, tumbled across the living room couch in a Captain America muscle outfit, Mr. Lissor walked into his study and pulled up the real estate listings for the neighborhood. A galaxy of blue dots filled the computer screen, each representing a house at some stage of the foreclosure process.\u201cThere\u2019s one down the street,\u201d he said. He clicked over to his home, a red dot up for sale to satisfy the bank. \u201cI don\u2019t care what they sell it for. I\u2019m getting nothing out of it.\u201dHead to the northern fringe of town, where waves of new homes run abruptly into an eternity of desert. The Jansons live here, in a peach-colored house they bought for about $290,000 at the height of the bubble. It was their dream home, with enough space for their growing and grown children and grandchildren, for the Christmases when they set up two trees and cooked for 20 relatives. They are trying desperately to hold on to it.\u201cIf Trump gets in there, we\u2019re in deep trouble,\u201d said Josephine Janson, 55.Last Christmas, her husband, Kevin Janson, 56, lost his $20-an-hour job as a security guard at MGM Grand and took a replacement gig at a downtown casino for $12 an hour. Ms. Janson was getting fewer and fewer hours at the jewelry counter at Kohl\u2019s. Then, in June, she was hospitalized with a severe potassium deficiency, and said she had lost her job the day she returned to work.The family started to strain to make $2,000 monthly payments on a loan that, even at the best of times, \u201cwas a little bit beyond our means,\u201d Mr. Janson said. As the house\u2019s value sank, they owed more than it might ever be worth. They spent $3,500 and countless hours to modify the loan and reduce the payments to a more manageable $1,500 a month. They have Mr. Janson\u2019s paycheck and his pension as a retired member of the Air Force.\u201cWe can probably do it, but just barely,\u201d Mr. Janson said.Many of their friends and neighbors sold at a loss or walked away from their homes, but the Jansons decided to stay. When he drives home from work every day at midnight, he skims past signs for sparkling new houses \u2014 Harmony Homes! The Preserve! \u2014 but the house is all the family has.\u201cWhat we have is what we\u2019re sitting in,\u201d Mr. Janson said.Their oldest daughter, Amanda Bumgardner, 29, was living at home with her three children as she waited for her husband to finish an Air Force tour in Arkansas. Last month, they moved to New Mexico. She is riveted to the news: of the presidential campaigns, the turmoil over race and policing. She keeps CNN playing like a night light as she and her children go to sleep.One afternoon, as he sat at the kitchen table, Mr. Janson expressed frustration that had been building for months. \u201cIt just seems like the harder you work, the more punctual you are, the more integrity you have \u2014 none of that matters anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cIt stinks. They brush us off like a crumb off the table.\u201dHe went upstairs, into the closet just off the bedroom where their 2-year-old grandson, Peyton, often curls up with them at night. Mr. Janson keeps a ham radio there, and when the children were growing up, he would tune the dials and bring them voices from Alaska, California, the Cook Islands in the South Pacific.As Ms. Bumgardner sifted through the children\u2019s clothes and princess dresses tucked in the closet, debating what to take with her to New Mexico and what to leave, Mr. Janson spun the tuning knob and threw out his handle: \u201cKC7ZOH, Las Vegas, Nevada, looking for any stations.\u201d He listened through the static, waiting for someone to answer.Advertisement"}

The house was built in 1970, with broad arches, rustic doors, stone floors and other distinctive style elements.The house sits on 0.7 acre and faces northwest, offering wide city views. The main entrance features a tall antique wooden door, which leads to a two-story reception hall. The walls are made with brick and mortar and coated with a mixture of lime and carpenter\u2019s glue as part of the Mediterranean look, the owner said.The living room and the main dining room have bleached, rustic wood floors. One of the home\u2019s special features is an iron chimney in the living room designed by the Peruvian artist V\u00edctor Delf\u00edn, which radiates heat throughout the house. Glass doors in the dining room and living room lead to the garden.The dining room was renovated in 1980 and features a chandelier and room for a piano. The furniture is not included in the sales price, but some pieces are negotiable, including the 12-foot-long dining table, the owner said.There are three bedrooms on the ground floor, including one with an en-suite bathroom. The other two bedrooms share a bathroom. The kitchen is off the entrance hall, and there is a separate laundry room next to the garage.The master bedroom is on the second floor, reached by a slim staircase off the entrance hall. There is an antique bathtub in the master bedroom\u2019s bathroom, which is surrounded by a circular wall and a glass roof. There is a covered terrace off the master bedroom with city views.There is also a guest room on the second floor with a bathroom and its own terrace, which can be reached by a staircase outside of the house. The garden is about 1,075 square feet and contains vines and trees that have been allowed to grow naturally on the hillside to attract birds, the owner said. There is also a vegetable garden.Santiago de Surco, also known simply as \u201cSurco,\u201d is one of the few areas in Lima with more single-family homes than apartment buildings, said Miguel Barragan, the owner of RE/MAX Royal, the Lima real estate company listing the property. \u201cIt\u2019s a great place for jogging, walking and cycling,\u201d he said. Several large shopping centers and neighborhoods with restaurants and night life are within a short drive of the house.The Jorge Ch\u00e1vez International Airport is about a 45-minute drive from the house.MARKET OVERVIEWSales in Lima have been slow for the last year, agents say. There is no official government data tracking real estate, but prices dropped as much as 30 percent in some neighborhoods after hitting a peak in 2014, said Nella Pinto, general manager and an owner of Peru Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.The higher end of the market has been particularly slow, after years of new construction, she said.Peru was one of the fastest-growing economies in Latin America from 2003 to 2013, according to the World Bank. Real estate prices almost doubled from 2009 to 2013, agents said.But political uncertainty, rising crime and a sluggish economy have weighed on the market. Economic growth fell to only 2.4 percent in 2014, with only a slight rebound to 3.3 percent in 2015, primarily because of a slowdown in the mining industry, according to the World Bank.Sales have already picked up in recent months, agents said. \u201cAlso, the prices are increasing and there will be no reduction on them this year,\u201d Mr. Barragan said.The waterfront neighborhood of Miraflores and the financial district of San Isidro are the most popular with buyers these days, according to agents. Prices in Miraflores average about $2,500 a square meter ($233 a square foot), compared with $2,900 a square meter ($270 a square foot) in San Isidro and $1,900 a square meter ($177 a square foot) in the much larger and more diverse Sucro, Mr. Barragan said.WHO BUYS IN LIMAPeru\u2019s fast-growing middle class was the main force behind the latest housing boom, agents said. The strongest demand is for homes under $100,000, according to Mr. Brace. There has been a drop in foreign buyers in the last two years, but Peru still attracts a wide variety of international companies, with employees looking to settle in Lima, particularly from China, Chile and Spain, Ms. Pinto said.Mr. Brace\u2019s clientele also includes retirees from the United States, Britain and Australia.BUYING BASICSSome of the mechanics of sales in Peru will be familiar to international buyers, agents said. There are no restrictions on foreign ownership of property, except near borders and military bases. And home prices are routinely listed in United States dollars.But many aspects of a purchase are different. A notary handles most of the mechanics of a sale, though agents encourage buyers to hire a lawyer to represent their interests. There is no traditional title process, making it difficult to track the legitimate owners, Mr. Brace said. Arranging financing is also very difficult for noncitizens, agents said.Sellers are usually represented by an agent, but exclusive listings are rare, making it difficult to determine the best contact for a given property. \u201cVery often 10 or more agents will have a listing,\u201d Mr. Brace said. \u201cWith some properties it can be very much a crapshoot who will end up selling it in the end.\u201d (This property is an exclusive listing, Mr. Barragan said.)With no official sales data available, prices can be all over the map, and final sales prices are often well below listing prices, agents said.WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCIESSpanish; nuevo sol (1 nuevo sol = $0.30)TAXES AND FEESBuyers must pay a transfer tax, known as alcabala, which is 3 percent of the final sales price. Notary fees, also paid by the buyer, usually total about $500 to $1,000, Mr. Brace said. Agent fees are usually 3 percent of the sales price and split between the buyer\u2019s and seller\u2019s agents, he said.The annual local property tax on this home is about $1,000, Mr. Barragan said. The capital gains tax on the sale of property for nonresidents can be as high as 30 percent, but there are exceptions that can lower it to 5 percent or less, agents said.CONTACTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Obama Years: The Best of Times to Be a Stock Investor", "Date": "2016-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesPresident Obama hasn\u2019t boasted much about the performance of the stock market during his time in office, but if he were inclined, he could do so with gusto.The facts are inescapable: The Obama years have been among the best of times to be a stock investor, going all the way back to the dawn of the 20th century.Consider that had you been prescient enough to buy shares of a low-cost stock index fund on Mr. Obama\u2019s first inauguration day, on Jan. 20, 2009, you would now have tripled your money. Stock market performance of this level has rarely been surpassed.Yet this performance has not been as widely celebrated or appreciated as past bull markets have been, nor is it a major issue in this year\u2019s presidential campaigns. The main reason may simply be that the current bull market is suspect because it came after one of the worst declines in stock market history.\u201cPoliticians almost seem embarrassed to talk about the stock market,\u201d said Paul Hickey, co-founder of the Bespoke Investment Group. \u201cIt\u2019s not a popular thing right now. But when you look at it, the record of the market under Obama is kind of incredible.\u201dBuying stock wasn\u2019t the obvious thing to do when Mr. Obama took office. The United States was still in the grips of the most severe economic downturn since the Great Depression, and the Dow Jones industrial average had already declined 34 percent over the previous 12 months \u2014 and it was still dropping.Yet the market performance record is first-rate.I asked Mr. Hickey to run the historical numbers, and he found that since 1900, the Obama presidency has so far been the third best for stock investors. Using the Dow Jones industrial average, market performance has been better only during the presidencies of Calvin Coolidge, a Republican, in the Roaring \u201920s; and Bill Clinton, a Democrat, from 1993 to early 2001, years that encompassed the tech bubble.The market under President Obama has risen 11.8 percent, on an annualized basis, without dividends. That compares with 25.5 percent for President Coolidge and 15.9 percent for President Clinton. It exceeds the Dow\u2019s performance for everyone else, including three Republicans who were known for being pro-business and for tenures that coincided with strong stock markets: Ronald Reagan, with 11.3 percent; Dwight D. Eisenhower, with 10.4 percent; and George H. W. Bush, with 9.7 percent.It\u2019s also noteworthy that since 1900, the market has performed better under Democrats, with a 6.7 percent annualized gain for the Dow, compared with a 3 percent gain under Republicans. Is it reasonable to conclude that Democratic presidents are better for stock investing than Republicans are? Probably not, especially with party alignments and policy positions in an extreme state of flux this year; even if this were true in the past, it may not be so in 2016 or in the future.Furthermore, if the direct impact of presidential policy on the economy is debatable, the effects on the stock market are even less clear. It is certainly difficult to demonstrate a strong cause and effect. But Mr. Hickey gave it a try: \u201cDemocrats spread the money around more than Republicans do, stimulating consumer spending, which is good for the economy and for the stock market,\u201d he said, but that this connection is hard to quantify conclusively.That said, there are two obvious reasons for the market\u2019s stellar performance in the Obama years.One is simply that, from a stock market standpoint, Mr. Obama had fortuitous timing. The market and the economy were already in such bad shape by the time he arrived in office that any signs of recovery were likely to result in a market rebound. Stocks did relatively well during much of Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s tenure, for example, partly because they had done so badly during Herbert Hoover\u2019s presidency at the start of the Great Depression.The chairwoman of the Federal Reserve has begun the process of raising interest rates, a move that her predecessors have taken in recent decades as they put their own distinctive stamp on the economy.The financial market research firm\u2019s survey of presidential elections and the stock market since 1900 concludes that (even though voters tend to tire of two-term presidents and their political parties) the kind of market we\u2019ve seen this year is, if anything, auspicious for the incumbent Democratic Party. \u201cThe stock market action so far this year is very much aligning up to support an incumbent party retaining the White House,\u201d said Ed Clissold, chief United States strategist for Ned Davis Research and a co-author of the note.The economy, which isn\u2019t strong, is at least not in recession, he said, and the Fed\u2019s monetary policy is expansionary, while fiscal policy is looser than it was during Mr. Obama\u2019s first term, which was bedeviled by the \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d budget impasse. He also cited this year\u2019s stock market pattern, which includes a correction \u2014 a decline of a little more than 10 percent \u2014 that ended in February, along with a smart recovery. All of that helps to tilt the odds in favor of an incumbent party victory, he said. A major market decline before the election could shift matters, however.This kind of tea leaf reading implies that the stock market is affecting the country\u2019s mood and political alignment, even if it\u2019s not being widely recognized. Investors may not give the president any credit for their portfolio returns. But the numbers are straightforward enough, and for those fortunate enough to hold stock, they are heartening: It\u2019s been a splendid market.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

They tried to scale the fence, scattering only when he raised and cocked his gun.Zimbabwe made international headlines when it started seizing white-owned farms in 2000. But Mr. Mutambara is not a white farmer. Far from it, he is a hero of this country\u2019s war of liberation who served as Zimbabwe\u2019s ambassador to three nations over two decades.\u201cWhen it was happening to the whites, we thought we were redressing colonial wrongs,\u201d said Mr. Mutambara, 64, who got his farm after it had been seized from a white farmer. \u201cBut now we realize it\u2019s also coming back to us. It\u2019s also haunting us.\u201d\u201cNo one is safe,\u201d said Temba Mliswa, 44, who was the chairman of the party\u2019s chapter in Mashonaland West Province before his expulsion from the party in 2014.Mr. Mliswa got a 2,000-acre farm belonging to a white Zimbabwean in 2005. When he took possession, Mr. Mliswa said, police officers beat the white farmer and his workers.But last year, Mr. Mliswa said, hundreds of youths sent by the party invaded the farm again, destroying property and beating his workers. They eventually left, but one of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s ministers recently held a rally in which he threatened to take Mr. Mliswa\u2019s farm unless he stopped criticizing the president\u2019s party.\u201cThey use the land to control you,\u201d Mr. Mliswa said.Zimbabwe\u2019s political uncertainty has weakened the economy, already hit hard by a severe drought and a fall in global commodity prices. People have been hoarding cash \u2014 Zimbabwe adopted the American dollar in 2009 \u2014 and taking it out of the country, leaving bank A.T.M.s empty.Mr. Mugabe\u2019s \u201cLook East\u201d campaign, which focused on attracting China as a counterweight to Western influence, has suffered from China\u2019s economic slowdown and recent disagreements over economic policy, though billboards still laud China as Zimbabwe\u2019s \u201call-weather friend.\u201dWith few other options left, Mr. Mugabe\u2019s government has turned to the International Monetary Fund, an organization he vilified in the past as an instrument of colonial domination.In talks with the fund, the government has agreed to reforms in the hope that it will qualify for loans for the first time since 1999. The fund has sent positive signals about government steps in areas like curbing the size of the public work force and cleaning up the banking sector.\u201cThe reforms are in our interest, and not in order to please anybody,\u201d said Patrick Chinamasa, the finance minister. \u201cWhether the I.M.F. is there or not, we have to do reforms in order to restore confidence in our economy.\u201dBut significant hurdles remain. The Zimbabwean government must clear $1.8 billion it owes to the I.M.F., the World Bank and the African Development Bank. It must also persuade the I.M.F., where a skeptical United States holds the most votes, that it is committed to change.And of all the potential reforms, perhaps none is as sensitive as land.Resolving the issue is central to reviving the country\u2019s economy and re-establishing ties, virtually frozen for nearly a generation, with Western governments.Zimbabwe has proposed establishing 99-year land leases. Currently, even black Zimbabweans who received land seized from white farmers lack land titles, leaving them at the mercy of the authorities.Under a program financed by the European Union and the United Nations, the government has begun mapping the more than 6,000 commercial farms that have been seized. For the first time, the government also recently held a workshop on the compensation of white farmers.\u201cA year and a half or two years ago, nobody really talked about it,\u201d Christian Beddies, the I.M.F. representative in Zimbabwe, said about land reform. \u201cSo if you look at it from that angle, what we are seeing is progress \u2014 really a general desire to address the issue.\u201dOthers are skeptical. Nginya Mungai Lenneiye, a former World Bank representative in Zimbabwe who has served in the government, said Zimbabwe might set up a \u201ccredible framework\u201d for eventual compensation that would satisfy the I.M.F.But actual compensation, he said, is another matter.\u201cIt cannot happen while Mugabe is alive,\u201d Mr. Lenneiye said. \u201cIt will be too much a slap in his face.\u201dBeyond pride, settling land ownership could strip Mr. Mugabe of an important tool he has wielded over the political class.Dozens are believed to be facing threats of losing their farms, according to former governing party members and the local news media.And for all the talk of compensating white farmers, politically connected Zimbabweans are continuing to grab white-owned farms.This year, a white Zimbabwean couple were expelled by police officers from their 2,000-acre tobacco farm. The new owner was a Zimbabwean doctor living in England; the news media uncovered photographs showing the doctor and his wife with Mrs. Mugabe.In 2000, two decades after Zimbabwe\u2019s independence, the country\u2019s best farmland remained in the hands of descendants of white settlers. Mr. Mugabe\u2019s government forcibly removed white Zimbabweans from their farms, which were supposed to be distributed equitably to black Zimbabweans.But high-ranking officials in the governing party received the best farms. Or, like Mr. Mutambara, the former ambassador, they were given the best tracts of a large farm, usually with the main farmhouse and farming equipment.\u201cContrary to what we had expected, some people because of their position in government have gone on to acquire multiple farms, huge farms,\u201d Mr. Mutambara said.Mr. Chinamasa, the finance minister, denied that some members of the political elite were violating the government\u2019s policy by owning more than a single farm. He said members of one family could each own a farm, creating the impression that they owned multiple farms.\u201cWe have a policy that it was one person, one piece of land,\u201d Mr. Chinamasa said. \u201cThe policy is clear. It\u2019s not a problem.\u201dBut if Mr. Mugabe\u2019s government can reward loyalists with prime land, it can also easily take it back, especially with the lack of deeds or long-term leases.Mr. Mliswa said he had received his farm when his uncle headed the lands ministry. Once considered Mr. Mugabe\u2019s right-hand man, the uncle was also expelled from the governing party in 2014 and now risks losing his farm, too, Mr. Mliswa said.\u201cThere was blood spilt on my farm, there was violence, which I really, really, really, really regret,\u201d he said of the seizure of his farm from its white owner in 2005. \u201cI apologize profusely, but it was because of the system I was involved in. I belonged to a party whose culture is violence.\u201dHopewell Chin\u2019ono contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Gilded Olympics Begin With the Opening Ceremony in Gritty Rio", "Date": "2016-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by20 PhotosRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 If there was a nation in need of an uplifting spectacle at this moment, even in the form of a public relations exercise, it was Brazil.The first South American country to host the Olympics is reeling from an astonishing combination of political upheaval and economic crisis. Its efforts to stage the world\u2019s biggest sporting event met trouble at every turn, from the Zika virus to polluted waters to budget cuts so deep that basic operations became strained.So the opening ceremony of the Summer Games arrived Friday night as a salve, disguising the wounds for a few hours and letting Brazilians celebrate everything from the waves of immigrants still putting down stakes here to Alberto Santos-Dumont, the aristocratic bon vivant whom Brazilians credit with inventing the airplane.Over the past several Olympic cycles, the gigantic cost of hosting the Games has drawn as much attention as the athletic performances. Host countries like China and Russia have used the Olympics as a show of force. The vibe, and the budget, are different here. These are a no-frills, budget-conscious Olympics \u2014 even if the opening ceremony dazzled.\u201cThe show was magnificent, its portrayal of Brazil\u2019s history through images and movement,\u201d said Lu\u00eds Gustavo da Silva Teixeira, 24, a worker at a car factory who watched the ceremony at a cafe in Rio. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s something my children will witness again in this country of ours so I feel fortunate.\u201dThe organizers of the ceremony even chose a word in Portuguese, gambiarra, to describe their own efforts to put on a show amid Rio\u2019s pared-down Olympic ambitions. Translating the word, which is pronounced GAHM-beeah-hah, poses its own challenges, so they offered a few options: jury-rig, quick fix, do a MacGyver.Unpredictability marked even the lighting of Olympic caldron. The soccer legend Pel\u00e9 was thought to be a likely candidate until Vanderlei Cordeiro de Lima, who was leading the marathon at the 2004 Athens Games when he was tackled by a spectator, carried out the honor.The Games have also been marred by scandal emanating from half a world away: nearly a third of Russia\u2019s Olympic delegation was barred from the Rio Olympics after revelations emerged of a state-sponsored doping program. More than 100 Russian athletes had failed to earn the approval of the International Olympic Committee.Extolling achievements like Rio\u2019s pioneering replanting of its urban forests and the tolerance, however fragile, that characterizes much of Brazilian society, a message emanated from the opening ceremony: Some order and progress, the words optimistically emblazoned on the country\u2019s flag, might just emerge from the creative chaos that persists here.Political leaders certainly hope that the Olympics will be a turning point in the fortunes of Brazil and Rio, whose quest to host the Olympics began in the early 1990s \u2014 a time when the city was wallowing in crisis, enduring a long decline after authorities built Bras\u00edlia, the new capital, from scratch deep in the country\u2019s interior and transferred much of the federal bureaucracy there in the 1960s.Still, the I.O.C. frequently frustrated Rio\u2019s ambitions. It was only in 2009, when Brazil\u2019s star was on the rise as its economy prospered from a commodities boom, that Rio was finally awarded the Games. Elated crowds celebrated on Copacabana.\u201cI\u2019ve never felt more pride in Brazil,\u201d Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, the country\u2019s president at the time, said when Rio got the Games. \u201cNow, we are going to show the world we can be a great country.\u201dBut much has changed since that exuberant day. Brazil\u2019s economy is mired in its worst recession in decades. Rio is grappling with a resurgence of violent crime. And colossal corruption scandals are casting a pall over the nation\u2019s political establishment.The city\u2019s preparations for the Olympics were marked by a long string of fiascos, including the recent collapse of an oceanfront bicycle path that killed two men. Mr. da Silva, universally known as Lula, did not even attend the opening ceremony \u2014 he is instead preparing for a trial on charges that he tried to obstruct an inquiry into a massive bribery scheme at Petrobras, the national oil company.Mr. da Silva\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9e and successor, Dilma Rousseff, who was suspended as president to face an impeachment trial, also skipped the show. Instead, it was the interim president, Michel Temer \u2014 who had emerged victorious in a power struggle in May \u2014 in attendance.A loud chorus of boos greeted Mr. Temer in the Maracan\u00e3 stadium when he spoke briefly to officially declare the start of the Games.Without delving explicitly into politics, the ceremony explored Brazil\u2019s complex history, including its settling by indigenous peoples, its colonization by Portuguese explorers and the tragic scope of the country\u2019s slave trade.Rio, a city without a major slavery museum, is still grappling with how to discuss the ways the slave trade affected its development \u2014 even though it received more than 1.8 million African slaves. Rio alone accounted for about 21.5 percent of all slaves who landed in the Western Hemisphere.\u201cThey need to understand what empathy is,\u201d said Ms. Conka, 29, who is from the southern city of Curitiba. \u201cThe current political moment in Brazil is just unpleasant. Slavery might not exist anymore, but blacks in our society are still undervalued and attacked on social media. The only way to help the new generation is with education.\u201dReflecting, perhaps, the resilience of freedom of expression in Brazil\u2019s unruly democracy, some observers voiced displeasure over the lavish ceremony.Let\u00edcia Bahia, a psychologist and feminist commentator, questioned the prominence given to Gisele B\u00fcndchen, the Brazilian supermodel, who cat-walked to the song \u201cThe Girl from Ipanema.\u201d\u201cWhat does it say about a mixed-race country, boasting about its pride over miscegenation, to choose a supermodel who is white, ultraskinny, blond and blue-eyed to represent the women of Brazil?\u201d Ms. Bahia said.Various stunning musical performances marked the extravaganza, with a new generation of performers like MC Soffia, a 12-year-old rapper from S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s hardscrabble periphery joining giants of Brazilian music like Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil. Anitta, a performer mixing samba, funk and global pop with a nod to artists like Beyonc\u00e9, danced along with them.In one of the more thrilling moments, dancers representing the Bate-Bolas, a raucous Carnival tradition in Rio, enacted a clash with dancers representing Maracatu, a Carnival tradition from the northeastern state of Pernambuco.On a more cerebral note, the actors Fernanda Montenegro and Judi Dench read from \u201cNausea and the Flower,\u201d a 1945 poem by Carlos Drummond de Andrade, in which the poet complained: \u201cIt\u2019s still a time of feces, bad poems, hallucinations, and waiting.\u201dAnd yet, the poet manages to find hope in a flower sprouting through the asphalt.Building on that thought, the ceremony issued a call to action to combat global warming, putting forward the strategy of reforestation to capture carbon. Curiously absent from all of this was any mention of Petrobras, one of the world\u2019s largest petroleum concerns.Its huge oil discoveries turbocharged Brazil\u2019s economy, enabling the country to project clout when it was awarded the Olympics. Now Petrobras, a major emitter of greenhouse gases, is mired in scandal following revelations that Brazil\u2019s leaders used the energy behemoth to fund political campaigns.On Saturday, the Games begin in earnest. Will the athletes fully command the spotlight, or will the host country\u2019s nagging problems mount? The world is watching.Paula Moura contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Secret of Jamaica\u2019s Runners", "Date": "2016-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionCAMBRIDGE, Mass. \u2014 Among the most enigmatic features of Jamaica, an island of only 2.8 million people, is its astonishing supremacy in running. Currently, the world\u2019s fastest man and woman are both Jamaicans. Nineteen of the 26 fastest times ever recorded in 100 meter races were by Jamaicans. The list goes on.How do Jamaicans do it? It\u2019s not because of genetics, as some claim. A vast majority of Jamaicans\u2019 ancestors are from West Africa, which has relatively few outstanding sprinters. Nor can genetics explain why Jamaicans outperform other blacks in the Americas, especially in Brazil, which has 36 times as many of them.Ask a Jamaican like me (I was born and raised there), and we\u2019ll give you a very different answer: Champs. Officially called the Inter-Secondary Schools Sports Association Boys and Girls Athletics Championship, Champs is an annual competition attended by 30,000 wildly enthusiastic fans. Jamaica is perhaps the only country in the world where a track and field meet is the premier sporting event.But it\u2019s not just Champs. The competition is one part of a broader framework \u2014 track and field is huge at every educational level, with periodic regional meets drawing athletes of all ages from the most remote rural areas. So the real question is, why is Jamaica nuts for track?Part of the answer is institutional. The British first introduced organized and informal athletics, and interscholastic competition, to Jamaica and other colonies in the late 19th century. One of Jamaica\u2019s founding fathers, N. W. Manley, was the greatest student athlete of his generation; later, as the revered head of state, he tirelessly promoted track and field.Jamaica quickly stood out from other Caribbean islands in extending these competitions from elite white schools to those of the nonwhite classes. Starting early in the 20th century, several outstanding athletes, like G. C. Foster, emerged as role models, mentors and promoters of the sport, and they identified and trained the next generation of talent.By the time I went to high school, in the \u201950s, track and field was as popular among my friends as baseball was among kids my age in Brooklyn. My heroes were the runners who had triumphed at Helsinki. Noel A. White, one of our country\u2019s most revered coaches, joined Foster to coach my high school to Champs victory in 1957. White was also my homeroom and history teacher, and he coached me after school, free of charge, to the top of my graduating class and a university scholarship.But the institution is only part of the answer. These efforts succeeded because of an abundance of very healthy children and young people \u2014 the result not of Jamaica\u2019s mountainous terrain, as some have claimed, but of the extraordinary success of a public health campaign partly spearheaded in the 1920s by specialists from the Rockefeller Foundation.The program began in the small town of May Pen, where I later grew up. It emphasized hygiene, clean water and fecal and mosquito control. The old mantras \u201chealthy bodies, healthy minds\u201d and \u201ccleanliness is next to godliness\u201d took hold in our communities and primary schools, whose teachers were recruited in the public health campaign. Running, as the cheapest sport, was the natural beneficiary of this movement. As a child, Usain Bolt received his initial training at a remote, poorly equipped rural grade school.The result was what the historical demographer James Riley calls the Jamaican paradox: one of the rare instances of a poor country with the life expectancy of an advanced society, a health transition that began in the 1920s and improved at one of the fastest paces on record, from 36 years at birth in 1920 to 70 by 1977. It\u2019s no accident that the oldest individual medalist in Olympic track history is a Jamaican woman, Merlene Ottey, who was still sprinting in international meets at age 52.Yet another factor is Jamaicans\u2019 combative individualism, the dark side of which is the country\u2019s chronic violence. Its bright side, though, is extreme self-reliance \u2014 which, along with effective health policy, is Riley\u2019s main explanation for the life-expectancy paradox. But it also dovetails nicely with running, in which performance is entirely up to the athlete. Jamaican track is a far cry from the British ethic of winning with grace. One Olympic medalist and alumnus of one of the dominant schools at Champs was quoted by the writer Richard Moore as telling young athletes: \u201cOne thing we go out there for, and that\u2019s to win. To win. To win. To win. To win. To dominate. To crush them!\u201dThe world got a taste of Jamaica\u2019s cutthroat track culture in Beijing, where Bolt, on the verge of winning the 100 meters in record time, slowed down, thumped his chest and spread his arms in a taunting, triumphant gesture. \u201cWe are a confident people,\u201d he later told the BBC.This self-assuredness can lead to reckless behavior. Although Bolt has a clean slate, several Jamaican athletes have tested positive for prohibited substances. Some are no doubt guilty, and the recent disclosure that Nesta Carter tested positive for a banned substance as a result of a retest of samples from Beijing has caused consternation in Jamaica \u2014 though, to be fair, the Swiss-based Court of Arbitration for Sport has overturned or reduced penalties imposed on Jamaican runners on the grounds that there were nondoping explanations for the results. (Jamaicans have a long tradition of taking herbal supplements to promote good health.)Jamaica has also creatively exploited its proximity to the United States. Some of our best runners went to college there on athletic scholarships, and they stayed and even competed for America, as many now do for Britain and Canada. But a critical number of them, like the world-record holders Dennis Johnson and Herb McKenley, who was also an Olympic medalist and a former Jamaican national coach, returned to train generations of new stars. Jamaican student athletes also acquired international experience by participating in American meets like the annual Penn Relays, where they frequently excel.Until recently, Jamaican athletes who didn\u2019t get scholarships or coaching jobs tended to leave the sport after high school. But even that is changing. Beginning nearly 20 years ago, Jamaicans started establishing for-profit track and field clubs, which have brought American-style sports entrepreneurship to the island. Now nearly all the island\u2019s major track stars are being trained locally, greatly reducing the talent drain and shifting the focus to adult runners, lengthening their careers and, with their greater local visibility and wealth, intensifying the island\u2019s passion for the sport.The remarkable success of Jamaicans in building the institutions of a globally dominant sports enterprise and a complementary system of public health is a positive story, but it raises another question: Why have they failed so badly in developing a successful economy?The answer is complex and incomplete. But it might lie in a deeper truth about the island. Political and economic successes are often top-down, relying on leadership that adapts and manages appropriate institutions that also benefit the non-elite. But things like health reform and sports success \u2014 and the reggae industry, for that matter \u2014 are largely bottom-up. Jamaica is yet to acquire the leadership for national development it deserves.

{"Headline": "Greek Crisis, the Book. Or Actually Several of Them.", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn May last year, James K. Galbraith, a left-leaning American economist, sent an email to Greece\u2019s finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, in which he argued that an exit from the eurozone would benefit Greece.Mr. Galbraith, who was advising Mr. Varoufakis at the time, made the case that a new currency would wash away the country\u2019s debts, solve Greece\u2019s competitiveness problem and ultimately create what he called a \u201cgood society.\u201d Though the step was opposed by most Greeks, he had drawn up a contingency plan for Greece under Mr. Varoufakis\u2019s direction, in the event the country was forced to leave the currency zone by its creditors.In the end, there was not a so-called Grexit. One year ago this month, after the polarizing finance minister left his post, Greece agreed to its third bailout with Europe, accepting yet another round of brutal austerity measures as the price for a new round of loans.A starry-eyed embrace of all that Mr. Varoufakis said and did, the book also highlights the extent to which unorthodox, if not unrealistic, economic thinking reached the highest levels of the Greek government as it battled with its creditors last summer.As the anniversary of Greece\u2019s bailout deal approaches, there have been several memoirs, essays, a blistering critique of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s policies in Europe and even a book of poetry that, from various perspectives, examine Greece\u2019s torturous struggle to avoid bankruptcy.And as the negotiations between Greece and its creditors slowly press on, these works serve as a reminder that an agreement allowing Greece to pay off its debts without strangling its economy is unlikely to be reached any time soon.\u201cThere is a fog-of-war atmosphere here that inhibits good policy making,\u201d said Paul Blustein, a former Washington Post reporter and the author of \u201cLaid Low: Inside the Crisis that Overwhelmed Europe and the I.M.F.,\u201d which will be out in October. \u201cBut there are no villains \u2014 just people fighting their corner and kicking the can down the road.\u201dBesides Mr. Galbraith\u2019s work, Mr. Varoufakis and George Papaconstantinou, the finance minister during the saga\u2019s early days, have come out with books. Nick Papandreou, the brother of former prime minister George Papandreou, has written a searing personal essay about the Greek press attacking his family. And a collection of poems, \u201cAusterity Measures,\u201d examines the crisis.The report reveals how I.M.F. staff members operated outside official channels, kept sensitive papers in personal files, withheld crucial documents from the watchdog agency and did not keep the fund\u2019s board fully informed during the crisis.The secrecy was such, I.M.F. board members said, that at times they learned more of what was going on in Greece from media reports than their own staff.The I.M.F. has a mandate to serve as an objective lender of last resort to troubled economies. The report by the watchdog agency, which also examines the crises in Ireland and Portugal, highlights just how difficult it was for the fund to fulfill its mission in developed Europe as opposed to the emerging world where it usually operates.I.M.F. economists did not foresee the crisis in Europe \u2014 from bank blowups in Spain and Ireland to sovereign bankruptcy in Greece \u2014 because of \u201cgroupthink and intellectual capture,\u201d the report said.The I.M.F., after all, has always been run by a European, and many of its top executives, hailing from Italy, Spain, France and Portugal, had complete trust in the sanctity and strength of the euro.It was not until mid-2010, the watchdog points out, when the Greek crisis was in full swing, that I.M.F. economists first accepted that excessive borrowing by smaller countries using the euro \u2014 Greece and Ireland \u2014 could have a destabilizing effect on the currency zone.Time and again, the review highlights this unwillingness of the fund to challenge European officials as a persistent flaw in its policies, leading to its highly controversial decision to lend money to Greece in 2010, even though economists at the fund believed that the near-bankrupt country had little chance of paying the money back.In blunt language, Susan Schadler, a former top official at the I.M.F., writes that the I.M.F. was too easily swayed by European officials who argued that not lending to Greece, or requiring it to restructure its debt, would create a systemic panic in the markets.In a response to the watchdog agency\u2019s report, Christine Lagarde, the managing director of I.M.F., called the fund\u2019s involvement in Europe a qualified success. She said Greece\u2019s problems were unique and that the bottom line was that the country had remained in the euro.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.But Ms. Schadler has a different view, seeing the decision and the secretive way it was handled as damaging to the fund\u2019s reputation.\u201cBy not following an open, transparent process, the fund created the perception that a decision made in Europe had been imposed on it,\u201d she wrote in her paper.A self-published memoir by George Papaconstantinou, the Greek finance minister at the time, looks at why the I.M.F. had to lend to Greece in the first place in 2010.One tends to forget just how absurd Greek finances were when he took over.One example: The Greek Finance Ministry spent 35,000 euros a month on buying newspapers alone.And there are some juicy vignettes, such as a warning from Jean-Claude Trichet, then the head of the European Central Bank, that a restructuring of Greek debt would have the same effect on global markets as allowing Lehman Brothers to fail.Mr. Papandreou\u2019s essay, \u201cTaming the Dogs of War,\u201d which he presented in April at a conference on media pressures from business and government, covers some similar ground.He recounts how the newspapers in Greece, which are controlled by powerful businessmen, attacked him as well as his brother, the former prime minister, accusing him of hoarding money overseas and driving him to the brink of suicide.For the many who are waiting for his promised tell-all about his experiences battling with European and I.M.F. officials over Greece\u2019s debt, this is not that book.Fans of Mr. Varoufakis will lap up his fiery criticisms of European and American economic policy making, but other readers will prefer to wait until next summer when his blow-by-blow account is scheduled to be published.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazil\u2019s Senate Votes to Move Ahead With Dilma Rousseff\u2019s Trial", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter hours of debate in the capital, Bras\u00edlia, senators voted 59 to 21 on Wednesday to indict Ms. Rousseff on charges of budgetary manipulation, formally making her a defendant. The trial in the Senate, which will be overseen by the chief justice of the Supreme Court, is expected to take place this month.\u201cIt marks the final phase,\u201d said Ivar Hartmann, a law professor at Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Getulio Vargas in Rio de Janeiro.Although only a simple majority was needed in Wednesday\u2019s vote, the number of senators who went against Ms. Rousseff exceeded the two-thirds needed to oust her permanently when a final vote is held after the trial, a sign that she faces long odds of surviving.The impeachment proceedings, which have consumed most of the year, became politically tenable after Ms. Rousseff\u2019s popularity plummeted. Her sagging political fortunes came to embody widespread public anger over systemic corruption and a battered economy, largely a result of policies she enacted during her first term.The proceedings have also deepened polarization in the country: Brazilians protesting against impeachment were removed from some sporting events during the initial days of the Olympics.In Brazil, the president is suspended at that point \u201cso that the investigation can continue unimpeded by her,\u201d said Daniel Vargas, a law professor at Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Getulio Vargas.Wednesday\u2019s vote by the full Senate means that the \u201caccusations against her were accepted,\u201d including a request for conviction, said Ronaldo Porto Macedo Jr., a law professor at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo and other institutions.Brazil is in the midst of its deepest political crisis in decades, with its president facing impeachment proceedings and many in Congress facing criminal or corruption charges.Another difference in the latest vote was that the chief justice of the Supreme Court, Ricardo Lewandowski, presided over it. He could have thrown out the charges, saying that they lacked minimum grounds to continue, according to Professor Macedo.Next comes the final trial, during which the Senate will invert its role from prosecutor to jury. Ms. Rousseff has been accused of manipulating the federal budget to conceal mounting economic problems, although, unlike many of the political figures who have orchestrated her ouster, she has not been accused of illicit personal enrichment.\u201cFormally speaking, Dilma becomes a defendant as of today,\u201d Professor Vargas said.Neither side, though, is unblemished. What is clear is that impeachment has been a highly political process and, effectively, a power struggle, with valid doubts about its legitimacy and motives.Mr. Calheiros, a highly malleable politician who was until recently an ally of Ms. Rousseff but is now a key supporter of Mr. Temer, has also been pushing measures seen as weakening the corruption investigation, raising concerns among federal prosecutors.The lead prosecutor in the inquiry, Deltan Dallagnol said in a recent interview, \u201cWe don\u2019t have any doubt that the objective of these proposals is to silence the investigation.\u201dAll of this has made many people question whether Ms. Rousseff is getting a fair look by members of Congress. The skeptics include the head of the Organization of American States, who criticized the process in April.The Brazilian diplomat Paulo S\u00e9rgio Pinheiro, a former member of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, said of impeachment, \u201cThe legal grounds are completely unconvincing.\u201dIf Ms. Rousseff is impeached, \u201cthis will be tragic,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be tragic for Brazil, but it will also be tragic for our continent.\u201dStill, Ms. Rousseff\u2019s moves since being suspended do not seem to be doing her any favors. She has recently quarreled with members of her own party, with whom she has a tense relationship.In Wednesday\u2019s vote, she also lost the crucial support of a senator from the governing Brazilian Democratic Movement Party who had previously voted against the impeachment process after an all-night debate in May.Advertisement"}

The main opposition candidate, a wealthy businessman, Hakainde Hichilema, won 47.67 percent of the total.Commission officials had initially said that they would release final results by early Sunday, but the vote tallying took longer because of an unexpectedly large turnout. Mr. Hichilema\u2019s party, the United Party for National Development, attributed the delay to Zambia\u2019s electoral commission, accusing it of vote rigging.In a news conference on Sunday, as incomplete results showed he was trailing behind the president, Mr. Hichilema cited irregularities in the count in Lusaka, the capital, and demanded a recount.\u201cThe question is, will the elections be defined as free and fair, transparent and credible in this environment?\u201d he said. \u201cMy answer is no.\u201dCommission officials rejected his accusations.The candidates\u2019 rivalry, as well as Zambia\u2019s stagnant economy, fueled a bitter campaign marred by killings and widespread violence. Last month, the electoral commission ordered the suspension of campaigning for 10 days in Lusaka and another district after clashes between the two main parties.Many election observers said supporters of the two parties were responsible for the violence, and they criticized Mr. Lungu for using government resources, especially the police, to his advantage.Monitors from the European Union said that, while the voting itself went smoothly on Election Day, campaigning had been \u201chindered by several factors.\u201dZambia, which had experienced smooth elections and transfers of power since 1991, was among the first countries on the continent where multiparty democracy emerged. Until last year, Zambia, Africa\u2019s second-biggest producer of copper after the Democratic Republic of Congo, had experienced rapid economic growth thanks to strong demand from China.Advertisement"}

Now, that\u2019s why he never won a state other than his own. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very realistic to imagine that he could have won the nomination without adopting a tone that would have been more problematic in the general election. If he could have, I think he might have had a lot of upside against Mrs. Clinton, who would have had to spend a lot of time and money trying to turn him into a generic Republican.Can he stay calm during the debates?

My humble apologies if I ruffled your feathers.\u201dThe reactions on Twitter were less forgiving.In Arizona, the aversion to Spanish in some quarters also underscores the angst of a vanishing majority that is still dominant in political and business circles.A state law bans bilingual education, or the practice of teaching non-English-speaking children in their native language while they also learn English, in public schools.Demographers project that Latinos, who make up 31 percent of Arizona\u2019s population, could become the state\u2019s largest ethnic group by 2020.The bilingual invitations to the Aug. 24 meeting went out Wednesday to the mayors of every city and town along the Mexico border, including Huachuca City, whose population of 1,900 is 15 percent Hispanic.Despite Mr. Cook\u2019s apology, Mr. Taylor continued his offensive. \u201cAmerican is going \u2018Down Hill\u2019 fast because we spend more time catering to others that are concerned with their own self interests.

He said his objection was not to the invitation, but rather to the organization that \u201cproduced literature putting America subservient to Mexico.\u201dHe added: \u201cI respect Mexicans and would correspond to them in Spanish first. It seems reasonable that Americans should be honored accordingly by our own.\u201dThe purpose of the border mayors association is to \u201caddress the opportunities and challenges facing the United States and Mexico in a global economy,\u201d Mr. Cook said.

{"Headline": "Coal Country Is Wary of Hillary Clinton\u2019s Pledge to Help", "Date": "2016-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLEBANON, Va. \u2014 As Kevin Widener was growing up on his family\u2019s tobacco farm in the rolling hills of southwest Virginia in the 1990s, lawmakers and lawyers in Washington were waging a war on smoking.As in the case of tobacco, the idea is not to save the old economy, but to create a new one by retraining miners, investing in infrastructure and technology, and luring new industries.But southwest Virginia is still suffering.\u201cThe government can\u2019t really help Appalachia,\u201d said Gary Lambert, a retired coal machinist who also sold his tobacco farm to the federal government. \u201cThe tobacco settlement was a rip-off. They ripped us up one side and down the other.\u201dThe settlement did pay for one of his sons, Thad, to go to college and become a teacher at the local high school. Another son, Brad, is back in the firing line: He\u2019s a coal miner.\u201cWe understand that each coal community is different,\u201d Mr. Houser said. \u201cWhat works in southeast Ohio is not necessarily going to work in southwest Virginia.\u201dThe effort would entail basic infrastructure work, such as road and sewage connections, along with new broadband, internet and cellphone technology; tax incentives for companies to locate in the region; and projects like turning old coal mines into industrial parks.There would also be efforts to promote tourism, with projects like converting coal fields into parks for all-terrain vehicles.The plan also calls for more spending on schools, modeled after a 1990s-era program to help schools in the Pacific Northwest after environmental regulations hit the lumber industry.But residents of southwest Virginia, 19 percent of whom live in poverty, can be forgiven for their skepticism.\u201cWe have great broadband, we\u2019ve gotten some call centers. That\u2019s helped us,\u201d said Terry Kilgore, chairman of the state\u2019s Tobacco Region Revitalization Commission. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t enough to replace tobacco, and it\u2019s not enough to replace coal.\u201dIt also seems to be far too little for the scale of the problem.Porterfield Highway illustrates the region\u2019s economic reality with billboards advertising high-speed broadband services, and rural aid programs to feed hungry children. In the tiny, largely boarded-up town of Sun, Va., Roger Bentley, a retired miner, recalled that more than a decade ago, Reynolds Metals Company built a factory here, lured by tax incentives to bring in non-tobacco companies. \u201cBut after the tax breaks run out,\u201d he said, \u201cthey left.\u201d\u201cRetraining is fine, but without mobility, much of the value of that retraining will be lost,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will have coal miners retrained in computer skills, but working in retail or not working at all.\u201dThe tobacco commission did have some successes, Mr. Chafin said. The problem, he said, is that many of the college-educated workers at Northrop Grumman are not local. And the new call center jobs pay about $12 an hour \u2014 far less than a coal miner\u2019s annual salary of $60,000 to $80,000.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to think of what other kind of retraining you give to coal miners,\u201d he said. \u201cThere just isn\u2019t enough here \u2014 and it\u2019s dubious to say that broadband will save us.\u201dBut that number, the study showed, includes a loss of 202,238 jobs associated with coal mining and coal-fired power generation in regions where they might not be replaced by the 256,177 new jobs associated with the manufacture of energy-efficient lighting and heating and cooling systems.\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be easy,\u201d Mr. Houser said. \u201cThe green shoots of diversified growth are showing up a lot more slowly than the rapid decline of coal. You\u2019re not going to flip a switch and suddenly have a robust diversified economy in southwest Virginia.\u201d\u201cThis is the perfect place for industries like drones and cybersecurity, because we\u2019re so remote,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said. \u201cThe drone industry is new. We can grow with it.\u201d\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the tobacco commission,\u201d Mr. Ivey said, \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201dAbout half of the team of 35 chemists, many dressed in skinny jeans and lab coats, are recent graduates of the University of Virginia\u2019s small campus in Wise, he said. OptaFuel also employs a few former coal miners as security guards.But, he conceded, \u201cfor the research jobs, you need a bachelor\u2019s degree\u201d \u2014 something most former coal miners do not have.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California\u2019s Emissions Goal Is a \u2018Milestone\u2019 on Climate Efforts", "Date": "2016-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 California will extend its landmark climate change legislation to 2030, a move that climate specialists say solidifies the state\u2019s role as a leader in the effort to curb heat-trapping emissions.Lawmakers have passed, and Gov. Jerry Brown has promised to sign, bills requiring the state to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels.Though the governor had already set a similar goal in an executive order, the legislation will lock the goals into law. The ambitious plan targets both power plants and vehicle emissions.\u201cThis is a real commitment backed up by real power,\u201d Mr. Brown said, calling it a milestone in the state\u2019s climate change efforts. He criticized the oil industry, which fought the legislation, as \u201cTrump-inspired acolytes.\u201dThe effort to decarbonize our economy, in California and throughout the world, is extremely difficult, it\u2019s a tall hill that we\u2019re climbing. There is a struggle and there is opposition,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have been vanquished, and vanquished in a very solid way. So bring it on; there will be more battles and more victories.\u201dCalifornia passed similar legislation in 2006 and is on track to meet its goal of reducing emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.This year, the Democratic-controlled Legislature approved the emissions bill, which will prioritize reductions from refineries, along with another measure that will give lawmakers more oversight of the state\u2019s Air Resources Board, which oversees the carrying out of the emissions standards. That bill is intended to send more money to poorer communities in the state that suffer some of the worst pollution.Several legislators from those areas have said that their districts have not benefited enough from money generated by the state\u2019s cap-and-trade program.Senator Fran Pavley, a Los Angeles-area Democrat who wrote the 2006 legislation and one of the bills passed this week, said that much had changed in the past decade and that state lawmakers were no longer debating the potential effect of climate change.\u201cPeople once thought we were being alarmist when we talked about drought and year-round wildfires,\u201d she said. \u201cBut all these predictions have come true, and the realities of climate change seem to be accelerating and are tangibly visible sooner than I ever expected. The discussion here now is how to address it, not if.\u201dThe legislation does not address the struggling cap-and-trade program. The program is facing a lawsuit from the California Chamber of Commerce, which contends that the tax is unconstitutional.Mr. Brown has suggested that he would consider a ballot initiative to get voter approval of the program. It has brought in far less revenue than expected in the most recent auctions, which require companies to buy credits to release greenhouse gas emissions.John Sterman, a professor and climate policy expert at the MIT Sloan School of Management, said California\u2019s move sent an unambiguous message that major political forces support such action. \u201cIt says, We\u2019re committed to this task,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going back.\u201dIn a practical sense, Dr. Sterman said, the decision gives companies and innovators clear direction about how to make investments. That could lead companies to drive down their prices in alternative energies, he said.Still, Dr. Sterman said, even California\u2019s ambitious goals fall short of what will ultimately be needed to head off severe effects of climate change. \u201cAs welcome as California\u2019s action is, it\u2019s still not aggressive enough,\u201d he said.The move solidifies California\u2019s leadership in the United States, said Andrew Jones, a director of Climate Interactive, a nonprofit think tank.\u201cThey\u2019re almost in a class by themselves,\u201d he said, adding the effects were reflected in lower per-capita energy use by state residents. At the same time, he said, California\u2019s efforts set a pace and tone for other states that will be reinforced by extending the law to 2030.\u201cIf we have backsliding in California,\u201d he said, \u201cit hurts other states.\u201dThough federal emission reduction plans have stalled, several states are setting ambitious new targets. New York recently approved a 50 percent reduction goal for power plants. And Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado said this week that he had drafted an executive order seeking a 35 percent reduction in greenhouse gases from the state\u2019s power plants by 2030 compared with 2012 levels.Jennifer Medina reported from Los Angeles, and Matt Richtel from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Some Good News for Investors: The Bull May Still Have Spring in Its Step", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe bull market in stocks has been supported by two fundamental pillars: high corporate earnings and low interest rates. Both of these mainstays appeared wobbly early this year. Fortunately for investors, there is now some good news for both of them.Corporate earnings and cash flow, which had flagged, are stabilizing and perhaps rising, according to a stream of corporate reports released during the quarterly earnings season, which is nearing its end.Taken together, this information is hardly a guarantee that stocks will continue to rise or that current market levels will seem sensible years from now. But for investors, the interest rate and earnings environment has become friendly again, and without these buttresses, the outlook for stocks would be much gloomier.As he acknowledged, it\u2019s not entirely a rosy picture, and the numbers are complicated enough to make your head swim. On a year-to-year basis, for example, earnings in the second quarter are expected to have declined more than 2.2 percent for companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, according to a tally by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That\u2019s hardly cause for rejoicing.Exclude energy companies, however, and year-to-year earnings improved to a positive 2.3 percent growth rate. Moreover, Mr. Yardeni noted that compared with the level of the previous quarter, overall earnings for companies in the S.&P. 500 increased in the second quarter. And while the consensus of Wall Street analysts is that the current quarter\u2019s earnings will post another year-over-year decline, Mr. Yardeni expects that earnings will at least be no worse than they were in the previous quarter and will perhaps grow modestly.\u201cThe point is that earnings are much better than you might have expected, given the dollar, given what happened to energy and commodity prices, and given the slow growth of the global economy,\u201d he said.What\u2019s more, the cash generated by corporate America has allowed companies not only to pay reasonably handsome dividends but also to buy back large quantities of their own shares. These buybacks have strengthened the market: By reducing the number of shares, they have been making earnings per share look much better, and that should continue.But the simplest way of looking at it, he says, and the most important for an investor, is to consider how interest rates affect the value of a stock and a bond. \u201cLow rates have had a big effect on the stock market,\u201d he said. \u201cStock is much, much cheaper than bonds at today\u2019s interest rates.\u201dThis comparison may seem odd, if you\u2019re not accustomed to thinking this way. It works like this: For the S.&P. 500, the price-to-earnings ratio is about 20, which means that for every $100 worth of stock, you receive $5 in earnings. By comparison, a 10-year Treasury note, with a yield of 1.6 percent, pays out only $1.60 for a $100 investment. The bond has a price-to-earnings ratio of more than 60, meaning that it\u2019s more than three times as expensive as stock. If interest rates rose to, say, 10 percent, their rough level in 1979, he said, the price-to-earnings ratio of bonds would drop to 10: Current stock prices would look unreasonably high in that environment, he said.\u201cIn the world we live in right now,\u201d he said, \u201clow interest rates make stocks look very good, at least in comparison to bonds.\u201dThat\u2019s why the latest signals from the bond market, and the latest statements from the Federal Reserve, are so important for stock investors. They indicate that while rates are likely to rise moderately in the United States in the next year, they probably won\u2019t rise very much, and low rates will be with us for some time. Inflation is very low, growth is meager, and the economy is vulnerable to shocks.In her speech on Friday in Jackson Hole, Ms. Yellen acknowledged as much. If the economy continues to improve, she said, the Fed will raise its benchmark federal funds rate, as it has stated for many months. That rate is now between 0.25 and 0.5 percent. But she also emphasized that the central bank wasn\u2019t likely to raise rates very much.This raises complex problems for central bankers. For stock investors, though, it provides straightforward confirmation of a central assumption of the bull market: While there may be some short-term increases, low interest rates are likely to be here for some time to come.That\u2019s not entirely positive. If economic growth were stronger, inflation would probably be higher and interest rates would rise. Without strong growth, churning out robust corporate earnings will be a challenge. For now, though, the twin pillars of the stock market remain intact. That could keep the bull market in stocks, now in its eighth year, cavorting for a while longer.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

What is surprising is that it has taken so long for the issue to gain prominence. After all, affordable high-quality child care is one remedy to the long stagnation in wages afflicting most of the work force. It is also an antidote to the waning productivity that threatens future living standards.High-quality child care is a win-win, helping to raise earnings now and increase productivity over the long term while enriching the lives of children.

In recent days, residents have taken to the streets to oppose any decision to build the plant nearby. The main urban area of Lianyungang is just 20 miles southwest of a large and growing nuclear power plant on the coast, but the idea of a nuclear fuel reprocessing facility also being built in the area seemed to push public unease to a new height.A 21-year-old Lianyungang resident with the surname Tang said Wednesday that demonstrators had been chanting \u201cOppose nuclear waste, defend our home.\u201d Like other people contacted there, she did not want her full name used, citing fear of reprisal for talking to reporters.\u201cNobody wants this kind of thing built in their own home,\u201d Ms. Tang said.China\u2019s authoritarian leaders are wary of local protests escalating into broader challenges to their power. But local governments have often given ground in the face of growing public opposition to chemical plants, waste incinerators and other potential sources of pollution. Now proposed nuclear projects are also becoming increasingly troublesome.\u201cWhile the Chinese government does not hesitate to arrest the few political dissidents, it spends more time and energy to appease public demands,\u201d Wenfang Tang, a professor of political science at the University of Iowa, who studies public opinion and politics in China, said in emailed comments.\u201cThe high level of government sensitivity and responsiveness to public opinion further encourages political activism in Chinese society,\u201d Professor Tang said. \u201cThe louder you are, the more quickly the government will respond.\u201dDespite warnings from the government, protests continued on a smaller scale this week, as residents defied ranks of riot officers with shields, according to news reports and video that people shared through social media.But in China, suspensions of contentious projects have a way of quietly turning into permanent cancellations, and Lianyungang appears likely to follow that pattern.

{"Headline": "\u2018Brexit\u2019 Vote Feeds Scotland\u2019s Alienation", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisIn the June 23 referendum on British membership in the European Union, Scotland is one pristine color, voting to remain, while England and Wales are a different color, voting to leave.Similarly, in the May 2015 general elections, Scotland is again a different color from the south; the abject collapse of the Labour Party here left Scotland nearly a one-party state, run by the Scottish National Party, which was founded to bring Scotland independence from the rest of the United Kingdom.Scottish nationalists lost a referendum on independence in September 2014, by 55 percent to 45 percent. But so many people, especially the young, were motivated by the campaign that they nearly quintupled the membership of the left-wing S.N.P. Only a year later, the party won 50 percent of the vote and 56 of 59 Scottish seats at Westminster.The vote for a British exit, or Brexit, swung by England and Wales, felt crushing to the Scots, who have strongly favored membership in the European Union and its single market, feeding their alienation from the Conservative-led United Kingdom.The day after the exit vote, the Scottish leader, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon of the S.N.P., said that another referendum on Scottish independence was \u201chighly likely\u201d and that Scotland was being \u201cdragged out of the E.U. against our will.\u201d Polling since shows an increase in support for independence.At the Edinburgh Festival this week, street musicians played \u201cOde to Joy,\u201d the European Union\u2019s anthem, and supporters of quitting Europe were scarce.But despite everything, another independence referendum feels far away. Business leaders and even some nationalists caution that too much is now in play, and that to lose a second vote would be fatal to Ms. Sturgeon\u2019s leadership, as the loss of the first one was to her predecessor, Alex Salmond.How Britain will manage its departure from the European Union and under what conditions remains wholly unclear. How much duty-free access to the European single market will there be, and for what sectors? Scotland, its oil revenues sinking, has concerns about access to European markets that are not the same as London\u2019s.It is not even certain that Britain will Brexit, even after invoking Article 50, which will start two years of negotiations with Brussels. If the deal that emerges is bad, the British government might ask for another referendum. In any case, the next few years are full of uncertainty. So what\u2019s the rush?Further, the relationship of an independent Scotland with the European Union is hardly obvious. Would Scotland have to apply as a beginner, and promise to adopt the euro? Would Spain, which wants to dissuade Catalonia from independence, veto Scottish membership?Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of Spain was blunt in June. \u201cIf the U.K. leaves, so does Scotland,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Spanish government rejects any negotiation with anyone other than the U.K. I\u2019m radically against it, the treaties are radically against it, and I think everyone else is radically against it.\u201dAnd if Britain does leave the European Union, and Scotland then votes to leave the United Kingdom, the same questions pertain, as well as others like the size of Scotland\u2019s budget deficit, which is now 9.5 percent of gross domestic product, twice that of Britain as a whole and three times the level Brussels allows of new members.Consequently, many believe Ms. Sturgeon is actually using the threat of another referendum to increase her bargaining power with the British prime minister, Theresa May, over the exit negotiations. Ms. Sturgeon wants to maintain access to the single market, but at the same time, she must keep faith with party members who consider Brexit a legitimate reason to quit the kingdom.Menzies Campbell, the former leader of the Liberal Democrats, described Ms. Sturgeon as a thoughtful gradualist at heart, who must manage nationalist passions with an eye toward Scotland\u2019s best interests and its best chance at independence.\u201cShe describes herself as a utilitarian nationalist, that is to say not nationalist as an end to itself but a means to an end,\u201d Mr. Campbell said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a view necessarily held in her party or among the many thousands who joined the S.N.P. after the referendum.\u201dEven those who consider Scottish independence inevitable think it must wait until popular support solidifies. The usual line, even from Ms. Sturgeon, is that opinion polls should consistently show 60 percent in favor before risking another vote. Her real challenge is to win over those who were tempted by independence in 2014 but voted \u201cno\u201d because of economic uncertainties.Ms. Sturgeon and her party, while generally praised for competence, have some serious domestic problems, like the quality of education and public health and the struggle to maintain generous social benefits in an economy slowing because of lower oil revenue. So there is work to do at home.And in Ruth Davidson, the combative, funny leader of the Conservative Party in Scotland, Ms. Sturgeon has a lively opponent. The other day, Ms. Davidson accused her of \u201ccynical posturing,\u201d trying to \u201ctwist the disappointment\u201d felt in Scotland by the Brexit vote into \u201csupport for separation,\u201d which Ms. Davidson opposes.\u201cI did not vote \u2018Remain\u2019 to see the S.N.P. use my vote to nurture yet more grievance,\u201d she said. Instead, she urged Ms. Sturgeon to drop talk of independence and \u201cturn our full attention\u201d to Scotland\u2019s future. But for Ms. Sturgeon, the two are the same.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Housing Market Is Finally Starting to Look Healthy", "Date": "2016-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic TrendsIt has been an excruciatingly long time coming, but the housing sector in the United States is finally getting healthy. Thank millennials and thank homebuilders who are starting to produce more of the starter houses young people demand.Builders have started work on new housing units at a pace of more than 1 million homes a year every month since April 2015, more than doubling from a low of 478,000 in the spring of 2009. Residential investment has made a positive contribution to overall gross domestic product for eight of the last nine quarters (and economists think that a drop in the second quarter was an aberration).And in home price trends, there are some good signs, too, though not in the obvious way. In the new Census Bureau report Tuesday, the median sale price for new homes actually fell, to $294,600 from $310,500 in June. That is a strong hint that there is more supply being built at the lower end of the housing market. In other words, exactly the kind of smaller houses that young adults can afford.\u201cFor years, the market has been practically begging builders to both ramp up their efforts over all and to put more focus on serving the less expensive end of the market,\u201d said Svenja Gudell, the chief economist of Zillow, in an email. \u201cToday\u2019s data confirms both are happening in earnest.\u201d\u201cThe dip in price will be welcome relief to buyers struggling to find affordable inventory in this incredibly tight market.\u201dThat data isn\u2019t adjusted based on the size and quality of the house, meaning it implies a shift toward slightly smaller houses. But home price data that is adjusted for price and quality shows price gains that are gradual and steady \u2014 not a return to double-digit percentage rises that were evident in the boom-bust cycle of a decade ago. The S.&P./Case-Shiller home price index composite of 20 major cities has been rising at something very close to a 5 percent rate for two straight years.That rate is a bit higher than the rate of growth in incomes, but is less worrisome than the double-digit percentage gains in home prices that prevailed continuously from the summer of 2002 to mid-2006, the peak of the housing bubble.Here\u2019s a narrative of the housing market over the last decade. As the housing bubble popped in 2007 and a global financial crisis and recession developed in 2008, home prices plummeted. Builders slashed their production of houses to below the level that long-term demographics would suggest is necessary to house an ever-growing population. There was a combination of oversupply from the boom years and tight credit because of the financial freeze-up. At the same time, people who had lost jobs and income because of the recession were in no position to buy.But that was nearly a decade ago, and now we\u2019ve had years when young adults have entered their prime home-buying time. Yet relatively few new houses to fulfill eventual demand were built. Mortgage rates have stayed near record lows, and job creation has been relatively strong. All that has been missing is homes in the right places and at the right prices for those young people to buy.The biggest apparent weak spot in the housing data now tends to confirm this way of looking at it. The homeownership rate has been falling pretty steadily from a record peak at the end of 2004, when it was 69.2 percent, to 62.9 percent in the second quarter of this year.Today\u2019s young adults have not become homeowners at the same rate that earlier generations did. That probably reflects a mix of a weak economy \u2014 and thus poor job prospects during the initial aftermath of the recession \u2014 and the lack of affordable housing supply in many of the hottest markets combined with perhaps some cultural shift toward buying homes later or even not buying at all.The current level of homeownership looks less disappointing if you consider the period of the mid-2000s to be an aberration born of the loose credit of the housing boom. The current 62.9 percent homeownership rate is the same as it was in the first half of 1965 and is only a bit below its level in the mid-1980s, when it hovered at 63 to 64 percent.The question now is how far this housing expansion has to run, given the pent-up demand. Residential investment is currently 3.8 percent of G.D.P., compared with a 4.6 percent average since 1947. That implies there is further room for gains, even assuming that there is no repeat of the bubble experience from the last decade. It\u2019s a rosy picture \u2014 and there\u2019s reason to think it could last.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Seems More the Result of a Shift Among White Men Than the Cause of It", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 2016 RaceMany people believe that Donald Trump is about to remake the Republican Party.The party is changing, but data from this election and the previous two suggest that some of the changes have little to do with Mr. Trump expanding the party. Mr. Trump may instead be helping Hillary Clinton expand the Democratic Party, reshaping his own party by shrinking it.By comparing Mr. Trump\u2019s Republican constituency with previous configurations of the party, like Mr. Romney\u2019s in 2012 or John McCain\u2019s in 2008, a pattern emerges: The so-called expansion of the party had already started in 2012, with a shift of white men without college degrees toward Mr. Romney \u2014 predating Mr. Trump.Mrs. Clinton is doing far better among white women in 2016 than Barack Obama did in 2008 or 2012. In both of Mr. Obama\u2019s elections, he lost white women by single digits (by three percentage points and then by six). Polls show that Mrs. Clinton is winning them \u2014 by 10 points. You could say that this was more about Mr. Obama than Mrs. Clinton, but breaking down the support from white women by education helps illustrate the role that Mr. Trump may be playing in this shift.The large gains among white women for Mrs. Clinton are coming from those with a college education, although even white women with no college education have moved a bit toward the Democrats in 2016. The college-educated group preferred Mr. Obama to Mr. McCain by three points in 2008 and the president to Mr. Romney by one point in 2012, according to data from Pew. But they are going for Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Trump by 31 points.That\u2019s a number worth pausing on.Mrs. Clinton is winning the white, college-educated female vote by around 30 more points than the Democrat in the last two presidential elections. By any standard, that\u2019s a very large shift in public opinion.A similar thing is happening among white men, who have typically preferred Republicans in presidential elections. Mr. Trump is shedding a significant number of white college-educated men. Mr. McCain won this group by 20 points and Mr. Romney by 11, according to Pew\u2019s series of June election-year surveys. But Mr. Trump has only a seven-point advantage, according to polls. He has alienated both college-educated men and women, sending both to the Democratic Party in larger shares than in previous presidential election years. In other words, he has expanded the other party.The Upshot\u2019s presidential forecast, updated daily.But not everyone is reacting this way. The gains for the Democrats among the college-educated are only part of the story. The survey data also show Mr. Trump making modest gains over all among white men, about five points more than in 2012. The increase comes from white men without a college education; he is up 10 points with that group relative to Mr. Romney and up 20 from Mr. McCain\u2019s margin in 2008.This brings Mr. Trump\u2019s advantage among white men without a college education to a whopping 37 points over Mrs. Clinton. This may also be a reaction to Mr. Trump\u2019s words and actions, but the trend toward the G.O.P. among these men started before Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, in gains for Mr. Romney in the 2012 election. If the party is expanding in this way, the data suggest Mr. Trump may be more the result of the shifting than the cause of it.Among white women, however, the shift to Mrs. Clinton looks more episodic. Across both education groups, they moved away from Mr. Obama in 2012 relative to 2008. Is their return to the Democratic nominee in 2016 merely a reaction to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s being the first woman to be nominated by a major American party or is it a reaction to Mr. Trump? Given how hard Mrs. Clinton had to fight for women\u2019s votes in her own party primaries against Bernie Sanders, it seems unlikely that women are generally drawn to her because of their shared gender. It is more likely that Mr. Trump has driven them to her.Political scientists talk a lot about how fundamental conditions like the state of the economy, the number of terms a party has been in office and the president\u2019s approval rating drive election outcomes and how hard it is for campaigns to shift the outcome when both candidates are fighting hard.

{"Headline": "Playing With Fire in Ukraine", "Date": "2016-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialTwo years after President Vladimir Putin of Russia annexed Crimea and began destabilizing eastern Ukraine, tensions are rising anew, with news reports suggesting that he may be preparing for yet another military confrontation with the pro-Western government in Kiev.Given his endless capacity for intimidation and unpredictability, it\u2019s possible that Mr. Putin is merely manufacturing the threat of a crisis to strengthen his diplomatic hand and extricate Russia from economic sanctions imposed by the West beginning in 2014. Yet regardless of his intentions, the provocations, real or feigned, could spin out of control. It is essential for Europe and the United States to keep the sanctions in place and remind Mr. Putin that they will not be lifted until he has helped bring peace to Ukraine.Hence the guessing game. Does Mr. Putin seriously intend to seize even more territory from a sovereign nation? He revels in unpredictability. He enjoys keeping his adversaries on edge. But it is also true that he went to war with Georgia in 2008 and sent aircraft and troops to intervene in the Syrian war on behalf of President Bashar al-Assad. Even so, Mr. Putin\u2019s economy is a mess, which by itself is reason to wonder whether he would entangle himself in a broader conflict in Ukraine and risk even tougher sanctions, when what he really wants is to get those sanctions lifted.The smart diplomatic money, at least for the moment, is on the idea that what he\u2019s really after is a better deal. With Europe focused on a refugee crisis and Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, and America riveted by a presidential election, this is plainly a time for ratcheting up tensions, keeping Ukraine off balance and even raising the threat of a wider war to achieve what are essentially economic and political goals.Among these is amending the 2015 Minsk II agreement, which was supposed to result in a permanent cease-fire; a withdrawal of troops and heavy weapons from key points in the conflict zone; and Ukrainian political reforms, including elections. Although there are violations on both sides, the deal has foundered largely because of Russia and its separatist allies. The Germans, the French and the Americans have been urging Russia to attend peace negotiations on the sidelines of next month\u2019s G-20 summit meeting in China, but so far Mr. Putin has refused.The European Union is expected to renew the sanctions this year, but some countries, like Italy, are eager to resume economic activity with Russia and not wait for the Minsk agreement to be fully implemented. Mr. Putin, who is counting on some caving, cannot be rewarded for his aggression.Advertisement"}

In theory, the satellite can provide the connection between them. The first major link in China would be between Beijing and Shanghai, and might open this year, according to Xinhua.The satellite, which weighs over 1,300 pounds, is called Quantum Experiments at Space Scale, or Quess, and nicknamed Micius, after a Chinese philosopher and scientist in the fifth century B.C.Pan Jianwei, the chief scientist of the quantum satellite project, told Xinhua earlier that the overall project involved building four ground stations for quantum communication and one station in space for experimental quantum teleportation.\u201cThe lucky thing was that, in 2000, the economy of China started to grow, so the timing was suddenly right to do good science,\u201d Nature quoted him as saying.Kenneth Chang contributed reporting from New York.

{"Headline": "Review: In \u2018Hillbilly Elegy,\u2019 a Tough Love Analysis of the Poor Who Back Trump", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of The TimesAfter reading \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d you can easily understand why. This is a historically peculiar election cycle, boisterously disrupted by outsiders, one of whom found the perfect host body in the Republican Party and became its presidential nominee. An investigation of voter estrangement has never felt more urgent, and we\u2019re certainly not getting one from the lacquered chatterers on the boob tube.Now, along comes Mr. Vance, offering a compassionate, discerning sociological analysis of the white underclass that has helped drive the politics of rebellion, particularly the ascent of Donald J. Trump. Combining thoughtful inquiry with firsthand experience, Mr. Vance has inadvertently provided a civilized reference guide for an uncivilized election, and he\u2019s done so in a vocabulary intelligible to both Democrats and Republicans.Imagine that.On the checklist of modern privilege, Mr. Vance, 31, has the top four in the bag: He is white, male, straight and Protestant.But his profile is misleading. His people \u2014 hillbillies, rednecks, white trash, choose your epithet (or term of affection, depending on your point of view) \u2014 didn\u2019t step off the Mayflower and become part of America\u2019s ascendant class. \u201cPoverty is the family tradition,\u201d he writes. His ancestors and kin were sharecroppers, coal miners, machinists, millworkers \u2014 all low-paying, body-wearying occupations that over the years have vanished or offered diminished security.Mr. Vance was raised in Middletown, Ohio, a now-decaying steel town filled with Kentucky transplants, which at one point included his Mamaw and Papaw \u2014 in newscaster English, that\u2019s grandma and grandpa \u2014 who moved there shortly after World War II. Though the couple eventually managed to achieve the material comforts of a middle-class life (house, car), they brought their Appalachian values and habits with them. Some were wonderfully positive, like loyalty and love of country. But others, like a tendency toward violence and verbal abuse, were inimical to family life.Papaw was forever coming home drunk. Mamaw, \u201ca violent nondrunk,\u201d was forever tormenting him, whether by serving him artfully arranged plates of garbage for dinner or dousing him with gasoline. All this guerrilla warfare affected their children. Mr. Vance\u2019s mother was an empress of instability \u2014 violent, feckless, prone to hysteria. A long stint in rehab couldn\u2019t shake her addiction to prescription narcotics (she\u2019d later move on to heroin). She spun through more boyfriends than this reader could count and at least five husbands.The only reason Mr. Vance made it out in one piece is because his grandparents eventually reconciled, becoming his unofficial guardians. (He also spent a terrifically affirming four years in the Marines.) Mamaw was especially encouraging. She was tough as snakeskin, foul-mouthed as a mobster and filled with love. In a town where many children don\u2019t finish high school, she raised a grandson who managed to graduate from Ohio State University and Yale Law School, defying skyscraping odds.\u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d in my mind, divides into two components: the family stories Mr. Vance tells \u2014 most of which are no doubt better experienced on the page than they were in real life \u2014 and the questions he raises. Chief among them: How much should he hold his hillbilly kin responsible for their own misfortunes?In Mr. Vance\u2019s estimation, the answer is: a lot. Economic insecurity, he\u2019s convinced, accounts for only a small part of his community\u2019s problems; the much larger issue is hillbilly culture itself. Though proud of it in many ways, he\u2019s also convinced that it \u201cincreasingly encourages social decay instead of counteracting it.\u201dHis frustration with the nonworking white poor is especially acute. He recalls being a cashier at a Middletown grocery store and watching resentfully as his neighbors, who had creatively gamed the welfare system, jabbered on their cellphones as they were going through the checkout line.He could not afford a cellphone.\u201cPolitical scientists have spent millions of words trying to explain how Appalachia and the South went from staunchly Democratic to staunchly Republican in less than a generation,\u201d Mr. Vance writes. He suspects those cellphones have a lot to do with it. \u201cI could never understand why our lives felt like a struggle while those living off of government largess enjoyed trinkets that I only dreamed about.\u201dTime and again, Mr. Vance preaches a message of tough love and personal responsibility. He has no patience with an old acquaintance who told him he quit his job because he hated waking up early, only to take to Facebook to blame the \u201cObama economy.\u201d Or with a former co-worker at a tile warehouse who missed work once a week though his girlfriend was pregnant.The difference is that President Obama believes poverty, though it may have a cultural component, is largely a structural problem, one the government can play a large role in fixing. Mr. Vance, a conservative, takes a far dimmer view.Whether you agree with Mr. Vance or not, you must admire him for his head-on confrontation with a taboo subject. And he frames his critique generously, stipulating that it isn\u2019t laziness that\u2019s destroying hillbilly culture but what the psychologist Martin Seligman calls \u201clearned helplessness\u201d \u2014 the fatalistic belief, born of too much adversity, that nothing can be done to change your lot.What he\u2019s really writing about is despair.Never is Mr. Vance more aware of this pessimism and estrangement than when he leaves for Ohio State University. He\u2019s plumped with hope; his neighbors, left behind, feel its opposite. \u201cThere was something almost spiritual,\u201d he writes, \u201cabout the cynicism of the community at large.\u201dHis friends and relations are convinced that the media lies. That politicians lie. That the military, an institution they revere, is fighting two fruitless wars. Universities feel \u201crigged\u201d and inaccessible; job prospects are slim. For what purpose do you live under such circumstances? When the stanchions of your life have sunk into the muck?Mr. Vance doesn\u2019t have all the answers. But he\u2019s advancing the conversation.Hillbilly ElegyA Memoir of a Family and Culture in CrisisBy J. D. Vance264 pages. Harper. $27.99.Advertisement"}

He was from the start an anomaly in the Socialist government, having spent two much contested years challenging party orthodoxies \u2014 to relatively modest effect, in the view of analysts.Mr. Hollande\u2019s office said Mr. Macron was resigning \u201cto devote himself entirely to his political movement,\u201d and indeed Mr. Macron sounded like a candidate in his own statement Tuesday afternoon. He was stepping down to \u201cundertake a new step in my struggle,\u201d he said, and to \u201cbuild a project that will serve only the general interest.\u201dWhile Mr. Macron was once Mr. Hollande\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9, he now represents a political threat to the president on his right. In polls, Mr. Macron routinely leads his erstwhile boss, whose support languishes in the midteens, and he often comes in second to the putative front-runner and former prime minister, Alain Jupp\u00e9, who is the mayor of Bordeaux.They are joined by an increasingly crowded field that also includes former president Nicolas Sarkozy, a flock of lesser government veterans, and several of Mr. Hollande\u2019s own former ministers.A quick-on-his feet technocrat, Mr. Macron has followed the traditional French elite path of exclusive schools and early proximity to the powerful, along with a banking stint at Rothschild & Company. He has never held elected office.He has had a knack for keeping France\u2019s unions and left on low boil with positions that clearly favor free markets. Since creating his own idealistic political movement in the spring, Mr. Macron has attracted sizable crowds to his rallies, particularly of young people, and has openly considered running for president.Nevertheless, at a rally in central Paris last month, when Mr. Macron stopped just short of announcing his candidacy, he told hundreds of cheering supporters, \u201cnothing can stop this movement now.\u201dHe continued, \u201cThis movement, we will carry it together to 2017, and all the way to victory!\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lower Medal Count in Rio Rattles China\u2019s Olympics Obsession", "Date": "2016-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Even before the Olympic flame is extinguished in Rio de Janeiro, China is deep in debate about its showing in the Summer Games. Many Chinese are asking if the nation\u2019s once insatiable appetite for medals has hit a limit.China is vying to come in second in the gold medal tally, behind the United States and a bit ahead of Britain. While it has often finished second in the Games, China\u2019s number of gold and overall medals is down considerably, especially in some sports in which it has been strong, generating angst in a country that is used to viewing its medal count as a measure of rising national power.For many athletes and fans here, even the relatively minor slip in results has smarted.\u201cThey were so young and lacked experience in major competition,\u201d Ms. Liu said. \u201cAt the Olympic Games, even very small faults in moves can mean goodbye to gold medals.\u201dComing in second \u2014 or third, if China falters over the next few days \u2014 in the gold medal count would be a dream come true for many countries, especially poorer ones. But the discussion in China has reflected an ambivalent public that takes great pride in international sporting achievement, yet is no longer sure that medals are worth so much single-minded sacrifice from athletes and taxpayers.Many people are also critical of the state sports administration, saying it has failed to adapt fast enough to a changing society, which is sending fewer children for the hard training needed to become Olympic champions, newspaper commentaries and experts have argued.Chinese athletes have often come from small towns, where parents saw tough training in sports schools as a doorway to a better life for their children. But nowadays fewer parents want to wager their children\u2019s future on the distant hope of an Olympic medal, and administrators have not done enough to attract more children into amateur clubs and school teams, coaches and experts said.The account of which countries have dominated the Summer Olympics is also a snapshot of modern history.\u201cThis result shows there needs to be reflection, but it\u2019s difficult to make the sports administration change itself,\u201d Mr. Yang said. \u201cUntil now, there\u2019s been a lot of shouting slogans, but not too much real action.\u201d\u201cI think China will finish second,\u201d Simon Gleave, the head of analysis at Gracenote Sports, said Thursday in a telephone interview from Nieuwegein, the Netherlands. He estimated that China could end up with 24 gold medals when the Games finish on Sunday. It won 38 in London in 2012, well ahead of Britain.\u201cThey still have a lot of events to come where they\u2019ve got big favorites,\u201d he said, noting the strong Chinese competitors in canoeing, diving and badminton. \u201cGreat Britain is running low on gold medal chances.\u201dEven so, some comments in state-run news media and internet forums have excoriated the Chinese team for failing to deliver medals.In Rio, Chinese gymnasts have won two bronze medals. In London in 2012, they won five gold medals and 12 over all; in Beijing in 2008, 11 gold medals and 18 in total. Chinese athletes have also performed worse than in previous Games in their other traditional strengths of badminton and swimming, said Mr. Gleave, the analyst.China\u2019s medal shortfalls, Mr. Gleave said, \u201chave been due to an underperformance in a limited number of sports.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not as if the whole team is much, much worse,\u201d he said.As if to counter public gloom, state-run news media have also argued in recent days that the Chinese no longer care about Olympic triumphs the way they did before, especially during the Beijing Games of 2008.\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a change, a shift from the patriotic duty to bring honor to our country to a more relaxed and open attitude toward the Olympic Games,\u201d said Ms. Liu, the former gymnast.Chinese athletes are likely to feel pressure to improve for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. There is deep public rancor in China toward Japan, and the government has already demanded that China be at the forefront of the medal tally in Tokyo. That longer-term ambition may even help explain some of China\u2019s poor results in Rio, Mr. Gleave said.\u201cThe participants that China has taken to Rio are quite a bit younger than they were in 2012 or 2008,\u201d he said. \u201cThat suggests to me that there is a level of planning going into this, leading up to Tokyo by giving younger competitors an opportunity.\u201dEmily Feng, Carolyn Zhang and Adam Wu contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Love. Labor. Lost.", "Date": "2016-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe StoneIt has not, by any measure, been a Summer of Love; more like a Summer of Anxiety, Fear and Hate. It would be facile to respond to recent events \u2014 political upheaval, mass murder, police violence and festering racism \u2014 with a call to \u201clove.\u201d But in extreme times, it\u2019s worth considering: Can love (as we know it) act as a radical force rather than a distraction? Does our current idea of love need revision? Is there a new kind of love emerging in new social movements, one that works against the narrow kind of love fostered by capitalism? I discussed these and other matters with Moira Weigel, the author of \u201cLabor of Love: The Invention of Dating.\u201d \u2014 Natasha LennardBut what love is, and what it could be, are hardly self-evident. Sometimes we speak of love as if it is a form of instinct, emanating directly from our biology. Goethe borrowed a metaphor from chemistry to describe how spontaneously bonds of attraction and affection can form: \u201celective affinities.\u201d These kinds of metaphors are tempting, because attraction and affection surely do involve biological and bodily processes that we may not clearly perceive or intellectually understand. Yet they are incomplete.We are paid for none of it. The re-creation of the world reproduces a social good that people of all genders hold in common. Yet very few public conversations about women and family acknowledge that these activities do anything more than gratify a personal impulse. The fact that childbearing and child rearing are not paid or subsidized reinforces the idea that these activities are not valuable labors: they are love.We may be seeing the first steps toward policy changes that could help set straight this centuries-old con with the new paid family leave laws in California and New York. It is critical that any such laws offer paid leave to parents and caregivers of all genders; otherwise, while they may alleviate the pressures on individual women, they may reinforce the prejudice that says that care work is women\u2019s work. We still have a long way to go.Angela Davis, too, has written very lucidly on how love can be used to forge new counter-public spheres \u2014 say, anti-racist family units. Davis specifically describes how white middle class feminists, because they had experienced the home as a site of oppression, tended to downplay its creative possibilities; she proposes that African-American women, who constantly encountered violence and racism in the outside world of work saw the family as a liberating space to create other possibilities.So I like what Pettman says here. We should be wary of how the language of love can discipline us to consume and work. And yet, I do have reservations about the ways that some anticapitalist thinkers like Alain Badiou, Jean Baudrillard and Slavoj Zizek, have tried to treat love and erotic experience as the \u201cother\u201d of capitalism or its outside \u2014 a last refuge of authenticity in a corrupt world. I think there\u2019s often a kind of crypto-misogyny at work in that kind of romanticism.There is such a long tradition in European philosophy that idealizes women \u2014 or, more precisely, the concept of \u201cwoman\u201d \u2014 by defining us in opposition to the male world. This kind of rhetoric purports to elevate \u201cus.\u201d Yet it dehumanizes us in the process. We become the shadow of what exists. I am thinking, for instance, of how Nietzsche uses the concept of \u201ceternal feminine,\u201d inherited from earlier German Romantics, and how Jacques Derrida and other post-structuralists pick up on his famous proposition, \u201cWhat if truth is a woman \u2014 what then?\u201d And Sigmund Freud, and the psychoanalytic tradition that defines women in terms of \u201clack.\u201d Lack, that is, of a phallus.The great irony is that, by romanticizing the feminine and the erotic, avowed anticapitalists like Baudrillard, Bourdieu and Zizek end up perpetuating one of the founding lies of modern capitalism. This may be its most important myth: that the work that women do in bearing and raising children is not work. It is simply part of nature. And nature is what you can take for free, without having to feel bad about it.For me, Hillary epitomizes a kind of representative feminism. Many of the policies that she has supported throughout her career have been terrible for women. As first lady, she supported welfare reform that impoverished mothers and children, a crime omnibus bill that fueled the \u201cNew Jim Crow\u201d of mass incarceration, corporate education reforms that vilified teachers unions, a predominantly female profession. As a New York senator and secretary of state, she has consistently promoted hawkish foreign policies that have led to the deaths of women and children abroad.I believe that this language conflating passion and profession is becoming an increasingly shameless pretext to exploit precarious workers. It makes us feel that if we do not want to work all the time for not enough pay we have personally failed. You should not have to talk about your \u201cpassion for food and beverage service\u201d to get a job as a barista, nor your \u201cpassion for retail\u201d to get a job folding sweaters. We should not feel so bound to love our work that we do not have time or resources for love \u2014 or life \u2014 itself.Advertisement"}

So how should she respond?The obvious answer, you might think, is that she should keep doing what she is doing \u2014 emphasizing how unfit her rival is for office, letting her allies point out her own qualifications and continuing to advocate a moderately center-left policy agenda that is largely a continuation of President Obama\u2019s.But at least some commentators are calling on her to do something very different \u2014 to make a right turn, moving the Democratic agenda toward the preferences of those fleeing the sinking Republican ship. The idea, I guess, is to offer to create an American version of a European-style grand coalition of the center-left and the center-right.I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much prospect that Mrs. Clinton will actually do that. But if by any chance she and those around her are tempted to take this recommendation seriously: Don\u2019t.And no, the program doesn\u2019t need to be more \u201cpro-growth.\u201dIt\u2019s true that there are things we could do to boost the U.S. economy. The most important of these things, however, would be to take advantage of very low government borrowing costs to greatly expand public investment \u2014 which is something progressives support but conservatives oppose. So enough already with the notion that being on the center-left somehow means being anti-growth.Now let\u2019s talk about the politics.The Trumpification of the G.O.P. didn\u2019t come out of nowhere. On the contrary, it was the natural outcome of a cynical strategy: long ago, conservatives decided to harness racial resentment to sell right-wing economic policies to working-class whites, especially in the South.This strategy brought many electoral victories, but always at the risk that the racial resentment would run out of control, leaving the economic conservatives \u2014 whose ideas never had much popular support \u2014 stranded. And that is what has just happened.So now the strategy that rightists had used to sell policies that were neither popular nor successful has blown up in their faces. And the Democratic response should be to adopt some of those policies? Say what?Also, I can\u2019t help but notice a curious pattern in the recommendations of some self-proclaimed centrists. When Republicans were in the ascendant, centrists urged Democrats to adapt by moving right. Now that Republicans are in trouble, with some feeling that they have no choice except to vote Democratic, these same centrists are urging Democrats to \u2026 adapt by moving right. Funny how that works.Back to the main theme: Grand coalitions do sometimes have a place in politics, as a response to crises that are neither party\u2019s fault \u2014 external threats to national security, economic disaster. But that\u2019s not what is happening here. Trumpism is basically a creation of the modern conservative movement, which used coded appeals to prejudice to make political gains, then found itself unable to rein in a candidate who skipped the coding.If some conservatives find this too much and bolt the party, good for them, and they should be welcomed into the coalition of the sane. But they can\u2019t expect policy concessions in return. When Dr. Frankenstein finally realizes that he has created a monster, he doesn\u2019t get a reward. Mrs. Clinton and her party should stay the course.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Once a Bucknell Professor, Now the Commander of an Ethiopian Rebel Army", "Date": "2016-08-31", "News": "FeatureWhy Berhanu Nega traded a tenured position for the chance to lead a revolutionary force against an oppressive regime.Supported byNega remained vague about his past. But students curious enough to Google him would discover that the man who stood before them, outlining development policies in sub-Saharan Africa, was in fact intimately involved in the long-running hostility between Ethiopia and neighboring Eritrea, a conflict that has dragged on for half a century. By the start of the millennium, its newest incarnation, a border war over a patch of seemingly worthless ground just 250 square miles in size, devolved into a tense standoff, with the two nations each massing along the border thousands of troops from both official and unofficial armies. One proxy army fighting on the Eritrean side, a group of disaffected Ethiopians called Ginbot 7, was a force that Nega helped create, founding the movement in 2008 with another Ethiopian exile, Andargachew Tsege, in Washington. The Ethiopian government, which had previously detained Nega as a political prisoner for two years in Addis Ababa, now sentenced him to death in absentia. Bucknell students who did learn about their teacher\u2019s past were thrilled. \u201cIt made his classes exciting,\u201d Rickard says.In Ginbot 7, Tsege served as the political leader based in Eritrea; Nega was the group\u2019s intellectual leader and principal fund-raiser, collecting money from members of the Ethiopian diaspora in Europe and the United States. That all changed one day in June 2014, when Tsege, known to everyone as Andy, made a brief stopover in Sanaa, the capital of Yemen, on his way to Asmara, the capital of Eritrea. As he sat in the airport transit lounge, waiting to board his flight, Yemeni security forces, apparently acting in collusion with Ethiopian intelligence, arrested him and put him on a plane to Addis Ababa, where he was paraded on state television and currently faces a death sentence.Days after Tsege\u2019s arrest and extradition, Nega volunteered to replace him in Eritrea. \u201cWas I going to remain an academic, sitting in an ivory tower criticizing things?\u201d he told me. \u201cOr was I going to do something as an engaged citizen?\u201d Nega put his house up for sale and took an indefinite leave of absence from the university. It was an extended sabbatical, he told his colleagues. Only a handful of close friends, his wife and his two sons knew the truth.\u201cThey\u2019ve got documents, and they insist on handing them over only to me,\u201d Nega told me. \u201cWhen there is sensitive material, they first want me to see it and then filter the information to the rest of the organization.\u201d Nega, a burly, balding 58-year-old with a rumpled facade and an appealingly unassuming manner, rubbed his forehead as the lights flickered and then returned. In recent years, Ginbot 7 has grown, and it is now guided by an 80-member council of representatives spread around the world. As commander, Nega oversees several hundred rebel fighters in Eritrea as well as an unknown number of armed members inside Ethiopia who carry out occasional attacks in the movement\u2019s name. During his frequent visits to the front lines, he spends his time meeting with fellow commanders, observing training and \u2014 ever the professor \u2014 leading history and democracy seminars using chalk and a blackboard in a \u201cclassroom\u201d in the bush.Nega turned back to the map and traced a straight line leading to the Tekeze River, the westernmost border between Ethiopia and Eritrea. The stream was a main crossing point for Ethiopian Army deserters fleeing to the rebels, and in recent weeks it had come under threat from advancing Ethiopian troops. \u201cThey are moving a sizable force into this area, because we are their main target now,\u201d he said, referring to Ginbot 7, now known as Patriotic Ginbot 7. \u201cAnd they are pushing a large part of their army, artillery and tanks into this zone. They haven\u2019t started shelling us yet.\u201dThe two nations, now ferocious enemies, were once joined. Eritrea, an Italian colony from 1890 until 1941, was annexed by Ethiopia after World War II; it took a three-decades-long war for the Eritreans to finally liberate themselves, in 1991. The neighbors remained at peace until 1998, when a simmering dispute over the Yirga triangle, a piece of rocky land along the border that had never been clearly demarcated in colonial maps, exploded into two years of tank and trench warfare in which 100,000 died. Today, despite a United Nations-supervised mediation that awarded the disputed territory to Eritrea, Ethiopia continues to occupy the border village Badame. Tens of thousands of troops face each other across a landscape of mines, bunkers, sniper posts and other fortifications.Violence on the border, while infrequent, can be both sudden and brutal. In mid-June, according to the Eritrean government, Ethiopia launched a full-scale attack along the frontier at Tsorona, the first major incursion since 2012, possibly in retaliation for attacks on its forces by Ginbot 7. Eritrea claimed that it had killed 200 enemy soldiers and wounded 300, though Ethiopia downplayed its losses. \u201cThey almost always deny it,\u201d Nega told me. \u201cAs far as the Ethiopian government is concerned, nobody ever dies.\u201dEthiopia, while an American ally and an economic leader by African standards, is notoriously repressive. The minority Tigrayan regime has jailed hundreds of bloggers, journalists and opposition figures, keeping itself in power by intimidating political opponents, rigging elections and violently putting down protests. Since November of last year, according to Human Rights Watch, state security forces killed more than 400 protesters in the Oromia region, which surrounds Addis Ababa. Protests have recently spread to the Amhara region, as well; in August, security forces shot dead roughly 100 demonstrators and injured hundreds more. Thousands of Oromos, a minority group that makes up about a third of the population, have been jailed without trial on suspicion of supporting the Oromo Liberation Front, a secessionist group. The Ethiopian marathoner Feyisa Lilesa, who won the silver medal at the Olympics this year, drew global attention to the government\u2019s abuses when he held his crossed arms over his head at the finish line in solidarity with his fellow Oromos; he says he fears returning home and is seeking political asylum.The house also serves as an infirmary for rebels who become ill or are wounded in combat, and it provides a temporary sanctuary for Ethiopian Army defectors who cross the front lines. One recent arrival was a former Ethiopian Air Force officer, an Oromo who had traveled north 42 hours by bus and on foot, then swum across the Tekeze River to Eritrea. He made the decision to defect while sitting in an Addis Ababa jail cell on \u201cfalse charges,\u201d he told me, of being a member of the Oromo secessionist movement.\u201cWe have many like him,\u201d Nega said.Nega put on his jacket to head off in search of diesel fuel for the morning journey to the border. With another rebel comrade from Virginia, we drove down the deserted, lightless streets of Asmara, searching for an open filling station, but the one we found had run out of diesel; Nega would have to return the next morning, delaying his departure for the front lines. When we returned to his home, Nega pointed to a pile of medical supplies in the hallway \u2014 bandages, splints, antibiotics, antimalarials \u2014 that he was planning to ferry to his fighters, and three cardboard boxes packed with solar cells that would provide some rudimentary electricity in the bush. While in the camps, Nega was dependent on his mobile phone for contact with the outside world, but even that was not guaranteed. \u201cThey have shut off phone coverage since the incursion\u201d by the Ethiopians at Tsorona, he told me. \u201cI\u2019ll be out of touch for days.\u201dWe met over Memorial Day weekend on the terrace of the upscale Caf\u00e9 Dupont on Dupont Circle in Washington, joined by his sister Hiwot, who runs a technology start-up in New York, and Iyassu, a 21-year-old former high-school track star who was starting work at a New York investment bank in the fall. Over white wine and chicken salad, the conversation touched on Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s commencement address and Nega\u2019s excitement over crossing paths, after the ceremony, with Donald Trump and Vice President Joe Biden. (Trump\u2019s daughter and Biden\u2019s granddaughter were members of Iyassu\u2019s graduating class.) I asked Iyassu if he had reconciled himself to the idea of his father\u2019s new life on the front lines, and he said that he had. \u201cUltimately he should continue to pursue what he believes in,\u201d he told me. He expressed little interest, though, in visiting his father at his Eritrean rebel camp or delving deeper into the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the Ginbot 7 movement. \u201cI just got out of college \u2014 my life has its own direction,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t take time off. ... I\u2019m a little bit removed generationally as well.\u201dThe elder Nega is part of a generation of Ethiopians who grew up amid violence and tumult. Over lunch, he recalled what it was like to be a high-school student when a Marxist junta, the Soviet-backed Derg, overthrew Emperor Haile Selassie and ushered in a brutal dictatorship. Nega had grown up privileged, the son of a wealthy entrepreneur, and he watched as his father\u2019s vast commercial corn and soybean farms were seized and security forces began arresting, imprisoning and executing thousands of dissidents, including many students. He and his two older sisters joined a resistance movement called the Ethiopian People\u2019s Revolutionary Party (E.P.R.P.). They went underground, living in safe houses, eluding the police. His eldest sister was later captured and disappeared in the Derg\u2019s prisons. His family searched for her everywhere.\u201cWe had people coming to our house and telling my parents, \u2018I saw her at this place.\u2019 My mother used to go out all over looking for her,\u201d Nega recalls. Her former cellmates later told him that she had died in prison, probably by committing suicide with a cyanide capsule that she wore around her neck. \u201cIt was common to have cyanide with you because if you were caught, you would be tortured and executed, and through torture you might be forced to betray people,\u201d Nega said. As the crackdown in Addis intensified, the E.P.R.P. sent Nega north to Tigray province, the center of a growing guerrilla war against the Derg; there, he carried out attacks on government forces. In 1978 a power struggle erupted within the E.P.R.P. leadership, and Nega was thrown into prison. He was released one day before guards turned their guns on the remaining prisoners, killing 15. Nega escaped to Sudan, living as a refugee in Khartoum for nearly two years, then obtained political asylum in the United States in 1980.He earned his bachelor\u2019s degree from the State University of New York at New Paltz, where he also played on the soccer team. While studying for his doctorate at the New School for Social Research, he lived in Brooklyn and wrote his dissertation on the failures of Ethiopian agriculture under the Communist regime. Meanwhile, Ethiopia was sliding deeper into calamity. When the guerrilla movements increased their attacks in Tigray in the mid-1980s, the Derg dictator, Mengistu Haile Mariam, blocked food supplies to the region, creating a devastating famine in which one million people died. Photographs of starving children, disseminated by the news media, catalyzed an international relief effort, Live Aid, and inspired the pop hit \u201cWe Are the World,\u201d making Ethiopia a worldwide synonym for hunger. The famine had wound down, and the rebel war was escalating, when Bucknell hired Nega as an assistant professor in 1990. \u201cHe never trumpeted his background, the fact that he had been a guerrilla fighter,\u201d says Dean Baker, a former Bucknell colleague who now heads the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington.In 1991, after a decade\u2019s struggle, three rebel groups \u2014 the Tigrayan People\u2019s Liberation Front, the Oromo Liberation Front and the Eritrean People\u2019s Liberation Front \u2014 defeated the Derg and marched into Addis Ababa. The new government, led by the Tigrayan rebel leader Meles Zenawi, set about rebuilding the war-shattered nation. Nega finally had reason for optimism. He knew Meles well \u2014 the prime minister had been in the same university class as his dead sister \u2014 and after the Tigrayans consolidated power, Nega obtained a leave of absence from Bucknell and flew with his wife and two sons, both toddlers, back to Addis, determined to help rebuild the country. Nega believed that Meles \u201chad good intentions,\u201d he told me.But Nega\u2019s enthusiasm for the new government wore off quickly. At Addis Ababa University, where he taught part-time (he had also taken over several of his father\u2019s businesses), administrators cracked down on dissent, banning the student government and the school newspaper. When Nega encouraged his students to press for academic freedoms, police assaulted them and other demonstrators; later, as unrest spread through the city, they shot 41 people dead. Nega spent a month in jail for abetting the protests. \u201cAt night I was hearing prisoners being tortured, beaten,\u201d he says.In May 2005, with the economy growing rapidly and the government\u2019s popularity appar\u00adently high, Ethiopia held elections, the first truly multiparty vote in Ethiopia\u2019s history, and invited international observers to attend. But the results were not to Meles\u2019s liking. Nega\u2019s Coalition for Unity and Democracy won 137 of the 138 seats on the City Council in Addis Ababa. Nega was poised to become mayor, but the government denied his party the victory and jailed him along with other C.U.D. leaders. American colleagues began a campaign to free Nega. \u201cThe Bucknell faculty approved a motion to support him and call attention to his plight,\u201d Rickard says. \u201cWe talked with journalists, ambassadors, trying to make sure that he stayed on the front burner.\u201d International pressure helped to secure Nega\u2019s release after 21 months, and he returned to the United States. The experience \u201chardened him,\u201d says Samuel Adamassu, a member of the Ethio\u00adpian diaspora who has known Nega and his family since the 1980s. \u201cIt made him realize these people are not willing to change without being forced.\u201dWhen Nega helped found the Ginbot 7 movement in 2008, the year he returned to teaching at Bucknell, he explained that the movement would seek to \u201corganize civil disobedience and help the existing armed movements\u201d inside and outside Ethiopia and \u201cput pressure on the government, and the international community, to come to a negotiation.\u201d Yet the Ginbot 7 platform advocated destabilizing the government \u201cby any means necessary,\u201d including attacks on soldiers and police. It was a discordant message coming out of a liberal American university whose first class was held in the basement of the First Baptist Church of Lewisburg in 1846. \u201cIt\u2019s a line that he has crossed,\u201d says Rickard, the English professor, who finds Nega\u2019s advocacy of violence \u201ctroubling\u201d but understandable. \u201cHe has never been a pacifist, never renounced armed struggle,\u201d he says. \u201cHe has seen elections overturned, hundreds of people murdered on the streets. His sister died, and his best friend is in prison, in peril of his life. He sees violence as viable and necessary. It\u2019s kind of shocking, in a way.\u201dWhile Ginbot 7 started to foment its resistance, Ethiopia was busy rebranding itself as an economic success story. Following South Korean and Chinese models of state-directed development, Meles borrowed from state-owned banks and used Western aid money to invest heavily in dams, airlines, agriculture, education and health care. Ethiopia\u2019s economy took off, averaging nearly 11 percent growth per year for the last decade, one of the highest rates in Africa. Addis Ababa became the showpiece of the country\u2019s transformation, with a light rail system, ubiquitous high-rise construction and luxury hotels, high-end restaurants and wine bars packed with newly minted millionaires. At the same time, the country was becoming a bulwark against the spread of radical Islam in the Horn of Africa. Today Ethiopia provides 4,400 peacekeepers to an African Union force in Somalia and helps keep the peace along the tense border between North and South Sudan. In July 2015 President Obama, on an African tour, paid the first visit ever to Ethiopia by a sitting American president.Yet in the classroom and abroad, Nega argued that Ethiopia\u2019s transformation was a mirage, created to placate Western observers troubled by the lack of democracy. \u201cIn 2005, it became clear that legitimacy would not come through the political process, so they started this new narrative \u2014 development,\u201d he told me. Nega insists that Ethiopia has \u201ccooked the books,\u201d and that its growth rate is largely attributable to huge infrastructure projects and Western development aid, with little contribution from the private sector. \u201cThe World Bank is throwing money at Ethiopia like there\u2019s no tomorrow,\u201d he told me. The actual growth rate, he insists, is closer to 5 to 6 percent \u2014 per capita income is still among the lowest in the world \u2014 and the weakness of the country\u2019s institutions will mean that even this rate cannot be sustained.Two months before Obama arrived, the government presided over what was widely considered a sham election, in which the ruling party won all 547 seats in Parliament, But Obama, making it clear that security trumped other concerns in the Horn of Africa, stood beside Meles\u2019s successor, Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn, and described the government as being \u201cdemocratically elected.\u201d\u201cI was shocked,\u201d Nega told me. \u201c I understand the reality of power and why he supports the Ethiopian government, but to say it is \u2018democratically elected\u2019? I was disgusted.\u201dImmediately following its independence in the early 1990s, under the rebel-leader-turned-president Isaias Afwerki, Eritrea was briefly considered one of the hopes of Africa. When I visited the country in 1996, five years after it won its liberation from Ethiopia, the former rebels were starting to revive the wrecked economy \u2014 rebuilding roads, bridges and a railway to the coast, calling on the Eritrean diaspora to invest. But after the border war between 1998 and 2000, Eritrea\u2019s leadership turned inward, growing increasingly suspicious of the outside world. Afwerki suppressed dissent, expelled Western journalists and NGOs, turned down foreign aid, nationalized industries and discouraged foreign investment; according to the World Bank, per capita income is about $1,400 a year. In 2009 the United Nations Security Council imposed sanctions on Eritrea, including an arms em\u00adbargo and a travel ban and a freeze on the assets of top Eritrean officials, for providing weapons to the Shabab, the radical Islamist group that has carried out hundreds of terrorist attacks in Somalia and neighboring Kenya. (Eritrea called the allegation \u201cfabricated lies.\u201d) A June 2016 United Nations report accused the Eritrean government of committing \u201ccrimes against human\u00adity,\u201d including torture, jailing dissidents and the open-ended military conscription program that the government justifies as preparation against another Ethiopian invasion.With virtually no investment coming into the country, Asmara has become a city frozen in time. Two donkeys meandered down Harnet Avenue, the capital\u2019s main boulevard, stopping to nibble at a patch of grass around a palm tree. As we watched the crowds walk down the tidy avenue lined by an imposing red brick cathedral, a 1930s-era Art Deco movie theater and crumbling Italian bakeries and cappuccino bars, Nega defended his decision to turn to the dictatorship for support.\u201cDo we really have to discuss the kind of dictatorships that the U.S. sleeps with?\u201d he asked me. \u201cHere is a country that was willing to give us sanctuary, a country that had once been part of Ethiopia. I look at any of these people, I talk to them, and they are just like me, they are as Ethiopian as I am. Why should I not get help from them?\u201dNega insisted that he saw some positives in the dictatorship. \u201cThis is the only country that says, despite its poverty, \u2018We are going to chart our own course \u2014 whether you like it or not,\u2019\u2009\u201d he told me. \u201cThey are not corrupt. You see these government officials driving 1980s cars, torn down the middle. I have seen their lives, their houses. There is some element of a David-and-Goliath struggle in this thing.\u201d He called the United Nations report describing crimes against humanity an \u201cexaggeration.\u201d (A Western diplomat in Asmara I talked to, who asked not to be identified because of the political sensitivities of his position, agreed with Nega\u2019s assessment of the report, saying it was based on testimony of refugees in Europe who had \u201can interest in depicting their country as badly as possible to justify their status.\u201d)It goes without saying that Nega was reluctant to speak harshly about the nation that was providing his movement with a refuge \u2014 and that could snatch it away at any moment. \u201cI don\u2019t want to butt into their personal issues,\u201d he said carefully. \u201cThey\u2019ve always been nice to us.\u201d Out of the public eye, however, the rebel leader can be more critical. \u201cHe holds no illusions about Eritrea,\u201d says his friend and former Bucknell colleague Dean Baker.I asked Nega if he was confident that pressure by the rebel groups could bring down the Ethiopian government. Nega believed that momentum was on his side. \u201cThis resistance to the state is coming in every direction now, in all parts of the country,\u201d he said. He was giving himself \u201cfour or five years\u201d before he and his rebel forces entered Ethiopia as part of a new democratic dispensation. \u201cIt certainly won\u2019t be a decade,\u201d he told me.Until that happens, Nega will continue planning and preparing from a precarious and lonely limbo. Back at the bungalow, he led me down the corridor and showed me where he slept: a monastic chamber furnished with a single bed, an armoire and a night table strewn with jars of vitamins and blood-pressure medication. (He lost his medical insurance when he left Bucknell, but still has American insurance coverage through his wife, and he picked up a three-month supply of the medicine on his May trip to the United States.) He retrieved from the freezer a chilled bottle of Absolut and poured two glasses. We sat in the concrete courtyard, beside a clothesline draped with Nega\u2019s laundry. The power failed again, casting us into total darkness, then returned a few seconds later. The contrast with his previous life in the States \u2014 cheering for the Lewisburg Green Dragons, his son\u2019s high-school track team; vacationing on the beaches of Maryland and North Carolina with his extended family \u2014 could hardly have been more extreme.\u201cIf you like comfort, and that\u2019s what drives you, you\u2019ll never do this,\u201d he told me, taking a sip of the ice-cold vodka. \u201cBut sometimes you get really surprised. Once you have a commitment to something, all these things that you thought were normal in your day-to-day life become unnecessary luxuries.\u201dJoshua Hammer is a freelance foreign correspondent and the author of \u201cThe Bad-Ass Librarians of Timbuktu.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Obama has emphasized that the pact would expand American influence in the Asia-Pacific region as a counterweight to China, which is not part of the pact.Among those who will hit the road will be Secretary of State John F. Kerry; Secretary of Defense Ashton B. Carter; retired Admiral Michael G. Mullen, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Presidents George W. Bush and Obama; Admiral Harry B.

{"Headline": "In Michigan, Hillary Clinton Calls Donald Trump Enemy of \u2018the Little Guy\u2019", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWARREN, Mich. \u2014 In a full-throttled rejection of Donald J. Trump\u2019s economic policies, Hillary Clinton on Thursday accused him of feigning a connection to the working man, while advocating policies that would \u201cwork for him and his friends, at the expense of everyone else.\u201dSeeking to chip away at the perception among working-class white voters that Mr. Trump is the economic populist in the race, Mrs. Clinton said the Republican nominee merely paid \u201clip service\u201d to being on the side of average Americans. She repeatedly contrasted his personal wealth with her own middle-class upbringing.\u201cThere is a myth out there that he\u2019ll stick it to the rich and powerful because, somehow, at heart, he\u2019s really on the side of the little guy,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cDon\u2019t believe it.\u201dMrs. Clinton referred to the tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations that Mr. Trump presented in a speech in Detroit on Monday, saying he \u201cwants to give trillions in tax breaks to people like himself,\u201d which would lead to broad cuts in spending on education, health care and environmental protection.Although she has attacked Mr. Trump\u2019s business record for months, her address on Thursday presented the first opportunity for Mrs. Clinton to deliver a detailed point-by-point rebuttal to the economic proposals Mr. Trump unveiled this week.The nearly back-to-back addresses on the economy put into sharp relief the candidates\u2019 contrasting positions on an issue that has preoccupied voters throughout the lengthy presidential contest, with Mr. Trump seizing on economic dislocation in mixing populist anti-trade positions with traditionally Republican tax cutting, and Mrs. Clinton seeing a strong government hand in creating jobs and driving up wages.Mrs. Clinton called for making the biggest infrastructure investment \u2014 $275 billion \u2014 since World War II, and urged aggressive spending on green energy to counter China and Germany. And she repeated her plans to make public colleges and universities tuition-free for in-state middle-class families.And she sharply criticized important elements of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cut plans, particularly the elimination of the estate tax and his plan to cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent; she said his plan for business owners included what she called the \u201cTrump loophole,\u201d which would \u201callow him to pay less than half the current tax rate on income from many of his own companies.\u201dShe characterized her opponent\u2019s economic doctrine as a \u201cmore extreme version of the failed theory of trickle-down economics\u201d mixed with his own \u201coutlandish Trumpian ideas that even Republicans reject.\u201dAnd she rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s promises to ease financial regulation and do away with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which he calls detrimental to average Americans.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s remarks often transcended policy, as she sought to portray Mr. Trump as an out-of-touch businessman who would squash the working class. She talked about her grandfather\u2019s years of labor in a lace mill in Scranton, Pa., and her father\u2019s small drapery-printing business in Chicago.\u201cThis is personal for me,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cI am the product of the American middle class.\u201dBut for all of her efforts, Mr. Trump remains a difficult opponent to critique in traditional ideological terms. Although some of his policies align with those of congressional Republicans, others, like his promise to rip up global trade agreements, break with Republican orthodoxy.And unlike Mitt Romney, whom President Obama effectively portrayed as a cold corporate titan in the 2012 race, Mr. Trump enjoys some of his strongest support among working-class white voters who believe he cares about people like them.The Upshot\u2019s presidential forecast, updated daily.The issue of trade particularly hurt Mrs. Clinton in the primary in Michigan, which is heavily reliant on manufacturing jobs. She narrowly lost the state to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who, like Mr. Trump, sharply criticized Mrs. Clinton for her previous support for the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, which her husband signed into law, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which she supported as secretary of state.Before Mrs. Clinton\u2019s speech, Mr. Trump used an address to the National Association of Home Builders in Miami Beach to assail former President Bill Clinton for signing Nafta into law, which Mr. Trump said devastated upstate New York, and he hammered Mrs. Clinton for failing to deliver on a promise she made in her 2000 Senate campaign to bring 200,000 jobs to the state.\u201cShe passed no legislation that helped,\u201d he said. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t get out of her own way.\u201dMrs. Clinton gave her address after touring the Futuramic Tool & Engineering factory in Warren, which made automotive parts in the past but has diversified to supply parts to the aerospace industry. Praising the company for being at the front line of a potential \u201cmanufacturing renaissance,\u201d Mrs. Clinton criticized Mr. Trump for taking a dark view of America\u2019s potential.\u201cWhen Donald Trump visited Detroit on Monday, he talked only of failure, poverty and crime,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s missing so much.\u201dMrs. Clinton has spent over a year explaining her main economic proposals and did not propose anything new on Thursday. But she did contrast her specific promises with those Mr. Trump offered on Monday.She mocked Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to give tax breaks for child care \u2014 the brainchild of his daughter Ivanka and intended to appeal to middle-class mothers \u2014 as a boon to rich families with nannies. And, in contrast to Mr. Trump\u2019s corporate tax reductions, she said she would impose an \u201cexit tax\u201d to penalize companies that move jobs overseas and offer tax incentives to companies that share profits with employees.\u201cThen there\u2019s the estate tax, which Trump wants to eliminate altogether,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you believe that he\u2019s as wealthy as he says, that alone would save the Trump family $4 billion.\u201dBut on one issue that has resonated with working-class voters, Mrs. Clinton played defense on Thursday.Halfway through the speech, she paused. The crowd grew quiet. \u201cI\u2019m sure some of you are thinking, well, that all sounds good, but what about trade?\u201d she said. \u201cAfter all, Trump talks about it all the time.\u201dWhile reiterating her opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, she belittled Mr. Trump\u2019s tough talk on trade as empty, noting how he makes Trump-branded products overseas. \u201cBefore he tweets about how he\u2019s really one who\u2019ll put \u2018America First\u2019 in trade, let\u2019s remember where Trump makes many of his own products,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause it is sure not America.\u201dOutside the factory setting, a scattering of pro-Trump protesters held \u201cHillary for Prison\u201d signs and criticized Mrs. Clinton\u2019s connections to Wall Street. And more than 1,000 miles away in Florida, Mr. Trump echoed that critique.\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have the talent\u201d to jump-start the economy, Mr. Trump said. \u201cIf she wanted to do it, she couldn\u2019t because her donors won\u2019t let her.\u201d\u201cMany workers are earning less money in real dollars than they were in 1970,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd then you wonder why they\u2019re angry.\u201dIn her speech, Mrs. Clinton tried to address voters\u2019 anger over income inequality, but she also tried to frame her plans as the optimistic flip side of Mr. Trump\u2019s pessimistic assessment of the country\u2019s economic prospects, pointing to two Olympic gold medalists.\u201cIf Team U.S.A. was as fearful as Trump,\u201d she said, \u201cMichael Phelps and Simone Biles would be cowering in the locker room.\u201dAmy Chozick reported from Warren, and Alan Rappeport from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japan Announces More Stimulus Measures as Economy Struggles", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 In the three and a half years since he won the Japanese prime minister\u2019s office on a pledge to rekindle economic growth, Shinzo Abe has tried many tactics to coax the economy into expanding.He persuaded the central bank to flood the country with cheap money. He sanctioned a sharp fall in the value of the yen, a boon for big exporters like Toyota and Panasonic. And he increased government spending, pouring cash into areas as varied as day care and defense.The result has been well short of the renaissance Mr. Abe promised. Now his government is embarking on what may be its biggest spending program yet.On Tuesday, the government detailed a package of financial measures that it said was worth 28 trillion yen, or $274 billion, equal to more than 5 percent of Japan\u2019s gross domestic product. Economists immediately began debating its impact, with many arguing that the jolt it would give to growth would be much smaller than the headline number suggests.\u201cWe\u2019ve put together a bold stimulus proposal that is an investment in the future,\u201d Mr. Abe said on Tuesday. It will allocate money to social programs and infrastructure, including the construction of a high-speed train that will use magnetic levitation, or maglev, technology to float above its tracks.The central bank\u2019s policies have let the government borrow at extremely low interest rates. Some economists saw the latest increase in spending as a sign that Mr. Abe is in effect assuming that the bank will underwrite government spending more directly in the future \u2014 an approach sometimes called helicopter money because it essentially drops money into the public\u2019s hands.\u201cWhile helicopter money is a concept still frowned upon thus far, such coordination does make the first step in blurring the line as central banks run out of stimulus measures,\u201d said Lee Jin-Yang, an analyst at Aberdeen Asset Management.Mr. Lee and other economists noted that the stimulus contains only \u00a57.5 trillion in new government spending, and that the money would be doled out on an uncertain timetable. The rest of the program takes the form of low-interest loans and financial guarantees, which can help stimulate economic activity but do not contribute nearly as directly to growth.The government estimated that the stimulus would increase gross domestic product by 1.3 percent, though it did not say over what length of time.About \u00a53.5 trillion will be spent on social items like wage subsidies for people who leave work to care for children or aging relatives. But more will be spent on infrastructure, including the maglev train, which the government wants to help build between Tokyo and Osaka by as early as 2037, eight years earlier than a previous timetable.Mr. Abe is not only betting that Japan can spend its way to growth, but that economic expansion will help the country claw its way out of a canyon of debt. Japan\u2019s government debt is bigger than that of any other country, relative to the size of its economy. Mr. Abe argues that things will only get worse if output keeps shrinking, so spending more now will make Japan financially stronger down the line.In June, he announced that he would delay a planned increase in the national sales tax by two and a half years \u2014 another decision that prioritized growth over an immediate fix for the deficit.The approach has its critics. Some economists argue that the government would be better served by focusing on deregulation and other structural changes that would make the economy more competitive. Others fear a repeat of the 1990s, when the government spent heavily on public works without much of a return.\u201cThere were temporary pickups in the economy,\u201d wrote Makoto Hara, an economics commentator at the Asahi Shimbun newspaper, \u201cbut in the end we were left with ballooning government debt and two lost decades.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But mostly, they\u2019re not coming from your air-conditioner, though air-conditioning poses other environmental problems. So we\u2019re here to answer some questions you might have about HFCs, air-conditioning and this new treaty.It\u2019s complicated.HFCs represent a small portion of total greenhouse gas emissions, but they trap thousands of times as much heat in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide.The United States has also put regulations in place to phase out the use of HFCs in other areas like aerosols and building foam.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.The United States, which already has some regulations in place to limit HFCs, wants to begin phasing out production and use in 2019 in developed countries, and in 2021 in developing countries, though some developing countries, like India, would prefer a longer time-frame \u2014 beginning in 15 years. These restrictions, they say, would place an unfair economic burden on their citizens, especially as air-conditioning use is expected to skyrocket there in the next few decades.And several companies are already working on cooling replacements for HFCs.For instance, Honeywell, which makes your dehumidifier but also plane engines, has already invested close to a billion dollars in developing and patenting an HFC substitute, which is already used by some manufacturers.According to Ken Gayer, a vice president at Honeywell, these new molecules, known as HFOs (hydrofluoroolefins), break down in a matter of days, so there\u2019s less time for them to trap heat in the atmosphere.HFOs are as good at cooling your home and are more energy efficient, Mr. Gayer said, but they are more expensive and complicated to produce.Honeywell started working on the HFOs in the 1990s, after scientists knew that HFCs were contributing to global warming, he said, adding that HFCs were always meant to be a transitional chemical, and not meant for long-term use.An earlier version of this article misstated a type of appliance Honeywell makes. They make a variety of home appliances, they do not make dishwashers.Advertisement"}

Under President Obama, the United States had been eager to establish formal trade agreements with five of the nations involved \u2014 Japan, Malaysia, Brunei, New Zealand and Vietnam \u2014 and to strengthen Nafta, its current agreement with Canada and Mexico.Moreover, as efforts at global trade deals have faltered (such as the World Trade Organization\u2019s Doha round), the Trans-Pacific Partnership was billed as an \u201copen architecture\u201d document written to ease adoption by additional Asian nations, and to provide a potential template to other initiatives underway, like the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.Today, the United States and most developed countries have few tariffs, but some remain. The United States, for example, protects the domestic sugar market from lower-priced global suppliers and imposes tariffs on imported shoes, while Japan has steep surcharges on agricultural products including rice, beef and dairy. The pact was an effort to create a Pacific Rim free-trade zone. Nafta, signed by President Bill Clinton in 1993, helped lead to a boom in trade among the United States, Mexico and Canada. All three countries exported more goods and services to the other two, cross-border investments grew, and the United States economy has added millions of jobs since then. But of course not all those trends were attributable to Nafta, and the benefits were not equal: The United States had a small trade surplus with Mexico when the pact was signed, but that quickly became a trade deficit that has widened to more than $50 billion a year.Critics of Nafta also point out that job growth in the United States does not account for the loss of jobs to Mexico or Canada; the A.F.L.-C.I.O. contends about 700,000 United States jobs have been lost or displaced because of Nafta.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Police in Zimbabwe Hit Protesters With Batons, Tear Gas and Water Cannons", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDespite a last-minute court order allowing the demonstration to proceed, the police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse a crowd of hundreds from a square in Harare, beating protesters with batons.Protesters left the square and ran into the central business district, some throwing stones at the police. Though the demonstration was organized by about 20 opposition parties and led by supporters, many ordinary Zimbabweans also joined the protest.\u201cI was beaten by the police here exercising my constitutional right, beaten with baton sticks by a horde of around 10 police officers,\u201d said Jonathan Malindati, 39, a jobless man who stood near the square, bleeding from his head and displaying baton marks on his back.\u201cPolice must safeguard the Constitution, which permits us to demonstrate,\u201d he added. \u201cThey must not be sent to fight us by Mugabe.\u201dAs the government has run short of cash, it has delayed paychecks to the military and the police for two consecutive months, and has struggled to pay other civil servants.Tambudzai Jabangwe, a 68-year-old widow, shouted at anti-riot police officers for protecting a government that was destroying jobs for the country\u2019s children. \u201cYou are cruel, you have no heart,\u201d she yelled before being chased from the square.Later, Ms. Jabangwe said she had taken a bus from her home into the city to participate in the protest.\u201cI am fighting for my grandchildren, who are educated but unemployed because of Mugabe who has shut down everything, every industry,\u201d she said.Amid the turmoil of the protest, rumors spread on social media that Mr. Mugabe had fled the country. But the state media reported that he had left to attend a previously scheduled summit meeting in Kenya between African nations and Japan.About 20 opposition parties participated in Friday\u2019s demonstration, led by Mr. Tsvangirai\u2019s Movement for Democratic Change and Ms. Mujuru\u2019s Zimbabwe People First. The united front came after months of negotiations between Mr. Tsvangirai, who once served as prime minister in a tense unity government with Mr. Mugabe after disputed elections, and Ms. Mujuru, who served for a decade as Mr. Mugabe\u2019s vice president until she and many of her allies were expelled in 2014 from ZANU-PF.In a bid to unseat Mr. Mugabe in the 2018 elections, Ms. Mujuru formed her own party early this year, surrounding herself with former ZANU-PF members. Though Ms. Mujuru was in Mr. Mugabe\u2019s inner circle for decades, she was not considered a party hard-liner and was known for being comparatively open to the opposition, including Mr. Tsvangirai.Ms. Mujuru\u2019s pledge to challenge Mr. Mugabe in the next election unsettled governing party officials, who have been fiercely attacking her character and credentials in recent months. Though her party lacks the resources of her established rivals, she has been a well-known figure for decades in Zimbabwe, a famous freedom fighter known by her nom de guerre, Spill Blood.Pedzisai Ruhanya, a political analyst and director of the Zimbabwe Democracy Institute, a research group based in Harare, said that Ms. Mujuru would come in third behind Mr. Tsvangirai and Mr. Mugabe in a presidential election. But a partnership between Mr. Tsvangirai and Ms. Mujuru would magnify the threat to Mr. Mugabe.\u201cIt is important for Tsvangirai and Mujuru to unite,\u201d Mr. Ruhanya said. \u201cMujuru will eat massively in Mugabe\u2019s electoral base at any given election.\u201dMs. Mujuru and her allies enjoy wide networks of supporters in rural Zimbabwe, Mr. Mugabe\u2019s traditional stronghold. By contrast, Mr. Tsvangirai has always been strongest in Harare and in other cities.In recent months, Ms. Mujuru and Mr. Tsvangirai have held several private meetings and then made their first joint appearance at a rally two weeks ago in Gweru, a city in central Zimbabwe. The nation\u2019s opposition parties have a long fractured history \u2014 one that Mr. Mugabe has skillfully exploited \u2014 but opposition officials say that the two leaders\u2019 rapprochement could be a step toward a more formal union ahead of the 2018 elections.\u201cOur people have demonstrated and demonstrated in a very big way when we held a joint rally in Gweru that they want us to work together,\u201d said Jealousy Mawarire, a spokesman for Ms. Mujuru\u2019s Zimbabwe People First party, adding, \u201cIf we don\u2019t work together as leaders, we run the risk of being left behind by the people.\u201dLovemore Chinoputsa, the secretary general of the youth wing of Mr. Tsvangirai\u2019s Movement for Democratic Change, said that \u201ca coalition is a good initiative considering that we have been fighting an entrenched dictatorship that requires uniting forces to fight together.\u201dBut Douglas Mwonzora, the Movement for Democratic Change\u2019s secretary general, said that the two opposition parties were focused now on changing the electoral process to ensure fair elections.\u201cRegarding the modalities of how we are going to work together when it comes to the election, it is too early to tell,\u201d Mr. Mwonzora said. \u201cBut we are serious about working together.\u201dJeffrey Moyo reported from Harare, and Norimitsu Onishi from Johannesburg.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "'We Don\u2019t Need to Be Alone\u2019: A Political Shift Has Poland Assessing Its Values", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMemo From PolandWROCLAW, Poland \u2014 Mayor Rafal Dutkiewicz of Wroclaw has presided over city hall in the magnificent old center since 2002. As he watches Poland\u2019s politics take a rightward and nationalistic turn \u2014 a phenomenon playing out to varying degrees across much of Europe \u2014 Mr. Dutkiewicz, an early supporter of Solidarity, cites history ancient and modern to argue that Europe is good for Poland.\u201cIt makes everybody bigger,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to be alone \u2014 we are Europe.\u201dIn Poland, the biggest former Communist nation in the European Union and NATO, the question is whether the liberty and European identity that meant so much to those who toppled Communism carry the same value today. The question applies especially for young people with no memory of divided Europe and Soviet bloc oppression.The debate is playing out in various ways across the country. It has a special resonance in Wroclaw, a city of 630,000 that brims with tourists, Polish and foreign, and is home to more than 130,000 students. This year, it is a European capital of culture, a title bestowed by Brussels on one or two cities each year that brings publicity, hundreds of millions of euros in subsidies and scores of special events.Two stand out for the mayor. One is an exhibit honoring the city\u2019s former archbishop, Boleslaw Kominek, who in 1966 wrote a then-utopian vision of a federal Europe that would bring peace and prosperity and bury the bloodshed of the past.The second is the United Nations\u2019 designation of a local medieval script, the Book of Henrykow, as world heritage.Building history is important in Central Europe, the scene of so many shifts of fate and governance through the centuries. So the mayor likens the United Nations honor to an Oscar nomination for the manuscript, which he said was written mostly in Latin by a German monk who also penned the first sentence written in Polish: a remark from a Czech peasant to his Polish wife.That early multiculturalism is the essence of a city like Wroclaw, until 1945 perhaps better known by its German name, Breslau. It was one of the largest cities to undergo population exchange after World War II, with Germans expelled and Poles brought in.Krzysztof Mieszkowski, the director of Wroclaw\u2019s prominent avant-garde theater, is quite clear about where he sees Poland going and who is taking it there.He believes that Jaroslaw Kaczynski, head of the governing Law and Justice party, which won both presidential and parliamentary elections last year, \u201clikes authoritarian rule and is in love with dictatorship.\u201dMr. Mieszkowski, who is also an opposition lawmaker in Parliament, added, \u201cHe has always been dreaming about this.\u201dCritics inside and outside Poland say Mr. Kaczynski, who holds no elected office, and his camp have moved decisively to undo the constitutional court, curb the news media, make abortion harder to obtain, and fan a new chauvinism that could cause social conflict and hurt one of Europe\u2019s few vibrant economies.Already, Mr. Mieszkowski said, Poland \u201chas lost the thing that is most important for democracy, which is thinking about civil society.\u201dLike Prime Minister Viktor Orban in post-Communist Hungary, Mr. Kaczynski is depicted as a dictator by his foes. In the view of his many supporters, his government helps poorer Poles with welfare subsidies and is rediscovering vital national values when the notion of a united Europe seems more distant and less appealing.Like governments across Central and Eastern Europe, Poland\u2019s has been opposed to resettling substantial numbers of refugees from Syria and other poor and war-torn nations, another point of stress in its relations with Brussels.In some cases, toeing the new line in Warsaw has involved a sharp shift in standpoint. Mateusz Morawiecki, deputy prime minister and head of economic development, led the Polish operations of the Spanish bank Santander for eight years.Now, he is sounding the alarm about globalization, suggesting that Poland\u2019s growth is stagnating and that Poles are captives of uncontrollable foreign forces that have condemned them to worse wages and conditions than in Western Europe.\u201cWe have been in this model for 27 years,\u201d Mr. Morawiecki told the Rzeczpospolita newspaper, dating these developments back to 1989, when the Solidarity movement triumphed over Communism. \u201cAnd that is why we have reached the trap of medium development, the trap of low profit margin and the trap of dependent development,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are, to an enormous extent, dependent on foreigners.\u201dSimilarly, Ryszard Legutko, a deputy in the European Parliament for the Law and Justice party, said the European Union had lost political appeal and was passing unfair judgment on Poland because its government dared to defy European institutions.\u201cNowadays, when people say Europe, they do not mean Sophocles, or Descartes, or Bach, or Roman law,\u201d Mr. Legutko said in a telephone interview. \u201cWhat they mean is a very particular set of institutions,\u201d a self-perpetuating alphabet soup of bodies \u201cmore experienced in social engineering\u201d than groundbreaking thoughts.When he turned 90 in February, Mr. Stern sounded strong warnings about democracy, Donald J. Trump and Europe\u2019s slide rightward.\u201cI grew up with the death of a democracy,\u201d Mr. Stern told German television, \u201cand now I see democracy only in danger.\u201d\u201cDemocracy,\u201d he added, \u201cmust be defended.\u201dCertainly, Mr. Dutkiewicz concurred, but first it \u201cneeds to be built, as well.\u201dAcross town, Mr. Mieszkowski, the theater director, was more strident. \u201cPolish democrats fell asleep,\u201d he said. \u201cThey forget that democracy is something that needs to be cultivated.\u201dAlthough Mr. Mieszkowski\u2019s theater and its sellout performances show that Poland is no totalitarian society, he and others compared the present to George Orwell\u2019s novel \u201c1984.\u201d The book has special resonance in Poland because that actual year fell during the Communist suppression of Solidarity, just after two years of martial law.For Mr. Kaczynski\u2019s camp, the more salient date is 2010. That April, his twin brother, Lech, then president, was killed with 95 others when their plane crashed in Smolensk, Russia, en route to a memorial for the Polish military elites killed in the 1940 Katyn massacre.Two investigations have found the crash to be an accident. But the Kaczynski camp still sees a conspiracy by a menacing Russia. The resulting narrative of beleaguered Poland fending off foes to the Russian east and European west is \u201ca best seller,\u201d said a Warsaw media analyst, Jacek Wasilewski.In the heart of old Wroclaw, the head of the city\u2019s small Jewish community, Alexander Gleichgewicht, mulled today\u2019s turmoil and what it signifies for his 97-year-old father; his Norwegian wife, Bente Kahan; and their globe-trotting student children.Developments include the possibility that Poland will be treated as \u201ca second-class country\u201d where \u201ca radical element feels encouraged by the government,\u201d Mr. Gleichgewicht said. For now, he added, it is simply \u201ca time of ghosts, a time of redefinitions.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italian Banks Continue to Lend to Stagnant Companies as Debt Pile Mounts", "Date": "2016-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Italy, where two decades of economic stagnation have created a long line of barely breathing companies, Feltrinelli, one of the country\u2019s largest booksellers, stands out.Since 2012, the company has chalked up three consecutive years of losses totaling nearly 11 million euros ($12.4 million).Even so, late last year, Feltrinelli was able to secure a fresh \u20ac50 million line of credit from a syndicate that included two of Italy\u2019s largest banks, UniCredit and Intesa Sanpaolo, at an interest rate below what top-rated companies in Europe were paying.In recent weeks, Italian bank stocks, down 70 percent for the year, have rallied, buoyed by recent stress-test results and, for some, earnings that were better than expected.But with the International Monetary Fund estimating the size of Italy\u2019s bad loan pile to be \u20ac360 billion \u2014 or about a third of the total amount in the eurozone \u2014 economists contend that any improvement in the debt situation will be short-lived.At the heart of the problem, the research paper concludes, is a nexus of inert banks lending to inert companies that has kept a lid on the recovery of Italy\u2019s economy, the third largest among countries that use the euro. The bank-driven slowdown recalls the zombie lending cycle that Japan entered in the 1990s, leading to its own lost economic decade.Then, instead of biting the bullet and taking losses, large Japanese banks kept credit lines open to borrowers even when they had slight chance of making good on the loans.\u201cEurope has not learned anything from Japan \u2014 it has just repeated the same mistakes,\u201d said Tim Eisert, a German economist at Erasmus University in the Netherlands who participated in the study. \u201cMario Draghi may have saved the euro, but we still have undercapitalized banks in Europe.\u201dIn their report, the economists calculate that if European banks were subjected to a scrubbing similar to what United States banks experienced, they would need to raise \u20ac125 billion in new capital.At a time when investors across Europe have become deeply skeptical of investing in banks, and governments are loath to offer bailouts, achieving such a number borders on the impossible.Feltrinelli is just one example of a number of highly indebted Italian companies receiving loans at below-market interest rates over the last three years, a period when aggressive policies by the European Central Bank freed extra cash for European banks to dole out credit.Other companies cited in the paper include the clothing retailer Benetton, which has lost \u20ac240 million since 2012, yet also received a below-market-rate loan in that year, according to data collected by the economists.Massimiliano Tarantino, a public relations executive at Feltrinelli, said that the company had suffered during the recent crisis and was now shifting its strategy, making new investments in television, electronic publishing and book sales over the internet.In their paper, the researchers found that of the \u20ac540 billion in syndicated European Union loans that they tracked, 8 percent went to companies that they classified as zombie institutions.In Italy, however, the proportion of new loans that have gone to struggling companies like Feltrinelli over the last three years is much higher at 17 percent.In his speech, Mr. Stournaras said that 67 percent of the loans made to small and medium-size companies, the life blood of the Greek economy, were nonperforming, a statistic that explains in blunt terms why the Greek economy continues to stagnate.As with Greek banks, Italian banks are similarly exposed to small private companies, many of which have been hit hard by the sluggish economy.While such an amount, about 18 percent of total Italian loans outstanding, is certainly arresting, Italian government officials argue that sufficient steps have been taken to address the problem.They say that banks have set aside cash to cover nearly half of the loans and that all of the exposures are backed by sufficient collateral.They also point to the recent formation of a \u20ac4 billion fund that will buy some of the bad loans from the banks.Still, \u20ac4 billion does not rise to the level of a bazooka that would give the markets confidence. And as the I.M.F. report lays out, Italian banks are among the least profitable in Europe, which gives them little incentive to write off their loans, especially when there are tax incentives for bankers to not take such a step.Banks also have little incentive to pursue debtors in Italy\u2019s courts. The I.M.F. study says that liquidations of troubled Italian companies last, on average, eight years, with preferred creditors likely to claw back just 29 percent of their claim.So, instead of taking a hit, many Italian banks have decided to keep the liquidity flowing in the hope that a company might turn its fortunes around. But with growth averaging about 0.3 percent for the last two decades and now threatening to dip back into negative territory, a spate of corporate recoveries seems unlikely.And the lesson for global regulators is a powerful one, the economists involved in the study argue.Before using unconventional measures to inject cash into lending markets, central bankers must ensure that their large banks are sufficiently capitalized \u2014 as was the case in the United States, when one of the first steps regulators took was to force banks to increase their capital cushions. Without this extra layer of security, banks have little incentive to write down bad loans and focus on healthier companies.\u201cThese zombie loans are just bad for the economy,\u201d said Viral V. Acharya, one of the report\u2019s authors and a specialist in European debt at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business. \u201cThe problem is that Europe never injected capital into its banks like TARP in the U.S.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The experience of the nuclear deal, he said, \u201ctells us that taking this step would be a deadly poison and that the Americans\u2019 remarks cannot be trusted on any issue.\u201dAyatollah Khamenei\u2019s remarks may strengthen the hard-line conservative factions in the Iranian hierarchy and their hostility toward President Hassan Rouhani, who made achieving a nuclear agreement a central objective in his 2013 election campaign.While oil sales have increased, Mr. Rouhani\u2019s optimism about other expected dividends of the agreement \u2014 an end to Iran\u2019s isolation and a rush of foreign investment and economic growth \u2014 have yet to occur, imperiling his prospects for re-election next year.Despite the lifting of nuclear-related sanctions, Iran is still barred from using the United States\u2019 financial system because of many other prohibitions imposed after the break in relations more than three decades ago.Big European banks, wary of violating those prohibitions and already leery about doing business in Iran, have largely stayed away, frustrating Iranian officials.Secretary of State John Kerry, who played a critical role in reaching the nuclear agreement, has said the United States is working to ensure that all of the accord\u2019s provisions, including the relaxation of the sanctions, are enforced.But worries about the durability of the agreement have increased because of two other developments since it took effect: Britain\u2019s vote in June to leave the European Union, and the possibility that Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, could win the November election.The British vote has sent economic chills through the European Union, which may divert or delay European business ambitions in Iran. Mr. Trump has called the nuclear agreement a disaster, suggesting that he would seek to renegotiate it or withdraw American participation.Political analysts outside Iran called Ayatollah Khamenei\u2019s remarks his strongest criticism of the agreement to date. Some said they saw practical goals behind his bellicose words.\u201cHe is pressing the West to move more quickly on investing in Iran, so that Iranians feel the deal helping their economy,\u201d said Cliff Kupchan, the chairman of the Eurasia Group, a political risk consulting firm in Washington. \u201cBut Khamenei is also buying a political insurance policy on the off chance that his elites turn against the agreement, and that\u2019s a problem.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Ridership Soars, PATH Service Disruptions Cut Deep", "Date": "2016-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byScrambling through a crowd of frazzled commuters at a Lower Manhattan train station on a recent Saturday, Romany Saad navigated his limited options for getting to work, hoping he would not be late for the second weekend in a row.Mr. Saad\u2019s predicament was shared by many riders who have been forced to shift their routines because the PATH rail line that runs from northern New Jersey to the 33rd Street station in Midtown Manhattan has been shut down on weekends.Mr. Saad, who lives in Jersey City and works as a cook at a pizza restaurant on 32nd Street, resorted to taking a PATH train to the World Train Center, where he quickly grabbed a voucher for a shuttle bus from a PATH worker before walking several blocks in sweltering heat to take the bus north.\u201cIt takes me an extra half-hour,\u201d Mr. Saad, 36, said, extending his arms in frustration. The previous weekend, he tried transferring to a subway train from the World Trade Center, but delays and line changes caused him to arrive at work even later.\u201cIt\u2019s a hard time, but what can we do?\u201d he said.The suspension of trains from Hoboken, N.J., to Midtown, which will continue through Dec. 19, is necessary to accommodate service upgrades and the installation of safety devices mandated by the federal government, PATH officials said. Trains stop running each Saturday at 12:10 a.m. and resume each Monday at 5 a.m., excluding some holidays.The shutdown comes at a time when PATH ridership levels are soaring. In June, ridership reached its highest monthly total ever with nearly seven million passengers in the system \u2014 a 3.6 percent increase over June of last year, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which has operated PATH since 1962. The system was first opened in 1908 by the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad.In addition, average Saturday ridership through June rose 2.2 percent compared with the same period last year.\u201cThe economy is good, jobs are there, people are taking the system,\u201d said Mike Marino, PATH\u2019s director and general manager.Veronica Vanterpool, the executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, an advocacy group focused on reducing the use of cars, attributes much of the increase in PATH ridership to the migration of New Yorkers to places where they can find more affordable housing but still commute into the city.\u201cPATH is a really vital artery of transportation between New Jersey and New York,\u201d Ms. Vanterpool said. The weekend suspension, she added, is \u201cone of those inconveniences that riders are just going to have to deal with.\u201dTo give an alternative for disrupted commuters, the PATH is providing direct train service between Hoboken and the World Trade Center on weekends. It is also offering vouchers for free shuttle bus service along Avenue of the Americas, from the World Trade Center to West 29th Street.The PATH will also replace an outdated method of monitoring a train\u2019s whereabouts with an operating system called communications-based train control. Officials say the system will use track sensors and computers to locate trains, allowing them to run more frequently and resulting in shorter wait times and increased passenger capacity.But for travelers from New Jersey, the disruptions on the 33rd Street line are crippling. Many commuters said the shuttle bus alternative takes too long, and transferring to a subway line from the PATH would double their fare. Others are choosing to change their schedules and weekend plans altogether in order to avoid the longer commute.Angela Cooper, 60, of Jersey City, took a PATH train to the World Trade Center before riding the shuttle bus to Midtown, where she planned to run some errands. But the walk from the station to the bus would have been too much for her husband, who is 75, so he decided to stay home, she said.And for Ms. Cooper\u2019s 22-year-old daughter, who works at a restaurant on 21st Street in Manhattan, the service suspension would lengthen her trip home at night. Feeling unsafe with the alternative, her daughter decided to change her schedule so she no longer has to work on Saturdays, Ms. Cooper said.For some commuters, like Ofelia Radecki, 42, the changes are welcome because of the addition of weekend train service between Hoboken and the World Trade Center. Ms. Radecki works as a housekeeper at the New York Marriot Downtown, a five-minute walk away from the World Trade Center station. Before the service changes, she would have to take a train from Hoboken to Grove Street in Jersey City, and transfer to a different line to the World Trade Center.\u201cIt\u2019s good because now I have more time at home, taking care of my son,\u201d said Ms. Radecki, whose son is 11 months old.Despite abundant signs in English and Spanish warning of the service changes and staff members at stations answering questions, some riders have still been caught off guard.In a sizzling underground PATH station in Hoboken on a recent Saturday, Ana Novas, 50, sat waiting for a train that would never arrive. Ms. Novas, a native of the Dominican Republic who lives in Union City, had planned to take a train to go shopping in Midtown.After waiting for a while, she was told of the service disruption. With her limited English, Ms. Novas could not understand a PATH employee\u2019s directions on how to adjust her commute and said she felt insecure navigating a new route on her own.She decided to leave the station in search of a familiar bus route into Manhattan.\u201cOh my God,\u201d Ms. Novas said. \u201cI have to change everything.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazil\u2019s Uplifting Olympics", "Date": "2016-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen I was a correspondent in Brazil 30 years ago, inflation was rampant. It ran at an average of 707.4 percent a year from 1985 to 1989. The salaries of the poor were wiped out within hours of being paid. The country went through three currencies \u2014 cruzeiro, cruzado and cruzado novo \u2014 while I lived in Rio. The only way out for Brazilians, people joked, was Gale\u00e3o, the international airport.Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim, the composer of \u201cThe Girl From Ipanema\u201d (and whose name is now affixed to that airport), famously observed that \u201cBrazil is not for beginners.\u201dIt was not then and it\u2019s not now. It\u2019s a vast diverse country, a tropical United States, whose rich and poor are divided by a chasm. High crime rates are in part a reflection of this divide. Flexibility is at a premium in a culture fashioned by heat, sensuality, samba and rule bending. Life can be cheap. You adapt or you perish.Edmar Bacha, a friend and economist, had coined the term \u201cBelindia\u201d to describe Brazil \u2014 a prosperous Belgium perched atop a teeming India. I wrote a story about the poor kids from north Rio, far from the beaches of Ipanema and Leblon, who would get their kicks as \u201ctrain surfers,\u201d riding the tops of fast-moving trains, rather than surf Atlantic waves. Often they died, electrocuted. I will never forget the twisted corpse of one in the city morgue.Inequity was part of the story, yet even in those tumultuous times it was not all of it. \u201cTudo bem?\u201d \u2014 \u201cAll good?\u201d \u2014 I would ask when I ventured into the ubiquitous favelas, or slums. \u201cTudo bem!\u201d was often the response, along with a smile, even when all was entirely awful. Penury in the sun is not penury in the cold.I once asked the S\u00e3o Paulo industrialist Jos\u00e9 Mindlin if he was worried about where Brazil was headed. \u201cI always worry about the end of the month,\u201d Mindlin said. \u201cBut I never worry about the future.\u201d He was right. Brazil is the graveyard of naysayers.According to the World Bank, life expectancy increased to 74.4 years in 2014 from 63.9 in 1986 (in the same period American life expectancy went up by just four years). Illiteracy is still too high but has fallen sharply.Brazil today is less Belindia than Franconesia \u2014 a substantial France atop an Indonesia. Its problems persist, but only a fool would deny that Brazil will be a major 21st-century player. As anyone attending the Olympics must feel, Brazil has a powerful and joyous national culture. It is the land of \u201cTudo bem.\u201dAll of which is to say that I am tired, very tired, of reading negative stories about these Brazilian Olympics \u2014 the anger in the slums, the violence that continues (including the armed robbery of four American swimmers), the enduring gulf between rich and poor, the occasional organizational hassles, the Russian doping and the Brazilian mosquito, money that could supposedly have been spent better than extending the Metro that now runs from the center to prosperous Barra da Tijuca (so, among other things, enabling the poor to get jobs out there).First, Brazil was never going to get the job done in time for the Olympics; now that it\u2019s shown so much success and held a magnificent opening ceremony, it\u2019s blamed for not having resolved every one of its social problems in time for the Games.There is something in the developed world that does not like a developing country that organizes a major sporting event. I heard the same jeremiads in South Africa at the time of the World Cup in 2010: the crime that would ruin things, the poverty that was shameful and the inefficiency that would plague visitors. The tournament was a triumph. I don\u2019t recall reporters combing the poorest, most crime-ridden parts of Britain in 2012 to find people ready to grumble about the London Olympics.These Olympics are good for Brazil and good for humanity, a needed tonic. Watch Usain Bolt or Simone Biles and feel uplifted.Out in the favelas some kids are dreaming in a different way right now. That, too, is a story.David Brooks is off today.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How the AK-47 and AR-15 Evolved Into Rifles of Choice for Mass Shootings", "Date": null, "News": "Time and again it\u2019s the same. A lone gunman or a small group of killers with rifles commits spectacular crimes that seize the attention of the world.The list reaches back decades: the killing of Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972; the school takeover in Beslan, Russia, in 2004; the attacks in Mumbai, India, in 2008; the mall assault in Nairobi, Kenya, in 2013; the killing of more than 100 people in Paris in 2015; the firing into a country music concert in Las Vegas in October 2017, which killed at least 58 people and wounded hundreds more in the most lethal mass shooting in modern American history; the premeditated Valentine\u2019s Day attack by a former student on a high school in Parkland, Fla.Often the rifles are variants of the AK-47, the world\u2019s most abundant firearm, an affordable and simple-to-use assault rifle of Soviet lineage that allows a few people to kill scores and menace hundreds, and fight head-to-head against modern soldiers and police forces.In recent years they have also been descendants of the AR-15, the American military\u2019s response to the Kalashnikov\u2019s spread. Semiautomatic versions of the AR-15 were used by sympathizers of the Islamic State in San Bernardino, Calif., in 2015, and by gunmen in school attacks; a Mini-14 and an MCX, rifles that fire the same cartridge as the AR-15 and compete with it for market share, were used in the mass shootings in Norway in 2011 and in Orlando, Fla., in June.The authorities said the gunman in Las Vegas used semiautomatic AR-15s, including at least one modified with a so-called \u201cbump stock\u201d to rapidly increase its rate of fire and kill 59 people and wound hundreds more. The FBI said the man who killed 11 worshippers in a synagogue in Pittsburgh fired on them with an AR-15. In the hands of terrorists, military-style rifles have repeatedly been used for swiftly killing on a large scale. How did the Kalashnikov \u2014 a disruptive technology that flooded the world almost three generations ago and still retains an outsize role in organized violence \u2014 become such a ready amplifier of evil and rage? In what ways did it drive the AR-15 and its competitors to such prominence, too?The AK-47, with an effective range beyond the length of a pair of football fields, was accepted in 1947. A few years later, a lighter and easier-to-manufacture update, the AKM, entered mass production in Russia, and was on its way to becoming the standard rifle for almost all Communist ground forces. The weapon soon left its mark.The Kalashnikov line was shorter and lighter than traditional rifles. It was inexpensive to manufacture, built for durability and reliable to an extraordinary degree. With few moving parts, and a design that made its disassembly and reassembly almost intuitive, its basics could be mastered by all manner of combatants \u2014 from traditionally instructed conscripts to almost wholly untrained guerrillas \u2014 in very little time.The cartridges were smaller than traditional rifle cartridges, which meant that a fighter with a Kalashnikov could carry more ammunition, and be more deadly, than riflemen of previous eras. The rifle\u2019s medium-power cartridges also meant the weapon had little recoil, allowing trainees to learn marksmanship at standard combat ranges with relative ease. These qualities contributed to the weapon\u2019s popularity among those who carried it; in much of the world the Kalashnikov became the everyman\u2019s gun.The Global Spread of KalashnikovsThe Kalashnikov\u2019s physical characteristics alone do not explain its prominence. It was the vast scale of rifle and ammunition manufacture in mammoth arms plants that drove the Kalashnikov to its status as one of the most immediately recognized products of the Communist era, one of the most readily identifiable objects in the world.The maps show the many ways in which it spread. Production began in the Soviet Union in the 1940s before expanding to the vassal states of the Warsaw Pact and to China, North Korea, Yugoslavia and beyond. Tens of millions of the rifles were churned out in planned economies, whether they were needed or not. In the U.S.S.R., where Kalashnikovs were cast as tools of the Motherland\u2019s defense, they entered the civic fabric. Students trained with them in schools.Ammunition plants were built in countries where the rifles were manufactured, ensuring ready supplies. More state forces adopted the weapons and began cartridge production, too. The rifle swept across much of the world. In the 1970s the Soviet Army introduced a new model, the AK-74, which fired a smaller, faster cartridge. Millions of older Kalashnikovs became officially obsolete, freeing them for global trade. Taken together, a series of industrial decisions in planned economies had created conditions for near ubiquity.Countries Wherethe Rifles HaveBeen MadeCountries WhereAmmunitionfor the RiflesHas Been MadeCountries WhoseMilitaries HaveUsed the Rifles asa Main WeaponCountries Where the Rifles Have Been MadeCountries Where Ammunition for the RiflesHas Been MadeCountries Whose Militaries Have Used theRifles as a Main WeaponSources: Armament Research Services, Conflict Armament Research, Igarap\u00e9 Institute, Peace Research Institute Oslo, Small Arms Survey.The rifles and ammunition were also manufactured in the former countries of Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Yugoslavia, which are not shown here.The spread changed modern warfare. As Communist governments passed Kalashnikovs to allies and proxies the rifles assumed an unexpected role: battlefield leveler.Vietnam offered the breakout. Africa had been colonized by small detachments of European soldiers turning machine guns against larger local forces that lacked access to equivalent weapons. In Vietnam, much of that advantage was gone. Guerrillas armed with Kalashnikovs fought toe-to-toe against foot soldiers of a superpower. Modern expeditionary units, facing automatic fire from inexpensive rifles carried by peasants, had met their close-quarters match. Often their ambitions were checked.The Kalashnikov\u2019s superiority to the American M-14 in jungle warfare in Vietnam spurred Robert S. McNamara, the defense secretary at the time, to push the Pentagon to hurry production of a new American assault rifle, the AR-15, which became known as the M-16. The decision would propel assault rifles to their current position as standard military firearms across the world.After its effectiveness was proved in Vietnam, the Kalashnikov assumed its indelible association as the terrorists\u2019 choice.Hostage-takers with Kalashnikovs scaled an Olympic Village fence in Munich in 1972 and seized members of the Israeli team. The rifle had broken its leash. It was no longer a tool of the state, or Communist ideology. The era of Kalashnikov terrorism had begun, with the world watching live on TV.Originally intended to strengthen authoritarian states, the Kalashnikov had gained outlaw credibility, morphing to a symbol of revolt, blowback, crime and jihad.The Kalashnikov\u2019s simplicity, compact size and gentle recoil combine to make it uncannily well-suited for child soldiers.In many wars commanders have provided the rifles to teenagers, and occasionally to combatants yet to reach their teenage years, who in spite of their small stature are able to manage the weapon and carry a large load of ammunition.Kalashnikovs are primary firearms for entire formations of child soldiers, including Joseph Kony\u2019s notorious Lord\u2019s Resistance Army in Africa, and the weapon is routinely used by children who augment rebel or irregular forces in wars around the world.The Islamic State, following the pattern, has made images of its child soldiers posing with Kalashnikovs part of its propaganda routine. They are not alone. Images of child soldiers with Kalashnikovs have been common in many conflicts for decades.Prone to jamming, the M-16 had a rushed and disastrous introduction in the Vietnam War. But most of its early flaws were worked out, and it secured its place in American armories. From there, NATO defense standardization prompted European services to field their own assault rifles, spreading this class of weapons across the non-Communist world.The Kalashnikov had fueled an unheralded arms race. By the 1980s the two lines of weapons \u2014 the AK-47 and the AR-15, and their many descendants and spinoffs \u2014 were a global pair.Laws in the United States mostly limited civilian possession of AR-15s and their competitors to models that fire semiautomatically only. But as these variants gained popularity with veterans, gun-rights advocates, preppers and, occasionally, with criminals or terrorists, their place in crime grew \u2014 even as Kalashnikov production ebbed. Variants of the AR-15 were used in the mass killings in a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., and at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, and by sympathizers of the Islamic State in San Bernardino. An MCX, a recently introduced military-style rifle designed for the Special Forces but available in semiautomatic form for civilians, was used by the lone gunman who attacked a nightclub in Orlando in June.The shooter in Las Vegas possessed civilian AR-15 models that had been retrofitted with inexpensive accessories, called bump stocks, that harness recoil to accelerate a semiautomatic rifle\u2019s rate of fire to rival those of automatic weapons. Semiautomatic Kalashnikovs are also part of the mass-shooting routine. The gunman in the 1989 schoolyard shooting in Stockton, Calif., which killed five children and wounded dozens more, attacked his victims with a semiautomatic Chinese Kalashnikov. His crime was part of the impetus for bans on assault-style weapons at the state and national level. The Army veteran who killed five police officers in Dallas in 2016 used a semiautomatic Kalashnikov. It had been made at the original AK-47 plant in Russia to be legal in the West and appeal to hunting and sporting markets.In the 1980s and 1990s, as Communism failed, the market economy welcomed Stalin\u2019s old goods. Successor governments continue to unload huge stockpiles, further flooding the world.Among the principal movers of Kalashnikovs has been the Pentagon, which bought them by untold thousands for proxy forces in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Pentagon also distributed tens of thousands of M-16s and the shorter M-4 carbine based on the AR-15 design, to the same forces. Many of these forces failed, yielding their rifles to bazaars or foes, making ever more weapons available on unregulated markets and for dangerous hands.Today the Kalashnikov and AR-15 variants remain the most commonly seen weapons on modern battlefields; their use is central to almost every war. They are a staple of insurgency and terrorism and all but fundamental to the grim routine of mass shootings. The Islamic State has killed far more people in Europe with bullets than with bombs, and controls territory in multiple countries in part through its military rifle stocks.Governments have done little to stop the spread of this class of weapons. Often, as in the case of the United States, they have contributed to it. Acts of crime, terror and oppression with Kalashnikovs and AR-15 descendants, endured by civilians under withering fire, have been hard-wired into our times.

{"Headline": "We\u2019re in a Low-Growth World. How Did We Get Here?", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic TrendsOne central fact about the global economy lurks just beneath the year\u2019s remarkable headlines: Economic growth in advanced nations has been weaker for longer than it has been in the lifetime of most people on earth.This trend helps explain why incomes have risen so slowly since the turn of the century, especially for those who are not top earners. It is behind the cheap gasoline you put in the car and the ultralow interest rates you earn on your savings. It is crucial to understanding the rise of Donald J. Trump, Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, and the rise of populist movements across Europe.This slow growth is not some new phenomenon, but rather the way it has been for 15 years and counting. In the United States, per-person gross domestic product rose by an average of 2.2 percent a year from 1947 through 2000 \u2014 but starting in 2001 has averaged only 0.9 percent. The economies of Western Europe and Japan have done worse than that.Over long periods, that shift implies a radically slower improvement in living standards. In the year 2000, per-person G.D.P. \u2014 which generally tracks with the average American\u2019s income \u2014 was about $45,000. But if growth in the second half of the 20th century had been as weak as it has been since then, that number would have been only about $20,000.Like most things in economics, the slowdown boils down to supply and demand: the ability of the global economy to produce goods and services, and the desire of consumers and businesses to buy them. What\u2019s worrisome is that weakness in global supply and demand seems to be pushing each other in a vicious circle.It increasingly looks as if something fundamental is broken in the global growth machine \u2014 and that the usual menu of policies, like interest rate cuts and modest fiscal stimulus, aren\u2019t up to the task of fixing it (though some well-devised policies could help).The underlying reality of low growth will haunt whoever wins the White House in November, as well as leaders in Europe and Japan. An entire way of thinking about the future \u2014 that children will inevitably live in a much richer country than their parents \u2014 is thrown into question the longer this lasts.The first step to trying to reverse the slowdown is to understand why it\u2019s happening. A good way to do that is to re-examine predictions from smart economists.As a matter of arithmetic, the slowdown in growth has two potential components: people working fewer hours, and less economic output being generated for each hour of labor. Both have contributed to the economy\u2019s underperformance.It was a distinctly minority view in that apex of technological optimism. \u201cPeople said: \u2018Productivity growth is exploding, Gordon. You\u2019re wrong; we\u2019re in a new age,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Gordon said. But as productivity growth slowed several years later, \u201cpeople started to take my point of view more and more seriously.\u201dHe offers the example of the self-check-in computer technology that airlines use. When introduced in the early 2000s, it really did mean greater productivity: Fewer airline clerks were needed for every passenger. But the gain was more a one-time bump than a continuing trend.The forecasters thought the average output for an hour of labor would rise 29 percent from 2005 to 2014. Instead it was 15 percent.But it\u2019s not just that each hour of work is producing less than projected. Fewer people are working fewer hours than seemed likely not long ago.The unemployment rate is actually lower than the C.B.O. projected it to be a decade ago (it saw it as stable at 5.2 percent; it was 4.9 percent in July). But the unemployment rate counts only those actively seeking a job. There were five million fewer Americans in the labor force \u2014 neither working nor looking \u2014 in 2015 than projected.Weak productivity and fewer workers are hits to the \u201csupply\u201d side of the economy. But there is evidence that a shortage of demand is a major part of the problem, too.Think of the economy as a car; if you try to accelerate far beyond the speed it\u2019s capable of, a car won\u2019t go any faster but the engine will overheat. Similarly, if the voluntary exit of people from the labor force and lower-than-expected gains from technological advances were the entire story behind the growth slowdown, there should be evidence the economy is overheating, resulting in inflation.That\u2019s not what\u2019s happening. Rather, global central banks are keeping their feet on the economic accelerator, and that is not resulting in any overheating at all.The distinction is important if there is to be any hope of solving the low-growth problem. If the issue is a shortage of demand, then some more stimulus should help. If it is entirely on the supply side, then government stimulus is not much use, and policy makers should focus on trying to make companies more innovative and coax people back into the work force.But what if it\u2019s both?Larry Summers, the Harvard economist and a former top official in the Obama and Clinton administrations, watched as growth stayed low and inflation invisible after the 2008 crisis, despite extraordinary stimulus from central banks. Even before the crisis, economic growth had been relatively tepid despite a housing bubble, war spending and low interest rates.While the theory is anything but settled, the case has become stronger in the last three years.But it may not be as simple as supply versus demand. Perhaps people have dropped out of the labor force because their skills and connections have atrophied. Perhaps the productivity slump is caused in part by businesses not making capital investments because they don\u2019t think there will be demand for their products.In this case, rather, as he has often put it: \u201cLack of demand creates lack of supply.\u201dHis proposed solution is that the government sharply expand investment in infrastructure, which might provide a jolt of higher demand, which in turn could help the picture on supply \u2014 helping workers who build roads and bridges become reattached to the work force, for example. As it happens, increasing infrastructure spending is among the few economic policies advocated by both Hillary Clinton and Mr. Trump.Economic history is full of unpredictable fits and starts. When Bill Clinton was elected in 1992, the internet, a defining feature of his presidency, was rarely mentioned, and Japan seemed to be emerging as the pre-eminent economic rival of the United States.In other words, there\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know about the economic future. What we do know is that if something doesn\u2019t change from the recent trend, the 21st century will be a gloomy one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "British Decision on Nuclear Plant Angers China and France", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The decision of the new British government to postpone a deal on a nuclear power station, to be built by France with major Chinese investment, has shocked both of those countries and is a potentially major step away from the policies of former Prime Minister David Cameron.The sudden choice of Prime Minister Theresa May not to sign the deal but to take until the autumn for further study, reportedly on security and economic grounds, has angered both Paris, which will be crucial to Britain\u2019s future relations with the European Union after the country\u2019s vote to leave the bloc, and Beijing, which Mr. Cameron had cultivated aggressively for investment and trade ties despite criticism that he was subordinating human rights and geopolitical concerns to commerce.The menu had already been published for a grand lunch after a signing ceremony last Friday on the Somerset coast, the site of the proposed Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, which is designed to produce 3,200 megawatts with two new French reactors at a cost of at least 18 billion pounds, about $23.7 billion.Travel by French and Chinese officials to Somerset for the party was canceled, and the \u201choi sin local lamb skewers\u201d and mackerel ceviche had to be abandoned.While Downing Street said that Mrs. May had told President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France the week before that she would postpone the deal, the board of EDF was taken by surprise. Jean-Bernard L\u00e9vy, the company\u2019s chief executive, said he had been unaware of the British hesitation before the board\u2019s vote and found out about it during a newspaper interview.Having served as home secretary for six years before becoming prime minister, Mrs. May is security minded and had expressed concerns in cabinet meetings during the Cameron administration about bringing Beijing into such a sensitive project. The project is meant to provide about 7 percent of Britain\u2019s electricity needs.She was also reported to have been unhappy on security grounds when British Telecom agreed to a deal with the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei.While China is funding just over a third of the Hinkley Point project, the real advantage for Beijing is that the deal offers China a chance to build and operate a nuclear power plant of its own design at another site in Britain, at Bradwell-on-Sea, in Essex. That reportedly troubles Mrs. May because it could give China control over an important part of Britain\u2019s energy supply.On Monday, China reacted angrily to suggestions that its investment in the project threatened British security. The official Xinhua news agency published a commentary arguing that the delay \u201cadds uncertainties to the \u2018Golden Era\u2019 of China-U.K. ties\u201d and suggesting that further Chinese investment in Britain could be rethought.\u201cChina can wait for a rational British government to make responsible decisions, but cannot tolerate any unwanted accusation against its sincere and benign willingness for win-win cooperation,\u201d the commentary said.The Hinkley Point C project is still expected to go ahead at this point, especially given the added British jobs. But Mrs. May could try to alter China\u2019s role. The delay was interpreted as a message to Beijing and Washington that her position toward China is more skeptical than that of Mr. Cameron and Mr. Osborne, who had aspirations of becoming prime minister but whom she fired from government.On Monday, Helen Bower, a spokeswoman for Mrs. May, said that Britain did not want a break with Beijing. \u201cWith the role China has to play on world affairs, on the global economy, on a whole range of international issues, we are going to continue to seek a strong relationship with China,\u201d she said.As for France, Mr. Hollande has near record disapproval ratings in the polls and faces elections in May. He has pushed for EDF to win the project as a needed lift for the country\u2019s nuclear industry, which has suffered since the disaster at Fukushima in Japan.This new-generation pressurized water reactor is complex, and the company has experienced construction problems and severe cost overruns as it tries to finish the first ones in Finland and Flamanville, France.EDF unions, some board members, engineers and senior executives have expressed deep reservations over the financial risks the construction of the reactor entailed for the indebted power company.Advertisement"}

Both crises have elicited long debates about what went wrong, whose fault it was and how to respond. Austerity? A bailout?

It is America, beneath a surreal veneer.You don\u2019t see the devastation on view in Detroit in the depths of that city\u2019s historic bankruptcy \u2014 but Puerto Rico\u2019s debt is, in fact, much bigger than Detroit\u2019s. Frightened people are leaving for the mainland, but there are still those who hope that federal oversight will bring change, and give them a reason to stay. Already, some are even coming back.The new debt relief law is stirring colonial resentment, as Puerto Rican officials denounced the \u201cjunta\u201d \u2014 or federal control board \u2014 that will soon direct this island\u2019s failing governance and finances.\u201cThis is an amazing place,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Rojas, 23, who was 6 when his parents left small-town Puerto Rico to seek work in Ohio. Now he\u2019s back, sitting on his family\u2019s porch at the top of a hill overlooking one of the island\u2019s coastal cities, catching the breeze and communing with friends on social media. Sure, the house is cramped and sometimes the power and water cut out. But things are better here, he said. His family can grow its own food year-round, and keep hens for fresh eggs. On a clear day, he can see the ocean.\u201cI\u2019m stuck here now, but that\u2019s just because I don\u2019t have a car,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of the kids here were raised before there was even a road. The houses were all built of wood then. Now they\u2019re made of cement.\u201d A concrete house can ride out a hurricane.Others are less upbeat. No one knows yet how intrusive federal oversight will be. Some expect a destructive clash of cultures. A majority of the seven-member board will be Republican; Puerto Rico\u2019s current government is aligned with the Democrats. Will things get worse before they get better? How much worse? Will they ever get better?Every day, he said, he gets calls and texts from people asking him what\u2019s going to happen and how to prepare. He doesn\u2019t know. The situation has no precedent.For months, he said, he has had the phrase \u201cDancing to the Precipice\u201d in the back of his mind. It\u2019s the title of a book about life at Versailles before the French Revolution. But to him, it captures the feelings of foreboding and powerlessness that seemingly everybody in Puerto Rico is dealing with now.\u201cWe\u2019re dancing toward a precipice because we don\u2019t know what else to do,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of this in Puerto Rico.\u201dHere are some of the dancers.\u201cPuerto Rico is Macondo. I shouldn\u2019t say it, but it\u2019s true.\u201dNight is falling over the Nemesio Canales housing project. In the yard, between the yellow low-rises, a Pentecostal group is setting up a tent, folding chairs and conga drums.\u201cSurely, the presence of the Lord is in this place,\u201d they sing. \u201cSiento su gran poder y su gracia \u2014 I can feel his mighty power and his grace.\u201dThe music floats out over the flapping laundry, the barred windows, the strutting roosters and the scrawny cats. Someone rattles a tambourine.\u201cI\u2019m dying to leave this place,\u201d says Dalia Ramos, 32, perched on the arm of her sofa with her brood: Esmeralda, 12; Aramis, 10; and Jandiel, 7. The sofa is the only real chair in the room.Home is a third-story walk-up directly under the roof, and it\u2019s hot. Some of her neighbors have air-conditioners, but Ms. Ramos can\u2019t afford one. She teaches Spanish at a private high school, earning a salary so low she qualifies for both subsidized housing and food stamps.With just a couple of fans to stir the hot air, the family keeps the windows open. There\u2019s no escaping the tent show.\u201cI can hear the rush of angels\u2019 wings.\u2026\u201dWelcome to public housing in Puerto Rico, a realm of high intentions and low outcomes. The island has America\u2019s second-largest public housing system, after New York\u2019s. Roughly 125,000 people inhabit 54,000 apartments, paying rent according to a federal formula: Rent, plus utilities, must be no more than 30 percent of a household\u2019s adjusted income.Paychecks here are small, and the tenants\u2019 rents are never enough to cover the system\u2019s costs. So Washington subsidizes the rest, currently to the tune of $254 million a year.It isn\u2019t the housing that\u2019s making Ms. Ramos want to leave. It\u2019s the crime and a culture of cheating.\u201cNegative rent!\u201d she exclaims. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t exist in other parts of the world, but in Puerto Rico, s\u00ed!\u201dPublic housing experts say \u201cnegative rent\u201d is theoretically possible; Ms. Ramos says she sees it all around her. She pays to live in the projects, but other people have found ways to be paid.The projects were built to house the working poor, like her, but over time they have cultivated a beat-the-system culture, in which working off the books and lying about your income means getting more money from Washington.\u201cI have all these people around me who don\u2019t pay anything,\u201d she says. \u201cThey just hang out.\u201dThe school where Ms. Ramos teaches is registered with the Puerto Rican tax authorities. That means the Public Housing Administration sees every aspect of her finances: earnings, withholdings, loans. It plugs the facts into the federal formula and says she should pay $320 a month.Utilities are separate, billed by another arm of the government, the Electric Power Authority.But not all employers are registered. As much as a third of all economic activity in Puerto Rico is off the books \u2014 from the homemaker running a hair salon in her kitchen to the drug dealer working out of a tackle box. People see the system as stacked against them, especially now, when the government keeps raising taxes to pay an incomprehensible debt.So people lie about their incomes, seeing it as the only way to protect themselves.Federal Housing and Urban Development records say that 36 percent of the families in Puerto Rico\u2019s housing projects have incomes of zero. By law, tenants with no income must pay $25 a month. This turns into \u201cnegative rent\u201d when their electric bills are factored in.That\u2019s because Washington gives public housing tenants a \u201cutility allowance,\u201d which is normally deducted from their rent. But if someone is paying just $25 a month, for example, and gets a utility allowance of $65 a month, they\u2019ll end up with a \u201cnegative rent\u201d of $40. It\u2019s paid in cash.Some people pocket the money and stiff the Electric Power Authority, a government monopoly with a bad track record for bill collections. The Power Authority is responsible for $9 billion of the government\u2019s $72 billion debt. It could use the money.Ms. Ramos suspects that if rates go up, Washington will send bigger utility allowances \u2014 and people living on \u201cnegative rent\u201d will get more money. She falls back on Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez to explain it. \u201cPuerto Rico is Macondo,\u201d she says, referring to the town in \u201cOne Hundred Years of Solitude,\u201d where inexplicable events are part of the routine. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t say it, but it\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cThey charged $100,000 per home, and it should have been $30,000, tops.\u201dIn 2001, Puerto Rico opened a new front in the war on poverty. It identified 742 \u201cSpecial Communities\u201d \u2014 places left behind when the rest of the economy grew. It sent organizers to find local leaders who could name the most pressing needs. And it set aside $1 billion for projects in a dedicated trust fund at the powerful Government Development Bank.The money would come from the central government, but the ideas would come from the grass roots \u2014 the people who knew best what they needed.\u201cIt was a great idea,\u201d said Carmelo Garc\u00eda, a cabinetmaker in Abra San Francisco, a cluster of houses set on steep hills outside the coastal city of Arecibo. The village was designated a Special Community. Mr. Garc\u00eda became the president of its board.First, the board surveyed residents. More than anything else, people said they wanted run-down housing fixed. The Government Development Bank released money to rebuild 11 houses. Work began.Mr. Garc\u00eda said he began to have qualms when he saw one contractor charge $15,000 for putting a simple tin roof on a house. He knew it was way too much. And it kept happening.\u201cThey charged $100,000 per home, and it should have been $30,000, tops,\u201d he said.Meanwhile, as one branch of the government spent millions trying to revive his hamlet, another one spent millions all but cutting it off from the rest of the island. The Highways and Transportation Authority, with its eyes on the island\u2019s whole economy, expanded an expressway nearby, which the planners hoped would make it easier for outlying manufacturers to get their goods to San Juan for export.The completed expressway had no exit near Abra San Francisco, and it blocked the area from all public transportation and nearly all business activity. People with jobs had no way to get to work. Families started moving away.The gleaming new expressway didn\u2019t work its magic, either. In the face of tax increases and a deep recession, manufacturers closed.Today, Abra San Francisco\u2019s biggest problem isn\u2019t dilapidated houses, Mr. Garc\u00eda said. It\u2019s empty houses. Vacancies spread blight. Squatters pull the windows right out of their frames, climb in and do drugs.\u201cWould you like to see our \u2018farm school?\u2019\u201d asked another board member, Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez.They led the way down a path. Mr. Garc\u00eda said he spent six years wangling $50,000 to expand the schoolhouse. But by the time the money came through, a stream of families had left town. So the Department of Education closed the schoolhouse.Today, the building is a makeshift horse stable for a nearby racetrack.The board thought that the schoolhouse could at least be turned into a study hall or a tutoring center. \u201cThere are tons of kids here,\u201d Mr. Garc\u00eda said.So they asked for money to get rid of the horses. But the officials said there was no money left.Meanwhile, the Highways Authority \u2014 flirting with default on its debt \u2014 privatized the expressway. Then it defaulted anyway. Now it wants to take over Abra San Francisco\u2019s school and turn it into an administrative building. But the Department of Education still holds the title and isn\u2019t giving up yet.While they squabble, the horses graze.\u201cThe way I see it is that the government steals from the government, and the people also steal from the government.\u201dThe federal oversight board that will soon take charge of Puerto Rico\u2019s finances has been given investigative powers, in the hopes it can find out where the money went.Some people here think they already know.\u201cThe way I see it is that the government steals from the government, and the people also steal from the government,\u201d said Mr. Rojas, whose family recently returned to its hometown, Cerro de Ladra, after a long stint in Ohio. \u201cIt\u2019s like a stalemate.\u201dThe family homestead is on the crest of the highest hill in all Cerro de Ladra. Times were tough in Ohio. Times are also tough in Arecibo, the city spreading on the coastal plain below.But out here on their hilltop, the family feels above the fray. They can produce homegrown food all year, Mr. Rojas said. Everyone\u2019s health has improved. His father has gone into business for himself, breeding roosters for cockfights, which are legal in Puerto Rico.They have heard that taxes may have to go up, but they aren\u2019t terribly worried. Puerto Rico may have the highest sales tax in the United States, but who cares when there\u2019s nothing to buy? Their house is exempt from property taxes because it has a tin roof. Only houses with concrete roofs are assessed.Just about the only complaint is the closed schoolhouse \u2014 the horse stables \u2014 in nearby Abra San Francisco. Come fall, Mr. Rojas\u2019s young cousins will have to take the bus to another town.And then, there\u2019s the matter of the giant statue.Years ago, Zurab Tsereteli, the Russian artist known for his giant outdoor sculptures, created a bronze-and-steel figure of Christopher Columbus at a ship\u2019s wheel, sails billowing above him. He presented it to the United States for the 500th anniversary of Columbus\u2019s voyage.But on the mainland, city after city turned it down. It stands taller than the Statue of Liberty and weighs 600 tons. City councils thought it would mar their skylines or perhaps be a hazard to aircraft.Finally, Puerto Rico accepted it.The statue towers alarmingly over its neighboring houses and roadside restaurants. But from the Rojas porch, it\u2019s just a harmless folly on the horizon.\u201cMy father said he heard that Puerto Rico is going to be one of the first countries to go underwater because of global warming,\u201d Mr. Rojas said. \u201cI said, \u2018Yeah, and that statue is going to add a couple more pounds to sink it faster.\u2019\u201d\u201cWhen he was arrested, I thought, \u2018When would he have had time to cause trouble?\u2019\u201dPuerto Rico\u2019s most famous slum, La Perla, stands on some of the island\u2019s most coveted real estate. It rises precariously above the Atlantic shoreline, a cluster of gaily painted houses clinging to a bluff just outside the walled city of Old San Juan.Every day, tourists file off the cruise ships that dock nearby and stroll the steep cobbled streets of Old San Juan, taking in the views and the sea breeze. From the heights, they can look down into La Perla\u2019s rabbit warren of houses, shoehorned between the 16th-century crenelated fortress El Morro and another Spanish citadel.But tourists seldom venture into La Perla. Guides warn against it, citing drug lords, thieves, gun battles, knife fights and lookouts who might mistake you for an undercover cop. If you get into trouble in La Perla, it\u2019s said, the police won\u2019t come for you.Among locals in Puerto Rico, it\u2019s customary to bond with a padrino \u2014 a godfather \u2014 who has the connections and clout to help you move ahead in life and solve problems. La Perla is a tough place, and for many years, it had a suitably tough godfather: Jorge G\u00f3mez Gonz\u00e1lez, a man known to all as Cara de Truck, or Truckface.\u201cHe did everything for people,\u201d says his wife, Irma Narv\u00e1ez, sitting in her kitchen on a quiet Sunday morning, \u201cfrom buying groceries to helping repair their roofs if they collapsed.\u201dFrom morning to late afternoon, she says, he was at City Hall, calling in favors, twisting arms, being photographed with dignitaries. From 9 p.m. to 2 a.m., he worked on the docks as a welder and crane operator.\u201cWhen he was arrested, I thought, \u2018When would he have had time to cause trouble?\u2019\u201d she says.\u201cEvery time the phone rings, I hope they\u2019re saying, \u2018Come and get him. He\u2019s a free man,\u2019\u201d his wife says.Outsiders are always talking about \u201cimproving\u201d things in La Perla. The locals think that means pushing them out.Even Donald Trump tried it, they allege. His bodyguards wouldn\u2019t let him come into La Perla, but he stood on the heights and said he would buy them out for $11 million.No dice.That was 10 years ago. Then in 2010 came an ambitious urban renewal plan, promising to untangle bottlenecks, restore fading neighborhoods, triple the number of hotels, add light-rail service and water taxis, and even put a sand beach right in front of La Perla, where now there are only rocks.From La Perla, it looked like another land grab in the works. The federal government owns San Juan\u2019s Spanish fortifications. It forbids private buildings within 30 feet of the walls, even if the locals think they own the land.A few months later came the biggest raid in La Perla\u2019s history. The police broke down the door, Tasered Truckface and took him away. They also took the deed to the house, Ms. Narv\u00e1ez says.More than 100 people were indicted on drug and weapons charges. Ms. Narv\u00e1ez says her husband had no drugs, no weapons and no time for conspiracies. But prosecutors said he was the linchpin of the whole scheme. They made him lead defendant in a case called United States of America v. Jorge G\u00f3mez Gonz\u00e1lez, a.k.a. Jorge \u201cCara de Truck.\u201dThe indictment called for the defendants to jointly pay $20 million or forfeit that amount in property, and it listed houses all over La Perla.Ms. Narv\u00e1ez thinks it was all about getting their land.On a walking tour of La Perla, she points out a home where her uncle lived, which has been seized by the government. It\u2019s still standing, but the man next door, H\u00e9ctor Torres, says federal agents tore down his garage. It, too, was too close to the old Spanish wall.What else could he do but put up a new swimming pool, right here in no man\u2019s land, and keep on living the American dream? \u201cI\u2019m not scared of dying for this if I have to,\u201d he says, while children and grandchildren frolic in the water. \u201cI\u2019ve taught all my kids to fight for this.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve been taught to depend on the United States. They taught us in school that Puerto Rico was too small, and it had to depend on a bigger country.\u201d\u201cAll this used to be coffee,\u201d says Yanna Muriel, with a wave of her hand toward a hillside planted with citrus and guava trees in the island\u2019s lush interior mountain range. The star fruit are coming into season now, and the first few to ripen are scattered on the ground.\u201cThey\u2019re still a little green, but you can eat them,\u201d she says, picking up a few to offer. \u201cThey\u2019ll be sweet.\u201dA storm has just blown through. Every leaf is wet, and the sun shining through the lingering clouds seems to make the landscape glow.You don\u2019t need to know about farming to see why Ms. Muriel is determined to preserve the 30-acre farm her parents carved out of lovely, unforgiving terrain here. But it helps to know a bit of the island\u2019s history.Seen through local eyes, it\u2019s all about outsiders imposing their will on Puerto Rico, to its lasting detriment. Spain brought disease and African slaves and built a plantation economy. The French, the British and the Dutch all wanted what Spain had and mounted attack after futile attack on the slave-built fortifications. Then the Americans attacked, took possession and muscled their way into the sugar business, crowding many local farmers off their land.Even America\u2019s big development push in the 1950s, Operation Bootstrap, is viewed as suspect. With tax incentives for United States manufacturers, it prompted Puerto Ricans to leave the hinterland by the thousands. As they flocked to San Juan to seek factory jobs, Washington responded with new public housing, paved roads and schools.Living standards rose, but Puerto Ricans see a big downside: A whole generation learned that life in the country was backward and miserable, something to escape. Farming, once the island\u2019s mainstay, fell to less than 1 percent of its economic output. Today the island imports 82 percent of its food.\u201cAgriculture died, and with that, all of the local markets died,\u201d says Ms. Muriel, pausing to point out a tree she ate tangerines from as a girl. Today, she says, it\u2019s a thrill to see her own daughters, Emma and Ceiba, eating fruit from that same tree.But you can\u2019t bring the fruit to market if the market no longer exists.Today, Puerto Ricans shop in supermarkets. Go into one and you\u2019re apt to find oranges from California, bananas from the Dominican Republic, avocados from Mexico and no local produce. Even staples like rice, beans and coffee are imported.They certainly aren\u2019t cheap. A 1917 law requires Puerto Rico to import everything on American ships with American crews. That adds to retail prices.Ms. Muriel isn\u2019t the only one turning her back on all this. Here and there, other young Puerto Ricans are moving back to the land that their parents and grandparents abandoned, trying to revive farming and a sense of self.And there are signs they are getting a toehold. For the last two or three years, fresh local produce has been turning up on public school lunch menus. Rice is now being grown on the island for the first time in around 30 years.Back when all those thousands of Puerto Ricans were abandoning the countryside, Ms. Muriel\u2019s parents bucked the trend. Her mother, Veeta Mohan, spotted a \u201cLand for Sale\u201d sign on a bulletin board at the coin laundry. She and her husband, now deceased, decided to take the plunge.When they bought the 30 acres, it was planted entirely in coffee, and struggling. The seller made ends meet by running a bar by the side of the road. For the first few years, Ms. Mohan says, all she seemed to do was dig up the empty bottles people had thrown. But she persisted and ended up raising six children here.There were government programs to help coffee planters, but Ms. Mohan saw them as a ploy to hook Puerto Rico\u2019s farmers on herbicides from the United States. Out went the coffee bushes. In went fruit trees, bamboo, orchids and herbs, all organically grown.\u201cAround here, we\u2019re the only organic farm,\u201d Ms. Muriel says.Today, all that\u2019s left of the coffee plantation is an old system of roads, now used as footpaths. The family plants nothing in rows, preferring groves that combine plants they think will benefit one another \u2014 citrus near guavas, for example. The result is a farm that looks more like a forest.Her farm isn\u2019t profitable, but perhaps self-sufficiency is its own reward.\u201cWe\u2019ve been taught to depend on the United States,\u201d Ms. Muriel says. \u201cThey taught us in school that Puerto Rico was too small, and it had to depend on a bigger country.\u201d She shakes her head, then bends to smell the orchid that Ceiba has picked.\u201cThe valves, sutures, tissues for repairing the heart all get more expensive every day, and the hospital cannot get any more money.\u201dDr. Enrique M\u00e1rquez Grau, 81, is one of just two pediatric heart surgeons in Puerto Rico. Many people slow down in their 80s, but he says he can keep up.\u201cActually, there has been an exodus of young people,\u201d he says.Dr. M\u00e1rquez Grau exemplifies a peculiar side effect of Puerto Rico\u2019s financial crisis: the graying of its doctors. It\u2019s most extreme in the pediatric specialties. There is only one pediatric anesthesiologist on the whole island, serving a population of about 900,000 people under 18.There are just six pediatric surgeons of any kind. Dr. M\u00e1rquez Grau himself trained four of them. All are over 50.Even for adults, surgeons are in short supply. There are 180, for a population of about 3.5 million. The average age is 58.Puerto Rico\u2019s financial troubles are driven, to a remarkable degree, by health care. In 1993, Puerto Rico set up an islandwide health plan for people lacking coverage at work \u2014 but it didn\u2019t establish a way to pay for it.Today the program, known as Mi Salud, or My Health, provides generous coverage to 45 percent of the population. For now, federal money covers much of the cost, but much of that money is scheduled to run out in a year or two. Meanwhile, Mi Salud has been scrimping by delaying payments to doctors. It is about $200 million behind.\u201cThis hospital has a big deficit, which increases every year,\u201d says Dr. M\u00e1rquez Grau, taking time between patients to answer questions. \u201cThe valves, sutures, tissues for repairing the heart all get more expensive every day, and the hospital cannot get any more money.\u201dDr. M\u00e1rquez Grau has no intention of leaving. He has been working at Puerto Rico\u2019s sophisticated Centro M\u00e9dico since it was built, in better times.\u201cIt\u2019s a very good hospital,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity that it doesn\u2019t have money.\u201d\u201cThere are 28,000 people on the street on this island.\u201dDoctors aren\u2019t the only ones hurting as the government tries to stretch health care dollars. Patients say it can now take weeks or months to be seen by a specialist. Hospitals have fewer beds, and insurers drag their feet when asked to approve even lifesaving treatments, like chemotherapy.But for all that, the safety net still holds. People can get care if they\u2019re in the system and can bear to wait. Not so the indigent \u2014 the people who have fallen through the holes in the net.Iniciativa Comunitaria has mapped Puerto Rico\u2019s comunas, or informal homeless camps, and set up delivery routes to them. On a recent night, volunteers packed a guitar with their other supplies, just in case the mood seemed right for music. Some of the homeless said they wanted to sleep, but others sang.In the parking lot of a gun club in the San Juan metropolitan area, the volunteers came upon a man they knew only as Don Luis. He had a walking stick, a crucifix and big open sores on his legs. Heroin users who sleep in the rough are prone to soft-tissue infections where they shoot up.\u201cWe don\u2019t force anyone to go into any treatment,\u201d said Kamille Camacho, a public health student with the group. But if people say they want to go into rehab, or to enroll in Mi Salud, then Iniciativa Comunitaria helps with the paperwork.But not Don Luis. Once he went to a hospital, but the staff made it clear, he says, that he and his ilk were unwelcome. They yanked off his dirty bandages, slapped on some new ones and gave him the bum\u2019s rush. The treatment made his sores worse, he says. He won\u2019t go back.Now the volunteers lead him into the pool of light from a streetlight and seat him on the gun club\u2019s front steps. They wet his dirty gauze with a spray bottle and pull it off gently, layer by layer. Don Luis groans in pain.\u201cThere\u2019s no rush,\u201d one says reassuringly. Another massages his shoulders.Don Luis says he doesn\u2019t want ointment. He\u2019s afraid it will make the gauze stick. The volunteers wash his calves and wrap them in layers of fresh gauze, tape them, then give him a new pair of socks. Then, after a cheese sandwich, a cup of coffee and a few jokes, Don Luis disappears into the night.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Other Campaign Foe: The \u2018Lowest Form of Life\u2019 News Media", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDonald J. Trump was on the defensive all week, battered from all sides for his heated statements hailing the Second Amendment and linking political opponents to the Islamic State.But on Friday morning, Mr. Trump rose early to strike back at his favorite adversary.\u201cRatings challenged @CNN reports so seriously that I call President Obama (and Clinton) \u2018the founder\u2019 of ISIS,\u201d Mr. Trump fumed on Twitter shortly after dawn. \u201cTHEY DON\u2019T GET SARCASM?\u201dHe soon fired off another gibe. \u201cI love watching these poor, pathetic people (pundits) on television working so hard and so seriously to try and figure me out,\u201d Mr. Trump taunted. \u201cThey can\u2019t!\u201dThe social-media broadside was no aberration. Long a vehement critic of the political news media, Mr. Trump has increasingly organized his general-election effort around antagonizing the press. He dedicates long sections of his speeches and innumerable tweets to savaging individual outlets, and claiming that media bias could effectively \u201crig\u201d the election for Hillary Clinton.At times, his enthusiasm for venting anger about the news media has seemed to rival his interest in criticizing Mrs. Clinton. In Erie, Pa., on Friday, Mr. Trump swerved back and forth between attacks on Mrs. Clinton and an extended airing of grievances about the press.The news media, he said, was determined to cover up Mrs. Clinton\u2019s missteps and highlight his own. (Mr. Trump allowed that Fox News, home to several anchors who openly favor his candidacy, was an exception.)\u201cThese people are the lowest form of life, I\u2019m telling you,\u201d he said, pointing at the journalists covering his rally. \u201cThey are the lowest form of humanity.\u201dIn Altoona, Pa., on Friday evening, Mr. Trump continued his diatribe: \u201cIt is so ridiculous, the pile on,\u201d he complained of the coverage of his campaign. \u201cEvery single day, story after story after story.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s crowd-pleasing allegations of news media malevolence also serve a tactical purpose: Providing him license to revise or play down his remarks. After stating several times this week that he considered Mr. Obama to be the founder of the Islamic State, Mr. Trump reversed course on Friday with a declaration that he had only been speaking sarcastically and that the press simply did not understand.In Pennsylvania, he reiterated that he had been sarcastic, but added: \u201cNot that sarcastic, to be honest with you.\u201dRepublicans often complain about the national news media, arguing that most reporters and publications are tilted against them. In the 1992 presidential race, Republicans even produced a bumper sticker urging voters to \u201cannoy the media\u201d by re-electing President George Bush. And in his 2016 primary campaign, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida accused the press of being the equivalent of a \u201csuper PAC\u201d for Democrats.On the Democratic side, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont fulminated this year about the \u201ccorporate media,\u201d which he described as hostile to liberal ideals. And aides and supporters of Mrs. Clinton routinely complain that reporters treat her unfairly.But the Trump campaign has made accusations of news media bias a pervasive theme, and has attacked publications and reporters with virulence. Since last year, Mr. Trump has made a practice of riling up his crowds with mockery of the media, often pointing to the press risers and describing reporters as dishonest.In Erie on Friday, his audience jeered each time Mr. Trump mentioned a news outlet, and at one point many in the crowd turned their backs on him to face the press and express their contempt with a variety of shouts and gestures. \u201cDinosaur media is failing!\u201d one man yelled.If bashing the media proved an effective way of rallying the Republican base to his side during the primaries, Mr. Trump must now prove himself to a broader community of voters in the general election, who are far less preoccupied with the notion of press bias. Republican strategists see Mr. Trump\u2019s offensive mainly as an exercise in thin-skinned defensiveness, rather than a shrewd political strategy.Kevin Madden, a former spokesman for Mitt Romney\u2019s and George W. Bush\u2019s presidential campaigns, said Mr. Trump was veering away from issues actually weighing on swing voters, which he said were \u201ceconomy and security-focused.\u201d\u201cWhining about media coverage is just that: It\u2019s whining,\u201d Mr. Madden said. Of complaints, Mr. Madden said: \u201cAny campaign that tells you it makes a difference with swing voters is just lying to themselves and lazy, because it\u2019s easier than developing an actual strategy or message.\u201dStill, Mr. Trump has intensified his comments, and his top surrogates have raced to join him: Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, engaged in a tense half-hour colloquy on CNN on Thursday, insisting that the media had wronged Mr. Trump in its treatment of his candidacy. \u201cA lot of coverage is rigged,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said.And the Trump campaign, which for months has kept a list of outlets barred from receiving press credentials to cover his events, has now taken to putting out regular emails that attack newspapers and websites for alleged bias.The emails feature lengthy denunciations of the offending outlet, accompanied by an image of the publication with a red or yellow stamp over it reading: \u201cMedia bias offender.\u201d The messages also include offensive headlines, highlighted with circles around them, mimicking Mr. Trump\u2019s habit of cutting out newspaper articles and circling in marker what he finds objectionable.Ari Fleischer, the former White House press secretary under Mr. Bush, said Mr. Trump was so far behind in the campaign that his fixation on the press was unlikely to help.Mr. Fleischer, who holds that there is an \u201coverarching ideological edge\u201d toward Democrats in the media, said Mr. Trump was using claims of news media bias to cover for his own missteps. Mr. Trump\u2019s offhand comment about \u201cSecond Amendment people,\u201d which was widely interpreted as a joke about assassinating politicians, was a case in point, Mr. Fleischer said.\u201cWhen I first heard it and then saw the print coverage of it, I thought: This is the media again, taking it too far,\u201d Mr. Fleischer said. \u201cAnd then I watched the video and I thought: What a fool. This is bona fide. He\u2019s created this problem for himself.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Dynasty,\u2019 the Nicaragua Version", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialA decade ago, President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua made a startling comeback by persuading voters to give him a second shot at running the country. It was a hard-fought victory for the former guerrilla leader, coming after three electoral defeats.This November\u2019s presidential election, however, won\u2019t be a democratic exercise. Drawing relatively little international scrutiny, Mr. Ortega has worked in recent years to consolidate power by building a vast network of patronage and vanquishing the political opposition.Mr. Ortega\u2019s dominance in Nicaragua stands in stark contrast to the fate of other leftist governments that rose to power in the last decade. The appeal of leftist leaders in Bolivia, Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina and Ecuador has ebbed as the commodities boom that enabled them to dole out generous social benefits crashed, bringing the mismanagement and corruption of their governments into sharp focus.Mr. Ortega and his wife have been at the center of Nicaragua\u2019s turbulent history for decades. They were members of the Sandinista National Liberation Front, a leftist rebel group that overthrew the Somoza family, which ran the country dictatorially from the 1930s to 1979. Mr. Ortega became president in 1984 in an election that international monitors called the nation\u2019s first credible vote. His bid for re-election in 1990 failed, in large part because of allegations of corruption.Mr. Ortega packed the courts and the National Assembly with allies, which paved the way for a 2014 legislative change that allows the president to run indefinitely for five-year terms. Ms. Murillo, meanwhile, has become a highly visible public figure with a daily radio show, and personally awards land titles and other benefits to Nicaraguans.Under Mr. Ortega, 70, the country\u2019s tiny economy has grown. And he has managed to work closely with international donors, foreign investors and the private sector, all while collecting financial aid from Venezuela. Nicaragua, which has a vast police force that keeps close tabs on its citizens, has also remained safer than three of its northern neighbors, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. Gangs and violent drug trafficking has caused tens of thousands of people from those nations to flee to the United States in recent years.The country\u2019s relative security is no reason to tolerate repression and authoritarianism. Genuine political competition and a free press are necessary cures to the corruption and inefficiency that so often corrode authoritarian systems. The course of Mr. Ortega\u2019s own political history should serve as reminder that overthrowing a government can be the citizens\u2019 response when all other avenues for dissent are shut.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Defiant Toasts at the Gawker Wake", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo it made sense that it commemorated its own bankruptcy proceedings and impending sale Wednesday night in Manhattan with a party at its Chelsea offices.At 7 p.m., a couple of hundred writer types were milling around the offices, where there was a makeshift bar, serving wine and beer, with boxes of pepperoni pies from Joe\u2019s Pizza stacked on top of it.\u201cI\u2019m looking around realizing how few people I know,\u201d said David Haskell, the deputy editor of New York magazine. \u201cIt\u2019s like, did I miss it?\u201dActually, no. That\u2019s just how it feels when you find yourself at a reunion of a media company that has become a revolving door for young writers and editors. Most of them served their apprenticeships under the Gawker founder and chief executive, Nick Denton, before moving out of his sphere.Many returned having gone on to substantial success.But gimlet-eyed humor was not the prevailing sentiment of the evening. Instead, Gawker veterans past and present largely framed the last few years as a David-versus-Goliath struggle between a scrappy group of renegades and a gaggle of 1-percenters intent on bringing them down.At 7:45, she and fellow Gawker veterans headed away from the office space and into the adjacent amphitheater.\u201cTo all the writers who were here in the early years, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were very cheap.\u201dMr. Denton, who wore a fitted white shirt from Banana Republic and gray slacks, said the last year was especially hard on staff members who worked hard to increase traffic even as the ax hung over their heads.\u201cI\u2019m incredibly proud of how they stuck together during this tricky time,\u201d he said, going on to note the punishing economics of the media business and the growing power of Facebook.\u201cWe just had a national conversation out of the D.N.C. when the father of a soldier who was killed in battle said to Donald Trump, \u2018What have you sacrificed?\u2019\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cNot that the sacrifices here come close to losing a loved one, but it is a sacrifice to be a 23-year-old kid and to find your name on a complaint from Hulk Hogan.\u201dAfter that came a toast from Gawker\u2019s president and general counsel, Heather Dietrick, along with more remarks from Mr. Denton, who then made his way back to the bar.\u201cAt this point, you\u2019ve probably heard more than I,\u201d said Tom Scocca, the features editor of Gawker Media. \u201cZiff Davis has put their name on it, that\u2019s the only thing I know.\u201dIn the early years of the site\u2019s existence, Mr. Denton was a hard man to read, seemingly emotionless, with a religious devotion to truth and a seeming indifference to humanity.\u201cThis was at the heart of my conflict with Nick,\u201d Mr. Sicha said after watching Mr. Denton speak.But at the party, it seemed to Mr. Sicha that something had shifted or that he had misjudged his former boss.\u201cI don\u2019t know if we didn\u2019t get Nick early on, or if he just opened up,\u201d Mr. Sicha said. \u201cPeople always said that he was this cold, heartless person, and it either wasn\u2019t true then or it isn\u2019t true now.\u201dNevertheless, Mr. Denton remained defiant. He stood in a sea of current and former employees, and he was talking about Gawker as if it were the only media entity on earth with guts enough to take on the powers that be.\u201cThe economy\u2019s going to be dominated by a dozen monopolies, and people who have their share of the monopoly profits are going to be able to buy the press and use the court system to their advantage,\u201d he said.Mr. Denton and others in the fold seemed somewhat less inclined to address the mix of admiration and contempt journalists hold toward Gawker, recognizing it as both a training ground for gifted young writers and a place where too many of the articles published were not only mean but inconsequential.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s many people who work at Gawker who think it is beyond reproach,\u201d Mr. Scocca said. \u201cBut when you\u2019ve been put through a show trial, there\u2019s not a lot to be gained from adding to that testimony.\u201dToward the end of the party, the scent of Parliaments and Camel Lights filled the room, and Mr. Denton walked around basking in the affection of his troupe.It was hard to see him as the gossipy Julian Assange-like character he had once been. He had tears in his eyes as he made the rounds, and he seemed, finally and completely, human.An earlier version of this article misstated the alcoholic drinks served at the party. Only beer and wine were served. There was no vodka.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Challenge of Cutting Coal Dependence", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneIt won\u2019t be easy to get rid of coal.Worried the nation might miss its 2020 target to drastically cut emissions of carbon dioxide, the German government proposed a steep levy last year on the most heavily polluting generators. The tax was intended to deliver a decisive blow against lignite or brown coal, the dirtiest fuel around and Germany\u2019s main source of electricity.Germany views itself as a leader in the push against climate change. It is probably the world\u2019s most enthusiastic investor in renewable energy, mainly wind and sun. But even the powerful Chancellor Angela Merkel couldn\u2019t quite pull it off.Berlin\u2019s hesitance may seem like little more than a snag in Germany\u2019s vaunted \u201cEnergiewende.\u201d At least the coal generators are scheduled to shut down eventually.But the resistance in the greenest of green countries underscores a more substantial challenge to the international effort to drastically reduce fossil fuels in the world\u2019s energy supply: workers and retirees, local economies and communities still depend on the fuels the rest of us hope to let go of to preserve the planet for our children and our children\u2019s children.But making those who will suffer from this transformation whole is not just a matter of fairness. A successful transition to a low-carbon future requires their support. And yet they remain pretty much an afterthought in the public debate over climate change.\u201cThe scale and the scope of the transition is enormous,\u201d said Matt Baker, a former commissioner with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission who is now a program officer for energy and climate at the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation. \u201cYou can\u2019t do it in the time frame we are thinking about without the consent of the so-called losers in the transition.\u201dThe stakes are even larger in China. It is the world\u2019s largest consumer of coal \u2014 burning as much as every other country combined. After years adding coal-fired generators at breakneck speed, the government in Beijing finally acknowledged the public health costs and ordered limits on new construction.To protect jobs and tax revenue from small coal mines, Chinese local governments have been known to fib when Beijing has demanded they stop producing coal. They stop reporting production numbers but don\u2019t shut them down.\u201cThe way many jurisdictions are going is to follow the German model,\u201d said Mark C. Thurber, associate director for research at Stanford University\u2019s Program on Energy and Sustainable Development. \u201cIt seems totally nuts, but it follows from the fact that renewables have a lot of support, and other than that, people do what they know, which is coal.\u201dIndia draws 62 percent of its power from coal and is already the second-largest consumer after China and ahead of the United States. Coal consumption is growing about 7 percent a year to power the country\u2019s economic catch-up.\u201cThere is not much research into backing out coal with something else,\u201d Mr. Thurber said. \u201cThey are just throwing renewables at a coal base.\u201d While environmentalists welcomed India\u2019s announcement last year that it would increase investment in solar energy, they were less pleased by its plans to triple coal production from 2013 to 2020.This means the world\u2019s climate change strategy cannot rely on the quick replacement of the dirtiest fuel around. Increasing investment in technologies like carbon capture and storage may prove indispensable to meet the limits on carbon dioxide emissions needed to prevent a catastrophic warming over coming decades.Even after all this is dealt with and the obstacles are overcome, the human dimension will remain.It will require a lot of attention, and more than a few billion dollars. Simply assuming that displaced coal miners will make a smooth transition into jobs in newfangled energy industries, which have a different geographical footprint and require a different skill set, is a cop-out.The world\u2019s energy transition cannot be portrayed simply as \u201cBig Coal vs. virtuous wind and solar.\u201d Horrible as this might sound to economists \u2014 who believe in taxing polluters, not rewarding them \u2014 the energy transition may require paying the dirtiest generators, as Germany has done, to stick around.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mexico\u2019s Richest Man Confronts a New Foe: The State That Helped Make Him Rich", "Date": "2016-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 All is not well in the kingdom of Carlos Slim.For more than 25 years, he has dictated the terms of Mexico\u2019s telecommunications industry and built an empire, making him one of the world\u2019s richest men.But at home in Mexico, the game is changing. And there is not much he can do about it, analysts say.Determined to bring his dominance to an end, leaders from Mexico\u2019s three biggest political parties have put aside their own animosities in recent years, meeting in secret sessions to chip away at Mr. Slim\u2019s domain.Profits for Mr. Slim\u2019s flagship company, Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil, are in steep decline, falling 24 percent in 2015 and almost 44 percent in the first six months of this year, compared with the year-earlier periods. A closely watched metric of profitability on Wall Street has also fallen, and the company\u2019s stock has dropped by 39 percent in the past year.\u201cWhat has changed the most and is most relevant here is the authorities, and their attitude toward this empire,\u201d said Ernesto Piedras, the director general of the Competitive Intelligence Unit, a consulting and research firm. \u201cThis is the first time Slim does not have a copy of all the keys.\u201dRegulators in Mexico, sometimes against their government\u2019s wishes, had tried for decades to rein in Mr. Slim\u2019s dominance, finding themselves thwarted at every turn.But when the Institutional Revolutionary Party took back the presidency in 2012, it looked to reassert its power in a country where the state \u2014 not big businesses \u2014 has traditionally been king. And Mr. Slim offered a way to score political points at the same time: Mexicans were already openly scornful of what they called his expensive and often unreliable service.For Mexico, the telecom law offers a stark contrast to the state\u2019s many failed promises \u2014 to end corruption, enact the rule of law and bridge inequality. That the government has managed to take on Mr. Slim, arguably the country\u2019s most powerful citizen, is proof that where there is political will in Mexico, there is a way.\u201cThis administration invested in the economic reforms, but they ignored the reforms in the judicial system and in the field of corruption,\u201d said Enrique Krauze, a prominent Mexican historian who knows Mr. Slim.Still, the changes have done little to dent Mr. Slim\u2019s market share. He retains nearly 70 percent of the cellphone market and about 65 percent of fixed lines.In an interview, Mr. Slim said the new law established a certainty that all businessmen appreciate. But he bristled at the notion that his company required special regulation, or that it had stalled or impeded regulation in the past.\u201cLook at all the regulation they have imposed on us. Look at them!\u201d he said. \u201cEvery time they complain about something, they lobby to impose a regulation.\u201d\u201cThey thought they would come and bulldoze us, just because they are called AT&T,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the one hand, they say \u2018the biggest network in North America,\u2019 and on the other, they say that because they are small here we should subsidize them.\u201dThis year, Mexican regulators will determine if the new measures are enough to curb Mr. Slim\u2019s dominance. Regulators can crack down further if they decide Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil is not opening up to competition \u2014 by imposing large fines or even ordering its breakup.Overall, Mr. Slim appeared sanguine about his prospects.\u201cI have said it various times: Telecommunications are the nervous system of the new civilization,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to have a medium and long-term vision. You can\u2019t have quarterly visions.\u201dNot all analysts share his view.\u201cThe worst is not yet over,\u201d said Andre Baggio, an analyst at J.P.Morgan.Even before he became a household name in Mexico, Carlos Slim was a wealthy man. During the turmoil of the 1980s, a time of severe debt crises often called Mexico\u2019s lost decade, he had grown rich by snapping up bankrupt firms.As the country slid further into economic depression, Mr. Slim was the rare businessman with deep pockets. So President Carlos Salinas, under pressure in 1990 to sell off state-owned companies, dispatched a top official to gauge Mr. Slim\u2019s interest in buying the national phone company, Tel\u00e9fonos de M\u00e9xico.The pitch was straightforward: Whoever bought the company would receive a temporary monopoly. In exchange, the winner would have to invest billions in a company so decrepit that Mexicans never knew whether they would get a dial tone.Mr. Slim seemed skeptical. Still, he smelled opportunity.\u201cIf I enter and win, it\u2019s going to change my life,\u201d Jacques Rogozinski, the Mexican official in charge of the sale, recalled Mr. Slim saying.And so it did.There are many stories of Carlos Slim\u2019s rise: the son of Lebanese immigrants who inherited a family retail business and built an empire, piece by piece, down the long Latin American stretch of the Western Hemisphere. Those vast holdings include a significant number of shares in The New York Times.But there is another side, officials say \u2014 of tying up regulation in countless legal knots, of befriending the rich and powerful who identified his success with their own.This assertion enrages Mr. Slim, who denies stymying regulation. Ultimately, it comes down to customer choice, he said, in Mexico or anywhere else.\u201cYou can\u2019t, in a market of 110 million consumers, hold on unless people prefer to stay with you,\u201d he said.Shortly after winning the bid for Telmex, as the national phone company is called, Mr. Slim got to work improving service with his original partners, Southwestern Bell and France T\u00e9l\u00e9com, both of which later sold their stakes in the partnership. They installed millions of phone lines, and curtailed the common practice of repairmen asking for bribes.For years, the government left Mr. Slim to tend to the monopoly without interference. He was building something bigger than a company. As one of the first major emerging market stocks, Telmex was seen as a bellwether for an entire asset class on Wall Street. Hurt Telmex, the logic went, and you could hurt the market\u2019s perception of Mexico.But eventually, there was dissension in the ranks. Officials entrusted with policing competition in Mexico tried to rein him in. In 1997, the Mexican Federal Competition Commission ruled that Telmex was too powerful.Shortly before the ruling, the head of the commission, Fernando S\u00e1nchez Ugarte, got a call from a nervous senior official.\u201cThis will destroy the stock market,\u201d he recalled the official telling him.Mr. Slim\u2019s appeals of the ruling lasted a decade, until a judge decided in his favor. The regulators \u2014 outnumbered, outspent and trying to enforce weak laws \u2014 never stood much of a chance, former officials said.Regulators recall how Mr. Slim\u2019s lawyers would file into a conference room, wheeling large boxes of documents for routine meetings. At least once, the phalanx of lawyers was told to wait outside because the room was too small.\u201cThe story is not about Slim,\u201d said Robert K. Lacy, who was in charge of regulatory issues for Avantel, an early competitor to Telmex. \u201cThe government just buckled.\u201dMr. Slim said he never meant to tie up the system or compete unfairly. Rather, he said, when faced with an unjust fine or restriction, he simply fought back.Mr. Slim is often likened to Warren Buffett for his relatively low-key, avuncular style. He still lives in the modest home where he raised his children and drives himself around town, unlike many in Mexico\u2019s minted class.Years ago, on a visit to one of his ubiquitous Sanborns department stores, Mr. Slim spotted one of Mexico\u2019s most renowned poets, Homero Aridjis, reading a newspaper for sale in the store.Mr. Slim insisted he buy it.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t believe anything should be for free,\u201d said Mr. Aridjis, adding that Mr. Slim eventually backed down.Rather than hosting lavish spreads for meetings, Mr. Slim sometimes just orders in from Sanborns, whose aesthetic is reminiscent of an older generation of American diners.His reach extends far beyond Mexico, gained with an ability to time investments well and then exploit every opportunity to bolster them.He swept into Brazil in 2000, buying up cellphone companies to create a national one. He then fought a nearly decade-long lawsuit by the investment arm of Brazil\u2019s state-owned development bank, and waited patiently for lawmakers to let foreigners increase their control over pay television.It was classic Slim. Today, Brazil is Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil\u2019s largest subscriber market \u2014 larger even than Mexico.His strategy included building a close relationship with the president at the time, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who now faces obstruction charges in an enormous corruption probe. Mr. Slim has not been accused of any wrongdoing.It was not the first time Mr. Slim befriended a president. In Panama, he made fast friends with Mart\u00edn Torrijos, flying down for meetings, sharing dinners and even lending him a jet to attend the funeral of Pope John Paul II.Panama represented an opening, and Mr. Slim wanted in. After years of stagnation under the dictatorship of Manuel Noriega, Panama pinned its hopes on investment. Mr. Slim, in turn, saw a chance to expand his cellphone empire and win contracts for the expansion of the Panama Canal.He managed both, but Mr. Slim wanted more: a concession to build and operate a hydroelectric power station. There was one problem. The rights belonged to someone else, an entrepreneur named Julio C\u00e9sar Lisac, who had acquired 50-year concessions for two dams in 2005.Then, one day, a Mexican engineer paid Mr. Lisac a visit.The engineer worked for the Mexican state electric utility, whose chief executive was the brother of Mr. Slim\u2019s son-in-law. It was an odd visit. The Mexican state utility cannot build or finance projects outside Mexico. Mr. Lisac said it became clear that the real suitor was Mr. Slim.Eventually, representatives of an infrastructure company Mr. Slim controls made an offer. Mr. Lisac refused.\u201cSlim\u2019s no fool,\u201d he said. \u201cHe knew we had good dams in a good location.\u201dMr. Slim wound up with the project anyway. After missing a deadline, Mr. Lisac had the concession stripped from him in 2006. Less than two years later, it was awarded to Mr. Slim\u2019s company.Mr. Lisac fought in Panama\u2019s Supreme Court \u2014 and won \u2014 but regulators refused to enforce the order. By that time, 2010, Mr. Slim had already built the power station and was operating it.Mr. Lisac suspected that Mr. Slim\u2019s growing relationship with President Ricardo Martinelli, a supermarket magnate elected in 2009, could be at play. Mr. Slim and Mr. Martinelli maintained friendly relations, including attending the final New York Yankees game of the great Panamanian pitcher Mariano Rivera together.Refusing to give up, Mr. Lisac went before a World Bank court in 2013, but it rebuffed his challenge this June, calling it a domestic Panamanian dispute.Mr. Slim denied foul play, noting that he and his company had won the concession in a government auction.\u201cThe government of Panama has won this lawsuit; it\u2019s closed,\u201d Mr. Slim said.Mr. Slim has not always prevailed. In 2011, he paid a visit to regulators who had just won a decision in Mexico\u2019s Supreme Court that was about to cost him a lot of money.The ruling cut into an important income stream for Mr. Slim, forcing him to accept vastly reduced fees from other cellphone carriers for calls into his networks. He had fought the cuts for years, and told regulators they were making a mistake.But public opinion was turning against him.Mexico also lagged its Latin American peers in expanding mobile broadband service to all its citizens, falling behind Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and even Venezuela, according to 2014 figures from the Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development, a United Nations initiative.Mr. Slim is one of the commission\u2019s co-chairmen. Asked why rural stretches of his country have no cellphone reception, he cited regulators.\u201cThey began to insist that we have a lot of market share and that it was a reason to regulate us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe suspended investment in places where we would have 100 percent of the market\u201d because it would invite more regulation.Many Mexicans felt they were paying more for less, creating an opening for the new government. As Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto took office in 2012, a plan was hatched.The government and Mexico\u2019s three major parties met secretly, choosing different locations around Mexico City, often late at night, to avoid word leaking out until the legislation was almost ready.They also took aim at Mexico\u2019s two dominant television companies, which had been equally aggressive in protecting their market shares.Once a deal was reached, lawmakers enshrined the law in the Constitution to head off Mr. Slim\u2019s legal challenges, and set up special courts to rule on them.Those who know Mr. Slim say he has long anticipated the day when his control of Mexican telecom would diminish.\u201cHe knew this was coming,\u201d said James R. Jones, a former American ambassador to Mexico during the 1990s. \u201cAnd I suspect he was planning three moves ahead.\u201dWhile Mr. Slim\u2019s dominance \u2014 and profits \u2014 may be under threat in Mexico, his wealth no longer depends on it.\u201cHe began to invest in other things,\u201d said Juan Molinar, a former communications minister, in an interview before he died last year. \u201cFollow the money.\u201dAnd for years, the money has flowed elsewhere.In the United States, the results have been mixed.

{"Headline": "Brazilians Speak Portuguese, but the Olympics Must Use French", "Date": "2016-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Micha\u00eblle Jean, secretary general of the International Organization of la Francophonie, spent a recent morning at the sultry Lagoa Olympic venue, where the world\u2019s most exciting rowing was taking place. She was not so interested in what was happening on the water.\u201cYou will notice that the commentators are not speaking French,\u201d she said, indignantly. \u201cIn the venue, none of the signs are in French.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a struggle each time you have the Olympic Games, in a different country and a different city,\u201d Ms. Jean said. \u201cWe must be there to make sure the French signs and documents and information are there. We have 3,000 athletes and a lot of people in the public from Francophone countries.\u201dThe reports tend to reflect a mixture of hopefulness and dismay.\u201cIn Beijing, all Olympic signage appeared first in French, then English and Chinese,\u201d the Sochi report says, for instance. \u201cIn Sochi, the signage addressing the international audience was trilingual, but that addressing the spectators appeared in Russian and English.\u201dIn addition, it pointed out, \u201cthe arrival of some new sports to the Olympic program (slopestyle and halfpipe) was not accompanied by a terminology sufficient for these disciplines to be discussed with French terms in the media.\u201dThe Olympics are \u201cobviously a very important showcase,\u201d said Mr. Dibango, who is also serving as a cultural ambassador, performing with Brazilian and French-speaking musicians in Rio as a way to promote the international nature of French.\u201cI see the job as being the flag-bearer of the 300 million people around the world who speak French,\u201d Mr. Dibango said.The average member of the public may have little idea that any of this is going on, but the Francophonie organization takes the issue so seriously that no sooner does one Olympics end than it starts negotiating the terms of the next one. Early discussions about French at the Rio Games were positive, Ms. Jean said, because the Brazilian government was sympathetic and because Carlos Nuzman, the president of the Brazilian organizing committee, speaks fluent French.But then the economy collapsed and the friendly government fell. When the new government came in, it had a lot on its mind, and that did not include the use of French at the Olympics. As the day of the opening ceremony approached, the Francophonie organization had no idea how the evening \u2014 traditionally a fine time for the world to hear and appreciate a lot of beautifully enunciated French spoken by important international officials \u2014 would go.It turned out to be a runaway success. All the main announcements and speeches were delivered in French, along with English and Portuguese. Even better, Ms. Jean said, \u201ceverything was announced first in French \u2014 did you notice?\u201dThe opening ceremony is one thing; the rest of the Olympics is another. Ms. Jean visited the athletes\u2019 village, only to discover that there were French-language signs in the cafeteria but nowhere else. She attributed it to Rio\u2019s budget woes \u2014 translation is expensive \u2014 and the frantic nature of pre-Games preparations. While she understood, she said, \u201cWe were very disappointed at the situation.\u201dVisitors to the Games, too, will see that the thousands of signs at the various event venues are printed only in English and Portuguese, not in French. (Not that the English signs are anything to get excited about, seeming at times to owe more to Google Translate than to a sentient being. \u201cPress the wheelchair button if you have locomotion issues,\u201d a sign next to an elevator at the media center reads. )At the rowing venue on Saturday, the events moved along so quickly that sometimes it was all the announcers could do to pack in the commentary in both Portuguese and English, never mind any other languages. In the stands, several (non-French-speaking) spectators said that, to be honest, language was not at the forefront of their minds.\u201cI hadn\u2019t really thought about it,\u201d said Amy Burba, 44, of Virginia. \u201cBut I heard the people behind us speaking French.\u201dScott MacRae, a Scottish chef who was holding a beer and wearing his Union Jack on his head as a form of sun protection, said that except at the opening and closing ceremonies, French should be kept out of the Olympics.\u201cI like the French passion,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to use French at the Olympics when you have them in a country that is not France.\u201dSeveral older-generation rowing officials at the site bemoaned the loss of French not just at the Olympics but also in sports (and in the world) in general. Americans in particular, they said, do not speak other languages and do not really want to.As Mr. Rolland talked nostalgically about the days when rowing meetings were held in French and English speakers had to listen to the translation on headphones, the Rolling Stones song \u201c(I Can\u2019t Get No) Satisfaction\u201d began playing over the loudspeakers.\u201cIt\u2019s a daily fight,\u201d he said. \u201cA daily fight.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the Olympics for which Micha\u00eblle Jean was le Grand T\u00e9moin. It was the 2012 London Games, not the 2014 Sochi Games.Victor Mather and Sam Dolnick contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Clinton? Trump? Either Way, Count on Deficit Spending to Rise", "Date": "2016-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor most voters, the idea of more government borrowing and spending is about as popular as the Zika virus. And while Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump agree on almost nothing, mainstream Democrats and Republicans alike often talk about the national debt the way prohibitionists once discussed booze.\u201cThe views of economists about the deficit are shifting,\u201d said Douglas W. Elmendorf, director of the Congressional Budget Office from 2009 to 2015 and now dean of the Kennedy School at Harvard. \u201cIf the very low level of interest rates persists for years to come, as many experts and analysts think is likely, that\u2019s a sea change for budget policy.\u201dMore borrowing might actually be healthy, many economists say, at least in the short term, by helping to elevate the economy\u2019s long-depressed growth trajectory.\u201cDeficits aren\u2019t good or bad in and of themselves,\u201d said Dean Maki, a veteran Wall Street economist now at Point72 Asset Management. \u201cIt\u2019s far more important whether the spending is worthwhile.\u201dYou might not have heard it at the party conventions in Cleveland and Philadelphia, but regardless of who wins in November, it now appears that the next president is more likely than not to end up backing, if not embracing, more deficit spending.Mr. Trump himself said in a telephone interview last week that he believed more borrowing and spending would help lift economic growth, a departure from traditional Republican economics.\u201cIt\u2019s called priming the pump,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cSometimes you have to do that a little bit to get things going. We have no choice \u2014 otherwise, we are going to die on the vine.\u201dHe added: \u201cThe economy would be crushed under Hillary. But no matter who it is, the debt is going up.\u201dMr. Trump insisted that his proposed tax overhaul would encourage American corporations to repatriate trillions in profits now stashed overseas, a windfall that he claimed would help pay for tax cuts. Faster economic growth under his policies, he said, would also ultimately reduce the deficit.But some experts, even those who agree that government borrowing can be helpful, fear that Mr. Trump will push the government to max out on debt, as many Trump properties have done over the years.\u201cDonald Trump loves debt, and whatever empire he\u2019s created, he\u2019s done it with debt,\u201d said Jeffrey Gundlach, a Los Angeles-based money manager, whose firm, DoubleLine, oversees more than $100 billion in assets. \u201cAnd in the short term, the economy could get better and grow faster.\u201dHillary Clinton has laid out ambitious, big-ticket proposals. And while she seems much less willing to borrow to the hilt than her Republican rival, the budget deficit could end up expanding if Mrs. Clinton wins in November.\u201cIf you get growth out of it, there\u2019s no debate that some deficit spending would be a good thing,\u201d said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard who has warned in the past of the risks that excessive debt poses to economic growth. \u201cIt can add to tax revenues over the long run.\u201dMike Konczal, a left-of-center economist with the Roosevelt Institute, is even more emphatic. \u201cThere is definitely room for fiscal stimulus,\u201d he said.After the financial crisis, he explained, \u201cwe needed a bigger deficit in the short term, then a turn to ensure that the recovery was strong.\u201d\u201cInstead,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat we got was a quick turn to consolidation and austerity.\u201dRepublicans, for all their railing against deficits, have actually presided over the biggest increases in debt. And Mr. Trump is well within that tradition. Mr. Gundlach compares the G.O.P. standard-bearer to another Republican who talked tough on spending but presided over a boom fueled by debt and tax cuts in the 1980s: Ronald Reagan.Hillary Clinton, while also likely to preside over a rise in federal borrowing, is far more restrained. But her proposals could quickly add up. For starters, she is calling for a $275 billion increase in infrastructure spending over five years (and many of her advisers are talking privately about a much bigger program).According to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s plan, adjusting the business tax code would \u201cfully pay for these investments.\u201d Yet a broad overhaul of corporate taxation has been talked about by both Democrats and Republicans in Washington for years with little to show for it.Mrs. Clinton has also proposed expanding coverage under the Affordable Care Act, as well as increasing access to early childhood education while heavily subsidizing in-state tuition at public colleges and universities for students whose parents earn less than $125,000 a year.But even though economists generally favor higher education spending as a spur to productivity, many forecasters concede that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s tuition aid plan could expand borrowing by several hundred billion dollars.Jacob Leibenluft, a senior policy adviser to Mrs. Clinton, emphasized that additional spending was needed, even if it meant increasing taxes.\u201cDecades of underinvestment have real economic consequences,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThis is a real opportunity that we can\u2019t afford to miss, and when we put forward these investments, we should be able to pay for them \u2014 by raising more from the wealthiest and from major corporations.\u201dThat would be a reversal from Washington\u2019s recent fiscal course, in which the budget deficit dropped from a postrecession high of $1.4 trillion in 2009 to $438 billion last year.The savings in Washington came at a price, however.From 2011 to 2014, austerity in the public sector fostered an economic headwind, reducing overall growth by nearly half a percentage point annually, economists estimate. That might not seem like much, but given the prevailing rate of just under 2 percent a year during that period, shrinking government outlays moved the needle sharply downward.Looking ahead, the key to delivering an economic payoff, Mr. Rogoff said, is to target the extra money to enhance economic productivity over the long haul, citing projects like rebuilding and improving the nation\u2019s infrastructure and improving training so more workers can develop the skills employers need.That\u2019s especially true now, when the federal government has the ability to borrow at exceptionally low interest rates. Yields on benchmark 10-year government bonds stand at just over 1.5 percent, having fallen by more than half since 2010.\u201cIf the cost of investing goes down, you should do more of it,\u201d Mr. Elmendorf said. \u201cWhile federal spending is on an unsustainable path and eventually has to be addressed, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s urgent to make cuts in spending or increase taxes.\u201dMrs. Clinton\u2019s approach, Mr. Rogoff said, would be economically superior to Mr. Trump\u2019s version, which would largely pay for tax cuts targeted at the wealthy.The problem with Mr. Trump\u2019s fiscal plan, Mr. Konczal said, isn\u2019t necessarily that it would produce a deficit \u2014 instead, it is what the government would be borrowing to pay.\u201cRunning deficits to get the economy going, that\u2019d be good,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem in Trump\u2019s tax plan is that is such a shift in power to wealth holders. It\u2019s comically large in terms of the tax cuts for the rich.\u201dBut others say that Mr. Trump \u2014 particularly if he combines tax cuts with the extensive building program he has promised, not just along the border with Mexico, but also throughout the nation\u2019s industrial heartland \u2014 could kick-start a growth surge of his own.\u201cI\u2019m not a policy maker and I don\u2019t pass judgment,\u201d said Mr. Gundlach of DoubleLine, who is among the nation\u2019s biggest bond fund managers. \u201cIn the short run, it\u2019ll have the appearance of working. Long term, if you took the national debt to $30 trillion, the consequences are unimaginable.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Unfortunately, he clings to the hope that Mr. Trump will keep his promise to release his tax returns before the election. A long record of violating commitments suggests that this vow will be broken as well.As Mitt Romney and others have said, there must be \u201ca bombshell\u201d in the Trump tax returns or they would have been made public long ago. Apparently Mr. Trump has been advised that while stonewalling carries risk, releasing the returns would doom the campaign by destroying his claims to success and generosity.Apart from its probable effect on the election, he also has to know that damage to his businesses might last for years.Mr. Sanford, like many Republicans this year, seems to be torn between party loyalty and the need to distance himself from Mr. Trump.We might all wish it otherwise, but short of a new law requiring disclosure, the odds are that the tax returns will remain hidden.JAMES W. SWINEHARTNew Rochelle, N.Y.To the Editor:Speculation is that Donald Trump won\u2019t disclose his tax returns because 1) he\u2019s not charitable; 2) he doesn\u2019t pay his fair share of taxes; or 3) he\u2019s not as rich as he claims. Maybe, but a fourth reason seems most likely to me: Mr. Trump paid no federal taxes in 2015 because his losses exceeded his taxable income.If that\u2019s the case, the resulting political ads from the Democrats would be devastating to Mr. Trump\u2019s image among his supporters and, more important from Mr. Trump\u2019s perspective, personally intolerable, given his fragile self-image.In reality TV lingo, Mr. Trump would be portrayed as \u201cthe biggest loser.\u201d If I\u2019m right, there\u2019s no chance we\u2019ll see Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns.BRUCE PARKERNewton Center, Mass.To the Editor:I can recall no presidential election in which having access to a candidate\u2019s tax returns would have given me vital information about his or her fitness for office. No need to know anything definitive about Donald Trump\u2019s personal finances; the public record indicates quite clearly that he is a narcissistic bully and a serial liar with a shockingly weak grasp of international affairs or the complexities of economic policy-making.I imagine that Mr. Trump pays no more in taxes than the tax code requires, and I do not begrudge him that. We also know that tax law enables real estate developers like him to pay far less in taxes as a percentage of their income than most middle-class households do, and that he favors making the tax code even more generous to the prodigiously affluent.We can be fairly confident that the tax policies he favors and the fiscal and monetary measures he has proposed will have ruinous consequences for the American economy. We can know all this without seeing one line of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns.If a candidate wishes to make his or her tax returns public, that is all well and good. But let\u2019s not pretend that such disclosure will tell us anything essential about what sort of president the candidate will be.GARY MONGIOVIJamaica, QueensThe writer is a professor of economics at St. John\u2019s University.To the Editor:It seems clear that Donald Trump is unwilling to reveal his tax returns because he has probably paid little or no taxes, or has even claimed a loss, not so uncommon for real estate moguls. Talk about a rigged system! And looking at his tax proposals, the system would be only more rigged under Mr. Trump\u2019s leadership.Have his loyal minions of resentful down-on-their-luck workers looked at who would be the big winners under his tax proposals? Not the little guys, for sure. And how would they react to knowing that while they have been paying their share of government costs, their man has been a free rider?Trump supporters should be calling for those tax returns as well. All the other presidential nominees for years have shared them.ELAINE ERICHSONStamford, Conn.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sexual Harassment Training With Roger Ailes", "Date": "2016-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe details both women lay out portray Fox as a place where sexual harassers roam free, grabbing or ogling whatever they fancy, with consequences brought to bear only on the victims who speak up.It\u2019s been a very long time, however, since the United States was asked to grapple with this fact. A quarter-century ago, a law professor named Anita Hill described in close detail before the United States Senate \u2014 and the American public, via our televisions \u2014 the harassment she says she endured at the hands of Clarence Thomas, now a Supreme Court justice. It was the first time the public had to face the lived reality of harassment in such a visible way.Sexual harassment was already illegal. A landmark Supreme Court case in 1986 had recognized it as prohibited by the laws of the land. But it took Ms. Hill\u2019s testimony and the backlash it unleashed for the country to face the pervasive nature of sexual harassment.Now, most Americans can tell you what sexual harassment is, thanks in large part to that testimony. It\u2019s still illegal. But it\u2019s nowhere near extinct, as made painfully clear by the lawsuits against Mr. Ailes.Just as when America was transfixed by Ms. Hill\u2019s testimony, the allegations against Mr. Ailes represent another lesson in what harassment looks like, how it works and just how many people are affected by it.Ms. Carlson\u2019s case, and the increasing volume of similar complaints against Mr. Ailes, could start to bridge the gap. When other women see Mr. Ailes leave his position of power in the wake of the suit, they may be emboldened to speak up \u2014 as Ms. Tantaros was. The shock of these women\u2019s stories has made the horror of enduring sexual harassment on the job real.We\u2019ve come a long way in understanding that harassment should be purged from our workplaces, but we\u2019ve done little to actually purge it. Maybe Roger Ailes can help with that.Bryce Covert is the economic policy editor at ThinkProgress and a contributor to The Nation.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s driving away the unique, friendly places that make living in the city worth the effort.It\u2019s not a new problem \u2014 in years past my husband and I mourned the loss of the Empire Diner in Chelsea and Vercesi Hardware. But it seems to be picking up speed. In the last few weeks, by my count, about a dozen institutions have announced closures. Some of them sold things you simply cannot get anywhere else.Where else will New York\u2019s quilt-makers go for supplies once the City Quilter, on West 25th Street, shuts down in October? New York Central Art Supply had the best drawing paper in the city. What will replace it?AR Trapp Opticians, on Madison Avenue near Rockefeller Center, had a national clientele because of its old-fashioned, unusual eyeglass frames. First, its landlord rented the shop next door to a competitor, then raised the rent.In the Flatiron district, a charmingly grumpy store called Krup\u2019s Kitchen and Bath carried old-fashioned appliances alongside sleek new European luxury brands and hard-to-find refrigerators and stoves from mainstream American suppliers in odd sizes to replace those built into tiny New York kitchens. Krup\u2019s, too, is gone.The wave is lapping beyond Manhattan, too \u2014 deep into Brooklyn, patrons mourned when Rocco\u2019s Calamari, an Italian cafeteria that, despite its name, served much more than fried squid, closed its doors.A happier tale is the story of one beloved institution pushed out of my neighborhood by rising rents: the Union Square Cafe, which Danny Meyer opened in 1985 at 21 East 16th Street, long before he became a globe-trotting restaurateur. Fortunately, it is reopening soon on Park Avenue South, near the farmers\u2019 market that supplies many of its ingredients. But Mr. Meyer, with his other restaurants and Shake Shack empire, had the resources and inclination to find another location. Few other business owners have either.It\u2019s not just a matter of my personal convenience or quirky shopping habits. The usually well-paying, stable jobs lost when family-owned shops close will not be replaced if chain stores with fast-changing work forces come in. And since many chains are already here, a lot of shop fronts will remain empty, producing no revenue \u2014 and no street life \u2014 at all.It\u2019s not just rent that\u2019s driving these businesses out. They emerged out of an older era, in which goods were distributed to retailers by carts, then small trucks coursing through alleys. In New York, however, the efficient street grid doesn\u2019t have any alleys, so deliveries have to take place on busy city streets.\u201cIn an economy-of-scale world, where traffic itself has become a valuable commodity, the mom-and-pop store suffers,\u201d as a friend, the investment adviser Frazer Rice, pointed out to me. And, he added: \u201cThe tax and regulatory climate for a small business is nothing short of punishing.

He\u2019s also pushing for a cultural preservation program, which would protect businesses that have contributed significantly to a neighborhood\u2019s social fabric.They\u2019re all great ideas; unfortunately, the impending extinction of New York\u2019s small-business storefronts doesn\u2019t seem to be on any politician\u2019s radar. It should be: Our city\u2019s uniqueness comes from the little shops and restaurants many of us have been taking for granted for far too long.An Op-Ed essay on Saturday about recently closed storefronts in New York City misstated the status of the City Quilter.

{"Headline": "States Vie to Shield the Wealth of the 1 Percent", "Date": "2016-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI have had a Google news alert on that for a couple years,\u201d Mr. Oshins said as he discussed the case from his office in a squat pink complex about a 20-minute drive from the Las Vegas Strip. What animates Mr. Oshins is not the juicy marital feud, but the legal arcana governing a trust in Delaware where the Kloiber family parked assets worth hundreds of million of dollars, sheltered from estate taxes.Although most out-of-town visitors are drawn to the city\u2019s roulette wheels and slot machines, Mr. Oshins and a battalion of tax lawyers, accountants, advisers, trust administrators and bankers cater to an elite clientele that insists on a much more reliable way to build a fortune.With their backing, Nevada has stoked an aggressive rivalry among a smattering of states to babysit the wealth of the nation\u2019s top 1 percent, pressing public officials to pass laws, streamline regulations, lower fees and replace D.M.V.-level service with concierge treatment.Yet even as more and more states seek ways to help the richest Americans protect their wealth from creditors, divorcing spouses and children, as well as some federal and state tax collectors, critics worry that the effort to attract the lucrative trust business is turning into a competitive game of giveaway.\u201cThere is no doubt that many, many jurisdictions are committed to being at the bottom,\u201d said Edward McCaffrey, a professor at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law. \u201cI think the real question now is: \u2018Where is the bottom?\u2019\u201dThe federal government leaves it to each state to draw up its own trust laws, and several have tried to go as far as they can without inciting accusations that they are abetting tax evasion or hiding assets, he said. But in pushing the envelope, they can also run into challenges from courts in other states, including the Kloibers\u2019 home of Kentucky, that have different statutes governing trusts.Still, Nevada \u201cis definitely the most aggressive in my experience in terms of asset protection,\u201d Mr. McCaffrey said.Starting with the absence of any state income tax and resilient secrecy protections, Nevada has added a passel of laws and regulations intended to lure trust business. Individuals who establish so-called irrevocable trusts have more flexibility to transfer assets to a new trust with more favorable terms. Creditors are blocked from access to money held in trusts (making the arrangement also popular among doctors, who worry a malpractice case could bankrupt them). And what are known as dynasty trusts allow the wealthy to pass their fortunes from generation to generation for hundreds of years without paying estate taxes.Defenders of the industry won what was characterized as a \u201cdo or die\u201d battle in 2013, fending off legislation that would have opened up Nevada trusts to future claims from spouses and domestic partners for property settlements, alimony or child support. And Nevada has only a narrow two-year window for creditors to make a claim against a trust\u2019s assets.\u201cIt\u2019s against the law in this state to conceal assets from legitimate creditors,\u201d said Mark A. Hutchison, Nevada\u2019s Republican lieutenant governor, a lawyer himself.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to be aware of phantom threats that could blow up our industry,\u201d he added.Phantom threats, he said, include recent suspicions \u2014 after the leak of the Panama Papers \u2014 that citizens and foreigners are illegally hiding assets in the state.If the revelations were a source of embarrassment, however, they were also a source of free worldwide publicity. \u201cIt\u2019s actually helped us, believe it or not,\u201d said Greg Crawford, president of the Alliance Trust Company in Reno, explaining that Nevada was not as well known internationally for its asset-protection policies as Delaware. \u201cI\u2019ve had more calls from people overseas, established families, who are interested in Nevada.\u201dMr. Crawford disputed the idea that the state\u2019s rules were abetting criminal activities. \u201cThe honest, ethical taxpaying people around the world who simply want privacy are happy to put assets in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cCrooks know they can be confiscated, so it actually serves as a weeding-out process.\u201dMonitoring development in other states and bulking up asset protection laws, said Mr. Hutchison, the lieutenant governor, has dependable bipartisan support. \u201cThe trust business is a big business,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve always viewed it as a way to stimulate the economy.\u201dAlthough trusts generate little public revenue or direct investment in the state, they do provide a steady stream of work for those in the industry. Supporters also say they generate indirect investment by drawing wealthy people who spend money and might invest later on.Robert H. Sitkoff, a Harvard Law School professor, said that in smaller-population states like Delaware, Nevada, South Dakota and Alaska, trust and estate lawyers \u201care an effective and important lobby in a way that would be much harder to replicate in a place like New York, a big state with lots going on.\u201dWith the competition so intense, each state tries to exploit marginal advantages and highlight rivals\u2019 weaknesses.The marketing pitch is not always about keeping up with the neighbors, however. Even as Nevada and Delaware blocked ex-spouses with claims for child support, for example, New Hampshire decided not to follow suit.\u201cWe have reviewed that and said that\u2019s not our policy,\u2019\u201d said William F.

{"Headline": "Thailand Bombings Kill 4 and Wound Dozens, Most at Tourist Sites", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBANGKOK \u2014 A series of bombings struck five provinces in Thailand, mostly at sites popular with tourists, on Thursday and Friday morning, in what a senior Thai official called a coordinated wave of attacks. Four people were killed and dozens wounded, the police said.Gen. Prawit Wongsuwan, a deputy prime minister in Thailand\u2019s military-run government, said the attacks were \u201cabsolutely conducted by the same network.\u201d\u201cI believe so,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut the investigation is unclear on who actually did it, what are the reasons behind it.\u201dAnother senior official later described the bombings as \u201clocal sabotage,\u201d not terrorism. No group has claimed responsibility for the blasts.Two bombs went off at the Hua Hin resort in Prachuap Khiri Khan Province late Thursday evening, killing one woman and wounding 21 other people, the Thai police said. Hours earlier, a bombing near a market in Trang Province killed one person and wounded six.On Friday morning, more explosions struck in Hua Hin, killing another person and wounding three, and at the popular resort island of Phuket, where one person was wounded, the police said. Two bombs also went off in the province of Surat Thani, leaving one person dead, and two near a market in Phang Nga, a southern province, though officials said there were no casualties there.Police officials said several of the bombs were detonated by cellphone.A spokesman for the national police, Maj. Gen. Piyapan Pingmuang, said there was no evidence of a connection to international terrorism. \u201cThis is different from the terrorism that has taken place in many countries,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is local sabotage.\u201dZachary Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington who researches politics and security in Southeast Asia, doubted that southern insurgents were behind the blasts. \u201cIt\u2019s been years since they have been able to pull off coordinated attacks across multiple cities and provinces, and when they have, it\u2019s always been confined to the deep south,\u201d he said in an email.\u201cThe restrictions on campaigning ahead of the referendum must convince some that only extralegal means can be effective,\u201d Mr. Abuza said. While many of the bombings were in tourist areas, he said, they did not seem intended to kill large numbers of people, suggesting that the intent was to hurt the tourist-dependent economy.Friday is the birthday of the queen, Sirikit, a national holiday, and some of the bombs were reported to have gone off after the national anthem, which is customarily played at 8 a.m. Many people had gone to Hua Hin, a coastal resort on the Gulf of Thailand, in anticipation of the holiday. Queen Sirikit and King Bhumibol Adulyadej have a palace there, though they are both ill and hospitalized in Bangkok.Col. Sansern Kaewkamnerd, a spokesman for the prime minister\u2019s office, urged Thais to celebrate the holiday as usual. \u201cThey don\u2019t want people to go out, travel or spend money,\u201d he said in a televised interview, referring to the bombers. \u201cThey want to scare off investors. They don\u2019t want tourists to come to Thailand.\u201dThe explosions Thursday night in Hua Hin, which occurred about a half-hour apart, were in an area of bars and nightclubs popular with foreign tourists. At least nine foreigners were wounded in the second explosion, which went off at a crowded intersection, according to Suthipong Klai-udom, a district official.Mr. Suthipong said that Germans, Swiss and Italians were among the wounded, and that the woman who died was a Thai street vendor whose cart was near one of the explosions. He said the bombs had been hidden in plant pots and detonated by cellphone.Austin Ramzy contributed reporting from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Trump Wrecking Both Parties?", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn case you weren\u2019t convinced Democrats are becoming the cosmopolitan elite party.The table showed support for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump by income and education. It leads to a clear conclusion.Trump is competitive among the less affluent and those without college degrees, among whom he is behind by 3 and 4 points respectively. But Clinton is crushing him among college graduates (57-34) and among those making $50,000 or more (55-37).The larger conclusion from the data is that the Trump campaign \u2014 both through the support Trump generates among working-class whites and the opposition he generates among better educated, more affluent voters \u2014 has accelerated the ongoing transformation of the Democratic Party. Once a class-based coalition, the party has become an alliance between upscale well-educated whites and, importantly, ethnic and racial minorities, many of them low income.\u201cThe voice of the left \u2014 especially the old social democratic left \u2014 has lost force in recent years,\u201d Ian Buruma, a professor of democracy, human rights, and journalism at Bard College, wrote me in an email.This is partly because leftwing parties since the 1960s began to switch their attention from working class struggle to identity politics.There is, Buruma went on,a common anxiety about the effects of globalism, multinational corporate power, immigration. More and more people feel unrepresented. When they complained about immigration or the bewildering changes effected by a global economy, such people were too easily dismissed as racists and bigots. Now they blame the \u201cliberal elites\u201d for all their anxieties.Rodrik does not let up:They abdicated too easily to market fundamentalism and bought in to its central tenets. Worse still, they led the hyper-globalization movement at crucial junctures. The enthroning of free capital mobility \u2013 especially of the short-term kind \u2013 as a policy norm by the European Union, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and the IMF was arguably the most fateful decision for the global economy in recent decades.Left policy makers and analysts, Rodrik writes, facethe paradox that earlier waves of reforms from the left \u2013 Keynesianism, social democracy, the welfare state \u2013 both saved capitalism from itself and effectively rendered themselves superfluous.If liberal public policy intellectuals are unable develop \u201ca clear program to refashion capitalism and globalization for the twenty-first century,\u201d Rodrik warns, \u201cthe field will be left wide open for populists and far-right groups who will lead the world \u2013 as they always have \u2013 to deeper division and more frequent conflict.\u201dincreasingly disconnected from working-class America. I mean that in a very specific sense. Our residences are increasingly segregated by class. Our schools are increasingly segregated by class. Our extended families are increasingly separated by class.Most culture-war conflicts involve sexuality, gender, or reproduction. Social issues spurred a partisan realignment by changing who considered themselves Democrats and Republicans. Over decades, socially conservative working-class whites migrated from the Democratic Party to join the Republican Party, especially in the South. Socially moderate Republicans, especially on the East Coast, shifted to the Democratic coalition.The result, in Lind\u2019s view, is an emerging Republican Party dominated byworking-class whites, based in the South and West and suburbs and exurbs everywhere. They will favor universal, contributory social insurance systems that benefit them and their families and reward work effort \u2014 programs like Social Security and Medicare. But they will tend to oppose means-tested programs for the poor whose benefits they and their families cannot enjoy.This shift, Lind points out, will powerfully alter the Democratic coalition, too. The Democrats will becomeeven more of an alliance of upscale, progressive whites with blacks and Latinos, based in large and diverse cities. They will think of the U.S. as a version of their multicultural coalition of distinct racial and ethnic identity groups writ large. Many younger progressives will take it for granted that moral people are citizens of the world, equating nationalism and patriotism with racism and fascism.From this vantage point, Trump and the pro-social insurance populist right that has emerged in much of Europe are as much the result of the vacuum created by traditional liberal political parties as they are a function of the neglect of working class interests by conservatives.You can look at the populist insurgency spearheaded by Donald Trump as either a corrective or a threat to mainstream Republican orthodoxy.On the threat side, Trump has exploited a racist and authoritarian vein in American politics.There are, however, major hurdles for anyone determined to capitalize on the Trump campaign in order to force an internal realignment of the Republican Party.Trump has already demonstrated the ability to leap over one of those hurdles: the social conservatism of the Christian Right.Trump\u2019s political base was among the party\u2019s white working- and middle-class voters \u2014 precisely the voters who had originally flocked to Wallace and then to Nixon, who had been attracted by Perot and Buchanan, but who now felt that they had found a champion in Trump. He had become the voice of Middle American radicalism and more broadly of the white Americans who felt left behind by globalization and the shift to a postindustrial economy.Inglehart and Norris view animosity to cosmopolitan cultural trends as a driving force. They see right populism asa loose political ideology emphasizing faith in the \u201cdecent,\u201d \u201cordinary\u201d or \u201clittle\u201d people over the corrupt political and corporate establishment; nationalist interests (Us) over cosmopolitanism cooperation across borders (Them); protectionist policies regulating the movement of trade, people and finance over global free trade; xenophobia over tolerance of multiculturalism; strong individual leadership over diplomatic bargaining and flexible negotiations; isolationism in foreign and defense policies over international engagement; traditional sex roles for women and men over more fluid gender identities and roles, and traditional over progressive values.I asked Judis and Norris whether the Trump campaign provides a model for a new Republican future. Both answered in the negative.Judis wrote back:In order to mimic the European parties, the G.O.P. would have to slough off its business wing, and that is inconceivable to me, especially with Citizens United. The European right does not have strong business support.Norris looks at another angle: the way in which the populist right is, at its core, a protest movement that is not well equipped for governing:In Europe, populist parties which enter government coalitions often do lose popular support by disappointing their followers. Moreover, their electoral fortunes are usually erratic, like flash parties which come and go with the leader.Despite these difficulties, there are some conservatives who intend to capitalize on currents unleashed by the Trump campaign to try to make the Republican Party more attractive to lower wage workers.These positions include the disavowal of \u201cmass deportations\u201d and the promotion of \u201cthe economic benefits of legalizing longtime workers who are in the country illegally,\u201d as well as arguing for \u201cthe benefits of global trade agreements,\u201d with help for displaced workers.Here\u2019s the problem with that agenda. As both Judis and Norris stress, the anti-immigrant message has been crucial to the growth of the European right and to the Trump campaign.In Europe, Judis writes in his book,as populist parties gained support for their stand against immigration, they widened their political base. The first populist parties, such as the National Front and the Freedom Party, had been petit-bourgeoisie parties. Their members were drawn primarily from small towns in the countryside, and were small business proprietors and small farmers. Thanks to the reaction to immigration and neoliberalism, what had been petit-bourgeois parties had become workers\u2019 parties.Judis defines neoliberalism this way:In the United States, neoliberalism meant the modification, but not wholesale abandonment, of New Deal liberalism \u2014 support for the New Deal safety net, but beyond that, priority to market imperatives \u2014 while in Europe, it meant the partial return to older free market liberalism.Theda Skocpol, a professor of government at Harvard, studies both the Tea Party movement and the rise of Trump. She is dubious about reformocon strategy:The \u201cintellectuals\u2019 \u201d idea that somehow the G.O.P. is going to start responding to the economic security worries of blue collar/lower middle class Republicans is largely a fantasy. And that is largely because the core of Trump\u2019s support is raw nativism.In the long run, then, the significance of the Trump campaign may well prove to be the changes he has wrought in the Democratic Party.As Trump flails in every self-destructive fashion conceivable, the odds increasingly point to a Clinton victory. But if she wins, how well will Clinton be able to govern with a base split between the well-to-do, many of whom seek to protect their enclaves against the interests, needs and classically American ambitions of the other half of the party \u2014 low-to-moderate income African-Americans and Hispanics and the truly poor?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Adopted Koreans, Stymied in Search of Birth Parents, Find Hope in a Cotton Swab", "Date": "2016-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Five years ago, Sun Mi Stapel, a claims handler at a Dutch insurance company, began searching for her South Korean birth family.Ms. Stapel first turned to the Dutch adoption agency that had placed her with her adoptive parents in Krommenie, the Netherlands, where she grew up. Then she tried Korea Social Service, which had handled the Korean side of her adoption. Last year, she finally obtained her adoption files, but they were missing vital information.She traveled to Seoul, appearing on a morning television show with her baby photos and asking viewers to call a hotline with any information. She registered for a national database for missing people. She distributed fliers in the neighborhood around her orphanage in Incheon, where she was born, and visited nursing homes and community centers there in hopes of finding someone who knew her parents.No one did.So on a recent Tuesday afternoon, Ms. Stapel, 46, went to a guesthouse for adoptees in Seoul, where a volunteer rubbed the inside of her cheek with a cotton swab, dropped the swab in a tube and shipped it to a lab in Texas, where her DNA will be analyzed and uploaded to a website that scans submitted samples for genetic matches.The result could link her to her birth family and fill in some of the blanks of her personal history.\u201cI want to know the simple things,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen is my real date of birth? Who is my father? Who is my mother? Do I have siblings? Do I look like somebody?\u201dMany South Korean adoptees who have the same questions are turning to DNA testing to circumvent what has long been a tortuous and often fruitless process.For years, South Korea was the world\u2019s leading baby exporter. Since the 1950s, it has sent about 200,000 children abroad for adoption, including about 150,000 to the United States.From 2012 to 2015, fewer than 15 percent of adoptees who asked to reunite with their birth parents were able to do so, according to Korean government figures.For many, DNA testing offers a way around the bureaucratic hurdles and flawed records.Monica Toudahl Knudsen, 33, who grew up in the Jutland peninsula, in Denmark, also took the test. She has been searching for her birth family since 2012.According to her adoption file, her parents were teenage sweethearts who could not afford to raise her. On a previous trip to Seoul, she had visited the site of the midwife clinic where she was born. It now houses a cafe and fried chicken restaurant.She feels grateful for her life in Denmark, where she is a chef. If she is ever able to meet her birth parents, she said, \u201cI just want to thank them for letting me go.\u201dThe DNA testing movement has been largely financed by Thomas Park Clement, a Korean adoptee who now lives in Manhattan and in Bloomington, Ind. A scientist who founded Mectra Labs, a medical manufacturing company, he has pledged to spend $1 million on DNA kits to give away.\u201cI have throughout the years experienced so many of my fellow Korean adoptees\u2019 frustrations with birth relative searches,\u201d he said in a recent interview. \u201cDNA is shortcutting the search process and bringing all parties in direct communication with each other.\u201dHe has donated 2,550 kits to Korean adoptees and Korean War veterans in the United States. Some of the veterans are the fathers of the first wave of South Korea\u2019s international adoptees. He has also given 450 to 325Kamra, a volunteer organization started last year, to distribute in South Korea.When testing works, it is remarkably efficient.This month, 325Kamra announced its first match between a Korean birth mother and an American adoptee. Within 48 hours, the adoptee, Kyung Eun Davidson, 33, of Everett, Wash., was speaking to her mother for the first time in 30 years.The biggest obstacles to finding more matches are the databases themselves: There is no single consolidated database widely available both to Korean birth parents and to overseas Korean adoptees. Databases used by Americans and Koreans are incompatible and cannot share information.The South Korean police collect DNA samples for their national database of missing people. Adoptees and birth parents are eligible to submit DNA for this database, and many do, but not nearly enough.The testing done by 325Kamra goes into the databases of Family Tree DNA, a Houston-based DNA testing company, and GEDMatch, a service that scans for genetic matches from three popular testing companies: Family Tree, 23andMe and AncestryDNA. Ms. Davidson used 23andMe, her birth mother took the test with 325Kamra in South Korea, and they were connected by GEDMatch.Another limitation is the parents. While an estimated 1,000 adoptees have submitted their DNA for matching on GEDMatch, only 100 birth parents have taken tests with 325Kamra. Many are afraid to come forward because of the shame associated with adoption in South Korea, where they risk being shunned by their families and communities.Stigma has always been a factor in South Korea\u2019s international adoptions, which began in the mid-1950s, when the children of Korean women and American servicemen were ostracized for their mixed racial heritage. Later, the shame of single parenthood fueled abandonments, and the poor local economy favored international adoption.But by 1988, the country\u2019s reputation as the leading baby exporter had become a national embarrassment, and the government introduced a quota system for international adoptions and began promoting domestic ones.Adoptees are not the only ones placing their hopes in DNA tests.Last month, Song Chang-sook, 89, traveled 200 miles from Pusan with his caregiver to take a DNA test in Seoul. Having heard about the testing on a morning television program, he was searching for the three sons he relinquished for adoption more than 40 years ago.When his wife died of typhoid fever in 1970, his mother-in-law decided that the children should be given up for adoption rather than raised by a single father. He gave up his three sons: Won Ho, born in 1965; Won Young, born in 1967; and Won Hee, born in 1968.Five years later, he returned to the adoption agency, Holt International, asking for their whereabouts. He inquired many more times after that. At one point, someone told him that his sons were living together in France. But Holt was prohibited from disclosing personal information about the three boys. The 2012 adoption law that gives adoptees the right to petition for their birth records offers no such benefit to the parents.Mr. Song thinks about the last time he saw his children, on Nov. 3, 1971. The year before, his oldest son, Won Ho, had been hospitalized for a month with a broken shoulder from a car accident.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Transporting the Dead: A Booming but Lightly Regulated Industry", "Date": "2016-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEven when the dead bodies Zachary Smeltz lifts for a living are hefty, he makes sure to handle even the burliest corpse in a gentle manner, masking any exertion. \u201cTreat every case like that\u2019s your mom that you\u2019re transferring,\u201d is the motto Mr. Smeltz imparts on the staff of the mortuary transport business he owns that sends him all over New Jersey and Pennsylvania and to other locales, picking up bodies.Mr. Smeltz is part of an unusual niche in the labor market: He is among a proliferating group of independent entrepreneurs capitalizing on the need to collect the dead from houses, hospitals, morgues and accident scenes. It is a little-known link in the chain of death-to-final-resting-place that is growing as places like funeral homes and hospices as well as governments cut their budgets and increasingly outsource the transport of the dead.A class-action suit unfolding in California has opened a window onto this often lightly regulated industry: Charons of the highway, who shuttle corpses from one place to another. While in some places, like New York, such work must be carried out under the auspices of licensed funeral directors, in others, like New Jersey and Pennsylvania, private contractors without any special permits may pick up bodies. These Uber-like services require little more than a driver\u2019s license, a strong stomach and a willingness to be ready to go at a moment\u2019s notice.\u201cThere are no holidays in the business,\u201d said Mr. Smeltz, 31, who owns Smeltz\u2019s Mortuary Transportation Company in Lykens, Pa. \u201cThere is no banker\u2019s hours on death.\u201dWhen it comes to transporting the dead, most people think of a black hearse, with its tinted, curtained windows, ferrying loved ones to their final rest. But before that last, dignified drive, bodies may move far more times \u2014 from a deathbed to a coroner\u2019s office to a funeral home. In this barely noticed process, the mode of choice is often a nondescript van.In California, a group of drivers has filed suit against their employer, saying they received little training and were forced to remain on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, using vans they were required to provide and retrofit with a gurney. The drivers said they even had to provide their own body bags.\u201cThis lawsuit is important, but litigation is often a temporary fix,\u201d Peter Rukin, a lawyer representing the workers, said. \u201cI would ultimately like to see industry-specific state regulation ensuring that workers who perform removals for county coroners\u2019 offices and the private funeral industry receive appropriate labor and health and safety protections.\u201dThough it is a shadowy and sometimes controversial industry, funeral directors and those who operate the body transport companies say state and local governments are increasingly turning to private contractors as a cost-saving measure.George R. Kelder, the executive director of the New Jersey State Funeral Directors Association, argued that the business did not require special certification.\u201cI am not certain that the mere transport of remains requires a license or a registration,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that would add an expense.\u201dAnd yet, he acknowledged, without licensing mandates, it is impossible to ensure drivers get essential training, including about how to protect themselves from pathogens. \u201cJust like the police and first responders, they have to be trained in personal protection,\u201d Mr. Kelder said. \u201cIt\u2019s not merely lifting up the weight.\u201dOthers in the funeral industry contend the body transport business should be more strictly regulated.\u201cThere are some states you don\u2019t even have to be a funeral director,\u201d said Scott M. Schmidt, the president of the New York State Association of County Coroners and Medical Examiners. \u201cYou just hang a shingle on a wall and you\u2019re an undertaker all of a sudden.\u201dRules regarding who may transport remains are set on a state level and vary widely, so determining how many require special certification for drivers of remains is difficult.New York State has some of the stricter requirements: Generally, the only people allowed to transport bodies are licensed funeral directors or someone designated by a coroner or a medical examiner. In New York City, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner has dedicated drivers to collect bodies, according to a spokeswoman.The purpose of New York\u2019s stringent regulation, Mr. Schmidt said, is \u201cso you\u2019re not sending out Joe the Plumber to pick up Grandma at the nursing home.\u201dCurtis Johnson, 63, was a butcher before he became a body transporter in 2012 for Serenity Transportation, a company based in California that employs over 70 drivers, and is a defendant in the lawsuit. California is among the states that do not require drivers to be specially certified to transport human remains.Shifts for drivers often begin with a text message of a location. \u201cIt\u2019s like a firefighter, you jump up, throw your clothes on and you go,\u201d said Mr. Johnson, who says he received rudimentary training on manipulating a body, but no other instruction such as counseling for the difficult situations that are endemic to the job. \u201cSometimes people get angry at you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re taking their loved one away. They are very stoic, they are very together, and as soon as you start to move that body, they fall apart.\u201dJeff Hubins, a lawyer defending Serenity, said that the drivers were correctly classified as independent contractors and therefore properly compensated.Michael Neel runs First Call Care, a transport company based in Monmouth County, N.J. Though the state does not require certification to transport bodies, Mr. Neel is a licensed funeral director, a designation that he feels gives him a competitive edge. He has about dozen clients for whom he picks up bodies in a van that he also uses for chores like grocery shopping.\u201cWith the economy and everything, funeral homes and other places are not hiring full time,\u201d he said. \u201cThis gives them the opportunity to call me when they need me and they can save money that way.\u201dBut even some drivers who work for licensed funeral directors, like Kevin S. Courtney, 50, a driver in Clarksburg, W.Va., who drove for a funeral home, said the business could sometimes feel crude. His job interview consisted of one question: Did he have a driver\u2019s license?\u201cIt seems to me that there\u2019s probably not a lot of people rushing to take this job, just because of the whole ick factor,\u201d he said. He quit after just a month in 2012, believing it was undignified. \u201cI thought there would be this beautiful waxed-down vehicle, all velvet in the back,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a van that if it drove through my neighborhood I\u2019d maybe call the police.\u201dMr. Smeltz, the driver from Pennsylvania, transports bodies in a Dodge Caravan. The manner, not the mode, is what matters, he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t stop at the hardware store with a body in the back to get something,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s a hearse or a van or a Suburban, it\u2019s still the way you treat that person from Point A to Point B.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fifty States of Anxiety", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFeeling worried? These days, much of America is.Over the past eight years, Google search rates for anxiety have more than doubled. They are higher this year than they have been in any year since Google searches were first tracked in 2004.So far, 2016 has been tops for searches for driving anxiety, travel anxiety, separation anxiety, anxiety at work, anxiety at school and anxiety at home.Americans have also become increasingly terrified of the morning. Searches for \u201canxiety in the morning\u201d have risen threefold over the past decade. But this is nothing compared with the fear of night. Searches for \u201canxiety at night\u201d have risen ninefold.Over the past few weeks, I\u2019ve taken a break from worrying about my own anxiety to studying our country\u2019s. While I am not sure I totally nailed down why anxiety seems to have risen so much during the Obama era, I did learn a lot.The places where anxiety is highest are not where I would have expected. When I was growing up, if you had asked me which people were the most anxious, I would have said New York Jews. And a decade of interacting with our country\u2019s urban intelligentsia, Jewish and otherwise, has confirmed that pretty much all of us are a neurotic mess.But data has now given me a window into how the rest of the country lives. They\u2019re even worse off. Google searches for anxiety tend to be higher in places with lower levels of education, lower median incomes and a larger part of the population living in rural areas. While the state of New York does have above-average anxiety, it is actually higher in upstate New York than it is in New York City.Searches for panic attacks are overwhelmingly concentrated in less educated, poorer parts of the country, particularly Appalachia and the South. Test-taking anxiety is highest in Arkansas. Searches for \u201canxiety about death\u201d are highest in Kentucky.The epicenter of anxiety, according to Google, is Presque Isle, Me., where fewer than 20 percent of adults hold a bachelor\u2019s degree.The data also suggest that some things I thought for sure would be huge drivers of anxiety turn out not to play much of a role at all. One example: terrorism.I tested how anxiety searches changed after the five largest recent terrorist attacks in the European Union \u2014 Madrid, London, Paris, Brussels and Nice \u2014 each of which killed or injured more than 100 people. In the weeks that followed, there was no rise in anxiety searches in the country that was attacked. I also tested whether anxiety searches rose in Boston after the marathon bombing. They didn\u2019t. Ditto for Orlando, Fla. after the nightclub shooting.Of course, it may be that terrorist attacks terrify people without making them Google about their anxiety, but it still surprised me.Another potential source of anxiety that doesn\u2019t pop up in the data: Donald J. Trump. Many people, I assumed, are anxious over the prospect that Mr. Trump could become president of the United States. And I thought they would express this anxiety through Google. However, while anxiety searches have continued their decade-long rise this year, there was no noticeable change in this trend as the prospect of Mr. Trump\u2019s actually winning became more plausible. Nor have Democratic-leaning parts of the country witnessed an unusually large rise in anxiety searches.I also thought Mr. Trump\u2019s fear-mongering was helping to create fear. Anxiety must have risen after Mr. Trump\u2019s dystopian acceptance speech at the Republican convention last month, right? Not so. There was no increase in searches related to anxiety or panic attacks.In fact, the data suggest that fear-mongering politicians may not create all that much anxiety. Consider the 2004 presidential election between George W. Bush and John Kerry, in which the incumbent continually emphasized the threat of terrorism. I compared anxiety searches in the summer and fall of 2004 in swing states and non-swing states. Swing states, where advertising was concentrated, would have been exposed to far more fear-based messages. But they did not show more anxiety or panic attacks.I did find two factors that cause anxiety. The first \u2014 and this is hardly a surprise \u2014 is a major recession. States that were more deeply affected by the Great Recession saw bigger increases in anxiety during and after the recession. I estimate that each percentage point increase in unemployment is associated with a 1.4 percent increase in anxiety.The second was not something I had thought about, so let me explain how I even stumbled upon the possibility. Google Correlate is a service that makes data available to researchers so that they can test which searches are most frequently made in the weeks a particular search is made. For example, at certain times of year, when people are searching a lot for \u201csweaters,\u201d Google Correlate tells us they are also searching for \u201cscarves,\u201d \u201cfleece pajama pants\u201d and \u201chot cocoa.\u201dA few weeks ago, I put \u201cpanic attack\u201d in Google Correlate, and one of the highest correlated search queries was \u201copiate withdrawal.\u201d Panic attacks are a known symptom of opiate withdrawal, although looking at the striking correlations here, I wonder if they may be an even more common symptom than we had realized.The places with high opiate prescription rates \u2014 and high search rates for opiate withdrawal \u2014 are among the places with the highest search rates for panic attacks. These areas include Appalachia and the South.During years in which many people complained of opiate withdrawal, many people also complained about panic attacks. Interestingly, searches for opiate withdrawal and panic attack have continued to rise over the past few years, even as opiate prescription rates have finally fallen.Searches for opiate withdrawal consistently start high at the beginning of the year. They mostly drop through the year, although they rise in the summer and then surge around Christmas. New Year\u2019s resolutions and doctor vacation schedules may play roles in these patterns. Searches for panic attacks follow a similar pattern, although there is less of a rise around Christmas.To be honest, I still don\u2019t know what to make of this huge rise in anxiety-related searches. I have a lot of questions. Has fear of a black president contributed? Is anxiety contagious \u2014 if someone loses her job and gets anxious, are her kids and friends likely to become more anxious as well? Is anxiety subject to tipping points and bubbles? How much of a role is the return of heroin playing in the rise of panic attacks?Before I look into this further, though, I will take a break from working and instead indulge in my own favorite 2016 habit. I\u2019m going to pace the streets of New York and fret.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Korean Missile Defense Deal Appears to Sour China\u2019s Taste for K-Pop", "Date": "2016-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Has K-pop become one of the first victims of a recent fraying of relations between China and South Korea?South Korean popular culture is huge in China, which in recent years has become the largest export market for the South Korean entertainment industry. But in the past week, several events in China featuring music and television stars have been called off, and those cancellations have caused jitters in both countries and sent the stock prices of some of South Korea\u2019s top entertainment companies tumbling.The cancellations may have been coincidental, but several employees at South Korean and Chinese media companies, who requested anonymity because they feared jeopardizing business in the future, expressed worries that there had been official pressure to put some South Korean projects on hold.A fan event in Beijing with the South Korean stars Kim Woo-bin and Suzy Bae of the television series \u201cUncontrollably Fond\u201d was postponed last week after the Chinese host, the online streaming company Youku, received a notice from the police bureau in Beijing suggesting that it delay the event, according to a Youku employee.Kim Hyong-woo, a spokesman for JYP Entertainment, one of the South Korean companies whose share prices have suffered, said it had \u201cnothing to say except that we are watching the situation.\u201d Other agencies offered similar comments mixing caution and anxiety.Other figures in the South Korean entertainment industry noted that cancellations of events were not unusual in China. And big K-pop stars like Psy and Rain have reported no disruptions in their schedules in the country.In China, some people in the entertainment industry said companies might be acting pre-emptively to avoid stepping onto what has become a political minefield.It would not be the first time that Korean entertainers have been the victims of regional tensions.South Korean government officials are watching the developments in China closely.\u201dWe are analyzing the situation in various angles over whether this has anything to do with the Thaad deployment, and we will respond accordingly,\u201d said Cho June-hyuck, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry. Thaad is the acronym for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, the United States antimissile system.The anxiety in South Korea highlighted the increasingly awkward position that Seoul often finds itself in between China, its largest trade partner, and the United States, its traditional military ally.Over the decades, South Korea\u2019s export-driven economy has come to depend on trade with China. While South Koreans and their policy makers have welcomed the trade relations as an economic boon, they have also expressed concerns that China might exploit their country\u2019s increasing dependence as political leverage to drive a wedge between Seoul and Washington.China\u2019s Foreign Ministry did not respond to faxed requests for comment on the K-pop cancellations. But it did respond to news last week that the license of a visa agency serving South Korean businesspeople applying for multi-entry visas to China had been revoked.In a faxed statement, the ministry wrote that the visa policy had not changed.\u201cChina attaches great importance to facilitating the personnel exchanges between China and South Korea, and will continue to provide convenience for South Korean nationals visiting China,\u201d it said.The Chinese state news media has stepped up its criticism of South Korea in the last week, publishing a number of commentaries attacking the plans to deploy Thaad.South Korea insists that the Thaad deployment, in Seongju in southern South Korea, was intended to protect South Korea and American forces in the region from North Korea\u2019s growing missile threats.But China says the deployment is part of Washington\u2019s plan to bring South Korea into a missile-defense system aimed at undermining Chinese and Russian security.Some Chinese media outlets have even said a government ban on South Korean entertainers would enjoy widespread support in China.\u201cEven without official government orders, those embattled South Korean television stations will drown in the spit of online commentators,\u201d the editorial added.Also last week, the American footwear company K-Swiss became the object of criticism for a video advertisement that showed the South Korean actor Park Bo-gum beating a person named \u201cGreat Wall of China\u201d in the board game Go.After taking the video down, the company said on the microblogging service Weibo, \u201cWith regard to matters relating to a recent K-Swiss video, top managers at K-Swiss China are taking urgent steps to review and address the matter.\u201d\u201cThis is pure provocation,\u201d one online user wrote, responding to the statement. \u201cFrom now on, I will admire only stars respecting China.\u201d\u201cGet out of China and go eat your kimchi,\u201d wrote another.Amy Qin reported from Beijing, and Choe Sang-Hun from Seoul, South Korea.

{"Headline": "Trillions in Murky Investments Could Rock China\u2019s Economy", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 The deal could be hard to resist.There is just one catch: Investors know surprisingly little about what they are buying.The offering is just one of a spate of barely regulated, highly opaque investments that are posing a growing threat to the Chinese financial system. As the country\u2019s economy slows, experts increasingly worry that many of the investment funds could fail \u2014 and the government may not know how to handle the shock to its financial system.Over the last five years, Chinese investors have plowed at least $2.8 trillion into buying such funds from banks alone. After quintupling since 2011, these investments, known as wealth management products, now total an amount roughly equal to more than one-third of the country\u2019s annual economic output. Their growth has increased as China\u2019s economy has slowed.That is just the funds distributed by banks. Reliable data on wealth management products sold by other types of firms, like State Gold Treasure, is hard to come by.The problem for China is that a big chunk of the money is going into troubled industries like construction and real estate. Further slowdowns in those areas could result in major blowups.Banks also increasingly use the funds to raise money, instead of more stable deposits. The extra investment cash allows banks to make loans at a much faster clip than their deposits alone would allow. But if investors suddenly demanded their money back, banks could be in a financial bind.The Chinese government so far has stepped in to stop big meltdowns of wealth management products, to avert ripple effects and forestall investor anger. But not all investors have been spared.Li Wenyuan, a doctor in Beijing, says she invested almost $140,000 last year in a wealth management product linked to a steel company. After the company ran into difficulty, she was repaid less than $2,000. She had planned to use the entire original amount to send her son to a high school in Canada, where the air is cleaner and he would have a chance to improve his English.\u201cIt\u2019s quite a big loss for my family,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are still able to provide for ourselves. Still, it\u2019s a lot of money and I doubt I will ever get it back. I am worried.\u201dWealth management products are part of a huge but shadowy system of unregulated investments and underground banks that many Chinese people depend on for the loans that keep their businesses humming. Increasingly, the debate inside and outside China is focusing on what will happen if that system falls apart \u2014 and how quickly the government might be able to respond.China\u2019s wealth management products are neither stocks nor bonds nor mutual funds. A typical wealth management product offers a fixed rate of return over a set period. Many Chinese investors treat them like bank savings deposits because many are sold by state-controlled banks that give the funds the appearance of government backing.Among the biggest issuers of wealth management products are hundreds of banks and other financial institutions in poor, inland provinces. These banks are under intense pressure from provincial political bosses to keep lending and help sustain big employers like state-owned enterprises, at a time when the entire country\u2019s economy is slowing.To raise money for large-scale lending, banks have ramped up issuance. They sold 187,000 separate wealth management products by the end of last year, up 56 percent from a year earlier, according to official statistics.Technology has made it easier for firms other than banks, like State Gold Treasure, to sell the products online and through smartphone apps. \u201cIn the past, you\u2019d need to go to the bank to open an account or open an account at a certain fund company,\u201d said He Zhirui, a finance company worker in Beijing who also invests in wealth management products. \u201cNow, with the apps, you can simply upload your personal ID and purchase wealth management products right away online.\u201dChina\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.But the fund does not say who is guaranteeing the funds. The company declined interview requests and to make officials available for comment during a visit to its offices.The proliferation of wealth management products has drawn concern from regulators. In May, China\u2019s banking commission warned that the business was plagued with problems, including unauthorized products.Regulators are also considering new oversight rules. The goal, the commission said in response to questions, was to \u201cfacilitate a standards-based, healthy and sustainable development\u201d and to \u201cprevent risks.\u201dBut smaller banks combined are now almost as large as the four main banks combined. Wealth management products account for up to a third of money raised at many midsize and smaller banks.Mr. Li, the central bank adviser, and other officials and economists say the Chinese government has the resources to cover big losses if wealth management products fail. They also say China\u2019s increasingly tough enforcement of limits on sending money abroad will ensure that enough cash remains in the country in the event of a big failure.But some specialists in Chinese finance say that serious problems could appear faster than expected. They could also lurk in unexpected corners unnoticed by Chinese regulators, much less international investors.Owen Guo contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

Right now there is an overwhelming case for more government borrowing.Let me walk through this case, then address some of the usual objections.And this analysis doesn\u2019t even take into account the potential role of public investment in job creation: Despite a low headline unemployment rate, the U.S. economy is still probably short of full employment, and an investment agenda would also offer valuable insurance against possible future downturns.So why aren\u2019t we borrowing and investing? Here are some of the usual objections, and why they\u2019re wrong.There is, in short, an overwhelming policy case for federal borrowing to pay for public investment. But will the next president be able to act on this case?The good news is that elite discourse seems, finally, to be moving in the right direction. Five years ago the Beltway crowd was fixated on debt and deficits as the great evils. Today, not so much.The bad news is that even if Hillary Clinton wins, she may well face the same kind of scorched-earth Republican opposition President Obama faced from day one. So it matters not just who wins in November, but by how much.

{"Headline": "Zambia Votes Amid Economic Slowdown and Political Violence", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJOHANNESBURG \u2014 For the past decade, Zambia, a copper-rich nation in southern Africa, has been one of the continent\u2019s success stories: a stable democracy that enjoyed rapid economic growth thanks to China\u2019s ravenous demand for its main commodity.But as a slowdown in China decreased demand for copper and as prices collapsed, Zambia\u2019s economy tumbled, contributing to a political campaign season punctuated by killings and widespread violence.Voting on Thursday appeared to go smoothly in the capital, Lusaka, where Election Day is a national holiday. Shops closed and roads were clear of traffic.On Wednesday, Mr. Lungu urged voters to give him a full term.\u201cI have been on probation for one year, six months, and I think I have done very well,\u201d he said at a rally. He added that while he would respect the election results, he would not allow somebody to take power through \u201cviolence or intimidation.\u201dHis rival, Mr. Hichilema, who is seeking the presidency for the fifth time, said that he was better equipped to revive the economy.\u201cWe are business people,\u201d he said. \u201cWe understand the economy; this economy is broken.\u201dThe economy appeared to be on the minds of many voters, including at a polling station in Kamanga, an area of lower- and middle-class residents east of the capital.Mike Banda, 40, a businessman who supports the president, said it was unfair to blame Mr. Lungu for the poor economy.\u201cIt\u2019s a global problem,\u201d he said, raising a clenched fist, the sign of the president\u2019s party.Seeing the fist, a jobless man, Isaac Chikopa, 23, interjected. He said that Mr. Lungu and his party, which took over the presidency five years ago, had mismanaged the economy.\u201cFive years ago, I used to have three meals a day, and now I have one,\u201d said Mr. Chikopa, adding that he was voting for Mr. Hichilema.In a region known for presidents brutally clinging to office for decades, Zambia had smooth elections and transfers of power since 1991, long before multiparty democracies emerged elsewhere on the continent. But a handful of people have been killed and many others injured in recent political violence.\u201cIf anything, it has used it to intimidate the opposition or to fuel violence,\u201d Ms. Musuva said.The violence, Ms. Musuva said, was exacerbated by the closeness of the race and by a worsening economy, in which the state controls even more of Zambia\u2019s resources than during periods of plenty.\u201cIt\u2019s an all-or-nothing or zero-sum game,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause the state is the largest source of employment and Zambia has a very small private sector.\u201dDespite such economic problems, the main presidential contenders campaigned on promises to increase spending on infrastructure, health and education.None of the presidential contenders, Mr. Nshindano said, offered substantial proposals to diversify Zambia\u2019s economy and make it less dependent on a single commodity or market.\u201cWhat we should have heard is hard truths,\u201d he said, \u201cbut unfortunately, in politics, hard truths don\u2019t work.\u201dBallots are expected to be counted in a few days.

So was the chief of security for the opening ceremony as he left Olympic Stadium. A police officer was killed when his vehicle was sprayed with gunfire, and an Olympics bus carrying journalists was attacked by people throwing rocks.Mindful of Rio\u2019s reputation for violent crime, the Brazilians have deployed 85,000 security personnel. This show of force includes 23,000 soldiers patrolling the city, some in military vehicles, along with helicopters and warships looming around the city\u2019s most popular beaches.\u201cThe city has never felt so safe,\u201d said Gilberto Dias, 50, a hot dog vendor who described how plainclothes officers had sprung to action one morning last week after two muggers accosted a tourist in the upscale Copacabana neighborhood. \u201cThey just materialized out of nowhere, which is something I\u2019ve never seen before.\u201dBut even before the Games began, Rio was facing a surge in lawlessness in recent months that had rattled residents and alarmed the authorities.With the economy in turmoil, assaults and robberies on the street jumped by 42 percent in May, with 10,000 robberies that month. And after years of declining homicides, the number of murders increased by more than 7 percent during the first half of the year, with over 1,500 people killed.\u201cThe assault on the American athlete is what happens to us in Rio every day,\u201d said Marcello Brito, 51, an architect, referring to Mr. Lochte.Rio\u2019s finances were so bad before the Games that it had declared a \u201cstate of calamity.\u201d Budgets had been gutted, with police officers and firefighters protesting delays in receiving pay by holding signs at the airport telling visitors, \u201cWelcome to hell.\u201dThe federal government responded with an $850 million bailout package to help the state of Rio de Janeiro stay afloat, pay salaries and keep essential services running during the Olympics.But the crisis in Rio\u2019s finances, which are heavily dependent on global oil prices, remains, and the security lapses threaten to undermine ambitions for a resurgence in the city\u2019s fortunes.Many residents have welcomed the increased security.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see soldiers patrolling the streets, at least where I live,\u201d said Cassius Almada, 39, a high school math teacher who lives in Copacabana. \u201cIt could be a lot worse.\u201dBut those living beyond the necklace of upscale seafront neighborhoods say the increased security has had little effect in communities that have long been troubled by violence.Maria do Ros\u00e1rio Silva Santos, 54, who was visiting Rio from Bras\u00edlia, the nation\u2019s capital, said she had been stunned to see young men \u2014 not police officers \u2014 toting guns casually in Acari, a working-class neighborhood in north Rio, where she was staying during the Games.\u201cIt was shocking to see,\u201d she said. \u201cAs far as I can tell, nothing has changed.\u201dJulita Lemgruber, the director of the Center for Studies on Public Security and Citizenship at Candido Mendes University in Rio, said it was na\u00efve to expect a drastic drop in crime during the Games.\u201cThe government thought a snap of their fingers would bring peace to a city that has lived through so much violence in the past few years,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t do any good to have this show of thousands of extra police unless you tell every Olympic athlete to walk the street with a policeman by his side.\u201d\u201cPolice forces are invading the favelas every day and killing people, which is outrageous,\u201d Ms. Lemgruber said. \u201cHow can anyone hope to bring peace by spreading violence?\u201dHeder Martins de Oliveira, the vice president of Brazil\u2019s National Association of Police Officers, said that the killing of the officer in Rio last week pointed to the risks that security forces faced daily in the city. Referring to the wave of armed assaults during the Games, he said, \u201cThe situation would be even worse, an international disgrace, if dedicated police weren\u2019t doing their job at this time.\u201d\u201cOf course, there\u2019s more attention to these episodes because they\u2019re taking place when the world is looking at Rio,\u201d Mr. Martins de Oliveira said. \u201cBut this is a dilemma that Rio faces on a daily basis.\u201dThe police have also been involved in violent episodes blemishing the Olympics. Over the weekend, an off-duty federal police official opened fire in the direction of a man he was brawling with at Rio Scenarium, a downtown nightclub. It was not clear whether anyone was seriously injured.Amid the surge in lawlessness, many residents have found a measure of solace on social media, where they commiserate about their experiences and document each episode of crime in hopes of spurring the authorities to action.Among dozens of Facebook groups focused on crime is \u201cWhere I was robbed,\u201d a user-generated map containing dots that form a road map of brutalization and despair.\u201cHello, hello, authorities!\u201d one Facebook user, Eliane Cattapan, wrote recently. \u201cWith the arrival of all the tourists, I\u2019m much more afraid of the rise in street crime than terrorism.\u201dPaula Moura and Vinod Sreeharsha contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro, and Tania Franco from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Week of TV Trials in China Signals New Phase in Attack on Rights", "Date": "2016-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Chinese lawyers and rights activists appeared in televised trials throughout this week in what seemed to be a new, more public phase of President Xi Jinping\u2019s campaign to cleanse the country of liberal ideas and activism.Legal experts and supporters of four defendants denounced the hearings, held on consecutive days in Tianjin, a port city near Beijing, as grotesque show trials. All four men were shown meekly renouncing their activist pasts and urging people to guard against sinister forces threatening the Communist Party, before they were convicted and sentenced.But for the government, the trials served a broader political purpose.\u201cThe trials thus serve two purposes: to punish the activists, but also to use them to bolster President Xi\u2019s claims,\u201d she said.Subversion trials are not new in China, but the intense, concerted publicity around these trials signified a shift. Chinese state-managed newspapers, television programs and websites used the trials to offer a daily torrent of damning words against Western influence and liberal political ideas.The legal proceedings and the drumbeat of propaganda appeared better meshed than ever, said Eva Pils, a legal scholar at King\u2019s College London who has long studied human rights lawyers in China. \u201cIt does feel rather like a program that has been rolled out,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a trial process that serves the purpose of projecting the power of the state and casting human rights advocates as enemies.\u201dBut generally, coverage in the Chinese news media of previous subversion trials was relatively muted, Ms. Pils said.That has been changing under Mr. Xi.\u201cIt is a very different approach to handling political trials that we can see now,\u201d Ms. Pils said. \u201cObviously, that\u2019s part of what\u2019s been happening under Xi Jinping, this whole completely anti-liberal turn.\u201dThe legal proceedings this week bore the hallmarks of old-school propaganda, as the defendants, who once vigorously challenged the government to expand human rights, delivered well-rehearsed confessions adopting the preferred lexicon of the Communist Party.They bowed their heads, denounced themselves and their friends as tools of anti-Communists abroad, and thanked the party for rescuing them from deluded liberal democratic ideas.One of them, Zhou Shifeng, took a moment before he was convicted of subversion to thank Mr. Xi. \u201cI never grasped that Western \u2018peaceful evolution\u2019 of China was so serious,\u201d Mr. Zhou said, using the party\u2019s term for a quiet, creeping coup. \u201cMy crimes show that the great numbers of lawyers and citizens need to heed a warning bell.\u201d\u201cWe must see clearly the ugly faces of those hostile foreign forces, and those within the country with ulterior motives,\u201d Mr. Zhai said Wednesday at his trial. \u201cDon\u2019t be hoodwinked by the rhetoric they parade about \u2018democracy,\u2019 \u2018human rights\u2019 and the \u2018public good.\u2019 \u201dTaken together, the prosecutorial claims of antigovernment plotting included virtually every cause that Mr. Xi and his subordinates in the security services have identified as a threat: \u201cdie-hard\u201d rights lawyers, activists adept at igniting online controversy, underground churches that defy government controls, disgruntled workers, separatists from Tibet and Xinjiang, and foreign groups supporting legal advocacy in China.And then there are shadowy forces abroad accused of engineering discontent to overthrow the party.Running beneath the display of legal force, experts said, was an undercurrent of fear.This week\u2019s trials were accompanied by newspaper editorials and several videos amplifying the party\u2019s message that China is the target of conspiratorial subversion, backed by Western capitals or even planned by them. It calls such efforts \u201ccolor revolutions,\u201d a term taken from upheavals in former Soviet states.\u201cThe Western forces represented by America often wield the banner of \u2018democracy, liberty and rule of law\u2019 to create social conflict in targeted countries, with the intention of overthrowing governments,\u201d one documentary said.\u201cThe central government under the leadership of the party is crystal clear about the dangers of \u2018color revolution,\u2019 \u201d it said. But, it added, \u201cWe are extremely confident that China will not become the next Soviet Union.\u201dThe prosecutors dwelled on a meeting that the four men and others had attended at a restaurant in Beijing in February 2015. According to a recording they cited, Mr. Hu told the gathering that their goal was to ignite protests leading to \u201ceven bigger clashes producing bloodshed, causing social turmoil that will give the international community an excuse to become involved.\u201dThe publicity around the trials also showed that Mr. Xi and his colleagues wanted to amplify their message, including abroad. \u201cIt is likely that Beijing also intends this message to be heard by foreign organizations that have worked with, or funded, China\u2019s rights activists,\u201d Mr. Minzner said by email.Relatives of the four defendants were denied access to the trials. The government said that was at the men\u2019s request, but Liu Xiaoyuan, a former colleague of Mr. Zhou\u2019s, the lawyer, said the exclusion of families violated court rules and went further than many previous trials of dissidents had.The rapidly delivered verdicts, Mr. Liu said in an interview, reinforced a sense of choreography about the proceedings. \u201cPreviously, for politically sensitive cases like these, the verdicts would not be reached so quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this week, the verdicts were delivered on the same day as the trial, and the defendants\u2019 lawyers hardly raised any objections.\u201dAdam Wu contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Too Poor to Afford the Internet", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAll summer, kids have been hanging out in front of the Morris Park Library in the Bronx, before opening hours and after closing. They bring their computers to pick up the Wi-Fi signal that is leaking out of the building, because they can\u2019t afford internet access at home. They\u2019re there during the school year, too, even during the winter \u2014 it\u2019s the only way they can complete their online math homework.Last year, the Federal Communications Commission reaffirmed what these students already knew: Access to broadband is necessary to be a productive member of society. In June, a federal appeals court upheld the commission\u2019s authority to regulate the internet as a public utility.The court\u2019s decision is a partial victory. While the ruling ensures that the information superhighway can be maintained for the public interest, it doesn\u2019t help anyone who simply can\u2019t afford to have access to it. As many as one in five Americans remains in the digital dark. To start to tackle that problem, the F.C.C. has recently expanded its Lifeline program to provide subsidies for broadband access..Here in the world\u2019s information capital, New Yorkers are still scrounging for a few bars of web access, dropped like crumbs from a table. With broadband costing on average $55 per month, 25 percent of all households and 50 percent of those making less than $20,000 lack this service at home.People line up, sometimes for hours, to use the library system\u2019s free computers. Go into any library in the nation and you\u2019ll most likely see the same thing. They come to do what so many of us take for granted: apply for government services, study or do research, talk with family or friends, inform themselves as voters, and just participate in our society and culture \u2014 so much of which now takes place online.Our public libraries are charged with providing free access to information, and in recent years we have had to create new ways of doing that. Leaking broadband (frankly, accidentally) onto the branch stoops is not enough.In 2014, working with Mayor Bill de Blasio, and with support from Google and the Knight, Open Society and Robin Hood Foundations, we were able to let our patrons \u201ccheck out\u201d the internet. In all five boroughs \u2014 and also in Maine and Kansas, to see how it might work in more rural settings \u2014 libraries are lending a total of 10,000 cellphone-size Wi-Fi hot-spot devices for up to a year in neighborhoods that are digital deserts. With this access at home, young children and teenagers in our after-school programs and immigrants in our rapidly expanding English classes continue to learn and connect after they exit the library\u2019s doors.Yet we need help from more than libraries. No child can have equal access to education, nor any worker equal access to a job, without access to the internet and the digital training to use it skillfully. Our federal, state and local policies must recognize there can be no full equality without digital equality. We can also require the companies that reach millions of customers via city infrastructure to provide more affordable rates for low-income residents, and to ensure that broadband connections are provided to poor neighborhoods.Another, bolder approach, would be to create Wi-Fi for large geographic areas. Dozens of municipalities, including Philadelphia, Hartford and Minneapolis, have tried to offer Wi-Fi in their entire cities, with mixed success. Under Mayor de Blasio, New York City recently began an innovative program that refashions old public pay phones into Wi-Fi hot spots. Libraries and schools could add to this growing network of free broadband. Perhaps we should project Wi-Fi from every public building, with boosters to create a minimal level of home access as a public utility for all \u2014 and those who can afford a premium service may pay for one.I know there are technological hurdles to providing universal broadband. But the commitment I\u2019m asking for isn\u2019t particularly novel. Early in the last century, the nation\u2019s leaders decided, at no small cost, to bring clean water, then electricity, then phone service to all parts of our country. And from this foundation we built the wealthiest, most productive economy in the world.When New York City was founded by the Dutch, it had two great strengths: a population of varied backgrounds and ideas, and access to information, through its vibrant shipping industry. This is what made us a global city. Today\u2019s technology revolution promises to provide more information, more widely than ever. Yet we have left almost two million New Yorkers in the digital dark.We can fix this. We can realize our city\u2019s full potential in the digital age. And the kids in the Bronx can get their math homework done.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Japan, Seeking to Regain Manufacturing Might, Bets on Aerospace", "Date": "2016-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGIFU, Japan \u2014 Kato Manufacturing, based in the blue-collar enclave of Gifu Prefecture, in central Japan, is a microcosm of the country\u2019s industrial evolution.The family-run metal shop, which was started 128 years ago, originally made simple farming tools for what was then a largely agrarian society. When Japan morphed into a manufacturing giant, churning out automobiles and electronics for the world, Kato supplied the metallic equivalent of skeletons: sculpted frames and housings that gave products their shape.Now, as Japan aggressively tries to regain some of its manufacturing might in the face of competition from lower-cost countries like China, Kato is producing parts for airplanes. The company recently installed new metalworking machinery and hired a half-dozen workers to accommodate orders from domestic aircraft makers.\u201cAirplanes, rockets \u2014 they\u2019re a symbol for manufacturing,\u201d said Keiji Kato, the company\u2019s president and the fourth generation of the family\u2019s leadership at the firm.Kato Manufacturing is a small piece of Japan\u2019s vast bet on aerospace, a multibillion-dollar government effort to replace lost manufacturing jobs and to lift up the country\u2019s industrial heartland, centered in Gifu and neighboring prefectures. Sony and Panasonic have closed consumer electronics factories here in the last decade. While the car industry has been more resilient, officials worry that the region\u2019s industrial base is becoming dangerously narrow.Developing aerospace is more than just a bid for economic growth. The most public symbol of this effort, the Mitsubishi Regional Jet, is being billed as an instrument of national pride and industrial renewal, a chance for Japan Inc. to restore some of its former glory. At a short test flight of the aircraft from an airport in Nagoya, Japan\u2019s economy minister declared \u201cthe start of a new era for Japan\u2019s aviation industry.\u201dBut breaking into the aerospace sector will be difficult. The country last produced a passenger aircraft more than 40 years ago, at the end of the propeller era. And Japan has never produced a civilian jet plane, although it has assembled some military models.The industry, which requires huge start-up costs, is dominated by a handful of established behemoths. Embraer of Brazil and Bombardier of Canada have long operated as a virtual duopoly in the midsize passenger jet market that Mitsubishi is targeting. Chinese and Russian manufacturers also recently tried to grab a share of the business, with mixed results.Taxpayer funds are on the line. The Japanese government is underwriting about a third of the development costs for the Mitsubishi jet, which were initially projected at $1.5 billion but are likely to rise after repeated delays.\u201cIt\u2019s a miracle this project came about at all in this day and age,\u201d said Yasuo Unakami, an analyst at the Japan Finance Corporation, a government-backed research and investment group. \u201cIf Japan succeeds at this, it could be a huge new industry. But the short-term hurdles are high.\u201dFor a country proud of its manufacturing heritage, the fact that no modern passenger airplane is marked \u201cmade in Japan\u201d rankles.Japan was banned from making planes after its defeat in World War II. Although the prohibition ended decades ago, efforts to revive the industry stumbled. One project, a propeller plane called the YS-11, built by Mitsubishi and other big names in the 1960s and \u201970s, was a commercial flop.Even so, enthusiasts still celebrate the short-lived plane. When the last ones were retired from service by airlines a few years ago, newspapers and television news programs were full of nostalgic tributes.The Mitsubishi Regional Jet, for which Kato is making parts, is drawing on a similar sentiment. At the unveiling of a prototype in 2014, a film showed workers holding signs with messages like \u201cMade in Japan,\u201d \u201cThis is our M.R.J.\u201d and \u201cM.R.J. renovates Japan.\u201d\u201cThe world is full of products that are made in Japan, but unfortunately there hasn\u2019t been a domestically made passenger plane in about 40 years,\u201d Hideaki Omiya, the chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the plane\u2019s developer, said at the time. \u201cThis is a long-held dream.\u201dThe Mitsubishi jet is the most prominent of several Japanese aircraft projects underway. Honda Aircraft Company, a subsidiary of Honda Motor, is developing a light jet for five or six passengers, but it is being built in North Carolina.Mitsubishi considers its new passenger jet the logical extension of a business that has grown to encompass satellite-carrying rockets and large-scale subcontracting work on Boeing jets. The company says it has an edge in technology, in particular lightweight composite materials. The materials, Mitsubishi says, will make the new jet more fuel efficient than those of its rivals.But making parts and subsystems to order is one thing. Organizing the hugely complex task of assembling a modern jet is another.The delays to the project have added to costs and undercut technological advantages by giving competitors like Embraer time to catch up. Mitsubishi\u2019s first test flight took place last year, three years behind schedule. The first delivery had originally been planned for early 2014, but is now expected in late 2018.Mitsubishi declined to disclose its latest cost estimates for the project, but it said it would cover any overruns without relying on additional support from public funds. \u201cWe will recover our investment costs in the long run,\u201d it said in a statement.Despite the challenges, Mitsubishi is a central piece of the government\u2019s plans to nurture a broader industry and to provide a lift to the sagging economy. Aircraft manufacturing now generates about 1.5 trillion yen, or about $15 billion, in revenue for Japanese businesses, according to the Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies, an industry lobby. That is up by half from five years ago, though it is still just a small fraction of the auto industry\u2019s sales.Japan\u2019s efforts extend along the supply chain. C-Astac, a government organization, helps small-business owners break into aerospace, holding seminars to explain the certification and grant process.Subcontractors like Kato Manufacturing are benefiting from start-up cash and relaxed regulations on things like factory floor space to accommodate new machinery. Mr. Kato said he received a government grant of \u00a515 million to buy new equipment.His new team is a mix of seasoned factory workers and novice recruits. Ryoji Soga, a young-looking 72, retired seven years ago but decided to come back when he heard the company needed experienced hands to produce new kinds of aircraft parts.Mr. Soga said he was glad to have a good-paying industrial job. \u201cIt\u2019s better than waving a flag at a road construction site or cleaning toilets at a supermarket,\u201d he said.A picture caption on Tuesday with an article about Japan\u2019s vast bet on aerospace misidentified the type of plane shown. It is a propeller plane, not a jet plane.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Millions of Americans Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton Barely Mention: The Poor", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The United States, the wealthiest nation on Earth, also abides the deepest poverty of any developed nation, but you would not know it by listening to Hillary Clinton or Donald J. Trump, the major parties\u2019 presidential nominees.Mrs. Clinton, speaking about her economic plans on Thursday near Detroit, underscored her credentials as an advocate for middle-class families whose fortunes have flagged. She said much less about helping the 47 millions Americans who yearn to reach the middle class.\u201cWe don\u2019t have a full-voiced condemnation of the level or extent of poverty in America today,\u201d said Matthew Desmond, a Harvard professor of sociology. \u201cWe aren\u2019t having in our presidential debate right now a serious conversation about the fact that we are the richest democracy in the world, with the most poverty. It should be at the very top of the agenda.\u201dIt is not as if Washington policy makers have completely forgotten the poor. President Obama and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin have advocated expanding the earned-income tax credit for childless men and tackling a criminal justice system that has saddled minor offenders with lives of economic struggle.And Mrs. Clinton\u2019s policies, although rhetorically geared toward the middle class, would probably have a broader effect. On Thursday, in Warren, Mich., she again promised an economy that works for \u201ceveryone, not just those at the top.\u201d She has called for raising the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour from $7.25 an hour, which would directly benefit many lower-income workers. And her proposals to help the middle class would benefit some lower-income families, too. She has proposed expanding federal subsidies for health care, child care and education, and mandating improved benefits for workers.\u201cYou want more?\u201d Heather Boushey, the executive director of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, asked of those who argue that Mrs. Clinton should embrace an explicit anti-poverty agenda. \u201cThat\u2019s great. That is such an audacious statement. They want everything, and I am with them. But it is also worth noting that Hillary Clinton is running on the most progressive platform any party has put together.\u201dMs. Boushey is an adviser to the Clinton campaign but said she was not speaking for it. The campaign itself did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Trump said Monday that he would spur economic growth by reducing taxes and regulation, and by renegotiating trade agreements to bring manufacturing back to the United States. He also outlined a plan to help some families offset the expense of child care.The Upshot\u2019s presidential forecast, updated daily.Mr. Trump said in July that he favored a $10-an-hour federal minimum wage, but he has made contradictory remarks in other public appearances, the proposal does not appear in campaign materials, and he did not mention it in Detroit.Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump have said that they are focused on creating more and better jobs.\u201cMy primary mission as president will be to create more opportunity and more good jobs with rising wages right here in the United States,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said in accepting the Democratic nomination in Philadelphia last month.Mr. Trump, during a speech in Miami to the National Association of Homebuilders on Thursday, lamented the decline of homeownership since the housing and financial crisis of 2008. But he stopped short of outlining a housing policy.\u201cIt was pretty shocking not to hear that word, housing, uttered on the main stage\u201d at either party\u2019s convention last month, Mr. Desmond said.Kathryn Edin, a professor of public health at Johns Hopkins University, said it was particularly important to focus on the plight of families without regular income. Federal benefits for workers, notably the earned-income tax credit, have steadily expanded in recent decades, improving the lives of those who have jobs.While Donald J. Trump or Hillary Clinton will represent the entire country, the Americans who selected them are a small part of it.Ms. Edin and other advocates also express frustration that both candidates tend to focus on manufacturing, a sector that employs less than 10 percent of the work force.The candidates have spent less time talking about the service jobs performed by the vast majority of low-wage workers. There were 64,000 steelworkers last year \u2014 and 820,000 home health aides.\u201cMuch of what I hear is an argument over who is going to help the working class that\u2019s been hurt by globalization, more than the retail or restaurant worker who is stuck at a low wage,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group. \u201cWe have to be mindful of where those displaced manufacturing workers have ended up, which is in the low-end service sector.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s policies, while ostensibly aimed at the middle class, would in fact benefit the rich.Even his call for a greatly expanded tax deduction for child care costs would benefit only households that itemize their taxes, most of them with incomes over $75,000.Mr. Bernstein did add that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s proposals could benefit those workers, even if that was not her focus on the campaign trail.\u201cIt\u2019s not at all unusual for people running for president not to talk about poverty because the poor are not necessarily the swing voters you\u2019re trying to pick off,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I actually think a lot of her proposals would help \u2014 she just doesn\u2019t always connect the dots to poverty and low-income workers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Misguided Embrace of Tax Cuts", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIn a speech in Detroit on Monday, Donald J. Trump put forward a huge tax cut as the centerpiece of his economic program. He compared his plan to Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1981 tax cut, saying his proposal would be \u201cthe biggest tax revolution since the Reagan tax reform, which unleashed years of continued economic growth and job creation.\u201dI know something about the Reagan tax cut. In 1977, while working for Representative Jack Kemp, Republican of New York, I drafted the Kemp-Roth tax bill, which Reagan sent to Congress in early 1981. The law cut statutory tax rates by about 25 percent across the board.It is G.O.P. dogma that the Reagan tax cut set off an economic boom. Every Republican presidential nominee since the 1980s has promised big tax cuts and another economic surge. Tax increases, Republicans believe, are the kiss of death for the economy.While Mr. Trump has been unafraid to differ with Republican doctrine on many issues, such as Iraq and trade, he is embracing party orthodoxy on taxes. But the Reagan tax cut is not the medicine the economy needs.Tax rates were very high when Reagan proposed cutting them \u2014 much higher than today. The high tax rates from the World War II era had been only partly cut by John F. Kennedy, and the top income-tax rate was 70 percent. Inflation was pushing workers into higher tax brackets when they received cost-of-living pay raises.By contrast, the average tax rate on the median family in 2014 was just 5.3 percent, and the marginal rate was 15 percent. Inflation is nonexistent, and no one is being pushed into higher tax brackets by it.In short, taxes were too high in 1981 and needed to be cut \u2014 including for the rich. The tax rates above 50 percent were not bringing in much revenue because wealthy people were likely to invest in tax shelters.But the Reagan tax cut played only a secondary role in the 1980s boom, which wasn\u2019t really much of a boom. Real G.D.P. grew 37.9 percent in the 1970s, compared with 36.1 percent in the 1980s. The economy felt better because inflation came down extraordinarily quickly, far more quickly than economists in 1980 thought was possible. But this was primarily a result of the Federal Reserve\u2019s tight money policy, not taxes.The tax cut deserves credit for softening the blow from the reduction in inflation, which brought on a sharp recession in 1981-82. But what we think of as the Reagan boom was the typical rebound from a sharp recession, just as we had seen after all previous postwar recessions. Much credit for growth in the Reagan years must go to the sharp increase in government purchases for his defense buildup.What many Republicans also forget is that Reagan cared about deficits and supported 11 different tax increases from 1982 to 1988 that collectively took back half of the 1981 tax cut. Although many conservative economists predicted doom from the 1982 tax increase, which equaled 1 percent of G.D.P., the beginning of the boom coincided with its enactment.These economists also predicted catastrophe from the 1993 tax increase enacted under President Bill Clinton and from the expiration of many of President George W. Bush\u2019s tax cuts in 2013. But in each case financial markets and the economy grew sharply afterward. By contrast, the economy tanked during the Bush years despite numerous large tax cuts.The final proof that tax cuts are not the be-all and end-all of growth policy is the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which dropped the top income-tax rate to 28 percent. Conservative doctrine predicted an economic boom, but I don\u2019t remember one, nor can I find one in the data.Those economists who claim to be following Reagan\u2019s policies by supporting Mr. Trump\u2019s large tax-cut proposal are guilty of one-size-fits-all economics. There is far more evidence from the last 35 years showing that tax increases do more to stimulate growth than tax cuts.I wouldn\u2019t suggest that tax increases are always the answer. Whether taxes should be raised or cut can be determined only by analysis, not by dogma.Bruce Bartlett held senior policy roles in the Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations.

Nations need a plan to ease the burden of communities that have responded generously and to come up with better mechanisms to care for the most vulnerable refugees first.The declaration drafted for the meeting sets the right goals but never moves beyond generalities like: \u201cWe commit to a more equitable sharing of the burden and responsibility for hosting and supporting the world\u2019s refugees, while taking account of existing contributions and the differing capacities and resources among states.\u201dCurrently, a driving force of mass migration is conflict, which continues to uproot Syrians, Iraqis, Afghans and Yemenis. In coming decades, other problems are expected to compel more people to leave their homes \u2014 like global warming, which is destroying livelihoods; entrenched corruption, which deepens poverty; and autocratic governments, which stifle personal freedoms.Addressing those problems will take generations. But the people in limbo today need shelter immediately. An effort to secure specific commitments to resettle 10 percent of refugees in the lead-up to the summit meeting foundered because Russia and Western European nations balked. The United States, meanwhile, rejected a proposal to ban the detention of unaccompanied minors who are found crossing borders without authorization.To a large extent, the inability to adopt specific, binding solutions is a result of the rampant xenophobia against migrants and refugees \u2014 particularly Muslims \u2014 which has made resettling large numbers of foreigners a political liability in much of the world. That has shamefully been a dominant theme in the American presidential election, as the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, has irresponsibly portrayed Muslims as inherently dangerous and the country\u2019s Southern border as a lawless frontier.There is no easy way to overcome the hysteria, or appease the genuine concerns, about absorbing large groups of foreigners. One way to start, though, is to point to the many instances throughout history in which refugees and migrants have had a positive impact on societies and economies. Leaders in countries that have declining birthrates and rapidly aging populations should look at today\u2019s crisis as an opportunity to help others and, in doing so, help themselves.Advertisement"}

TrumanWhat\u2019s ahead for the American economy?That question is dividing experts, given that the economy has advanced at a slow pace since last winter even as the job market has recorded impressive gains.Well, we have some one-handed economists.On the one hand, Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, sees growth picking up smartly in the third and fourth quarter, powered by a still-strong consumer and fading headwinds for the business sector. Indeed, he believes the Federal Reserve might well raise interest rates when policy makers meet next month.On the other hand, Stephanie Pomboy, founder of MacroMavens, an independent economics consulting firm, thinks the optimists on Wall Street are in for another round of disappointment, with the economy once again failing to deliver a much-promised, but so far elusive, acceleration.With the Labor Department scheduled to release the latest monthly jobs report on Friday, we talked with them last week about why they see things so differently. Why, fundamentally, has growth been so slow lately?So what do you see for the second half of 2016?When do you expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates? Should it even be considering a rate increase?Given your split in views, and the broader questions about growth, what does that mean for the stock market?Longer term, what is your view? Is the economy condemned to slow growth in the years, even decades ahead?Since policy makers can\u2019t abide that slow growth, the onus will shift to the fiscal side and political leadership. Reducing the corporate tax rate, reducing the regulatory burden on companies and changing the tax code to incentivize corporations to hire and expand, rather than pay dividends and buy back stock, would certainly help growth in the long term.That said, there\u2019s a case to be made that more investment in education, more emphasis on retraining and retooling American workers, and more infrastructure spending would help.

She has also proposed an \u201cexit tax\u201d on corporations that move jobs overseas, and wants to limit tax deductions, impose a 4 percent tax surcharge for income over $5 million, and close corporate tax loopholes to help pay for her costly domestic agenda.\u201cI know that too many families right here in Ohio are feeling too much financial stress, worrying about how they\u2019re going to make ends meet,\u201d she said.Get the latest national and state polls on the presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.Mrs. Clinton, who is sometimes mocked for the attention she pays to granular policy details, has taken particular aim at Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal to cut taxes on what are known as pass-through entities: businesses that do not pay corporate income taxes, but whose owners are taxed on individual profits.Calling this provision \u201cthe Trump loophole,\u201d Mrs. Clinton asserted on Wednesday that it would allow Mr. Trump and business owners like him to pay less than half the current tax rate on income from their own companies.Even some Republicans who support Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to slash the tax rate on corporate profits to 15 percent, from the current 35 percent, have criticized the pass-through provision.\u201cWhile reducing corporate income rates is generally good, the pass-through exemption is a bad policy,\u201d said Kyle E. Pomerleau, the director of federal projects at the Tax Foundation, a conservative think tank. He explained that the provision would \u201ccreate a lot of behavioral incentives\u201d for people to restructure how they earn income \u201cin order to get a more favorable rate.\u201dPolling suggests that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s focus on tax issues could resonate with voters, because most Americans agree with the thrust of her ideas.While the weeds of tax policy can be a difficult sell to voters, the broader issue of income inequality has motivated voters this election year.\u201cThe tax system is the poster child for all of that,\u201d said Frank Clemente, the executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness, an advocacy organization. \u201cIt\u2019s through this lens that people really see the system as corrupt and benefiting rich people.\u201dTo that end, Mrs. Clinton tried to sprinkle personal stories around her policy details. \u201cI am proud to be the granddaughter of a factory worker and the daughter of a small-business man and standing here before you,\u201d she said, while portraying her rival as part of the top 1 percent in terms of wealth.She said Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to eliminate the estate tax would save his family an estimated $4 billion, which, by Mrs. Clinton\u2019s calculations, would pay for publicly funded prekindergarten classes for 890,000 4-year-olds and provide a year\u2019s worth of health care for 360,000 veterans.\u201cDonald Trump doesn\u2019t need a tax cut,\u201d she said. She waited for the crowd to quiet down, and then Mrs. Clinton, whose tax returns show that she and former President Bill Clinton earned an adjusted gross income of $10.6 million in 2015, added, \u201cI don\u2019t need a tax cut.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Give Rural America Broadband? Look to the Early 1900s", "Date": "2016-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byZena JournalZENA, Okla. \u2014 From the sofa in his living room, Clinton Creason can see the electric pole outside that his father staked 70 years ago to bring power to this remote area of hilly cattle pastures.Electricity came late here but transformed life on the farm. It provided bright light to study by and freed families from the tedium of washing clothes by hand and cutting wood for the cook stove.\u201cThe cooperative is doing it again, but now the light bulb is the internet,\u201d said Mr. Creason, 82.Mr. Creason\u2019s experience with the electric co-op puts him at the leading edge of a trend unfolding in hard-to-reach rural spots nationwide. For years, such communities have largely been left out of the digital revolution because they had only intermittent internet access, often through a patchwork of satellite, dial-up or wireless service. Telecom and cable companies shunned the areas because it was too expensive to bring equipment and service over long distances to so few people.\u201cThis is the new New Deal,\u201d said Sheila Allgood, a manager of Bolt, the broadband subsidiary of the Northeast Oklahoma Electric Cooperative, referring to government efforts under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt that brought electricity and other infrastructure to rural America in the 1930s. \u201cNow we\u2019re doing what cable and telecom companies don\u2019t want to do, just like we did for electricity when the big private power companies didn\u2019t want to come here either.\u201dBut private power companies said that it was too expensive to electrify rural areas and that even if they did, there was little profit to be made. So President Roosevelt established the Rural Electrification Administration in 1936, a centerpiece of the New Deal, which led to the creation of thousands of small electric cooperatives using federal funds. The co-ops are typically customer-owned and run like regular businesses, with annual dividends returned to members.\u201cWe can see that we are on the cusp of the kind of opportunity brought by electricity, railroads and the telegraph,\u201d Tom Wheeler, chairman of the F.C.C., said in an interview. \u201cBut we have to do something about the availability of broadband in rural areas, where there is a digital divide.\u201dThe Northeast Oklahoma Electric Cooperative is typical of the electric co-ops now bringing broadband to places like this swath of northern Oklahoma. Known as the Grand Lake o\u2019 the Cherokees, the rural region was transformed by the New Deal, which funded the nearby Grand River dam. Soon after, residents created the electric cooperative and the economy took on new life.In 2013, the Northeast Oklahoma Electric Cooperative created its broadband subsidiary, Bolt, after local businesses and younger residents complained there was no future for them without modern infrastructure like high-speed internet. A year later, the co-op said it would provide fiber-based internet with speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second; the service began last year.To provide broadband, Bolt has relied heavily on Northeast Oklahoma Electric Cooperative\u2019s roots as a power supplier. Miles of the co-op\u2019s utility poles now carry fiber cables, and Bolt\u2019s data center is powered by the co-op\u2019s electric substation. The electric and broadband cooperatives share customer service staff, repairmen and billing systems.Bolt\u2019s head of engineering, Shane Burgess, who spent years on the electric side, has found himself negotiating with the same property owners, government officials and contractors over easements and rights of way for fiber optic cable that he did for electricity wiring.\u201cThe technology is a little different but how we get broadband to homes is actually very similar to electric,\u201d he said.Since broadband service has started, signs of economic vitality have appeared in the region.\u201cThere is no way you can run a sophisticated business and back up the data we produce without these broadband speeds,\u201d said Mike Tackett, Ferra\u2019s plant manager in Grove.In Zena, Mr. Creason\u2019s granddaughter recently created a website for her wrecking company and his son ordered a tractor part online, saving himself a daylong trip to the nearest repair shop. His daughter also plans to retire and start an online educational service.\u201cThey are as excited as we were when we first opened the refrigerator door and felt the cool air on our faces,\u201d Mr. Creason said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Under Pressure, Big Banks Vie for Instant Payment Market", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn this digital age when almost anything can be had in an instant, the movement of money can seem glaringly slow.Most people paying a housekeeper or collecting money for an office pool still use cash or a check, which can take days to go through \u2014 a relative eternity that banking regulators worry is impeding commerce and economic growth.The slowness has led many Americans to new mobile services, like PayPal\u2019s Venmo or Square Cash, which make it possible to pay a friend instantly with just a phone.Now, the banks are catching up. On Monday, Wells Fargo joined JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and US Bank in allowing customers to send money in seconds to one another\u2019s bank accounts using just a phone number or email address. Customers of the biggest banks can now use their mobile phones, say, to send money instantly to a child in college who needs cash.\u201cWe pay attention to what customers are asking for, and we are doing all the things we need to stay competitive,\u2019\u2019 said Brett Pitts, who leads digital initiatives at Wells Fargo.The stakes are high: Banks are under broad pressure both from the Federal Reserve, which has a \u201cfaster payments committee\u201d aimed at requiring immediate improvements, and from tech companies like PayPal and Apple, whose Apple Pay service was a bright spot in its recent earnings report.All these companies, and Visa and MasterCard, are competing to build and control the payment network of the future.Banks are promoting their new services as cool and convenient: One Chase advertisement shows the basketball star Stephen Curry dribbling a basketball while making an instant payment on his phone.American bank executives fear that they could lose ground to plucky payment companies like Venmo, a popular choice among millennials who want to pay each other \u2014 and send emoji-filled messages to their friends.The banks worry that if they do not respond with their own instant payment offerings, they will be relegated to performing less-profitable back-office functions for hip new payment companies, which make their money primarily by charging small fees to customers who pay by credit card rather than directly from a bank account.The person-to-person payment market is valuable because it allows financial companies to gain the first point of contact with a consumer and then try to sell them other products like loans.Analysts predict that eventually the new payments network could be extended to connect consumers with merchants, providing a potentially lucrative source of fees for banks.\u201cIt\u2019s like owning a toll road: You are going to get paid by everybody that uses it,\u201d said Gareth Lodge, a payments analyst at Celent, a financial consulting firm.Mastercard and Visa, which have a tight grip on payments made with credit and debit cards, are also trying to gain a foothold in these new networks.Late last month, Mastercard acquired a majority stake in VocaLink, the company that operates a mobile and internet payment network in the United Kingdom and is helping to develop an even broader system in the United States. Also, Visa recently announced a broad partnership with PayPal that will make both of their offerings more instantaneous.Instant person-to-person payment is something that people in many other countries have been able to do for years, and the absence of the service in the United States has been a marker of the relative backwardness of American banks.The banks began developing the system being introduced this year in 2011, when Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo created a network called clearXchange. That system has already allowed bank customers to send each other money using just an email address or cellphone number, but transactions were not instant until this year.In addition to payments technology that the nation\u2019s largest banks are rolling out this summer, banks that belong to an industry group called the Clearing House are developing a broader network that will allow businesses and even governments to make large instant payments.A fast and efficient payment network also has implications for the economy. Federal officials and analysts say the current lag time between when a payment is sent and when the money is cleared to spend can hinder businesses from balancing their books and managing their supplies. The lag also puts the United States at a disadvantage compared with, say, Europe, where banks are far ahead in making payments instantaneous.The banks now face a challenge to make their real-time technology easy enough to lure customers away from start-ups like Venmo.With Venmo, a user can send money to anyone simply by tapping into the app and entering a phone number or email address. By contrast, customers of JPMorgan Chase, for example, must log into their Chase app using their password, then navigate through a series of somewhat clunky tabs to initiate a transaction with QuickPay. The banks also lack the social networking capabilities that have helped make Venmo a hit.Talie Baker, a payments analyst at the Aite Group, a banking consultancy, said that even her friends who have Chase\u2019s service often do not think it is worth using. \u201cI can\u2019t get anybody to accept a Chase QuickPay payment from me,\u201d she said. \u201cBanks are probably going to start losing market share if they don\u2019t make their applications as easy to use as Venmo is.\u201dChase and the other banks say the additional steps they ask of customers provide more security. The banks also say they are already handling significantly more personal payments than Venmo and other competitors like Square Cash.Chase said that last year it processed about $20 billion in so-called peer-to-peer payments, while Venmo handled about $10 billion. PayPal as a whole made about $40 billion in such payments, the company said.The banks should have a significant advantage over technology companies, given the sheer number of customers they already have, payment industry analysts say.PayPal and the banks say the most immediate opportunity is not taking business from one another, but cannibalizing the enormous number of payments that are still made by cash and check, which represent more than three-quarters of all peer-to-peer transactions.Bill Ready, who oversees Venmo at PayPal, said he was happy that American banks were finally catching up with the progress that has been made in most other developed countries.\u201cThe rest of the world has already been here a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cTo see an industry move is a great thing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He began his government career after building a successful construction business, winning New Mexico\u2019s governorship as a limited-government Republican in 1994. Over two terms he cut state spending, vetoed hundreds of bills and took pride in having \u201cnever raised a penny of tax.\u201dThat perspective remains at the center of his agenda. Mr. Johnson wants to scrap the Dodd-Frank law regulating Wall Street. He insists government can only equalize opportunity, not incomes.\u201cNothing is free,\u201d Mr. Johnson said, mocking Democratic rhetoric. \u201cWas there anything that Hillary didn\u2019t promise in her acceptance speech the other night, to anybody?\u201dMr. Johnson turned away from Republicans for different reasons. He rejected the party\u2019s prescriptive social conservatism, embracing individual choice across issues including abortion, gay marriage and marijuana use (which he wants to legalize).Hailing from a state where Hispanics represent nearly half the population, Mr. Johnson also rejects the propensity of the Republican Party\u2019s Trump-era base to blame immigrants for cultural and economic problems.\u201cThirty percent of Republicans believe the scourge of the earth is Mexican immigration,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the reason for why I don\u2019t have a job? Well, make Mexican immigration the scapegoat for that.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re not taking jobs that U.S. citizens want,\u201d Mr. Johnson argued. \u201cThey are contributing to the economy.\u201dHe also distinguishes himself from most contemporary Republicans by accepting the reality of what he calls \u201cman-caused\u201d climate change. As a solution, he wants to explore taxing carbon \u2014 not for the revenue, but to provide a financial inventive to reduce emissions.\u201cThat may have the result of being self-regulating,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cThe market will take care of it.\u201dNo Libertarian candidate has drawn more than 1 percent of the vote; Mr. Johnson fell just short of that level as the party\u2019s 2012 nominee. Hoping to do better, he offers practical amendments to Libertarian philosophy, opposing the platform\u2019s call to phase out Social Security and backing cost-saving changes instead.His near-term goal is crossing the 15 percent level in the polls. Without reaching the vast debate audience, Mr. Johnson concedes, he and his running mate, William Weld, have \u201cno chance\u201d to win.Yet even if Mrs. Clinton holds her lead and wins the White House, Mr. Johnson envisions a decisive fracture of the two-party system.\u201cThis is the demise of the Republican Party,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an opportunity, I think, for the Libertarian Party to become a major party.\u201dIf that happens, Mr. Johnson has only so much of his time to give the party. Unless he\u2019s in the White House next year, he also plans to enter a 3,000-mile bike race.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New York State Aiding Nuclear Plants With Millions in Subsidies", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUtility customers in New York State will pay nearly $500 million a year in subsidies aimed at keeping some upstate nuclear power plants operating, regulators in Albany decided on Monday.The subsidies were included in an order from the Public Service Commission to establish new rules on how power consumed in the state is generated. The policy, championed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, calls for half of the state\u2019s electricity to come from renewable sources, such as solar or wind, by 2030.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s ambition to have New York seen as a national leader in reducing pollution from power generation has been complicated by the declining fortunes of the operators of nuclear plants. A long slump in the price of natural gas, a fuel for other generators, has hurt the profits of many nuclear plants, prompting plans to shut down some in New York.Without those reactors, the state\u2019s distributors of electricity would have to obtain more power from power plants fueled by gas and coal, which emit more carbon and would detract from the governor\u2019s clean-energy goals, said Audrey Zibelman, the chairwoman of the commission.None of the subsidies will go to the Indian Point nuclear plant in Buchanan in Westchester County, Ms. Zibelman said. That plant, she said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t have economic need\u201d because electricity prices are much higher downstate.Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has pressed federal regulators to shut down Indian Point, arguing that it is unsafe to operate nuclear reactors in a densely populated area so close to New York City. But Entergy, which operates Indian Point, has opposed those efforts.Although keeping the upstate plants running will produce more economic benefits in their local communities than in the New York City metropolitan area, Ms. Zibelman said, \u201cthe environmental benefits we\u2019re looking to achieve are felt everywhere.\u201dMr. Cuomo praised the commission\u2019s action, saying in a statement, \u201cThis Clean Energy Standard shows you can generate the power necessary for supporting the modern economy while combating climate change.\u201dThe commission said that starting in 2017, the subsidies would cost utility ratepayers in the state $962 million over two years. The overall cost of the clean energy program to utility customers would be less than $2 a month, it said.Ms. Zibelman said state officials had calculated the social and economic benefits of the program, including reduction of carbon emissions, lower prices for electricity and jobs in the power-generation industry, to be much greater than the cost.But some environmental groups, including the Alliance for a Green Economy in Syracuse, had opposed the subsidies, calling them possibly \u201cthe largest corporate bailout or subsidy\u201d in state history.Jessica Azulay, program director for the group, said it supported the governor\u2019s push to mandate the purchase of renewable energy by utilities but thought subsidies that could amount to several billion dollars over 12 years were a big mistake.\u201cThey\u2019re dangerous, they\u2019re aging, they\u2019re unprofitable and they should close,\u201d Ms. Azulay said of the nuclear plants.Exelon, which would collect the bulk of the subsidies, applauded the order. The company has pledged to invest about $200 million in its upstate plants next spring if the program is approved.Advertisement"}

It is, instead, about Republicans \u2014 probably a minority within the party, but a substantial one \u2014 who aren\u2019t like that. These are people who aren\u2019t racists, respect patriots even if they\u2019re Muslim, believe that America should honor its international commitments, and in general sound like normal members of a normal political party.Yet the great majority of these not-crazy Republicans are still supporting Mr. Trump for president. And we have a right to ask why.True, a Clinton victory would mean a continuation of the center-left governance we\u2019ve had under Barack Obama, which would be a big disappointment for those who want a turn to the right. And many people have convinced themselves that ideology aside, Mrs. Clinton would be a bad president. Obviously I disagree on the ideology, and while we won\u2019t know about a Clinton presidency until or unless it happens, I find much to admire in the real Hillary, who is nothing like the caricature. But never mind: even if you\u2019re a conservative who really dislikes the Democratic candidate, how can you justify choosing Donald Trump?Put it this way: Is there any reason to believe that a Clinton victory would lead to irretrievable disaster? Because that\u2019s the question you should be asking yourself.Most important of all is the question of democracy at home.I know, conservatives like to complain that Mr. Obama has overstepped his authority by, say, using administrative discretion to delay some provisions of the Affordable Care Act. But let\u2019s be serious: no non-crazy person, even on the right, thinks that this president is acting like a dictator, or that the woman he wants to succeed him would threaten basic liberty. On the other side, anyone watching her opponent has to be very, very worried about his authoritarian streak.The bottom line is that even if you don\u2019t like Mrs. Clinton or what she stands for, it\u2019s hard to see how you could view her possible victory with horror. And it\u2019s hard to see how you could view Mr. Trump\u2019s possible victory any other way.How, then, can rational Republicans justify supporting Mr. Trump, or even remaining neutral, which is in effect giving him half a vote?For rank-and-file Republicans, it\u2019s presumably about feelings. Having spent so many years denouncing Democrats in general and Mrs. Clinton in particular, they have a hard time admitting that someone else could be much, much worse. But democracy isn\u2019t about making a statement, it\u2019s about exercising responsibility. And indulging your feelings at a time like this amounts to dereliction of your duty as a citizen.And whatever one may say about ordinary voters, the real sinners here are Republican leaders \u2014 people like Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell \u2014 who are actively supporting a candidate they know poses a danger to the nation.It\u2019s not hard to see why they\u2019re doing this. Opposing their party\u2019s nominee, no matter how awful he is, would probably end up being a career killer.But there are times when you\u2019re supposed to put such considerations aside. The willingness of some people who know better to support Donald Trump is understandable; it\u2019s also despicable.Advertisement"}

Traditionally a leader of the Arab world, politically and culturally, and home to a quarter of its population, Egypt has become inward-looking and politically marginalized in a way not seen for generations.\u201cIn the past, Nasser was deciding war or peace.

Saudi Arabia and Iran, fierce regional and sectarian rivals, have rushed to fill the void, launching into a potentially dangerous competition for regional dominance.For Egypt, it is a sharp reversal, with no immediate prospects of reclaiming the country\u2019s former status.Since it made peace with Israel in 1979, Egypt has served as the fulcrum of American influence in the Arab world. The Egyptian and American militaries have cooperated closely for decades, and Egypt went to war against Saddam Hussein alongside United States forces in 1991. Cairo long served as an important mediator between Israel and the Palestinians (and among Palestinian factions), though it began to abdicate that role by backing Israel against Hamas in 2014.But Egypt\u2019s withdrawal from regional matters has diminished its value to the United States, which has provided it with over $76 billion in foreign aid since 1948.\u201cEgypt is primarily seen in Washington as a problem and not as a source of solutions,\u201d said Issandr El Amrani, the North Africa project director for the International Crisis Group. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the military relationship and the Pentagon\u2019s preference for having things like fast access through the Suez Canal, it\u2019s clear there are elements of the Obama administration that don\u2019t care much for Sisi and his regime and its domestic pattern of repression and human rights abuses.\u201dEgypt\u2019s influence was long a product of both its military and cultural might. It was a beacon of Arab unity after the tide of European colonialism ebbed in the 20th century, helping build up its neighbors and founding the Arab League, a pioneering effort at regional cooperation that today is seldom effective. Its writers, artists and filmmakers became iconic in the region. Its judges and clerics decided important matters of Islamic law.Amr Moussa, a former foreign minister and Arab League chief who ran for president in 2012, said he doubted there would be \u201cany more foreign adventures,\u201d given the \u201cmajor problems we are facing.\u201dThat has to change, he added. \u201cThe role of Egypt is a must,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a necessity in order to build a balance with Iran and with Turkey.\u201d But the only way to do that, he said, \u201cis the reform of Egypt itself and rebuilding its soft power.\u201dBefore it can rebuild, though, Egypt will have to address a long list of problems. It is at war with a local affiliate of the Islamic State in the Sinai Peninsula. The economy veers from one crisis to the next, hobbled by the collapse of tourism.The number of arriving tourists has dropped by 59.9 percent from last June, according to government figures. More than half the hotels in Sharm el Sheikh, a resort once favored by package tour operators and peacemakers alike, have closed, according to the tourism federation.Egypt has stayed afloat in part thanks to financial support from Persian Gulf nations like Saudi Arabia, which has given Cairo over $25 billion, though that lifeline is now threatened by plunging oil prices. Its alliance with the United States has been strained by disagreements over human rights abuses under Mr. Sisi and the removal of Mr. Morsi.Mr. Fahmy, the former ambassador, said he considered quieting Western concerns over Mr. Morsi\u2019s removal, portraying it as \u201cdefending the revolution,\u201d to be one of the country\u2019s foreign policy successes. Egypt\u2019s relationship with Israel is also strong. But it has done little to respond to the growing list of regional crises.In retrospect, Mr. Amrani added, Egypt may have played an outsize role in past years, as its close ties with the United States \u201cboosted its role beyond its actual weight.\u201dWhile Washington has generally low expectations of Egypt in regional crises, it does think Cairo can be influential in neighboring Libya, where the Sisi administration wants a stable, non-Islamist state to emerge from the chaotic and fragmented political landscape. And it values Egypt\u2019s ability to let American ships and planes pass quickly through the Suez Canal or Egyptian airspace.Mr. Moussa said he believed Egypt\u2019s future might lie in an ever-closer relationship with Saudi Arabia, which, despite growing budgetary pressures, has become the country\u2019s financial benefactor after deciding that \u201cEgypt will have to be saved,\u201d he said.With a leadership vacuum in a chaotic region, Mr. Moussa said, Egypt and Saudi Arabia may be able to keep a non-Arab country like Iran, Turkey or Israel from calling the shots.\u201cI don\u2019t believe that after the \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say the withdrawal of Egypt \u2014 but the role of Egypt was not inherited,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no one single country that has emerged to say, \u2018I can lead this region.\u2019 \u201dNour Youssef contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Official Says", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAlthough some civilians were killed in crossfire, other victims were summarily executed by government troops, apparently targeting Nuers, Mr. Machar\u2019s ethnic group, Mr. Al Hussein said.Heavily armed youths affiliated with the opposition carried out some of the sexual assaults, Mr. Al Hussein said, but others were carried out by government troops: On July 18, troops at a checkpoint sexually assaulted 28 people: 16 women and 12 girls.\u201cAccording to the information we have gathered so far, those most affected were displaced Nuer women and girls, and those responsible seem to have been mostly S.P.L.A.,\u201d he said, referring to the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army, which is loyal to Mr. Kiir.\u201cThe severity of the recent violence, and the very dangerous ethnic undertone, call for urgent action by the Security Council,\u201d he said.They are only the latest victims of a two-and-a-half-year civil war that has already forced around 1.6 million people from their homes and battered the country\u2019s fragile economy, driving up prices of basic commodities, leaving close to five million people without sufficient food, and increasingly exposing the population to disease.An outbreak of cholera that started in early July has affected close to 700 people and killed 21, the World Health Organization has said. The only hospital in Juba coping with the outbreak has been admitting around 35 new patients daily, according to Fadela Chaib, a spokeswoman for the organization.On Thursday, Mr. Al Hussein expressed frustration over the lack of effective action to prevent the kind of atrocities and sexual violence the United Nations described in harrowing detail in a report released in March.The United States and Britain have promised to support plans by the African Union to set up a tribunal to try war crimes committed during the civil war. South Sudan\u2019s government, after agreeing to the initiative in principle, now says it is premature.Mr. Kiir\u2019s government says it has set up a court-martial to punish soldiers who have committed abuses, but it has made those promises before, Mr. Al Hussein noted, and \u201cthe violations continue unabated.\u201dMr. Al Hussein also drew attention to reports that some United Nations peacekeeping troops had failed to assist women and girls who were reportedly raped near their positions. He called for \u201cstrong action\u201d against United Nations military personnel who had neglected their duty to protect civilians.Advertisement"}

A few days later, three Florence police officers with local media in tow arrived at his desk and handed him a fine of about $329, for broadcasting without proper city authorization. \u201cInitially I was a little bit angry,\u201d Mr. Schmidt, a German art historian, said recently over a glass of wine. But he quickly spotted an opportunity, telling them he would pay the fine out of his own pocket. The next day, when he did, journalists were there snapping photos, making him an instant local celebrity.Florentines began approaching Mr. Schmidt on the street to express their support. \u201cSome initially said: \u2018Don\u2019t stop. Finally someone takes these problems seriously,\u2019\u201d Mr. Schmidt said. \u201cThere are other people who actually try to give me money,\u201d he added with a laugh. Once seen as a na\u00efve foreigner, he had earned public respect.The clashing reactions to the loudspeaker experiment point to a fundamental challenge facing Mr. Schmidt. As he fights to manage the crowds, generate more revenue and improve the museum experience \u2014 including its chaotic ticketing system and long lines \u2014 will he continue to marshal popular support and prevail against a morass of bureaucratic restraints, vested interests and political intrigue?\u201cIt\u2019s like playing multiple chess games at the same time,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said.Overseeing the Uffizi, with its world-class holdings and public-sector staffing, is a bit like running the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority at the same time.In what was perceived as a bold move, the Ministry opened directorships, for the first time, to an international search, eventually hiring seven non-Italians. Mr. Schmidt, a scholar of the Medici collection that formed the basis of the Uffizi, had lived in Florence in the past.The reform, advanced by the culture minister, Dario Franceschini, was intended to bring in fresh talent and give these \u201csuper museums\u201d \u2014 including the Capodimonte in Naples, the Pinacoteca di Brera in Milan and the Accademia in Venice \u2014 more control over their budgets, exhibitions and services like cafes and bookshops, to become more self-sustaining at a time when Italy\u2019s economy is stagnating.The change is dramatic for Italy, where the ministry has traditionally run the country\u2019s museums. Since the 1990s, some museum functions, including temporary exhibitions, were outsourced to private companies, creating a confusing overlap of jurisdictions that the reform hopes to untangle.Foreign museum directors are common elsewhere, including at the Met in New York. Appointing a German to the Uffizi is a powerful statement in today\u2019s Europe, where Germany dominates, but Mr. Schmidt plays down that dynamic, noting that in past centuries, the Medici imported a police force from Germany because it was seen as neutral, without local loyalties.The question facing Mr. Schmidt \u2014 can Italy change? \u2014 is the same one facing Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, 41, a former mayor of Florence who is deeply invested in the museum\u2019s fate. He came to power in 2014 promising reform but now sees growing resistance. Creating the autonomous museums is a key part of his legacy. Both are in play, if not in jeopardy.I observed the challenges up close one day in late June, when I attended a staff meeting with Mr. Schmidt, who was sitting in front of Botticelli\u2019s \u201cAnnunciation,\u201d a Renaissance jewel in the collection, displayed temporarily in a room where Dante once gave speeches.In fluent Italian, Mr. Schmidt was discussing how to open to the public one of the museum\u2019s most prized features, a corridor designed by Giorgio Vasari, the 16th-century Italian artist and author. It is now open only to small tours run by private companies that often profit more than the museum does.Most visitors never get to see them, and Mr. Schmidt, who has also been a curator at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, also worries about their condition. In the corridor, he said, \u201cthey get deep-fried in summer and deep-frozen in winter.\u201dBut how to adapt Renaissance architecture for modern-day mass tourism? At the staff meeting, technicians asked questions. Could they do what the Vatican did with the Sistine Chapel, and install a dehumidification system? But where would you put it? And how could you create fire exits? Mr. Schmidt said there was money to study alternatives.Italy has pledged \u20ac58 million, or $65 million, to double the Uffizi\u2019s exhibition space by converting offices into galleries, and to build a new exit for better flow. Mr. Schmidt hopes to move the paintings to a space in the Uffizi with climate control and to display Greek and Roman inscriptions that are less sensitive in the corridor, allowing visitors to cross from one museum to the other.But with change comes resistance. Private tour groups don\u2019t want to lose revenue. Marco Agnoletti, a spokesman for Florence\u2019s mayor, said the director\u2019s plan to open the corridor to the public \u201chas created some perplexity.\u201d In July, a prominent Italian architect who serves on the Uffizi\u2019s advisory committee, Stefano Boeri, said in the press that he didn\u2019t want to remove portraits from the corridor for aesthetic reasons.After Mr. Schmidt announced in March that the hallway would close for renovations this fall, a union organizer filed a complaint, saying that if the corridor wasn\u2019t up to code it should close immediately. The fire department shut it down but later said it could reopen on a limited basis until renovations begin.\u201cI\u2019m fighting for it,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said of his plan to open the corridor to visitors.He points to other battles. He wants the guards to move from room to room, not just sit in one place. This involves potentially fraught negotiations with labor unions. Mr. Schmidt said he had been impressed by the team he inherited, but he and the other new directors want the power to shape their own staffs.And then there\u2019s that pesky ticketing system. Because of a complex resale market of the \u20ac8 ($9) base ticket, private tour groups wind up profiting handsomely from ticket sales. The state recently announced a new public bidding process to hire contractors to handle ticketing and other services.To draw audiences to the Uffizi during nonpeak hours, Mr. Schmidt has begun offering live music inside the museum on Tuesdays, when it\u2019s open late. He also signed an accord with the Maggio Musicale festival to bring opera to Pitti Palace and drew some criticism when the Pitti rented space for an exhibition on Karl Lagerfeld to coincide with the Pitti Uomo men\u2019s fashion show in June.While the Uffizi has to contend with crowd control, other Italian museums have the opposite problem. Near the Uffizi is the Bargello, renowned for its Renaissance sculpture and one of the best collections of Islamic art in Italy. Its new director, Paola d\u2019Agostino, who returned to her native Italy from the Yale University Art Gallery, is trying to set standard opening hours rather than the current ones resulting from state-employed guards who work complicated shifts.The Bargello, which has merged with four other small Florentine museums, also lacks staff, a collections catalog and a database. Ms. D\u2019Agostino inherited a \u20ac2 million, or $2.23 million, deficit. \u201cI\u2019m also the marketing department, development and H.R.,\u201d she said. Still, the biggest success of the reform is \u201cthe fact that people talk about museums, cultural heritage all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cEven the critics.\u201dSome of the new museum directors say the single biggest challenge is not being able to hire and fire.\u201cThe key to sustainability is to have a structure that gives complete autonomy over staff and budget,\u201d said James Bradburne, the new Canadian and British director of the Brera in Milan, one of Italy\u2019s most important collections. On his watch, the museum has reinstalled several galleries and asked writers including Orhan Pamuk to create wall labels. \u201cWe haven\u2019t won any battles or won the war, but we\u2019ve shown that the path we\u2019re following is a legitimate one,\u201d Mr. Bradburne said.To attract visitors to the Capodimonte Museum in Naples, its new director, Sylvain Bellenger, who is French and came from the Art Institute of Chicago, set up a shuttle bus to take people from downtown Naples up the hill to the museum, which is in a park that has a stunning view of the Bay of Naples.But old political habits die hard. There aren\u2019t enough guards to keep all the rooms open because their contract grants them many days off. \u201cLocal interests, clientelism, the appearance of respect for democracy which is in fact clientelism might be the main obstacles,\u201d Mr. Bellenger said, referring to Italy\u2019s entrenched jobs-for-votes culture.Mr. Franceschini, the culture minister, said he was pleased with how the changes were taking hold. \u201cSuch a profound reform will naturally meet resistance,\u201d he said in an interview in Rome. \u201cIf the changes are real, they will meet resistance. If everyone likes them, they\u2019re false.\u201dHe said that in 2015, attendance to Italy\u2019s state museums was up by five million visitors, to 43 million. The ministry is searching for new directors at nine more newly autonomous museums. For the first time in two decades, it is also holding a state competition to hire 500 more art historians and archaeologists for sites across Italy.Back at the Uffizi, I asked Mr. Schmidt if he thought he had the support he needed from the Culture Ministry to push ahead. A small and slightly knowing smile formed on his face. \u201cThey brought me in to do the dirty work,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019d better not abandon me now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Clinton or Trump Recapture Robust American Growth?", "Date": "2016-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIn the 2012 election, voters credited President Obama with the recovery from a calamitous recession. But they are now right to ask, \u201cIs this all there is?\u201d In 2016, voters expect Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump to provide solutions to the economy\u2019s languid growth.Some of these problems can be tackled with bold presidential policies. But there are limits, and other problems may lie beyond the realm of feasible solutions.Presidential candidates who promise faster growth will have to face up to the labor-force constraint. In the 1970s and 1980s, millions of women entered the labor force. Since the mid-1990s, however, female participation has leveled off, and baby boomers are retiring. This labor-force reversal by itself shaves about one percentage point from the growth that is realistic over the next decade compared with the last quarter of the 20th century.Any economic growth beyond the limited increase in workers will depend on the expansion of output per hour, known as labor productivity. But that, too, has also slowed. From 1995 to 2004, productivity per hour grew at 3.1 percent each year, but at only 1.3 percent since 2004, and an even slower 0.5 percent over the past six years.Why the decline in productivity?This effect of that new technology was another important source of growth. Out went typewriters and calculating machines, replaced by personal computers, spreadsheet and word-processing software, web browsers and e-commerce. Productivity also boomed in retailing, as Walmart and other \u201cbig box\u201d stores revolutionized retail selection, layout and supply chain management.Voter unease reflects more than the impact of wage stagnation. Globalization and automation have hollowed out manufacturing, eliminating millions of middle-income blue-collar jobs. Roughly six million workers who want full-time jobs hold part-time positions that lack employer-paid medical insurance and force them to juggle irregular schedules. An \u201catomization\u201d of the workplace has led to the increased use of temporary and on-call workers like Uber drivers and episodic forms of employment that don\u2019t offer traditional benefits. Medical insurance with high deductibles and co-payments threatens families with unpredictable financial setbacks in case of a medical emergency.Furthermore, over the past generation, defined-benefit retirement plans paying a pension have been replaced by defined-contribution plans. These subject retirement savings to the vagaries of the stock market, and many people in their 40s and 50s have not yet recovered the level of real stock market or home equity wealth they had before the Great Recession. With the decline of marriage, there are fewer two-earner families. Young people are emerging from college with a debt burden that in many cases causes them to live with their parents delaying household formation, marriage and children.Unfortunately for the candidates and the country\u2019s prospects, the depth and breadth of these problems go beyond the reach of policies that might nudge the economy\u2019s overall output growth rate up by a few tenths of a percentage point. The slow pace of growth has also squeezed tax revenues, restricting the scope of potential government programs.Policy changes can help: Imposing higher taxes on the superrich and eliminating tax loopholes and deductions that primarily benefit higher-income taxpayers would make some headway both against rising inequality and flagging tax revenue. Minimum wage increases directly attack inequality, because the wage boost to those who retain their low-income jobs substantially exceeds the extent of any resulting job losses.The tax revenues from a superrich tax surcharge and from loophole-busting tax reform would provide the funds for a huge program of investment following the example of the Interstate Highway System, which is generally regarded as a prime source of robust productivity growth in the 1960s. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s proposals thus far include substantial infrastructure spending, and this is an area, along with tax reform, where she has the potential to gain bipartisan approval.Yet there are limits to individual policies. A better direction is to follow other nations like Canada, Australia and the Nordic countries. In those countries, insecurity is less acute because government institutions are more robust. Americans look abroad and wonder why we cannot enjoy the benefits of single-payer medical care, paid parental leave, lower-cost college education and uniform income-contingent college debt repayment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Air of Graft Around Ex-Argentine Government Arouses Fury", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs prosecutors and judges press ahead with the cases, many Argentines question whether the ruling class can move beyond a culture of graft that has hamstrung the country\u2019s progress. \u201cI\u2019ve given up hope,\u201d said Yolanda Galv\u00e1n, 50, a cashier at a pharmacy here, referring to the country\u2019s history of corruption scandals. \u201cThey all end up being the same.\u201dMs. Galv\u00e1n pointed to public unease regarding President Mauricio Macri, whose offshore business activity \u2014 dating to years before his term began in December \u2014 is being investigated after it was revealed in a leak of the documents known as the Panama Papers. Mr. Macri says he has nothing to hide.Ethical concerns also loom over Mr. Macri\u2019s energy minister, Juan Jos\u00e9 Aranguren, who has more than $1 million of shares in Royal Dutch Shell, the oil company for which he previously worked as an executive. The government says owning the shares is not illegal.But it is the cases implicating the upper echelons of Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s administration that have prompted blistering critiques of Argentina\u2019s shortcomings in tackling graft. Experts say that a brittle institutional framework fosters political corruption, and that a politicized judiciary lets those in office off the hook.In the past, corruption scandals involving the Front for Victory\u2019s former officials were viewed by its supporters as smear campaigns engineered by the news media and sectors of the judiciary hostile to Mrs. Kirchner. But more recently, especially with the arrest of the official in the convent, there appears to be little room for such defenses.The official, Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez, a former public works secretary, was discovered by the police with duffel bags packed with cash, Rolex and Omega watches, and a semiautomatic machine gun in the early hours of June 14 at a convent outside Buenos Aires. He has been indicted on charges of illegal enrichment and is in detention while a judge investigates his case.Argentines from across the political spectrum were quick to condemn Mr. L\u00f3pez, who served as public works secretary for the entire three-term period the Front for Victory was in power.\u201cI believe this is the end of Kirchnerismo as an electoral option,\u201d said Andr\u00e9s Malamud, an Argentine political scientist at the University of Lisbon, using the popularized name for the political philosophy adhered to by followers of Mrs. Kirchner and her predecessor and husband, N\u00e9stor Kirchner, who died in 2010.However, many of those supporters are now starting to doubt her. \u201cThey always defended themselves, but now we\u2019ve realized they were screwing us,\u201d said Jonathan Ramis, 20, a business management student who voted for the Front for Victory in last year\u2019s elections.Those allegations stem from a number of continuing cases that have gripped Argentines in recent years. One is a money-laundering investigation involving L\u00e1zaro B\u00e1ez, a construction baron from Patagonia, who has been indicted and is in jail as the investigation progresses.Investigators have also accused Mr. B\u00e1ez of redirecting some funds from the public-works contracts to the Kirchners via schemes involving the family\u2019s hotel and real estate businesses.Prosecutors are investigating whether Mr. B\u00e1ez\u2019s companies paid for block bookings at hotels without ever occupying the rooms. Similarly, it is alleged that Mr. B\u00e1ez kicked back money to the Kirchners through lease agreements to rent the family\u2019s Patagonian properties.Gerardo Pollicita, the lead prosecutor in the hotels case, turned down several interview requests. But in a recent filing, he wrote that the investigation sought to establish whether Mr. Kirchner and Mrs. Kirchner were engaged in a criminal conspiracy involving \u201ccronies\u201d like Mr. B\u00e1ez who in return for business favors from the government channeled funds to the presidential family.Mrs. Kirchner has directed scorn at Claudio Bonadio, a judge who is guiding the investigation into alleged kickbacks to her family\u2019s real estate business. He was taken off the hotels case last year amid concerns over his impartiality.In an interview at his office at Comodoro Py, a run-down courthouse here, Judge Bonadio denied the existence of a coterie of judges and prosecutors plotting against Mrs. Kirchner. He said he simply worked on whatever cases were sent his way. Judge Bonadio said judges treated criminal law as golfers did a tournament, thinking only of the case file \u2014 or hole \u2014 before them.\u201cWe\u2019re golfers, not baseball players or footballers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe play against the course, not another team.\u201dMany experts contend, however, that Argentina\u2019s judiciary is not independent. Federal judges, said Luis Moreno Ocampo, a leading Argentine anticorruption campaigner who was chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court, tend to operate in favor of whichever politicians are in power, only seriously pursuing them once they leave office.This politicization is often traced back to Mr. Menem, the former president, whose former economy minister once claimed he was passed a napkin by another minister scribbled with the names of judges Mr. Menem controlled. \u201cThe biggest issue is moving Argentina\u2019s legal system out of this swamp,\u201d Mr. Moreno Ocampo said. Still, he added, \u201cthe focus should not just be on past corruption but on preventing future corruption.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Age of Post-Truth Politics", "Date": "2016-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorFacts hold a sacred place in Western liberal democracies. Whenever democracy seems to be going awry, when voters are manipulated or politicians are ducking questions, we turn to facts for salvation.For the Brexit referendum, Leave argued that European Union membership costs Britain 350 million pounds a week, but failed to account for the money received in return.The sense is widespread: We have entered an age of post-truth politics.As politics becomes more adversarial and dominated by television performances, the status of facts in public debate rises too high. We place expectations on statistics and expert testimony that strains them to breaking point. Rather than sit coolly outside the fray of political argument, facts are now one of the main rhetorical weapons within it.How can we still be speaking of \u201cfacts\u201d when they no longer provide us with a reality that we all agree on? The problem is that the experts and agencies involved in producing facts have multiplied, and many are now for hire. If you really want to find an expert willing to endorse a fact, and have sufficient money or political clout behind you, you probably can.The combination of populist movements with social media is often held responsible for post-truth politics. Individuals have growing opportunities to shape their media consumption around their own opinions and prejudices, and populist leaders are ready to encourage them.But to focus on recent, more egregious abuses of facts is to overlook the ways in which the authority of facts has been in decline for quite some time. Newspapers might provide resistance to the excesses of populist demagogy, but not to the broader crisis of facts.The problem is the oversupply of facts in the 21st century: There are too many sources, too many methods, with varying levels of credibility, depending on who funded a given study and how the eye-catching number was selected.In the centuries that followed, accounting was joined by statistics, economics, surveys and a range of other numerical methods. But even as these methods expanded, they tended to be the preserve of small, tight-knit institutions, academic societies and professional associations who could uphold standards. National statistical associations, for example, soon provided the know-how for official statistics offices, affiliated with and funded by governments.In the 20th century, an industry for facts emerged. Market-research companies began to conduct surveys in the 1920s and extended into opinion polling in the 1930s. Think tanks like the American Enterprise Institute were established during and after World War II to apply statistics and economics to the design of new government policies, typically in the service of one political agenda or another. The idea of \u201cevidence-based policy,\u201d popular among liberal politicians in the late 1990s and early 2000s, saw economics being heavily leaned on to justify government programs, in an allegedly post-ideological age.Of course the term \u201cfact\u201d isn\u2019t reserved exclusively for numbers. But it does imply a type of knowledge that can be reliably parceled out in public, without constant need for verification or interpretation.Yet there is one much more radical contributor to our post-truth politics that could ultimately be as transformative of our society as accounting proved to be 500 years ago.We are in the middle of a transition from a society of facts to a society of data. During this interim, confusion abounds surrounding the exact status of knowledge and numbers in public life, exacerbating the sense that truth itself is being abandoned.The place to start in understanding this transition is with the spread of \u201csmart\u201d technologies into everyday life, sometimes called the \u201cinternet of things.\u201d Thanks to the presence of smartphones and smartcards in our pockets, the dramatic uptake of social media, the rise of e-commerce as a means of purchasing goods and services, and the spread of sensory devices across public spaces, we leave a vast quantity of data in our wake as we go about our daily activities.Like statistics or other traditional facts, this data is quantitative in nature. What\u2019s new is both its unprecedented volume (the \u201cbig\u201d in big data) and also the fact that it is being constantly collected by default, rather than by deliberate expert design. Numbers are being generated much faster than we have any specific use for. But they can nevertheless be mined to get a sense of how people are behaving and what they are thinking.The promise of facts is to settle arguments between warring perspectives and simplify the issues at stake. For instance, politicians might disagree over the right economic policy, but if they can agree that \u201cthe economy has grown by 2 percent\u201d and \u201cunemployment is 5 percent,\u201d then there is at least a shared stable reality that they can argue over.The promise of data, by contrast, is to sense shifts in public sentiment. By analyzing Twitter using algorithms, for example, it is possible to get virtually real-time updates on how a given politician is perceived. This is what\u2019s known as \u201csentiment analysis.\u201dThere are precedents for this, such as the \u201cworm\u201d that monitors live audience reaction during a televised presidential debate, rising and falling in response to each moment of a candidate\u2019s rhetoric. Financial markets represent the sentiments of traders as they fluctuate throughout the day. Stock markets never produce a fact as to what Cisco is worth in the way that an accountant can; they provide a window into how thousands of people around the world are feeling about Cisco, from one minute to the next.Journalists and politicians can no more ignore a constant audit of collective mood than C.E.O.s can ignore the fluctuations in their companies\u2019 share prices. If the British government had spent more time trying to track public sentiment toward the European Union and less time repeating the facts of how the British economy benefited from membership in the union, it might have fought the Brexit referendum campaign differently and more successfully.Dominic Cummings, one of the leading pro-Brexit campaigners, mocked what he called outdated polling techniques. He also asked one pollster to add a question on \u201centhusiasm,\u201d and, employing scientists to mine very large, up-to-the-minute data sets, to gauge voter mood and to react accordingly with ads and voter-turnout volunteers.It is possible to live in a world of data but no facts. Think of how we employ weather forecasts: We understand that it is not a fact that it will be 75 degrees on Thursday, and that figure will fluctuate all the time. Weather forecasting works in a similar way to sentiment analysis, bringing data from a wide range of sensory devices, and converting this into a constantly evolving narrative about the near future.However, this produces some chilling possibilities for politics. Once numbers are viewed more as indicators of current sentiment, rather than as statements about reality, how are we to achieve any consensus on the nature of social, economic and environmental problems, never mind agree on the solutions?Conspiracy theories prosper under such conditions. And while we will have far greater means of knowing how many people believe those theories, we will have far fewer means of persuading them to abandon them.William Davies is an associate professor in political economy at Goldsmiths, University of London, and the author of \u201cThe Happiness Industry: How the Government and Big Business Sold Us Well-Being.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside the Conservative Push for States to Amend the Constitution", "Date": "2016-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTaking advantage of almost a decade of political victories in state legislatures across the country, conservative advocacy groups are quietly marshaling support for an event unprecedented in the nation\u2019s history: a convention of the 50 states, summoned to consider amending the Constitution.But as the groups near their goal, critics and some skeptical constitutional scholars are warning that holding an amendment-writing meeting with no historical parallel and no written rules could open a Pandora\u2019s box of constitutional mischief.That will by no means be easy. Even if the two-thirds threshold were reached, a convention would probably face a court battle over whether the legislatures\u2019 calls for a convention were sufficiently similar. And as with any amendment that Congress proposes, state-written amendments would need approval by three-quarters of the states \u2014 either by their legislatures or by state conventions \u2014 to take effect.\u201cI think the prospect is very good in 2017,\u201d said Gary Banz, a Republican who is the majority whip in the Oklahoma House of Representatives. \u201cYou can look at any number of states that are not on board yet, and they\u2019re controlled by very conservative elements.\u2019\u2019The juggernaut nature of the convention movement has almost overshadowed the longstanding debate about its motivation: to imbue the Constitution with a binding limit on federal spending.Supporters say the philosophy that state governments and ordinary people usually adhere to \u2014 that it is wrong and destructive to spend beyond one\u2019s income \u2014 should apply to the federal government as well. In that view, the $19.4 trillion national debt threatens to destroy Americans\u2019 future prosperity.\u201cIt\u2019s immoral for one generation to borrow and spend beyond its means and leave the bill to the next generation,\u201d said Scott Rogers, the director of the Balanced Budget Amendment Task Force.But opponents say an amendment, not the deficit, is the threat. A government that could not run deficits, they argue, would not be able to stimulate the economy during recessions, when job-creating spending is most needed. And it would not be able to elude budget ceilings for benefits like Social Security, or for job-creating projects like highways that are financed with debt.In truth, they say, debt is a fact of life for both states and ordinary households \u2014 in bond issues that finance revenue generators like convention centers and bridges, and for ordinary necessities like cars, kitchen remodelings and homes. Banning deficit spending, they say, would bring the economy to a halt.But the basic argument for federal frugality has broad appeal. Polls generally indicate strong support for a balanced-budget amendment, and advocates persuaded 32 state legislatures to back an amendment convention during the Reagan administration.Yet debate over an amendment\u2019s merits has taken a back seat to a more fundamental question: whether delegates to a convention could be trusted not to tinker with other parts of the Constitution.Article 5 places no limits on a convention\u2019s power. Some experts note that the Constitution itself arose from a convention called to amend its predecessor, the Articles of Confederation \u2014 and tore up the document and started from scratch. That convention even scrapped the Articles\u2019 terms of ratification \u2014 unanimous approval by the states \u2014 and substituted a lower barrier, three-fourths of states. (Some pro-amendment conservatives argue that the delegates to Philadelphia did not go rogue, but always planned to rewrite the Articles.)Michael J. Gerhardt, a University of North Carolina law professor and scholar in residence at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, said Article 5\u2019s reticence gave states leeway to improvise.\u201cOnce you have a convention, then in some respects it becomes a free-for-all,\u201d he said. \u201cAll bets are off.\u201dAdvocates scoff at the hand-wringing. Conventions of states, they say, are nothing new: About three dozen met from the 1700s to 1922 \u2014 most before the Constitution was drafted \u2014 considering everything from trade to slavery to divvying up the Colorado River\u2019s water. Most did not include every state, but each generally followed a preset agenda. A convention to draft amendments, they say, would be no different.There is, though, one signal difference: None of those meetings bore the Constitution\u2019s blessing. One, in 1861, did propose an amendment to avert an impending civil war, but it was an ad hoc affair, not an Article 5 meeting.But even if it did, he said, he would not be especially concerned: After all, a convention only proposes amendments.\u201cThe very terms of Article 5 state that proposals aren\u2019t valid unless they\u2019re ratified by three-fourths of the states,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no controversial idea on the left or the right that won\u2019t have 13 states against it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin Dismisses Sergei Ivanov, a Longtime Ally, as Chief of Staff", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMemo From RussiaMOSCOW \u2014 President Vladimir V. Putin unexpectedly fired his longtime chief of staff on Friday, the latest in a series of high-profile Kremlin changes that have ushered out an older layer of Putin peers and replaced them with a younger generation of unquestioning loyalists.The changes come amid a spike in foreign and domestic tensions that might arrive as a welcome \u2014 or manufactured, as some have suggested \u2014 diversion for a nation depressed by a long stretch of economic hardships brought on by the collapse of oil prices and Western economic sanctions for Mr. Putin\u2019s adventures in Crimea and eastern Ukraine.Mr. Putin on Wednesday accused the Ukrainian government of plotting terrorist attacks in Crimea, saying, \u201cCertainly we won\u2019t ignore such things.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s president dismissed the claims as \u201cabsurd and cynical,\u201d but Ukrainian troops near Crimea and in southeastern Ukraine were put on high alert. On Friday, the Russian Defense Ministry announced that the new S-400 air defense missile system had been deployed in Crimea.At home, as the campaign season starts for Sept. 18 parliamentary elections, Mr. Putin is seen as focused on whipping up enthusiasm for his United Russia party.Kremlin decisions like this are often opaque. The change was officially cast as a mutual decision initiated by Mr. Ivanov, who instead of acting as one of the most powerful men in the country, shaping the agenda for the presidential administration, will now be a special envoy for transportation and the environment.\u201cI am pleased with your performance in the areas you supervised,\u201d Mr. Putin said to Mr. Ivanov, who like the president is a veteran of the K.G.B., the Soviet-era security service, and worked with Mr. Putin in St. Petersburg in the early 1990s.Mr. Putin said the two men had agreed when Mr. Ivanov was appointed chief of staff in late 2011 that he would stay for no more than four years.In their staged meeting, Mr. Ivanov seconded that notion, saying that he indeed wanted to move on and thanked the president \u201cfor your high regard for the work I have done over the past 17 years.\u201dMr. Ivanov, who has a reputation as a hawk, served as defense minister from 2001 to 2007. Considered one of Mr. Putin\u2019s closest allies, he was sometimes mentioned as a possible successor when terms limits forced Mr. Putin to leave office in 2008.Some viewed Mr. Ivanov as the most recent casualty in what seemed to be an orchestrated plan by Mr. Putin, 63, to install a new generation of \u201cservants\u201d to replace his contemporaries, who might still have had the standing to occasionally question his decisions.\u201cSergei Ivanov\u2019s dismissal is a sign of Vladimir Putin\u2019s focus on replacing his old friends at top posts in the executive branch with members of the servant staff, however high-ranking and polished they might be,\u201d said Stanislav Belkovsky, a political analyst, speaking on Echo of Moscow radio station. \u201cPsychologically, it\u2019s now more comfortable for Putin to deal with just that kind of people \u2014 people who from the very beginning look on him as a grand chief and who don\u2019t remember those times when Vladimir Putin wasn\u2019t a grand chief yet.\u201dAnother old Putin ally from St. Petersburg, Andrei Belyaninov, was forced to resign as the head of the customs office in July, after agents with the F.S.B. state security service searched his house and found hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash stashed in shoe boxes.In years past, Mr. Putin\u2019s close associates had been spared such public shaming, but analysts pointed to several reasons for the new treatment.First, the country has been in recession for two years, and with parliamentary elections coming up Mr. Putin wants to show that his administration is looking out for the general welfare with fresh blood and fresh ideas.Mr. Ivanov was also responsible for helping shape the Kremlin\u2019s image, which has not been aided in recent months by unfeeling comments, particularly from Dmitri A. Medvedev, the prime minister.In one public encounter he suggested that schoolteachers unsatisfied with their pay should go into business, and in another told a retiree in Crimea that there was no money to raise pensions. \u201cThere just isn\u2019t any money now,\u201d Mr. Medvedev said, before fleeing the encounter with a cheery, \u201cYou hang in there!\u201dSome analysts suggested that Mr. Putin is provoking a new confrontation with Ukraine to finally resolve the political stalemate in eastern Ukraine in his favor and, given the dismay within the electorate over the economy, to secure votes for his supporters in Parliament and produce a show of national solidarity.Analysts have also detected another trend in recent appointments, with Mr. Putin naming former bodyguards and intelligence agents to important political posts, such as regional governors.When Yevgeny Zinichev was appointed acting governor of the Kaliningrad region last month, reporters were surprised to find him in earlier pictures working as the president\u2019s bodyguard.And when Mr. Putin organized a new, powerful national guard last year answering directly to the president, he promoted a former bodyguard, Viktor V. Zolotov, to the rank of army general and made him the director. The new head of customs, Vladimir Bulavin, worked earlier as deputy chief of the F.S.B.Mr. Putin, the former head of the F.S.B., the successor agency to the K.G.B., was already inclined to trust former bodyguards and members of the agency for their unquestioning loyalty.That outlook only deepened, given that the wars in Ukraine and Syria have thrust him together more often with advisers from the military and the security services, some analysts pointed out.\u201cA general from the Ministry of Defense or the F.S.B. will not ask unnecessary questions, or look at Putin through the eyes of a former friend who still expects special treatment,\u201d wrote Ms. Stanovaya of the Carnegie Moscow Center.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Deadly Wildfires on Portuguese Island of Madeira Reach Its Largest City", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by10 PhotosFirefighters on the Portuguese island of Madeira continued on Thursday to battle wildfires that have reached Funchal, the island\u2019s largest city, killing three people and destroying over 150 homes, while the national government sought help to deal with nearly 200 blazes on the mainland.Prime Minister Ant\u00f3nio Costa planned to travel to Madeira on Thursday, and Portugal activated a European Union plan to get emergency assistance. Italy has already sent one firefighting aircraft. Madeira is the largest island in an archipelago in the Atlantic Ocean that lies about 360 miles off the Moroccan coast, and about 600 miles southwest of Lisbon.The biggest fire on Madeira broke out on Monday and rapidly encroached on the residential outskirts of Funchal, home to about 110,000 people.The fires also set off a debate over whether the authorities had responded with sufficient speed and adequate means, especially in light of previous fire disasters in the hot and dry summer months.The police have arrested two people in an inquiry into whether the Madeira fires were started deliberately. People have also been detained on the mainland, where criminal acts are believed to be behind several major fires.By Wednesday afternoon, there were 186 fires burning in mainland Portugal, mostly in the northern part of the country, according to the Civil Protection Agency, a dozen of which were labeled major fires that were out of control.In the first nine days of August, nearly 62,000 acres burned across Portugal, according to the authorities.Strong winds and high temperatures have complicated the efforts of the more than 4,000 firefighters and other emergency workers who have been deployed on Madeira and in mainland Portugal to fight the blazes. One forestry official died on the mainland.The fires also threaten to hurt Portugal\u2019s tourism industry at the peak of the summer vacation season.A luxury hotel on the outskirts of Funchal was among the buildings gutted by fire, and some of the island\u2019s other hotels have been forced to evacuate guests. More than 1,000 residents have been moved to emergency shelters.The Madeira authorities said on Wednesday that two people who had been hospitalized remained in serious condition, and that one person was missing.Mr. Costa\u2019s trip to Madeira is part of a broader effort by the government to evaluate the situation and to determine how much emergency financial aid should be given to Madeira.Thanks to its mild winters, Madeira has developed a year-round tourism industry. The roughly one million visitors each year account for about one-fifth of the region\u2019s economy.Among those offering financial support is Cristiano Ronaldo, the Real Madrid soccer star and a native of Madeira, who spoke by telephone with Miguel Albuquerque, the president of Madeira\u2019s regional government, according to the Portuguese news media.Fires also raged overnight in southern France, as nearly 1,800 firefighters battled blazes that had already burned over 8,000 acres of brush and pine forest north of the port city of Marseille, damaging houses and injuring at least three people.French authorities said Thursday morning that the fires had either been put out or were under control, including near the town of Fos-sur-Mer, which has a concentration of oil and petrochemical facilities.But the authorities also cautioned that the risk of fires picking up again was high because of strong winds and dry vegetation.Four firefighters were wounded in the department of H\u00e9rault, west of Marseille, where a separate series of blazes was brought under control Wednesday evening.Near Marseille, 500 people were evacuated, mainly from the town of Vitrolles, but the local authorities allowed them to return to their homes Thursday. Highways near the fires were still closed Thursday morning, and air traffic at the Marseille airport, just west of Vitrolles, was still disrupted.Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Beat, and the Bug Spray, Go On in South Beach Despite Zika Threat", "Date": "2016-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMIAMI BEACH \u2014 Michal Keren David stood alone amid the confectionery swirl that draws millions to the adult playground of South Beach, clutching not a minty mojito or even a ubiquitous cellphone, but one of the very latest symbols of life here: mosquito repellent.As she spritzed herself next to a sidewalk cafe on Lincoln Road, Ms. David lamented her ill timing. Just Friday morning, as she headed to fly out of New York, bound for a weekend in Miami, she said she learned the latest news about Zika. The mosquito-borne virus, which can cause birth defects in fetuses, had found a new, albeit small, home on South Beach.Ordinarily, she said, she might have simply shrugged off the news.\u201cI\u2019m thinking of trying to get pregnant in the next month,\u201d said Ms. David, 32. \u201cWe thought maybe about canceling, but we also thought we have to live our lives. This will get to New York City, too. It will be all over the place.\u201dOn Friday, this rollicking southern slice of Miami Beach, a place long accustomed to boom and bust, downtrodden and glamorous, became the second official target zone of the Zika-carrying mosquito, Aedes aegypti, in the continental United States. The discovery forced the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to advise pregnant women not to venture into a 1.5-square-mile area from Eighth to 28th Streets on one side and from the beach to the Intracoastal Waterway on the other. But federal health officials also warned them to consider postponing travel anywhere in Miami-Dade County.As local government and tourism officials emphasized that the safety of residents, workers and guests came first, it was hard to sidestep the obvious: Would tourists stay away from the island\u2019s alluring beaches, hip hotels and just-about-anything-goes clubs? And if they did, what would it mean for the economy of Miami Beach \u2014 the superstar of the county\u2019s $36 billion tourism industry?\u201cAs we said before, we will do everything in our power so that people feel safe,\u201d said Miami Beach\u2019s mayor, Philip Levine, stressing that \u201cMiami Beach is having a record summer.\u201dMapping where Zika infections have been reported.From one moment to the next, a new protocol has taken root, one gleaned from the lessons learned in Wynwood, the small arts district across the bay that became the virus\u2019s first hub of active transmission in the continental United States. Wynwood has suffered a sharp decline in business.Some hotels here began to slip Zika information sheets under the doors of the guest rooms. Bartenders offered patrons cans of repellent along with their shaken martinis. Electric fans, already in use to soften the suffocating heat and humidity, were cranked up high, all the easier to thwart Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.At Meat Market, a steakhouse on Lincoln Road, a teeming pedestrian mall, citronella candles quickly appeared under a row of outdoor tables on Friday moments after the news broke. Employees were asked to wear bug spray until repellent wristbands arrived.\u201cWe never really have a lot of mosquitoes,\u201d said David Tornek, the restaurant\u2019s chief executive, who said he hoped the problem was fleeting. He paused and added, \u201cYou hope that people look at this rationally.\u201dThe reaction from tourists here, many of them from Europe and Latin America, seemed to swing from panicked to nonchalant.As she sat on a patch of artificial turf eating pizza and watching her 6-year-old son play paddle ball, Vania Acosta \u2014 who is Cuban by way of Naples, Italy, and is visiting South Beach with family \u2014 said she quickly became paranoid.\u201cI bought 40 cans of bug spray,\u201d Ms. Acosta said, a turban atop her head. \u201cI am spraying repellent in my room, in my house, right here. What worries me is that they don\u2019t know enough about it. When I heard yesterday, I wanted to leave.\u201dBut she is staying; it is too complicated to leave. And, she said, she is enamored of the South Beach vibe, a mix of ethnicities and lifestyles, where Prada-shod women stride past tattoo-decorated Doc Martens lovers, all to the murmur of palm trees and foreign languages. \u201cLike the woman I saw wearing a long black cover-up and a white wedding veil,\u201d she said. \u201cI love it here; I love the people here.\u201dStrolling past Art Deco hotels on Ocean Drive, South Beach\u2019s most crowded stretch, Lorenzo Villa, 24, a graduate student at West Virginia University who arrived Friday morning for a week\u2019s vacation, made one accommodation: He bought bug repellent. Beyond that, he expects his vacation will be worry free.\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an issue,\u201d said Mr. Villa, who was born in Argentina and grew up in Annapolis, Md. \u201cI don\u2019t see any mosquitoes. Maybe it\u2019s only a problem if there\u2019s a big swarm. I\u2019m pretty chill.\u201dThere are mosquitoes on Miami Beach, but, with its strong breezes and saltwater barriers, the chain of islands is less hospitable to mosquitoes than other parts of the county. But it is also dense, with plenty of old buildings full of nooks and crannies. The city is also hampered in turning to a tactic that helped Wynwood reduce its population of aegypti: the aerial spraying of Naled. The area, with its beaches, ocean and high-rise buildings, is not suited for it, county officials said.Getting tourists to comply with Zika-busting rules, though, will not be easy. People come here to escape obligations and to strip down to the bare essentials. Long sleeves and admonishments are not really welcome. Sex, though, is often on a to-do list, raising concerns that the virus will spread through sexual transmission.For the most part, those visitors who are not pregnant or pondering pregnancy seemed unfazed and crisis-fatigued.\u201cThere is always something going on,\u201d said Yesenia Medina, 40, a respiratory therapist from Miami who sat at an outdoor bar, Campton Yard, which had installed automatic insecticide misters even before the Zika scare. \u201cNow it\u2019s Zika, and last month, it was something else.\u201dBut, with a laugh, Ms. Medina said she heard a rescue plan was in the works. \u201cDonald Trump is building a net over the beach, and he\u2019s getting the mosquitoes to pay for it,\u201d she said, riffing on the Republican presidential nominee\u2019s plan to erect a wall on the Southern border and have Mexico pay for it.As the sun inched below the horizon and a near-full moon glinted over the ocean, Claudia Iraheta, 21, a hostess, stood nearby at the Penguin Hotel cafe, cradling menus over her pronounced belly. The Zika virus is no casual concern for her. She is five months pregnant.\u201cIt\u2019s a baby girl,\u201d she said happily.Friday, she said, was an especially long and worrisome day. She thought twice about going to work, where she stands outside promoting the cafe to passers-by.\u201cI was scared, paranoid,\u201d said Ms. Iraheta, who moved to Miami from El Salvador a decade ago.But work is work, so she slathered on mosquito repellent and put on long pants, despite the sweltering heat. On Monday, she will head to the doctor to be tested for the virus. She says she does not think she has been exposed.\u201cIn the name of God, I hope not,\u201d Ms. Iraheta said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia\u2019s Acres, if Not Its Locals, Beckon Chinese Farmers", "Date": "2016-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOPYTNOE POLE, Russia \u2014 Perched in the cabin of a clunky Russian tractor, Li Chengbin, a 62-year-old peasant farmer from China, drove round and round in ever widening circles, plowing a field to get it ready for planting \u2014 and rejoicing at the opportunities offered by untamed lands in the Russian Far East almost empty of people.Back home in China, he said, he never had a plot anywhere near as big as the 82-acre spread that he and his son now farm in Russia. The vast majority of China\u2019s 300 million peasants have barely two acres. Mr. Li\u2019s family farm in China is even smaller.\u201cIn China, this much land would make me the biggest farmer in the country,\u201d Mr. Li said, yanking a rusty lever to try to get his puffing tractor to go faster. He and his son had bought the tractor, along with other decrepit farming equipment, from the remnants of a defunct Soviet-era collective farm.They got their land through an arrangement with a local woman who leases the formerly state farm property and lets Mr. Li and his son, Li Xin, farm it in return for cash.The weather, scorching in summer and well below freezing in winter, is not much worse than what they are used to in northern China. But because most of the swampy land on the Russian side of the nearby border has never been drained, the area is infested with giant mosquitoes and other bothersome bugs. A swarm of hornets, attracted by the heat generated by Mr. Li\u2019s tractor, enveloped the vehicle in a black cloud.Among Russian nationalists in Moscow and other cities in the west of the country, the presence of Chinese farmers on Russian land in the Far East has stirred frenzied fear of a stealthy Chinese takeover. It is a perennial obsession that, despite increasingly warm relations between the two countries\u2019 leaders, still exercises many Russian minds.Here in the Far East, however, local officials and many residents, while grumbling that they cannot keep up with Chinese work habits, tend to see China and its vast pool of industrious labor as the best hope of developing impoverished regions that often feel neglected by Moscow.Locals, she said, \u201chave much to learn from Chinese peasants.\u201dShe said there were no real figures for the number of Chinese working in the area as full-time hired hands for Russian landowners, seasonal laborers or as farmers on land they lease for themselves. But, Ms. Voron added, one thing was abundantly clear in a region that was originally set up by Stalin in the 1930s as a would-be Jewish homeland: \u201cThere are definitely many more Chinese here than Jews.\u201dWith a Russian population of just 1,716 people, Ms. Voron\u2019s district has only two Jewish families left \u2014 all the others moved to Israel or elsewhere \u2014 but it has hundreds of Chinese.Her daughter, Maria, who is the district administration chief, complained that many Chinese worked without registering and \u201csleep in the fields.\u201d But she, too, cheered their work ethic. \u201cThey all work like mad,\u201d she said, praising them for turning previously unused land into productive farms.Local men, many of them alcoholics, are less enthusiastic and curse the Chinese for getting up too early, using too much chemical fertilizer and overworking the land. Recently, the district administration was sent a video by an angry male resident that showed a Chinese-farmed field awash with bluish-gray slime allegedly created by chemicals and an irrigation project gone awry.The district chief said she had sent the video to the prosecutor\u2019s office for investigation.The Chinese began moving across the Amur River to farm in Russia in significant numbers after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. The mostly uncontrolled influx drew howls of protest from nationalist politicians in Moscow.President Vladimir V. Putin, looking to China to add some spark to Russia\u2019s sluggish economy and to show Western leaders that he does not need them, has tried to calm the scaremongering. But Russia still spasms with bouts of anti-Chinese sentiment.When the authorities in the Trans-Baikal region along China\u2019s border announced last year that they planned to lease about 285,000 unused acres to a Chinese company for grain production, the proposed deal triggered a storm of protest, mostly in the faraway European districts of Russia. The plan seems to have stalled.Under Mr. Putin, who first came to power at the end of 1999, the Russian authorities have tried and, to some extent, succeeded in regaining control of the migrant flow from China. They introduced a quota system for Chinese workers and channeled much of the transborder business through state-controlled entities.The rules are often flouted, and official corruption makes enforcement difficult. At the same time, fear of an unstoppable tide of Chinese taking over Russia\u2019s eastern lands is rooted in nationalist mythmaking, not reality, said Ivan Zuenko, a researcher at the Far Eastern Federal University in Vladivostok who has studied the Chinese involvement in Russian agriculture.\u201cMoscow and St. Petersburg know nothing about the Far East and think that all Chinese want to come here,\u201d he said, adding that locals \u201crealize that China means jobs and salaries.\u201dMr. Li and his son regularly hire Russians to help in the field, paying them the equivalent of nearly $15 a day. They said the Russians worked hard when they had to, but often showed up late. On a recent morning, two villagers turned up at the Li family\u2019s field at 10:45 a.m. for what was supposed to be an early start. Mr. Li shrugged and set them to work.That Russia has so much spare land is partly the result of geography. Its Far Eastern regions are two-thirds the size of the entire United States and sparsely populated with only 6.1 million people. But it also stems from the collapse of the Soviet Union and with it an elaborate system of subsidized collective farms. Land under cultivation in the Far East, most of it in a narrow strip of relatively fertile land along the border with China, slumped by nearly 60 percent between 1990 and 2006, leaving huge tracts of good land untended as Russian villagers drifted away to find work elsewhere.Across the border in China at the same time, the opposite happened. The population soared, and even the most unpromising land came under cultivation, leaving millions of peasants hungry for soil. Heilongjiang, the Chinese region just 50 miles from here across the Amur River, has more than 38 million people, more than 200 times the population of the Jewish Autonomous Region.The younger Mr. Li, who is 35, said he had first come to Russia about a decade ago to work as a farm laborer. He learned some Russian and set up a pig farm with a local woman, Nelya Zarutskaya. He, his father and an uncle now live in a ramshackle farm building along with Ms. Zarutskaya and her young son.District officials say Mr. Li and Ms. Zarutskaya married, a common ruse used to jump bureaucratic hurdles that make it difficult for foreigners to get access to land. \u201cWe have lots of fake marriages,\u201d Ms. Voron, the district chief, said.

{"Headline": "Alibaba Reports Growth, Even as China\u2019s Economy Stumbles", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s economic growth is slowing, but its biggest online marketplaces are doing just fine.Alibaba Group, China\u2019s largest e-commerce company, reported strong revenue growth on Thursday as it continued to lure shoppers to its websites. The company, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, also earned more money from vendors, who pay to sell and advertise their goods on its sites.The company said sales rose 59 percent in the first quarter to $4.8 billion. Its operating profit rose 71 percent to $1.3 billion.For many American investors, Alibaba is seen as a proxy for the health of the Chinese economy and the strength of its consumers. The company has outperformed the broader retail market in China. It has also been investing in the growth of e-commerce in the country \u2014 focusing on logistics and on rural areas where fewer people are online \u2014 so it can continue to grow even as the country\u2019s economy slows.The company is also working hard to brace itself for a further slowdown in China, pushing out of its conventional online shopping business into cloud computing, entertainment through online video and gaming, and even a food delivery business. Those long-term efforts have had mixed results. Results this quarter, for instance, showed that the company\u2019s smartphone-based food delivery business, Koubei, continued to burn cash competing with rivals.Yet other sectors have been more promising. Alibaba\u2019s cloud computing service, which is similar to the one offered by Amazon, has quickly gained traction in China, where businesses have been relying on Alibaba for computing power.Alibaba\u2019s gross merchandise volume, a closely watched measure of the transactions on the company\u2019s websites, grew 24 percent compared with the same period a year earlier, about the same pace as the prior quarter.Investors bid Alibaba\u2019s shares up more than 2 percent in premarket trading on the results.The underlying assumption that slowing growth in China will eventually hurt Alibaba\u2019s sales has focused more attention on its other businesses. During its recent investor day, Alibaba said it would start to offer more information on its efforts in sectors like entertainment and food delivery.\u201cWe have already started to see early signs of business breakthroughs in new categories and some of its burgeoning growth assets,\u201d Evan Zhou, a Credit Suisse analyst, wrote in a recent report.Yet those new breakthroughs come with risk. In the cloud computing sector, Alibaba has to contend with foreign rivals, and it faces a domestic challenge from the search engine Baidu. Its food delivery business risks becoming a drain on earnings, as many similar companies fight to gain customers by offering big commissions to drivers.Alibaba has also recently increased its focus on international expansion. While much of its efforts are centered on bringing foreign vendors to sell to Chinese consumers \u2014 and in turn spending marketing dollars on Alibaba\u2019s platforms \u2014 the company has also made bets on e-commerce in neighboring developing markets.The company invested in the Indian commerce companies Paytm and Snapdeal, and this year, it made its largest overseas acquisition, paying $1 billion to take over Lazada, a popular Southeast Asian shopping website.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Adopts G.O.P. Tax Cuts, but Balks at Trade Pacts", "Date": "2016-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDonald J. Trump sought on Monday to move beyond a week of turmoil, using a major policy address to cast himself as a president who could bring new jobs and prosperity and warning that his rival, Hillary Clinton, would be a steward of stagnation.Saying he wanted \u201ca conversation about how to make America great again for everyone, and especially those who have the very least,\u201d Mr. Trump unveiled plans to simplify the tax system, rethink America\u2019s energy policy and tear up trade agreements.Mr. Trump chose Detroit as his backdrop, and his speech \u2014 though interrupted frequently by protesters \u2014 was clearly chosen to appeal to the working-class Americans who are at the center of his political strategy.It offered a broad view of what the economic agenda of a President Trump would look like: Tax policies that track closely with what Republicans in Congress have long advocated, including deep tax cuts for the wealthy and a light touch in regulation, but much more willingness to disrupt longstanding trade agreements and international economic relationships in hopes of reducing the trade deficit.He embraced a tax plan issued by House Republicans this year that would reduce taxes on all Americans but would especially benefit the affluent: It would lower the tax rate for the highest earners to 33 percent, from the current 39.6 percent.Mr. Trump also advocated \u201callowing parents to fully deduct the average cost of child care spending from their taxes.\u201d That might sound like a gain for average workers, but the way the tax code works, it would confer the greatest advantage to upper middle-class and wealthier families, and little to no benefit for vast numbers of low-income families.Get the latest national and state polls on the presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.For a family making $500,000 that spends $10,000 a year on child care, the tax deduction would be worth about $3,960. For a family that earns $50,000, because it faces a lower tax rate, it would be worth only $1,500. And many lower- and lower-middle-income families pay little or no federal income tax, so a tax deduction would not help them.In the speech and written materials distributed by his campaign, Mr. Trump mentioned only a tax deduction. But an emailed statement from his campaign Monday afternoon said the policy would also have elements to provide child care benefits to lower-income people. The statement said it would provide \u201ccredit to stay-at-home caregivers\u201d and that \u201cto provide benefits to lower-income taxpayers who may not benefit from the deduction, the plan also allows parents to exclude childcare expenses from half of their payroll taxes \u2014 increasing their paycheck income each week.\u201dMr. Trump also advocated reducing the corporate income tax rate to 15 percent from its current 35 percent. That proposal comes after a decade in which after-tax corporate profits have risen sharply as a share of national income and compensation for workers has fallen.\u201cWe will work with House Republicans on this plan, using the same brackets they have proposed: 12, 25 and 33 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cFor many American workers, their tax rate will be zero.\u201dThe conservative-leaning foundation found that the plan would reduce revenue by $2.4 trillion over the coming decade using \u201cstatic analysis,\u201d but that it would result in a comparatively modest revenue reduction of about $200 billion if you assume that lower taxes will result in much stronger economic growth.Other elements of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic agenda lack details that would make similar analysis possible. He proposed a moratorium on new regulations that would certainly warm the hearts of business interests that have complained of excessive regulation in the Obama era. But it is hard to know how much of a factor regulation has been in the sluggish economic growth of the last several years.And on energy policy, Mr. Trump reiterated his pledge to tear up the Paris climate agreement and halt the United States\u2019 payments to the United Nations for programs to reduce global warming. He said energy regulations were killing manufacturing jobs.\u201cThey tried to make these old tired ideas sound new,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said of Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks. \u201cHis tax plans will give super-big tax breaks to large corporations and the really wealthy.\u201dMr. Trump said his daughter Ivanka had advised him on the child care tax break, saying \u201cshe feels so strongly about this.\u201dWith protesters forcing him to halt his address roughly a dozen times, Mr. Trump restrained himself during the interruptions, although at one point he offered a glancing retort.\u201cBernie Sanders\u2019s people had far more energy and spirit,\u201d Mr. Trump said as one person was being escorted out of the venue by security.By laying out a broader framework of his plans for the economy, he used the speech at the Detroit Economic Club to try to refocus his campaign on the issues that could resonate with the Republican base, like spurring economic growth by cutting taxes. But he also sought to draw in working-class voters in swing states by proposing to penalize companies that move their operations to other countries and to renegotiate trade deals that do not favor American workers.Matt Flegenheimer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But if they are not getting work and want to come back home, I assure you that we will bring them home safe.\u201dSaudi Arabia and its wealthy Persian Gulf neighbors have long been top destinations for millions of poor laborers, most of whom work in construction, transport and other low-paying sectors.But the drop in oil prices to around $40 a barrel from more than $100 a barrel in June 2014 has undermined Persian Gulf economies, leaving countries like Saudi Arabia with large budget deficits and delaying payments to government contractors.Ms. Swaraj said that many of the unemployed workers were awaiting back wages after their work sites had closed down. There are more than three million Indian workers in Saudi Arabia, she said.Indian diplomats had managed to get food to laid-off workers living in five camps in Saudi Arabia as of Monday morning, Ms. Swaraj said.India is also trying to help those with no job prospects get home, a process complicated by Saudi restrictions on foreign labor. Human rights groups have accused Saudi Arabia and its neighbors of denying workers\u2019 rights by allowing employers to confiscate foreign workers\u2019 passports and not allowing them to leave the country without their employer\u2019s permission.Ms. Swaraj said the struggle to obtain documents from employers that would free workers to return to India was frequently made more difficult by the worsening economic situation.\u201cWhen the employer is no longer around, then where will we get the \u2018no objection\u2019 certificate?\u201d she asked.The Saudi government\u2019s budget difficulties have been felt most strongly in the construction sector, where contractors employ large work forces for huge infrastructure projects.In April, foreign laborers at Saudi Binladin Group, another construction giant, burned company buses during protests after not being paid for months.Ms. Swaraj said the Indian authorities were coordinating with Saudi Arabia to repatriate Indians who want to leave and trying to help unpaid workers to get their back wages. India\u2019s junior foreign minister, V. K. Singh, will fly to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to coordinate the Indian effort, she added.Many Indian workers have also lost their jobs in Kuwait, but the situation is worse in Saudi Arabia, Ms. Swaraj said in a Twitter post on Saturday.An article on Aug. 2 about the Indian government\u2019s efforts to support thousands of its citizens who have lost their jobs in Saudi Arabia with the drop in global oil prices misstated the price of oil in early August. It was about $40 a barrel, not $50.Ben Hubbard contributed reporting from Beirut, Lebanon.Advertisement"}

That analysis does not reflect changes that Mr. Trump unveiled on Monday, which reduced the size of his tax cuts. Previously, a range of analysts estimated his tax cuts could add about $10 trillion to the federal debt over 10 years. Reducing that cost presumably could in turn reduce analysts\u2019 projections of lost jobs and economic growth. But it remains unclear, because Mr. Trump did not provide enough detail to draw conclusions.__________In households with incomes below $50,000 \u2014 about 40 percent of all families \u2014 one out of three do not have access._______________The businessman has said his net worth is about $10 billion, though even some Republicans have expressed doubt and attributed Mr. Trump\u2019s refusal to release his federal income tax returns to the possibility those would prove he is worth less. The top rate for estate and gift taxes is 40 percent on amounts above $5.45 million (or double that, shielding the first $10.9 million from taxation, if his wife, Melania, survived him). Roughly apply that rate to $10 billion, and estate taxes would be in the range of $4 billion. Mrs. Clinton is also correct that most Americans, including wealthy ones, are not affected now by estate taxes. According to the Internal Revenue Service, they apply to 0.2 percent of estates.The Upshot\u2019s presidential forecast, updated daily.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In the U.S., VW Owners Get Cash. In Europe, They Get Plastic Tubes.", "Date": "2016-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe startling gap in treatment is the result of European laws that shield corporations from class-action suits brought by unhappy consumers. Now a group of online legal start-ups wants to change the status quo.The campaigns are attracting people like J\u00fcrgen Franz, a retired advertising executive in Munich who says his Volkswagen, a diesel Tiguan sport utility vehicle, burns more fuel after a software update that was part of a mandatory recall. He drives the same route every morning and now fills his tank more often.\u201cWhy are they getting so much and we\u2019re getting nothing?\u201d Mr. Franz said of American owners.Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers hope the efforts will signal a turning point in European jurisprudence, opening up a clearer path for aggrieved customers to join forces across borders to sue big corporations. The case could be the largest consumer action of its kind in Europe.Owners\u2019 representatives in Europe are seeking a maximum of 5,000 euros per car, or about $5,600, much less than in the United States. But even that figure could be financially devastating. There are 8.5 million tainted diesels in Europe, compared with about 500,000 in the United States that are covered by the settlement.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.European governments, traditionally deferential to Volkswagen, one of the region\u2019s largest employers, have joined in as well. The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, is coordinating efforts by national consumer groups to collect money from the carmaker. And the German state of Bavaria says it will sue Volkswagen on behalf of its employees\u2019 pension fund, which owns sharply devalued shares in the company.The biggest financial threat may come from new online businesses that have found ways around European obstacles to class-action suits.While laws vary, most European countries do not allow large class actions of the variety that led to the $15 billion settlement in the United States. Nor do many European countries, including Germany, allow lawyers to work on commission, so customers who sue companies risk paying not only their own legal fees but also the other side\u2019s if they lose.That is in contrast to the United States, where it is standard practice for lawyers to collect a hefty percentage of the award if a suit is successful and nothing if it\u2019s not.The start-ups are taking advantage of a loophole that allows European consumers to sign over their legal claims to third-party service providers, which then try to recover damages. And the internet has made it possible to recruit huge numbers of consumers who share similar gripes.People who search Google for the German words for \u201cVolkswagen damage claim\u201d see an ad for the website My-right.de, one of several start-ups using the internet to recruit Volkswagen owners. In Paris, Weclaim.com is attracting French customers. Both websites have teamed up with lawyers and are expanding into other European countries.The companies use technology to automate the laborious task of processing the claims, and usually find investors to finance legal costs in return for a share of the eventual judgment. The result is a de facto class action.\u201cThe model has existed for a long time,\u201d said Sven Bode, managing director of Financialright, the Hamburg-based company that owns My-right.de. \u201cWhat is new is that we can do it on a massive basis.\u201dMr. Bode has previously overseen efforts to help airline passengers obtain compensation for canceled or delayed flights, and to pressure banks to refund improper fees. But because Volkswagen is Europe\u2019s largest carmaker by far, Mr. Bode said, \u201cthis is a unique dimension.\u201dBecause the start-ups are considered collection agencies rather than law firms, they are allowed to work on commission. Clients who sign up agree to pay about a third of any money they collect, similar to contingency fees for lawyers in the United States. The Volkswagen owners owe nothing if the efforts to collect are unsuccessful.About 100,000 Volkswagen owners have registered with My-right.de so far, said Christopher Rother, managing partner of the law firm Hausfeld in Berlin, which is working with the website. The firm\u2019s founder, Michael Hausfeld, who is based in Washington, is one of the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers leading the class action against Volkswagen in the United States.That is only about 5 percent of the eligible owners in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Mr. Rother said the goal was to assemble at least 400,000 customers and collect up to \u20ac5,000 for each one.Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Pelouze, chief executive of Weclaim.com, the Paris-based website that is recruiting owners, said the carmaker was underestimating how vulnerable it was to new legal strategies. \u201cThe rules are changing, and I don\u2019t think Volkswagen is getting it,\u201d Mr. Pelouze said.For now, Volkswagen is standing firm.The American settlement allows owners to sell their cars back to Volkswagen at the pre-scandal price or take the cars in for an emissions upgrade, in addition to a cash payout of up to $10,000. All told, about $10 billion is earmarked for the buybacks, recalls and compensation, or about $20,000 per car.But the company has refused to give European owners any money or to buy back cars, disputing claims that diesels in Europe have lost value. It argues that dealers will be able to bring the cars in line with pollution standards without any decline in performance or fuel economy.Volkswagen has also refused to negotiate with owners\u2019 representatives. \u201cOur view is that there is no legal basis for customer claims,\u201d the company said in a statement.The carmaker has begun recalls in Germany that it plans to replicate in other countries. Vehicle owners will receive the software update and, in some cases, a tubular plastic \u201cflow transformer\u201d designed to improve air flow in the engine and to reduce emissions.That\u2019s it.But as in the United States, many people in Europe bought Volkswagen diesels thinking they were doing something good for the environment, only to learn that the cars emit far more poisonous nitrogen oxides than allowed.Guy Samson, a retired electrician who lives outside Paris, said that his friends gave him a hard time about his diesel Tiguan, and that its resale value had plunged.\u201cPeople, friends, they look at you and they kind of make fun of you behind your back,\u201d Mr. Samson said. \u201cEven to your face sometimes.\u201dMartin de Bourmont contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}

American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats across the region, especially in Somalia, and few if any countries in Africa receive as much Western aid.But that may be changing.\u201cIf you suffocate people and they don\u2019t have any other options but to protest, it breaks out,\u201d said Seyoum Teshome, a university lecturer in central Ethiopia. \u201cThe whole youth is protesting. A generation is protesting.\u201dAnalysts fear that separatist groups that had been more or less vanquished in recent years, like the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the turbulence and rearm.Several factors explain why bitter feelings, after years of simmering beneath the surface, are exploding now.The first is seemingly innocuous: smartphones.Only in the last couple of years have large numbers of Ethiopians been able to communicate using social media as cheaper smartphones became common and internet service improves. Even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it frequently does, especially during protests, many people are still able to communicate via internet proxies that mask where they are. Several young Ethiopians said this was how they gathered for protests.Second, there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, Ethiopia\u2019s two largest ethnic groups. Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies. For eons, Amharas from Ethiopia\u2019s predominantly Christian highlands flourished in politics and business, exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslim and live in lowland areas.But that is changing as well.\u201cWe are on the way to coordinate under one umbrella,\u201d said Mulatu Gemechu, an Oromo leader.The biggest protests have been in Amhara and Oromo areas. Many Amharas and Oromos feel Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and dominates the military, the intelligence services, commerce and politics.Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia\u2019s prime minister for 17 years, until his death from an undisclosed illness in 2012. He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around corners. Analysts say he was especially adept at detecting early signals of discontent and using emissaries to massage and defang opponents.\u201cThe current regime lacks that ground savvy,\u201d Mr. Abdi, the conflict analyst, said.Ethiopia\u2019s new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was plucked from relative obscurity to fill Mr. Meles\u2019s shoes. Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam is a southerner. Analysts say he does not have the trust of the Tigrayan-controlled security services.The result, many fear, is more bloodshed. The last time Ethiopia experienced such turmoil was in 2005, after thousands protested over what analysts have said appeared to be an election the government bungled and then stole. In the ensuing crackdown, many protesters were killed, though fewer than in recent months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.Development experts have praised Ethiopia\u2019s leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and measurable strides in fighting poverty. But clearly that has not stopped the internal resentment of Ethiopia\u2019s government from intensifying. And it is taking a dangerous ethnic shape.Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amhara town, attacked businesses owned by Tigrayans, and anti-Tigrayan hatred is becoming more common in social media.Analysts say the protests are putting the United States and other Western allies in an awkward position. The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, though it recently said it had closed that base.While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its ally in an already volatile region to crumble.\u201cThat,\u201d Mr. Abdi said, \u201cis a very tight rope to walk.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Did the Soviet Union Really End?", "Date": "2016-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAug. 22 is a holiday in Russia: It\u2019s Flag Day. But it ranks low in the hierarchy of holidays. There will be no parade, like there is on Victory Day. Russians will not get a day off, like they do on May Day, Russia Day, International Women\u2019s Day, Defenders of the Fatherland Day and a half-dozen other holidays. A visitor to the country would be unlikely to notice that this month Russia is marking the 25th anniversary of a historical milestone.What happened a quarter-century ago? On Aug. 18, 1991, four top Soviet officials flew to Crimea, where President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union was on vacation, and placed him under house arrest. The following day Soviet citizens awakened to the news that a committee of K.G.B., military and Soviet Communist Party leaders had declared a state of emergency. Then, over the course of three days, the coup crumbled.On Aug. 21, its failure became evident, and Moscow authorities soon removed a giant statue of the founder of the secret police, Felix Dzerzhinsky, from its pedestal in the center of the city. A Russian flag \u2014 white, blue and red stripes \u2013 went up over the building of the Russian Supreme Soviet, the nominal legislative body, in Moscow. Only three people died in Moscow streets before the attempted coup was over.Two years earlier, a series of popular protests led by young pro-democracy activists had brought down the Communist governments of several Eastern European countries. These became known as the Revolutions of 1989. Most had been peaceful; the Czechs called theirs \u201cvelvet.\u201d The ruling parties had simply capitulated. In many books published in the West, and in the minds of some Russian intellectuals, the three days of August 1991 were the Russian version of a velvet revolution, and they have been memorialized as the end of the Soviet Union.But they were neither the end of the Soviet Union nor a velvet revolution. Twenty-five years later, this is perhaps clearer than ever.By the summer of 1991, the Soviet empire had been in agony for a couple of years. Each of its 15 constituent republics, including Russia, had popular pro-independence movements. Ethnic conflicts and border disputes were flaring up all over; blood had been shed. Mr. Gorbachev was zigzagging between military and peaceful solutions to the mounting crises. The Soviet state had used force in Azerbaijan, Georgia and Lithuania, killing scores of people and bitterly disappointing all who wanted change. Yet the hard-liners, who made up the majority of the Soviet leadership, saw Mr. Gorbachev as too soft. Like any leader who tries to appease everyone, Mr. Gorbachev was hated by many and disliked by most. But his fiercest struggle was with Boris Yeltsin, a former party boss who in June 1991 became the popularly elected leader of the Russian republic within the U.S.S.R.The failure of the hard-liners\u2019 coup created an opening for Mr. Yeltsin. While Mr. Gorbachev was a hostage in Crimea, Mr. Yeltsin was in Moscow. He spoke to the anti-coup protesters in the city \u2013 from atop a tank, no less. After the coup was over, he was widely seen as the leader of a victorious resistance. He was now in a position to tell Mr. Gorbachev what to do.When Mr. Gorbachev returned to Moscow on Aug. 22 and began cleaning the ranks of the coup\u2019s many supporters, Mr. Yeltsin annulled several of Mr. Gorbachev\u2019s personnel appointments. He named his own men. He also made sure the Soviet Communist Party, whose leaders had engineered the coup, was effectively shut down, while the Russian Communist Party continued to function. In other words, Mr. Yeltsin moved to take over all key Soviet institutions, from the K.G.B. to the command center of the planned economy.Through the fall of 1991, constituent republics declared their independence from the U.S.S.R., one after another, while Mr. Gorbachev, who was still the Soviet president, scrambled to keep the union together. In December, Mr. Yeltsin and the leaders of Belarus and Ukraine met and agreed on the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Mr. Gorbachev was not invited. He was not even the first to know: He was informed by the Belarusian leader after Mr. Yeltsin had called President George H. W. Bush with the news. In the end, Mr. Gorbachev had to resign as president because his country was no more. Most of its institutions, along with its memberships in international organizations, passed to a new country called the Russian Federation.Mr. Yeltsin and his aides believed that what happened in Russia was better than any revolution, even a velvet one. They were convinced that by taking over existing institutions they would bring democracy to Russia faster, and less painfully, than they would by destroying them. They gave little thought to the fact that these were the institutions of a long-running totalitarian regime: They did not doubt that they had the will and strength necessary to transform them.But these institutions have turned out to be stronger than the men who had set out to reform them. They resisted change for nearly a decade, and once Vladimir V. Putin became president, they fell into place, easing Russia\u2019s regression. Today, life in Russia \u2013 where everything is political, where the population is mobilized around leader and nation, where censorship and one-party rule have effectively been restored \u2013 is more similar to life in the Soviet Union than at any point in the last 25 years.The monument to the three men who died during the failed coup of August 1991 \u2013 a plaque that few people know exists \u2013 is in disrepair, and discussions about erecting a proper, visible monument in its place died down years ago. But the Dzerzhinsky statue, which is displayed in a park not far from the Kremlin, was lovingly restored this summer, for at least the fourth time in the last few years.

{"Headline": "Some Villages in Italy May Never Recover From Earthquake", "Date": "2016-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Thursday, some of the nearly 130 people who once lived here returned, accompanied by firefighters, to try to retrieve a few belongings and mementos of a life that was obliterated in a few violent seconds of shaking.\u201cWhere was your bedroom?\u201d a young fireman asked a couple from under his yellow helmet.\u201cIt was where you see that white closet,\u201d the woman answered, indicating a few shelves without doors hanging open, over the hill. The sidewall of their two-story house collapsed down the slope, offering a glimpse of the intimacy of their lives.15 PhotosPescara del Tronto is gone. Perhaps five houses are left standing. And whether the place can ever be restored to the map seems an open question.The village is administratively part of the only slightly larger town of Arquata del Tronto, where 46 people are so far counted among the dead. For these largely isolated, hilltop towns in a rural region where the economy was already in decline, and where most of the permanent residents were already aging, the earthquake may be a coup de gr\u00e2ce, its own death knell.Towns in a mountainous stretch of central Italy were severely damaged by an earthquake that killed hundreds of people and trapped scores under debris.\u201cIt will be difficult for people to move back into Pescara del Tronto,\u201d Michele Franchi, vice mayor of Arquata del Tronto, said, speaking from the camp near the main town, where half the tower pinnacles collapsed. \u201cWe should even wonder whether it\u2019s wise to rebuild it right there, considering that it almost entirely came down.\u201d\u201cBut we need to move people out of tents quickly,\u201d he added. \u201cThey need to see a chance for life here to restart, where possible.\u201dA look at earthquakes in Italy that have caused extensive damage over the last century.Of the 300 who were in the village when the quake struck, many were people who kept weekend houses to take a break from Rome, about 95 miles away.Enza was in no spirit to provide her full name. Residents do not feel like talking in Pescara del Tronto. The police and rescue officials escorted the few residents who had the courage to come back the day after the tragedy, in silence.Enza came back to recover her elderly parents\u2019 medical devices and some clothes, so that they could feel somewhat less lost, she said. She was in Pescara del Tronto last weekend and went back to her work in Rome on Monday. Her brother took their parents safely into the street on Wednesday morning after the quake.The villages hit by the quake in the Marche region are along the ancient Roman road, the Via Salaria, that leads from Rome to the Adriatic Sea. Along this stretch of road, surrounded by green woods and high rocks, are now only cranes, tents and firefighters\u2019 jeeps and trucks. Officers assigned to different points of the road discouraged travelers from taking it.Pescara del Tronto has been a summer or weekend destination, but many travelers were not strictly tourists.\u201cThis place was home to me and to so many others,\u201d Enza said, breaking up in tears. \u201cNot just the physical place \u2014 we all knew each other, so we all lost many, many members of our extended family.\u201dEnza said that, beyond the pain for lost friends and acquaintances, the worst part now was already the creeping nostalgia for a place that may have died with so many of its residents.\u201cThere used to be a stone step where we always sat down,\u201d she said, pointing to a spot now buried under collapsed beams, roofs and stone bricks. \u201cOur memories are completely erased.\u201dAn ambulance passed by at full speed, sirens on, in the only narrow street leading into the town. Maybe one of her friends will become famous for being the last survivor taken out of the rubbles in Pescara del Tronto, Enza hoped.\u201cYou know, the worst is that this quake did not only take our future, but also took our past,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Syrians Seeking Asylum in South Korea Find Only a Cold Shoulder", "Date": "2016-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYANGJU, South Korea \u2014 Surrounded by salvaged used-cars parts bound for Syria, Ahmad Khalifa has worked 12 hours a day for three years in one country that does not really want him while longing for another that war has destroyed.In junkyards in South Korean towns like Yangju, north of Seoul, there are hundreds of young Syrian men like Mr. Khalifa, who often worked, ate and slept at job sites with no health insurance in pursuit of a dream for a better future.The Syrians\u2019 bosses, who paid the wages of the workers, no longer need their labor, but these military-age men are too scared to return home. South Korea, however, does not recognize them as refugees, despite appeals from the United Nations refugee agency to embrace more displaced Syrians with wider benefits.Instead, it is letting 670 Syrians like Mr. Khalifa stay here only on a so-called humanitarian visa, an annually renewable document that limits their ability to find work and bars them from many benefits open to recognized refugees, like health care and the opportunity to have family members join them.South Korea recognized its first non-Korean refugee, an Ethiopian, in 2001. So far, it has granted asylum to only 600 non-Korean refugees out of 18,800 applicants.In 2014, President Park Geun-hye promised that South Korea would pitch in to help resettle millions of refugees fleeing the Syrian civil war. By then, hundreds of Syrians had requested asylum in South Korea, most of them junkyard workers who were already here or friends and relatives who joined them after the war broke out. But South Korea\u2019s initially welcoming attitude soon waned.The government has granted asylum to only three Syrians. The rest were given humanitarian visas.Even while South Korea was handing out humanitarian visas at home, its embassies abroad and its airports tightened their screening.\u201cThey made us feel humiliated and small,\u201d said Mr. Mohammad Agha, 32.Twenty-eight Syrians who claimed asylum there after the Paris terrorist attacks in November languished in crowded, windowless rooms at the airport for up to eight months. They were allowed to enter South Korea in July to apply for refugee status, but only after human rights lawyers intervened and publicized their plight.\u201cThey told us to go elsewhere,\u201d said Ahmad, 23, one of the 28, who asked to be identified by his given name only. \u201cBut we had nowhere else to go, so we just waited and waited.\u201dTo Korean immigration officials, fleeing war is not sufficient grounds for asylum, said Chae Hyun-young, a legal officer at the United Nations\u2019 refugee office in Seoul. Applicants must also be at risk of persecution. \u201cAnd they focus on whether the applicant has suffered persecution in the past, rather than whether they would suffer in the future if returned home,\u201d Ms. Chae said.Ban Jae-yeol, an immigration official at the Incheon airport, said almost all Syrian asylum seekers were allowed to enter the country until the Paris attacks spawned a fear of refugees in South Korea. In January, the government had to scrap its plan to build a complex to produce and export halal food to Arab countries, after local Christian groups protested that it would help draw Muslims, and terrorism, to South Korea.The Justice Ministry promised more assistance for the holders of humanitarian visas, including job placement services. But officials were also taken aback by a sudden increase in asylum applicants, from 423 in 2010 to 5,711 last year, mostly from Pakistan, Egypt, Syria and China.In June, Kim Woo-hyun, the country\u2019s top immigration official, called for a revision of South Korea\u2019s refugee law to deal with economic migrants, including those overstaying their visas, who he said did not qualify as refugees but applied for asylum as a means to extend their stay. Asylum seekers are protected from deportation, and the legal process to screen them can take years, officials said.Ha Yong-guk, a Justice Ministry official, said four of every 10 people who applied for asylum last year did so while staying in the country illegally.Anxiety over a slowing domestic economy also led many South Koreans to suspect asylum seekers of stealing jobs, said Shin Heinn, a spokeswoman in Seoul for the United Nations refugee agency.On a recent Sunday, seven Syrian men gathered at an apartment in Yangju. They all came to South Korea in the past decade to work in junkyards. After the violence in Syria forced an end to shipments of auto parts from South Korea last year, they found themselves out of work. Local employers balked at hiring them because they held only temporary humanitarian visas. The Syrians all wished to be recognized as refugees, a status that they felt would be more secure and also better understood by local employers.\u201cBut all these problems are minor, compared with my fear for my family still in Aleppo,\u201d he said, looking at his two sons smiling from his cellphone screen.Advertisement"}

The strength of the dollar has weighed on global demand for American goods, while increasing American demand for foreign goods. Also, the agreement called for some import barriers to be reduced gradually.The proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, however, is partly an attempt to improve existing deals with South Korea and other Asian countries. There is evidence, for example, that South Korea has suppressed the value of its currency in recent years \u2014 but nothing in the current trade agreement prohibits South Korea from doing so. The proposed deal seeks to discourage that kind of currency manipulation._____The government lets all Americans reduce taxable income by a fixed amount. This standard deduction is $9,300 in 2016. People who spend more on certain things, like mortgage interest or hospital bills \u2014 or, in Mr. Trump\u2019s plan, child care bills \u2014 can itemize those expenses and claim a larger deduction.Mr. Trump\u2019s plan might increase the share of households that itemize because it would add a new category to the list of eligible expenses. But the bulk of the benefits almost certainly would accrue to wealthy families who spend the most money on child care, and who already incur other large deductible expenses.Kitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Goldman Sachs, Banker to the Elite, Turns to the Common Man", "Date": "2016-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreet SceneIt is not just coincidence that after 147 years of serving institutions and the ultra-wealthy, Goldman Sachs has decided that it will start catering to the common man: It is opportunism borne of necessity.The years since the financial crisis have not been particularly kind to Goldman Sachs\u2019s moneymaking machine \u2013 not that anyone is weeping for the company or the people who work there \u2014 despite an improving economy and record numbers of corporate financings and mergers and acquisitions. In the last three fiscal years, Goldman has made a cumulative pretax profit of about $33 billion. By contrast, JPMorgan Chase, the nation\u2019s biggest bank by assets, has had cumulative pretax profit of $87 billion, nearly three times more. In 2007, Goldman and JPMorgan were much more evenly matched when it came to profitability. Goldman made $17.6 billion in pretax profit in 2007; JPMorgan made nearly $23 billion.Of course, the two Wall Street behemoths have never been particularly comparable. JPMorgan has a huge retail banking presence, a huge credit card business and an enormous asset management business attached to an increasingly important investment bank. It also has 236,000 employees. Goldman has always been first and foremost an investment bank \u2014 the world\u2019s premiere \u2014 onto which it has tried with varying degrees of success to append, among other things, a wealth management business, an asset management business and a private equity business. It has 36,500 employees.That formula worked magnificently for Goldman for its first 138 years. But things have been much more of a struggle since 2008 for Goldman, thanks to regulators and lawmakers in Washington, who are intent on making sure that Wall Street never again takes the kinds of risks that turned into the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Washington wants Wall Street banks to become more like highly regulated utilities with profit capped. We can debate whether this is a good thing or a bad thing \u2014 personally, I am convinced that Washington\u2019s regulators have become arbitrary and capricious and are hurting Main Street by tying down Wall Street \u2014 but one thing is clear: The kind of clever risk-taking that Goldman specialized in \u2014 making big, and extremely profitable, bets with its own money \u2014 is outlawed for now (and probably for the foreseeable future).And here\u2019s why: In the zero-interest-rate environment that the Federal Reserve has carefully curated for eight years, Goldman and other banks can gather up money \u2014 the raw material they use to make more money \u2014 at virtually no cost. By opening an online bank, Goldman can gather up billions of dollars in consumer deposits without the cost of a physical branch and pay its customers close to nothing for their money. Goldman is offering to pay savers 1.05 percent annually. That may sound like close to zero, and it is, but the rate is also nearly 17 times more than the 0.06 percent annual interest rate that JPMorgan pays me on my savings account.Goldman\u2019s idea is to get people like me to move my money, of course. Sure, the 1.05 percent is a teaser rate, created to attract billions of dollars to Goldman\u2019s new venture. And it will no doubt work. Since April, GS Bank has collected $1.8 billion in deposits, essentially by word of mouth.Goldman will then take that raw material and use it to make more money, in large part by lending it out through its online lender Marcus, which aims at consumers looking to borrow around $20,000. Goldman will charge plenty more in interest for these loans than the 1 percent it is paying savers at GS Bank. Although its terms will not be known until Marcus rolls out officially in October, assume for the moment that the going rate for consumer loans of this nature \u2013 if both Lending Club and Prosper are useful guides \u2013 is around 12 percent. That difference \u2013 the 11 percentage points \u2013 is what Goldman will largely rake in as profit.Once upon a time, individuals needed a minimum of around $10 million in liquid assets, or cash, to be a client of Goldman Sachs\u2019s private bank. According to Quora, in the entire world, there are about one million people at that elite level of wealth. With Marcus and GS Bank, Goldman is hoping that millions more ordinary people will be a new source of riches. So if it floats your boat to be a client of Goldman Sachs, this is your big chance. Just remember that Goldman has never been, and will never be, a charitable organization.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fly-Fishing in Montana, Where a River Still Runs Through It", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cIn our family, there was no clear line between religion and fly fishing.\u201d That\u2019s how Norman Maclean began \u201cA River Runs Through It,\u201d his revered 1976 autobiographical novella about his life in Missoula, Mont., as the son of a Presbyterian minister and devout angler in the years before World War II.On a Sunday morning in June, on the Big Blackfoot River, it was not hard to see how the Macleans came by their faith. Although the family\u2019s home stream runs just outside of Missoula, a town of some 71,000, it remains remarkably unspoiled, tucked away from the surrounding hallmarks of civilization like a secret world.For most of its 75-mile length, from its source along the Continental Divide to its confluence with the Clark Fork River just east of town, the Big Blackfoot is lined with Ponderosa pine forest. No traffic-choked roads run along it. No bars or restaurants abut it. You\u2019ll find none of the gaudy riverfront mansions that have given rise to the term \u201ctwo by four by 10\u201d in towns throughout the modern American West. (That\u2019s two people, four weeks a year, and 10,000 square feet.) There are bigger rivers and rivers that hold larger fish, but few offer anglers a more appealing mix of boulder-dotted rapids, shallow rocky-bottomed flats, and swirling deep green pools, and almost none are prettier.On my first cast, I got a strike but set the hook too slowly and missed the fish. But just a few casts later, I watched my fly alight and begin drifting downstream. In a moment, a fish rose from the depths, raced to the \u2019hopper and took it. When I brought it to the net, I saw it was a gorgeous, copper-colored Westslope cutthroat trout, one of just a few species native to the Big Blackfoot.After I released my catch, Mr. Herzer and I paused for a moment to appreciate our good fortune. In less than five minutes, we had landed a fish of almost startling beauty in a setting no less lovely. I am not a religious person, but I\u2019ll be damned if I didn\u2019t feel something holy.I was among the inspired. As a boy in upstate New York, I had fished with spinning tackle on local ponds and lakes, but when I saw the movie, fly-fishing struck me as something richer and more complex than conventional fishing, as much an art form as a sport. It had an ineffable appeal, too, something existential, Emersonian.Reading Maclean\u2019s book only sunk the hook deeper. It wasn\u2019t just the fishing. If there is a smarter, more affecting meditation on the themes of fathers and sons, brothers, the pleasures of the natural world, love, loss and the haunting power of water, I have yet to come across it. As it has for many others, \u201cA River Runs Through It\u201d became for me a kind of central text, equal parts fishing primer, literary masterwork and spiritual guide.I went on to become an editor, writer and avid reader, and it remains one of my most beloved books. I also took up fly-fishing with an almost obsessive passion, wetting a line everywhere from Wyoming and Idaho to the Bahamas and Belize. And yet, almost 25 years later, I had not traveled to the Big Blackfoot. It was time to see what had caused all the fuss.\u201cA River Runs Through It\u201d centers on Maclean\u2019s relationship with his younger brother, Paul. Norman is the archetypal older sibling, married, hard-working and responsible. Paul is the golden child, handsome, athletic and charming, but with a weakness for whiskey and high-stakes poker games. Paul is also a superior, almost superhuman, fisherman.Much of the book plumbs Norman\u2019s love for Paul (and envy of him) as an angler and otherwise. But the story is also a tragedy involving Paul\u2019s untimely death \u2014 he was fatally beaten over unpaid gambling debts \u2014 and the regret Norman feels that he could not help save him. The book is told in hindsight, when Maclean is a much older man, a point of view that lends everything a deep nostalgic ache.Maclean structured the work around four fishing scenes, three of which are set on the Big Blackfoot. Over two days, Mr. Herzer and I fished all three of those spots: the canyon above Clearwater Bridge, a beach downstream from that, and the mouth of Belmont Creek.\u201cThe canyon above the old Clearwater Bridge is where the Blackfoot roars loudest,\u201d Maclean wrote. It is here that he first limns the almost heavenly beauty of fly-fishing and Paul\u2019s nearly godlike gift for it. Watching Paul cast \u201ca four-and-a-half-ounce magic totem pole,\u201d the water droplets left in the wake of his line \u201cmade momentary loops of gossamer,\u201d Maclean wrote. \u201cThe canyon was glorified by rhythms and colors.\u201dI had a rapturous experience in the canyon myself. The old bridge has an early 20th-century feel to it that seems to bring one back to Maclean\u2019s time, and the surrounding water and wilderness are idyllic. After a period of neglect during the \u201970s and \u201980s, the Big Blackfoot has been thoughtfully managed by a consortium of public and private interests. It isn\u2019t what it was when Maclean fished it (there were more fish then, and the area was less populated and more remote), and probably never will be again, but at a time when many rivers have been badly degraded, it is relatively pristine, nowhere more so than in the canyon. It is a heartening, even inspiring, success story.Just above the bridge, Mr. Herzer suggested I fish a fly called a Sparkle Minnow (generally speaking, anglers try to pick flies that match what the fish are eating on that particular piece of water at that particular time). Within minutes, I landed a stout 18-inch brown trout with signature black and red markings.In the book, Maclean makes a point of noting that his father was unusual among Presbyterian ministers in his use of the word \u201cbeautiful.\u201d It\u2019s partly a crack about Presbyterian ministers but also a detail that gives the word special weight. That morning, we went on to land about a dozen fish altogether. Every one of them was, by any definition, beautiful.Around 1 o\u2019clock, Mr. Herzer and I anchored on a shady bank under a high canyon wall where he laid out a spread of Italian roast beef sandwiches and potato chips and a pile of fresh, local cherries gathered from a friend\u2019s backyard. Our only company was a bald eagle tracing circles above us.You can\u2019t talk about \u201cA River Runs Through It\u201d without talking about the sunburn scene, one of the most indelible moments in the book, and certainly the funniest. Maclean\u2019s brother-in-law, Neal, a dandy (and worse, a bait fisherman) visits Missoula from Los Angeles. But instead of fishing with Norman and Paul, as intended, he mostly gets drunk and enlists the services of a local prostitute known as Old Rawhide. On one outing, Norman and Paul wind up ditching Neal and Old Rawhide, only to come upon them later, passed out on a sand bar, unclothed and sunburned, their naked posteriors facing skyward.On my trip, the area in question produced an altogether more welcome sight: a beautiful gray-green bull trout with salmon-colored spots, measuring some 21 inches. (Because \u201cbullies\u201d are a protected species, anglers are prohibited from targeting them, but it\u2019s acceptable to catch them if you do so while fishing for other species. The Big Blackfoot is primarily a catch-and-release river, in any case.)The alpha fish of the Big Blackfoot, bull trout are brawny, aggressive and almost prehistoric-looking. They seem to connect you, as fishing often does, to something primal. It was also the first bull trout I\u2019d ever caught. To an angler, landing a new species is a special thrill, like traveling to an exotic new country or tasting a delicious new food.After dinner I walked along the Clark Fork River and across a bridge to Maclean\u2019s boyhood home, a modest Craftsman with a wide front porch and white picket fence. I have been accused of being as unsentimental as a Presbyterian minister myself, and I am here to report that I did not mist up (mostly). Neither did I ring the doorbell or take a picture. I didn\u2019t do anything, really. What happened was I found myself pantomiming a casting stroke. It was entirely involuntary, but I think of it now as a tribute to Maclean.The book\u2019s climactic scene takes place near the Big Blackfoot\u2019s confluence with Belmont Creek. At Paul\u2019s suggestion, he and Norman spend the night at their parents\u2019 home so the two brothers and their father, who is retired now, can wake up and fish together the next day. The bite is on, and Norman is filled with joy. \u201cSo on this wonderful afternoon when all things came together it took me one cast, one fish ... to attain perfection. I did not miss another.\u201dSoon, Paul is hauling them in, too, and his artistry is such that Norman and their father stop to watch him. On the hunt for his 20th and final fish, Paul hooks a big rainbow trout, fights it brilliantly, and lands it.\u201c \u2018That\u2019s his limit,\u2019 I said to my father,\u201d Maclean wrote.\u201c \u2018He is beautiful,\u2019 my father said.\u201dThen, \u201cThis was the last fish we were ever to see Paul catch.\u201dThe book\u2019s final two paragraphs are a lyrical, almost mystical reflection that many anglers know by heart:\u201cEventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it. The river was cut by the world\u2019s great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time. On some of the rocks are timeless raindrops. Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs.\u201cI am haunted by waters.\u201dJust above the mouth of Belmont Creek, I hooked a rainbow of my own whose eponymous colors flashed in the sunlight. Shortly before I had left for Montana, the Orlando mass shooting had taken place. The day before my departure, Britain had voted to leave the European Union, threatening the global economy. A family member had recently received a serious medical diagnosis. But at that moment on the Big Blackfoot River, all that existed were the sun and the water and a fish on the other end of my line. \u201cOne great thing about fly fishing,\u201d Maclean wrote, \u201cis that after a while nothing exists of the world but thoughts about fly fishing.\u201dIt pains the cynic in me to say so, but my trip was more magical than haunting. The river was as pretty and well-preserved as I could have dreamed for it to be. I caught fish, memorable ones, in the most storied spots from the book. I communed with one of my literary and fishing heroes.I held the rainbow for a beat, then another, and released him.Direct flights to Missoula, Mont., are available from major cities including Chicago, Minneapolis, Salt Lake City, Denver and Seattle.

{"Headline": "Bay Area Start-Ups Find Low-Cost Outposts in Arizona", "Date": "2016-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPHOENIX \u2014 Three years ago, Kate Rogers was caught in the Bay Area struggle. She paid the astronomical rents. She did the crushing commute. She lived the frustration of always thinking about money even though she was a well-paid professional in the booming technology industry.And then, just like that, the stress went away. All she had to do was move to Arizona.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to have to decide between picking my son up at school and being successful at my job,\u201d said Ms. Rogers, who runs the Phoenix-area offices of Weebly, a San Francisco company whose software makes it easier for regular people to build websites. \u201cIn San Francisco, that would not have been possible.\u201dAs start-ups across San Francisco and the Silicon Valley try to contend with high salaries and housing costs, many are expanding to lower-cost cities in the West and employing more people like Ms. Rogers. For Phoenix, which is about a 90-minute flight from San Francisco, the Bay Area\u2019s loss is its gain.At the end of last year in the Bay Area mega-region \u2014 including both the San Francisco and San Jose metropolitan areas \u2014 there were 530,000 tech and engineering jobs, a 7 percent increase from a year earlier. Phoenix has about one-fifth as many tech jobs, but the total grew 8 percent from a year ago, according to Moody\u2019s Analytics.\u201cThe Bay Area\u2019s explosive growth is almost too much for the region,\u201d said Jackson Kitchen, an analyst at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cThey are bidding up wages so high that companies are saying, \u2018Let\u2019s expand to Phoenix or Boise or Salt Lake City where wages and real estate are that much cheaper.\u2019\u201dIndirectly, of course, this is also good for the Bay Area\u2019s tech cluster, allowing companies to grow faster and make jobs more appealing. By expanding to Arizona, for example, Weebly was able to turn freelance customer service representatives into full-time employees.The company\u2019s Scottsdale, Ariz., office has Silicon Valley perks like catered lunches and a massage room, along with some local touches, like a \u201cNo Weapons\u201d sign to remind employees that open-carry laws do not extend onto company property.Wages, taxes and energy cost about 25 percent less in Phoenix than they do in San Francisco, according to an index of business costs compiled by Moody\u2019s Analytics.Housing is much cheaper. The median home price in the Phoenix metropolitan area is $221,000, according to Zillow. In San Francisco, it is $812,000.For Ms. Rogers and others, that is a far bigger perk than an extra vacation or a raise in California. Instead of renting a rundown house in Redwood City and commuting an hour or more to work, she now lives 10 minutes from the office in a house that is twice the size \u2014 with mortgage payments that are half the cost of her California rent.\u201cWhen I had a kid, it forced the decision for me,\u201d Ms. Rogers said.Hordes of young dreamy entrepreneurs still flock to the Bay Area each year in search of venture capital. Silicon Valley is to tech entrepreneurs what Hollywood is to actors, and the region continues to significantly outpace the nation in creating engineering jobs.But as companies grow and add large numbers of sales and customer service jobs, \u201cit\u2019s less about survival and having everybody in the same room,\u201d said Lawrence Coburn, chief executive of DoubleDutch, a San Francisco maker of software for live events that recently laid off a quarter of its staff to try to become profitable sooner.This year, the company opened a downtown Phoenix office with sales and customer service jobs. \u201cSan Francisco is a terrible place for entry-level people,\u201d Mr. Coburn said, because the infrastructure and housing are \u201cfailing.\u201dLocal economic development agencies and real estate developers are doing what they can to keep the movement going. Take, for instance, the downtown Phoenix offices of Gainsight, a Redwood City company whose software helps companies track and retain customers. In November, Gainsight opened its 12-person Phoenix office, with modernist touches like exposed ceilings and concrete floors in the hallways, along with the crammed desks and open floor plan favored by tech companies.The only private spaces are a handful of conference rooms, including one that has a Ping-Pong table and is decorated with posters with famous quotes by luminaries including Mother Teresa.Most of the building\u2019s floors have a more traditional layout full of offices and carpet. But the building\u2019s owner, Ironline Partners, renovated the more open floor with an eye toward software companies, of which there are now three, including Gainsight.\u201cSince those guys moved in, we\u2019ve blown out the entire 15th floor and the entire fifth floor to do more of the same,\u201d said D. J. Fernandes, an architect at Ironline Partners who designed the spaces.The Bay Area has never been especially cheap, and tech companies have a long history of moving their more expensive and labor-intensive functions to second-tier cities where land and labor are less expensive. Intel, the semiconductor giant, was founded in the Silicon Valley in 1968, and by 1979, it had manufacturing facilities outside Portland, Ore., and Phoenix.But as the latest exodus gathers steam, these outlying cities hope some of the higher-paying engineering jobs will start moving as well.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be San Francisco\u2019s back office \u2014 we need more creators here,\u201d said Scott Salkin, a founder and the chief executive of Allbound, which is based in Phoenix, makes sales software and has offices down the hall from Gainsight\u2019s.Chris Camacho, chief executive of the Greater Phoenix Economic Council, says better-paying jobs will follow, since companies prefer to expand in cities where they already have offices. That has been true for Intel, which over the last few decades has added a number of different positions to its original manufacturing hubs.This is why part of Mr. Camacho\u2019s strategy is to focus on Bay Area start-ups just as they reach a growth spurt. \u201cThe reality is all of these companies are going to hit a pain point once they hit more than 50 employees,\u201d he said.But while Phoenix is recruiting companies, its technology scene lacks some crucial elements. Mr. Salkin, from Allbound, said he still flies to the Bay Area once a month for networking or other events. \u201cWe\u2019re doing amazing things here,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we\u2019ve got a way to go.\u201dMr. Salkin added that for technology companies, which hire people from all kinds of backgrounds, Arizona\u2019s socially conservative politics can be a form of cultural baggage. For example, the former governor, Jan Brewer, signed one of the nation\u2019s toughest immigration laws in 2010, and same-sex marriage was illegal until a federal court overturned a voter-approved ban in 2014.In San Francisco, \u201cyou can come from any walk of life and feel pretty much accepted and safe,\u201d Mr. Salkin said. \u201cYou struggle to say that here right now. I think that\u2019s changing, but it has not been the case in Arizona, and I think that\u2019s a big thing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Now, a United Nations of languages babble from the hot sidewalks and the burning beaches while hedge fund managers look on from the comfort of their yachts.In 2015, Provence, which includes the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, was the most popular French region among international buyers, accounting for 22 percent of all sales, according to the website French-Property.com. At the same time, the British real estate company Knight Frank reported that residential sales across France had increased 12.5 percent from 2014 to 2015 and the company welcomed a more stable economic outlook, which was reflected in the doubling of its own sales.But that was then. Since those optimistic days, Europe and much of the world has been shaken by \u201cBrexit,\u201d the British decision to leave the European Union, and it is impossible to discuss any subject, let alone property in Provence, without acknowledging the terrorist attack on Nice in July in which 85 people were killed.Laurence Chaleil, the general manager of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty in Cannes, 21 miles along the coast from Nice, faces both those issues unflinchingly. When we first met, before the attack, she mentioned the decline in the number of American buyers, who were deterred from investing by their fear of terrorism, making the point that more people are killed by guns in the United States than in Europe (13,467 in the United States in 2015, according to Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit website; and about 6,700 a year in the European Union, says the Flemish Peace Institute, an independent research group).Now she acknowledges: \u201cThe attack in Nice will surely lead to some immediate negative consequences on local tourism. Terrorism always has this temporary effect. Nevertheless, we cannot forecast a lasting decrease on the market. We hope not.\u201dAnd Brexit? \u201cThe vote is too recent to seriously appreciate the impact it could have on the Riviera real estate market,\u201d Mrs. Chaleil said. \u201cThe exit will last several years. Currently we believe that Brexit should have a positive effect, because people will spend less in the U.K. and switch to the European Union countries, and the Riviera, instead. \u201dSo, this could still be a good time to buy. For those who want to be in the thick of the action, a penthouse on La Croisette, the boulevard that follows the Cannes shoreline for more than one mile, is for sale at \u20ac7.5 million or nearly $8.5 million, with Property Europe Online. Recently renovated, in 60 square meters, or 650 square feet, it contains five rooms and three bedrooms and has a wide terrace with views to the yachts in the bay and the mountains behind.Mrs. Chaleil takes us further up-market with her selection of villas, condos and castles, most of which are at the \u20ac10 million mark. Or more.The recently restored red brick Ch\u00e2teau Soligny at Cannes is all crenellations and arched windows overlooking the Mediterranean, and, with nine bedrooms, nine baths, a home movie theater and a wine cellar, it has an asking price in the range of \u20ac55 million and \u20ac60 million. The shoreside Palais Maeterlinck in Nice, a monolithic former hotel, is being converted into 18 residences \u201c\u2018without equal in Europe,\u201d as the brochure has it, with the option of having a home styled by Ralph Lauren Home. Prices range from \u20ac2.9 million to \u20ac11.9 million.Set in lawns under parasol pines and towering cypresses, from the front it appears as a stately, Florentine-style mansion, while at the rear, Palladian columns add an improbable grandeur. The showstopper is the view from the steps over the pool, which seems to disappear into space and merge with the blue sea in the distance. Inside is a hallway in white stone, so big and so formal that one half expects to be welcomed by a butler with a tray of martinis. But behind the scenes the kitchen needs updating, as do the huge bedrooms and marbled bathrooms, which are lined with wall-to-wall mirrors.It all feels like the kind of place a clich\u00e9d Russian oligarch would pay too much for \u2014 except that the Russians aren\u2019t coming. Two million are said to have been forbidden by their government to spend overseas because of their personal debts, a number that is rising in part because of the country\u2019s faltering economy.\u201cThe Russians had inflated the prices before,\u201d said Mrs. Chaleil, whose office door has signs in Russian, as well as French. \u201cNow prices are dropping to a more realistic level and are even more attractive because of the very low interest rates of about 1 to 1.5 percent. Nearly half our clients are coming from France compared with 10 percent before, though they tend to go for smaller places at lower prices.\u201dMaybe they should head inland, where a succession of delightful villages, little-known spots such as such as Seillans, Fayence and popular destinations like St. Paul de Vence, perch prettily on hilltops. You could find a substantial four-bedroom villa with a pool in any one of them for less than \u20ac1 million, but few are more enticing than a villa in Tourrettes sur Loup, a few kilometers from St. Paul de Vence.It is owned by Francine Farkas Sears, an American entrepreneur, and she has brought her sound good taste to improvements to the villa: an opulent master bedroom suite with its own terrace and bathroom with Jacuzzi, four other bedrooms and bathrooms, and a living space that meanders from open-air cooking area into a kitchen fit for a master chef.There are also indoor and outdoor dining areas, and elegant living rooms in stone and terra-cotta, all linked with arches that open on to the pool and the garden. The sale, which is being handled by Alexandra Connolly, a local agent, is valued between \u20ac5 million and \u20ac6 million.And then there is the view: priceless. From the terrace, you look over a precipitous wooded valley owned by the queen of Denmark \u2014 so no threat of development \u2014 and across the dark undulations of the hills there is Cannes and the Mediterranean. \u201cIt\u2019s not real,\u201d joked Mrs. Farkas Sears. \u201cThis is really wallpaper. It\u2019s a painting.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Innovation Campus: Building Better Ideas", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhere once the campus amenities arms race was waged over luxury dorms and recreation facilities, now colleges and universities are building deluxe structures for the generation of wonderful ideas. They and their partners in industry are pouring millions into new buildings for business, engineering and applied learning that closely resemble the high-tech workplace, itself inspired by the minimally partitioned spaces of the garage and the factory.What architects take from Building 20 is not its ramshackle aesthetic \u2014 though some believe less polish provides more freedom \u2014 but the importance of mixing disciplines, of work performed out in the open, and of transition zones like hallways and staircases as sites for productive run-ins.Though studies have shown that proximity and conversation can produce creative ideas, there\u2019s little research on the designs needed to facilitate the process. Still, there are commonalities.Staircases and halls are wide and often daylit, encouraging people to dwell between their appointments in hopes of having a creative collision. Exposure to natural light itself contributes to improved workplace performance. There\u2019s also much more to do with your hands than take notes in class: The need to move your body, by working on a prototype, taking the stairs or going in search of caffeine at a centralized cafe, is built in, providing breaks to let the mind wander.The rationales for these buildings are varied: Employers are dissatisfied with graduates\u2019 preparation, students are unhappy with outdated teaching methods, and colleges want to attract students whose eyes are on postgrad venture capital and whose scalable ideas might come in handy on campus. And so universities of all sizes, both public (Wichita State, University of Utah, University of Iowa) and private (Cornell, Northwestern, Stanford), have opened or are planning such facilities.The studio is in the Bloomberg Center, named to acknowledge a $100 million gift from Bloomberg Philanthropies, matching New York City\u2019s contribution toward the total cost for phase one, which is estimated at $800 million. A sculptural staircase, jutting provocatively from the side of the building, was designed to encourage students and faculty members to take the stairs to their work space instead of the shorter elevator route between front door and desk. So much of contemporary design for innovation involves adding friction to people\u2019s work lives, as unexpected encounters (with people, with different spaces, with art) are supposed to lead to unexpected ideas.\u201cBeing in bigger interactive spaces encourages expansive thinking, while being in a box of a room encourages box thinking,\u201d said Dan Huttenlocher, founding dean and vice provost at Cornell Tech. \u201cSometimes you need to be in a box to concentrate, but to always sit in a little box is a problem.\u201dNo one has a private office at the Bloomberg Center, the primary academic building, and opaque walls are few. The only spaces faculty members can truly call their own are lockable storage cabinets, with carts for equipment. Traditional classrooms, too, are few \u2014 the Cornell Tech curriculum privileges projects over lectures. Instead, there will be options so that people can choose how they like to work, from open-plan spaces by the windows, to a roof deck with a garden, to huddle rooms for groups of five or less.\u201cAs you begin to understand how people work together, there is an ideal size of collaboration,\u201d said Ung-Joo Scott Lee, principal at Morphosis, the architects. \u201cBeyond five people it is too much of a crowd.\u201dIf this sounds like Silicon Valley, it should. \u201cWe looked at Pixar in Emeryville very carefully, along with Bloomberg L.P. and Google, who have sizable office space in New York and understand the constraints of the urban environment,\u201d Mr. Huttenlocher said. (Until it moves onto its own campus, Cornell Tech is headquartered in the Google building in Chelsea \u2014 every designer working for a university, it seems, has taken a swing through Mountain View.)\u201cPixar had to bring together very different cultures and get them to work as one, the creative and the business side, but also creative and tech people,\u201d Mr. Huttenlocher said.to this live-work building, anticipating the early lifestyle of dot-com employees, whose living quarters usually resemble walk-in closets. The Utah version is more plush, however: Residents, who can be graduate or undergraduate and in any major, can choose pods (cubbylike rooms with built-in bed, desk, storage and TV), lofts in an industrial vernacular (beds in a communal setting with shared kitchen, lounge and bathrooms) or more traditional single or double rooms.Different floors have different themes, based on Utah\u2019s existing strengths: one for games and digital media, one for adventure and gear, one for design and the arts, one for global impact and sustainability. The ground-floor \u201cgarage\u201d has workshops equipped with 3-D printers, laser cutters and other prototyping tools, available to anyone at the university and staffed by work-study students. All the programs offered by the Lassonde Entrepreneurship Institute, the division that is building the studios, are extracurricular and interdisciplinary; a few degrees are offered in partnership with the business school.\u201cOne thing about the building is it has no formal classrooms, and no faculty or staff offices,\u201d said Troy D\u2019Ambrosio, executive director of the institute. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to have a classroom because that says, \u2018In this room you learn, out here you don\u2019t learn.\u2019\u201dInnovation buildings tend to be affiliated with schools of business or engineering, but there is a strong arts presence within them. Lassonde Studios, designed by Yazdani Studio of Cannon Design, hopes to attract students from industrial design, the fine arts and communications. \u201cWe have made an effort to say, \u2018Entrepreneurs create new things, and you do that too,\u2019\u201d Mr. D\u2019Ambrosio said.A thousand students applied for the 400 beds this fall, and 37 percent of the chosen are women. \u201cIt\u2019s important to have a critical mass of women involved so women will come in,\u201d he said. \u201cEngineering is very heavily male, the business school is more male than female, but we are getting applicants from the fine arts, humanities and health sciences. Students have 35 to 40 different majors, and that happened pretty organically.\u201dThe studios are named after a Canadian businessman, Pierre Lassonde, who gave the initial $7 million for the building (he and his late wife, Claudette MacKay-Lassonde, are Utah alumni). The bulk of the $45 million construction costs were funded by a revenue bond, to be paid back with \u201crents\u201d from students. The experience will cost. A double goes for $6,830 for the academic year, a three-person loft for $9,135. Elsewhere on campus: $4,874 for a double, $4,367 for a triple deluxe.The radical restructuring of both curriculum and architecture are supposed to contribute to greater parity. Gone is a first year of large lecture courses on basic science. Instead, students work alone or in small groups on a \u201cpassion project.\u201d \u201cIf you are working on an efficient filtering system for water in Ethiopia, you will need to know more about mathematics, about partial differential equations,\u201d Dr. Kozinski said. \u201cThey would come to us, and then we would gently start introducing mathematics. Learning by doing and learning in social spaces with professors is reflected in the design.\u201dInformal lounges are threaded throughout the building, from a generous one at entry level to small banquettes in the wide hallways. Active learning classrooms (there are no lecture halls) combine different sizes and heights of tables and chairs, and are equipped with projectors and I.T.-integrated furniture from Steelcase. The \u201cSandbox\u201d space, which includes collaboration-size rooms and a 3-D prototyping lab, gives students the option to brainstorm on their own or work with classmates. The architects specified some furniture with built-in scribble pads, and many of the walls are writable back-painted glass.\u201cWe equate it to a design lab like in architecture school, a place where you can go brainstorm, sketch on the scribble pads, work with classmates,\u201d Paul Stevens, a senior principal at ZAS, said. \u201cOr you can take your sketches and use hand tools to start making a sample.\u201d Tool cribs hold smaller materials for experiential learning. Larger, purpose-built labs are equipped with professional-grade equipment for testing and prototyping, including a concrete-lined mechanical lab with a 12-ton crane. \u201cThis is where you get to build things like solar cars, or crush concrete,\u201d he said.Once students have their model, they can pitch it to industry leaders in a dressed-up lounge intended as a bridge space between students and the wider world. It was important, Mr. Stevens said, that it resemble a corporate lounge \u2014 \u201ca beautiful, high-end-finish space\u201d \u2014 rather than an intimidating board room, and the school made it a priority to have best-in-class furniture, including Eames chairs, to set the tone.The Garage provides cafe, meeting, classroom and workshop space for anyone on campus \u2014 a student center with an entrepreneurial purpose, with amenities like 3-D printers, Bluescape interactive screens and design software. Programs focus on helping students develop ideas and finding them mentors. Melissa Crounse, the executive director of the Garage and a former Google employee, holds weekly dinners for alumni and students, asking the successful (one assumes) alumni to tell a story about a previous failure.Gensler began the design process by diagraming the paths of potential users, from visiting entrepreneurs giving a lecture to a student prototyping a project through sewing, 3-D printing or laser cutting. By overlaying those paths they saw \u201chot spots\u201d where students, faculty members and guests might naturally congregate, like areas around whiteboards on conference room doors.\u201cIf you keep the schedule on the outside of the conference room, the act of signing up in an analog way causes a lot of discussions,\u201d Mr. Heiser said. \u201cMaybe meetings tie together. You need to create experiences that heighten the potential interaction.\u201dArt schools have always had open plans, daylit work spaces and power tools. But the new arts building also has many elements of the STEM-focused innovation campus in hopes of facilitating the mixing of disciplines and modes of instruction.Iowa\u2019s building attempts to embody that idea by placing itself along a primary pedestrian route, so seeing new work is unavoidable. The curriculum, too, draws in majors from across the university, with popular classes that include building your own bicycle.\u201cEngineering majors are often impressed by art students\u2019 relative high level of tool knowledge,\u201d Mr. McGuire said. \u201cThey see their experiences in various studios, from the suite of CNC equipment to traditional fabrication, complementing and enhancing theoretical knowledge they\u2019ve learned in engineering courses.\u201dSet near the university\u2019s museums, the building, like Iowa\u2019s, is positioned as a campus crossroad. People from other disciplines may literally be stopped in their tracks by what\u2019s going on in the transparent ground-floor galleries and workshops, or be drawn inside by a glimpse of people studying in the treehouselike reading room.Here, classes that combine art and science and art and technology include \u201cDrawing With Code\u201d and, most appropriately, \u201cData as Material,\u201d which delves into the history of using information to create art.\u201cWe reached out to the local business community and asked what they wanted in a graduate, and they told us there was a two-year gap between a graduate and someone who is a productive worker,\u201d said Emily Patterson, associate director of facilities planning at Wichita State. \u201cThey were asking for a more prepared student.\u201dSo in the $25 million Experiential Engineering Building, set to open for classes in January, students will be able to do hands-on and applied learning in 25 specialized science and engineering labs; engineering hub rooms will be open 24/7. A separate makerspace with evening hours, run by GoCreate, will offer facilities for metalworking, woodworking, textiles and digital creation to students and local residents. Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, a software company, is planning a 3-D immersive lab, and a few other spaces have been set aside for local businesses.Today\u2019s innovation campuses tend to make their pipeline to the real world explicit. Airbus Americas is moving its engineering center, and 400 Wichita employees, to a new structure on the campus, to be built on ground leased from the university. The center will also have room for up to 100 student workers. In another partnership, a law enforcement training center, with construction costs paid by the city and county, will serve the police departments as well as Wichita State\u2019s criminal justice students.Kansas public education has experienced state cutbacks at every level in recent months. Wichita State, along with other Kansas universities, has increased tuition 5 percent to make up for the budget cuts. \u201cState funding is dwindling, so we have to be innovative in our financing,\u201d Ms. Patterson said. Construction has gone forward on the Innovation Campus because the Experiential Engineering Building, designed by Perkins + Will and WDM Architects, is financed via grants to Kansas universities to produce more engineering graduates in a state where aviation and energy are top industries.How successful will Wichita State and other universities be at fueling innovation and, ultimately, a new entrepreneurship economy? The proof may be many years out, and difficult to quantify. But the pressure on administrators to change their campuses may soon come, not just from above and within, but from below.An anecdote from Kevin B. Sullivan of Payette, whose firm has interdisciplinary science and engineering centers under construction at Northeastern and Tufts, underscores the urgency. \u201cI\u2019m on the board of my daughter\u2019s high school, and what they are doing there is taking the existing library, gutting it and turning it into a tech-enablement space,\u201d he said. \u201cThe college process may be dumbed down from what they do in high school.\u201dAlexandra Lange is the architecture critic for Curbed and the author of \u201cWriting About Architecture: Mastering the Language of Buildings and Cities.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The bombings occurred as people prepared to celebrate the birthday of Queen Sirikit on Friday, which is considered Mother\u2019s Day in Thailand.

The police there detained two men for questioning on Friday in connection with the attacks, Reuters reported.The military-drafted Constitution will diminish the influence of political parties and give greater power to the military even after it returns the government to civilian control.

{"Headline": "A Start-Up Turns to Saffron to Help Afghanistan Regrow", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBomb-blasted roads, frequent blackouts, shortages of basic equipment and an untested consumer market are hardly conditions that make for natural entrepreneurial opportunities.Their business is part of a small crop of efforts to help develop Afghanistan\u2019s resource economy.\u201cWe wanted to create something to empower everyday Afghans long after we left,\u201d said Kimberly Jung, one of Rumi Spice\u2019s founders, who said the company\u2019s name was inspired by the 13th-century Persian poet.Saffron is one of the most expensive spices in the world, costing $2,500 to $30,000 a kilogram. A staple in Indian, Moroccan and Persian cuisine, it is also a crucial ingredient in European dishes like Spanish paella and French bouillabaisse.As Americans search out the latest artisanal trends, Afghan saffron is starting to make inroads.The Rumi Spice founders decided to focus on farmers because 80 percent of the Afghan population works in agriculture, according to the United States Embassy in Kabul.Still, starting a business, even a small one, is filled with challenges in Afghanistan. Much business is done based on trust or relationships rather than contracts or agreements. In their case, the founders discovered that some of the contacts they made during their military deployments were receptive to working with them.In addition, electricity blackouts are common, which can render the dryers used in processing useless. The main national highway is both damaged by war and still a prime target of improvised explosive devices, or I.E.D.s, making travel risky.Saffron is expensive because it is difficult to grow and painstaking to harvest. Each amethyst-colored saffron crocus produces just three stigmas. The stigmas are separated by hand from the blossom and then dried into rusty-red threads.About 150 flowers are needed to produce a single gram of saffron. Afghan saffron has a reputation for being particularly flavorful \u2014 in part because of the terrain and harsh climate around Herat, where it is grown.In 2014, Keith Alaniz, an Army engineer officer who worked with regional governments in Afghanistan, approached his friend Ms. Jung, whom he had met while working for the Army Corps of Engineers after Hurricane Sandy in New York, about the idea of marketing Afghan saffron.Ms. Jung had been an Army engineer officer who searched for roadside bombs in Afghanistan. She was then at Harvard Business School with Emily Miller, also a former Army engineer officer, who had assisted Special Operations on night raids.The company\u2019s fourth founder, Carol Wang, had worked in Afghanistan on a World Bank-backed rural development program.The farmers were skeptical at first, Ms. Jung said, because they had seen \u201cpeople come and go with many promises.\u201dBut Ms. Miller said, \u201cOnce they started seeing we could really sell the product, the farmers started knocking on our doors.\u201dRumi Spice worked with 34 farmers in 2015. The company plans to work with more than 80 farmers for this year\u2019s harvest in October and November.The processing plant, based in Herat, employed 75 Afghan women in 2015. The company paid their wages directly to them rather than following the more common Afghan practice of paying the male head of the household. About 300 to 400 women will be hired for the 2016 harvest.Rumi Spice was initially set up as a limited liability company. A year later, the founders switched it to a public benefit corporation. They were drawn by the idea that the company would be \u201crequired by law to report profit and impact every two years\u201d to shareholders, Ms. Miller said.In 2016, Rumi Spice is on track to reach its projected revenue of $500,000 for the year. The founders say that it became profitable three months ago.Two of the founders, Ms. Jung and Ms. Miller, are full time and based in the United States, while the other two work with them part time. The company also has two additional full-time employees based in Chicago and Afghanistan.Rumi Spice has hired locals to help provide security for the operations in Afghanistan.Abdul Shakoor Ehrarri, an agricultural specialist, manages the saffron processing plant. He also meets with new farmers and helps recruit female employees by going for tea with their husbands, fathers or brothers to assure them that they will be safe in the workplace.It also helps that Herat, the saffron region where the plant is based, is one of the most stable in Afghanistan.Beyond security, the Rumi Spice team says that another challenge is educating American consumers about saffron. \u201cThe average consumer is very skeptical of anything from Afghanistan,\u201d Ms. Miller said.Chefs, however, have been receptive. Many already used high-quality saffron and were curious to try the Afghan variety.In 2015, soon after Ms. Jung returned from a trip to Afghanistan, she took some saffron to the New York chef Daniel Boulud.\u201cI was very pleased by the high quality and the purity of the pistils of Rumi Spice saffron, and the taste was exceptional as well,\u201d said Mr. Boulud, who has been using Rumi Spice saffron in his signature restaurant, Daniel, for over six months. \u201cIt immediately appealed to us to aid the veterans and help the economy in Afghanistan.\u201dFamilyFarmed has helped Rumi Spice refine its brand. \u201cInitially they were helping Afghan farmers by paying a premium price for saffron and displacing opium production,\u201d said Jim Slama, the president of FamilyFarmed. \u201cWe helped them simplify their story. Now they are an ethical luxury brand.\u201dRumi Spice is also exploring new channels to reach customers, such as meal delivery services. \u201cWe are also looking into super-edgy product development,\u201d Ms. Miller said, such as \u201cpremium saffron butter that could go with a fresh Maine lobster.\u201dBut more than the business aspect, Ms. Jung said that the connection to Afghan people has been the highlight of the venture.She remembers a special moment during the saffron harvest last fall. At one point, the younger women working in the new processing plant, some of them teenagers, shyly asked Ms. Jung to play Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s song \u201cIrreplaceable\u201d on her phone.They shut the door, held an impromptu dance party \u2014 and then returned to the time-consuming task of separating the fiery red stigmas from the purple saffron blossoms.Quoting an Afghan saying, Ms. Jung said, \u201cDrop by drop a river is made.\u201dAdvertisement"}

An American bartender in a new lounge with blond wood furniture mixes a cocktail called the Cloudy Nomad (barley wine and honey).This year, the camp also opened a yoga center that doubles as a communal dining hall. A sauna sits nearby.\u201cIn the high-end market, it\u2019s difficult to get heard out there and reach the right people,\u201d said Dechen Yeshi, 34, who runs the camp with her husband, Yidam Kyap, also 34. \u201cWe had to ask ourselves the question: What is luxury?\u201dThe camp was built at more than 10,000 feet in a clearing of yellow wildflowers near Yidam\u2019s ancestral home, in the region that Tibetans call Amdo. \u201cIt was so challenging to set this thing up here in the middle of nowhere,\u201d Dechen said. (Tibetans prefer to be known by their given name.)The camp and a carpet workshop in the area\u2019s main town, Xiahe, are the newest pieces of an ambitious social enterprise started by the Yeshi family, which has a mother-daughter team at its heart.The textiles are made of yak wool and are sold in New York, Paris and other Western cities, as well as online. A shop at the camp has products on display: shimmering blue shawls and smooth scarves and pillowcases with white cross icons, a traditional design on some Tibetan cloths.I arrived at the camp, coincidentally, on the same weekend in July as an acquaintance from Beijing, Hung Huang, a fashion and publishing entrepreneur. She had come to stay three nights with her young daughter and friends, among them design teachers from Guangzhou. She has posted a stream of photos from the camp on Instagram.\u201cI miss it so much,\u201d she wrote.On another day, two red-robed Tibetan monks who once lived at Labrang checked in with several ethnic Han followers. Monks from Labrang arrived to greet them.The Yeshi family has its immediate roots in the Tibetan exile community of Dharamsala, in northern India \u2014 the \u201cforbidden land,\u201d as Dechen jokes.That is where Dechen\u2019s parents live and where she grew up. There, the family had heard countless grim tales of China\u2019s policies in Tibet, which the Chinese Army occupied in 1951. Nevertheless, they decided to try to engage with Tibetans in the Chinese-ruled region and make an attempt at social enterprise here.\u201cMy standpoint is to work with what we\u2019ve got; this is the situation here, and I\u2019m just going to work with what there is,\u201d said Kim Yeshi, Dechen\u2019s mother and a scholar of Tibetan religion originally from the United States. \u201cThere are a lot of things you have in hand. If you deal with those, there\u2019s a lot you can do to help improve the people\u2019s livelihoods and preserve their culture.\u201dMs. Yeshi met her Tibetan husband, Kalsang, while attending Vassar College. Then the pair moved to Charlottesville, Va., where Ms. Yeshi pursued graduate studies in Tibetan Buddhism at the University of Virginia. She then traveled to Dharamsala, the home of the Dalai Lama, to continue her studies.Her focus turned to yak wool and creating textiles with it. She mentioned the idea to Dechen.In 2004, Dechen, who had just graduated from Connecticut College, came to Amdo for the first time, as an aspiring documentary filmmaker. She returned the next year to travel for seven months with her younger brother, Genam. At her mother\u2019s request, they gathered two tons of yak wool to bring to Nepal to have it woven at a friend\u2019s workshop.In 2006, Ms. Yeshi came to help her daughter set up a workshop here. It was the first time she had set foot in Tibet.\u201cThe strangest reaction I had was that you could just drive through and get from one area to another,\u201d she said. \u201cThe stories I had heard were that travel to places in this area was one to two days by horse.\u201dMs. Yeshi said she also found that \u201cyoung people don\u2019t want to become nomads anymore.\u201d\u201cChildren who have been to school can\u2019t imagine the type of life a nomad would have, especially the women,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s change that happens because of the way life evolves, markets evolve.\u201dThey found land for the textile workshop by the village of Zorge Ritoma, which has 200 nomadic households. The Yeshi family members and some locals traveled to Cambodia and Nepal to train in weaving. Machines in the workshop are from Nepal, and Nepalese sometimes come to teach the nomads.The textile business now has 120 employees, about 110 at the workshop itself.\u201cProviding jobs in a village, people could continue to live together, and people could stay with their parents and kids,\u201d Dechen said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to leave their hometown for jobs.\u201dHer mother said the long-term goal is to figure out how to replicate these efforts around the plateau to create a sustainable economy for nomads.\u201cI think if we can be successful with Norlha, a lot of people will see what\u2019s possible,\u201d Ms. Yeshi said. \u201cOther people may try what we\u2019re doing. Maybe if we\u2019re lucky, we can have basic management courses on how to run businesses in a modern way, in an efficient way.\u201dThough he has ancestral roots in the area, Dechen\u2019s husband, Yidam, said he had been reluctant to move to Amdo, having grown up among exiles in India. But he has settled here now, and Norden Camp is his project. Yidam secured a 10-year land lease because of his family background.The head of food at the camp is an American, Andy Knott, who used to work at an Aman resort in Bhutan. Mr. Knott sometimes doubles as the bartender. The Yeshi family employs a few other Americans.But the 20 or so camp employees are mostly from nomad families in the area. A front-desk manager, Jamyang, 30, grew up in a nomad family, then began traveling himself at age 16, going to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, to learn English. He ended up at Norden Camp because he knew Yidam.\u201cI like working here because the environment is so natural,\u201d he said. \u201cI grew up on the grasslands. This is like the place of my childhood.\u201dGilles Sabrie contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Affluent and Black, and Still Trapped by Segregation", "Date": "2016-08-20", "News": "Why well-off black families end up living in poorer areas than white families with similar or even lower incomes.Supported byMILWAUKEE \u2014 Their daughter was sick and they needed family around to help care for her, so JoAnne and Maanaan Sabir took an unexpected detour.They had spent years blowing past mileposts: earning advanced degrees and six-figure incomes, buying a 2,500-square-foot Victorian with hardwood floors. Yet here they were, both 37, moving to a corner of town pocked by empty lots, cramming into an apartment above Ms. Sabir\u2019s mother, in the very duplex that Ms. Sabir\u2019s grandparents had bought six decades earlier.Their new dwelling was in a part of the Lindsay Heights neighborhood where more than one in three families lives in poverty; gunshots were too often a part of the nighttime soundtrack. They planned to leave once their daughter, Ameera, was healthy.But then, reminding them of why they feel at home in communities like this one, their new neighbors started frequently checking on Ameera: Is she doing O.K.? And on their son, Taj: When\u2019s his next basketball game? Mr. Sabir\u2019s car stalled in the middle of the street one night, and it was the young men too often stereotyped as suspicious who helped him push it home. So many welcoming black faces like their own, they thought.\u201cIt felt like that\u2019s where we should be,\u201d Ms. Sabir said.It is a national phenomenon challenging the popular assumption that segregation is more about class than about race, that when black families earn more money, some ideal of post-racial integration will inevitably be reached.In fact, a New York Times analysis of 2014 census figures shows that income alone cannot explain, nor would it likely end, the segregation that has defined American cities and suburbs for generations.The result: Nationally, black and white families of similar incomes still live in separate worlds.In many of America\u2019s largest metropolitan areas, including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, black families making $100,000 or more are more likely to live in poorer neighborhoods than even white households making less than $25,000. This is particularly true in areas with a long history of residential segregation, like metropolitan Milwaukee.In one neighborhood on Milwaukee\u2019s predominantly black north side, that means the appearance of a new 4,000-square-foot home owned by a black energy executive and her husband, who host political fund-raisers with valet parking. Nearby, a financial adviser and his wife are stuck in the starter home they bought about 10 years ago, because it lost value and they couldn\u2019t sell it. Up the street, there\u2019s an engineer, living with her family, who said she stayed in the city for its amenities and to send the message, \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to run away.\u201dThe Sabirs share that mix of civic-minded motivation, and limitations. They are successful small-business owners with college degrees, yet even their choices have been circumscribed. The Victorian home they bought a decade ago, which they are now renting out, is in a majority black neighborhood where poverty has increased, damaging their investment. Their current neighborhood, where the duplex is, has a median household income of just $34,000 a year, or around $20,000 less than what\u2019s typical for the region.It\u2019s one of many ways that living around people whom they best relate to means wrestling day and night with the cumulative effects of racism.The burning cars and buildings, the people throwing rocks and bottles at police officers in riot gear \u2014 it was all happening last Saturday as Maanaan and JoAnne Sabir were settling in for the night just a few miles down the road.The 23-year-old man who had been shot by a black officer had ignored orders to drop a gun as he fled on foot after being pulled over in his car, the police said.\u201cYou\u2019re asking us to do the impossible, which is to tolerate a systemic demoralization of our own livelihood,\u201d Mr. Sabir said.Black families in Milwaukee have been confronting hostility for decades. Zeddie Quitman Hyler directly challenged housing segregation in 1955 when he began laying the foundation for a house on an open patch of land in the white western suburb of Wauwatosa.A postal worker and World War II veteran from rural Mississippi, Mr. Hyler was the first black man to try to build there, and his efforts were not appreciated. He returned to his construction site one day to find the frame damaged. He fixed it, but when he came back again, it had burned.So he enlisted several friends to camp out with him at the construction site one evening, rifles in hand, ready to turn away intruders. The vandals never returned, and Mr. Hyler finished building his house, which he lived in for nearly half a century until his death in 2004.While Mr. Hyler was branching out, Ms. Sabir\u2019s grandparents found themselves falling into the familiar cycle of segregation. Migrants from the South, they spent about 10 years trying to buy a house at a time when black families were overtly steered to particular blocks. Eventually, a family member who was a real estate agent worked her connections, and they landed the duplex on the corner of North 17th Street and North Avenue in the mid-1950s. The neighborhood was evolving from one that had been flush with synagogues and restaurants selling matzo ball soup.They were caught in the middle of white flight.The census tract where Ms. Sabir\u2019s grandparents settled was entirely white in 1950 except for the two people that the census listed as black and the six listed as \u201cother.\u201d By 1960, however, 2,344 black people called the area home, accounting for 65 percent of its population.Within a few years, Milwaukee\u2019s economy would start tanking. Tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs in the city were eliminated. Property values fell, while housing policies made it nearly impossible for black families to obtain loans and move to the suburbs, where many jobs were being relocated.The racial dividing lines were already drawn, however, and barriers to black upward mobility remained. Even the neighborhood where the baseball slugger Hank Aaron moved in the late 1950s could not avoid a downward spiral. While the black population in the Rufus King area grew from 0.4 percent in 1960 to 89 percent in 1980, its median home value dropped from 9 percent above the city\u2019s median to 23 percent below it, according to \u201cMilwaukee: City of Neighborhoods,\u201d a book by John Gurda.Few people around here are surprised, then, that only 11.1 percent of African-Americans in the region live in the suburbs, the lowest rate of black suburbanization among the 50 largest metropolitan areas in the country, according to a soon-to-be released study by Marc V. Levine, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.Milwaukee itself, which is nearly two-thirds nonwhite, has never elected a black mayor. As for Wauwatosa, the suburb that Mr. Hyler changed a generation ago, it is still 90 percent white.The Sabirs are trying to help their children maneuver through this complicated racial landscape.Taj and Ameera go to a Catholic private school in Milwaukee where most of the students are white, but return to a Muslim household in a neighborhood where most people look like them. Both environments present difficulties.At school, the Sabir children have heard a teacher play down slavery, and classmates stereotype black neighborhoods as bad and drug infested. On their block, where the sidewalks are cracked and some empty lots have been turned into gardens, they occasionally see drugs and fights.It\u2019s at times like those when JoAnne and Maanaan Sabir are happy that their children can come home, see the nuance of the black struggle and work to change it \u2014 as when Ameera helped petition to prevent a liquor store from opening in the neighborhood. Or when the children volunteer at a food bank down the block.Still, their parents can\u2019t help but flirt with the possibilities of another life. That\u2019s what they were doing one evening in late June as they cruised through the plush suburbs, partaking in a semiregular ritual of soaking in the Lake Michigan mansions and manicured lawns and wondering about life there. They rolled past children riding their bicycles alone at around 9 p.m., and Ms. Sabir marveled that they could do that.She thought back to when Taj, 12, had confronted her a few days earlier. He had asked for permission to ride his eight-speed bike around the block. Ms. Sabir could not go out to supervise him, so she said no.\u201cAre you finally going to admit that we live in a dangerous community?\u201d he said.Ms. Sabir pondered the question. She is trained for these moments, with a bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology and a master\u2019s in administrative social work, but she struggled. \u201cWe have challenges like every other community has challenges,\u201d she told him, adding, \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to figure out the best way to negotiate those challenges.\u201dManaging sometimes means moving on. And in Milwaukee\u2019s circle of affluent black professionals, that sometimes means decamping for majority white areas in the city or the suburbs.That\u2019s where Latisha Spence-Brookens and X\u2019antony Brookens Sr. found themselves five years ago after their North Milwaukee neighborhood rapidly deteriorated during the housing crash.They rolled into their new bungalow-style rental house in the village of Whitefish Bay, a suburb perched on Lake Michigan with a population so white (90 percent) that it has earned the moniker Whitefolks Bay. And then they looked around in amazement. People were walking. Everywhere.Some strolled past the two-story homes with red, white and blue bunting on the balconies. Others strolled along the main thoroughfare with a Starbucks, a sidewalk cafe, a store selling handblown glass, and a supermarket featuring live lobster, a full-service florist and Champagne caper vinaigrette.The Milwaukee neighborhood they had left behind, which was nearly 93 percent black, wasn\u2019t much for this kind of leisure. After they bought a two-bedroom home in 2008 for $98,000, the effects of the housing market collapse spread through the area. Homes were abandoned. Crime took over.Their son, X\u2019antony Jr., now 18, was walking home one afternoon, toting a plastic Walmart bag with a Barbie he had just bought for his little sister, Zaria, when a man approached him with a large rock in his hand.\u201cGive me all your money or I\u2019m going to bash your head in with this rock,\u201d the man told him.X\u2019antony Jr. hesitated.\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThis was my first time being robbed.\u201dSo he offered $5 to the robber, who took it and let X\u2019antony Jr. keep the Barbie.For X\u2019antony Sr., 48, the last straw came when a neighbor was held up at gunpoint as she came home with her two toddlers. It was too dangerous to stay, he thought.Their home value had plummeted by some 75 percent by then. They had no equity to buy up. So they walked away from the mortgage and rented a house in Whitefish Bay for $1,450 a month, nearly one and a half times what they had been paying for the home they owned.But finally, they thought, Zaria could ride her bicycle freely. X\u2019antony Jr. could enroll in a high-performing school district.Over the years, the Brookenses genuinely enjoyed their time in Whitefish Bay. Ms. Spence-Brookens, 39, worked as a college administrator and Mr. Brookens as a job counselor for food stamp recipients, and they sometimes would make it a point to get home early from work so they could spend time in the community. But it was hard to shake that feeling of otherness \u2014 especially for X\u2019antony Sr.About a week after the family moved there, a police officer pulled him over as he rolled up in his red 1994 Mercedes-Benz to the family\u2019s modest clapboard.He was pulled over, the officer said, because of the plastic cover over his license plate. Back in his old neighborhood, Mr. Brookens said, people often stole license plates, so the cover was for security. Here it was illegal, the officer told him. He let Mr. Brookens off with a warning, but not before asking if he lived around there.\u201cYeah, this is my house right here,\u201d Mr. Brookens told him.The stops were a routine occurrence early on \u2014 about once a week for a month and a half, Mr. Brookens said. He called it getting registered.\u201cThey\u2019re going to keep doing that until they become comfortable with who you are and why you\u2019re here,\u201d said Mr. Brookens, more resigned than angry.He had more disgust, however, when he took Zaria around the block on her bicycle and a mother rushed her white children inside as they approached.Mr. Brookens and his wife also worried about Zaria\u2019s sense of self. She always wanted to straighten her hair. She once bawled when her hair got wet in the bathtub and became frizzy. Zaria\u2019s school friends called her their black friend. Her musical tastes gravitated toward Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift.\u201cI thought she was getting lost,\u201d Mr. Brookens said.That was not necessarily in the front of the Brookenses\u2019 minds when, two years ago, a friend asked them to rent her cream-colored brick home in Milwaukee. It was surrounded by quiet bungalows and curved streets. It was bigger than their Whitefish Bay rental, and the rent was $350 cheaper.They thought of how the savings would allow them to do more of the things they like, such as travel. Although the house was in a neighborhood with a poverty rate 12 times higher and a median home value about one-third of that in their suburban neighborhood, they saw it as a place they could call home.So they returned to Milwaukee, to a different black neighborhood, joining the cluster of families like their own on the city\u2019s north side.Some of the old challenges re-emerged.About a month after moving there in 2014, Mr. Brookens forgot to lock his car door, and his charger and computer hard drive were stolen.Still, like many black families who have made similar choices, they say they feel more comfortable. Zaria, who recently turned 9, relishes seeing more children at school who look like her, and has come to embrace her blackness, going so far as to get dreadlocks. X\u2019antony Jr. has spent the summer working for an activist organization.The Brookenses now interact more frequently with their neighbors. They host cookouts regularly in their backyard, and they have decorated their shelves with plaques reminding them: \u201cHope is believing\u201d and \u201cFaith is endless.\u201dHope and faith, and determination, drive the Sabirs, too.That\u2019s what brought JoAnne Sabir\u2019s ancestors up here from Tennessee and Arkansas. It\u2019s why Mr. Sabir, a fourth-degree black belt in karate, is constantly pushing to help the young men he sees roaming the streets \u2014 \u201cYou got that r\u00e9sum\u00e9?\u201d he asks \u2014 and it\u2019s why the family is staking its business interests just a block from their apartment.They bet on the neighborhood by opening the Juice Kitchen in October. They both work there, often rising before 6 a.m., because they want to be a beacon of black success and help prevent drugs, alcohol and poverty from consuming the community.\u201cStrategically placed on North 17th Street,\u201d she wrote. \u201cStrategically available to love and nurture.\u201dA few hours later, she herded her children into her black sport-utility vehicle and slowly rolled past the remnants of the two nights of clashes between protesters and the police. Past the BP gas station, melted into an ashy heap. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible,\u201d Taj said. Past the people barbecuing on a grassy knoll. \u201cThat\u2019s the young man\u2019s brother over there that was killed,\u201d Ms. Sabir said. Past a boarded-up bank. \u201cThey broke in this bank and then set it on fire,\u201d she said.\u201cMy initial thought,\u201d Ms. Sabir told her children, \u201cwas that on this evening, all these young people were so powerful.\u201d But imagine, she added, if they could channel that anger in a positive direction, \u201cif we took that power and that energy and put it toward our greater good.\u201dEveryone in the car fell silent.Focusing on the bigger picture can be difficult.The following evening, on Wednesday night, as Mr. Sabir reclined on his front stoop, he shook his head as car after car whizzed through red lights at the corner. He mentioned a man from the neighborhood who was left in a vegetative state when an S.U.V. plowed into his car a few weeks earlier. \u201cIt aches,\u201d Mr. Sabir said.He rolled his eyes when a car pulled up to a house across the street at about 10:30 p.m. and started honking loudly. \u201cEvery night,\u201d Mr. Sabir said.And he just looked away when a man strolling in front of his house ditched a knife behind a parked car, only to be confronted by two police officers, with Tasers drawn, who arrested him. \u201cMass incarceration,\u201d Mr. Sabir said.But just as it seemed that the burdens of living here were converging, Mr. Sabir\u2019s phone buzzed with a reminder of why it was all worth it. The alderman representing the area where most of the past week\u2019s vandalism had occurred wrote that his battered neighborhood could really use a Juice Kitchen.\u201cHelp us,\u201d the alderman wrote, \u201cbe the Phoenix that rises from the ashes.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Now Britain\u2019s exit from the bloc holds the risk of introducing new friction, from the economy to the management of Northern Ireland\u2019s sectarian tensions to the familial, social and cultural ties that bind the inhabitants of the islands.Four decades of European integration have helped Ireland not only escape the shadow of Britain, but also improve relations with London and work with the British for peace in Northern Ireland. Now the question is whether Britain\u2019s departure from the bloc will drive a wedge between them.The return of a hard border could affect the fragile peace process, with Sinn Fein, the dominant party among Catholics in Northern Ireland, already using the so-called Brexit vote as reason to call for a referendum on uniting Northern Ireland and Ireland. At the same time, Irish politicians also worry about the economic stability of Northern Ireland, which depends heavily on subsidies from London and the European Union. They wonder whether British taxpayers will pick up the tab for cuts in European funding.\u201cI think that it\u2019s an enormous moment and potentially a catastrophic moment in terms of Ireland\u2019s narrow interests as well as those of the wider European Union,\u201d said Eunan O\u2019Halpin, a professor of contemporary Irish history at Trinity College Dublin. \u201cOur neighbors have burned the house down, and once the edifice collapses, we have to see how we can fix our walls.\u201dYet even an economically transformed Ireland, he said, cannot escape the ramifications of a referendum by a large neighbor with whom it shares centuries of troubled history.\u201cThere are potential negative impacts across every government department, from energy to agriculture, the environment,\u201d Mr. Flanagan said at his office in Dublin. \u201cOur job in the negotiations will be to mitigate these losses and minimize the damage.\u201dPat Cox, a former president of the European Parliament, said the European dimension played a crucial role in strengthening relations between Dublin and London. Membership made Ireland important in its own right and allowed it to differentiate itself from Britain, and to pick and choose policies best suiting its interests.Like the British, the Irish stayed out of the passport-free Schengen travel zone, but unlike Britain, Ireland joined the European single currency. A shared, free-market economic perspective, however, made the two nations allies in Brussels.\u201cWe got to know each other very well over 40 years by showing up at the same tables in Brussels and elsewhere, not on the basis of equal size but on the basis of equality of status of member states, which for a small state matters,\u201d Mr. Cox said.\u201cThis radically changed the quality of dialogue between Irish and British leaders over time,\u201d he added, while fostering the \u201cmutual respect and understanding\u201d that made the Northern Ireland peace process possible.If Britain leaves the European Union\u2019s single market, as seems likely to happen, trading with the British would most likely involve new customs requirements, and possibly tariffs.Paddy Malone of Dundalk\u2019s chamber of commerce said he worried that customs checks would reverse the integration around the border area. \u201cEven if it\u2019s only extra paperwork, it\u2019s still an administration burden,\u201d Mr. Malone said. \u201cIt means that people in both jurisdictions will start looking elsewhere for new suppliers and customers.\u201dThe future of the border is crucial not just for trade but for the free movement of people across it. Britain and Ireland enjoyed a common travel area before joining the European Economic Community in 1973.Yet Britain\u2019s exit creates a situation with one country inside the European Union and one outside. The road from Dundalk to Newry, Northern Ireland, will therefore cross an external frontier of the bloc. While Prime Minister Enda Kenny of Ireland and the new British prime minister, Theresa May, stress that changes can be kept minimal, that was not what Mrs. May said before Britain\u2019s referendum when she warned of restrictions in the event of a Brexit.For many in Britain, a prime motivation for the vote was to \u201ctake back control\u201d of its borders. If Britain does leave the union, it will be difficult to avoid immigration checks at the Irish border or between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain, though the latter would be controversial in Belfast.Mr. Flanagan described a heavily fortified border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, with immigration controls, as \u201cunthinkable,\u201d but said he could not rule out some customs checks. \u201cIf there are to be some customs points, modern technology could be used to the full in terms of the identification and checking of goods,\u201d he added.While Ireland aims to minimize the impact of the Brexit vote, it is just one voice among the 27 nations remaining in the union that would shape a deal with Britain.There are, however, some opportunities for Ireland. If Britain loses access to the European Union\u2019s single market, some of its banks may shift their operations to Dublin. Ireland could become more important diplomatically for the United States because of its voice inside the European Union.Tom MacGuinness, the founder of Horseware, which sells equine equipment around the world, said the referendum result had meant uncertainty for Irish businesses, but he remains upbeat.\u201cYou really can\u2019t plan these things,\u201d he said at his modern factory and warehouse in Dundalk. \u201cYou have to roll with the punches. You have to be nimble.\u201dThe Brexit vote, he said, will leave Ireland less tied to Britain.\u201cThe Irish are no longer mentally, physically or psychologically bound\u201d to Britain, he said. \u201cThis will accelerate that process, no question,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is going to accelerate the Irish Europeanization.\u201dFollow Stephen Castle on Twitter @_StephenCastleAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In a Victory for Modi, India Overhauls Its Tangled Tax System", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBANGALORE, India \u2014 Lawmakers cleared the way on Wednesday for India to forge a single economic zone from its thicket of overlapping federal and state taxes, the most important economic measure since India opened its markets in 1991.Potentially one of the most dynamic economies in the developing world, India is hampered by a bewildering array of state-by-state tax codes that discourage doing business across state borders.The Goods and Services Tax is widely viewed as a breakthrough that will allow the authorities to confront the problem, eventually creating a more unified economy that will allow businesses to expand nationwide far more easily.Economists forecast that the new tax scheme, which replaces 15 existing state and federal taxes, could increase the country\u2019s economic growth rate by between 0.5 and two percentage points.Though a long series of legislative steps must be taken before the new tax system goes into effect, Wednesday\u2019s approval of a constitutional amendment by the upper house of Parliament, which is not controlled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s party, was seen as the most daunting obstacle.\u201cIt\u2019s important for Modi,\u201d Mr. Vaishnav added, \u201cwho has been reeling under this criticism that he hasn\u2019t done enough in terms of big-bang reform. It completely reshapes how business is going to be done.\u201dThe benefits of the new tax regime are likely to emerge gradually, and may not be evident before Mr. Modi\u2019s party seeks re-election in 2019.Over the long term, though, it is expected to attract foreign investment and bring down the cost of capital goods, lift manufacturing and exports, increase tax collections and \u2014 perhaps most important, in a country where one million young people enter the work force each month \u2014 create jobs.\u201cThis will be the mother of all economic reforms in India so far,\u201d said Sachin Menon, who oversees indirect taxes at KPMG India, an accounting and consulting firm.Business leaders said the change would have a profound effect on their daily lives. Praveen Khandelwal, a senior leader of the Confederation of All-India Traders, said businesses currently were \u201charassed and victimized\u201d by the cascading demands of multiple tax authorities.\u201cMost of the time we are busy in complying with those taxation formalities, collecting taxes, depositing taxes, submission of forms, our money stuck in the system, and other issues,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t find time to do business.\u201dThe drawbacks of state-dictated tax policies have long been recognized, but lawmakers were stymied. Simplifying the system required the political muscle to persuade states, especially large, wealthy ones like Mr. Modi\u2019s home state of Gujarat, to surrender control over tax revenues.A Goods and Services Tax bill was first introduced by the Indian National Congress party in 2011, but has since been blocked by whichever of the two main parties was not in control of Parliament. Before 2014, it was Mr. Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party, commonly called the B.J.P., that disapproved of the measure. The Congress Party has opposed it since then.Resistance to the plan had eased in recent months, as the B.J.P. put greater effort into winning over the smaller regional parties that had opposed the bill. Meanwhile, the Congress Party\u2019s share of seats in the Parliament\u2019s upper house, the Rajya Sabha, has been shrinking.\u201cI think the logjam broke now because the Congress found it was largely isolated,\u201d said Mihir Sharma, a columnist and senior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation.Introducing the new system will not be quick or easy, and the government will be hard pressed to put it in place by the current deadline of April 1, 2017.Technically, the parliamentary vote on Wednesday approved only a constitutional amendment on the new tax system, the first of many steps needed to enact the tax measure, usually referred to by its initials, G.S.T. The constitutional amendment must also be approved by a majority of India\u2019s state legislatures and by the president. Once it is approved, which is expected, Parliament must enact legislation to create the new tax system, and individual states must pass their own laws.Still to be settled is the thorny issue of tax rates. States will want high rates, to maximize revenue, and the central government will push for lower rates to avoid sparking inflation, said Pranjul Bhandari, the chief India economist at HSBC bank in Mumbai. \u201cYou have to tread the very thin line between making political parties happy and making the state governments happy,\u201d she said.India\u2019s economy is growing at a robust 7.6 percent while enjoying the lowest inflation in decades. But job growth has been sluggish, and the corporate sector remains starved of cash.Tension over the economy\u2019s performance came to a head this summer, when India\u2019s respected Central Bank governor, Raghuram Rajan, who had resisted pressure from right-wing leaders to make deep cuts to interest rates to spur growth, decided to return to academia after his term ended in September. Mr. Modi\u2019s government followed up, almost immediately, by throwing open new sectors to foreign investment.Surjit Bhalla, a macroeconomic adviser on India to the Observatory Group, a consultancy in New York, compared the new tax regime to the industrial deregulation of 1991 and said it should put to rest any doubts about Mr. Modi\u2019s credentials as an economic modernizer. \u201cIt\u2019s a mega-reform, and it comes under his leadership, which is why he and the B.J.P. were very keen to get it passed,\u201d he said.Ellen Barry reported from Bangalore, and Hari Kumar from New Delhi.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How the Middle Class May Have Gotten a Raise", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIncomes and OutcomesThe typical American family earns $53,657, according to the latest estimates of median household income produced by the Census Bureau. Adjusted for inflation, that figure is $3,700 less than it was in 2007 and $4,067 less than in 2000. These declines are the chief evidence that Americans aren\u2019t doing as well economically as they used to.But the Census Bureau\u2019s estimates of income stop in 2014. It will not release those for 2015 until next month, and early estimates suggest that household incomes may be way up.Sentier Research, a research firm formed by two former Census Bureau employees, estimates that real median household incomes grew nearly 3.8 percent in 2015. This would be the largest annual gain in household income since Sentier began producing the series in 2000.Sentier infers a monthly household income number based on data from the monthly household survey used to estimate unemployment, a program run jointly by the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the big census report on income, poverty and health insurance relies on a more comprehensive survey called the Annual Social and Economic Supplement, or A.S.E.C., which is collected every March. In the meantime, Sentier\u2019s household estimates fill in the gaps.Official income distribution numbers are hard to come by. The Bureau of Economic Analysis produces a personal income figure using administrative data, data collected by government agencies, business and trade associations, but it can give only a headline total or per-capita number \u2014 nothing on the typical household. You could also infer wages by the amount of money spent on this category from the employer side using the B.L.S.\u2019s establishment survey, but again you won\u2019t get a distribution.So why is 2015 looking so good for households? Gordon Green, one author of the report, says that low inflation has a lot to do with rising real incomes. The growth in real income, or the amount of things a household can buy, is a result of the difference between changes in prices and nominal incomes.If prices grow faster than income, real incomes fall, but if nominal incomes grow faster than prices, real incomes grow. In 2015, inflation was extraordinarily low, growing at a meager tenth of a percent instead of 2 percent, the average inflation rate of the previous five years. This means that any nominal income growth in 2015 was transformed into an increase in purchasing power.Using a measure of inflation that excludes food and energy (the most volatile components of the Consumer Price Index), inflation ticks up to 1.8 percent. And deflating Sentier\u2019s household income numbers with this measure of inflation reduces real median household income growth to 2.1 percent.But still, that means 2.1 percent of household income growth can be chalked up to real positive changes for working households: more work and more money for that work. In 2015, the number of people working relative to the overall population grew 0.3 percent, and average hourly earnings grew by 2.3 percent.Lawrence Mishel, president of the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, expects the official household income number to be strong: \u201cI will say that it will be between 1 and 2 percent growth. I lean more toward 2. You\u2019ll probably see strong income growth and some reduction in poverty, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll find that household income will return to their prior levels in 1999.\u201dOf course, even if the Census Bureau\u2019s household income figure does indeed grow by 3.8 percent, there will still be plenty of legitimate economic concerns for the candidates. Inequality remains high, technological change is poised to disrupt millions of jobs, and manufacturing is still on the decline. What is clear is that not even a strong household income number will let the two candidates avoid grappling with a murkier narrative about the American economy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big Banks Make a Pitch for Hearts and Minds", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt both the Democratic and Republican conventions, the nation\u2019s biggest banks were again cast as the bad guys, criticized as being too big and too risky.This week, as the Olympic Games begin in Brazil, one of the big banks, Citigroup, is offering a rebuttal with a series of prime-time television and digital ads featuring images of sweaty athletes, the Space Shuttle and an early A.T.M.\u201cOur business is helping Americans make progress,\u201d the ad\u2019s narrator says, as a runner with a prosthetic leg sprints down a track.Since the 2008 financial crisis, American banks have spent millions of dollars on advertising, consultants and social media initiatives, seeking to portray themselves as something other than greedy risk-takers. And yet, eight years later, anger and resentment persists.So the banks are ramping up their efforts \u2014 and trying new ways \u2014 to convince the public that they are not as bad as politicians make them out to be.Citigroup, which was rescued by taxpayers after nearly collapsing during the financial crisis, is using its role as the sole banking sponsor of the Summer Olympics and Paralympics to make the case for the virtues of being a big global bank.And Bank of America has hired Bob Dylan\u2019s son Jesse to produce a series of videos explaining to bank employees that their primary purpose is not to reap quick profits, but to help expand the economy.\u201cWe can\u2019t advertise our way into people\u2019s hearts,\u201d said Ed Skyler, Citigroup\u2019s executive vice president for public affairs, who is overseeing the bank\u2019s advertising. \u201cBut we have to keep talking about the value we bring to society.\u201dThe bank\u2019s two-week advertising campaign will include an ad that ties together Citigroup\u2019s sponsorship of the American athletes to the bank\u2019s role in fueling the global economy. Citigroup also plans to run an ad highlighting the bank\u2019s role in rebuilding Europe after World War II through the Marshall Plan and in the construction of the Panama Canal.That ad, which was first produced for Citigroup\u2019s 200th anniversary in 2012, depicts a young woman riding a bike and an image of Theodore Roosevelt, a president who was not exactly Wall Street\u2019s biggest fan. The ads are expected to start running during the opening ceremony on Friday, though they are already available online.Even as regulators today declare that banks are safer and more secure than they have been in decades, the animus in some quarters seems to be intensifying.The Democratic Party\u2019s platform includes a plank that calls for breaking up big banks if they are deemed too risky. And Hillary Clinton said in her convention speech that she would push to make sure Wall Street and the superrich paid their \u201cfair share of taxes.\u201dInvestors are also questioning whether big banks can ever again increase returns in such a heavily regulated industry, driving down some of their share prices while most of the stock market rallies.\u201cI don\u2019t think there is any one magical thing they can do to improve their image,\u201d said Donald Kohn, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. \u201cThat\u2019s going to take time. People are going to have to see that the banks are safer, that they are not enjoying any implicit public subsidies.\u201dSome bank executives acknowledge that they have failed to adequately convey to the public the benefits of a large modern bank.When Mr. Dimon was asked in February how he would explain to an analyst\u2019s mother-in-law the benefit of being a large bank, he conceded, \u201cWe have a hard time explaining those things to the public.\u201dMr. Dimon went on to say: \u201cWe make loans. We help companies. We help communities. We are the Rock of Gibraltar in the tough times.\u201d He cited the bank\u2019s purchase of Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual during the financial crisis as an example of its role in bolstering the broader financial system \u2014 something a smaller bank could never pull off.In addition to the television ad campaign, Citigroup\u2019s chief executive, Mike Corbat, has been laying out the case for big banks in speeches far from Wall Street and Washington \u2014 in places like the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce.Large global banks like Citigroup, Mr. Corbat said in a speech last October, are better equipped to help multinational companies across the world exchange currencies and make payments. That, in turn, helps increase the global economy, he said.But many Americans are also starting to question the benefits of globalization, which is at the heart of the Wall Street\u2019s argument for staying big. The vote in Britain to leave the European Union and the popularity of Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist views do not help the big global banks.Bank of America is trying something even more basic. Rather than make the case to the public, the bank is reminding its employees \u2014 through a series of videos \u2014 of what a bank actually does.One of the videos, which is being shown to tellers, call center workers and even regulators, is titled the \u201cRole of a Bank\u201d and features a montage of images of small-town life: firefighters, farmers, factory workers and lots of children.It was created by Jesse Dylan\u2019s film production company, Wondros, which also produced a music video inspired by Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign mantra \u201cYes We Can.\u201dIt might seem curious that the nation\u2019s third-largest bank by assets feels the need to explain to its employees something as basic as how a bank takes deposits and lends them out in the community.But bank executives say the videos are part of the strategy of its chief executive, Brian Moynihan, to focus employees\u2019 attention on the bank\u2019s supporting role in the economy, and not on a quest for the kinds of profits that were gained and then lost in the lead-up to the financial crisis.The hope, the executives say, is that if employees believe that they have a higher purpose, it will rub off on the bank\u2019s public image.\u201cIt is a long road back for the banks,\u201d Mr. Dylan said. \u201cThey have to earn that trust.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ignoring Advice, Donald Trump Presses Attack on Khan Family and G.O.P. Leaders", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDonald J. Trump\u2019s unabashed and continuing hostility toward the parents of a slain Muslim American soldier, and his attacks on Republican leaders who have rebuked him for it, threaten to shatter his uneasy alliance with the Republican Party at the outset of the general election campaign.He also belittled Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, who had criticized his treatment of the Khans, for not being supportive of his campaign.For days, Mr. Trump\u2019s top advisers and allies have urged him to move on from the feud, which erupted when Mr. Khan criticized him at the Democratic convention, and focus instead on the economy and the national security record of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Yet, facing outcry on the left and right, Mr. Trump has insisted to associates that he has been treated unfairly by Mr. Khan, the news media and some Republicans, said people familiar with the campaign\u2019s deliberations who insisted on anonymity to discuss them.Republicans now say Mr. Trump\u2019s obstinacy in addressing perhaps the gravest crisis of his campaign may trigger drastic defections within the party, and Republican lawmakers and strategists have begun to entertain abandoning him en masse.Mrs. Clinton, who explicitly courted Republicans at last week\u2019s convention, has already picked up a few telling Republican endorsements: Meg Whitman, the Hewlett Packard Enterprise executive who ran for governor of California as a Republican, backed Mrs. Clinton on Tuesday, as did Representative Richard Hanna of New York, a moderate Republican. Both denounced Mr. Trump\u2019s treatment of the Khan family.Still, the Trump campaign has left open the door to continued conflict with the Khan family. A memo circulated by Mr. Trump\u2019s aides on Tuesday to his campaign surrogates urged them to express gratitude for the Khans\u2019 sacrifice, but added that Mr. Trump had a \u201cright to defend himself,\u201d a person who received the document said.In Mr. Trump\u2019s five-day confrontation with a military family, Republicans have found the most agonizing test yet of their relationship with a candidate who has flouted political conventions around religion, race, gender and now military service. Republican strategists who once imagined Mr. Trump could be brought under control in a general election all but openly acknowledged this week that that prospect had vanished.Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers have impressed upon him for days that his clash with the Khans was counterproductive, urging him instead to show deference to them and train his attacks on Mrs. Clinton, people close to the campaign said. Emissaries from the Trump campaign who spoke with Republican lawmakers and party officials in Washington were given the same bracing assessment. A few Republicans in Washington even suggested that Mr. Trump should apologize to the Khans.Mr. Trump has instead gone in the opposite direction, standing by his harsh treatment of the couple and brazenly antagonizing Washington Republicans.Liesl Hickey, a Republican strategist who led the party\u2019s defense of its majority in the House of Representatives in 2014, said lawmakers should feel liberated to split with Mr. Trump if their survival depended on it.Ms. Hickey has quietly circulated a battle plan to Republican leaders and vulnerable members of Congress, calling for a sharpened focus on winning over wavering Republicans, moderates and women \u2014 even if that means withdrawing support from Mr. Trump.\u201cEven if you were with Trump before, it doesn\u2019t mean that now you necessarily need to stay with him,\u201d she said.Ms. Hickey, who has worked extensively with Republicans in swing districts, said the urgent imperative for many of them was \u201cgetting away from the national message.\u201d She added, \u201cEverybody who hasn\u2019t fully kicked off their campaigns yet should be encouraged to do this.\u201dThe Republican Party has not yet come close to abandoning Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy: Most of the lawmakers who have denounced him for fighting with the Khans have not said they will vote against him in the general election.Even the Republicans assailed by Mr. Trump on Tuesday responded in muted language. Zack Roday, a spokesman for Mr. Ryan, said Mr. Ryan had not sought Mr. Trump\u2019s endorsement and was confident that he would win his primary. Ms. Ayotte, who faces re-election in November, wrote on Twitter that she would \u201calways stand up for our military families and what\u2019s best for the people of New Hampshire.\u201dWhile Donald J. Trump or Hillary Clinton will represent the entire country, the Americans who selected them are a small part of it.Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, has acknowledged the dispute with the Khans has harmed Mr. Trump, but he has pleaded with party leaders and donors to give Mr. Trump time to adjust to the general election, according to people briefed on Mr. Priebus\u2019s conversations.The Trump campaign has taken a few steps to recover its footing: Mr. Trump canceled a Thursday event in Plattsburgh, N.Y., a community with ties to the military in one of the country\u2019s most heavily Democratic states. Trump strategists said the campaign would redouble its criticism of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s support for military action in Iraq and Libya.Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s top political adviser, accused Mrs. Clinton of seeking to \u201cavoid a discussion of her failed record\u201d at the State Department by pursuing Mr. Trump on other fronts.\u201cThe Khan family has suffered an irreplaceable loss. For this loss, all Americans grieve,\u201d Mr. Manafort said in an email. \u201cThe way to avoid these tragedies from continuing is to have leadership that will not make the mistakes of the Obama/Clinton administration.\u201dEven one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most steadfast allies, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, said Tuesday that it was inappropriate to attack the Khan family.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to find me being critical of Mr. and Mrs. Khan no matter what,\u201d Mr. Christie said. \u201cIt\u2019s just inappropriate for us in this context to be criticizing them, and I\u2019m not going to participate in that.\u201dMr. Trump at first appeared on Tuesday to restrain himself, up to a point. At a campaign stop in Northern Virginia, he avoided mentioning the Khans by name, but continued to grumble about his treatment by the news media.He lamented to supporters that reporters had overlooked the story of Patricia Smith, the mother of a serviceman killed in the attack in Benghazi, Libya, in order to highlight \u201cother people\u201d \u2014 apparently a reference to the Khan family.\u201cThey give her virtually no airtime, and they give other people unbelievable amounts of airtime,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s just so unfair. It\u2019s so unfair.\u201dBy the end of the day, Mr. Trump had turned that grievance into an explosive confrontation with the leaders of his own party.Nick Corasaniti and Patrick McGeehan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

He also criticized Hillary Clinton and President Obama for what he called their \u201cjob-killing, tax-raising, poverty-inducing\u201d agenda. It was vintage Trump, full of promises of greatness and victories backed by fantastical proposals.The big problem with Mr. Trump\u2019s tax ideas is that they would leave a multitrillion-dollar deficit for no benefit. Proponents of supply-side economics argue that cutting tax rates encourages people to work and businesses to invest. But the gains are much more modest than proponents claim because many businesses won\u2019t invest unless demand for their products is growing and many people are not motivated by lower tax rates to work more.On trade, Mr. Trump renewed his pledge to kill the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an agreement that Mr. Obama negotiated with 11 countries. Mr. Trump claims he can bring back millions of manufacturing jobs to the United States by slapping retaliatory tariffs against China for manipulating its currency, offering illegal subsidies to its exporters and stealing intellectual property from American companies. But such actions would do nothing to recreate jobs that have been replaced by automation, and companies could move production to other developing countries. Mr. Trump\u2019s earlier pledge to put a 45 percent tariff on all Chinese goods would almost certainly start a trade war that would harm American industries that export goods to China.Mr. Trump considers himself a businessman, uniquely capable of improving the economy. But this list of misguided and risky proposals would reduce economic growth while showering the rich with tax breaks.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Olympics, Rio Is Altered if Not Reborn", "Date": "2016-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the criticism aside, the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio have profoundly altered this city of six million, yielding a revitalized port; a new subway line; and a flush of municipal projects, big and small, that had long been on the wish list of city planners.\u201cIf we set aside our political passions, it\u2019s plain to see that the Olympics have created an enormous legacy for Rio,\u201d said Pedro Corr\u00eaa do Lago, a historian, economist and former president of Brazil\u2019s national library. \u201cThese are improvements that might have otherwise taken 20 or 30 years to realize.\u201dTo many, it has become an article of faith that the modern Olympics are a drain on public coffers, a sop to corporate interests and a vanity project for glory-seeking leaders hoping to burnish their legacies and their nations\u2019 standing on the world stage.Brazil is no different. Born seven years ago in the heady days of an economic boom, these Games were initially seen as a triumphal capstone for a newly ascendant global power. Instead, as the country suffered through its worst recession in decades, the Games became an emblem of government waste and political hubris \u2014 and a target for protesters who dogged the Olympic torch relay as it wended its way across the country.But experts say the Games also served as a powerful catalyst for urban revitalization, spurring infrastructure projects, financed with taxpayer money and private investment, that will enhance the lives of Rio\u2019s residents.Nearly 100 miles of rapid bus lanes have slashed commuting times for thousands of the working poor.

A new subway line, the system\u2019s first major expansion in decades, began operating four days before the opening ceremony.The city said it had sped up the construction of more than 400 schools and health clinics in impoverished neighborhoods, part of what the mayor called a revitalization spurred by the Olympics.Still, critics say the Games have delivered uneven benefits, favoring upscale areas like Barra da Tijuca, the site of the Olympic Village, while ignoring hundreds of poor communities where residents live in jerry-built housing that lacks basic sanitation.\u201cThe Olympics have led to displacement, gentrification and sweet deals for real estate developers and construction companies,\u201d said Theresa Williamson, the executive director of Catalytic Communities, an advocacy group for the city\u2019s favelas.\u201cIt\u2019s undeniable that the infrastructure that has been built for the Games will benefit the population once the Olympics are over,\u201d said Barbara Mattos, an analyst at Moody\u2019s, the credit rating agency.Eduardo Paes, Rio\u2019s hard-charging mayor, who has aspirations of higher office, is quick to swat away criticism of the Games, calling the event a once-in-a-generation opportunity to lure investment to a city where fortunes have waned in the nearly six decades since the national capital moved from Rio to Bras\u00edlia.\u201cNo one ever said the Olympics were going to solve all of the city\u2019s problems,\u201d Mr. Paes said in an interview. \u201cBut we used the Games as a good excuse to get a lot of things done, things that have been the dream of mayors for 50 years.\u201dHe noted that the $12 billion budget for the Games was significantly lower than the expenses of other recent host cities \u2014 the roughly $15 billion spent on the 2012 London Games and the $51 billion that Russia lavished on the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.More important, Mr. Paes said, much of the money came from the private companies that built the Olympic Village and the Olympic golf course, as well as those that renovated the city\u2019s port, a project that includes a two-mile waterfront promenade and two new museums.Over all, he said, the city has built 75,000 units of affordable housing since 2009, although some estimates suggest that nearly as many people, most of them poor, lost their homes to projects related to the Olympics.Critics dispute some of Mr. Paes\u2019s figures, pointing out that cost overruns will most likely bring the final cost of the Games to $20 billion. Others note that the 3,600 apartments that make up the Olympic Village will end up as homes for the rich, and that the golf course, which required filling in protected wetlands, will serve only the wealthy.\u201cYes, the Olympic Village will be something for rich people,\u201d Mr. Paes said. \u201cBut there\u2019s no shame in that.\u201dIn a sign of the anger over the Games, a media bus was attacked on August 9 in an area torn apart for Olympic projects. But some analysts agree with Mr. Paes that the Games will not leave the city with significant debt.That assessment stood in stark contrast to the benefits seen in the estimated $11 billion that Brazil spent hosting the 2014 World Cup, which left behind a constellation of 12 new or renovated stadiums, most of which are not used regularly.Parsing the numbers can be tricky, of course, and Olympic hosts often fiddle with budget categories to conceal the true costs.Bent Flyvbjerg, an Oxford University economist and the lead researcher on a study that examined Rio\u2019s Olympic finances, said the actual amount spent on sports venues was most likely $4.6 billion, 51 percent over budget.That amount, Mr. Flyvbjerg said, placed Rio somewhere in the middle of host cities that have exceeded their spending projections.\u201cAll governments try to take the most convenient truth and spin it for their own purposes,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess if I was doing P.R. for the mayor of Rio, I\u2019d also say we\u2019re doing better than the previous three Olympics.\u201dIn recent years, Oslo, Boston and Munich, bowing to popular opposition, have dropped their Olympic ambitions. Over the last three decades, nearly every city that has hosted the Games has lost money, and few expect Rio to recoup the billions of dollars spent preparing for an event that lasts just weeks.\u201cFewer and fewer cities are willing to host the Olympics because they are a tremendous waste of resources,\u201d said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College and the author of \u201cCircus Maximus: The Economic Gamble Behind Hosting the Olympics and the World Cup.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no sensible way to rationalize the expenditures that have gone into this.\u201dBut city officials say the Olympics helped move the needle on infrastructure plans that had languished for years.In some poor neighborhoods, the Olympics served as a cudgel to speed the overhaul of public clinics that had been plagued by long waits and poor service. At one, in the troubled City of God favela, software now streamlines the triage process, a cheery ombudsman takes complaints and a new app lets supervisors track how long doctors spend with each patient \u2014 or whether they take inordinately long lunch breaks.\u201cIt\u2019s like night and day,\u201d said Elizabeth Rezende, 61, a retired maid waiting to get her electrocardiogram results after experiencing chest pain. \u201cThe other emergency hospitals are so chaotic.\u201dThe $2.5 billion rehabilitation, much of it financed through the sale of air rights from adjacent properties and tax incentives to developers, included demolishing the viaduct and funneling traffic through a new three-mile tunnel.\u201cIf we didn\u2019t get the Games, I\u2019m not sure this would have happened in our lifetime,\u201d said Alberto Silva, who is in charge of the project.Since opening in May, the port has been a hit with Brazilians, who crowd the waterfront promenade day and night, drawn by free concerts, food trucks and the opportunity for selfies in front of the Olympic flame.As she made her way through the elbow-to-elbow throngs, Maria Helana Lima, 49, a house cleaner, said she had initially shared the skepticism of friends who viewed the Games as a colossal waste of money.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to get excited about the Olympics when our hospitals are so overcrowded and people can\u2019t find jobs,\u201d she said. But sitting in the shadow of a new science museum by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, Ms. Lima said she had changed her mind.\u201cI\u2019m sure there was a lot of corruption and waste that went into this, but the end result is gorgeous and really cool,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is definitely a place I\u2019m going to come back to again and again.\u201dPaula Moura contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Venus Williams, Off the Court", "Date": "2016-08-27", "News": "At 36, Venus Williams is balancing a still-vibrant tennis career and her athletic-wear and interior design businesses.Supported byWEST PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 Venus Williams\u2019s ability to get around a tennis court quickly is well known. She is 6-foot-1 and nearly can get from one side to the other in a single side-step-leap-slide. Less known is her speed in taking meetings.Earlier this week, on Tuesday, Ms. Williams hit nearly every department of her fashion and interior design companies in about an hour and a half.Dressed in a hot pink tank top, heather gray capri yoga pants and hot pink sneakers, she hovered over a couch on which a panoply of tennis clothes had been draped: short-skirted tennis dresses with a bright geometric pattern; skirts in the same pattern; blue tank tops; visors; headbands; a fuchsia hoodie.\u201cI have been waiting to wear this dress, it is such a fun dress to wear,\u201d she said as she decided on one of the graphic dresses, the flagship piece of the new Prism collection, which she will debut next week on her own sort of New York runway, a tennis court in Queens.As she sifted through the Prism options, she was rethinking her braids. \u201cThe big question is what hair color now,\u201d she said as she pointed to splashes of blue and magenta in the dress\u2019s pattern. She quickly dismissed a suggestion that she braid in strands of all the colors. \u201cToo schizophrenic,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m liking the orange.\u201d Next meeting.Ms. Williams became a professional tennis player in 1994, when she was 14 years old, and quickly emerged onto the national tennis scene. She has won seven Grand Slam singles events and 14 more in women\u2019s doubles, playing alongside her sister Serena, 34. Venus has won five Wimbledon singles titles. In 2002, she became the first African-American woman to earn the world\u2019s top ranking in tennis since the onset of the open era in the late 1960s.\u201cPeople have been talking about this a lot,\u201d Venus said when asked about this. \u201cKudos to Andy Murray.\u201dVenus attributes her confidence as a designer to her sister. When Venus started out, her first collection was too conservative, she said, and had to be scrapped. \u201cThe real EleVen started to emerge after,\u201d she said. \u201cI designed a dress and I asked Serena what she thought. She said, \u2018Oh my god, I love it!\u2019 That\u2019s when my shoulders went up and I started feeling confident. Because you know sisters, they\u2019re always honest.\u201dAbout 10 years ago, she began to build a foundation for life off the tennis court by studying fashion and interior design, and business. In deciding on an undergraduate program focused on business administration, Ms. Williams contacted David Frantz, a professor of management at Indiana University East.All the coursework has fed into her two main businesses. EleVen, a four-year-old company, is undergoing a serious reboot since Ms. Williams hired two seasoned retail executives last year to help her centralize and take charge of operations.Sipping a green juice (she drinks so much water on the court that she avoids it elsewhere), she sat on a swivel chair as V*Starr designers filled her in on current projects.Ms. Williams leaned back. \u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201clet\u2019s find the best lamps we can for $200.\u201d She turned her chair to look at a floor plan for a space they were designing for a luxury multifamily building. Since she had last seen the plans, the client had asked the V*Starr team for alterations. \u201cI am still brokenhearted over the changes,\u201d Ms. Williams said. \u201cI guess I need to move on.\u201dMs. Williams eventually headed back into the warehouse space from where the orders of EleVen activewear are shipped to online customers and the boutiques, spas and fitness clubs that carry it. The inventory had been reorganized to make room for incoming shipments of the Prism collection.She climbed ladders and rooted through bins looking for certain pieces to pack into a box. She likes occasionally to tuck handwritten thank-you notes into packages going off to unsuspecting customers. \u201cI pitch in, every little bit helps, though I think they secretly check the boxes I pack to make sure I didn\u2019t screw anything up,\u201d she said.Today\u2019s practice, she said, would be modified. Instead of 20-minute-long cardio baseline drills, there would be 10-minute drills. And she would forgo her after-tennis workout. \u201cI usually just power through,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to make better choices.\u201dTo help combat the effect of Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, she pays close attention to her diet. She is \u201cchegan,\u201d as she put it, a vegan who sometimes cheats. (\u201cI like butter,\u201d she said.) When Serena told her she was cutting out sugar, Venus followed suit. \u201cIt\u2019s working very well for helping with energy,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m on Day 58. I have a little app and it keeps track.\u201dFor the United States Open, particularly, she needs to maintain her energy. \u201cThe U.S. Open is very New York,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is fast-paced, intense, you have to fight. Just getting on-site is an effort.\u201dOn her court, she and Mr. Jenkins worked on her cross-court backhand. She thwacked the ball and unleashed a signature grunt.\u201cLet me try that again,\u201d she called out to him. He fed her another and another. Harry puttered around on the adjacent court, which is where Serena usually practices. He will travel with her to New York but was unable to go to Rio. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get an Olympic pass for him,\u201d Ms. Williams said.On a water break, she tipped her head toward a couple practicing several courts away. \u201cI need to congratulate her, I haven\u2019t seen her since they got married,\u201d she said, and remarked that similar fitness interests are good for family ties. \u201cLook at us,\u201d she said, \u201cSerena and I are still playing doubles.\u201dThey have played against each other in the finals of eight Grand Slam events; Serena has beaten Venus six times. Venus seems prepared for the inevitable questions about sibling rivalry.\u201cYou probably want to win because you\u2019re the older sister and the younger sister wants to win because she\u2019s the younger sister. We don\u2019t talk about it much,\u201d she said, later adding, \u201cLosing is no fun no matter who you lose to. Beating her is not as exciting as beating someone else. I care. I care if she wins or doesn\u2019t.\u201d As she has gotten older, she has become more nervous watching Serena play. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to watch her matches,\u201d she said.Venus becomes animated when she talks about Serena. It\u2019s endearing. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a big sister,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s a great job. I don\u2019t know how little sisters feel about their job, but when you\u2019re a big sister, you\u2019re supposed to take care of everything. And you feel good about it, I do.\u201dMunching on kale chips in the EleVen conference room last Tuesday, Ms. Williams said her goal is to point out realities to people who may not be fully aware of them, and to give them a chance to do the right thing.\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone wants to look in the mirror and say, \u2018I\u2019m anti-woman,\u2019 they don\u2019t see themselves that way and you can\u2019t treat them that way,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you have to tell the truth. It\u2019s important to be respectful of the things that have been accomplished but also to acknowledge what hasn\u2019t been accomplished yet.\u201dEven she realizes she is taking on a lot, but she seems happy, incapable of idleness. \u201cI need that pressure in my life,\u201d she said. She carries with her a mind-set that tries to anticipate the next shot, the next point, the next set.\u201cI have always said that after sport, I wanted a life, I wanted an opportunity, I wanted to be able to do something,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if something happens \u2014 the economy falls out or the dollar is worthless, anything could happen \u2014 you have to be ready to work. And I\u2019m ready.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Homes and Cars Go, So Goes the Economy", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialPurchases of homes and cars are the twin pillars of the consumer economy \u2014 the starting point for other major economic activity, including taking out loans, buying insurance, paying taxes and spending on goods and services. As such, they are key measures of the depth of a recession and the strength of a recovery.A closer look at what has driven the recovery in homes and cars provides some insights into how the overall economic slowdown could still be reversed.First, neither the housing market nor the auto industry would have survived without federal efforts to stabilize and reform them. Free-market ideology to the contrary, it would have been folly to expect ruined markets to repair themselves; when the crash occurred, only federal rescue efforts could stave off harm to the broader economy.The bailouts of General Motors and Chrysler \u2014 Ford said it didn\u2019t need one \u2014 gave both companies time to get back on their feet. The housing rescue could have been more effective had it not been biased toward helping the banks and not the homeowners, an imbalance that led to more foreclosures and deeper price declines than otherwise would have been the case.Home-buying and car-buying have also been helped by the Federal Reserve policy of prolonged low interest rates. But to effectively bolster a very weak economy, low rates need to be paired with federal spending and other fiscal support. Here the Republicans have been of no help. Congress\u2019s refusal to adequately stimulate the economy by borrowing and spending while rates are low has worked at cross purposes with the Fed\u2019s efforts and done much to hold back a recovery.The latest economic report is further evidence that low interest rates alone cannot sustain even a modest recovery. Even with interest rates at very low levels, business investment decreased. The buying and renovating of homes, though strong in comparison, are slowing, too. The second quarter increase in investment in residential real estate from a year earlier was 6.2 percent, compared with 11.7 percent in the first quarter, and 13.7 percent in the last quarter of 2015. Consumer demand for cars has also leveled off, with automakers resorting to incentives and gimmicks to lift sales.The economy has been remarkably resilient. But it cannot overcome years of poor economic stewardship from Congress, which has been and remains the underlying weakness of the current economy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Argentina Plains, Hunters Feel Besieged by Critics \u2018Made of Asphalt\u2019", "Date": "2016-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUtrac\u00e1n JournalUTRAC\u00c1N, Argentina \u2014 After days in the wilderness, the hunters drove up to the sports club in rusty pickup trucks with carcasses of wild boars splayed on their roofs. One by one, the dead boars were heaved onto a bloodied crane scale, then lined up on planks, their snouts wedged open.Boar hunting in the remote, semiarid county of Utrac\u00e1n has endured for generations. Older huntsmen reminisce about their first forays into the thorny scrubland by moonlight; boys imitate their fathers\u2019 strides across vast plains as they follow packs of brawny mastiffs.Yet threats to that tradition are emerging as animal rights activists, buoyed by their growing clout in recent years, say the time has come to put an end to the hunts.\u201cPeople used to look at us like heroes,\u201d said Daniel Briguez, a 43-year-old construction site manager, who had a hunting knife strapped to his waist. \u201cToday, we\u2019re a nuisance.\u201dThe hunters bristle at such comments, saying they are under attack from critics often cocooned in distant cities.After feasting on marinated wild viscacha, a large rodent, on a recent night, Mr. Alfonso sat by the hearth of a remote farmhouse in Utrac\u00e1n, where La Pampa\u2019s crop fields and pastures begin to give way to expanses of wild lands interspersed by humble towns. His companions had gone off looking for boar tracks.With the skull of a puma looking down from the fireplace beside him, Mr. Alfonso laid out his view of the world.\u201cLa Pampa was shaped by rural men \u2014 lumberjacks clearing tracks in the forest, cattle drovers and fencers,\u201d he said, holding a hunting knife whose handle was carved from deer antlers. \u201cIf you\u2019re from the city, you\u2019re made of asphalt, sidewalks and the internet.\u201dIn many ways, Mr. Briguez epitomizes the passion of the hunters. He escapes as often as he can from the provincial capital of Santa Rosa along undulating sand tracks to hunting grounds in his 1999 Ford pickup. He will hunt through the night, then drive back home for a snooze on the sofa before another day at the construction site.The hunters, who cure much of the boar meat to eat at home, also emphasize the service they provide to the province\u2019s farmers by protecting their corn crops from foraging boars.Numbers are vague, but one study from 2009 estimated there were about 2,700 boars in just one part of Argentina\u2019s central steppe.The farmers often hire the huntsmen to cull the boars. There is a similar dynamic at play in Texas and Florida, where boars are said to have been introduced by Spanish conquistadors.\u201cThey damage both biodiversity and the agricultural economy,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Fernanda Cuevas, a biologist who researches the ecology of wild boars in Argentina. \u201cThe only solution to truly dissuade them is to hunt.\u201dBut even as supporters of hunting advance ecological as well as cultural arguments, opponents point to a tug of narratives extending beyond provincial borders.The carcasses of wild boars at a hunting tournament in Santa Rosa, La Pampa Province, Argentina.\u201cAll they see is the act of killing,\u201d said Luciano Beloqui, 35, a bearded former village mayor who prefers hunting with a telescopic rifle from stakeouts among the barbed cha\u00f1ar and piquill\u00edn shrubs.Carrying his young son in his arms, Mr. Beloqui traced a progression in villages like his, Quehu\u00e9, where he said children who used to take aim at birds with slingshots today hunt boars. As a mayor, he sought to raise awareness of the rural heritage; now, he said, \u201cWe must redouble our efforts.\u201dNow, the boar hunters fear that increasingly strict regulations imperil their tradition.For instance, a 2012 norm outlaws boar hunting for half of the year. And a new, though not enforced, rule obliges hunters to map out their routes across the province, which is roughly the size of Iowa.\u201cIt\u2019s as if we could wake up tomorrow and it\u2019d be prohibited,\u201d said Juan Carlos Cabral, 56, the long scratches on his nose attesting to a lifetime tramping through the scrubland.Mr. Cabral was helping to haul boar carcasses off the trucks near the sports club and through a parting crowd, including many women and children. Later, as some 300 hunters enjoyed a lunch of barbecued ribs and listened to live folk music, the tusks of their prey were measured to determine the winner of the main prize.As \u00c1ngel Rafael Aino, 31, a member of the winning team, straddled a dead boar and with a proud smile repeated the stabbing motion with which he had punctured its heart, some wondered how long such rituals would last.Still, observers say, hunting is too profitable an industry for the provincial authorities to ban it outright, with game reserves attracting a steady flow of tourists paying to hunt boars and red deer. The provincial government\u2019s hunting office highlighted in an email the direct and indirect revenues from all types of hunting. \u201cWe would never seek prohibition,\u201d it said.Nevertheless, fears persist and rifts are deepening among the hunters.The hunters outside the sports club, who are opposed to reserves, said they hoped future generations of hunters would be allowed to roam the flatlands despite the onslaught from critics.\u201cSharing this with my boy is the greatest thing,\u201d said Mr. Briguez, standing next to his son, Franco, 17, an aspiring veterinarian, and his hounds on a windswept plain. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of life.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But as the primary residence of the Republican nominee in the midst of a heated presidential campaign, Trump Tower holds a particularly high-profile perch.The police said they received a 911 call about the climb shortly after it began around 3:30 p.m. When they came upon Mr. Rogata, he was already five stories up, using power-grip suction cups and what appeared to be a harness to aid his ascent.On Thursday, Mr. Rogata was still at Bellevue Hospital Center, where he was taken for an evaluation after he was detained, the police said.At Trump Tower that day, four police officers, including two from a counterterrorism unit, surveyed the premises. Two private security guards stood in the lobby as tourists flowed in and out. At least seven cameras dotted the lobby and the building\u2019s exterior, in addition to those on nearby buildings and traffic lights along Fifth Avenue.A spokesman for the New York Police Department said Trump Tower had at least one police officer posted there every day, an assignment created as the election cycle has picked up during the last year. The Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment.But in a social-media-saturated world, the stunts and the outrageous images they often generate have the potential to grab attention more quickly than ever. One video stream of the Trump Tower climb, posted on Facebook, drew about 5.8 million views, with a majority of those from people tuning in while the climb was in progress.\u201cIt\u2019s so much easier to get your message out and do it live,\u201d said Glenn Corbett, a professor of security, fire and emergency management at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. \u201cBack then all you got was the nightly news.\u201dThe developer Douglas Durst spoke about the two climbers who scaled The New York Times Building on the same day in 2008. He said he had taken steps at two of his buildings \u2014 Via 57, a 32-story residential building on the West Side of Manhattan, as well as 1 World Trade Center \u2014 to discourage climbers. At Via, on 57th Street near the West Side Highway, an overhang was designed for the base of the building instead of the angular walls reaching down to the sidewalk that were initially planned.\u201cWe\u2019re now very aware of having to design buildings so they are not scalable,\u201d Mr. Durst said.Security experts described the challenge of securing large buildings as a constant push, one that involved sufficient staffing in addition to shrewd design.\u201cThere\u2019s always going to be people who are going to try to steal and commit assault, and climb buildings,\u201d said Mark Lerner, the president of Epic Security Corporation, which provides security for more than 100 buildings in New York City. \u201cYou need the proper security and personnel to act as a deterrent.\u201dThe police said Mr. Rogata told them the brazen stunt had a simple purpose: He wanted to meet Mr. Trump, a motivation that he laid out in a YouTube video that was posted before the climb. A spokeswoman for the police said they believed he had \u201csome type of mental disorder.\u201dTourists strolled by the tower on Thursday, with some stopping to snap selfies in front of it.Richard Monacchio, 50, who was in town with his 14-year-old son to see a Broadway show, said he decided to visit the tower after watching the video stream.\u201cI\u2019m surprised security didn\u2019t start running out immediately,\u201d Mr. Monacchio said of the stunt.

{"Headline": "How Millennials Became Spooked by Credit Cards", "Date": "2016-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKids these days: They just aren\u2019t pulling out the plastic like they did in the past.Data from the Federal Reserve indicates that the percentage of Americans under 35 who hold credit card debt has fallen to its lowest level since 1989, when the Fed began collecting data in a standardized way, according to an analysis by The New York Times.Some older Americans have also been shedding credit card debt since the financial crisis that began in 2008. But for no other age group has the decline in the proportion holding credit card debt been more rapid than it has been for young Americans \u2014 who are often referred to as millennials \u2014 the data from the Survey of Consumer Finances shows.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that young people are not interested in becoming indebted in the way that their parents are or were,\u201d said David Robertson, the publisher of The Nilson Report, a newsletter that tracks the payment industry.Their reluctance could have lasting repercussions for millennials, as well as for the financial system and the economy. Early use of credit cards has, in the past, helped young Americans develop a comfort level with credit that can last a lifetime and lead to a succession of big purchases financed by debt. Without a substantial credit history, it is much harder to take out a home mortgage, for example.\u201cIt will probably take them longer to get access to credit,\u201d said Gregory Elliehausen, an economist at the Federal Reserve specializing in consumer finance. \u201cIn the meantime, their behavior and some of their habits will have already been formed.\u201dOver all, Americans\u2019 use of credit cards has recently been creeping up again: Household debt in the United States increased by $35 billion, to $12.29 trillion, during the second quarter of 2016, a 0.3 percent rise from the previous quarter that was driven by credit cards and auto loans, according to a report released on Tuesday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Banks say that their credit card operations are running at full tilt, and that in recent months the number of people having trouble paying their bills has been at record lows.But many younger people have been sitting on the sidelines, deterred by new laws passed after the crisis and big loads of student debt. They are also spooked by the temptation that credit cards offer to spend beyond one\u2019s means.Jason Towner, a 32-year-old who works at a private equity firm, cut up his last credit card, from Capital One, in 2010. He did not have any unruly debts, but he had just watched his father and sister close the family furniture store after a bank cut off their credit line in the middle of the financial crisis.\u201cI was seeing what was happening around the world, and what was happening in my backyard, and I was thinking, \u2018This is not a great idea,\u2019\u201d Mr. Towner said recently.The resurgence of overall credit card use in the United States over the last year or two has been driven largely by subprime borrowers, according to the Federal Reserve, which has not looked at the recent growth in borrowing by age.But it is clear to economists who study payment patterns that millennials are gravitating toward payment methods that skirt both cash and credit. Why carry cash when you can whip out a debit card for the smallest transaction \u2014 a sandwich or a bottle of soda \u2014 or use an app like Venmo or an online payment service like PayPal? All of those typically draw funds directly from a bank account.Mr. Elliehausen of the Federal Reserve said he expected the aversion to debt among young Americans to continue, potentially with a downside. Credit cards are frequently necessary for the bigger purchases \u2014 like washing machines and computers \u2014 that can make households more efficient and help the economy grow. And credit cards are usually an essential part of the credit history that allows someone to borrow to buy a house.Only 37 percent of American households headed by someone aged 35 and under held credit card debt in 2013, the most recent year for which data from the Survey of Consumer Finances is available, down by nearly a quarter from immediately before the financial crisis. That statistic may undercount young cardholders to some extent, as it excludes people under 35 who live with their parents.But more recent data has also suggested that millennials are using credit cards less than people of a similar age did in the past \u2014 and that they are taking on fewer auto loans and mortgage loans than people of similar age did before the financial crisis.Rebecca Liebman, 23, graduated from Clark University in 2015 with a load of student debt. She avoided getting a credit card until earlier this year, and did so then only because she kept hearing about how she would need to build up her credit history if she ever hoped to get a mortgage.\u201cI don\u2019t want to use a credit card irresponsibly, and because of that, it\u2019s scarier to use,\u201d she said. \u201cI grew up \u2014 I saw 2008 \u2014 I saw my dad get laid off. I don\u2019t trust the financial market.\u201dToday Ms. Liebman is a founder of a financial literacy site for millennials, LearnLux, and the reluctant holder of a Discover card. Even after getting the card, it took her five months to overcome her ingrained aversion to debt and make her first purchase \u2014 a physical wallet.She understands what the aversion will mean for her and for her customers.\u201cIt\u2019s going to make me buy a home a lot later in life,\u201d Ms. Liebman said. \u201cI think it will impact a lot of big decisions and push them further out. There are some things that are going to be specific to our generation around financial decision-making for sure.\u201dThe reasons for the shift are varied: Like Ms. Liebman, many young people carry burdensome loads of student debt, making it hard for them to take on any more debt \u2014 and giving them a sour taste in their mouths when it comes to credit of any sort. The average American under 35 now has $17,200 of student debt, 182 percent more than Americans of the same age had in 1995, the Fed data shows.On a more practical level, laws passed after the financial crisis made it much harder for younger people to secure cards unless they could prove they had the income to pay the bills. The tents that credit card companies used to pitch all over college campuses \u2014 offering students free T-shirts when they signed up for cards \u2014 have largely disappeared.Then there are the young professionals who are able to get a card, but have seen the strain that debt put on their families and friends during the financial crisis.Mr. Towner, whose job in private equity involves lending money to small businesses, is a prime example. To him, the risks involved with debt outweigh the benefits, so he tends to use Venmo and PayPal, or, whenever possible, cash. When he bought his apartment in Berkeley, Calif., he chose a foreclosure and paid with money he had in the bank.\u201cI don\u2019t want to go out and buy, buy, buy, even though that\u2019s what society wants me to do,\u201d Mr. Towner said. \u201cI want to save and invest for the long term.\u201dAn article on Monday about the reluctance of millennials to take on credit card debt misidentified the university from which one such person, Rebecca Liebman, graduated. She received a degree from Clark University, not Bentley University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trading Stocks for Bonds Poses Its Own Risks", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRetiringFOR those in or near retirement, the standard investing advice has long been to dump stocks gradually and load up on bonds as you get older. The idea is to reduce the risk that a big stock market decline will wipe out much of your portfolio just when you need the money most.But in an era of ultralow bond yields and longer retirements, does the conventional wisdom need to be seriously challenged? Perhaps there\u2019s a greater risk, after all, that you will outlive your savings and that even a low inflation rate will erode the value of your investments over time if they are not growing with the economy.Chris Brightman, chief investment officer at Research Affiliates, wrote in a recent report: \u201cThese negative real rates of interest paid by an increasing proportion of the developed world\u2019s governments on their debt will not preserve our purchasing power over the long run, let alone generate the growth in real wealth necessary to achieve our investment objectives.\u201dVolatility also spooks retirement investors into doing the wrong thing at the wrong time. According to new research by Fidelity Investments, \u201clong-term investors tended to lower their stock investments during major short-term stock market declines, rather than adhering to an approach that is based on a well-thought-out, long-term investment plan.\u201dMost investors don\u2019t make multiple-decade portfolio projections, of course, but consider that many people are going to spend 30 years or more in retirement. A long-term perspective is essential.Sarah Newcomb, a behavioral economist for Morningstar, wanted to know for herself how much the cost of living was likely to increase over time \u2014 and whether her portfolio could keep up with inflation.\u201cI learned that with an average 3 percent inflation rate, prices double every 24 years,\u201d said Ms. Newcomb, who is also author of \u201cLoaded: Money, Psychology and How to Get Ahead Without Leaving Your Values Behind\u201d (Wiley, 2016).\u201cThat means that by the time I retire, my life will cost twice as much as it does now, and if I make it to my late 80s, the same lifestyle will cost four times as much then as it does today,\u201d Ms. Newcomb added. \u201cIf I am not actively saving and aggressively investing, the real risk is the risk of not retiring at all.\u201dIt\u2019s only natural to err on the side of caution when investing for retirement. After all, remembering the huge sell-off in 2008 and facing the recent volatility from the so-called Brexit vote makes millions of investors anxious. Yet they can easily take too little risk and become myopic on the erosion from inflation. Sitting on cash or holding long-term bonds isn\u2019t the answer to this perennial problem.\u201cAn adviser recently told me about a client who was left with tens of millions of dollars after the death of her husband,\u201d Ms. Newcomb said. \u201cThis woman is terrified of mishandling his money, and so she refuses to invest. The decision to keep money \u2018safe\u2019 in cash and cash equivalents guarantees a financial loss in the form of inflation.\u201dIn addition to the overall rise in the cost of living, older Americans face the likelihood that they will ultimately have to pay for some form of long-term care. Seventy percent of Americans over age 65 will need nursing, custodial or in-home care services, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.Like many health care expenses, long-term care costs are rising faster than the consumer inflation rate. Expenses for a private nursing home room, for example, rose at a 3.5 percent rate from 2011 through 2015, according to Genworth, an insurance company, compared to a current inflation rate of little more than 1 percent. The median cost of a private room is now nearly $100,000 a year.\u201cI\u2019m very concerned about long-term care risk,\u201d says Anna Rappaport, an actuarial consultant who focuses on retirement issues. \u201cA lot of people aren\u2019t focused on the long term.\u201dTo build a portfolio that will grow well ahead of the pace of inflation over the long-term means relying more on stocks that will combine growth and dividends.But even as you take more risk, you have to take a hard look at your psychology. Assess how much of a decline in the value of your portfolio you are willing to accept.\u201cIf your portfolio is down 20 percent to 30 percent, would it impact your lifestyle or could you work through it?\u201d asks Judith B. Ward, a senior certified financial planner for T. Rowe Price, the mutual fund firm.For most people, though, taking on more long-term risk doesn\u2019t mean chasing short-term gains and trading frequently.Ms. Newcomb said she had met a man on a plane who owned two small businesses but who was now trading in commodities, a highly risky endeavor that he failed to master. He asked for advice.\u201cChasing short-term returns is rarely a sound strategy for building long-term income,\u201d Ms. Newcomb said she told the man. \u201cUnless he could predict tomorrow\u2019s headlines, he needed to put more of his money to work in less speculative investments.\u201dThere are two routes to finding a workable marriage between portfolio risk and needed returns.One simple way is to run an online program to see whether your current portfolio is likely to provide enough money over time given a certain rate of return, mix of investments and your age.A \u201cMonte Carlo analysis,\u201d one of those programs, will show how long your portfolio can be expected to last. It\u2019s not a precise science, of course, since most free calculators don\u2019t allow you to include items like emergencies, long-term care or other sudden health expenses. Uncertainty is inherent in the process.Ask these professionals to run a portfolio review. They should spend time vetting your concerns, goals, legacy plans and fears. At the very least, they should be able to tailor a portfolio that conforms to your goals and concerns.Professional advisers should ask detailed questions about risk tolerance and objectives. For example: Are you prepared for long-term and out-of-pocket health care expenses? Do you plan any major lifestyle changes that will alter your spending plan? Can you cut expenses if you need to without sacrificing quality of life?Also ask advisers to identify the various types of investment risks. You can overconcentrate, for example, in one type of asset, like American stocks or bonds. That means you may be underdiversified in global companies.Or you could be overexposed in real estate or your employer\u2019s stock. Spreading your money between a diversified portfolio, primarily in stocks but also including bonds, real estate and other investments, is usually the most prudent course.In any enlightened approach, you are likely to face the decision of refocusing your portfolio to meet your needs down the road. In doing so, remember that the real risk is not doing enough to make sure your money lasts as long as you do.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Cost of Political Instability in Nepal", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialLast week, Nepal\u2019s Parliament elected Pushpa Kamal Dahal as prime minister, in the country\u2019s 25th change in leadership in 26 years. Mr. Dahal\u2019s predecessor, K. P. Sharma Oli, resigned last month after only nine months in office.Political instability is harming Nepal\u2019s struggling economy, which is expected to grow only 1.5 percent this year, and threatens to stall further relief for victims of last year\u2019s devastating earthquake.Unfortunately, there is little hope for stable governance in the near future. Mr. Dahal, under a power-sharing agreement between his Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist-Center) and the Nepali Congress party, will serve as prime minister for nine months, after which power will pass to Sher Bahadur Deuba, chairman of the Nepali Congress party, for nine months. That transition could well add to the political turmoil involving disputes over Nepal\u2019s new Constitution, which was approved by the Parliament last September, and jockeying between Nepal\u2019s powerful neighbors, India and China.Mr. Oli, who was elected prime minister last October during a period of public anger toward India over the trade issue, maintained a hard line toward India, and made building relations with China a priority. On Sunday, he warned India against \u201cunnatural meddling\u201d in Nepal\u2019s affairs, and said his party, the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist), would fight any attempts to reverse agreements he had signed with China, including a transit and trade pact. So far, both India and China have expressed support for Mr. Dahal\u2019s new government.Mr. Dahal, a former Maoist rebel leader who was prime minister from August 2008 to May 2009, has promised to address Madhesi demands, though he hailed the passage of the Constitution in its current form last fall as \u201ca victory of the dreams of the thousands of martyrs and disappeared fighters\u201d of the Maoist insurgency. He will have to move quickly to organize local elections, paving the way for national and provincial elections under Mr. Deuba\u2019s watch, and preparing the ground for constitutional changes to accommodate Madhesi demands.Meanwhile, $4.1 billion in foreign grants and soft loans have yet to be disbursed to victims of last year\u2019s earthquake. Some 770,000 Nepalese households will most likely have to go through another winter in temporary structures. While Nepal\u2019s political leaders are embroiled in interminable fights, the country\u2019s needs are going unaddressed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump a Working-Class Hero? A Blue-Collar Town Debates His Credentials", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "The talk gets heated in Youngstown, Ohio, when residents discuss whether a New York billionaire\u2019s ideas can revitalize a struggling Rust Belt town.Supported byYOUNGSTOWN, Ohio \u2014 \u201cIs this idiot for Trump?\u201d Mark Wasko asked, his voice booming across the parking lot of an out-of-business supermarket.It was a late weekday morning in a troubled, shrinking Rust Belt city that is fed up with being known as a troubled, shrinking Rust Belt city. The man Mr. Wasko was calling an idiot \u2014 perhaps seriously, or playfully, or both \u2014 was his friend Vincent Archangelo Strines.Mr. Wasko, 48, had seen Mr. Strines, 55, a beefy blond man with a pack of cigarillos in his breast pocket, sitting behind a folding table and selling raffle tickets to support his nonprofit addiction recovery organization. So Mr. Wasko had parked his big soda truck in the lot and hopped out. He was appalled to learn that his friend, normally a Democratic voter, was now supporting Donald J. Trump.He looked Mr. Strines in the eye. \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot,\u201d he declared.Youngstown is the kind of blue-collar Midwestern stronghold where Mr. Trump\u2019s struggling campaign must make a strong showing, particularly among white voters, if he is to have any chance of winning the presidential election. Broaching the topic of Mr. Trump on a street corner or bar stool here \u2014 and thus delving into matters of race, economics, immigration and the still-painful matter of the city\u2019s disintegration \u2014 can be a volatile business.\u201cIf you want to punch me in the face, do it,\u201d Mr. Strines dared Mr. Wasko casually, after about 15 minutes of debate that played out under a billboard for a nearby adult novelty store called Sassy Sensations and touched on all of those issues.Cars whooshed up and down Mahoning Avenue, past businesses shuttered or struggling, and past tired residential side streets now considered \u201cfood deserts\u201d since the grocery store, a Sparkle Market, closed down about four years ago. Youngstown, a city of about 65,000 people, is about 60 percent smaller than it was in 1960. Decades ago, blacks, Irish, Italians and Eastern Europeans came to work among the great blast furnaces of the old mills. When those businesses closed between 1977 and 1982, tens of thousands lost their jobs.Today there are still some metal industry and manufacturing jobs. There is a big General Motors plant north of town that produces the small Chevrolet Cruze sedan. There is a maximum-security prison that opened in 1998. There is a business incubator, focused on reimagining Youngstown as a hub for software and 3-D printing.In addition, there are signs of recovery from the Great Recession: The unemployment rate, which peaked at nearly 17 percent in January 2010, stood at 7.6 percent in June.There is also a widespread belief that Mr. Trump is right when he says that the United States must renegotiate the terms of its trade with the world.Mr. Strines said that he worked for years as a quality assurance superintendent in the aluminum business, making good money until health issues related to his drinking problem forced him to retire. In that time, he said, he saw many businesses go under because China could produce aluminum for a fraction of what it cost American companies. He is hoping Mr. Trump will institute more protective tariffs.\u201cI think he could bring the economy back,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a take-charge kind of guy.\u201dMr. Wasko huffed. He doubted that Mr. Trump would follow through on any of his promises. What about the border wall? Mr. Trump was never going to get Mexico to pay for that, he said. And anyhow, wasn\u2019t America great already?Mr. Strines said: \u201cYou think America is great? Come look for a job in Youngstown.\u2019\u2019Wendy Aron, 58, emerged from the speech energized. She was once a supporter of President Obama but was dismayed by the weakness of the post-recession recovery. Her housecleaning business in the Youngstown suburb of Boardman has shrunk, going from a dozen employees to a two-person operation: her and her daughter. Working people, she said, don\u2019t have the money to pay for maid service anymore.Many of her close friends remain Democrats. \u201cThey just put me down,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to even talk to them.\u201dGayle Hite, an employee at a hospital, and her husband, Joseph, were not invited to the speech, but got as close to it as they could, waiting outside a campus building with her wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d T-shirt.She is a longtime Republican, but her husband, who usually votes Democrat, was planning to vote for Mr. Trump this year. They had watched Mr. Trump slog through a tough couple of weeks, taking criticism for, among other things, his feud with the family of a slain Muslim American soldier. But what some saw as gaffes were, to Mr. Hite, proof that Mr. Trump was a true change agent.\u201cHe\u2019s not bought or sold by anybody,\u201d said Mr. Hite, a retired corrections officer. \u201cHe can say what he wants.\u201dThese days Mr. Hite, 64, receives a Social Security check, but he said he worried about the ways in which a volatile world might bankrupt the government. What would it cost to absorb Syrian refugees? And the immigrants coming across the Mexican border?\u201cIt shows we\u2019re not really running our country,\u201d Ms. Hite said. \u201cSometimes I don\u2019t believe our vote counts.\u201dIn Mr. Springsteen\u2019s song \u201cYoungstown,\u201d the narrator, a laid-off mill worker, wishes for a future not in heaven but in \u201cthe fiery furnaces of hell.\u201d The character was inspired, in part, by a real steelworker, Joe Marshall Jr., whom Mr. Springsteen had read about in a book.Today Mr. Marshall, a small, sturdy man, who turns 63 on Saturday, can be found in Columbus, living in a $500 apartment and drawing a full state pension. After the steel industry fell apart, he pursued a life in law enforcement. He is an ardent Trump supporter.\u201cHe says what the average person is afraid to say because it\u2019s politically incorrect,\u201d Mr. Marshall said about Mr. Trump.Mr. Marshall worked at the Mahoning County Sheriff\u2019s Office for 23 years, at the jail and on patrol \u2014 a front-row seat, he said, to the city\u2019s dramatic decline. He watched as the professional classes emptied out, and as the city\u2019s complexion changed: Youngstown, 74 percent white in 1970, is now about evenly divided between blacks and whites.Drugs came in, he said. The murder rate soared. Young people were dropping out of school at 15 years of age, Mr. Marshall said, because they didn\u2019t see what kinds of work a degree would get them.\u201cWhere are they going to go, Taco Bell?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat\u2019s minimum-wage jobs.\u201dSeven years ago, he moved away, taking a job as a corrections officer. Today, his political views are eclectic. The Democrats, he said, \u201cfailed Youngstown\u201d: During the steel days, they were the party of overbearing regulations, the ones who told management that they couldn\u2019t open a second blast furnace. \u201cThat\u2019s jobs they took away,\u201d he said.On Facebook, Mr. Marshall\u2019s posts extol the beauty of mixed-race families, and the contributions of African-Americans to the country\u2019s culture. But he is wary of the big mosque in his neighborhood and suspects Muslims there of planning an attack. The Democrats, he said, seem indifferent to whites.\u201cBelieve me, as Jesus Christ is my lord and savior, I\u2019m not prejudiced or anything,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it seems if you\u2019re a minority, they help you out a lot more than if you\u2019re white.\u201d\u201cHe was a good guy,\u201d Mr. Marshall said of Mr. Traficant, who had hired him personally. \u201cI remember he told me, \u2018You screw up, Marshall, I\u2019ll kill you.\u2019\u201dLike Mr. Trump, Mr. Traficant, who went by the nickname Jimbo, annoyed and defied members of both parties, dished out scathing personal insults, blasted Washington insiders and purported to speak for the average Joe. He proposed sending troops to secure the Mexican border and criticized free trade. He even sported a flamboyant and gravity-defying hairdo, though it proved to be a toupee.Back in Youngstown, the fondness for Mr. Traficant lingers despite allegations that he was tied to the mob.\u201cWell, the whole city was like that,\u201d said Kathy Miller, the Trump campaign coordinator for Mahoning County. She said it was difficult to agree with everything Mr. Traficant did, just as it is with Mr. Trump. But she said that Mr. Traficant\u2019s constituent services were unparalleled.\u201cJimbo got it taken care of,\u201d she said.Out in the parking lot, Mr. Strines seconded the praise. \u201cHe just told it the way it was, and I think Trump is the same type of guy as Traficant,\u201d he said.Mr. Strines even asserted that Youngstown had been a better, safer place when the mob was in control. So it would be, he said, in Mr. Trump\u2019s America.Once upon a time, he said, everybody in Youngstown knew that if someone messed up and failed to follow certain rules, \u201cthat\u2019s where the mob would step in.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s where Trump would step in,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce somebody\u2019s got fear, like Iraq will have, like China will have,\u201d he said, the world will grow calmer. \u201cAll of those illegal aliens better pack up their toothbrushes and start running.\u201dMr. Wasko wasn\u2019t buying it: \u201cSo let\u2019s instill fear in everyone in America,\u201d he said sarcastically.\u201cNo,\u201d Mr. Strines said, \u201conly the bad ones, man.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Hillary Clinton Seeks to Explain", "Date": "2016-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Hillary Clinton on Friday sought to explain her recent mischaracterization of the F.B.I. investigation into her private email server, saying she \u201cmay have short-circuited\u201d in her remarks during a television interview on Sunday when she asserted that the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, had called her statements about her private email servers \u201ctruthful.\u201dMrs. Clinton made the remarks while taking her most extensive questions from journalists in months \u2014 after going more than 200 days without holding a formal news conference.In her remarks here before the National Association of Black Journalists and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, Mrs. Clinton tried to explain the discrepancy with what Mr. Comey actually said.\u201cI was pointing out in both of those instances that Director Comey had said that my answers in my F.B.I. interview were truthful,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s really the bottom line here.\u201dMrs. Clinton reiterated her explanation that the classified emails the F.B.I. had identified as having passed over her private server were not marked classified at the time.The explanation did not appease Republicans.\u201cIt\u2019s not hard to see why she hasn\u2019t held a press conference in 244 days,\u201d said the Republican National Committee chairman, Reince Priebus. \u201cHillary Clinton is once again proving herself incapable of telling the truth.\u201dDuring her remarks, Mrs. Clinton said she took \u201cseriously\u201d the problems she has had winning voters\u2019 trust.Questioned about why a majority of voters do not trust her, Mrs. Clinton referred to her high approval ratings when she was secretary of state and a senator from New York.\u201cWere 67 percent of the people in New York wrong?

Trump\u2019s supporters should be taken seriously.14 PhotosWhen asked about what Mr. Trump\u2019s millions of supporters, who are often drawn to language she and others have called racist and sexist, says about the electorate, Mrs. Clinton said that while some people were backing the businessman because of his \u201cbigotry,\u201d she acknowledged that many were motivated by economic hardships.\u201cWe have to recognize that of course some of the appeal is xenophobic and racist and misogynistic and offensive,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to acknowledge that \u2014 but let\u2019s not lose sight of the real pain that many of Americans are feeling because the economy has left them behind.\u201dMrs. Clinton also criticized Mr. Trump on Friday as someone who would be a dangerous president and stressed that if elected, she would work on issues related to systemic racism and the economy that often hit black and Hispanic communities the hardest.\u201cHe is harkening back to the most shameful chapters of our history and appealing to the ugliest impulses of our society,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to stand up as a country and say that Donald Trump doesn\u2019t represent who we are and what we believe.\u201dMrs. Clinton also vowed to push hard to pass a comprehensive immigration overhaul bill with a path toward citizenship for those in the country illegally, and said she would prioritize the issue during her first 100 days in office.Mrs. Clinton joins a long list of political leaders who have spoken at the groups\u2019 conventions, which often focus on increasing diversity in newsrooms. President Obama, former President Bill Clinton, former president George W. Bush, Bob Dole and former Vice President Al Gore have all addressed past conventions. The groups invited Mr. Trump to speak, but he declined, according to the organizers.Before taking questions, Mrs. Clinton delivered a 15-minute address focused mostly on how her plans to improve the economy would especially benefit blacks and Latinos. \u201cRosa Parks opened up every seat on the bus,\u201d she said. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got to open up every opportunity.\u201dHovering over the address was the image of Mrs. Clinton addressing a room full of journalists. Although she occasionally holds informal sessions with the news media on campaign stops, Clinton aides have spent months explaining why she hasn\u2019t held an official news conference, as most candidates, particularly Mr. Trump, do regularly.\u201cWe\u2019ll have a press conference when we want to have a press conference,\u201d Joel Benenson, the campaign\u2019s chief strategist and pollster, told ABC News last month.She even had some words of encouragement for the Fourth Estate: \u201cWe need you to keep holding leaders and candidates accountable,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told the hundreds of journalists attending the five-day conference here of the National Association of Black Journalists and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists.Near the end of the event, Mrs. Clinton talked about her African-American girlfriends, whom she rarely mentions in public. Asked what the most meaningful conversation she has had with one of them, she said she was \u201cblessed to have a crew of great friends.\u201d These include some of her most senior aides, including Cheryl D. Mills, Maggie Williams and Minyon Moore.\u201cI can\u2019t compress it into one conversation,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cThey\u2019ve supported me. They\u2019ve chastised me. They\u2019ve raised issues with me.\u201dYamiche Alcindor reported from Washington, and Amy Chozick from New York.Yamiche Alcindor reported from Washington, and Amy Chozick from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Edward Snowden\u2019s Long, Strange Journey to Hollywood", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "FeatureOliver Stone wanted a hit \u2014 and the chance to put America\u2019s most iconic dissident onscreen. The subject wanted veto power. The Russian lawyer wanted someone to option the novel he\u2019d written. The American lawyer just wanted the whole insane project to go away. Somehow a film got made.Supported by\u201cI think we should move,\u201d he said. His producer, Moritz Borman, led the way to another corner. \u201cHow\u2019s this?\u201d Borman asked.Stone didn\u2019t answer. He eyed an older couple slurping soup and kept moving. A moment later, Stone finally settled in by a window, comfortably beyond earshot of the other patrons.Such security precautions had become routine. Ever since Stone decided to make a biopic about Edward Snowden, the American whistle-\u00adblower currently holed up in Moscow somewhere, the director \u2014 who became a Buddhist while making \u201cHeaven & Earth\u201d and sampled a buffet of psychedelic drugs for \u201cThe Doors\u201d \u2014 had gone all method again. On \u201cSnowden,\u201d he and Borman became so preoccupied with American government surveillance that they had their Los Angeles offices swept for bugs more than once.The director hadn\u2019t been sleeping well. Principal photography wrapped a month earlier, and now Stone had come to Moscow to film Snowden for the movie\u2019s grand finale. He ordered a decaf coffee and began to lay out the events that led him and Borman to be hanging out in Russian hotels, on the lookout for potential spies. \u201cLast January, Moritz calls me,\u201d Stone said. \u201cHe says: \u2018You got a call from this fella who represents Mr. Snowden. You\u2019re invited to Moscow.\u2019\u2009\u201dThe call had come from Anatoly Kucherena, Snowden\u2019s Russian lawyer. In the course of his career, Kucherena has represented Russian oligarchs, film directors, a few pop singers and a state minister. In 2012, he campaigned for Vladimir V. Putin, and soon after Snowden landed in Moscow, Kucherena showed up at Sheremetyevo Airport and offered his services. Then Kucherena wrote a novel about his new client. Titled \u201cTime of the Octopus,\u201d it follows a National Security Agency leaker named Joshua Cold who is marooned in the airport and the Russian advocate who liberates him. In January 2014, months before the book was published, Kucherena called Borman to see if Stone might like to make it into a Hollywood movie.\u201cAnd I know you from working on, what, three films?\u201d Stone said at the bar.\u201cFive,\u201d Borman said.At the time, Stone and Borman were barely speaking after a falling-\u00adout during the making of \u201cSavages,\u201d a beachy Blake Lively thriller. \u201cWe\u2019ve had our fights,\u201d Stone said. \u201cYou know, he\u2019s German; I\u2019m American.\u201d He didn\u2019t elaborate.\u201cHe calls, and I go: \u2018Oh, [expletive]. Not again,\u2019\u2009\u201d Stone continued. It wasn\u2019t just about Borman. Stone wanted nothing to do with another political docudrama. He spent two decades trying to get a biopic about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. off the ground, only to see \u201cSelma\u201d get made to critical acclaim. Then there was the My Lai massacre film. Merrill Lynch put up cash, Bruce Willis was set to star and Stone built an entire village in Thailand. As the economy collapsed in 2008, the financing evaporated. \u201cYou get these scars, and they don\u2019t go away,\u201d Stone said.So Stone was skeptical. But this was Snowden, who single-\u00adhandedly exposed the colossal scale on which the United States had been surveilling its citizens. Plus, the director needed a hit. After early successes like \u201cPlatoon\u201d and \u201cWall Street,\u201d his more recent films didn\u2019t receive the attention he hoped. The Snowden story had all the ingredients of an epic Stone picture: politics, government conspiracy and, at the center of it all, an American patriot who had lost faith. If it panned out, it could be Stone\u2019s millennial follow-\u00adup to \u201cBorn on the Fourth of July,\u201d the Ron Kovic biopic that won him an Oscar in 1990.But first Stone and Borman had to make sure Kucherena was for real. Borman asked the lawyer to send the book and two first-class tickets to Moscow. Both arrived the next day. In case they still had doubts, Kucherena\u2019s office gave Borman a number to call. On the other end was an employee of the Russian consulate in San Francisco, who turned out to be a big fan of \u201cThe Life of David Gale,\u201d a film Borman produced. They were issued visas that same week. (Kucherena denies buying first-class tickets for Stone and Borman or helping expedite their visas.)\u201cWhen that happened,\u201d Borman said, \u201cI thought, O.K., I guess Kucherena can pull the strings.\u201dThe initial revelations were sensational. Not only had the N.S.A. been monitoring the calls, emails and web activity of millions of Americans, but it also had been tapping into the networks of Google, Yahoo and other companies to do so. The Guardian published the leaks, and Greenwald eventually revealed the identity of his source in a video shot by Poitras. Depending on your feelings about national security, the N.S.A.\u2019s actions were either necessary or unconstitutional. The Apple co-\u00adfounder Steve Wozniak called Snowden a hero. Secretary of State John Kerry called him a traitor. Donald Trump called for his execution.As Snowden became a celebrity, a cause and a historical event, the web of people who wanted to take part in it widened. Most had his best interests in mind, but his story also happened to advance agendas that had long needed an appealing spokesperson. Civil-\u00adliberties lawyers wanted to represent him. Activist journalists wanted access to him. Publishers rushed out books, including \u201cThe Snowden Files: The Inside Story of the World\u2019s Most Wanted Man,\u201d by Luke Harding of The Guardian, and \u201cThe Snowden Operation: Inside the West\u2019s Greatest Intelligence Disaster,\u201d by Edward Lucas of The Economist. Despite promising an \u201cinside\u201d look, neither writer had ever met Snowden.Those with intimate knowledge documented the experience, too. In 2014, Greenwald published \u201cNo Place to Hide: Edward Snowden, the N.S.A. and the U.S. Surveillance State,\u201d a dramatic retelling of how Greenwald broke the story. That fall, Poitras released \u201cCitizenfour,\u201d a tense and spooky documentary about a modest and intelligent young man who hid under a blanket when typing on his laptop. (It won the 2015 Oscar for best documentary.)Snowden, meanwhile, ended up in Russia. He had embarked on a trip to Ecuador, but the United States revoked his passport midflight, leaving him stranded in Moscow. For Russia, Snowden was like a bird that flew in through an open window \u2014 or, as Putin joked, an unwanted Christmas present. But politically speaking, he could be useful. After enduring the United States\u2019 endless lectures about human rights, the Kremlin could suddenly welcome a man who exposed large-scale American hypocrisy.Kucherena entered the picture as Snowden\u2019s lifeline, or at least as someone who could help him navigate Russia\u2019s asylum laws. An experienced lawyer, Kucherena was appointed by Putin to the Public Council, overseeing the Federal Security Service (F.S.B.). Snowden\u2019s case presented a new opportunity. It took Kucherena a month to negotiate Snowden\u2019s stay and three months to write \u201cTime of the Octopus.\u201dStone\u2019s first meeting with Kucherena was a disaster. (\u201cI thought he was a gruff bear,\u201d Stone told me.) The director wanted to meet Snowden, but Kucherena said Snowden wouldn\u2019t meet them until they agreed to option \u201cTime of the Octopus.\u201d (Kucherena denies this.) According to Stone and Borman, by the end of a long weekend, they reached a gentlemen\u2019s agreement: Stone would option the novel \u2014 if Kucherena could provide regular access to his client.During those 24 hours, this magazine had contacted Ben Wizner, Snowden\u2019s lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union, to arrange an interview with his client. Kucherena may be Snowden\u2019s Russian representative, but in the United States, Wizner runs the show. Wizner was furious. Not just because Stone had invited a reporter to Moscow, but because of how it all looked: that Snowden was involved in a Hollywood movie and that the whole production was seemingly brokered by a lawyer with ties to the Kremlin. Borman would later tell me that we had waded into the sticky territory of Snowden\u2019s multiple emissaries. \u201cThere are two ways to access him: One is Kucherena and one is Wizner, and it\u2019s completely political,\u201d Borman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a political situation that goes way above your head.\u201dWhen Wizner and I finally got on the phone, he was in damage-\u00adcontrol mode. He told me that Snowden wasn\u2019t profiting from Stone\u2019s film in any way. \u201cOne hard-and-fast rule Ed always had was, I\u2019m not selling my life rights,\u201d Wizner said. Snowden\u2019s participation in a Hollywood movie would only fuel the claims of his critics \u2014 that he was a narcissist eager to cash in. That said, Stone\u2019s film would be seen by millions of people, which meant it could sway public opinion. \u201cWe were choosing between two bad options,\u201d Wizner said. \u201cHe could have stubbornly stayed completely at arm\u2019s length and had no input whatsoever. Or he could have some input and compromised the arm\u2019s-length relationship. And I didn\u2019t know how to advise him on that.\u201dAccording to Wizner, Snowden met with Stone only to make sure that the film told an accurate story. \u201cIt\u2019s been us walking this tightrope between clearly not having any formal connection to the project \u2014 not deriving any benefit from it \u2014 and also not wanting to just be completely helpless and, you know, see what Oliver Stone comes up with,\u201d Wizner said. Despite some initial discomfort, he was tentatively optimistic. \u201cMaybe it\u2019ll be good,\u201d Wizner added. \u201cYou know, Oliver Stone wrote \u2018Scarface.\u2019\u2009\u201dStill, Stone was heading to Moscow to film Snowden for an appearance in the movie, which could be seen as an endorsement. Fact-\u00adchecking is one thing, I said; a cameo is another. \u201cIt is, and I\u2019m not entirely comfortable with it,\u201d Wizner said.Wizner had negotiated veto control over any footage featuring Snowden in the film. After we spoke, the lawyer says he asked Borman to put that in writing. He also reiterated that if Stone took a reporter along, Snowden would not participate. Stone and I eventually reached a compromise: I wouldn\u2019t observe the shoot, but I could still come and meet Kucherena.A few days later, I met Stone in Moscow. The director, who is 69, has a forward-\u00adleaning gait and unruly eyebrows, so that he looks a bit like a bull that is always about to charge. He emerged from the hotel\u2019s elevator with a pained look on his face. It was drizzling, and Stone\u2019s hair, which is the color of dark shoe polish, was pointing laterally. \u201cI have some bad news,\u201d he said. \u201cI cannot deliver Anatoly.\u201d He had just seen Snowden, who had been in touch with Wizner and was very upset, Stone said. \u201cEd said he doesn\u2019t want Anatoly talking to you, and he said that very clearly,\u201d Stone added.I would spend the next few days camped out at the hotel. When Stone wasn\u2019t shooting, we would meet in the lobby bar as he continued to tell me about the making of his film.Soon after optioning Kucherena\u2019s novel, Stone had returned to Moscow with his co-\u00adwriter, Kieran Fitzgerald, a recent University of Texas M.F.A. graduate. Anticipating a homesick Snowden, Fitzgerald hauled over a duffel bag packed with the stuff of Americana dreams: Kraft macaroni and cheese, \u00adJell-O cups, Oreos, Pepperidge Farm cookies, Twizzlers, peanut butter, Spam, an Orioles baseball cap and a pair of Converse sneakers. \u201cIt was like delivering a care package to a kid at summer camp,\u201d Fitzgerald told me. He also slipped in a copy of \u201cThe Odyssey\u201d translated by his grandfather, Robert Fitzgerald. \u201cI thought it was appropriate, since Ed was on his own kind of odyssey trying to get home.\u201dSnowden and Stone had gotten off to a slow start. Snowden was squeamish about a movie being made about his life. Stone, in turn, said the film would be made with or without him. Fitzgerald says he played referee. \u201cOliver can be a bit of battering ram,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cHe\u2019s accustomed to hard men who need to be cracked, but that\u2019s not Edward Snowden. He\u2019s not an alpha-\u00admale type. He\u2019s a very sensitive mind. So I was there to say: \u2018Everything is going to be O.K. He\u2019s a good guy. It\u2019s going to be a good movie.\u2019\u2009\u201d Eventually, Snowden began to open up, answering questions about his childhood; his girlfriend, Lindsay Mills; and what he could about his work for the N.S.A.While Fitzgerald returned to Austin to work on the script, Stone set out to plant his flag in the Snowden story. In Hollywood, book options are the equivalent of calling dibs, and Stone had competition. In May 2014, Sony Pictures optioned Greenwald\u2019s \u201cNo Place to Hide.\u201d By June, Stone had announced that he acquired Kucherena\u2019s book and Harding\u2019s \u201cThe Snowden Files.\u201d The tactic worked. Sony got nervous. \u201cNow what?\u201d Amy Pascal, then Sony\u2019s co-\u00adchairwoman, wrote to another executive. (The email would be leaked during the Sony hack.) Pascal\u2019s colleague reminded her of the case of the dual Steve Jobs biopics \u2014 \u201cJobs,\u201d with Ashton Kutcher, might have come out first, but it was \u201cSteve Jobs,\u201d starring Michael Fassbender, that was the better film. Pascal wasn\u2019t convinced. \u201cOliver Stone is not Ashton Kutcher,\u201d she responded. She wrote to George Clooney to pique his interest in adapting Greenwald\u2019s book, but Clooney passed. \u201cStone will do a hatchet job on the movie, but it will still be the film of Snowden,\u201d he replied.For Stone, the impending Sony project was a call to arms. Fitzgerald cranked out a first draft of the script, and that fall Stone went out to studios with a budget of $50 million and a release date in December 2015. Each one turned it down, and Stone became convinced that the studios wanted to quash the project because of its controversial subject matter. \u201cThis is why corporations owning movie studios is not a good idea,\u201d he said.While Borman hustled to find independent financing, Stone dove into casting. For the lead, he chose Joseph Gordon-\u00adLevitt, the son of liberals from Sherman Oaks, Calif., and a former child actor who has retained a pleasingly boyish look. \u201cThere\u2019s an interesting blandness to him in the same way that Jimmy Stewart might\u2019ve been considered bland,\u201d Stone said. \u201cThere\u2019s a neutrality there, which allows him to grow on you.\u201d Shailene Woodley was cast to play Lindsay Mills, Zachary Quinto as Greenwald and Melissa Leo as Poitras.By early 2015, Borman and Stone had racked up several hundred thousand dollars in debt, but the money was still short. The shoot was ultimately delayed three weeks as the producer cobbled together European partners. In the United States, \u201cSnowden\u201d was picked up by Open Road Films, a small production company that had just put out \u201cJobs\u201d \u2014 the Kutcher version.\u201cIt was painful that we ended up with this independent distributor,\u201d Stone said.Borman offered that Open Road was not so independent anymore.\u201cI\u2019d never heard of it,\u201d Stone said, adding: \u201cI\u2019ve been there before, but not on this level and not at this age. So for me, it was very difficult personally.\u201dI had gotten my copy from Stone, who handed it to me with a disclaimer. \u201cNow, it\u2019s easy to take a shot at this,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, it wasn\u2019t the basis of the movie. But it\u2019s fun. I enjoyed reading it.\u201d\u201cTime of the Octopus\u201d takes place in a single night. The protagonist, Joshua Cold, is sequestered in a bunker at Sheremetyevo Airport, where his Russian lawyer keeps him company. The chapters alternate between their time-\u00adstamped conversations and those labeled as digital files (\u201cFile 004.wav\u201d), suggesting that they are the lawyer\u2019s transcribed recordings. The basic facts of Cold\u2019s case sound familiar, as do the character names: There are journalists named Boitras and Greywold and an organization called Mikileaks run by an Augusto Cassangie. For the most part, Cold and the lawyer sit and talk about life, quoting Laozi to each other. But there is also a distinctly post-\u00adSoviet tone to the novel, which reads both like a love letter to American culture \u2014 Steven Spielberg, B.B. King, \u201cThe Terminator,\u201d Penthouse magazine, Popeye, \u201cThe \u00adX-Files,\u201d Paul Newman, Bon Jovi, \u201cSpider-\u00adMan,\u201d \u201cBraveheart,\u201d Quentin Tarantino and Tupac Shakur are all mentioned \u2014 and a gleeful taunt to its government. \u201cNot only did [Cold] snap the beak of the American eagle,\u201d Kucherena writes, \u201cbut he also gave him a good kick and a very humiliating one, as if it was not a menacing predator but a rural hen.\u201dIn the bunker, Cold enjoys pizza and whiskey, but he is worried about American agents coming to retrieve him. \u201cBelieve me, Russia is not the worst option for you,\u201d the lawyer tells Cold. \u201cAnd you needn\u2019t regard us with such mistrust.\u201dOnce Cold is granted asylum, the propaganda is dialed up. \u201cI shall work in Russia and get an apartment!\u201d Cold announces. \u201cI thought I would spend the rest of my life in this underground prison.\u201d\u201cAs far as I know Mr. Putin, he is not one to change his mind easily,\u201d the lawyer assures him. \u201cAll will be O.K.\u201d The novel concludes with Cold vowing to learn to drink like the Russians, but the lawyer suggests he try Kvass instead, a fermented beverage made from rye bread. (\u201cIt is the Russian Coca-\u00adCola,\u201d the lawyer says.) Then they leave the bunker.\u201cWeird, huh?\u201d Fitzgerald said when I asked about the novel. In fact, few people associated with either Snowden or \u201cSnowden\u201d wanted to discuss it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say anything on the record about that book,\u201d Gordon-\u00adLevitt told me.According to WikiLeaks, Stone paid a million dollars for \u201cTime of the Octopus,\u201d which seemed like a hefty amount to pay for material that Stone admitted he had no plans of using. (That\u2019s the same figure Sony reportedly paid for the rights to \u201cEat, Pray, Love.\u201d) \u201cWe bought it because we did get good access to Ed,\u201d Stone explained. \u201cHe had to be brought along.\u201dDuring Stone\u2019s visits, Kucherena hosted the director at his favorite restaurants and at his dacha outside Moscow. \u201cThey had a kind of bromance,\u201d Fitzgerald told me. Photos from the trips look like vacation postcards, with Stone and Fitzgerald grinning in Red Army caps (a gift from Kucherena) and Fitzgerald and Gordon-\u00adLevitt posing for a selfie in front of St. Basil\u2019s Cathedral. While out in public, the group referred to Snowden as \u201cSasha,\u201d a nickname Kucherena had given him.Kucherena and I would eventually speak by phone. He said he wrote the novel because he had received calls from many \u201crepresentatives of Hollywood,\u201d writers and filmmakers. \u201cAt some point, I just thought to myself, Why don\u2019t I try to write the book?\u201d he said. I asked which writers and directors had called him. \u201cVery many people called me,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut I honestly don\u2019t remember their names now.\u201dThe lawyer was deeply troubled by the news media\u2019s insinuations that he is connected to the Kremlin. He pointed to several clients he has defended against the F.S.B., including Platon Obukhov, a writer accused of spying for Britain. \u201cI never had any kind of agreement with the Kremlin,\u201d he said. \u201cThey tried to say I\u2019m tied to the F.S.B., but that\u2019s complete nonsense, excuse me.\u201dKucherena said he was inspired by his favorite authors, who include Tom Clancy, Aldous Huxley and George Orwell. \u201cThe Octopus in my novel is, you can say, a direct offspring of Big Brother,\u201d he said. Like most writers of fiction, he was reluctant to discuss which parts of his book were based in reality. \u201cA person can only be open with someone he trusts,\u201d Kucherena said. \u201cAnd here, because he had no one else, it turned out that I took on the role of mother and father. Accordingly, we had confidential conversations of various sorts.\u201dHe did not see a conflict of interest in his writing the novel. \u201cI wrote an artistic book,\u201d Kucherena said. Because he represents Snowden pro bono, he never expected to capitalize on the relationship. \u201cI don\u2019t take any money from him,\u201d Kucherena said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any. So I wrote a book, yes, fine. So I got a little, as we say in Russian.\u201dDespite being the one to put the \u201cSnowden\u201d project into motion, Kucherena shied away from assuming any credit. \u201cI\u2019m very far from all that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just an advocate. Look at where I am and where Hollywood is!\u201dWizner, who is 45, has been at the A.C.L.U. since 2001. Before Snowden, he tried to bring several suits to increase oversight over the intelligence community. Wizner likes to say that he spent a decade banging his head against a wall, and then Snowden came along and brought that wall down. Snowden had not only revealed the scope of the surveillance apparatus, but also that top government officials routinely misled the public about it. Since becoming Snowden\u2019s advocate, Wizner has become a figure of not insignificant geopolitical importance. Those revelations have since formed a critical backdrop for legislative reforms, and there are few things that irritate Wizner more than claims that threaten to tarnish Snowden\u2019s character and their common cause.It would not be a stretch to say that for Wizner, Kucherena has become a bit of a liability. Since 2013, the Russian lawyer has announced that Snowden landed a job at a major Russian website \u2014 news that turned out to not be true \u2014 and has supplied the news media with photos of his client enjoying his new life in Russia, attending an opera at the Bolshoi Theater and cheerfully hugging a dog named Rick. (Rick later turned out to be the dog of one of Kucherena\u2019s friends.) Now Kucherena had sold a novel to Stone, making it seem as if the director had to pay a Russian fixer to have access to Snowden \u2014 or worse, that Snowden was somehow under the lock and key of the Russian authorities, lent to Stone for a Hollywood movie.Wizner\u2019s counterefforts in the United States have been successful. Former Attorney General Eric Holder, once a fierce critic, has acknowledged that Snowden performed \u201ca public service.\u201d President Obama has called for the reform of phone metadata collection, and last June, Congress passed the U.S.A. Freedom Act, a law that directly resulted from Snowden\u2019s leaks. Snowden has come to be seen as a levelheaded activist. According to Wizner, he leads a free existence in Russia, making appearances via live video and publishing op-eds against Russia\u2019s human rights violations. \u201cI think people are inclined to believe that Russia would never let him stay there unless he was paying for it in some way,\u201d Wizner said. \u201cBut it\u2019s just not true. Not only is he not cooperating, but he\u2019s actually being critical.\u201dWhen I asked Wizner about Kucherena\u2019s book, we were meeting at a cafe near his office in Lower Manhattan. \u201cMaybe you should just characterize my facial expression \u2014 \u2018He smirked,\u2019\u2009\u201d Wizner said. (Except that his smirk was mixed with a frown.)According to him, Snowden has not read Kucherena\u2019s book. \u201cThe thing is, Ed has much bigger fish to fry,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you had people calling for your assassination, you\u2019d be annoyed. If you were facing life in solitary confinement, you\u2019d be concerned. If someone wrote some book in Russia that no one is going to read, it doesn\u2019t register.\u201dWizner was reluctant to discuss Kucherena\u2019s role in Snowden\u2019s life, but he conceded that it was somewhat unorthodox. \u201cIt seems like the ethical rules governing the attorney-\u00adclient relationship may be somewhat different in Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be very unusual for a lawyer in a high-\u00adprofile case to provide exclusive photos of his client to newspapers or write an unauthorized book and sell it to Hollywood.\u201dKucherena and Wizner have never met. Whatever uneasiness there may be, Kucherena spoke warmly about his American counterpart. \u201cWe are on the same team!\u201d he told me. \u201cBen works in America, I work in Russia. If he wanted to write a book, I would have no problem.\u201d Wizner told me he has no plans to write a book about Snowden, fictional or otherwise.We had met in the lobby bar again, the day after he filmed Snowden, and the director was in better spirits. The shoot took place at Kucherena\u2019s dacha. The day went long. Stone\u2019s idea was to interview Snowden and capture an affecting moment that would give the film its dramatic ending. But the first takes were stiff. \u201cEd is used to answering questions on a level of intelligence,\u201d Stone said. \u201cBut I was interested in the emotional, which is difficult for him.\u201d Stone ended up doing nine takes. At one point, they took a break and went for a walk around Kucherena\u2019s property. By the end of the day, Stone decided that he had gotten Snowden to go as far as he was going to. \u201cHe was cooperative,\u201d Stone said. \u201cHe wanted to make it work. But as an actor \u2014 he\u2019s not used to that. I mean, he\u2019s not an actor. And I don\u2019t think he became one that day.\u201dTo make Snowden more comfortable, Stone worked with a minimal crew. Some were meeting the whistle-\u00adblower for the first time and still seemed a bit star-struck. \u201cSuddenly this little creature comes teetering in \u2014 so fragile, so lovely, such a charming, well-\u00adbehaved, beautiful little man,\u201d the cinematographer, Anthony Dod Mantle, told me. \u201cHe\u2019s like an old soul in a very young body. He\u2019s got fingers like violins.\u201d Filming Snowden reminded Mantle of shooting other men with outsize reputations and slight builds. \u201cIt\u2019s like Bono or Al Pacino,\u201d he added. \u201cThose guys are teeny-\u00adweenies. But if you isolate him into a frame, he can be as big as anybody else.\u201dMantle shot Danny Boyle\u2019s \u201cSlumdog Millionaire\u201d and \u201c127 Hours,\u201d but \u201cSnowden\u201d proved to be a special challenge. Convinced that making the film on American soil would be too risky, Stone decided to film in Germany, where Borman was able to score some tax subsidies. With roughly 140 script pages to shoot in 54 days, the crew sprinted from Munich to Washington, to Hawaii, to Hong Kong, and then back to Munich. Often, Mantle wouldn\u2019t get to see locations before he had to film in them. To cut costs, the suburbs of Munich had to stand in for rural Maryland and Virginia, with German extras cast as Americans. \u201cThank God the Germans act like Americans,\u201d Stone said.The production itself resembled a covert operation, with a code name (\u201cSasha\u201d had stuck) and elaborate security protocols. Worried that \u201cSasha\u201d would be of interest to the N.S.A., Borman and Stone avoided discussing production details by phone or email \u2014 \u201cIt was all handwritten notes and long walks in the park,\u201d Borman said \u2014 and kept the script on air-\u00adgapped computers, ones that have never been connected to the internet. If it had to be mailed, Borman would mix up the pages into four packages, which he would send with four different couriers to four different addresses. \u201cMaybe nobody gave a [expletive],\u201d Borman told me. \u201cOr maybe the N.S.A. is laughing at us like, \u2018Look at those idiots \u2014 of course we copied everything that came through DHL and FedEx!\u201dFor the actors, the frenetic schedule and paranoia on set added to the mood of the production. \u201cSnowden himself was in the midst of a stressful situation, so the fact that our shoot was a little bit that way, I think, helped,\u201d Gordon-\u00adLevitt said, before catching himself. \u201cMaking the movie was obviously a walk in the park compared to what he did. But just to have those little emotional touch points can help when you\u2019re acting.\u201dCommitted to inhabiting Snowden\u2019s robotic speech pattern, Gordon-\u00adLevitt lifted the audio from \u201cCitizenfour\u201d and played it on repeat while he slept. He also worried that some of the dialogue felt heavy-\u00adhanded. \u201cOliver is very into making his point,\u201d the actor said, \u201cas he should be. I really admire him for that. But I felt like it was my job to be like, \u2018O.K., I want to make the point, too, but this is a human being and not just a mouthpiece.\u201d Stone found Gordon-\u00adLevitt\u2019s approach too \u201cdocumentary-\u00adish\u201d at times. \u201cI was trying for the dramatic side as much as possible,\u201d Stone said. Fitzgerald was ultimately flown in to the set to execute last-\u00adminute rewrites.By late spring of 2015, Stone was close to wrapping when his mother, Jacqueline Goddet Stone, died at 93. She had called him in Munich, but Stone felt he couldn\u2019t risk leaving. \u201cTo go to L.A. would have cost us three down days,\u201d Stone told me. \u201cI knew she was going to pass, but I thought I could make it.\u201d Stone remained on set during the funeral and kept shooting.Stone\u2019s trip to Moscow to film the real Snowden was the last bit he needed to complete the film. But he was still worried \u2014 that the footage would be leaked, that critics would eviscerate it, that Snowden wouldn\u2019t like it. \u201cI want him to vet it,\u201d he said. He was heading to New York to begin editing and planned to return to Moscow at the end of the summer to show Snowden a rough cut. \u201cO.K., my dear,\u201d Stone said, getting up to leave. \u201cSee you in New York.\u201dThen he disappeared for six months.At the time, Stone wasn\u2019t interested, and Greenwald negotiated the deal with Sony. Stone later came back and offered to match Sony\u2019s bid, but Greenwald declined. \u201cI think he was a little perturbed,\u201d Greenwald said. Of the principal cast, Zachary Quinto, who plays Greenwald in Stone\u2019s movie, was the only actor who didn\u2019t meet his real-life counterpart as research. \u201cI always thought that was a little weird,\u201d Greenwald said. \u201cI think Oliver thought I had some competitive hostility toward his project, or he had some hostility \u2014 I\u2019m not really sure.\u201d (According to Stone, Quinto didn\u2019t need to meet Greenwald because there were so many videos of the journalist online.)In the spring of 2014, Stone flew to Berlin and met with Poitras. The meeting did not go well. According to Poitras, Stone proposed that she delay the release of \u201cCitizenfour,\u201d which she was then in the middle of editing, to time up with his film. \u201cBecause his film would be the real movie \u2014 because it\u2019s a Hollywood movie,\u201d Poitras told me. \u201cObviously I wasn\u2019t interested in doing that. To have another filmmaker ask me to delay the release of my film was \u2014 well, it was somewhat insulting.\u201dStone was annoyed, but he stuck around for a few drinks. They discussed new movies, including \u201c12 Years a Slave.\u201d As Poitras recalls, Stone found the film too violent, while Poitras thought the brutality was appropriate given the subject matter. Stone was growing increasingly frustrated. \u201cAt some point, he reached over and had his hands around my neck,\u201d Poitras said. \u201cIt was sort of in a joking way. I think he was a little bit drunk. But it was not a particularly pleasant evening.\u201dAccording to Stone, he only offered to help Poitras get distribution. \u201cWe thought we\u2019d help her either bring out her film with our film, or in the wake of it or before it, if we could,\u201d Stone said. He didn\u2019t recall pretending to strangle Poitras. \u201cI think from talking to her, you sense she\u2019s superparanoid,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I liked her,\u201d he continued. \u201cI admired her. I saw her films. I was trying to help her. If Laura is accusing me of trying to aggress her or kill her, she\u2019s crazy.\u201dStone\u2019s torment is at least in part self-\u00adinflicted. Biopics can be a nasty business, and Stone routinely throws himself into historical narratives and the messy negotiation between fact and fiction. The haggling with historians and family estates is the reason Stone was never able to make films about Martin Luther King Jr. and Hank Williams, and it was why he had to wait for Richard M. Nixon to die to make \u201cNixon.\u201d For Stone, the real-life characters of the stories he is after have become both the obstacles and the necessary arbiters of his work. It\u2019s why he refused to make \u201cSnowden\u201d without Snowden, and why his appeals to Greenwald and Poitras were his way of getting them on board.If Poitras had a strong reaction to Stone\u2019s proposal, it was because she had already been hounded by Sony. After the studio optioned Greenwald\u2019s book, Poitras says Sony asked to buy her life rights \u2014 an offer she declined. Sony suggested that she come on as a consultant, but when the contract arrived, it stipulated that the studio would have access to Poitras\u2019s tapes and notebooks. \u201cSo I\u2019d already gone through that when Oliver came in trying to position himself,\u201d she said.Poitras is a soft-\u00adspoken, cautious woman who has spent much of the past decade on government watch lists. Her resistance to participating in various Snowden projects has less to do with her feeling territorial than with her trying to maintain some control as she has become a character in a story that is no longer hers. Poitras\u2019s radical position is that the \u201cSnowden story\u201d can really belong only to Snowden. \u201cI could have asked him for a life-rights contract in Hong Kong, but I don\u2019t believe in that as a concept,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s his story, and I hope he tells it when he\u2019s ready.\u201dNeither Greenwald nor Poitras ultimately object to Stone making his film. While his own movie still lingered in development, Greenwald thought Snowden\u2019s story might in fact be safer in Stone\u2019s hands than it would be elsewhere. The Sony leaks would eventually reveal that Stone\u2019s paranoia may have been justified: In emails about the purchase of Greenwald\u2019s book, an executive in Sony\u2019s government-\u00adaffairs office suggests toning down the news release, changing \u201cillegal spying\u201d to \u201cintelligence gathering\u201d and \u201cmisuse of power\u201d to \u201cactions.\u201d\u201cMy big worry with Hollywood and the Snowden story is that they\u2019re either going to be cowards and completely drain it of its political vitality,\u201d Greenwald told me, \u201cor that they\u2019re going to do a superbiased smear job. For all the talk about how liberal Hollywood is, the reality is that they\u2019re really close to the government. And whatever other things you might say about Oliver, I was actually relieved that someone was going to do this film where there was no danger of those things happening.\u201dLike \u201cCitizenfour,\u201d \u201cSnowden\u201d takes place in Hong Kong, but this time the story has the eerie feeling of a familiar scene re-\u00adenacted by skilled Hollywood actors. Stone was right about Gordon-\u00adLevitt. His performance is not an interpretation so much as a direct replica of the whistle-\u00adblower\u2019s even demeanor and intonation. Quinto plays Greenwald with such intensity that he appears perpetually enraged. Melissa Leo\u2019s Poitras is in turn warm and protective, almost maternal.Stone came in just as the credits rolled. He was nursing a cold but was back on caffeine and asked his assistant for Bulletproof, the trendy coffee brand made with \u201cgrass-fed butter.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be nutritional,\u201d Stone said. \u201cNo radicals.\u201dSince I last saw him, the film\u2019s release had been pushed from December 2015 to May 2016 as Stone rushed to complete it, and then once more to September 2016. The biggest challenge was pacing. Stone likes to structure his movies around a series of plot-\u00adpivoting, battlelike scenes \u2014 the concerts in \u201cThe Doors,\u201d the football games in \u201cAny Given Sunday\u201d or actual warfare in \u201cAlexander.\u201d A story in which the drama hinges on a tech specialist downloading classified documents was more subdued than he was accustomed to. \u201cCoding is not exciting,\u201d Stone said. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s a nerdlike behavior \u2014 it\u2019s dull on a screen.\u201dStone got around the tedium of reality by turning his film into a cross between a cyberthriller and a love story, using Snowden\u2019s relationship with Mills to inject emotional stakes. Cutting between Snowden in Hong Kong and flashbacks to his past, the film speeds through Snowden\u2019s biography with the help of techno music, snappy explanations of N.S.A. programs and tricky camerawork to build in the tension of surveillance. (There are scenes filmed from the perspective of tiny phone cameras \u2014 the modern peephole \u2014 and suggestive zoom-ins on eye pupils.)But there are also unmistakable Stone-isms. \u201cI just don\u2019t really like bashing my country,\u201d Gordon-\u00adLevitt says to Woodley as they stroll past a Bush-\u00adera antiwar protest in front of the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s my country, too,\u201d Woodley says. \u201cAnd right now, it\u2019s got blood on its hands.\u201dSnowden\u2019s N.S.A. boss is unsubtly named Corbin O\u2019Brian, after the antagonist in Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984.\u201d \u201cMost Americans don\u2019t want freedom,\u201d O\u2019Brian tells Snowden. \u201cThey want security.\u201dSnowden\u2019s many storytellers all tell a similar hero narrative. But if Greenwald\u2019s account is about journalism, Poitras\u2019s is a subtle and artful character study and Kucherena\u2019s is an attempt at the Russian novel \u2014 a man alone in a room, wrestling with his conscience \u2014 Stone\u2019s is the explicit blockbuster version, told in high gloss with big, emotional music and digestible plot points that will appeal to mass audiences. As Wizner wisely anticipated, it is the narrative most likely to cement Snowden\u2019s story in Americans\u2019 minds.Snowden declined to comment for this article, but Stone told me he had seen the film and liked it. At a screening at Comic-\u00adCon a few months later, Snowden would beam in via satellite to give his somewhat wary approval. \u201cIt was something that made me really nervous,\u201d he said of Stone\u2019s film. \u201cBut I think he made it work.\u201dAs Stone intended, Snowden shows up at the end of the film. He appears in a wood-\u00adpaneled room in Kucherena\u2019s dacha, a modest, foreign-\u00adlooking space, with little to see except a vase of flowers and some curtains in the background. The Snowden who speaks is not the stoic version, but one who manages to deliver a Stone-\u00adcaliber movie line. \u201cI no longer have to worry about what happens tomorrow,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause I\u2019m happy with what I\u2019ve done today.\u201d Just before the screen fades to black, Snowden is shown gazing toward a window, a faint, inscrutable smile on his face.Gordon-\u00adLevitt was so moved by Snowden\u2019s story that he donated most of his salary from the film to the A.C.L.U. and used the rest to collaborate with Wizner on a series of videos about democracy. Wizner was preparing to petition Obama to grant Snowden a presidential pardon in the fall, and he hoped Stone\u2019s film would help transform the public\u2019s perception of his client. Kucherena, meanwhile, had turned \u201cTime of the Octopus\u201d into a trilogy \u2014 in the sequel, the N.S.A. sends an assassin to Russia to \u201celiminate\u201d Joshua Cold. He hoped to come to the United States for the premiere of the film, in which he has a cameo as a Russian banker who encounters Snowden at a party. \u201cIf I can get a visa, why not?\u201d he said.In July, Stone and Wizner joined forces for an A.C.L.U. event. The evening was billed as a conversation with Wizner about surveillance and Edward Snowden, with Stone hosting at his Tudor-\u00adstyle home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles.As several dozen West Coast supporters of the A.C.L.U. filtered into Stone\u2019s backyard, the director sat camped out on a bench by the pool, taking the party in from a distance. He boasted that he had recently cut four more minutes from the film, bringing the run time to a lean 134 minutes. I asked if he would keep finessing until the end. \u201cNo, it\u2019s over,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is it. Now I die.\u201dWizner roamed around, inspecting a meditation gazebo outfitted with a large gold Buddha. After several people inquired who was playing him in the movie, the lawyer came up with a pithy reply. \u201cKevin Spacey, reprising his role as Keyser Soze,\u201d he joked. \u201cThe guy behind the guy behind the guy \u2014 hiding in plain sight.\u201d (Wizner is not a character in Stone\u2019s film.)That week, NPR ran an interview with a Russian security official who posited that Snowden is maybe, probably, most definitely cooperating with Russian intelligence. This inevitably set Wizner off. \u201cOf course, this is the same week that Snowden is blasting Putin on Twitter every day,\u201d Wizner said to Borman, who nodded along. The producer suggested that Snowden\u2019s critics would claim it\u2019s a cover. \u201cThat\u2019s what they say!\u201d Wizner said. \u201cThis is preapproved criticism so that it\u2019ll seem like he\u2019s free, but actually Putin is the master pulling the strings.\u201dEventually, everyone moved to the den, a spacious, brightly lit room filled with family photos. Matthew Weiner, the \u201cMad Men\u201d creator, took a seat by a stack of DVDs, which included multiple seasons of his own hit TV show. Others arranged themselves along wicker chairs that lined the room\u2019s perimeter. The whole thing had the feeling of a P.T.A. meeting, but without the stale cookies.Wizner got up and spoke for some time about his efforts as Snowden\u2019s lawyer. As he opened the room to questions, someone asked how long Russia could be relied on to keep Snowden safe. Wizner turned the question over to Stone. \u201cOliver is the Russia expert,\u201d he said with a hint of passive-\u00adaggression. Since completing \u201cSnowden,\u201d Stone had become absorbed in his newfound interest in Russia and announced that he was making a documentary about Putin. In recent months, he had accompanied the Russian president to a theater performance and a World War II Victory Day parade in Moscow. \u201cHe represents a different point of view that Americans don\u2019t want to hear,\u201d Stone had told RIA Novosti, a Russian news service.When someone else asked about Stone\u2019s experience of making \u201cSnowden,\u201d his answer was despondent. \u201cIt was really a horrible experience in every way,\u201d he said. Everyone laughed except for Stone.As the guests dispersed, Wizner lingered in the foyer, admiring Stone\u2019s art collection depicting important and mostly dead men. He thought that a print of Jean-Paul Sartre looked like Steve Buscemi and that a pained-\u00adlooking Beethoven was actually Stone. On the opposite wall was a sketch of Genghis Khan, the feared Mongolian emperor. Stone called him a liberal.\u201cYes, Genghis Khan \u2014 misunderstood,\u201d Wizner teased.Stone smiled and cocked his head. \u201cListen, the A.C.L.U. should defend him!\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In the Brazilian Rain Forest, \u2018a White Elephant, a Big One\u2019", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySports of The TimesMANAUS, Brazil \u2014 Our tale takes metaphorical root in the early 1880s and the fevered imaginings of rubber barons. Sitting by the vast Amazon River, bewitched by pink river dolphins and torrential downpours, surrounded by rain forest, these men hungered for a legacy worthy of kings.So they imported an Italian architect, the mellifluously named Celestial Sacardim, to build an opera house. He conceived a heaven: columns of Carrara marble; chandeliers of Murano glass; 36,000 hand-painted roof tiles from Alsace; parquet floors of walnut, oak and Norwegian maple; tapestries from the looms of Flanders. Liverpool foundries provided the steel.The Teatro Amazonas was beautiful and insanely expensive and as ephemeral as everything else in this sweltering land. The rubber barons, legend has it, persuaded Enrico Caruso to journey here and sing Verdi. Then the rubber economy collapsed, and the opera house, which still stands in the colonial quarter, fell into decade upon decade of damp disuse.All of which brings us to a new hallucination: the Arena da Amaz\u00f4nia in Manaus, a city whose name comes from a local tribe and means Mother of the Gods. When Brazil embarked on an orgy of arena construction for the World Cup in 2014, Manaus city leaders decided to build the grandest arena of all. Years in the making, at a cost of $220 million, it was crafted to resemble a giant white basket of a type common in the region, atop a four-story concrete plaza. The arena seats 44,351 people.Save for the rarest of occasions, such as when Olympic women\u2019s soccer teams played here recently, this arena sits empty. Manaus is surrounded by a rain forest the size of France, Spain, Sweden, Greece and Italy combined, and it is reachable only by airplane or boat. Most in this hard-working city of two million have more on their mind than sports. The debt for this ziggurat has piled high and requires siphoning off of money intended for schools and hospitals. One-quarter of Manauarans are extremely poor; many lack running water.I wandered into the high-ceiling marble cafe of that opera house, which has been reincarnated as a tourist attraction and for music and dance events. Erica Damasceno, 20, sipped coffee as I asked about the stadium.She wagged her hand. \u201cI never go there,\u201d she said.Never? She shook her head. \u201cNever. So much money was put into it, and we have such great needs: schools, hospitals. Every big public project is an excuse to steal money.\u201dI stepped outside into an equatorial sun that felt like a fat hand pressed down on my skull. I found Maciel De Souza sitting in the shade of a tree with his co-worker Natalia Vilacio, tourist guides without tourists. Do you go to the stadium?\u201cYes,\u201d De Souza replied. How often? \u201cOnce.\u201dHe shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s a white elephant, a big one,\u201d he said in Portuguese through an interpreter. \u201cSometimes tourists like to see it. No one is ever inside.\u201dArena dreams tend toward the ridiculous, from Milwaukee to Minneapolis to Manaus. Promises of economic benefits are as illusory as lost civilizations. FIFA, the world soccer federation, required that World Cup host nations build at least eight stadiums. Brazil, in a fit of prideful excess, insisted on building 10, at a cost of nearly $2 billion.Those stadiums have become aspiring archaeological digs. Bras\u00edlia spent $550 million to build its stadium; it doubles as a municipal bus depot. The stadium in Cuiab\u00e1 cost $230 million, and homeless men sleep in the locker rooms. Managers at Recife\u2019s grand Arena Pernambuco are at such wits\u2019 end that they rented it out for a 15-year-old boy\u2019s birthday.The magazine Americas Quarterly found that Brazil\u2019s expenses for the World Cup greatly outran its revenue. Brazil repeated its wasteful act for the Olympics. There are corruption inquiries in a half-dozen states, with construction companies and hapless officials under the magnifying glass.That brings us back to Manaus and its Fitzcarraldo-esque excess. (Fitzcarraldo was the dreamer in a Werner Herzog movie who had the unhinged ambition to haul a steamship over a mountain in the Peruvian Amazon.)As was true for the opera house, no expense was spared in the construction of the Arena da Amaz\u00f4nia. Steel was poured in Europe and loaded at the port of Aveiro in Portugal. Workers filled three giant freighters to the gills with steel, and a fourth ferried the membrane that serves as the roof. It took this fleet 20 days to trundle across the Atlantic and many more to edge up the Amazon.Construction was a dank nightmare. Three workers died. Foundations were poured, and repoured. Steel joints buckled in the humidity. Project managers discovered that \u201can unwelcome tributary of the French River\u201d ran under the site. From December to March, Manaus receives about 45 inches of rain, so there was the Noah problem, too.No roads run to Manaus other than dangerous dirt tracks impassable in wet weather. As the project manager said at the time, \u201cThis was a huge, huge, huge challenge.\u201dThose challenges later turned to red ink. The local soccer teams here are the equivalent of the Rookie League Kingsport Mets and draw 1,000 fans on the best nights. They could not afford the rent. A few big league teams, those from S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, sometimes played here, but only if the state containing Manaus provided a subsidy of one sort or another. It is a four-hour flight from Rio to this capital of the Amazon.I imagine that Bono and Beyonc\u00e9 and Kendrick Lamar might dream of singing beneath a canopy of giant kapok trees. So far, none have journeyed here to do so.Fabricio Lima, Manaus\u2019s secretary of state for youth, sports and leisure, sat for an interview last week with my colleague Tania Franco. He faces daunting numbers. From January to April, the Arena da Amaz\u00f4nia generated $180,000 in revenue. Its expenses in that period totaled $560,000.That was its least-terrible performance in a while. So far, Lima\u2019s best customers are the Amazon\u2019s many evangelical ministers.Each night he dreams grandly; each morning he acts modestly. What is his latest idea for the arena? He smiled and replied, \u201cWeddings and birthday parties.\u201dLater that day, I walked through the old wrought-iron market down by the banks of the Amazon. A hot wind eddied and swirled, and I listened as Marcio Morais, an herb merchant, explained how his grandfather, who was raised in the jungle, taught him to harvest herbs. Liver inflammation, kidney problems, asthma, erectile dysfunction: He has an herb for nearly every ailment. Our talk turned to the arena.He frowned. \u201cOlympic Games are nice, but why are we spending money on this?\u201d he said. \u201cIt could have been a university. It could have been a school. Do you know we have an opera house? Such big dreams.\u201dI allowed that I knew of those dreams. \u201cSometimes you have to wake up,\u201d he replied.With that, we shook hands, and I stepped out into the dream-inducing heat.Email: powellm@nytimes.comslide showAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Aging Boy Band Calls It Quits, but Japan Can\u2019t Let Go", "Date": "2016-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 For nearly three decades, millions of Japanese have clamored for their every album, lined up with breathless anticipation for their concerts and gathered on Monday nights for their hit television show.Now, the nation is awash with anguish over word that SMAP \u2014 Japan\u2019s longest-running boy band, if it can still be called that with its youngest member pushing 40 \u2014 is splitting up.The news has dominated newspaper headlines and television talk shows since the band\u2019s announcement this month. Even the mayor of Tokyo and two members of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s cabinet have weighed in. One said he was worried about the effect on the Japanese economy, the world\u2019s third-largest.To understand the bedlam unfolding here, think of the Beatles\u2019 breaking up, the airing of the final episode of \u201cSeinfeld\u201d and the \u201cconscious uncoupling\u201d of Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin all rolled into one \u2014 the end of an era on the Japanese cultural landscape.SMAP\u2019s most famous saccharine single, \u201cThe Only Flower in the World,\u201d is regularly taught in Japan\u2019s schools. But SMAP is not just a wildly popular band whose albums have sold more than 35 million copies, making it one of the most successful musical acts in Japanese history.The group, whose members started out as teenagers performing on skateboards and now range in age from 39 to 44, managed to both broaden its audience beyond adolescent girls and hold on to them over the years. Many of their most ardent fans are women who grew up with them.Much of the drama and commentary surrounding SMAP\u2019s breakup has been tied to suspicions among fans and industry analysts of skulduggery by the talent agency that manages the group, Johnny & Associates, which has dominated the Japanese boy-band scene for nearly four decades.That business model, pioneered in Asia to dizzying success by Mr. Kitagawa with SMAP and other groups, has since been replicated by talent agencies in China and South Korea, many of which have been accused of signing children to \u201cslave contracts\u201d that require them to surrender half or more of all profits for as long as a decade.According to Japanese news reports, SMAP decided to call it quits after four of its members tried to leave the Johnny agency, which is said to control their appearances on television and in movies, as well as merchandising rights to their images.In announcing the band\u2019s dissolution, the agency said it would continue to represent each of the group\u2019s members as solo acts. The agency said it had initially proposed a temporary break but that \u201csome members\u201d wanted a permanent split.SMAP seemed on the verge of disbanding in January as rumors swirled of infighting. But in a rare live appearance on their television show, the singers, wearing somber black suits, announced that they were staying together and apologized for having caused their fans distress.The public apology was viewed in nearly seven million households, and even the prime minister, Mr. Abe, was moved to comment, telling a parliamentary committee that \u201cthe group will remain intact in response to many fans\u2019 wishes, which is good.\u201dMr. Abe has yet to address the breakup.Each of the band\u2019s members has issued a written statement, but so far only two have spoken in public about the split, apologizing on their weekly radio shows for surprising fans with the announcement.Writing in Josei Seven, a weekly magazine, the cultural critic and columnist Akio Nakamori asked if the performers were being muzzled.Given SMAP\u2019s popularity in Asia, Japan\u2019s minister of economy, trade and industry, Hiroshige Seko, said he was concerned that the breakup might undermine the country\u2019s \u201cCool Japan\u201d campaign, aimed at exporting Japanese culture to foreign countries.But there are signs that SMAP is already being replaced by its successors.On a visit this week to a store run by Johnny & Associates in the Harajuku neighborhood of Tokyo, I watched fans buy professional photo cards of their favorite singers, but there were no SMAP cards on sale. And when I checked out an official fan club in the Shibuya district, also operated by the agency, I saw videos only of other Japanese boy bands playing on a screen.A wall was covered with current promotional posters for multiple boy bands. There was just one for SMAP, from 2012.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misidentified the sports equipment that members of SMAP performed on as teenagers. They used skateboards, not roller skates. The same error appeared in a picture caption.Hisako Ueno contributed reporting. Becky Zhuang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wisdom, Courage and the Economy", "Date": "2016-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhich brings me to my main subject: Mrs. Clinton\u2019s economic vision, which she summarized last week. It\u2019s very much a center-left vision: incremental but fairly large increases in high-income tax rates, further tightening of financial regulation, further strengthening of the social safety net.So here\u2019s my question: Is the modesty of the Clinton economic agenda too much of a good thing? Should accelerating U.S. economic growth be a bigger priority?After all, what do we actually know how to do when it comes to economic policy? We do, in fact, know how to provide essential health care to everyone; most advanced countries do it. We know how to provide basic security in retirement. We know quite a lot about how to raise the incomes of low-paid workers.I\u2019d also argue that we know how to fight financial crises and recessions, although political gridlock and deficit obsession has gotten in the way of using that knowledge.On the other hand, what do we know about accelerating long-run growth? According to the budget office, potential growth was pretty stable from 1970 to 2000, with nothing either Ronald Reagan or Bill Clinton did making much obvious difference. The subsequent slide began under George W. Bush and continued under Mr. Obama. This history suggests no easy way to change the trend.Now, I\u2019m not saying that we shouldn\u2019t try. I\u2019d argue, in particular, for substantially more infrastructure spending than Mrs. Clinton is currently proposing, and more borrowing to pay for it. This might significantly boost growth. But it would be unwise to count on it.Meanwhile, I don\u2019t think enough people appreciate the courage involved in focusing on things we actually know how to do, as opposed to happy talk about wondrous growth.When conservatives promise fantastic growth if we give them another chance at Bushonomics, one main reason is that they don\u2019t want to admit how much they would have to cut popular programs to pay for their tax cuts. When centrists urge us to look away from questions of distribution and fairness and focus on growth instead, all too often they\u2019re basically running away from the real issues that divide us politically.So it\u2019s actually quite brave to say: \u201cHere are the things I want to do, and here is how I\u2019ll pay for them. Sorry, some of you will have to pay higher taxes.\u201d Wouldn\u2019t it be great if that kind of policy honesty became the norm?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Without Britain, European Leaders Chart a Rocky New Course", "Date": "2016-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo the summer weather did little to disguise the gloom that hung over a small summit meeting on Monday held by the leaders of the three nations off the coast of Naples, Italy, where they began charting a new course for the 27 countries that will be left in the bloc.The three leaders used the moment to present a united front, emphasizing that the benefits of the union far outweighed the challenges it faced and making clear that Europe would persevere, even after the British vote.\u201cWe respect the choice of British citizens, but we want to write a new page for the future,\u201d Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy said. The aftermath of the \u201cBrexit\u201d vote, as it is commonly known, called for \u201cstrong measures to boost growth and fight youth unemployment,\u201d he said, as well as for investments and structural reforms.The way forward, however, was far from clear. Though Mr. Renzi played the host, the role of guiding the bloc rests largely on the shoulders of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, the leader of Europe\u2019s strongest economy.Ms. Merkel, like Mr. Renzi and President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France, faces immediate challenges that make decisive action even more difficult than it has been for the last several years in the face of Europe\u2019s economic, migration and border crises.Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.On Monday, former President Nicolas Sarkozy formally announced that he would run to again be the standard-bearer for the center-right Republicans party, though when he left office four years ago, he too was deeply unpopular.Italy recorded zero growth in the second quarter this year. Mr. Renzi has staked his political future on a November referendum on constitutional changes. Defeat could mean early elections.Yet the three leaders themselves remain divided on critical issues, not least whether to allow flexibility on stiff budget requirements for the 19 eurozone countries that Ms. Merkel insists are necessary and that Mr. Renzi, especially, blames for stunting economic growth.Allowing some leeway might bolster Mr. Hollande and Mr. Renzi politically, but it would be further proof of the European Union\u2019s inability to stick to its own rules.Jan Techau, a German analyst who is the chairman of Carnegie Europe in Brussels, cast doubt on whether any progress could be made on the issue.\u201cHe wants a revised eurozone, moving away from austerity,\u201d Mr. Techau said, referring to Mr. Renzi. \u201cEveryone knows that the eurozone must be reformed. But the timing and direction are completely open, and completely disputed.\u201dMs. Merkel faces national elections in the fall of 2017, and it is unlikely that a euro overhaul will be achieved before then, Mr. Techau noted. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to get rushed into anything before elections next year.\u201dAs a leading German newspaper, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, put it, \u201cOver the next month, Europe will embark on a quest for meaning.\u201dBritain\u2019s financial and military connections to the rest of Europe.The talks on Monday are supposed to culminate in mid-September in a meeting of the 27 nations that will remain in the bloc. The three top leaders have promised new efforts on internal and external security; fresh stimulus for growth and jobs; and special programs for Europe\u2019s youth, who are bearing the brunt of unemployment almost everywhere but Germany.There is no clear indication of how or why these efforts would succeed where others have failed. Yet the pressure is immense; if Europe cannot rally to its many challenges, anti-European Union feelings could lead to even more referendums.The Netherlands, which already voted against a Europe-wide agreement on Ukraine in a referendum this summer, \u201care a very nervous European partner at the moment,\u201d Mr. Techau said.Other factors gnawing at Europe\u2019s fragile unity include the rerun presidential election scheduled for Oct. 2 in Austria, where a far-right politician could win in the first such triumph in Europe since 1945.Ms. Merkel will spend the rest of the week crisscrossing central and Eastern Europe and then hosting Western European conservative leaders at a castle outside Berlin to try to forge new unity. Mr. Hollande and Mr. Renzi are likely to reach out to politicians in Portugal, Spain and Greece to unite the Continent\u2019s southern flank.One important task is working out a mandate for Michel Barnier, a veteran politician from France, to negotiate with the British on behalf of the European Union.No one knows when negotiations on Britain\u2019s departure will begin. Prime Minister Theresa May has hinted that London might not activate the relevant clause \u2014 known as Article 50 \u2014 until late this year, or even early in 2017. The complex separation will then have to be negotiated within two years.In Ms. Merkel\u2019s view, that ball is very much in Britain\u2019s court. In contrast to the many meetings planned with European leaders this week, the only place she will run into a leading Briton is at a celebration in Germany\u2019s most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, where Britain will be represented by Prince William, who, like other members of the royal family, has no say in politics.\u201cWe are not conducting any prenegotiations with the British, Ms. Merkel\u2019s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said on Monday. \u201cIt is up to them to tell us\u201d when the clock starts ticking on Britain\u2019s membership, he said, which for now remains, \u201cwith all the advantages \u2014 and all the obligations.\u201dElisabetta Povoledo contributed reporting from Rome.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Protest Looks Like", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe StoneThis theory of the state underlies media and state reporting of political protest, in which violence is always invoked to disqualify the grievances of protesters. In the 1960s, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was able to to use media coverage of disproportionate violence against nonresisting demonstrators in Birmingham or Selma to convey his message as a form of martyrdom. He wrote: \u201cwe\u2019ll wear you down by our capacity to suffer\u2026we will so appeal to your heart and conscience that we will win you in the process.\u201dToday, if police dogs attack demonstrators, it is no longer national news. Ironically, the example of King himself, so often vilified as a traitor and a Communist in his lifetime, is used to berate today\u2019s protesters with the demand for nonviolence, meaning compliance with police instructions. King never intended nonviolence to mean compliance with the state. But when the term violence is used, it now signifies a moral and political failing by the \u201cpeople,\u201d those not authorized to use force. Whenever Palestinians protest against the occupation of their land, the response in some quarters is always to call it violent, no matter what has happened. So I find myself avoiding the term altogether in relation to protests.What activists then did in the U.S. was to create a performative form of protest that insisted we not look away but consider over and over again what had happened. \u201cHands Up, Don\u2019t Shoot\u201d calls our attention to the instant before the definitive violence, a moment where a reasonable person (to use legal phrasing) could and should have decided against shooting, for example, 12-year-old Tamir Rice. By performing this collectively, it also became a challenge to the police, saying in effect, \u201cyou don\u2019t dare to shoot, there are too many of us.\u201dThe mass \u201cdie-in,\u201d an action appropriated from earlier movements in which protesters mime death as a group, further emphasizes that all are potential targets. Performed death, a visual act, makes each person appear vulnerable, but simultaneously creates a sense of freedom as you rest your body with others in spaces where you never normally are at rest. Both these forms of protest create what I call a \u201cpersistent looking,\u201d a repeated return to the place of loss so that it is possible to move past the first shock of violence to an understanding of the systemic violence that brought it about.By comparison, the pictures of the body of Aylan Kurdi, the 3-year-old drowned Syrian toddler who washed up on a Turkish beach, broke through the shield that we all create in what the German philosopher Walter Benjamin called \u201cthe optical unconscious.\u201d An outpouring of grief in the West made it seem as if we were seeing refugees die for the first time, although such drownings have been common for decades. The picture of a Turkish policeman carrying his body resonated because of its association (whether conscious or not) with the Christian image known as the piet\u00e0, in which the Virgin Mary carries the body of the dead Christ. We looked at Aylan\u2019s body and realized that he had indeed died for our sins.A few months later, however, Britain voted to leave the European Union, largely because of intense resentment of all immigrants, including refugees. Here, then, is the dilemma. Certain images have the capacity to break through the defenses of our optical unconscious, but precisely because that unconscious is a way of dealing with the intense violence of modern life, it seals over quickly. When these moments occur, change results only if people organize around the general principle that such images convey.Black Lives Matter has done this. But in the case of Aylan Kurdi, while efforts were made for individual refugees, no general case for immigration and asylum was effectively promoted after his death. Still less did Western media outlets turn to the Kurdish community for understanding.Within these activist communities online, people often speak of being connected by love. This love is not romantic love between individuals but the collective bond that Dr. King called \u201cthe beloved community.\u201d For his colleague and friend Grace Lee Boggs, the result was what she called \u201cvisionary organizing.\u201d Such organizing thinks about how to make a life, not make a living. These exchanges are horizontal, requiring a good deal of time and energy to sustain. But they can make change.These are times for visionary organizing, not outraged reposting.There have been two notable responses to the breakdown of the space of appearance. Former protesters and the disillusioned have either set out to create a new politics of appearance or they have reacted by looking for groups to blame.From the Zapatistas to the global Occupy project and today\u2019s Nuit Debout movement in France, the politics of appearance is no longer about submitting a petition to power, but instead organizing so that people can appear to each other. That means suspending the regulation of the space of appearance by norms, above all the norms of racial hierarchy, and then refusing to move on out of that space. I believe that is why Black Lives Matter has acted to disrupt all the major presidential campaigns in 2016. It is seeking to form a new manner of being \u201cpolitical,\u201d a new way to see and be seen in the world.But the other possibility, the blaming of other groups, is a reaction to a sense of powerlessness. As we have seen in the past, these reactions are not correlated to factual evidence or even specific local experience. The Brexit vote was above all motivated by a hostility to immigration. But those voting on these grounds often live in places with low immigration, just as anti-Semitism in the past did not result from proximity to Jewish people.\u201cTake back control\u201d in Britain and \u201cMake America great again\u201d are, then, calls for a re-regulation of the space of appearance to exclude certain groups.When Trump speaks of a wall, his followers understand this to mean both a physical structure (which may or may not actually be constructed) and, more importantly, a conceptual exclusion from participation.There is no \u201ccommon ground\u201d between the politics of appearance and those of exclusion. In the United States, as the Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza has noted, \u201cwhen black people get free, everybody gets free.\u201d Which means that unless black people get free, nobody gets free. Until and unless there is a politics of recognition that might form a new space of appearance that is not structured on exclusion, there will be no liberation.But the resurgent politics of exclusion sometimes overwhelms our sense of that necessity. We seek expedient solutions and look to established leaders. Brexit showed that the defense of what W.E.B. Du Bois called the psychological \u201cwage\u201d of whiteness, its relative privileges, was more important to the majority population than actual economics. If Hillary Clinton fails to realize that it is no longer \u201cthe economy, stupid,\u201d a second reactionary victory might occur.Talk of tolerance and diversity has failed. The urgent task at hand, especially for people who are not themselves black, is to construct an anti-racist politics that is a common good. As Dr. King long ago realized, such politics can only work in tandem with anti-poverty and antiwar strategies. In the end, it comes down to this: When we see another person, do we see them as another human being, not just equal to us in law, but someone that we can listen to, learn from and fall in love with? Or not?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Simple Test to Dispel the Illusion Behind Stock Buybacks", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameStock investors have had one sweet summer so far watching the markets edge higher. With the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index at record highs and nearing 2,200, what\u2019s not to like?Here\u2019s something. As shares climb, so too do the prices companies are paying to repurchase their stock. And the companies doing so are legion.The buyback beat goes on even as complaints about these deals intensify. Some critics say that top managers who preside over big stock repurchases are failing at one of their most basic tasks: allocating capital so their businesses grow.Even worse, buybacks can be a way for executives to make a company\u2019s earnings per share look better because the purchases reduce the amount of stock it has outstanding. And when per-share earnings are a sizable component of executive pay, the motivation to do buybacks only increases.\u201cExecutives who get into that mode of thinking no longer have the ability to even think about how to invest in their companies for the long term,\u201d Mr. Lazonick said in an interview. \u201cCompanies that grow to be big and productive can be more productive, but they have to be reinvesting.\u201dBroadly speaking, those reinvestments appear to be in decline. Indeed, economists are concerned about the comparatively low levels of business investment since the economy emerged from the downturn more than seven years ago. This phenomenon may be attributable in part to the buyback binge.One of the best arguments against stock repurchases is that they offer only a one-time gain while investing intelligently in a company\u2019s operations can generate years of returns.\u201cThe simplest way to evaluate a company\u2019s asset allocation decisions over the years is to see whether its net profit growth is close to its earnings-per-share growth,\u201d Mr. Colby said. \u201cUnlike an investment in the business, share buybacks have no effect on net profit and there is no compounding in future years.\u201dMr. Colby has developed an illuminating analysis that identifies a crucial difference between many truly successful companies and their underperforming counterparts. The exercise highlights the growth mirage that buybacks have on earnings-per-share measures. In addition, it shows that returns on investment need not be that large for a company to generate growth rates exceeding the evanescent earnings-per-share gains associated with buybacks.In his test, Mr. Colby compared net profit growth and earnings-per-share gains at pairs of companies in the same industries from 2008 through 2015. In each case, he contrasted a company that bought back loads of shares during the period with another that did not.Cracker Barrel passed the net profit test ably: Its growth in earnings per share over those years was 13.6 percent a year while its net income grew at a virtually identical 14 percent.Jack in the Box made quite a contrast. Its annual earnings per share rose by 6 percent over the period, but its net profit declined by 0.5 percent a year.To bring its net profit to the level of growth it showed in per-share earnings, Mr. Colby said, Jack in the Box would have had to generate after-tax returns of only 4.8 percent on the $1.2 billion it spent buying back shares. That doesn\u2019t seem insurmountable.Linda Wallace, a spokeswoman for Jack in the Box, said the company\u2019s business model generated significant cash flow, \u201cwhich our shareholders have told us they prefer to be returned to them in the form of share repurchases and dividends.\u201dShe added that the average price the company paid to buy back its stock during the period was just under $37 a share, well below Friday\u2019s closing price of $98.93.Another notable buyback comparison was between Costco and Target, two large discount retailers. While Costco spent $2.7 billion to repurchase shares from 2008 through 2015, Target allocated $11.4 billion, reducing its share count by 20 percent.Costco\u2019s annual earnings-per-share gains of 9 percent during the period were almost identical to its 8.9 percent net profit growth.Target\u2019s numbers tell a different story. On the strength of its repurchases, Target\u2019s earnings per share rose by 7.3 percent each year. Its annual net profit growth was just 4.3 percent, Mr. Colby found.To close that gap, Mr. Colby calculated the after-tax investment returns Target would have had to generate on the $11.4 billion it spent on buybacks. The answer was a surprisingly nominal 5 percent.Erin Conroy, a Target spokeswoman, said the company\u2019s capital allocation priorities focus on \u201cgrowing long-term shareholder value and supporting our enterprise strategy.\u201d She cited Target\u2019s practice of annual dividend increases and said that last year, the company added an infrastructure and investment committee to its board to provide more oversight of investments.The net profit test, said Gary Lutin, a former investment banker who heads the forum, \u201ccuts through to the essential logic of comparing a process that grows a bigger pie \u2014 reinvestment \u2014 to a process that divides a shrunken pie among fewer people: share buybacks.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious,\u201d he continued, \u201cthat even mediocre returns from reinvesting in the production of goods and services will beat what\u2019s effectively a liquidation plan.\u201dInvestors may be dazzled by the earnings-per-share gains that buybacks can achieve, but who really wants to own a company in the process of liquidating itself? Maybe it\u2019s time to ask harder questions of corporate executives about why their companies aren\u2019t deploying their precious resources more effectively elsewhere.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the TPP Deal Won\u2019t Improve Our Security", "Date": "2016-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThis administration, like previous ones, has played this card repeatedly, and it\u2019s one reason the TPP has gotten as far as it has. But the national security case has always been weaker than the president and his allies insist.In the fall of 2009, I was invited to the White House with a few other think-tank analysts to discuss the deal, then still in its early stages. I pointed out that among the seven other countries then in discussion, we already had free trade deals with all but Brunei, New Zealand, Malaysia and Vietnam, and that these were all tiny economies that didn\u2019t seem to offer much potential economic gain to America. Moreover, all of these countries were members, along with the United States, of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group, which was committed to free trade in the Asia-Pacific region by 2020. What was the point? I asked.The response from the administration officials in the meeting was, in essence, \u201cgeopolitics\u201d: that many of our friends in Asia were feeling neglected by America, and that it was being pushed aside in the region by China. Without a sign of American strength in the area, China might step into the vacuum.But, I replied, the United States had never left. The Seventh Fleet has been patrolling the waters of East and Southeast Asia since World War II, and America has had at least 100,000 troops based in Asia for just as long. And, trade deals or not, America had enormous, chronic trade deficits with most countries in the region, guaranteeing economic and political engagement for decades to come. If the combination of the American military presence and their trade surpluses with the United States weren\u2019t enough to mollify Asian leaders, no free trade deal would significantly change the situation.What was true then is even truer today. The president often speaks of the TPP as a tool that will prevent China from writing the rules of trade for the future. But even as we negotiate the TPP, China is negotiating its Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership with all the Asia-Pacific TPP countries, as well as South Korea, the Philippines, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Indonesia, Myanmar and India. That deal may not be as sophisticated or comprehensive as the TPP, but that isn\u2019t preventing all the Asia-Pacific countries from rushing to sign up, just as they have for China\u2019s new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. It\u2019s already clear that the TPP is not going to stop China from writing some of the future rules of world trade.A key reason is that Washington no longer has a great deal to offer. In the days of Pax Americana, America could use trade deals to buy allies and geopolitical influence. Offering free and largely nonreciprocal access to the huge American market, coverage under the American defense umbrella and American foreign direct investment \u2014 along with transfer of production and technology by major American companies \u2014 all in return for geopolitical cooperation was a great deal.But those days are over. The American market is open to virtually all comers; what tariffs remain are small hurdles for countries looking for American consumers. The United States still has significant technology and intellectual capital, but it\u2019s no longer alone in that category. And whereas all trade roads once led to (or through) the United States, today it is just one part of a global network of supply chains.If anything, America is too often at the end of those chains, as the global consumer of last resort. It\u2019s not investing in domestic, let alone global, infrastructure. It is the world\u2019s largest debtor, and its role in the world economy is primarily to borrow and consume. It is hugely dependent on China to fund its borrowing. Were it not for the fact that the dollar is the main global currency and that Washington can still borrow in the dollars it prints, the country would have gone bankrupt long ago.In comparison to this, China is now by several important measures the world\u2019s largest economy, with about $4 trillion of reserves that it is investing in global infrastructure like the One Belt, One Road project, a multidecade, multitrillion-dollar effort to better connect China with markets in the Middle East, Europe and other parts of Asia. It is now the biggest foreign investor in most of the developing countries of Latin America, Africa and the Middle East. It is also the biggest foreign investor in Australia and much of Europe.In other words, the administration is absolutely right that America needs tools to counter China\u2019s growing influence in Asia and around the world. But until America can come close to matching China\u2019s dynamism, it has no hope of countering its economic and geopolitical influence with old-fashioned trade agreements, no matter how monumental they are said to be.Clyde Prestowitz, the founder and president of the Economic Strategy Institute, served in the Commerce Department under President Ronald Reagan and was vice chairman of President Bill Clinton\u2019s Commission on Trade and Investment in the Asia Pacific Region.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Olympic Games Exceeded Low Expectations", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn OlympicsRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The last day of the Olympics was windy and intermittently rainy: not quite beach weather.But the time had come. With the closing ceremonies imminent, Sunday was no-regrets day, the moment to check all the boxes you should have checked earlier, which meant it was time to go into the ocean off Copacabana Beach.I grew up around the sea in Honolulu and San Diego and have swum and bodysurfed in all sorts of places, but in Rio, I have to admit that the bad news got to me: polluted water in the lagoons and bays; super bacteria and floating debris; municipal cleanup promises unkept.So, against my instincts, I decided to stay dry and when, a few days into the Olympics, it became clear that so many others \u2014 Cariocas and tourists alike \u2014 were not making the same decision, I stuck with it as a form of self-sanction: a reminder that the negative backbeat leading into an Olympics so often ends up feeling out of tune, as the Olympics start making their own music.Despite covering every Games since 1992, I had still fallen for it. Exhibit A was the four cans of mosquito repellent, bought in the United States, that were sitting unused on a table in my hotel room, a still life to fear. This is not to imply that the Zika virus has not been a major issue in Rio or that water pollution in Guanabara Bay does not remain one. But it is to make clear that a lot of us in my business got it wrong when it came to the impact those issues would have on the Olympics themselves.\u201cAll we do is read what\u2019s in the headlines, and the headlines always scare you,\u201d said Bubba Watson, one of the leading golfers who did elect to play in the Games when many opted out.Rio deserved a more balanced, less hysterical prologue, just as it deserves a more balanced, less triumphal epilogue.That the Rio organizers and the International Olympic Committee avoided major drama should not be nearly enough to suggest that the Rio Games were a major success: only that the bar had been set so low that public expectations were surpassed.That was true for Brazilians as well as outsiders. Relief and the release of pent-up pride were the dominant sentiments I encountered in the final days, helped along by gold medals in men\u2019s soccer and men\u2019s volleyball: two sports that mean much more to Brazilians than the traditional Olympic staple of track and field.The Olympics, like many a human endeavor, remain an expectation game. Under-promise and over-deliver truly is great advice. Though Rio\u2019s and Brazil\u2019s leadership promised plenty, outsiders, including the I.O.C. itself, sounded so many alarm bells that athletes and visitors arrived ready to roll with difficulties in a way they never would have if, say, Chicago had been awarded the Games instead of Rio.Who knew then that Brazil\u2019s seemingly stable economy would fall off a cliff?Whatever the pronouncements from Thomas Bach, the I.O.C. president, who struggled to find the right tone in Rio, there is no way that the I.O.C. would have made the same decision seven years ago if it had known then what it knows now.Bringing this particular Olympics to the finish line was often as much fun as a foreclosure, and while the daily oversight meetings involving the I.O.C. and the local organizing committee quickly became pro forma in the second week of the Summer Games in Beijing and London, they remained all too substantive and necessary down to the wire in Rio.Imagine how much worse it could have been if Brazil had not had the experience of staging soccer\u2019s World Cup in 2014?Unfortunately Brazil\u2019s double act on the global stage did not work out as planned. It did not announce a country ready to flex its political and economic muscle on a grander scale but rather provided further evidence that Brazilians \u2014 remarkably resilient and welcoming people \u2014 still know how to muddle through. It was also, as Sebasti\u00e1n Fest wrote in Argentina\u2019s La Nacion, a missed opportunity to dismantle the stereotype of \u201cimprovisational, disorganized Latin Americans.\u201dBut under duress, Rio still did a remarkable job even if there were too many empty seats and there was too little Olympic atmosphere in too many venues. There was also an extraordinary degree of behind-the-scenes intervention required from the I.O.C. and the international sports federations.\u201cI think the I.O.C. will be out of the risk business for a while and really looking at as safe and secure bids as they can for the future,\u201d said Michael Payne, a former IOC marketing director who was a consultant on Rio\u2019s Olympic bid. \u201cThe delivery of these Games in the end has all come together, but the process of getting it there has strained the system to the limit. I wouldn\u2019t treat it as retrenchment. The Olympic journey is a long journey. I\u2019d treat it as the whole system catching its breath.\u201dThe question is whether it was worth it, above all for Rio?Payne and others think Rio will still get a tourism bump down the road because of the spectacular images of the city and Copacabana\u2019s beach-party atmosphere that were seen worldwide. There will also be legacy: a new metro line and improved transport system; some modern stadiums and a public golf course that drew rave reviews during the Games.But Juliana Barbassa, a Brazilian and longtime Rio correspondent who wrote \u201cDancing With the Devil in the City of God\u201d about Rio\u2019s Olympic journey, thinks it was, on balance, a bad bargain. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was worth it honestly,\u201d she said in Rio on Monday. \u201cI feel about this moment we are living now the same way I did immediately after the World Cup. Essentially you have a lot of people saying, \u2018You naysayers said this was going to be terrible and a disaster and look, we had a wonderful time. People had fun in Rio; the Games went off as they were supposed to.\u2019\u201cBut my argument was never that we couldn\u2019t stage a big international event. Of course we can. We have the engineers and the logistical experts. The problem always was: Is this the best use of money and political effort and energy for the city of Rio? And I continue to argue that it wasn\u2019t. Experts have reached different numbers on the total costs: 12, 13 billion, even 20 billion dollars. That could have easily been spent on infrastructure or on programs that would have made a huge difference in the lives of millions of people.\u201dBut absent the Olympic project and deadline, it is uncertain whether a significant fraction of that money would have been available to improve those lives.The Olympics are not eternal as the ancient Greeks proved. They work only as long as the world believes they are worth the trouble, and these are hardly boom times after a terribly wasteful and morally bankrupt Winter Olympics in Sochi in 2014 followed by the socioeconomic concerns generated in Rio.Tokyo in 2020, which has had its own budgetary issues, still looks like a comparative haven. Paris and Los Angeles look like the front-runners for 2024. The IOC already has done a lot of re-examination: see its so-called Agenda 2020, which examined, among other items, bidding and the Olympic sports program. But it still needs to do much more (Agenda 2024?) and needs to seriously examine the idea of creating a geographical rotation among permanent sites that are equipped to handle the Olympics without ripping up their cityscapes. The Winter Games, struggling to find hosts, need this just as much as the Summer Games.Rotation works well for major golf events like the British Open, providing variety and stability. It could work globally, too, even if the odds remain against it. I.O.C. members like that the Games can be a change agent, not just a mega sporting event. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Olympics make for a good urban transformation tool,\u201d Barbassa said. \u201cIt\u2019s a flawed model. Instead of a city\u2019s priorities taking precedence, it\u2019s the Olympic priorities that take precedence, and I think Rio is a perfect example of that.\u201dAnd as Rio reaffirmed with Usain Bolt and Simone Biles, it is the athletes, not the politicians, who distribute most of the magic dust. The setting is not nearly as important to the Olympics as their inspired victories, heartfelt failures and raw emotions; even less important in an era when television can make scattered venues feel unified to the viewer.The athletes came through again in Rio, and on Sunday afternoon despite the overcast skies, some made their way to Copacabana, posing for photos in their team gear in front of the now-empty beach volleyball arena or in front of messages they had drawn in the sand.There were roars from nearby bars and high-rise apartment windows that could be heard above the pounding surf: roars for Brazil\u2019s men\u2019s volleyball players\u2019 finishing off Italy to win the host nation\u2019s final gold medal.It was a crescendo finish to a discordant process, and as I slipped at last into the ocean and looked back at flawed, complex and beautiful Rio from the sea, it was easy to feel the buzz of the present; much harder to feel good about whatever comes next.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Explosion at Coal-Fired Plant in Central China Kills at Least 21", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 At least 21 people were killed and five injured by an explosion at a coal-fired power plant in central China on Thursday, according to official reports.The plant is owned by the Madian Gangue Power Generation Company, the website said. The company generates thermal power and sells slag, ash and petroleum products.A man who answered the telephone at the Dangyang government\u2019s propaganda office, who identified himself as Mr. Chen, said that an investigation was underway and that the government would release more details later.On Thursday night, Xinhua, the state news agency, said an initial investigation by the city found that the steam pipe had burst and started leaking during a debugging process for the power plant, which is still under construction.The plant uses coal gangue, also known as low-calorific coal, which is waste product from the mining and processing of coal.Although coal gangue has relatively low energy value, and is considered more harmful to the environment than other types of coal, some central government officials and some provincial governments have been encouraging the establishment of power plants that will burn coal gangue. Otherwise, it is left in piles at mine sites.At the same time, provincial governments have pressed ahead with approvals for building more coal-fired power plants, including ones that would use coal gangue.The construction boom can be traced to projects already underway, as well as to loopholes in policy that have allowed provincial officials and companies to receive approval for the plants.The plant-building boom will result in 400 gigawatts of excess capacity and a waste of more than $150 billion, because the plants are not needed to meet energy demand, Greenpeace said. China now has 910 gigawatts of coal-fired capacity and is expected to retire 70 gigawatts of that.A sign that there is excess capacity is that coal-fired power plants are operating for far fewer hours than in previous years and at well below their abilities.In a climate change agreement reached in 2014 with the United States, the Chinese government promised that 20 percent of its energy would come from sources other than fossil fuels by 2030.An earlier version of this article misstated part of the name of the power plant\u2019s owner. It is the Madian Gangue \u2014 not Gange \u2014 Power Generation Company.Vanessa Piao contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Waiting 8 Days in the Heat for a Career in Carpentry", "Date": "2016-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDawn on Monday began the eighth consecutive day that Glenn Hobbesland stood on the baking sidewalk in the West Village of Manhattan. There, for the past week of searing heat, he had slept in a pup tent pitched on the pavement to be among the first in a line of several hundred people seeking to join the carpenters\u2019 union.Whether camped out on lawn chairs under canopies, or toughing it out in the sun while pouring bags of ice over their heads, the men and some women were there to grab one of just 250 applications for an apprenticeship at the New York City District Council of Carpenters from an entrance on Clarkson Street. Without exception, they cursed the August heat. But they also spoke of deep anxiety in a world that seems perpetually about to teeter, and of the stability of a union job, which made sweating on the sidewalk bearable.\u201cYou want to make your way,\u201d Antonio Bond, 28, said from atop a camp chair midway down the line on Varick Street. It was a 94-degree Sunday afternoon, a day before the union doors would open. Folded behind his head was his 4-year-old son\u2019s Thomas the Tank Engine blanket, which he had brought from his home in the South Bronx. It was a reminder of why he was here looking for a career, not just a job, he said. \u201cYou could honestly say, \u2018I was a part of building New York City.\u2019\u201dThe crowd \u2014 some sharing burgers charred on portable grills, others rinsing off in a surreptitiously opened hydrant near Greenwich Street \u2014 was from a mix of backgrounds and social strata. In the program, those selected will spend four years undergoing classroom and on-the-job training, for which they are paid. There are currently about 1,500 apprentices, and over 70 percent of them are minorities, according to the union.\u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity,\u201d Walter Warzecha, the union\u2019s director of training, said in his office on Monday, out of the heat. \u201cEven in conditions like this.\u201dMr. Warzecha said the length of the line underscored the need for good jobs in a capricious economy. \u201cIt just shows how desperate people are to join the middle class,\u201d he said.\u201cWhat a skilled trade does is it teaches you something that no one can ever take away,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the appeal of it. That\u2019s why people wait for it for four days, five days.\u201dIn line were veterans, bartenders, mechanics, construction workers \u2014 and Tim Wynne. \u201cI don\u2019t do anything,\u201d said Mr. Wynne, 25, who lives in Goshen, N.Y., with his parents. He spends time reading, skateboarding and taking pictures, making little use of his degree in political science \u2014 though he lugged a biography of Theodore Roosevelt and \u201cMeditations\u201d by Marcus Aurelius to his curbside campsite.\u201cIt\u2019s immature. But I\u2019m changing,\u201d he said. \u201cLook at me! I\u2019m in this line.\u201dThose toward the beginning of the line had spent days together and had developed a camaraderie born of mutual suffering. Strangers held one another\u2019s place for bathroom breaks at a nearby Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, a quick shower at the Tony Dapolito Recreation Center on Clarkson Street, or a workout to stave off stiffness from sleeping on the sidewalk.At the front of the line, Mr. Hobbesland\u2019s mother came nightly from their family\u2019s home on Staten Island with dishes for her son like grilled chicken and pineapple, but she soon increased the portions to feed the 10 people in line beside him as well. (On Sunday, Day 7, the group greeted her with a chorus of, \u201cHi, Mom!\u201d)On Varick Street, a day before the doors opened, a cluster of people in line took turns describing the heat.\u201cIt was like you were in a sauna, and they had 10 blow-dryers on you,\u201d Marcus Rivera, 19, of Deer Park, N.Y., said.\u201cIt was like you were sitting on a steamy hot landfill of just garbage,\u201d Patrick Gilgan, 26, of Gerritsen Beach, Brooklyn, said.\u201cIt felt like we were inside a dragon\u2019s mouth,\u201d Moses Lamoney, 30, of Hempstead, N.Y., said. He had thought of quitting but stayed strong. \u201cIt\u2019s to better your life, period,\u201d he said.Shortly before 7 a.m. on Monday, tents were packed up and chairs were thrown over shoulders, and the long line shuffled down Clarkson Street, where at long last the union would be passing out the coveted applications. The completed applications will be put in a box and selected at random when there is a demand for apprentices throughout the year, until it is empty, at which point the application process \u2014 and the line \u2014 will start again.Jonathan Gardell, 29, had waited almost seven days. As he emerged from the union hall moments after putting in his application, his tired eyes filled with emotion.\u201cPeople here are searching for a future, in search of security, in search of hope. You don\u2019t get hope out there in New York City; it\u2019s a magic city, but it\u2019s hard,\u201d he said before turning to embrace the group of men with whom he had braved the grueling week. \u201cFinally, I am beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "I Ran the C.I.A. Now I\u2019m Endorsing Hillary Clinton.", "Date": "2016-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorDuring a 33-year career at the Central Intelligence Agency, I served presidents of both parties \u2014 three Republicans and three Democrats. I was at President George W. Bush\u2019s side when we were attacked on Sept. 11; as deputy director of the agency, I was with President Obama when we killed Osama bin Laden in 2011.I am neither a registered Democrat nor a registered Republican. In my 40 years of voting, I have pulled the lever for candidates of both parties. As a government official, I have always been silent about my preference for president.No longer. On Nov. 8, I will vote for Hillary Clinton. Between now and then, I will do everything I can to ensure that she is elected as our 45th president.Two strongly held beliefs have brought me to this decision. First, Mrs. Clinton is highly qualified to be commander in chief. I trust she will deliver on the most important duty of a president \u2014 keeping our nation safe. Second, Donald J. Trump is not only unqualified for the job, but he may well pose a threat to our national security.I spent four years working with Mrs. Clinton when she was secretary of state, most often in the White House Situation Room. In these critically important meetings, I found her to be prepared, detail-oriented, thoughtful, inquisitive and willing to change her mind if presented with a compelling argument.I also saw the secretary\u2019s commitment to our nation\u2019s security; her belief that America is an exceptional nation that must lead in the world for the country to remain secure and prosperous; her understanding that diplomacy can be effective only if the country is perceived as willing and able to use force if necessary; and, most important, her capacity to make the most difficult decision of all \u2014 whether to put young American women and men in harm\u2019s way.Mrs. Clinton was an early advocate of the raid that brought Bin Laden to justice, in opposition to some of her most important colleagues on the National Security Council. During the early debates about how we should respond to the Syrian civil war, she was a strong proponent of a more aggressive approach, one that might have prevented the Islamic State from gaining a foothold in Syria.I never saw her bring politics into the Situation Room. In fact, I saw the opposite. When some wanted to delay the Bin Laden raid by one day because the White House Correspondents Dinner might be disrupted, she said, \u201cScrew the White House Correspondents Dinner.\u201dIn sharp contrast to Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump has no experience on national security. Even more important, the character traits he has exhibited during the primary season suggest he would be a poor, even dangerous, commander in chief.These traits include his obvious need for self-aggrandizement, his overreaction to perceived slights, his tendency to make decisions based on intuition, his refusal to change his views based on new information, his routine carelessness with the facts, his unwillingness to listen to others and his lack of respect for the rule of law.The dangers that flow from Mr. Trump\u2019s character are not just risks that would emerge if he became president. It is already damaging our national security.President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was a career intelligence officer, trained to identify vulnerabilities in an individual and to exploit them. That is exactly what he did early in the primaries. Mr. Putin played upon Mr. Trump\u2019s vulnerabilities by complimenting him. He responded just as Mr. Putin had calculated.Mr. Putin is a great leader, Mr. Trump says, ignoring that he has killed and jailed journalists and political opponents, has invaded two of his neighbors and is driving his economy to ruin. Mr. Trump has also taken policy positions consistent with Russian, not American, interests \u2014 endorsing Russian espionage against the United States, supporting Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and giving a green light to a possible Russian invasion of the Baltic States.In the intelligence business, we would say that Mr. Putin had recruited Mr. Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation.Mr. Trump has also undermined security with his call for barring Muslims from entering the country. This position, which so clearly contradicts the foundational values of our nation, plays into the hands of the jihadist narrative that our fight against terrorism is a war between religions.In fact, many Muslim Americans play critical roles in protecting our country, including the man, whom I cannot identify, who ran the C.I.A.\u2019s Counterterrorism Center for nearly a decade and who I believe is most responsible for keeping America safe since the Sept. 11 attacks.My training as an intelligence officer taught me to call it as I see it. This is what I did for the C.I.A. This is what I am doing now. Our nation will be much safer with Hillary Clinton as president.Michael J. Morell was the acting director and deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency from 2010 to 2013.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Are We Loving Our National Parks to Death?", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionWALPOLE, N.H. \u2014 THOUSANDS of people are expected to gather at the north entrance to Yellowstone National Park on Aug. 25 to celebrate a uniquely American idea. The National Park Service turns 100 years old, and its birthday party will take place under a stone arch emblazoned with the words \u201cFor the benefit and enjoyment of the people.\u201dNo nation had ever set aside such a magnificent place for that reason. Wild reserves had been the exclusive property of nobility or the rich. Decisions by Congress to protect Yellowstone and other wonders reflected a different idea: In a democracy, such landscapes should belong to everyone.But that idea included a challenge: Places like Yellowstone must also be \u201cpreserved,\u201d as President Theodore Roosevelt urged his fellow citizens, for our \u201cchildren and their children\u2019s children forever, with their majestic beauty all unmarred.\u201dThat tension between access and preservation has become ever more strained today.The fear that the nation\u2019s parks might be \u201cloved to death\u201d is not new, only more pronounced.In Yellowstone\u2019s early years, visitors dumped laundry soap into geysers in hopes of making the eruptions more spectacular. Poachers slaughtered the nation\u2019s remnant bison herd, which dwindled to a few dozen animals before new laws brought it to a halt.Concerns about cars and the crowds they bring were raised by the great conservationist John Muir more than a century ago. He worried about the \u201cblunt-nosed mechanical beetles\u201d that might \u201cmingle their gas-breath\u201d with the fresh air of Yosemite (though he acknowledged they might help create more park allies by increasing the number of visitors).It was Conrad Wirth, a park service director, who 60 years ago warned that the parks were in danger of being \u201cloved to death.\u201d Families arriving in station wagons filled with baby boomer children were flooding into the parks. Congress responded with $1 billion for building campgrounds, hotels, restrooms and parking lots, fixing deteriorating roads and establishing visitor education centers.Today, some of the most overwhelmed places \u2014 like Zion, Acadia, Grand Canyon and Yosemite \u2014 are encouraging (and in some cases, requiring) visitors to park their cars near the entrances and tour the park in shuttle buses. Other approaches to limiting daily visitors, from increasing entry fees or requiring reservations, may be considered at some parks, but will need to be balanced against the founding idea that these parks exist for the public\u2019s benefit and enjoyment.The parks have become a political target as well. In the West, some politicians are demanding that the federal government return public lands to the states and localities. And there are continued threats in Congress to take away the president\u2019s unilateral authority to protect endangered places under the 1906 Antiquities Act. Places like Grand Canyon and Grand Teton National Parks, most of the Alaska\u2019s national parks, and many more, would not have been saved without that law.Money, too, remains a problem. The parks have endured a history marked more by congressional indifference and occasional hostility than by generosity. A $12 billion backlog for maintenance and improvements awaits funding. Fewer permanent employees now work for the park service than in 2002, even as it administers more parks and deals with record numbers of visitors.Increased philanthropy can help, but only at the margins. Higher entrance fees may be considered, but they can\u2019t fill the widening budget gap; and if fees become too high, they will defeat the whole democratic notion that the parks belong to everyone.What\u2019s needed is a public groundswell that translates the people\u2019s demonstrated affection for their parks into action that will safeguard the future of these places. It means demanding that our representatives provide the money needed to take care of these treasured, sacred places.When he helped lay the cornerstone of Yellowstone\u2019s arch in 1903, President Roosevelt called the park idea \u201cnoteworthy in its essential democracy\u201d and later wrote that it is \u201cone of the best bits of national achievement which our people have to their credit.\u201d Building on that achievement, and preserving the parks\u2019 \u201cessential democracy,\u201d will be the task of the park service\u2019s next hundred years.But without a new generation of park champions who recognize that the legacy they have inherited includes an obligation to nurture it, the park idea \u2014 which the writer Wallace Stegner called \u201cthe best idea we ever had\u201d \u2014 will wither away.Jon Jarvis, the park service director, wants visitors and the park rangers who greet them to more fully represent \u201cthe faces of America.\u201d National parks are no longer just scenic landscapes. They include equally compelling places that preserve the complicated mosaic of our history \u2014 like national monuments to Harriet Tubman, C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez and the Stonewall Inn \u2014 where we can learn and remember what it means to be an American.These parks belong to all of us. We should all visit them and enjoy them. With more champions of our parks, we can love them to renewed life instead of to death.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Sotheby\u2019s Found a Path to Higher Profits", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The art auction business has been a challenging one over the past decade or so. As art prices soared, the big international houses gambled with guarantees and sacrificed commissions to attract the most valuable lots, squeezing their own margins.Sotheby\u2019s rival, the privately owned Christie\u2019s, said auction sales were $2.5 billion over the equivalent six months, a drop of 37.5 percent.Mike Goss, Sotheby\u2019s chief financial officer, said at the earnings call for investors and analysts that the company\u2019s auction commission margin had increased to 16.4 percent in the second quarter, up from 15.5 percent in the equivalent period last year.Mr. Goss attributed the improvement to \u201ca shift in mix toward lower price bands\u201d and to a lesser extent \u201cgreater pricing discipline.\u201d\u201cGuarantees on masterworks have generally proven to be attritional to earnings, but in the past they did buy market share,\u201d said Neal Meltzer, an art adviser in New York. \u201cWinning the sale of the Taubman collection was vital to maintaining respect for the Sotheby\u2019s brand.\u201d\u201cSotheby\u2019s has held the line,\u201d said Guy Jennings, managing director of the Fine Art Fund Group in London. \u201cThey haven\u2019t allowed consignors to eat into their margins.\u201d\u201cPictures at $70 million are good P.R., but the revenues are in the middle market,\u201d he said, where sellers tend to pay full commissions and guarantees are nearly unheard of. \u201cThat\u2019s the most lucrative way to do business.\u201dSotheby\u2019s results cheered investors. In after-hours trading Thursday, it was at $40 a share, up from its Aug. 5 price of $32.28. Back in February, it had sunk as low as $19.13.\u201cDespite the overall drop in auction sales last year, the Asian market remains the biggest in the world,\u201d said Wendy Cromwell, an art adviser in New York. \u201cThis investment can potentially open new avenues for profitability for Sotheby\u2019s.\u201dIn announcing the acquisition, Tad Smith, Sotheby\u2019s president and chief executive, said it would help improve the company\u2019s \u201cleadership position at the high end of the fine art market, bolstering our private sales capability, giving us new growth opportunities in advisory services and reinforcing the client-first culture in all we do.\u201dIn the first half of 2016, year-on-year private sales declined 33 percent to $249.6 million. But Sotheby\u2019s S.E.C. filing does register $3.4 million of income from advisory fees \u2014 though the company did have to pay Art Agency, Partners $4.4 million in compensation for the privilege. Still, since the merger, Sotheby\u2019s has managed to secure the prime consignment of an otherwise thin-looking November auction season in New York \u2014 the collection of paintings owned by the New York collector and philanthropist Steven Ames, who died in March, and his wife, Ann.To do so, Sotheby\u2019s offered a guarantee, and has estimated the collection at around $100 million. It includes two 1980s Gerhard Richter abstracts, each expected to sell for at least $20 million, and a 1976-77 Willem de Kooning painting, which has yet to be formally estimated. Mr. Smith said in the Monday earnings call that Sotheby\u2019s intended to hedge some of the Ames guarantees with third-party investors.So, Sotheby\u2019s would appear to be shipshape, ready for whatever geopolitical storms blow at the art market.\u201cI wonder how much of this was fortuitous,\u201d said Steven Blitz, the chief economist at ITG Investment Research, a brokerage firm in New York. \u201cThey\u2019ve kind of fallen into a situation where the average hammer prices were lower and the commissions were higher. It\u2019s not a strong market.\u201d\u201cSotheby\u2019s stock is a macro trade,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the global economy goes into recession, it will lose money.\u201d\u201cBut it will survive and come back, if it\u2019s not overloaded with debt,\u201d he added. \u201cThey have kept control of costs. There\u2019s nothing magical about it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Today\u2019s Inequality Could Easily Become Tomorrow\u2019s Catastrophe", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewEconomic inequality is already a concern, but it could become a nightmare in the decades ahead, and I fear that we are not well equipped to deal with it.Truly extreme gaps in income and wealth could arise from many causes. Consider just a few: Innovations in robotics and artificial intelligence, which are already making many jobs uncompetitive, could lead us into a world in which basic work with decent pay becomes impossible to find. An environmental disaster like global warming, pollution or disease could sharply reduce the ability of people of ordinary means to live in specific regions or entire countries.Future wars using ever more highly destructive technology, including chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear weapons, could devastate vast populations. And it\u2019s not out of the question that dire political changes, like the rise of racist or otherwise exclusionary social structures, could have terribly damaging consequences for less privileged people.Of course, I dearly hope none of these things ever happen. But even if they are unlikely, as part of our progress to a better world, we should be thinking now of how we might address them.The private sector isn\u2019t helping much, either. It has not gone very far in developing insurance or hedging markets to protect against these risks. That raises an important question: Can we depend on the benevolence of society to compensate and care for those who would lose out if dire events actually happened?Instead, they found that taxes tend to rise when warfare increases, largely \u201cbecause war mobilization changed beliefs about tax fairness.\u201d These tax changes were generally aimed at ensuring national survival, not correcting economic inequalities.Professor Scheve and Professor Stasavage found that democratic countries have not consistently embraced more redistributive tax policies, and most people do not vote strictly in their narrow self-interest. As the right to vote broadened through the centuries, for example, and people without property began to vote, they did not consistently act to tax the rich. These findings run counter to a popular narrative. Recall that in 2012, Mitt Romney said that in a democracy, a candidate who offers tax breaks to the less well-off at the expense of the rich will win mass support \u201cno matter what.\u201d That claim does not appear to be supported by the historical record.Instead, it appears that, for better or for worse, the majority of people share simple notions of entitlement and fairness. Professor Scheve, Professor Stasavage and their colleagues found that in 2014, when people in the United States were asked what marginal tax rates they would \u201cmost like to see\u201d on family incomes of $375,000, the median answer was 30 percent, with the bulk of answers ranging from 20 percent to 40 percent. (The federal marginal tax rate for that income is 33 percent.)For example, Angus Deaton of Princeton, commenting on what he called the \u201cgrotesque expansions in inequality of the past 30 years,\u201d gave a pessimistic prediction: \u201cThose who are doing well will organize to protect what they have, including in ways that benefit them at the expense of the majority. \u201d And Robert M. Solow of M.I.T. said, \u201cWe are not good at large-scale redistribution of income.\u201d Both Professor Deaton and Professor Solow are fellow Nobel laureates.Robert J. Shiller is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "M\u00f3nica Puig, Puerto Rico\u2019s Favorite Daughter (and Only Gold Medalist)", "Date": "2016-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN JUAN, P.R. \u2014 Before she played in her last tennis tournament, M\u00f3nica Puig was pretty much like anyone else at San Juan International Airport.Her grandparents would drop her off curbside and she would wait at the gate area flipping though her phone just like anyone else, save for the occasional moments when someone recognized her and asked for a photo.But after her last tournament, at the Rio Olympics, no trip to Puerto Rico will be the same.When she landed at the airport this week, carrying the first Olympic gold medal in Puerto Rico\u2019s history, she was met by thousands of cheering fans, a retinue of three beefy security guards and an escort of several police cars and motorcycles with lights flashing.As her motorcade drove through San Juan, people poured into the streets to greet her, even as it passed the hardscrabble Luis Llorens Torres housing project, where baseball and basketball players and boxers are usually the most idolized stars.But in the span of a week, Puig went from a little-known curiosity here \u2014 the girl born in San Juan who went to Miami and became a professional tennis player \u2014 to a hero, with the island\u2019s first gold medal around her neck at age 22.\u201cI was stunned,\u201d Puig said in an interview at her San Juan hotel, about a mile from her grandmother\u2019s apartment, where she spent summers as a girl. \u201cThe support I am getting here is just indescribable. I didn\u2019t fully understand the weight of my actions until I got here.\u201dPuig\u2019s impromptu parade from the airport was followed by an organized version through the streets of San Juan on Tuesday that drew thousands of supporters. It was intended to commemorate the efforts of the entire Puerto Rican Olympic squad, but without Puig, there would have been no parade.With the United States Open set to begin Monday, Puig had only a few days to soak in the appreciation of Puerto Rico and the fans who had fallen in love with her.She stood at the front of a roofless double-decker bus, her gold medal dangling over the side, singing along with Puerto Rican pop tunes and waving to a grateful island.Waving back were grandmothers and awe-struck little girls holding red, white and blue flags; gritty bikers; business people pouring out of office buildings; and truckers, parked in their rigs and honking their horns. There were teenagers in tank tops; doctors, nurses, schoolchildren in uniform; and nuns in habits.One elderly man wore a crisp, new T-shirt with an image of Puig celebrating her gold medal victory and her motto Pica Power. He held a small cardboard sign that read, \u201cGracias, Monica.\u201d\u201cIt was the most incredible experience of my life,\u201d Puig said. \u201cObviously, I was overcome with emotion because you saw me crying up there. I could see it on their faces, what it meant to everyone. I felt so proud.\u201dBut Puerto Ricans here and abroad were united each time Puig took the court in Rio, the momentum building with every win.Unseeded and ranked No. 35, Puig drew scant interest for the first match she played. By the second match, people began to take notice. After she crushed No. 3 Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza, the French Open champion, in the third round, Puig had Puerto Rico\u2019s full attention.By the time she beat the two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova in the semifinals, she had captivated an island.Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez, also from San Juan, won gold in doubles in the 1992 and the 1996 Olympics, but she did it representing the United States.Before the Rio Games, Puerto Rico had captured only eight medals since it first entered the Olympics in 1948 \u2014 two silver and six bronze.When Puig stepped onto the court to play second-ranked Angelique Kerber in the gold medal match on Aug. 13, the streets across Puerto Rico were silent and empty, according to numerous reports and accounts of dozens of people here. But when she won, people came out on the balconies of apartment buildings waving flags and shouting, cars honked their horns and people in bars and restaurants danced and hugged.\u201cThe whole island came together,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like I united the island.\u201dShe added: \u201cI know that in Puerto Rico, not many people watch tennis or know what it is all about. But it is amazing how much a moment like that can mean for so many people.\u201dBut this, at its core, was a victory for the average Puerto Ricans to revel in. Javier Ortiz-Cort\u00e9s, a 48-year-old puppeteer from Bayam\u00f3n, was on a church mission in Nicaragua for the final, but found an internet signal and watched on his phone.\u201cIt is the greatest thing to happen to Puerto Rico,\u201d he said Wednesday near the beautiful public tennis courts in Parque Barbosa in San Juan. \u201cThat a young woman from Puerto Rico set her mind to a goal and reached it, it gives us hope. The people here are frustrated. But it feels like everyone in Puerto Rico has a gold medal because of her.\u201dPuig\u2019s sudden popularity is more remarkable considering tennis is not a big sport here. Baseball is considered the passion of the island, and basketball and boxing are immensely popular. Soccer, volleyball and maybe even judo and high-diving may rank higher than tennis.But Puig\u2019s mother, Astrid, played it as a girl in San Juan and earned a top ranking as a junior on the island, although she never played professionally. The Puig family moved to Miami when Monica was 1, but she and her brother returned regularly to spend summers with their grandparents.As her daughter\u2019s tennis improved in her teenage years, Astrid said, the family decided she would play for Puerto Rico, which offered more financial support than the United States Tennis Association did. But the money was contingent upon Puig\u2019s winning medals in events like the Pan American Games and the Central American Games.That may have etched the importance of medals in her mind. At 16, she won gold in the Central American Games, played in Puerto Rico, and last year she won bronze at the Pan American Games in Toronto.\u201cPlaying for Puerto Rico was the best decision I ever made,\u201d Puig said. \u201cI am so proud of my Puerto Rican roots. To pay off like this just reaffirms it.\u201dPuig struggled in 2015, and her ranking, once in the top 40, fell to No. 92 at the end of the year. This season, though, her road to Rio was paved with success. She reached the final at the Sydney event in January and the semifinals at Eastbourne in June to bring her into the top 40.Players are no longer awarded ranking points at the Olympics, but she seized something just as valuable there: confidence. It was buoyed after her 6-1, 6-1 victory over Muguruza and then soared when she stunned Kvitova in three sets in the semifinals.In the final, against Kerber, Puig said her nerves cost her the second set. But when she led, 5-1, in the third, she promised herself she would remain calm.\u201cThat was a big, fat lie,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was definitely the moment of my life. The most nerve-racking, scary, exciting mix of emotions I have ever felt. My hands were shaking.\u201dHer next stop is the United States Open, next week in New York. Puig knows she enjoys great support from people of Puerto Rican descent and from Caribbean nations. But she noted that now, after Rio, her appeal may broaden.\u201cI know this will probably be one to remember,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope I can go far enough to make it a good memory.\u201dIn less than a month, she obtained a lifetime of memories. On Tuesday in San Juan, the five-mile parade in her honor ended at the Coliseum of Puerto Rico, where she and the other Olympians danced and sang on stage in a jubilant celebration in front of thousands. Puig cried during her speech.Carlos Nido, a 35-year-old public defense lawyer from San Juan, took his two little girls to watch.\u201cThey are very young,\u201d he said. \u201cBut maybe someday they will play tennis, too.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Proposes to Double Hillary Clinton\u2019s Spending on Infrastructure", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDonald J. Trump took a step to Hillary Clinton\u2019s left on Tuesday, saying that he would like to spend at least twice as much as his Democratic opponent has proposed to invest in new infrastructure as part of his plan to stimulate the United States\u2019 economy.The idea takes a page out of the progressive playbook and is another indication that the Republican presidential nominee is prepared to break with the fiscal conservatism that his party has evangelized over the past eight years.\u201cWe have bridges that are falling down,\u201d Mr. Trump said on the Fox Business Network. \u201cWe have many, many bridges that are in danger of falling.\u201dAsked how he would pay for $800 billion to $1 trillion in infrastructure spending, Mr. Trump described a strategy that has been favored by liberal economists over the years. He said he would create an infrastructure fund that would be supported by government bonds that investors and citizens could purchase.\u201cWe\u2019re going to go out with a fund,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll get a fund, make a phenomenal deal with low interest rates and rebuild our infrastructure.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe\u2019d do infrastructure bonds from the country, from the United States.\u201dIf Mr. Trump\u2019s call for more spending sounds familiar, that could be because Lawrence H. Summers, who was President Bill Clinton\u2019s Treasury secretary and the director of President Obama\u2019s National Economic Council, has been saying the same thing. At a Democratic National Convention round table last week in Philadelphia, he said the United States should invest between $1 trillion and $2 trillion in infrastructure over the next 10 years.Conservative critics of Mr. Trump expressed concern that the idea would put the country deeper in debt and that it sounded alarmingly similar to Mr. Obama\u2019s 2009 stimulus program.\u201cI\u2019m old enough to remember when the people who supported Trump hated this idea when Obama proposed it,\u201d said Leon Wolf, a commentator on the conservative website Red State.Part of that plan, which Republicans opposed, was the issuance of \u201cBuild America Bonds,\u201d which allowed a broader group of investors to help finance infrastructure projects in states and cities.Although Mr. Trump has said he would use his prowess as a builder to redevelop infrastructure more efficiently than others could, an investment of $1 trillion could conflict with Mr. Trump\u2019s promises to reduce the deficit.\u201cYou\u2019d be increasing the deficit for a significant period of time if you were deploying that money,\u201d said Donald Marron, who was a member of President George W. Bush\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers.The Clinton campaign rejected the idea that Mr. Trump has serious ideas for rebuilding American infrastructure. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s only actual infrastructure proposal is to build a giant wall on the Mexican border and have Mexico pay for it,\u201d said Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton. \u201cOnly one candidate in this campaign has put forward a specific and credible plan for investing in our nation\u2019s infrastructure, and that\u2019s Hillary Clinton.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Terrorism Plan Mixes Cold War Concepts and Limits on Immigrants", "Date": "2016-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDonald J. Trump on Monday invoked comparisons to the Cold War era in arguing that the United States must wage an unrelenting ideological fight if it is to defeat the Islamic State. He said he would temporarily suspend immigration from \u201cthe most dangerous and volatile regions of the world\u201d and judge allies solely on their participation in America\u2019s mission to root out Islamic terrorism.In a speech at Youngstown State University in Ohio, a critical swing state where polls show him trailing Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump combined old vows to seize Middle Eastern oil fields with the announcement of a series of new, if still vague, proposals to change America\u2019s battlefield tactics.\u201cJust as we won the Cold War, in part by exposing the evils of communism and the virtues of free markets, so too must we take on the ideology of radical Islam,\u201d he said.He again tried to change his politically inflammatory approach to immigration, replacing his 2015 vow to bar Muslims from entering the United States with a new commitment to bar anyone from parts of the world where terrorism breeds. Once again, he did not name those countries, or say whether citizens of longtime allies where terrorists have plotted and executed attacks \u2014 Germany, France and Belgium among them \u2014 would be included.Mr. Trump, who has pledged to build a wall along the border with Mexico, also said he would call for \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of immigrants that would include requiring them to respond to a questionnaire with an \u201cideological test.\u201dOver all, he appeared to be arguing for the kind of terrorism-centric foreign policy that President George W. Bush adopted after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.But over time, that approach ran into complications: China and Russia used the fight against terrorism to crack down on Muslim minorities. And the Bush administration eventually discovered that a one-dimensional approach, measuring countries almost exclusively on their commitment to fighting Islamic terrorists, left it little leverage when their partners in counterterrorism took other steps opposed to American interests \u2014 from the Chinese claiming portions of the South China Sea to increasing Russian threats against former Soviet states.Monday\u2019s speech represented another attempt by Mr. Trump to focus on issues after a rocky period in his campaign, much as he did last Monday with a speech on the economy. He laid the blame for the rise of Islamic extremism on President Obama and Mrs. Clinton. He said they made \u201ca catastrophic mistake\u201d in \u201cthe reckless way in which they pulled out\u201d of Iraq. He charged that Mrs. Clinton compounded the error by attempting to \u201cbuild a democracy in Libya.\u201dHe argued \u2014 accurately \u2014 that Mrs. Clinton had been a vocal proponent of the American intervention in Libya in 2011, which Mr. Obama has repeatedly acknowledged was the most ill-thought-out foreign policy move in his nearly eight years in office. He also charged that \u201cHillary Clinton wants to be America\u2019s Angela Merkel,\u201d a reference to the German chancellor. Germany has taken in tens of thousands of refugees fleeing the civil war in Syria, in which fighting between forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, rebels opposed to his rule and Islamic State jihadists has claimed 400,000 lives.Mr. Trump offered no criticism of Mr. Assad, but criticized the Obama administration for advocating the removal of the Syrian leader and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, who was deposed in the first blush of the Arab Spring, because doing so took out the strongmen who kept the lid on violence in the region.He pledged to form a new partnership with Israel, Egypt and Jordan to try to stop the spread of terrorism, including groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah. He also suggested that the United States would be well served by joining forces with Russia against the Islamic State.An analysis of how a ban could be carried out and how many people would be affected.And though Mr. Trump made no reference to whether he would send more American troops back to the region, that appeared to be the clear implication.The kind of relentless attacks on the Islamic State he advocates \u2014 along with taking and holding the oil fields, which may well be a violation of international law \u2014 would require a considerable presence by American troops or their allies, and foreign bases to launch the drones.Peter Feaver, a former Bush administration official who handled Iraq strategy and now teaches at Duke University, and who has signed two letters from national security officials opposing Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, praised Mr. Trump for giving a \u201csurprisingly serious\u201d speech on counterterrorism.But he also said that \u201cgiven how vehemently Trump has denounced Bush\u2019s national security team, it is striking how much of this speech depends on counterterrorism ideas developed by the Bush administration. It is not a perfect copy \u2014 we never contemplated seizing the oil for our own purposes and we were far more concerned about how anti-Muslim rhetoric might demoralize the moderate Muslim voices we were seeking to empower. But the good parts are not new \u2014 they are imported from the Bush approach \u2014 and the new parts are not good.\u201dMr. Trump did not explain how his vision of \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of immigrants, including an \u201cideological test,\u201d would be enforced, or how it would be different from when prospective terrorists lie on questionnaires now. But he made clear that he views the recent terrorist attacks in the United States through the prism of immigration, pointing out that the common point between the shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla., and the mass attack in San Bernardino, Calif., was that they were carried out \u201cby immigrants, or the children of immigrants.\u201dAs part of the ideological battle against the Islamic State, he said, a Trump administration will \u201cbe a friend to all moderate Muslim reformers in the Middle East,\u201d and would speak out \u201cagainst the horrible practice of honor killings, where women are murdered by their relatives for dressing, marrying or acting in a way that violates fundamentalist teachings.\u201dJake Sullivan, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s policy chief, argued that Mr. Trump\u2019s concern about respecting minority rights within the Muslim religion was not sincere. \u201cThis so-called \u2018policy\u2019 cannot be taken seriously,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cHow can Trump put this forward with a straight face when he opposes marriage equality and selected as his running mate the man who signed an anti-L.G.B.T. law in Indiana? It\u2019s a cynical ploy to escape scrutiny of his outrageous proposal to ban an entire religion from our country, and no one should fall for it.\u201dIn his address, Mr. Trump said that if he is elected, \u201cthe era of nation-building will be ended,\u201d implicitly criticizing efforts to restore stability to Iraq and Afghanistan. He did not note that most of that nation-building began in the Bush administration, and much of it was terminated by President Obama.Mr. Trump was clearly defensive about challenges to his claim that he had opposed the invasion of Iraq, notably a Sept. 11, 2002, comment to Howard Stern, the radio host, in which he was asked whether he supported a future invasion of the country. \u201cYeah, I guess so,\u201d he responded, \u201cI wish the first time it was done correctly,\u201d a reference to the Persian Gulf war. The day of the invasion in 2003, he described it as a \u201ctremendous success from a military standpoint.\u201dBut in his speech, Mr. Trump quoted himself from an August 2004 statement to Esquire when the Iraq war was beginning to turn against the United States.\u201cIt turns out that all the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong,\u201d he said, 17 months after the invasion. \u201cAll this for nothing.\u201d He noted that he had warned that \u201ctwo minutes after we leave, there\u2019s going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy will take over.\u201dYamiche Alcindor contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Think Tank Scholar or Corporate Consultant? It Depends on the Day", "Date": "2016-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Over the many months that officials in Washington debated sweeping new regulations for internet providers, Jeffrey A. Eisenach, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, was hard to miss.And he has plenty of company.An examination of 75 think tanks found an array of researchers who had simultaneously worked as registered lobbyists, members of corporate boards or outside consultants in litigation and regulatory disputes, with only intermittent disclosure of their dual roles.With their expertise and authority, think tank scholars offer themselves as independent arbiters, playing a vital role in Washington\u2019s political economy. Their imprimatur helps shape government decisions that can be lucrative to corporations.But the examination identified dozens of examples of scholars conducting research at think tanks while corporations were paying them to help shape government policy. Many think tanks also readily confer \u201cnonresident scholar\u201d status on lobbyists, former government officials and others who earn their primary living working for private clients, with few restrictions on such outside work.Largely free from disclosure requirements, the researchers\u2019 work is often woven into elaborate corporate lobbying campaigns.And it is a decidedly bipartisan practice.The overlapping roles are often not made clear, and even members of Congress say they are frequently unaware of the financial ties between industries and the witnesses with think tank titles appearing before them at hearings.\u201cThey can make a very deceptive and false claim to credibility that is totally lacking,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who said he had become increasingly disturbed by the role of think tank experts on Capitol Hill. \u201cI think about it every time there is a witness now from a \u2018think tank,\u2019 putting that term in very boldface quotes.\u201dScholars sometimes include general references to their private-sector work in their official biographies. Mr. Eisenach, for example, notes that he is an executive at NERA Economic Consulting in addition to his position at the American Enterprise Institute. And when a private company pays him or his consulting firm to publish a study, he discloses the name of the corporate sponsor on the study.But there is no way for the public or policy makers to know Mr. Eisenach\u2019s full roster of NERA clients. And there is no comprehensive disclosure of these clients when he writes his think tank reports or academic papers, testifies before Congress, or meets with F.C.C. members or staff.Mr. Eisenach declined repeated requests to comment in detail. But a spokeswoman for the American Enterprise Institute, Judy Mayka Stecker, said she saw no conflict in his roles.\u201cWe believe in the open competition of ideas and encourage our scholars to engage with experts from all sectors and viewpoints,\u201d she said.A footnote on the first page of the letter indicated that none of the scholars who signed had been compensated by stakeholder companies. But of the dozen studies they submitted as evidence, more than half had been funded by telecommunications giants or based on other work for the companies, industry ties that were disclosed only in footnotes in the original studies.No federal rules required broader disclosure. Yet on many highly technical policy issues like telecommunications regulation, scholarship is dominated by industry-funded research, according to a review of hundreds of studies, regulatory filings and other documents.\u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re in legal and you want to have a paper that says what you want it to say,\u201d said Dennis Weller, a former Verizon economist who occasionally consults for telecommunications companies and international organizations. \u201cYou could have a bunch of economists in house and ask them if they agree with you. How much easier would it be to go to an outside economist and say, \u2018How about if I pay you $100,000 to write this?\u2019\u201dFew policy battles have had higher stakes in recent years than the debate over net neutrality \u2014 a catchall term for proposals to restrict internet service providers from blocking websites or regulating speed.To bolster their claims that the regulations would hurt consumers, companies have financed research that contends the rules would reduce investment in new services and raise prices. That work is used to shape the public debate and to build an industry-funded narrative in the regulatory record, one that the F.C.C. is required by law to evaluate.Industry-sponsored research has also figured prominently in court battles over F.C.C. efforts to regulate the internet. When Verizon successfully opposed an earlier F.C.C. rule on net neutrality, more than half of the 23 studies or expert declarations cited in court filings had been sponsored directly by telecommunications companies or trade associations, according to an analysis by The Times. Other studies had been published under the banner of think tanks but written by scholars who consulted extensively for companies.The attacks began to grow particularly heated nearly two years ago, when Mr. Obama called on Mr. Wheeler and his fellow F.C.C. commissioners to regulate the internet like traditional phone lines.The study mentioned their employment at Economists Incorporated, a consulting firm in Washington. But a reader would have had to do more research to learn that Economists Incorporated\u2019s clients included AT&T and Verizon, companies leading the industry\u2019s charge against the commission proposal. That was disclosed on a \u201cselect client list\u201d on the Economists Incorporated website.\u201cPeople who are running advertisements are not going to say, \u2018In a study we paid for,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Litan, now an adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cIn the public discourse, the disclaimers often do get dropped.\u201d\u201cNone of us works for free,\u201d Mr. Singer wrote. \u201cSo let\u2019s focus on the merits & be nice to each other!\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Singer said he \u2014 like most scholars \u2014 disclosed when a client commissioned a particular study published through his consulting firm. Most specialists in the telecommunications field, he suggested, are well aware of his business connections and views on regulatory issues.\u201cEverybody is on different teams,\u201d Mr. Singer said. \u201cSo long as you tell the audience what team you are on, you can then offer the opinions. Disclosure is the antidote to all of this.\u201dFew scholars have been as active in the net neutrality debate as Mr. Eisenach.\u201cJeff is good at linking big theoretical ideas to policy, and he\u2019s been good at making money doing that,\u201d said Mr. Weller, the former Verizon economist. \u201cHe\u2019s been good at moving from think tank to think tank and company to company, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever lost money doing it.\u201dAt a given moment, it can be difficult to determine which hat Mr. Eisenach is wearing.In September 2014, at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on net neutrality, the formal meeting agenda listed Mr. Eisenach as a visiting scholar at the institute.Scholar, consultant, expert witness \u2014 Jeffrey A. Eisenach has worn all these hats while playing a leading role in the debate over telecommunications policy in the United States. Here is a look at the potential conflicts that this situation creates for Mr. Eiensach, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.He then detailed his vehement opposition to further federal regulation of the internet.Mr. Eisenach was similarly ambiguous when he interacted with members of the F.C.C., according to dozens of emails obtained by The Times, all but one of which was sent from Mr. Eisenach\u2019s email address at the American Enterprise Institute.On behalf of the think tank, he sought meetings with F.C.C. commissioners and lawyers to discuss the rules, and briefed the commission\u2019s Republican members on what its general counsel was telling him about Mr. Wheeler\u2019s thinking. Mr. Eisenach offered speaking slots at American Enterprise Institute events to the two Republican members on the commission, urging one to use a January 2015 forum to speak out against the proposed regulations.Ms. Stecker, the institute spokeswoman, said it should be no surprise that the opinions of experts like Mr. Eisenach were in demand. The think tank requires scholars to submit an annual report on any \u201coutside activities,\u201d she added, and A.E.I. has \u201cnot as an institution sought to influence or constrain\u201d this work.While private consulting arrangements can leave scholars\u2019 ties to corporate interests murky, the conflict is more apparent when think tank researchers do double duty as registered lobbyists.Mr. Verdery, a former senior official at the Department of Homeland Security whose office helped run the inspection program at foreign airports, briefly mentioned that in addition to his status as a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, he was the founder of the Monument Policy Group.Officials at the Toronto airport, with Mr. Verdery\u2019s help, have been trying to persuade the American authorities to increase staff and equipment to reduce bottlenecks sometimes created by the preclearance program.Asked whether it was appropriate for a lobbyist to host his clients at a think tank event, Mr. Verdery said, \u201cIt is fairly typical.\u201dMr. Verdery is not paid by the think tank, he noted. He does benefit from the C.S.I.S. title, however, when laying out a client\u2019s case.As of late last year, at least 70 unpaid senior advisers and associates listed on the think tank\u2019s website had simultaneously worked as consultants. Seven others listed as C.S.I.S. senior advisers or associates during the past five years had worked as registered corporate lobbyists while holding the positions.Officials at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, when asked about Mr. Verdery, said his December presentation should not have occurred.\u201cThis event did not meet our standards of transparency and integrity,\u201d the think tank said in a statement in response to questions. \u201cThis constituted a lapse in oversight from C.S.I.S.\u201dMr. Verdery is no longer listed among the think tank\u2019s senior associates.Bruce Bartlett, a scholar who has worked at the Cato Institute and the Heritage Foundation, said it was becoming the norm in Washington for lobbyists and consultants like Mr. Verdery to vie for nonresident scholar posts to help them burnish sales pitches to corporate clients.\u201cClients prefer it that way,\u201d Mr. Bartlett said. \u201cThey get a chance to have their work done by scholars.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think they see any downside,\u201d Mr. Miller said of his corporate clients and the think tank.While Mr. Miller is not well known, he has high-profile company.Mr. Dorgan did not immediately register as a lobbyist, but his firm has oil and gas industry clients.Asked if his dual role represented a conflict of interest, Mr. Dorgan said that the premise of the Bipartisan Policy Center was \u201cto bring interested parties together to find solutions to difficult problems,\u201d and that he was proud to work there.Mr. Zakheim, of the American Enterprise Institute, is also a lobbyist at Covington & Burling L.L.P., where, on behalf of BAE Systems, he is urging Congress and the Defense Department to increase spending on ground combat vehicles that the company manufactures. Other clients include Northrop Grumman, which is building a new long-range Air Force bomber.Some scholars add another twist: They serve on corporate boards directly related to their areas of expertise at think tanks.Dr. McClellan, a former commissioner at the Food and Drug Administration who until January was a senior fellow at Brookings, has been a go-to expert for the federal government as it debates how to cope with surging costs of prescription drugs.At public events, Dr. McClellan emphasized the extraordinary progress by the pharmaceutical industry in coming up with treatments for diseases like diabetes, H.I.V. and hepatitis C.Dr. McClellan, in a statement, disputed any suggestion that he might have had a conflict.\u201cMy entire career in academics, government and public policy has focused on evidence-based ways to improve health and restrain costs for consumers, and my extensive track record speaks for itself,\u201d he said.She said that her change of heart on nuclear power had predated her engagement with Nuclear Matters, and was motivated by her desire to combat climate change, not by payment from the industry.\u201cObviously, the single most important thing any individual has is their reputation,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cI have worked really hard to be forthcoming about what I stand for and believe in. I am who I am.\u201dAdam S. Posen, the president of the Peterson Institute, considered the world\u2019s pre-eminent think tank on global economics, has a commanding view of the construction of the new headquarters for the American Enterprise Institute, as well as the main office of Brookings. In his office, he recently had a series of uncomfortable conversations with three scholars he had decided to let go.After much internal debate, Mr. Posen decided to formally prohibit Peterson\u2019s scholars from holding outside jobs that directly related to the field they wrote about on behalf of the think tank.The three who had such outside engagements were terminated.Mr. Posen noted that the change did not imply the researchers had done anything wrong. But tighter rules are needed, he said, to respond to a growing sense he shares with the Peterson board that the think tank industry must reassert its commitment to impartiality.\u201cI live in a glass house,\u201d said Mr. Posen, a Harvard-trained economist who previously served on the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England, gesturing toward the floor-to-ceiling glass that provides him stunning views.\u201cOur reputation is built on our credibility,\u201d Mr. Posen said. \u201cWithout being perceived as credible and objective, our studies just get thrown on the scrap heap.\u201dThe Urban Institute, a Washington-based think tank that focuses on issues confronting cities, has decided to require that its scholars with any outside jobs detail the relationship in their writings.And at Brookings, executives imposed new rules in December requiring that unpaid nonresident scholars use their title from any paying job, not from Brookings, if they testify before Congress. They are also prohibited from using their affiliation with Brookings in any research report they publish under contract with an outside party.\u201cI\u2019ve moved on to other issues,\u201d Mr. Eisenach said.\u201cIt has gotten to the point where everyone in Washington has their own expert,\u201d Mr. Medvetz said. \u201cIt is yet another reflection of the tremendous influence of economic power in American politics \u2014 as with money, you can create your own vehicles of political influence.\u201dStill, not everyone is worried about the multiple roles played by think tank scholars.\u201cEveryone\u2019s got their point of view,\u201d Mr. Walden said in an interview last year. \u201cAnd some of them get paid to have that point of view.\u201dBrooke Williams is a reporter at the New England Center for Investigative Reporting, which collaborated with The New York Times on this series.

{"Headline": "In Gowanus, a People\u2019s Housing Plan to Challenge the Mayor\u2019s", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic's NotebookLast week, Mayor Bill de Blasio took an early victory lap on his campaign pledge to build and preserve 200,000 units of affordable housing by 2024. City Hall announced that nearly 53,000 affordable apartments were saved or put in the pipeline for construction during the past two and a half years.But the numbers aren\u2019t altogether rosy. A sizable chunk of those affordable apartments belong to middle-class Manhattanites in megaprojects like Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village. Another 17,400 apartments are to be built or renovated \u2014 a relative pittance considering how many hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers need subsidized housing.Another related bit of news came out of City Hall. Gowanus, a Brooklyn neighborhood on the cusp of gentrification, is joining East Harlem and six other districts the de Blasio administration will try to rezone to make room for more housing. This announcement won\u2019t surprise many residents of Gowanus, where plans for a Superfund cleanup of its notoriously polluted canal creep forward. Anticipating the rezoning, they have been putting together a redevelopment plan of their own, called Bridging Gowanus.Its goal: Take on greater density and more affordable apartments in return for improvements and guarantees that preserve the precarious soul of the district.Precarious because Gowanus\u2019s mix of light industry, artist studios, hipster shuffleboard clubs and working-class housing is under threat from the usual combination of bad development and escalating real estate prices.How will City Hall\u2019s housing plan work with Gowanus\u2019s? The truth is that Mr. de Blasio\u2019s program is about fulfilling a campaign promise \u2014 to meet an arbitrary number.Because of the depth of the city\u2019s income inequality and high costs of land and construction, most of those 200,000 affordable housing units will be unaffordable to fully half the city\u2019s population. Rents that top $3,000 a month for families making more than $125,000 a year, in areas where the median income is less than $40,000, are not exactly affordable to most New Yorkers.Two big challenges stand in the way of doing better: the decline of federal support, and baked-in skepticism among city residents that growth can be good for their neighborhoods.Since the Nixon administration, the federal government has stopped building subsidized housing. Once, public housing was a proud symbol of postwar American democracy. Hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers got good homes and a leg up. Now Washington offers tax incentives, some $7 billion a year, to private developers so they will take over the job. The public has gone from builder to beggar.For comparison\u2019s sake, Washington each year gives up more than $100 billion nationally in mortgage interest deductions, which principally benefit the upper-middle class.This year\u2019s presidential candidates \u2014 even Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton \u2014 have so far said next to nothing about affordable housing. Amazingly, neither of those Democrats had evidently visited a public-housing project before the New York primary in April. The Democrats have since strengthened the party\u2019s platform; but the issue didn\u2019t seriously come up at either convention, so it is hard to believe much help is forthcoming.City Hall knows this and plans to steer billions of capital dollars toward housing, allocating more money to subsidize affordable homes than the next 50 United States cities combined. Even so, absent greater federal money, it will remain nearly impossible to reach the levels of affordability that low-income New Yorkers actually need.Of course, housing isn\u2019t the only issue that matters to city residents. Zoning should grow out of holistic planning based on participatory governance. Communities have been complaining loudly that the de Blasio administration is a stalking horse for large developers, hellbent on securing as much housing development as it can wrangle out of rezoning negotiations with neighborhoods, conceding only what\u2019s necessary \u2014 not collaborating with locals from the start.In East New York, the first neighborhood the mayor rezoned, the city has paved the way for subsidized apartments and neighborhood improvements. But speculators have also bought property, driven up land prices and threatened some of the very residents the rezoning is intended to protect, fueling fears among poor New Yorkers that Mr. de Blasio\u2019s plan will make neighborhoods even less affordable. In some cases, the relatively high price of affordable apartments may actually drive up housing costs.Which is where a project like Bridging Gowanus, led by Brad Lander, the local city councilman, comes in. A similar grass-roots effort, the East Harlem Neighborhood Plan, has come out of that district, where Melissa Mark-Viverito, the speaker of the City Council, is the representative.The two proposals try to give communities a stronger voice in this whole messy rezoning process, upfront.They lay out priorities that neighbors have debated and rallied around \u2014 improving streets and parks; protecting lower-income residents and small businesses; addressing environmental resilience. And, of course, making sure growth comes with more and better schools, cultural programs and transit.The plans try to get ahead of rezoning efforts like those that spoiled Fourth Avenue and Williamsburg in Brooklyn during the Bloomberg years. They hark back to the 1960s, \u201970s and \u201980s, when community organizations like the Fifth Avenue Committee, Banana Kelly and the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Program helped save endangered neighborhoods, from the South Bronx to South Brooklyn.Bridging Gowanus and the East Harlem Neighborhood Plan have the advantage of backing by powerful City Council members \u2014 in neighborhoods that make developers salivate. So constructing lucrative market-rate apartments in those districts may help not just offset the costs of affordable units but also pay for public infrastructure investments.I found Ms. Mark-Viverito one recent morning powering through Thomas Jefferson Park in East Harlem, hunting for a sinkhole that an older resident had just complained to her about.\u201cI\u2019ve been realistic with our constituents about the plan,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to get 100 percent of what we want. But the reality is that a private property owner who now owns a piece of property in our neighborhood can build market-rate apartments and we can\u2019t do anything about it. So we either do this rezone and fight for it to come out as we want, or we have no leverage.\u201dMr. Lander said much the same: \u201cShaping real estate development in a capitalist economy is no easy feat. But our chance of seeing a future Gowanus based on the values we have \u2014 sustainability, livability, inclusion \u2014 get better if we try to shape that development ourselves, rather than just hope it doesn\u2019t happen.\u201dFair enough.Carl Weisbrod, director of the Department of City Planning, released a statement about Bridging Gowanus, saying he looked forward \u201cto building upon the important work undertaken by the community.\u201dHere\u2019s hoping City Hall follows through.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Poverty, Drought and Felled Trees Imperil Malawi Water Supply", "Date": "2016-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDZALANYAMA FOREST RESERVE, Malawi \u2014 Out of desperation, soldiers were dispatched to the national forest here last year to defend the capital, Lilongwe, less than 30 miles away. Their mission was not to save it from an invading force, but to keep water flowing to its taps.For years, wood charcoal burners had been destroying this forest, the catchment basin for the Lilongwe River, the source of the capital\u2019s water. Fewer trees mean the ground is less able to absorb water in the rainy season and gradually surrender it the rest of the year. With the supply reaching the capital dwindling and increasingly turbid, and with the El Ni\u00f1o drought spreading across Malawi and the rest of southern Africa, the capital was under imminent threat.\u201cWe\u2019ve always known we\u2019d have the problems we\u2019re facing now,\u201d said Alfonso Chikuni, the chief executive of the state-owned Lilongwe Water Board. After the board agreed to bear the cost of the deployment, the army ordered a company of soldiers to the Dzalanyama Forest in February 2015 to save the trees.The order came too late.Two months ago, with the water supply increasingly squeezed by the drought and rebellion in the forest, Mr. Chikuni started rationing in the capital, leaving customers bereft for half the week.The measure was a fresh blow to Lilongwe, which was already besieged by crippling power blackouts. The same combination of drought and deforestation elsewhere had undermined the nation\u2019s already strained production of hydroelectricity. Now, the capital finds itself dry or in the dark, or both, on any given day.Few places on the continent have been hit as hard by human-led environmental degradation and climate change as Malawi, a poor though politically stable nation in southeastern Africa. The effects of climate change, including shorter rainy seasons and the worst drought in decades, have pushed people into cities looking for jobs or into activities like charcoal burning. These changes have caused water shortages and power blackouts that have merely heightened the demand for ever more trees from the forest.Nearly all of the charcoal produced in Malawi is illegal. But it continues to be sold openly in the capital \u2014 some of it smuggled out of the Dzalanyama Forest despite the military\u2019s presence.\u201cWe\u2019re in a vicious cycle,\u201d said Clement Chilima, the government\u2019s director of forestry. \u201cEven myself, in my house, I have one or two bags of charcoal because you need it during the blackouts. That\u2019s me. What about somebody who is not conscious of the dangers of charcoal?\u201dCharcoal burners have led to the cutting down of trees in the national forest for years. But the scale of destruction has accelerated in the past three to five years because of the combination of drought, poverty and a growing population, Mr. Chilima said. Despite the military\u2019s presence in this forest and at least another, individuals and organized groups have continued to cut down trees to produce charcoal.When governments do respond, the unintended consequences can be grave.In the forest here, the military crackdown on charcoal has been especially hard on the poorest, among both producers and consumers, critics say. People suspected of charcoal burning have been beaten by soldiers, leading to many deaths, according to local politicians and the news media.Harold Chinkhondo, a member of the National Assembly\u2019s committee on natural resources and climate change, said beatings by soldiers had caused the deaths of more than 10 people in his constituency, Dedza West, which borders the forest. Despite promises of an investigation early this year, the military has refused to release any information, he said.\u201cWe\u2019re kept in the dark,\u201d Mr. Chinkhondo said.Capt. Paul Chiphwanya, a spokesman for the army, said that the investigation was proceeding, but that he could not say when it would be completed.Malawi is one of the poorest and most aid-dependent countries in Africa, a fact readily apparent upon landing at the capital\u2019s sleepy airport \u2014 a tiny facility even by regional standards. Planes are filled with Western missionaries, aid workers and officials with international organizations.Like other parts of the continent, Malawi has a fast-growing population and rapid urbanization. These are spurring demand for wood charcoal and firewood, which are used for cooking and heating in the cities. On a recent morning, a stream of villagers on bicycles could be seen carrying firewood from Dzalanyama Forest to the capital.Josam Sandifolo, 25, said he went to sell firewood in the capital three times a week. He paid wood cutters about $5 for his cargo and sold it to a retailer in the capital for about $8.\u201cI used to trade maize,\u201d he said, \u201cbut changed to firewood because of the drought.\u201dThe firewood on his bicycle was a typical mix of dead branches collected from the forest floor and wood that had clearly been cut recently. The freshly cut wood represented a breach of the country\u2019s forestry laws.But for now, the authorities are focusing on the bigger problem of wood charcoal, which is produced by burning freshly felled wood without oxygen in dirt kilns.In the area near where soldiers were now stationed, fields cleared of trees and dotted with the remains of kilns lay deserted next to the surviving forest.But there were 97 soldiers to guard the Dzalanyama Forest \u2014 245,000 acres, nearly 17 times the size of Manhattan \u2014 and it was clear that the charcoal burners had just moved to other production sites. Telltale white smoke from active kilns could be seen rising from many distant spots in the mountainous forest.In an interview at the military camp here, Captain Chiphwanya, the army spokesman, said soldiers had confiscated a number of trucks used to transport charcoal to the capital. While the woodcutters were locals, the transportation was organized by \u201crich people from town sending trucks to buy charcoal from the locals,\u201d he said.At night, some trucks were still engaging in the illicit trade, he said.Experts said the charcoal trade was difficult to rein in because politicians were also involved in the business.\u201cIt\u2019s not something that we are hiding,\u201d said Werani Chilenga, the chairman of the National Assembly\u2019s committee on natural resources and climate change. \u201cPoliticians are at the forefront.\u201dMr. Chilenga, who worked as a government meteorological engineer for three decades before entering politics, said the military\u2019s deployment was not a long-term solution to the charcoal problem and its effects on the country\u2019s water and power supplies.\u201cWe know what needs to be done: Government has to come up with good policies on population control, alternative energy and agriculture,\u201d he said.As the capital entered its third month of water rationing, soldiers were still guarding the forest. But for how much longer?With revenues down at the Lilongwe Water Board, its chief executive, Mr. Chikuni, said he was now uncertain how much longer he could keep paying $11,500 a month for the troop deployment.\u201cThe moment they are withdrawn,\u201d he said, \u201cI think the forest will be wiped out.\u201dRaphael Mweninguwe contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Economic Team Is Far From Typical", "Date": "2016-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookDonald Trump, laying out his economic plan on Monday in Detroit, said that the nation must \u201cstop relying on the tired voices of the past.\u201d In what would seem to be yet another jab at Hillary Clinton, he added, \u201cWe can\u2019t fix a rigged system by relying on the people who rigged it in the first place.\u201dThe group is heavy on moguls and would-be moguls \u2014 all, of course, Trump donors. Among them are Steven Roth, a real estate mogul who owns a building with Mr. Trump; Harold Hamm, the billionaire wildcatter; John A. Paulson, the billionaire hedge fund manager; Steve Feinberg, the co-founder of Cerberus, the private equity firm; and Dan DiMicco, former president and chief executive of the steel company Nucor Corporation, who has been vocal about bringing manufacturing jobs back to the United States.Wilbur Ross, the famed venture capitalist, was left off the original list but later added on Trump\u2019s website; Mr. Ross said that his team hadn\u2019t gotten back to the candidate in time to be included last week.And for those keeping score, Carl Icahn, the activist investor and longtime Trump backer, said he was left off the list so he could start a \u201csuper PAC,\u201d which he said would not be allowed if he were a formal member of the campaign.Then again, Mr. Trump has made a virtue of his lack of traditional support, depicting himself as an anti-establishment candidate willing to make difficult choices. He sent a tweet saying as much earlier this week, showing a picture of him and Ms. Clinton under the headline \u201cCampaign Contributions from Hedge Funds.\u201d It showed Ms. Clinton received $48.5 million from the hedge fund industry while Mr. Trump received only $19,000. \u201cCrooked Hillary Clinton is 100% owned by her donors,\u201d he wrote.The tweet and his economics council are a bit of mixed message, given that he is trying to raise money from the financial industry and clearly has some support \u2014 even some from traditional Republican circles. On Monday, for instance, George P. Bush, the son of Jeb (who is anti-Trump) came out in favor of the Republican candidate, urging all party members to support Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump\u2019s challenge is he is trying to be two things at the same time: distinctly anti-elite yet absolutely elite. This is particularly tough given he wants to be seen as a successful billionaire businessman while also being an outsider trying to work for the little guy.That said, while Mr. Trump may relish his unconventional group, he has been quietly trying to get some more establishment voices to join him.But many of the most prominent Republican donors have been doing their best to avoid associating with him. Stephen Schwarzman, co-founder of the Blackstone Group, met with Mr. Trump, but has so far refused to donate or publicly support him, according to people briefed on the meeting.Henry Kravis, who historically has voted for Republicans and donated money to them, has been relatively silent. (When Mr. Trump floated his name for Treasury secretary, Mr. Kravis said, \u201cThat was scary when he said that.\u201d)Ken Griffin, the founder of Citadel, would seem like a natural Trump supporter, given that he describes himself as a \u201cReagan Republican.\u201d He has donated to Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Scott Walker, but not to Mr. Trump.Cliff Asness, the billionaire founder of AQR, an investment management firm, has historically supported Republicans, but called Mr. Trump \u201ca disaster for the G.O.P. and for the country.\u201d In March, he seemed to bend a little, saying, \u201cI have to keep a more open mind,\u201d but his spokesman said on Monday that he hadn\u2019t changed his position.Paul Singer, one of the biggest Republican donors, has been part of the #NeverTrump campaign, saying his policies would be \u201ca guarantee of a global depression.\u201dThe list goes on. Seth Klarman, who runs the hedge fund Baupost, has often supported Republicans even though he is an independent. Last week he issued a blistering statement about Mr. Trump while throwing his weight behind Mrs. Clinton.\u201cHis words and actions over the last several days are so shockingly unacceptable in our diverse and democratic society that it is simply unthinkable that Donald Trump could become our president,\u201d Mr. Klarman said.Traditional Republican economists have also kept their distance. Glenn Hubbard, the dean of Columbia Business School, who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush, wrote, \u201cThe anti-trade and anti-immigration policies of Mr. Trump portend a slower-growth future for all Americans, and middle- and lower-income Americans in particular.\u201dGreg Mankiw, a Harvard economist who succeeded Mr. Hubbard as chairman of President Bush\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers and also advised Mitt Romney, said of Mr. Trump: \u201cHe will not be getting my vote. I have Republican friends who think that things couldn\u2019t be worse than doubling down on Obama policies under Hillary Clinton. And, like them, I am no fan of the left\u2019s agenda of large government and high taxes. But they are wrong: Things could be worse. And I fear they would be under Mr. Trump.\u201dMr. Ross, a Trump supporter, said he thought the candidate\u2019s economic speech in Detroit on Monday might prove to be a positive turning point. \u201cHe did a very good job,\u201d Mr. Ross said after the speech. \u201cIf he just stuck to that, he\u2019d be in a lot better shape.\u201dMr. Ross called Mr. Trump \u201csubstantive\u201d and said he was particularly impressed by \u201cthe whole way he reacted to the staged demonstrators.\u201d It was \u201cmature\u201d of Mr. Trump to refrain from taking the bait and getting angry, Mr. Ross said.The question is, if Mr. Trump adjusts his behavior over the next several weeks, will some of those establishment names come join his anti-establishment band?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Police Don\u2019t Live in the City They Serve", "Date": "2016-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMILWAUKEE \u2014 The split-second law enforcement decision of when to pull the trigger often comes down to perception. Is that person acting suspiciously? Is he or she a threat?And so much of the criticism of the police that has roiled the country over the past couple of years has centered on whether officers know the communities they patrol and understand the culture of the people who live in them.It is a question that residents have been particularly passionate about here since the Wisconsin Supreme Court in June upheld a state law that eliminated a requirement that Milwaukee police officers live in the city.Keyon Jackson-Malone, a resident of the city\u2019s predominantly black north side, said he feared that without a residency requirement, people would start coming from farther and farther away to serve as Milwaukee police officers. The metropolitan area\u2019s suburbs and exurbs are among the whitest in the country, and some have a rural feel.\u201cThere\u2019s some white people that actually only know black people by what they\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d Mr. Jackson-Malone said. \u201cThere\u2019s no experience. There\u2019s no, \u2018I went to school with 30 of them.\u2019 \u201dRather, he added: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of: \u2018I\u2019m in fear of my life. They\u2019re superhuman. They\u2019re animals. They\u2019re savage.\u2019 A person that\u2019s lived up north all their life has never had to come to the inner city, but he\u2019s going to police this kid. He don\u2019t understand about, Mama may be on drugs. He don\u2019t have no empathy for the situation.\u201dBattles over residency requirements for police officers have been fought across the country, in places as far-flung as Baton Rouge, La., and Pittsburgh. Typically, police unions are at the fore of opposition to the requirements, arguing that officers should have the freedom to choose where to live. And national tensions over policing have highlighted another argument.As it turns out, the officer involved in the shooting last week was black and lived in Milwaukee, so his residency or understanding of the community might not have been an issue. But residents said their gripes extended beyond a single episode.Anger toward the police here has built over the years in the wake of several high-profile police killings of black people.To many people here, these deaths are part of a broader culture of aggression and disrespect toward black residents in a police force that largely does not reflect the community. While black and Latino residents make up about 57 percent of the city, they are 31 percent of the police force.Johnny Winston, a longtime resident, said he felt police disrespect during a prayer march on Sunday. The march took place the day after buildings and cars went up in flames during raucous demonstrations over the killing of Mr. Smith, who the police said had disobeyed orders to drop a gun while he was chased.Mr. Winston, a deacon at the Greater New Birth Baptist church in Milwaukee, said he had marched with about 100 church members, many wearing red T-shirts with the word \u201cGrace\u201d printed in large block letters on the front and a Bible verse about \u201chealing the brokenhearted\u201d on the back. As they passed the Milwaukee District 7 police station, Mr. Winston said, they held their arms high in the air to show they were unarmed.But officers clustered near the station and on its roof greeted the marchers \u201cwith their hands on their guns,\u201d Mr. Winston said.\u201cThey jumped out of their squad cars with rifles and billy clubs,\u201d he added. \u201cWe just wanted to get our point across. We just want peace.\u201dGreg Luellen, 26, said he had had several run-ins with the law and had served time in jail. He does not so much begrudge the police for being tough on people, he said; he just wishes they would be more discerning.\u201cThey feel threatened, they\u2019re scared,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to blame them. Their job requires them to go out and deal with people they don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t knock them for what they do.\u201d But, he added, \u201cyou can\u2019t judge everybody, because everybody ain\u2019t the same.\u201dMayor Tom Barrett said that eliminating the residency requirement would only stifle efforts to make the police force more diverse and strengthen the city\u2019s economy.\u201cIt actually makes the potential for both of those problems to get worse,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have more middle-class incomes leaving the city. I\u2019m very concerned about the impact of this law on police-community relations.\u201dThe residency fight began three years ago, when the Republican-led State Legislature passed a law prohibiting cities from requiring municipal employees, including the police, to live in the cities they serve. The city continued to enforce its more than 75-year-old residency requirement, but unions for the Police and Fire Departments sued, leading to the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling.City workers had started moving out of Milwaukee while the case made its way through the courts. Currently, 364 sworn Milwaukee police officers, or about 20 percent of the force, live outside the city, according to the mayor\u2019s office.Detective Michael V. Crivello, a 25-year veteran of the force who is president of the Milwaukee Police Association, said officers spent so much time in the neighborhoods they served that they came to know them well and to understand the people there.\u201cFor our officers, it is a vocation, a calling to be a police officer,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they come to a neighborhood to police that neighborhood, that neighborhood becomes their neighborhood.\u201dAdvertisement"}

After five days in a row of being in that bedroom, it feels like you\u2019re marinating in the same juices.\u201d\u201cI was a little concerned we\u2019d get on each other\u2019s nerves,\u201d Ms. McNeely said. \u201cBut it works quite smoothly. It\u2019s about respecting each other\u2019s space.\u201dNevertheless, he recognizes that having separate offices is better for their contrasting work styles.\u201cI work in short bursts, and I\u2019ll come upstairs and bother Emma until she tells me to go away, then I\u2019ll come down and work some more,\u201d he said. \u201cEmma\u2019s a real 9-to-5-er. She\u2019ll punch in and sit there until she\u2019s done with however many pages, and she needs complete silence.\u201dThere can be interpersonal benefits to sharing an office, too. Ms. Hustad said that the extra time with her husband had accelerated their intimacy. \u201cWe know each other better and our quirks and eccentricities,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve mostly been on our own, so we each had our way of doing things. We had to get over our selfishness really quickly.\u201dMs. McNeely said: \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t have a clue what their partner does on a daily basis. Maybe they\u2019ve never even been to their office. You can have big problems in a relationship when you lead a separate life your partner isn\u2019t aware of.\u201dThe absence of co-workers or a boss, though, can also transform a partner into something of a supervisor.\u201cIf one of us is exhausted and needs a nap, you feel like you owe an explanation,\u201d said Ms. McNeely, who has an infant. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same as reporting to a boss, but there\u2019s a certain accountability or incentive to work harder.\u201dMr. Greenberg and Ms. Degyansky have even adopted an oversight strategy out of the corporate playbook.\u201cWe have \u2018goals meeting\u2019 at 8:30 every morning,\u201d Mr. Greenberg said. \u201cWe write down the things we want to accomplish that day and tell them to each other. The process of saying, \u2018I\u2019m doing laundry today\u2019 to someone else keeps you accountable.\u201dThe announcement of goals (frequently more elevated than laundry) is as much a warning of unavailability to the partner as motivation, he pointed out.\u201cWe started doing this on vacation, when we were in the same space every day for a month,\u201d he said. \u201cWe realized that when we didn\u2019t talk about our artistic goals, there\u2019s this assumption that the other person is free to hang out anytime if you don\u2019t have a regular job.\u201dTeamwork and brainstorming, especially for couples in similar fields, is another boon.Mr. Greenberg and Ms. Degyansky talk through their work problems, usually on walks. He said these strolls are a necessity \u2014 not merely to get out of the house, but also to schedule quality time together.\u201cOften we\u2019ll spend a whole day together, but it doesn\u2019t feel like we\u2019ve spent any time together, because we were in the same room but working on separate things,\u201d he said, relaying a mise-en-sc\u00e8ne familiar to any screen-mediated couple.Mr. Fusco-Straub seconded the importance of shared activities outside the home.\u201cWe spend so much time together that it almost seems absurd, but it\u2019s important,\u201d he said. The couple has two children, including a newborn, but before that, he said, \u201cwe tried to have a scheduled night, because it is a different feeling going out for dinner rather than sitting in the house watching a million episodes of \u2018Transparent.\u2019\u201dAnd all of those hours logged together typically make a work-at-home partner more comfortable requesting alone time than the average cubicle-mate who is afraid of offending a chatty co-worker.\u201cWhen Emma\u2019s deep in a book, and I get restless and come up and bother her,\u201d Mr. Fusco-Straub said, his wife will tell him, \u201cO.K., you\u2019ve got to go now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

A man who decides to explore the sexual and emotional makeup of three generations of women must, at every turn, check his privilege, avert his \u201cmale gaze\u201d and for the love of God, no \u201cmansplaining.\u201d In his new novel, \u201cThe Inseparables,\u201d Stuart Nadler has successfully braved this potential minefield in order to bring us the wonderfully authentic Olyphant women.In the 1960s, Henrietta Olyphant gave lectures on female sexuality, social shame and the \u201cgendered economy of housework.\u201d She might have imagined that women would someday enjoy sex on a more equal standing with men \u2014 unfettered by the shackles of domesticity and free of society\u2019s disapproving glare. Unfortunately, decades later, Henrietta, her daughter and granddaughter are each descending into a weeklong sexual shame spiral.Henrietta is dreading the coming reissue of her novel, \u201cThe Inseparables.\u201d Originally published in the 1970s, the X-rated best seller includes Henrietta\u2019s own comic illustrations of vaginas, penises and outlandish sexual predicaments. It was meant to poke fun at traditional views on marriage and fidelity. Instead, it was savaged by critics and feminists, and adored by the very people she had meant to mock \u2014 doting housewives and lusty, leering men. Henrietta needs the money from the book\u2019s new edition; her beloved but careless husband, Harold, died almost a year ago, leaving her with significant debt. Still, Henrietta wishes she had never written the book she has always called \u201cthat thing.\u201dHenrietta\u2019s daughter, Oona, a busy orthopedic surgeon, has left her slacker husband, Spencer, and moved back in with her mother. She and Spencer saw a marriage counselor before they separated. Now Oona is really seeing the marriage counselor \u2014 they have begun to date. And to complete the family dysfunction trifecta, Oona\u2019s 15-year-old daughter, Lydia, has just been suspended from boarding school for allegedly sending a photo of her bare breasts to a male classmate, who then shared it with the entire school.There is much to enjoy about this book. I laughed out loud at scenes like the one in which the estranged Spencer joins the Olyphant women for dinner, unaware that his former therapist is hiding in the attic. But the most memorable moments examine the intricacies of familial love \u2014 the bonds between mothers and daughters, men and women, boys and girls. Henrietta\u2019s memories of Harold\u2019s professional rise and fall are particularly poignant. Like Henrietta, Harold had a fleeting moment of fame. His restaurant, the Feast, was once one of Boston\u2019s most popular and critically acclaimed dining establishments. Eventually it became a \u201cmuseum of butter,\u201d with its rich, French-inspired menu that had gone out of vogue. Harold refused to adapt to changing dietary trends, and Henrietta tried to protect her husband from despair during the restaurant\u2019s slow and painful decline. Her quiet devotion to Harold is beautifully paralleled in a chapter about Harold\u2019s solemn love for the animals that were sacrificed for his rich stocks and stews.\u201cHis meat, he said once, was like the color a painter had to extract from a berry that grew only on one bush, and bloomed for only one week. .\u2008.\u2008. He cooked slowly. He watched through the kitchen doors as people ate. He wanted to see the satisfaction. Wash their dish. Send them home happy.\u201dOne can\u2019t help drawing a parallel to \u00adNadler\u2019s writing as well: carefully \u00adrendered, unpretentious and always with the reader\u2019s satisfaction on the front burner.Ann Leary\u2019s new novel, \u201cThe Children,\u201d was published in May.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed, Eager to Show It\u2019s Listening, Welcomes Protesters", "Date": "2016-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When a dozen protesters in green T-shirts showed up two years ago at the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., they were regarded by many participants as an amusing addition.Two years later, they have won a place on the schedule.The protesters, who want the Fed to extend its economic stimulus campaign, are scheduled to meet on Thursday with eight members of the central bank\u2019s policy-making committee. At the start of a conference devoted to esoteric debates about monetary policy, officials will hear from people struggling to make ends meet.The Fed\u2019s effort to show that it is listening to its critics reflects the central bank\u2019s broader struggle to find its footing in an era whose great challenge is not the strength of inflation, but the weakness of economic growth.\u201cWe want to make sure that regular voices are being heard,\u201d Mr. Barkan said in beginning the campaign two years ago. The American economy, he said, was not working for all Americans \u2014 particularly not for blacks and other minority groups.Fed officials so far have chosen to accommodate the group by applauding its efforts at public education, not by seriously engaging its arguments that interest rates should be raised more slowly. Esther George, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, which hosts the Jackson Hole conference, arranged Thursday\u2019s meeting with the activists. She said in an interview earlier this year that the Fed must balance job growth with other issues, like financial stability.\u201cI am completely sympathetic,\u201d she said of the group\u2019s concerns.But she cautioned that the Fed\u2019s powers were limited. Pushing too hard to lower unemployment could lead to higher inflation, or speculative bubbles, that would force the Fed to raise interest rates more quickly. The resulting economic volatility could end up doing more harm than good.\u201cThe Federal Reserve has become somehow the answer to many problems far beyond what we can actually address,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish I could fix all of it with a tool like monetary policy. But we can\u2019t.\u201dFed Up\u2019s more visible success has come in pursuit of a longer-term goal: advocating for changes in the Fed\u2019s governance that could eventually shift its decision-making.Moreover, the report said that whites composed 83 percent of the directors of the Fed\u2019s 12 regional reserve banks, who select the regional presidents.Narayana Kocherlakota, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said that the absence of minorities was \u201cquite troubling.\u201d\u201cThose kinds of persistent absences of key demographic groups really suggest that the appointment process, there is something that can be fixed there,\u201d he said.Fed Up also argued that bank executives should not sit on regional Fed boards. Under current law, bankers hold three of the nine seats on each board. The regional reserve banks are owned by the commercial banks in each district, although they operate under the authority of the Fed\u2019s board, a government agency whose members are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.On the same day, a spokesman for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign said in a statement that \u201cSecretary Clinton believes that the Fed needs to be more representative of America as a whole and that common sense reforms \u2014 like getting bankers off the boards of regional Federal Reserve Banks \u2014 are long overdue.\u201dTwo months later, the Democratic Party adopted a campaign platform that included similar language, the first time in recent decades it mentioned the Fed.\u201cHaving a diverse set of policy makers \u2014 including African-Americans and Hispanics \u2014 will influence the Fed\u2019s decision-making,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it should. The public should have confidence that the public is well represented at the F.O.M.C. table.\u201d\u201cEven if they move once less over the course of several years, that\u2019s still massive,\u201d he said earlier this year. \u201cThe number of people who have jobs because of that, or higher wages, that dwarves a $15-an-hour wage increase in a smaller city.\u201dLael Brainard, a Fed governor who plans to attend the Thursday meeting, made a point last year of visiting the parallel conference Mr. Barkan staged on the sidelines of the Fed event. And Mr. Barkan\u2019s group has now succeeded in persuading each of the regional reserve presidents to meet with groups of local workers.Neel Kashkari, the new president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, met with Fed Up\u2019s local affiliate, Neighborhoods Organizing for Change, this month, telling the group that he shared their concern about the persistence of higher rates of unemployment among blacks and other minority groups.Mr. Kashkari also accepted an invitation to spend a day with one of the group\u2019s members, Rosheeda Credit, a Minneapolis resident who described the struggles she and her boyfriend faced to cover the cost of rent and child care for their five children.\u201cWalking a day in somebody else\u2019s shoes is actually \u2014 it makes the anecdotes that much more real,\u201d Mr. Kashkari, who arrived at the bank in January, told reporters after the meeting. \u201cIt influences how I think about the problems we face.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Putin, Disinformation Is Power", "Date": "2016-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMOSCOW \u2014 Fifteen years ago, a few months into his presidency, Vladimir V. Putin told Larry King on CNN that his previous job as a K.G.B. officer had been like that of a journalist. \u201cThey have the same purpose of gathering information, synthesizing it and presenting it for the consumption of decision makers,\u201d he said. Since then, he has excelled at using the media to consolidate power inside Russia and, increasingly, to wage an information war against the West.So the apparent hacking by Russian security services of the Democratic National Committee emails, followed by their publication by WikiLeaks, should come as no great surprise to Americans. It is only the latest example of how Mr. Putin uses information as a weapon. And the Kremlin has cultivated ties with WikiLeaks for years.It has also used disinformation in its annexation of Crimea and in its war in Ukraine, launched cyberattacks on Finland and the Baltic States, and planted hoax stories in Germany to embarrass Angela Merkel. During the Cold War, the Kremlin interfered in American politics for decades. The K.G.B.\u2019s so-called active measures \u2014 subversion, media manipulations, forgery and the financing of some \u201cpeace\u201d organizations \u2014 lay at the heart of Soviet intelligence.Then as now, Russia exploited real grievances in the West \u2014 discontent with the war in Vietnam and racial tensions in the 1960s; anxiety and fear of Muslim immigrants today. Nevertheless, Mr. Putin\u2019s support of the likes of Donald Trump in America, Brexiters in Britain or the right-wing Marine Le Pen in France does not mean they are his creations.What seems to puzzle the American public most is why Russia, having shed Communism, is working to undermine the West today. Didn\u2019t America win the Cold War?Actually, that question, which arose 15 years ago, is as alive today as it was then. While most Americans saw the end of the Cold War as a triumph over the Soviet Union, most Russians saw it as a victory of their own common sense over a senile and inept regime that had run out of money and ideas and had lost its appetite for repression. After Mikhail Gorbachev opened up the Soviet media, the contrast between socialist and capitalist economic systems had become too apparent. And when the K.G.B. attempted a coup against Mr. Gorbachev in 1991, not a single person came out on the street to defend Communism, while thousands risked their lives protesting the coup in Moscow, in defense of freedom.Then came an American mistake: triumphalism, rather than congratulating the Russian people on their victory over authoritarian rule, and using a short window of opportunity to offer Russia sufficient economic aid to ease the pain of a collapsing economy. This was shortsighted and dangerous. It created a false sense of invincibility in America and paved the way for resentment in Russia. Eventually, it let revisionists like Mr. Putin portray the collapse of the Soviet Union as an American conspiracy.Over the past decade, this narrative of defeat and humiliation has become a stalwart of Mr. Putin\u2019s ideology of resurgence. If America won the Cold War, it must be responsible for the Soviet breakup and the impoverishment of millions of Russians. And if Russia was defeated, it could only be expected to one day seek revenge.This narrative has become extremely popular in Russia. Anti-Americanism offers Russians a familiar outlet for their frustration and sense of impotence in the face of their own corrupt and oppressive regime. It gives Mr. Putin an ideological cover for his kleptocratic system of governance led by current and former security servicemen. To sustain this narrative, the Kremlin\u2019s state-controlled media has excelled at reconstructing the centuries-old image of Russia as a besieged fortress.Today, Mr. Putin presents Russia\u2019s actions as responsive, not aggressive. Every time Russia attacks a former Soviet republic, the confrontation is portrayed as a proxy war started by America against Russia. When Russia attacked Georgia in 2008, the United States was in the midst of a presidential election that the incumbent Republican Party would soon lose, so the war was followed the next year not by tough sanctions against Russia but with a \u201creset\u201d initiated by the new Democratic president, Barack Obama, and his secretary of state, Hillary Clinton.That, too, proved a misstep. The idea was that two new presidents \u2014 Mr. Obama and Dmitri A. Medvedev, who had recently taken Mr. Putin\u2019s place in the Kremlin \u2014 could put the past behind them. But Mr. Medvedev, who oversaw the war in Georgia, was only a place-holder appointed by Mr. Putin to circumvent a constitutional term limit. Policy makers in Washington and in Berlin knew this but decided to build up Mr. Medvedev, hoping to split Russia\u2019s elites. Instead, Russia got away with the Georgia war cost-free, which ultimately contributed to Russian confidence that its later incursions into Ukraine would succeed.Mr. Medvedev\u2019s presidency ended with mass demonstrations in Moscow and other cities in the winter of 2011-12, with tens of thousands protesting Mr. Putin\u2019s return to the presidency and demanding modernization of the state. At the time, Mr. Putin accused Mrs. Clinton of taking \u201cactive measures\u201d to spur protesters on. \u201cShe set the tone for some actors in our country and gave them a signal,\u201d he said. \u201cThey heard the signal and with the support of the U.S. State Department began active work.\u201dNow Mr. Putin, who is known to bear grudges, appears to be disrupting Mrs. Clinton\u2019s own presidential campaign with \u201cactive measures.\u201d That the disclosures of the Democratic National Committee emails could benefit only Donald Trump is probably an added bonus. Mr. Trump\u2019s main appeal within the Kremlin is not that he admires Mr. Putin, but that he has little interest in Russia\u2019s sphere of influence. And Mr. Putin has long dreamed of a new Yalta-style agreement to let Russia and America divide Europe again.To be sure, Russia\u2019s ability to influence American elections is limited. Mr. Putin does not control the American media, and Russia lacks the financial and military resources that the Soviet Union had. Still, the effort points to a danger. An angry and declining Russia is far more perilous than an ascending economic power like China. Sanctions won\u2019t change Mr. Putin\u2019s behavior: He rates the security of his regime far above the economic good of the country.Mr. Putin has reason to fear in one respect. His system does face an existential threat from the Western model of governance. Just as the economic inadequacies of Soviet Communism were exposed by comparison with the wealth produced by Western capitalism, Mr. Putin\u2019s authoritarianism cannot match the appeal of an economy based on the rule of law, openness and competition. The best way for the West to resist Russia, now as then, is to uphold its own values.\u201cRussia, as opposed to the Western world in general, is still by far the weaker party and may well contain deficiencies which will eventually weaken its own total potential.\u201d So wrote the master diplomat George F. Kennan in 1947. We know now that Kennan was right. The bad news is that it took 44 years for his prophecy to come true.Arkady Ostrovsky, the Russia and Eastern Europe editor at The Economist, is the author of \u201cThe Invention of Russia: From Gorbachev\u2019s Freedom to Putin\u2019s War.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Misery of the Mini-Trumps", "Date": "2016-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn his race against Marco Rubio to become the Republican nominee for one of Florida\u2019s two seats in the Senate, the rich, brash homebuilder Carlos Beruff could not be welding himself more tightly to Donald Trump.His tweets are Trumpian, including this proclamation: \u201cI won\u2019t read a bunch of political crap off a teleprompter.\u201d The Miami New Times crowned him \u201cthe Cuban-American Donald Trump.\u201d \u201cLittle Trump of Florida,\u201d said the publication Roll Call.So how\u2019s that working out for Beruff?Not so well.And that\u2019s not because Florida Republicans are Rubio stalwarts. In the state\u2019s presidential primary last March, Trump trounced him by almost 20 points.But it turns out that Trump\u2019s magic, if you can call it that, resists cloning. It\u2019s not easily transferable, either. Unlike other political supernovas, Trump doesn\u2019t have coattails or for that matter a coat \u2014 not even a windbreaker.And that casts serious doubt on the existence of Trumpism minus Trump.Has he created anything along the lines of the movement that he sometimes brags about? Has he assembled a coalition of voters that will outlast his candidacy and can deliver victory to a candidate who emulates him but lacks the reality-show stardom, the glittering towers, the garish tresses?Beruff\u2019s situation suggests not, and so do the sorry fates of other Republican candidates who channeled Trump or genuflected before him \u2014 including, most prominently, Paul Nehlen, whose early August primary face-off with Paul Ryan in Wisconsin drew national attention.Part of Nehlen\u2019s case against Ryan was that he\u2019d \u201cshown more passion in attacking Trump than he has ever shown in defending Americans,\u201d according to one statement that his campaign released.Trump lavished Twitter love on Nehlen before party leaders shamed him into grudgingly endorsing Ryan. Prominent Trump surrogates, including Sarah Palin and Ann Coulter, beat the drums for Nehlen. Coulter visited Wisconsin to stump for him, telling voters: \u201cThis is it. This is your last chance to save America.\u201dAmerica was not saved. Voters chose Ryan over Nehlen by nearly 70 points.Without doubt, Trump has exposed fissures in \u2014 and the fragility of \u2014 the Republican base. He has tapped into a potent, pervasive anger among American voters, and some of the positions that he\u2019s staked out are much, much more popular than was previously understood.Bernie Sanders\u2019s surprisingly strong showing against Hillary Clinton helped to prove that. While Sanders didn\u2019t share Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant rants or racist appeals, he, too, questioned America\u2019s open trade practices, the scope of its military interventions, the power of money in elections, and the degree to which the economy was stacked in favor of corporate interests and entrenched elites.That complaint will survive Trump, no matter how his candidacy ultimately fares, and both the Republican and Democratic parties will be forced to grapple with it seriously going forward.But wrapping it in a package of florid bigotry, provocative propositions, crude insults and callous language doesn\u2019t seem to have much traction beyond Trump.And not one of those ideas \u2014 his extreme brand of protectionism, his call to re-examine military alliances, his threat of mass deportations \u2014 shows any sign of becoming Republican dogma the way that supply-side economics did in the wake of Ronald Reagan\u2019s evangelism for it. There\u2019s less evidence of Republicans\u2019 moving en masse toward Trump\u2019s platform than of Trump himself retreating from it, as he did on immigration last week.As for the mini-Trumps, they\u2019ve known nothing but misery. Consider Kentucky\u2019s Mike Pape, who set his sights on a congressional seat.

{"Headline": "America Is Safer Than It Used to Be. So Why Do We Still Have Calls for \u2018Law and Order\u2019?", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst WordsBy its own historical standards, America circa 2016 is a safe place. The country\u2019s violent crime rate is about half of what it was in 1991. Cities, in particular, have become markedly less dangerous. Less than half as many police officers are killed in the line of duty today as in the mid-1970s. In 1968, Americans rated \u201ccrime and lawlessness\u201d as the single most important domestic problem facing the nation. Today, according to Gallup, they rank \u201ccrime/violence\u201d below issues like the economy, unemployment, racism and race relations, and dissatisfaction with government.This would seem to be news to Donald Trump, who, speaking to voters in Michigan in August, offered a vision of a \u201cnew American future\u201d in which \u201claw and order will be restored.\u201d The language echoed his convention speech, in which Trump used the phrase \u201claw and order\u201d not once, not twice but four times. After painting a bleak picture of American cities overrun by marauding gangs and murderous illegal immigrants, he vowed: \u201cWhen I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order to our country.\u201dWe all understand, more or less, what Trump is getting at. In American politics, \u201claw and order\u201d is lock-em-up language, tough talk that is used to vilify far more than crime and criminals. It also tends to encompass the supposed disorder created by poor people, African-Americans, street protesters and immigrants. During the 1960s, Richard Nixon and other conservatives famously used the phrase to present \u201ca comprehensive critique of liberalism\u2019s failure,\u201d in the words of the historian Michael Flamm. Like \u201cthe silent majority,\u201d another Nixonian throwback that Trump recycles from time to time, \u201claw and order\u201d conveyed which side you were on in the political and cultural wars of that era.But there are some big differences between then and now. In the 1960s, the United States experienced rising murder rates, devastating urban riots and the assassinations of some of the era\u2019s most prominent public figures. By contrast, despite this summer\u2019s episodes of acute violence and unrest \u2014 the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando in June, Micah Johnson\u2019s deadly assault on police in Dallas in July, the rioting and protests that followed a shooting by a police officer in Milwaukee in August \u2014 American society now looks almost pacific. In this context, Trump\u2019s reheated language raises the question of why the Nixonian vision of a collapsing nation in need of \u201claw and order\u201d still has such political currency, and why, of all the shifting connotations the phrase has carried in American history, this is the one we still cling to.The 1920 election produced the nation\u2019s first modern \u201claw and order\u201d presidential candidate in the form of the Massachusetts governor, Calvin Coolidge. Making a long-shot bid for the Republican nomination, Coolidge ran on his opposition to the Boston Police strike, a position that made him \u201cthe protagonist of the cause of the supremacy of law and order,\u201d in the words of the former president William Howard Taft. At the Republican convention, Representative Frederick H. Gillett entered Coolidge\u2019s name into contention with the decidedly Trumpian promise to \u201creinvigorate the homely, orderly virtues which have made America great.\u201d Though Coolidge lost that bid (he joined the ticket as Warren Harding\u2019s vice-presidential candidate), his campaign offered a glimpse of a future in which \u201claw and order\u201d would be about suppressing social rebellion as well as controlling crime.Thanks partly to Coolidge\u2019s inspiration, the 1920s unfolded as the nation\u2019s first \u201claw and order\u201d decade. \u201cPopular demand is being heard everywhere for candidates pledged to this paramount issue,\u201d The Christian Science Monitor noted in 1922. Behind this embrace of the term were some of the same worries that would resurface in the 1960s, including a perception of sharply rising crime. Far from bringing a triumph of \u201claw and order\u201d as the temperance movement had hoped, Prohibition helped create a major crime wave, as organized syndicates grew fat on bootlegging and smuggling and gained footholds in major cities.When Franklin Roosevelt entered the White House in 1933, he oversaw the repeal of Prohibition and called for a \u201cwar on crime\u201d to wipe the slate clean. \u201cI want the backing of every man, every woman and every adolescent child in every state of the United States and in every county of every state; their backing for what you and the officers of law and order are trying to accomplish,\u201d he declared to attendees at a crime conference in 1934.Even then, however, other understandings of \u201claw and order\u201d persisted. As late as 1963, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. invoked the phrase to argue on behalf of federal intervention against the Ku Klux Klan, echoing the arguments of the anti-lynching movement. He also insisted that nonviolent civil disobedience, far from violating law and order, could actually help maintain social peace. \u201cLaw and order,\u201d he wrote, \u201cexist for the purpose of establishing justice, and ... when they fail to do this they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress.\u201dConservatives of the 1960s took direct aim at this linkage of justice and order. \u201cJustice is merely incidental to law and order,\u201d J. Edgar Hoover, the F.B.I. director, told CBS News in 1968. \u201cLaw and order is what covers the whole picture.\u201d Among presidential candidates, Barry Goldwater tried to bring \u201claw and order\u201d firmly into the Republican camp, but he lost badly to Lyndon Johnson, who offered his own vision of a \u201cwar on crime\u201d as well as a \u201cwar on poverty.\u201d It took Nixon\u2019s 1968 campaign to establish Republican ownership of the \u201clawnorder issue,\u201d as one reporter described it in an apparent nod to Nixon\u2019s white suburban voters.To a degree, Nixon simply benefited from the course of events. Between 1965 and 1968, the United States underwent an astonishing string of violent upheavals: deadly riots in Watts, Newark and Detroit; the assassinations of Malcolm X, King and Robert Kennedy; and the brutal police crackdown on demonstrators at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. All of this occurred in the context of rising murder rates and increasingly heated attacks on law enforcement \u201cpigs.\u201d When Nixon declared in 1968 that he would \u201crestore order and respect for law in this country,\u201d millions of Americans were primed to listen.Trump\u2019s own \u201claw and order\u201d speechifying often seems to have been ripped directly out of these earlier eras, summoning timeworn racial stereotypes and specters of an acute urban crisis that no longer quite exists. But this anachronism serves its own purpose, as a form of nostalgia politics. \u201cLaw and order\u201d may no longer reflect a pressing social reality, but it does evoke a time when national politicians spoke openly of the need to push back against urban insurgencies, liberal social policies and racial unrest. In using the phrase, Trump is hinting at his contempt for the Black Lives Matter and gun-control movements, which have staked their own claims about the urgent need to combat violence.Like King, those movements offer a competing vision of \u201claw and order\u201d in which law enforcement and social justice go hand in hand. It\u2019s this vision that seems more of the moment in 2016, as politicians in both parties voice concerns over militarized police and overincarceration. Trump\u2019s \u201claw and order,\u201d by contrast, may have already seen its best political days. For Nixon, invoking the phrase was an expansionary political strategy, a way for the Republican Party to reach traditionally Democratic white voters, especially in the urban North. For Trump, it is just another way of preaching to the converted.Beverly Gage is a history professor at Yale. She is writing a biography of J. Edgar Hoover.Advertisement"}

The Bernie Sanders campaign suggests that rebuilding fairness could be more important than continual economic growth.Maybe we are striving for the wrong end.GWEN HANSONBellevue, Wash.To the Editor:The Upshot reports on some theories by prominent economists on why \u201ceconomic growth in advanced nations has been weaker for longer than it has been in the lifetime of most people on earth.\u201dOne thought from some of us in the for-profit sector is the unprecedented explosion of regulations that have forced businesses large and small to devote a lot of resources to compliance efforts. The inputs \u2014 direct labor, meetings, reviews and paperwork \u2014 are enormous. But the outcomes are essentially zero.But perhaps the biggest issue involves defining the original problem. Why confine the study to \u201cadvanced nations\u201d? Looking at population-weighted growth, the economic activity of the world is right on track.

GESSNERMarblehead, Mass.To the Editor:The explanation for America\u2019s slow growth is quite simple. In a capitalistic system, maximizing profits is the overarching concern. Since the population is increasing, as is automation, corporations maximize profits by lowering wages as much as possible and getting by with as few workers as possible. Workers have become fungible.Wage stagnation is a major problem in the United States; hence, disposable income has decreased for most folks in America. That means that demand for goods and services has decreased, resulting in the need for even fewer workers.The Fed has provided almost free money hoping that corporations would borrow at low rates and expand, invest in new plants and equipment, and hire new workers. Instead, corporations have used borrowed money to buy back stock, to buy other companies, and to pay executives huge bonuses and stock options.Only a relatively low number of people at the top have benefited. Thus, we have fewer people at the top supporting an increasing number of poor people at the bottom. This is unsustainable.These forces have led to the rise of Donald Trump and his followers.

{"Headline": "The U.N.\u2019s Cholera Admission and What Comes Next", "Date": "2016-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNotebookIt may not seem like much from the outside, but in the context of those different but deeply linked places \u2014 the often-disrespected Caribbean nation and the U.N. headquarters on the East River in Midtown Manhattan that has controlled so much of Haiti\u2019s recent history \u2014 the words were a tectonic shift.Scientists and researchers have repeatedly found, with overwhelming consensus, that U.N. peacekeepers introduced the disease to Haiti for the first time ever recorded by knowingly allowing their infected feces to slough into the Meille River, which locals used for drinking, bathing and washing \u2014 in violation of the U.N\u2019s own protocols and the most basic tenets of public health.In that light, it was also a victory for one of the less-publicized players in this case: the United States government. Because the U.N. has refused to accept the legitimacy of the federal case, Justice Department lawyers have defended the organization instead in court. Judge Jos\u00e9 A. Cabranes cited the Obama administration\u2019s U.N.-friendly interpretation of the immunities convention as a significant factor in the three-judge panel\u2019s decision. Lawyers for the plaintiffs are still deciding whether to appeal to the Supreme Court.I have heard for years from high-level United Nations officials that American resistance has played a major role in keeping the organization from coming clean about what happened in Haiti and settling with victims. There are a few reasons the Obama administration would do that. The president has frequently defended the United Nations, which on its better days represents the multilateral, diplomatic approach central to his foreign policy worldview \u2014 in contrast to the philosophies of George W. Bush or Donald Trump. Any U.S. president would also want to uphold the principle that troops operating on foreign soil can\u2019t be hauled into local courts, whether they\u2019re blue-helmeted Nepalese peacekeepers in Haiti or American soldiers in Afghanistan.There\u2019s also a financial angle. Any restitution will ultimately have to come from member states. None is more invested than the United States, which supplies more than a quarter of the United Nations peacekeeping budget, an expenditure that Washington, perennial congressional grumbling notwithstanding, has generally considered well spent: It allows the United States to outsource many overseas military missions it would otherwise feel pressure to undertake itself. The Bush administration led the way in creating the U.N. Stabilization Mission in Haiti, or Minustah, putting together a blue-helmeted force to replace U.S. soldiers and Marines whom Bush sent to Haiti after a 2004 coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. If there is one thing the Obama administration and Republicans in Congress can agree on, it\u2019s that neither wants to pay the United Nations more than it is already obligated to.A U.N. adviser criticizes the organization for its \"morally unconscionable, legally indefensible, and politically self-defeating\" response to the epidemic.This has been going on from the beginning of the crisis. In October 2010, when reports of unusual deaths in the countryside reached Haiti\u2019s capital, Port-au-Prince, rumors spread through Haiti that a U.N. peacekeeping base that was home to Nepalese soldiers was responsible. But instead of calling for a thorough investigation, Minustah denounced the rumors as spurious. A spokesman then sent out a news release making false claims about the quality of sanitation at the base.The U.N. knew its soldiers from Nepal had just arrived from a country with an active cholera outbreak, and knew they had not been screened for the disease. But Minustah officials spent months trying to convince journalists that the accusations about the base were false or too dangerous to investigate, or both. They were assisted by allies at the World Health Organization and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who repeatedly told the public that finding the source of the epidemic was \u201cnot productive\u201d and \u201cnot important\u201d while declining to conduct investigations of their own. As deaths continued, young Haitians took to the streets, setting up flaming barricades and throwing rocks at U.N. soldiers, who fired back. Several protesters died.U.N. officials have spent the six years since then avoiding the issue by using evasive language and ignoring the findings of their own appointed scientists, who indicated that negligent sanitation at the organization\u2019s base introduced the South Asian strain of cholera into Haiti. Sometimes they have encouraged the incorrect perception that the outbreak was somehow a result of the magnitude-7.0 earthquake that struck a different part of the country more than nine months before the first cases appeared and was barely felt in the area where the cholera outbreak began. In other cases, Alston noted in his report, U.N. officials have changed the topic by accusing those asking about the organization\u2019s responsibility of playing \u201cthe blame game\u201d \u2014 while themselves shifting blame to the wider inadequacy of sanitation practices in Haiti or insisting that the whole matter be dropped because of \u201cthe need to move beyond the past.\u201dThese talking points are familiar to anyone who has reported on the cholera epidemic. In April, I interviewed Atul Khare, the under secretary general who oversees all United Nations field missions worldwide and who stressed to me the organization\u2019s belief in accountability and environmental stewardship around the world. When I asked whether this meant there should be consequences for the United Nations after the outbreak, he hastened to clarify: \u201cI am talking about future actions. I cannot go back and change the past. That is impossible.\u201dThe United Nations has also pointed to its efforts to eradicate the disease in Haiti in the context of its other development projects there. In June, Jan Eliasson, the deputy secretary general, assured me via email that the organization was honoring its \u201cfundamental responsibility to the Haitian people and to the Haitian nation \u2026 to improve education, housing and health care, as well as programs aimed at securing sanitation and clean water.\u201dAlston blasted that logic in his report, noting that for all its talk, the United Nations has raised just 18 percent of the funds needed for even a relatively modest $2.2 billion cholera eradication program in Haiti. There have been some vaccination programs and emergency assistance, but no significant water or sanitation systems \u2014 the things that have kept cholera from ravaging wealthy countries since the late 19th century \u2014 have been built. \u201cThe United Nations consistently calls upon states to acknowledge wrongdoing, to ensure meaningful processes for the vindication of claims and to provide victims with redress,\u201d Alston wrote. \u201cYet in the Haiti case, the victims are told that a handful of broadly focused development projects should provide sufficient redress.\u201d He later added: \u201cProject-based initiatives should not be seen as a substitute for personal compensation.\u201dAnd yet even as the United Nations refused to accept the legitimacy of the lawsuit against it, Ban and other U.N. officials have used the legal action as a pretext not to answer questions about the epidemic.So, keeping all that in mind, for a vast international bureaucracy where any stray word in any one of its five official languages could represent the difference between war and peace, those two words \u2014 \u201cown involvement\u201d \u2014 are monumental. They are, my contacts inside the organization tell me, the product of years of battles between forces fighting to protect the organization from all liability on one hand and others who believe it is the U.N.\u2019s mission to fight for human rights, even behind the glass facade of its New York headquarters.The question is whether, absent a court or some other outside power, the United Nations and its members \u2014 particularly the United States \u2014 will choose on their own to spend the money and put in the effort to make things right again. So far they haven\u2019t. The stonewalling has destroyed what was left of the United Nations\u2019 reputation in Haiti, and has done the organization few favors in the rest of the world. Meanwhile, people in Haiti continue to die from cholera, infection rates continue to rise, and the damage to the country\u2019s economy, social structures and reputation goes unrepaired.In the report\u2019s final line, Alston called specifically on the United States government to \u201cactively support a resolution to this ongoing crisis that respects the rights of the victims of this tragedy and best serves the reputational and other interests of the United Nations.\u201dThat those actions will be presented only after being agreed to with the Haitian authorities could delay matters further: Haiti doesn\u2019t currently have an elected president, because of delays in a shambolic, unfinished election largely funded, so far, by the United States.But there is another deadline approaching too. This September, presidents, prime ministers and monarchs from nearly every nation will converge on the U.N. for the opening of the General Assembly \u2014 the U.N.\u2019s biggest annual event, and the last of Ban\u2019s decade-long tenure as secretary-general.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Once Skeptical of Executive Power, Obama Has Come to Embrace It", "Date": "2016-08-13", "News": "Mr. Obama will leave the White House as one of the most prolific authors of major regulations in presidential history.Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In nearly eight years in office, President Obama has sought to reshape the nation with a sweeping assertion of executive authority and a canon of regulations that have inserted the United States government more deeply into American life.Once a presidential candidate with deep misgivings about executive power, Mr. Obama will leave the White House as one of the most prolific authors of major regulations in presidential history.Blocked for most of his presidency by Congress, Mr. Obama has sought to act however he could. In the process he created the kind of government neither he nor the Republicans wanted \u2014 one that depended on bureaucratic bulldozing rather than legislative transparency. But once Mr. Obama got the taste for it, he pursued his executive power without apology, and in ways that will shape the presidency for decades to come.The Obama administration in its first seven years finalized 560 major regulations \u2014 those classified by the Congressional Budget Office as having particularly significant economic or social impacts. That was nearly 50 percent more than the George W. Bush administration during the comparable period, according to data kept by the regulatory studies center at George Washington University.An army of lawyers working under Mr. Obama\u2019s authority has sought to restructure the nation\u2019s health care and financial industries, limit pollution, bolster workplace protections and extend equal rights to minorities. Under Mr. Obama, the government has literally placed a higher value on human life.And it has imposed billions of dollars in new costs on businesses and consumers.Many of the new rules are little known, even as they affect the way Americans eat, love and die. People can dine on genetically engineered salmon. Women can buy emergency contraceptive pills without prescriptions. Military veterans can design their own headstones.The administration\u2019s regulatory legacy has become an issue in the campaign to replace Mr. Obama, as Donald J. Trump has sharply criticized regulatory overreach and promised to undo many of the new rules. But executive power has expanded steadily under both Republican and Democratic presidents in recent decades, and both Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton have promised to act in the service of their own goals.The new rules built on the legislative victories Mr. Obama won during his first two years in office. Those laws \u2014 the Affordable Care Act, the Dodd-Frank Act and the $800 billion economic stimulus package \u2014 transformed the nation\u2019s health care system, curbed the ambitions of the big banks and injected financial support into a creaky economy. But as Republicans increased their control of Capitol Hill, Mr. Obama\u2019s deep frustration with congressional opposition led to a new approach: He gradually embraced a president\u2019s power to act unilaterally.History may now judge the regulations to be one of Mr. Obama\u2019s most enduring legacies. At the least, his exercise of administrative power expanded and cemented a domestic legacy that now rivals Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s Great Society in reach and scope.In May, Mr. Obama was asked by a farmer in Elkhart, Ind., to justify the \u201cdramatic increase\u201d in government regulations that affected his business. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in regulating just for the sake of regulating,\u201d Mr. Obama responded. \u201cBut there are some things like making sure we\u2019ve got clean air and clean water, making sure that folks have health insurance, making sure that worker safety is a priority \u2014 that, I do think, is part of our overall obligation.\u201dInfuriated Republicans describe many of the new rules as unwarranted, resulting in \u201cless jobs, less businesses, less prosperity, lower take-home pay,\u201d in the words of the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan. Business groups, also incensed, have challenged a number of new regulations in court, delaying them or preventing them from taking effect. Some economic experts worry that the accumulation of regulation is contributing to the economy\u2019s persistent sluggishness.\u201cThe big issue that I grapple with is that the regulatory state keeps growing,\u201d said Robert Hahn, an economist and a regulatory expert at the Smith School at the University of Oxford. \u201cAnd as it keeps growing, when does it become too much?\u201dMr. Obama entered office in January 2009 determined to make his mark by passing bold new laws, not by tinkering with rules. Rahm Emanuel, his first chief of staff, and other top aides mapped out an ambitious two-year agenda that included a health care overhaul, new banking laws, a remake of the federal student loan program, infrastructure spending and stricter limits on pollution.\u201cThe president is not somebody who is intuitively or inherently a regulator,\u201d said Howard Shelanski, who followed Mr. Sunstein in that role in mid-2013. He said Mr. Obama conveyed a simple message: \u201c\u2018If we can get a good result without regulating, let\u2019s do that.\u2019\u201dBut after eight years of a Republican administration, many Democrats were eager for the government to lean more forcefully on the levers of regulatory power, and officials within the federal bureaucracy felt emboldened.The White House did resist some ideas. It shut down efforts by Lisa Jackson, Mr. Obama\u2019s first administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, to increase the regulation of ozone, a decision that environmentalists viewed as a betrayal.But other rules were allowed to proceed. Kate Hanni, an advocate from Napa, Calif., for the rights of airline passengers, had tried for years to persuade the government to address a series of incidents in which flight delays left passengers trapped for hours on planes that had already left the gate, often in cabins with stinking toilets, weak air-conditioning and no food. The Bush administration put Ms. Hanni on a task force consisting mostly of airline executives, which concluded in the fall of 2008 \u2014 over her forceful and repeated objections \u2014 that the public was best served by allowing the airlines to make their own decisions.Weeks after the task force released its report, Ms. Hanni was invited to Washington in December 2008 to meet with Robert S. Rivkin, the head of Mr. Obama\u2019s transportation transition team. Democrats in Congress had introduced legislation to address the issue, but Mr. Rivkin asked Ms. Hanni if she would support new regulations instead. She would back anything enforceable, Ms. Hanni said.\u201cRight answer,\u201d he replied.Over the course of the next nine months, Mr. Rivkin and his team of career regulators at the Department of Transportation developed rules prohibiting planes loaded with passengers from sitting on the tarmac for more than three hours.In meetings with Ray LaHood, Mr. Obama\u2019s first transportation secretary, and his staff, airline representatives argued for flexibility, saying rigid timelines would only increase flight cancellations. They chafed at the regulators\u2019 willingness to see the benefits but not the costs.Sharon L. Pinkerton, an executive at Airlines for America, the industry\u2019s main trade group, recalled Transportation Department regulators suggesting that \u201cunquantifiable, unidentifiable benefits\u201d would \u201coutweigh the costs\u201d of new rules for the airlines.\u201cWhat are we supposed to do with that?\u201d she asked later in an interview.But Mr. LaHood had himself experienced long waits on the runway during frequent trips home to Illinois. Just days before Christmas in 2009, he announced a Passenger Bill of Rights, which for the first time levied fines of up to $27,500 per passenger on airlines that leave domestic flights stranded for more than three hours. He challenged the major carriers to provide their service \u201cin a way that is halfway convenient\u201d for their customers.His department, Mr. LaHood said in a recent interview, had a new sense of purpose, independent of any specific directive from the White House.\u201cThey had other fish to fry,\u201d Mr. LaHood said of senior officials at the White House. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to wait around for Congress to take five, 10 years to do this. We could do this by rule and regulation, so we were pretty much off to the races.\u201dOther agencies were moving too. In its second year, bureaucrats working across the government completed 96 major rules, more than in any subsequent year.The White House soon began to take a greater interest in regulation.Passing legislation to address the problem was unlikely, Mr. Emanuel knew, given entrenched ideological opposition and the White House\u2019s focus on overhauling the health insurance system. But Nancy-Ann DeParle, director of the newly created Office of Health Reform, suggested an alternative: The administration had the power to impose conditions on hospitals that got federal Medicare funding.A year later, the president directed the Department of Health and Human Services to develop regulations requiring hospitals to extend visitation rights to same-sex partners.A focus on similar issues produced more than 100 executive actions and regulatory changes intended to improve the lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, particularly after the Supreme Court in 2013 struck down the federal law that defined marriage as between a man and a woman.People with H.I.V. were no longer barred from entry into the country; federal housing rules recognized lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender families; health insurance companies were barred from discriminating against gay people; labor protections applied to gay couples; married same-sex couples could take family and medical leave; and the Internal Revenue Service started treating same-sex couples no differently.\u201cThese are really lasting things,\u201d said David Stacy, the government affairs director for the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights advocacy organization. \u201cThey affect people in their everyday lives.\u201dAs the Obama administration turned toward regulation, it sought to strengthen its hand by changing the estimates of what a life is worth. Those estimates allowed the administration to argue that the benefits of many regulations were greater than previously appreciated. This push was particularly important as a justification for stronger environmental protections.A White House push to pass a sweeping climate change bill in 2009 failed to pass in Congress, but almost from the outset some of Mr. Obama\u2019s aides were working on a Plan B. Mr. Sunstein and Michael Greenstone, the first chief economist of Mr. Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, created an internal task force to put a dollar figure on the cost of carbon emissions.The government does not try to quantify all the benefits of proposed regulations. When it came to environmental regulations, the calculation was particularly limited. Analysts often assigned a dollar figure to just one kind of damage \u2014 emissions of \u201csmall particles\u201d \u2014 and then stacked up the costs of the proposal against the benefits of fewer particles.The Obama White House has issued hundreds of major regulations in an effort to reshape aspects of American life.Quantifying a second kind of damage, from carbon emissions, would broaden the assessed benefits of new regulations \u2014 potentially justifying new and stronger restrictions. In 2010, the administration issued a report that estimated the economic impact of global warming, including agricultural disruptions, increased flooding and health problems. It pegged the cost of carbon emissions at $21 per ton. An updated assessment in 2013 raised the price tag to $33.When the administration announced stricter standards for automobile fuel efficiency in 2011, it cited the reduction in carbon emissions as a key benefit. Those benefits have since been cited in several dozen new regulations, including the hotly debated 2015 rule seeking to restrict emissions from new power plants.Regulators also revisited a more fundamental concept: the value of life. Not just a theological or philosophical abstraction, that figure is used to assess how much spending the government should require to prevent death or injury.The Department of Transportation, for example, increased the estimated value of preventing one death from $6.6 million in 2009 to $9.4 million last year, adjusting for inflation. The department made an even larger adjustment for preventing injuries, for example raising the value of averting a broken arm from $103,000 in 2009 to $442,000 in 2015, also adjusting for inflation. The increases have helped to justify new requirements for stronger roofs and rearview cameras on automobiles and seatbelts on buses.The new carbon cost estimate, in particular, has drawn fire from industry groups who regard it as an arbitrary assessment intended to further an environmental agenda.Mr. Greenstone, in a recent interview, defended the government\u2019s number as a result of a technocratic process that was not influenced by political pressures.\u201cOur job as faceless bureaucrats sitting in windowless rooms was not to do science but to summarize the frontier of science,\u201d he said. \u201c And I feel that we were faithful to that.\u201dBy the fall of 2011, after a summer standoff between the two political parties nearly caused a government shutdown, it was clear to Mr. Obama that little hope remained for moving his agenda forward in a Congress controlled by Republicans.Speaking in Las Vegas that October, Mr. Obama expressed disdain for \u201can increasingly dysfunctional Congress\u201d and pledged: \u201cWhere they won\u2019t act, I will.\u201dThat sentiment kicked off a slow-moving realignment as White House officials held a series of strategy meetings that fall in the Roosevelt Room, first with Mr. Obama on Saturdays and later with agency and policy experts, usually on Tuesdays and Fridays. Led by Ms. DeParle, who had become deputy chief of staff, and Dan Pfeiffer, the communications director, they asked: What can we do without Congress?\u201cIt\u2019s certainly true that we learned by about the third year that the answer to every challenge isn\u2019t going to be legislative,\u201d said Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, now director of Mr. Obama\u2019s Domestic Policy Council.The pace of regulation stalled somewhat in 2012, amid political concerns about announcing sweeping new regulations during the campaign. In 2013, Mr. Obama\u2019s team briefly hoped his victory would lead to legislative progress, but Republicans blocked gun control measures and an immigration overhaul, and partisan gridlock shut the government down for 15 days that October.In early 2014, the moment was finally ripe. Mr. Obama recruited John D. Podesta, then the head of the Center for American Progress, a liberal research and policy institution, to be his counselor in the White House\u201cThe weight, if you will, changed with a very recalcitrant Republican House, and with both the House and the Senate being part of the \u2018Nyet!\u2019 caucus,\u201d Mr. Podesta said. \u201cIt meant that you had to be seriously concerned with trying to make change happen with the tools that you had available.\u201dIn January 2014 a frustrated president stood before Congress and declared \u201ca year of action\u201d \u2014 with or without the help of the Republicans arrayed before him.\u201cWhenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d Mr. Obama said in his State of the Union address.Mr. Obama announced an executive order raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour for several hundred thousand cooks, janitors and other federal contract workers. In subsequent orders, each resulting in a new regulation, the president required contractors to let their workers take paid sick days and banned discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender workers. He also increased workplace protections for all workers at businesses that held federal contracts \u2014 an umbrella covering roughly 29 million workers.\u201cWhat the president was ultimately doing was holding up the United States government as a model employer,\u201d said Joseph Geevarghese, director of Good Jobs Nation, a union-backed advocacy group that pressed the administration to embrace its regulatory power. \u201cAnd it created a ripple effect. Within months of the president acting you had private C.E.O.s \u2014 Ikea, Gap, Disney, airlines \u2014 saying they too were going to boost minimum pay.\u201dThe new regulations again required the White House to broaden its assessment of regulatory benefits. During Mr. Obama\u2019s first term, administration officials told Mr. Geevarghese and other activists that the government did not have the power to make such changes. But after Mr. Obama\u2019s re-election, they found a way: White House lawyers concluded that the president could impose requirements on contractors in the interest of taxpayers.Betsey Stevenson, a member of the president\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, took the lead in building a case that contractors who paid higher wages would attract and retain better workers, increasing their productivity.The theory holds, for example, that if the lunch lines at a federal office building moved a little more quickly because of more competent, motivated cafeteria workers, every employee in those lines would save a few minutes a day and have more time to work, thus increasing productivity.The idea has its roots in work by George Akerlof, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, and his wife, Janet Yellen, now chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, who decided in the early 1980s to pay their babysitter above-market wages as motivation.With the president\u2019s blessing, the E.P.A. also became more aggressive. The agency asserted federal authority to protect thousands of waterways and wetlands, proposed to cap carbon emissions at new and existing power plants, raised emissions standards for trucks and airplanes, and called for new limits on methane, mercury and ozone.\u201cHe has been much more ambitious and aggressive on environmental regulation than any other president we\u2019ve had,\u201d said Jeffrey Holmstead, a lawyer pursuing legal challenges to some of Mr. Obama\u2019s signature environmental rules.Courts have now temporarily blocked the administration\u2019s water rules and delayed the power plant limits on carbon dioxide emissions. The next administration will also have considerable leeway to determine how quickly new rules are carried out, and how strictly enforced.Every president promises to prune the federal rule book.Mr. Obama has tried to formalize the process for reviewing existing regulations, and the two candidates vying to take his place, Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump, have nodded at the need to ease the burdens of regulation.But the scope of federal regulation has continued to grow, and the trend is likely to continue. Presidents, both Democratic and Republican, have asserted greater power in recent decades to dictate the shape of regulations, while Congress has become less specific in its instructions.\u201cWe live in an era of presidential administration,\u201d Elena Kagan, a Harvard law professor since appointed by Mr. Obama to the Supreme Court, wrote in a 2001 paper that reviewed the expansion of the regulatory state.Both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump would most likely face significant congressional opposition to their major campaign promises. To sidestep Congress, they now have the legacy of Mr. Obama. Mr. Podesta, now Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, said the appeal of taking action without Congress is hard to resist.\u201cYou come in with a strategy of going to the Hill, certainly where you can find some cooperation,\u201d Mr. Podesta said. But when that fails, writing regulations \u201cis a way to get much more substantial throw-weight behind solving the problem.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the role of Michael Greenstone on the Council of Economic Advisers. He was its first chief economist under President Obama, not its first head.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China, Not Silicon Valley, Is Cutting Edge in Mobile Tech", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAll of these developments have something in common: The technology was first popularized in China.Silicon Valley has long been the world\u2019s tech capital: It birthed social networking and iPhones and spread those tech products across the globe. The rap on China has been that it always followed in the Valley\u2019s footsteps as government censorship abetted the rise of local versions of Google, YouTube and Twitter.But China\u2019s tech industry \u2014 particularly its mobile businesses \u2014 has in some ways pulled ahead of the United States. Some Western tech companies, even the behemoths, are turning to Chinese firms for ideas.\u201cWe just see China as further ahead,\u201d said Ted Livingston, the founder of Kik, which is headquartered in Waterloo, Ontario.The shift suggests that China could have a greater say in the global tech industry\u2019s direction. Already in China, more people use their mobile devices to pay their bills, order services, watch videos and find dates than anywhere else in the world. Mobile payments in the country last year surpassed those in the United States. By some estimates, loans from a new breed of informal online banks called peer-to-peer lenders did too.The future of online payments and engagements can be found at Liu Zheng\u2019s noodle shop in central Beijing. Liu Xiu\u2019e, 60, and her neighbor, Zhang Lixin, 55, read about the noodle shop on WeChat. Then they ordered and paid for their lunches and took and posted selfies of themselves outside the restaurant, all using the same app.Liu Zheng, who is not related to Liu Xiu\u2019e, said the automated ordering and payments meant he could cut down on wages for waiters. \u201cIn the future, we will only need one waiter to help in the restaurant and one to help with seating,\u201d Mr. Liu said.Before Venmo became the app for millennials to transfer money in the United States, both young and old in China were investing, reimbursing each other, paying bills,and buying products from stores with smartphone-based digital wallets.\u201cQuite frankly, the trope that China copies the U.S. hasn\u2019t been true for years, and in mobile it\u2019s the opposite: The U.S. often copies China,\u201d said Ben Thompson, the founder of the tech research firm Stratechery. \u201cFor the Facebook Messenger app, for example, the best way to understand their road map is to look at WeChat.\u201dA Facebook spokesman declined to comment. Tencent did not respond to requests for comment.Executives from companies like Facebook and smaller rivals like Kik are trying to replicate what has emerged in China: dominant online platforms where users will spend much of their time. Much of that effort is focused on chat.\u201cThe cool thing about chat is it becomes an operating system for your daily life,\u201d Mr. Livingston said. \u201cGoing up to a vending machine, ordering food, getting a cab: Chat can power those interactions, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing with WeChat.\u201dThe biggest advantage for China\u2019s tech industry, according to many analysts, is that it was able to fill a vacuum after the country essentially created much of its economy from scratch following the end of the Cultural Revolution, in 1976. Unlike in the United States, where banks and retailers already have strong holds on customers, China\u2019s state-run lenders are inefficient, and retailers never expanded broadly enough to serve a fast-growing middle class.Many Chinese also never bought a personal computer, meaning smartphones are the primary \u2014 and often first \u2014 computing device for the more than 600 million who have them in China.\u201cThe U.S. was first to credit cards, and everyone there has a personal computer. But China, where everyone is on their phones all the time, is now ahead in mobile commerce and mobile payments by virtue of leapfrogging the PC and credit cards,\u201d Mr. Thompson said.Chinese companies also approach the internet in a different way. In the United States, tech firms emphasize simplicity in their apps. But in China, its three major internet companies \u2014 Alibaba, Baidu and the WeChat parent Tencent \u2014 compete to create a single app with as many functions as they can stuff into it.On Alibaba\u2019s Taobao shopping app, people can also buy groceries, buy credits for online games, scan coupons and find deals at stores nearby. Baidu\u2019s mapping app lets users order an Uber, reserve a restaurant or hotel, order in food, buy movie tickets and find just about any type of store nearby.Tencent has opened up WeChat to other companies, allowing them to create apps within WeChat. Ebaoyang \u2014 a start-up that enables people to order oil changes for their cars directly on smartphones \u2014 was at first almost totally reliant on WeChat to attract business. Gao Feng, one of Ebaoyang\u2019s founders, said the company still relied on the app for 50 percent of its payments and 20 percent of new customers.\u201cWe started from WeChat. So it was our main, original source for getting customers,\u201d he said.Between fees for its services and money it makes through online games, WeChat manages to generate $7 in revenue per user each year, according to Nomura. The app has roughly 700 million users, more than the total number of smartphone users in China, in part because some users are outside the country and in part because people have multiple accounts.Much of that comes not from ads, as it might in the United States, but from spending on games, services and goods sold on the app. Those models may not translate from one market to the other, but the two can still borrow from each other, said Carmen Chang, a partner at the venture capital firm New Enterprise Associates.\u201cChina was able to develop a lot of innovative business models, which arose in a different kind of economy,\u201d said Ms. Chang, who spends time in both China and in Menlo Park, Calif. \u201cWhether or not we admit it here in Silicon Valley, it\u2019s had an impact on us and our thinking.\u201dCao Li in Beijing contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Economic Team: Bankers and Billionaires (and All Men)", "Date": "2016-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDonald J. Trump may rail against Wall Street and business elites at his campaign rallies, but that has not stopped him from turning to many of them for economic advice. On Friday, Mr. Trump announced his economic team, just days before he is expected to give a speech in Detroit on Monday about what he would do to improve American growth.The 13-member team \u2014 all men \u2014 includes several billionaire bankers and investment managers, and even a part-time professional poker player. Many have been in business with Mr. Trump before. Having such moguls on the team not only expands Mr. Trump\u2019s network of Wall Street donors and contacts, but may also reassure the financial community that it need not be too alarmed by some of the candidate\u2019s populist oratory. Even so, several of those named often have expressed views against the economic mainstream, voicing suspicions about the Federal Reserve and global trade deals.\u201cThey certainly can provide many useful insights, assuming Trump is willing to listen to them \u2013 it\u2019s just I would like to see more diversity in terms of expertise and background,\u201d said James Pethokoukis, a commentator at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. He noted that the group was heavily weighted toward developers, hedge fund managers and bankers, with hardly any representatives from Silicon Valley or academia. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how well the expertise on that list really matches up with some of the challenges facing the American economy.\u201dKevin A. Hassett, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, was also surprised at how few economists were selected. \u201cMost campaigns tend to balance academics with business folks, like those on this list,\u201d he said. As for whether the advisers will wield much influence, Mr. Hassett said, \u201cIt is pretty common for campaigns to have a long list of well-known business leaders who act as \u2018advisers,\u2019 but there is a large variation in how active they really are.\u201dThe team will be led by Stephen Miller, the national director of policy for the campaign, and Dan Kowalski, the deputy director.

{"Headline": "Bank of England Cuts Interest Rate to Historic Low, Citing Economic Pressures", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe move comes at a time of widespread uncertainty about the longer-term impact of the vote to leave the bloc, known as Brexit. It is unclear what Britain\u2019s future trading relationship will be with the European Union, and crucially, how much access London\u2019s prized financial services industry will have to the Continent. The referendum also unleashed a summer of political turmoil that led to a new government and to questions about the new leadership\u2019s economic policies.\u201cThere is a clear case for stimulus, and stimulus now, in order to be there when the economy really needs it \u2014 to have an effect when the economy really needs it,\u201d Mark J. Carney, the bank\u2019s governor, said at a news conference on Thursday.The central bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee voted unanimously to lower its benchmark interest rate to 0.25 percent, the lowest level in the bank\u2019s 322 years. The rate had been at 0.5 percent since March 2009.Mr. Carney also signaled on Thursday that the committee could cut rates further this year, but he ruled out the possibility of negative interest rates. The committee\u2019s next meeting is set for November.The bank also said that it would introduce a series of additional measures to support the economy, predicting that there would be little growth in the second half of this year and that economic growth would decline sharply next year compared with its earlier forecast for 2017.\u201cThis is a timely, coherent and comprehensive package of measures,\u201d Mr. Carney said. \u201cIt is appropriately sized given the scale of the shock, the uncertainties about the degree of the adjustment and the relatively limited data.\u201dThose measures included increasing the size of a bond-buying program, part of a policy known as quantitative easing, which is intended to cut market interest rates and stimulate the economy.The bank said on Thursday that it would buy an additional 60 billion pounds, or about $80 billion, in assets under the program, increasing the total to \u00a3435 billion.The Bank of England also said that it would buy up to \u00a310 billion in investment grade corporate bonds from nonfinancial companies. It stipulated that the bonds must be traded in pounds and that the companies must be \u201cmaking a material contribution\u201d to the British economy. The new private-sector bond buying program is expected to begin next month.The bank will choose from a pool of about 150 companies, accounting for about \u00a3150 billion in corporate bonds, according to Minouche Shafik, the central bank\u2019s deputy governor for markets and banking.The central bank also said it would start a program to make it easier for banks to provide lower lending rates to households and businesses, and would penalize the banks if the net level of lending fell.\u201cDemand is expected to be markedly weaker, and unemployment higher, than projected in May,\u201d Mr. Carney said on Thursday in a letter to Philip Hammond, the chancellor of the Exchequer.Lucy O\u2019Carroll, chief economist at Aberdeen Asset Management, said Mr. Carney was clear in his message on Thursday that monetary policy could go only so far in supporting the economy in light of the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote.\u201cWhat will really count is whether the chancellor provides a fiscal boost in the autumn,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Carroll said, referring to a planned budget update this year. \u201cMonetary policy can\u2019t do much more on its own.\u201dIn cutting its economic growth forecasts for the coming years, the central bank on Thursday said it expected the economy to grow at about 2 percent in 2016, but at a slower rate in the second half of the year.It projected gross domestic product would grow at 0.8 percent in 2017, and 1.8 percent in 2018. It had predicted the economy would expand 2.3 percent in each of those years.It was the biggest downgrade between inflation reports since the central bank began making public forecasts in 1993.The central bank also said it believed that the annual inflation rate over the next three years would surpass its policy target of 2 percent, reaching 2.4 percent in 2018 as a weak currency pushed up the prices of imported goods and services.The bank sees a 2 percent inflation rate as a sign of healthy economic growth. Twelve-month consumer price inflation stood at 0.5 percent in June.An earlier photograph and picture caption with this article were published in error.

With Mrs. Clinton leading in several battleground states, Florida could prove essential for Mr. Trump\u2019s chances in November.\u201cThe gender split among white voters in Florida is huge,\u201d said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. \u201cMen are drawn to Trump\u2019s message while women are not.

More Florida voters now see the Democratic nominee as being better suited to steer the economy, create jobs and handle the threat of an attack on American soil.According to the Monmouth poll, a majority of Florida voters are not aware that Mr. Rubio endorsed Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential bid, and most who do know say it will not determine if they vote for him.The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fed Is Searching for a New Framework. New Minutes Show It Doesn\u2019t Have One Yet.", "Date": "2016-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolicy PuzzleThe quandary facing the Federal Reserve this summer is the same as it was back in the spring, and winter, and last fall: By traditional guideposts like the unemployment rate, it looks as if it is time for the Fed to be raising interest rates. Yet the global economy seems to be locked in a low-growth, low-inflation world in which raising interest rates is at best unnecessary and at worst dangerous.That tension was on display Wednesday in the minutes of the Fed\u2019s last policy meeting, which raised the possibility of rate increases as early as September.As is the Fed\u2019s standard practice, the description of the meeting was stripped of names and summarized in bloodless language. But reading between the lines, it is clear there was a rich debate over what factors the Fed should be weighing, and how, in making its next move.Some policy makers saw evidence that the labor market was getting tighter, the result of which should be higher wages and prices. Others \u201csaw little evidence that inflation was responding much\u201d to the low jobless rate. With inflation low, \u201cmany judged it was appropriate to wait for additional information\u201d before considering raising rates.\u201cSeveral\u201d suggested there would be plenty of time to react if inflation did rise and so wanted to defer raising rates until it was clear inflation was holding near its desired target of 2 percent. \u201cSome other participants\u201d viewed the economy as already being near full employment, meaning that another rate increase \u201cwas or would soon be\u201d warranted.The result of all that debate at the July 26-27 meeting was affirming the status quo \u2014 agreement that \u201cit was prudent to accumulate more data in order to gauge the underlying momentum in the labor market and economic activity\u201d and that \u201cmembers judged it appropriate to continue to leave their policy options open and maintain the flexibility to adjust the stance of policy based on incoming information.\u201dThat continues a volatile year for market perceptions of when, and how much, the Fed might make the shift toward tighter money. At the start of 2016, it seemed nearly certain the Fed would follow up its interest rate increase in December with more of them this year.Weak growth in the United States and abroad, combined with a volatile first half of the year in financial markets, drove the odds of a rate increase down to 12 percent by July 1, based on prices in futures markets. That had gone back up to 53 percent by Tuesday. (It edged down very slightly, to 51 percent, after the release of the minutes Wednesday.)In public comments this week, Fed officials have suggested that markets are underrating the possibility of a September rate increase.The Fed faces a profound question: Is the basic framework it has used over the last generation to set monetary policy the correct one in this moment, or has something fundamental shifted in the global economy that calls for a new one?If this is just a standard economic expansion that has been slowed by some bad luck, then the central bank\u2019s usual rules apply. That rule book involves examining how close the economy is to functioning at its full potential, and trying to move up and down to keep on that steady path so as not to let inflation get out of control.By that standard, it is past time to be raising interest rates. The unemployment rate is 4.9 percent, around the level the Fed believes is sustainable in the longer term, and job growth is strong. Inflation was 1.4 percent over the last year, according to the index the Fed watches most closely, not too far below the 2 percent the Fed aims for. And mainstream economic models project it should rise in the years ahead given the relatively tight job market.But there is plenty of evidence \u2014 and a vocal contingent of officials inside the central bank \u2014 that the usual way of thinking isn\u2019t quite working.For one thing, the rest of the world is growing so slowly that it is creating a steady downdraft on inflation and growth that may mean the usual worries about inflation don\u2019t apply. Rising wages for American workers over the last year or so have been counteracted by other forces preventing inflation from taking off, including falling energy prices and slack demand for goods and services from overseas.Moreover, any step the Fed takes toward tightening the United States money supply seems to be offset by an opposite reaction elsewhere. With other countries easing monetary policy with ultralow interest rates and quantitative easing, small moves to tighten American policies have created outsize rallies in the dollar, which disadvantages American exporters and creates ripple effects through the global credit system.That has led Fed officials to steadily mark down both their expectations for how quickly to raise short-term interest rates and where those rates will settle in the longer run \u2014 meaning they think that low rates may be more a new normal than a short-term aberration.The Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, will have a prime opportunity to elaborate on her own views in this debate next week, in a scheduled speech at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\u2019s annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo.But for now, Fed officials are openly discussing the need to approach policy choices differently, and holding off from interest rate increases as a result, but not quite concluding that the old rules no longer apply and embracing an alternate approach.It\u2019s an awkward place for a central bank to be, but until Ms. Yellen and her colleagues can find consensus around what the new framework for monetary policy ought to be \u2014 or conclude that the old models still have some usefulness \u2014 the uncertainty evident in the July minutes won\u2019t change.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "States of Cruelty", "Date": "2016-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere\u2019s an important civics lesson here. While many people are focused on national politics, with reason \u2014 one sociopath in the White House can ruin your whole day \u2014 many crucial decisions are taken at the state and local levels. If the people we elect to these offices are irresponsible, cruel, or both, they can do a lot of damage.Needless to say, nothing like this has happened in red states. And while the number of uninsured has declined even in these states, thanks to the federal exchanges, the gap between red and blue states has widened.But why are states like Texas so dead-set against helping the unfortunate, even if the feds are willing to pick up the tab?You still hear claims that it\u2019s all about economics, that small government and free markets are the key to prosperity. And it\u2019s true that Texas has long led the nation in employment growth. But there are other reasons for that growth, especially energy and cheap housing.So the economic case for being cruel to the unfortunate has lost whatever slight credibility it may once have had. Yet the cruelty goes on. Why?A large part of the answer, surely, is the usual one: It\u2019s about race. Medicaid expansion disproportionately benefits nonwhite Americans; so does spending on public health more generally. And opposition to these programs is concentrated in states where voters in local elections don\u2019t like the idea of helping neighbors who don\u2019t look like them.In the specific case of Planned Parenthood, this usual answer is overlaid with other, equally nasty issues, including \u2014 or so I\u2019d say \u2014 a substantial infusion of misogyny.But it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Most Americans are, I believe, far more generous than the politicians leading many of our states. The problem is that too many of us don\u2019t vote in state and local elections, or realize how much cruelty is being carried out in our name. The point is that America would become a better place if more of us started paying attention to politics beyond the presidential race.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Corporate America Is Leaving the Suburbs for the City", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWILMINGTON, Del. \u2014 For decades, many of the nation\u2019s biggest companies staked their futures far from the fraying downtowns of aging East Coast and Midwestern cities. One after another, they decamped for sprawling campuses in the suburbs and exurbs.Now, corporate America is moving in the other direction.In June, McDonald\u2019s joined a long list of companies that are returning to downtown Chicago from suburbs like Oak Brook, Northfield and Schaumburg.Later this month, the top executive team at General Electric \u2014 whose 70-acre wooded campus in Fairfield, Conn., has embodied the quintessential suburban corporate office park since it opened in 1974 \u2014 will move to downtown Boston. When the move is completed in 2018, the renovated red brick warehouses that will form part of G.E.\u2019s new headquarters won\u2019t even have a parking lot, let alone a spot reserved for the chief executive.But even as they establish new urban beachheads, business giants like G.E. are also changing the nature of their headquarters, staffing them with a few top white-collar employees and a smattering of digital talent, rather than recreating the endless Dilbert-like pods they once built in the \u2019burbs.\u201cPart of it is that cities are more attractive places to live than they were 30 years ago and are more willing to provide tax incentives, and young people want to be there,\u201d said David J. Collis, who teaches corporate strategy at Harvard Business School.\u201cBut the trend also represents the deconstruction and disaggregation of the traditional corporate headquarters,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe executive suite might be downtown, but you could have the back office and administrative functions in Colorado, the finance guys in Switzerland and the tax team in the U.K.\u201dReinforcing the trend, Chemours plans to announce on Tuesday that it is staying here in Wilmington after considering suburban locations, most likely in the century-old headquarters it inherited from DuPont when the chemical giant spun out Chemours last year.Unlike Chicago and Boston, Wilmington\u2019s urban renaissance remains a work in progress, and Chemours was very close to moving to a new home in southern New Jersey or suburban Philadelphia, despite the DuPont family\u2019s deep roots in Wilmington and the state of Delaware.But the company\u2019s chief executive, Mark Vergnano, ultimately came to the same conclusion that leaders of bigger and better-known firms did: To attract younger workers, it helps to be in the city.\u201cWe are going through a change in our work force, and we wanted to be where we could attract millennials,\u201d Mr. Vergnano said. \u201cThis is a group that likes to be in an urban setting, with access to public transportation. They don\u2019t want to be confined to a building with a cafeteria or be next door to a shopping center.\u201dTo be sure, cash from the State of Delaware and other incentives played an important role in the decision as well.In addition to providing Chemours, which produces a range of industrial chemical products, with a $7.9 million package of grants, Delaware overhauled its corporate tax code, sacrificing revenue and easing the company\u2019s tax burden as an added lure to stay put.For Wilmington, where the unemployment rate of 5.7 percent is above both the national average and Delaware\u2019s overall 4.2 percent level of joblessness, keeping Chemours\u2019s 800 headquarters jobs in the city counts as a major win.\u201cIn a more perfect world, states would be competing on the quality of schools, infrastructure, work force and so forth,\u201d said Gov. Jack A. Markell of Delaware. \u201cWe live in a world that\u2019s not perfect, so if other states are competing on the basis of these dollar incentives, we need to be in the same arena.\u201dIn an era of relentless cost-cutting, many corporate moves these days coincide with downsizing. Kraft Heinz, for example, had 2,200 workers when the company was based in Northfield; it has 1,500 now in downtown Chicago.With advanced communications tools making it easier than ever to separate headquarters from other corporate operations, location is increasingly being driven by function.The first 175 members of G.E.\u2019s management team, including Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive, will move to Boston\u2019s Fort Point section on Aug. 22. Even after the move is completed, about 800 G.E. employees will be based there. Hundreds of other workers in back-office functions like human resources, legal and finance will be scattered among G.E\u2019s existing locations in Cincinnati, Norwalk, Conn., and Schenectady, N.Y.The headquarters of Motorola Solutions will start moving to downtown Chicago on Aug. 15, though more workers will stay in suburban Schaumburg than move to the new offices near Union Station. But for the first time in half a century, top executives from the company will again be in downtown Chicago.\u201cWhere you work really matters,\u201d said Greg Brown, the chief executive of Motorola Solutions. \u201cNo disrespect to Schaumburg, but customers and new hires didn\u2019t want to come to the suburbs an hour outside of Chicago. We wanted energy, vibrancy and diversity, and to accelerate a change in our culture by moving downtown.\u201dMr. Brown and most of the executive team will be in the city, along with data scientists and design engineers; workaday functions like procurement, training and supply chain management will stay in Schaumburg.Over all, Motorola Solutions will have 1,100 employees in downtown Chicago, and 1,600 still in Schaumburg. Unlike many other corporate migrants, the company did not receive any financial incentives to move, Mr. Brown said.\u201cThis was the right thing in terms of strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cMillennials want the access and vibrancy of downtown. When we post jobs downtown, we get four or five times the response.\u201dAs for G.E., executives were focused on moving to a city from the beginning of its search for a new headquarters, said Ann R. Klee, director of Boston operations and development for the company.Along with eliminating the parking lot (workers are being encouraged to use public transit) G.E. wanted to do away with security gates and the sense of isolation that characterizes many corporate campuses.\u201cThis is going to be the exact opposite,\u201d Ms. Klee said. \u201cWe want it to be open and to bring the public in with a museum and exhibits of technology like 3-D printers.\u201dBesides blue-chip icons like G.E., McDonald\u2019s and Kraft Heinz, venture capital investors and start-ups are increasingly looking to urban centers, particularly on the West Coast, said Richard Florida, an urban theorist and professor at the University of Toronto.\u201cThe period of companies moving to suburbs and edge cities has ebbed, but I had thought that start-ups would continue to locate in so-called nerdistans, like office parks,\u201d he said. But a recent study by Mr. Florida showed more than half of new venture capital flowing into urban neighborhoods, with two San Francisco ZIP codes garnering more than $1 billion each, he said.The return of a top echelon of executives to American cities reflects \u2014 and may well reinforce \u2014 disparities driven by widening inequality, underscoring how jobs are disappearing in other locales.Over all, there has been a slight pickup in employment and population in the central core of big cities, said Joel Kotkin, an author and urban geographer at Chapman University in California. But many close-in suburbs and neighborhoods are withering, particularly in the Northeast. More distant suburbs and exurbs are still thriving, especially in the Sun Belt.\u201cThe elite functions are going downtown,\u201d Mr. Kotkin said. \u201cBut at the same time, middle-management jobs are moving to the suburbs in places like Dallas, if they\u2019re not leaving the country entirely.\u201dIn Wilmington, local shopkeepers were elated that Chemours decided not to follow its former corporate parent, DuPont, to the suburbs. \u201cAnybody who has a business in downtown Wilmington doesn\u2019t want to lose Chemours,\u201d said Leonard Simon, whose family-owned men\u2019s clothing store, Wright & Simon, has been around the corner from Chemours since 1952. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled.\u201dJeffrey C. Flynn, director of economic development for Wilmington, said that the advantages of city life ultimately proved to be a compelling selling point.\u201cWe\u2019re not Philadelphia,\u201d Mr. Flynn said, \u201cbut we do have an urban atmosphere.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Driven to Suicide by an \u2018Inhuman and Unnatural\u2019 Pressure to Sell", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byINDORE, India \u2014 Leaving his wife and two young children home on a recent Sunday, a 27-year-old salesman for Abbott Laboratories\u2019 operations in India \u2014 in fact, one of the American health care company\u2019s top performers there \u2014 rode his motorcycle to a remote railroad track and jumped in front of a train.In his pocket, a note in blue ink, handwritten in a mix of Hindi and English, said, \u201cI\u2019m going to commit suicide because I can\u2019t meet my company\u2019s sales targets and my company is pressuring me.\u201dAshish Awasthi\u2019s death last month resonated across India and through the halls of the health care giant. More than 250 fellow Abbott drug representatives in India walked off the job for a day, protesting what some called the company\u2019s overly aggressive sales policies. A national union of drug sales workers called for new government rules to rein in sales practices industrywide, saying they compromised patient health.A six-month investigation by The New York Times found that in the push to win customers in India\u2019s chaotic and highly competitive drug market, some Abbott managers instructed employees to pursue sales at virtually any cost \u2014 in violation of Indian law, professional medical standards and the company\u2019s own ethics guidelines.Sales jobs with global powerhouses like Abbott are highly prized positions in India. But they can also be extremely demanding, putting employees under inordinate pressure to cut corners, according to interviews with more than a dozen current and former sales representatives and managers and a review of internal Abbott communications provided by two of them.In one of the most common practices, The Times found, Abbott managers told sales staff to hold what the company called health camps, where representatives would perform tests on patients for various ailments in an effort to drum up business for doctors, who would then prescribe Abbott drugs. The camps were typically held at doctor\u2019s offices or as community events.Abbott India\u2019s public affairs director, Anand Kadkol, said the company\u2019s marketing policies \u201care aligned with applicable laws\u201d in India. He called the health camps \u201cdisease awareness education programs\u201d and said that Abbott\u2019s policies did not allow the camps to be conducted \u201cin exchange for an explicit or implicit understanding\u201d to prescribe Abbott products.The company declined to comment on individual employees. Mr. Kadkol said Abbott was \u201caware of a number of the allegations raised\u201d and had addressed them.But Vivek Gupta, a former manager of a sales team in northern India, said he was fired last year under pressure to make his sales representatives do more screenings of patients to promote a new Abbott multivitamin for nerve damage. He tried to resist, he said, out of respect for the national rules and the company\u2019s own policies, which prohibit the use of health camps to influence which medicines are prescribed.Dhirendra Yadav, 26, a former sales agent in central India in the neurology division, said he resigned in December 2013 under what he called \u201cimmense pressure to conduct business in unethical ways.\u201d He said his former manager \u2014 who later became the manager of Mr. Awasthi, the man who committed suicide \u2014 insisted that he use his own money to buy medicines costing nearly 15,000 rupees, or about $220, to help his group meet a sales target. That would be more than half of a typical representative\u2019s monthly pay.Rajeev Khanna, who managed six sales representatives for neurology medicines in northern India, said he was fired after complaining to Abbott\u2019s office of ethics and compliance that his team was submitting fake invoices to increase sales. He described a practice of giving discounts intended for government institutions to private wholesalers as a kickback.Unethical marketing practices are routine in the Indian pharmaceutical market, said Sanjeev Khandelwal, a union secretary who works as a drug salesman at an Indian company.India\u2019s annual drug sales, estimated at $16 billion, may be small by the standards of the United States or Europe, but the market is attractive because it has been growing faster than 10 percent annually in recent years, placing it far ahead of developed markets in terms of growth.In this battle for sales, employees like Mr. Awasthi are the drug companies\u2019 front-line foot soldiers.In an email, Mr. Kadkol, the Abbott India spokesman, said, \u201cWe are deeply saddened to learn of Ashish Awasthi\u2019s tragic demise,\u201d describing him as \u201camong the top performers in 2015.\u201dAs multinationals like Abbott expand in India, they bring something powerfully attractive to the nation\u2019s emerging middle class: jobs. The positions they offer become highly coveted, both for the prestige of working for a global company and because India\u2019s economy \u2014 despite its 7.6 percent growth \u2014 still produces far too few jobs for the one million people who enter the work force each month.This sets the stage for fierce competition for positions like these \u2014 and a desperation to retain them.Mr. Awasthi embodied these ambitions. Hailing from a farming town about 400 miles northeast of Indore, he was one of the countless people who flock to India\u2019s cities with hopes of climbing the economic and social ladder.In December 2013, when Abbott hired him as a salesman, he felt he had won the lottery, said his 27-year-old widow, Anita Awasthi. He told her, \u201cI can do everything for you now,\u201d she recalled recently for visitors who had come to her home to offer their condolences.His job was persuading doctors to use Abbott\u2019s medicines for neurological diseases, and he was a disciplined salesman, according to a former boss, Ramchandra Tiwari. It is a grueling job, Mr. Tiwari said, requiring aggressive efforts to catch doctors\u2019 attention early in the morning or late in the evening.Mr. Awasthi thrived, though. In 2015 he won a top salesman award. The young couple had made many close friends, his wife said, and maintained a busy social life going to movies and visiting area temples. She called theirs the \u201cperfect life.\u201dAnd they began to stretch financially. Mr. Awasthi bought a car \u2014 a sought-after symbol of arrival in the Indian middle class \u2014 and proudly carried a snapshot of it, garlanded with flowers. And he took out a loan to buy a one-bedroom apartment for about $20,000.The purchases meant money was tight, Ms. Awasthi said. Her husband recently asked a friend to borrow about $70 to pay their 7-year-old daughter\u2019s school fees.Still, all was good, she said, until this June, when he got a new manager. According to his previous manager, Mr. Tiwari, the demands on the sales staff rapidly built. Mr. Tiwari described it as \u201cinhuman and unnatural\u201d pressure to sell.The day he was found dead, Mr. Awasthi had been expected to attend a meeting with his new boss. Ms. Awasthi believes her husband \u2014 despite being a top performer \u2014 expected to lose his coveted job that day.From the start, a contentious issue between Mr. Gupta and his managers was Abbott\u2019s use of sales personnel to perform medical tests at health camps.In India, where many people lack affordable care, these mass screenings have become a common way for drug makers to lift sales, according to current and former Abbott sales representatives and managers.The industry-sponsored camps typically focus on chronic ailments such as diabetes, thyroid disorders, heart problems and lung disease. Sales personnel do the testing at no charge, and participating doctors get to increase their business by advertising free checkups. In return, the doctors are expected to prescribe the drug maker\u2019s product.Some experts say these practices raise the prospect that people may be inappropriately diagnosed and could receive unnecessary treatment.Abbott promotes its health camps nationwide as a core part of its \u201ccorporate social responsibility\u201d program, which is intended partly to meet the Indian government\u2019s requirement that companies contribute to the social good. \u201cIf it\u2019s corporate social responsibility, then it shouldn\u2019t be linked to the sales of the brand,\u201d Mr. Gupta said.Mr. Kadkol of Abbott India said, \u201cEmployees are not permitted to perform diagnostic tests.\u201d The company denies that the purpose of the health camps is to have doctors use its drugs.\u201cAbbott\u2019s procedures clearly state that disease awareness programs must not be conducted or provided or offered in exchange for an explicit or implicit understanding to purchase, order, recommend, prescribe or provide favorable treatment to any Abbott products,\u201d Mr. Kadkol said in an email.However, more than a dozen internal emails shared with The Times by Mr. Gupta suggest that Abbott viewed the camps as a sales tool and that the strategy came from Abbott management. In a February 2015 email, a group product manager informed the sales force that January sales of Surbex Star, a vitamin Abbott promotes to treat neuropathy in people with diabetes, were \u201cway behind the expectations.\u201d\u201cNow is the time to bounce back and surpass February target for Surbex Star,\u201d the manager wrote. \u201cHerein below are the 6 easy steps to conduct neuropathy camps.\u201dThe manager did not return phone calls and emails seeking comment.In another email from last year, an Abbott marketing manager told Mr. Gupta and other first-line sales managers that their representatives were supposed to do a minimum of three neuropathy camps per quarter and that they were behind in that goal.\u201cCamps will go a long way in promoting Surbex Star,\u201d the marketing manager said in the email.Several senior managers were copied on both emails.Shrey Agrawal, who wrote that email but is no longer with Abbott, said in a telephone interview that \u201cthere is no direct link\u201d between camps and drug sales. Asked how this tracked with his email about Surbex Star, he said he would respond by email. He never did.In another email last year, an Abbott sales agent boasted that a neuropathy camp he had conducted was \u201ca big success,\u201d noting that 30 of the 40 patients tested positive, and that the doctor prescribed Surbex Star to all 30. He did not respond to requests for an interview.As Mr. Gupta clashed with his bosses, he says, they began calling him and sending messages late at night and on Sundays, and he became depressed. After one particularly intense phone call, he grabbed a hot iron that his wife had just used and pushed it into his hand, searing his flesh and leaving a scar. He had thoughts of killing himself, he said, and saw a psychiatrist, who put him on an antidepressant and an antipsychotic.Soon afterward, his bosses told him they wanted to transfer him 1,500 miles away, to the city of Chennai. He refused to go, he said, interpreting it as an effort to make him quit.In an email to top leaders at Abbott India in August 2015, Mr. Gupta laid out his concerns. He told management that sales representatives were instructed to screen patients to increase sales.As proof that the medical screening was happening, managers were instructing sales personnel to email photos of the tests being performed, Mr. Gupta explained \u2014 but with someone else posing as the tester, to conceal the representatives\u2019 involvement. He said the practices violated Abbott\u2019s code of ethics.Mr. Gupta sent the allegations, and supporting documents, to the company\u2019s office of ethics and compliance in India as well. The Times has reviewed the documents.Last autumn, Mr. Gupta was fired. He was told he had lost the managers\u2019 confidence, he said. Today he works for a hospital.In response to allegations that the camps were improperly used to induce doctors to write prescriptions, Mr. Kadkol of Abbott India said, \u201cThat just doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d He noted that such camps were \u201cnot exclusive to a company,\u201d adding, \u201cThey happen in many companies across many geographies.\u201dRegarding Mr. Gupta\u2019s other claims, Mr. Kadkol said, \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on the details of internal compliance investigations.\u201dMr. Gupta\u2019s former boss, Anup Ray, said in an interview that the purpose of the health camps was for doctors to prescribe Surbex Star. That made Mr. Gupta \u201cuncomfortable,\u201d Mr. Ray said. \u201cI was also against it.\u201dMr. Khanna, the former Abbott manager who said he was fired after complaining about questionable sales made at discounted government rates, oversaw a team of neurology-medicine sales representatives in Lucknow, in northern India. Now 48, he had worked for 25 years for Abbott, Solvay and a company it acquired.In 2013, he said, he began to notice the rapid rise in sales at the government discount. Suspicious that the sales were a form of a kickback to wholesalers, to induce more orders, he asked his sales staff and the wholesalers to produce original copies of the orders from government institutions, which they failed to do, Abbott emails show. Mr. Khanna stopped approving the transactions, he said, but another manager then began approving them.Mr. Khanna wrote to Abbott\u2019s ethics office in December 2013, laying out his concern that government purchasing rules were being violated. He said, \u201cI am afraid if I will continue to resist these unethical practices anymore I may get transferred or may lose my job.\u201dOn July 25, 2014, he says Abbott asked him to resign and accused him of a conflict of interest involving his wife. She had obtained a license the previous year to operate a wholesale drug business in case he left Abbott, where he felt increasingly insecure. Mr. Khanna said that opening a drug company would have violated Abbott\u2019s rules but that his wife had not started a company.He says he refused to resign. Abbott fired him.Asked about Mr. Khanna\u2019s allegations, Mr. Kadkol cited the company\u2019s policy of not discussing individual cases or investigations into internal complaints.Sitting on the floor of her tiny living room just days after her husband\u2019s suicide, Ms. Awasthi recounted the final few weeks of her husband\u2019s life.\u201cHe told me, \u2018The company is pressuring me,\u2019\u201d she said, wearing a pink sari, her two young children playing among the mourners. \u201cI said, \u2018Change jobs.\u2019 He said, \u2018How will I get another job?\u2019\u201dWork pressure built quickly in June after the new boss, Inder Kumar, took over managing Mr. Awasthi\u2019s sales team. His previous manager, Mr. Tiwari, had been asked to transfer to a city in southern India, more than 1,000 miles away from Indore. He declined the transfer and lost his job.According to two former employees of the new manager, he could be a tough boss. One of them, Mayank Pandey, said he felt so desperate to meet sales targets that he bribed doctors with his own cash to get them to prescribe Abbott drugs. Mr. Pandey quit Abbott this year, describing himself as \u201cmentally broken.\u201dMr. Kumar declined requests for interviews, referring questions to Mr. Kadkol, Abbott India\u2019s public affairs director, who cited the company\u2019s policy not to comment on individual employees.In general, Mr. Kadkol said, \u201cretaliatory or denigrating behavior of any kind is not accepted\u201d at Abbott, which encourages an environment \u201cdevoid of any harassment or undue pressure.\u201d He said any suggestion that Mr. Awasthi \u201cwas singled out for poor performance is without merit.\u201dMs. Awasthi said Mr. Kumar had summoned her husband to a Monday meeting. The day before, she says, Mr. Awasthi was unusually quiet. He swept their apartment, bathed both of the children and fed them. Then he napped by his wife\u2019s side.

{"Headline": "How Clinton Could Knock Trump Out", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMaybe I just missed it. But in all the testimonials at the Democratic convention about what Hillary Clinton has done for other people, I don\u2019t recall anyone saying, \u201cI started a business because of Hillary Clinton.\u201d Or, \u201cI hired someone because of Hillary Clinton.\u201dWe heard from first responders, veterans, grieving parents and victims of terrorism, rape and various forms of discrimination. There was just one group that was conspicuously absent: the people who drive our economy by inventing things or by borrowing money to start companies that actually employ people.Watching the convention, you would never know that what also makes America great is that generation after generation, people full of ideas risk their savings to start companies that provide work and paychecks. And only by generating more of these risk-takers will more people get hired for the good jobs Clinton promised.The only things that were remotely growth-related in her speech were glancing references to a government-led infrastructure investment program (Go for it!) and her vow \u201cto give small businesses a boost. Make it easier to get credit.\u201dTo do that, though, would run smack into the anti-bank sentiment of the Democratic Party, since small community banks provide about half the loans to small businesses, and it is precisely those banks that have been most choked by the post-2008 regulations. We need to prevent recklessness, not risk-taking.I raise this for two reasons. The first: Donald Trump may not stay stupid forever (although he might!), and therefore Hillary will have to beat him on the central economic issue of growth. Trump spent the past few days trashing the parents of a heroic Muslim American soldier who lost his life in Iraq. The parents had \u2014 rightly \u2014 criticized Trump. But in his return fire, Trump shot himself in both feet, losing support in his own party.Mind you, I hope Trump remains in his total whack-job mode, because it distracted attention from the latest economic news \u2014 that was perfectly set up for Trump to take political advantage of \u2014 that the economy grew an anemic 1.2 percent in the second quarter, and growth in the first quarter was revised downward. That economic news was teed up for Trump, the self-styled job-creator, and he shanked it deep into the woods, for it never to be heard from again.Trump has gone amazingly far without having done an ounce of homework in preparation for the presidency, relying instead on feeding tweets to an anxious G.O.P. base. His candidacy should be over by now. But it isn\u2019t.It scares me that people are so fed up with elites, so hate and mistrust Clinton and are so worried about the future \u2014 jobs, globalization and terrorism \u2014 that a bare majority could still fall for this self-infatuated carnival barker if he exhibited half a political brain.And that leads to my second reason for pushing Clinton to inject some capitalism into her economic plan: The coalition she could lead. If there is one thing that is not going to revive growth right now, it is an anti-trade, regulatory heavy, socialist-lite agenda the Democratic Party has drifted to under the sway of Bernie Sanders. Socialism is the greatest system ever invented for making people equally poor. Capitalism makes people unequally rich, but I would much rather grow our pie bigger and faster and better adjust the slices than redivide a shrinking one.There are a lot of center-right, business Republicans today feeling orphaned by Trump. They can\u2019t vote for him \u2014 but a lot of them still claim they can\u2019t bring themselves to vote for Hillary, either. Clinton should be reaching out to them with a real pro-growth, start-up, deregulation, entrepreneurship agenda and give them a positive reason to vote for her.It makes sense politically: Take Trump on at his self-proclaimed strength. And it makes sense economically: If Clinton wins, she will need to get stuff done, not just give stuff away.I get that she had to lean toward Sanders and his voters to win the nomination; their concerns with fairness and inequality are honorable. But those concerns can be addressed only with economic growth; the rising anti-immigration sentiments in the country can be defused only with economic growth; the general anxiety feeding Trumpism can be eased only with economic growth.Sanders had no plan whatsoever for growth. Trump doesn\u2019t, either, but he can fake it. It\u2019s time that Hillary pivoted. The country today doesn\u2019t need the first female president. It needs the first president in a long time who can govern with a center-left, center-right coalition, and actually end the gridlock on fiscal policy in a smart way.If Trump continues to melt down into a puddle of bile, more and more Republicans will be up for grabs. With the right pro-growth economic policies, Clinton would have an opening to not only enlist them to help her win, but to build a governing coalition for the morning after.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fractured Lands: How the Arab World Came Apart", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "TKThis is a story unlike any we have previously published. It is much longer than the typical New York Times Magazine feature story; in print, it occupies an entire issue. The product of some 18 months of reporting, it tells the story of the catastrophe that has fractured the Arab world since the invasion of Iraq 13 years ago, leading to the rise of ISIS and the global refugee crisis. The geography of this catastrophe is broad and its causes are many, but its consequences \u2014 war and uncertainty throughout the world \u2014 are familiar to us all. Scott Anderson\u2019s story gives the reader a visceral sense of how it all unfolded, through the eyes of six characters in Egypt, Libya, Syria, Iraq and Iraqi Kurdistan. Accompanying Anderson\u2019s text are 10 portfolios by the photographer Paolo Pellegrin, drawn from his extensive travels across the region over the last 14 years, as well as a landmark virtual-reality experience that embeds the viewer with the Iraqi fighting forces during the battle to retake Falluja.It is unprecedented for us to focus so much energy and attention on a single story, and to ask our readers to do the same. We would not do so were we not convinced that what follows is one of the most clear-eyed, powerful and human explanations of what has gone wrong in this region that you will ever read.\u2013 JAKE SILVERSTEIN, EDITOR IN CHIEFWe\u2019re saving your reading progress so you can pick up where you left off later.Our destination that day in May 2015 was the place of Azar\u2019s greatest sorrow, one that haunted him still. The previous year, ISIS gunmen had cut a murderous swath through northern Iraq, brushing away an Iraqi Army vastly greater in size, and then turning their attention to the Kurds. Azar had divined precisely where the ISIS killers were about to strike, knew that tens of thousands of civilians stood helpless in their path, but had been unable to get anyone to heed his warnings. In desperation, he had loaded up his car with guns and raced to the scene, only to come to a spot in the road where he saw he was just hours too late. \u201cIt was obvious,\u201d Azar said, \u201cso obvious. But no one wanted to listen.\u201d On that day, we were returning to the place where the fabled Kurdish warriors of northern Iraq had been outmaneuvered and put to flight, where Dr. Azar Mirkhan had failed to avert a colossal tragedy \u2014 and where, for many more months to come, he would continue to battle ISIS.Azar is a practicing urologist, but even without the firepower and warrior get-up, the 41-year-old would exude the aura of a hunter. He walks with a curious loping gait that produces little sound, and in conversation has a tendency to tuck his chin and stare from beneath heavy-lidded eyes, rather as if he were sighting down a gun. With his prominent nose and jet black pompadour, he bears a passing resemblance to a young Johnny Cash.The weaponry also complemented the doctor\u2019s personal philosophy, as expressed in a scene from one of his favorite movies, \u201cThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly,\u201d when a bathing Eli Wallach is caught off guard by a man seeking to kill him. Rather than immediately shoot Wallach, the would-be assassin goes into a triumphant soliloquy, allowing Wallach to kill him first.\u201cWhen you have to shoot, shoot; don\u2019t talk,\u201d Azar quoted from the movie. \u201cThat is us Kurds now. This is not the time to talk, but to shoot.\u201dFor each of these six people, the upheavals were crystallized by a specific, singular event. For Azar Mirkhan, it came on the road to Sinjar, when he saw that his worst fears had come true. For Laila Soueif in Egypt, it came when a young man separated from a sprinting mass of protesters to embrace her, and she thought she knew the revolution would succeed. For Majdi el-Mangoush in Libya, it came as he walked across a deadly no-man\u2019s-land and, overwhelmed by a sudden euphoria, felt free for the first time in his life. For Khulood al-Zaidi in Iraq, it came when, with just a few menacing words from a former friend, she finally understood that everything she had worked for was gone. For Majd Ibrahim in Syria, it came when, watching an interrogator search his cellphone for the identity of his \u201ccontroller,\u201d he knew his own execution was drawing nearer by the moment. For Wakaz Hassan in Iraq, a young man with no apparent interest in politics or religion, it came on the day ISIS gunmen showed up in his village and offered him a choice.As disparate as those moments were, for each of these six people they represented a crossing over, passage to a place from which there will never be a return. Such changes, of course \u2014 multiplied by millions of lives \u2014 are also transforming their homelands, the greater Middle East and, by inevitable extension, the entire world.As a writer with long experience in the Middle East, I initially welcomed the convulsions of the Arab Spring \u2014 indeed, I believed they were long overdue. In the early 1970s, I traveled through the region as a young boy with my father, a journey that sparked both my fascination with Islam and my love of the desert. The Middle East was also the site of my first foray into journalism when, in the summer of 1983, I hopped on a plane to the embattled city Beirut in hopes of finding work as a stringer. Over the subsequent years, I embedded with a platoon of Israeli commandos conducting raids in the West Bank; dined with Janjaweed raiders in Darfur; interviewed the families of suicide bombers. Ultimately, I took a five-year hiatus from magazine journalism to write a book on the historical origins of the modern Middle East.Experience firsthand the battles Iraqi forces endured to retake the city of Falluja from ISIS.Text yourself a link to get the NYT VR app.Please enter a 10-digit US mobile number.For iOS and Android.

Your information is used only to deliver a one-time text message.In my professional travels over the decades, I had found no other region to rival the Arab world in its utter stagnation. While Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya set a record for longevity in the Middle East with his 42-year dictatorship, it was not that different elsewhere; by 2011, any Egyptian younger than 41 \u2014 and that was roughly 75 percent of the population \u2014 had only ever known two heads of state, while a Syrian of the same age had lived his or her entire life under the control of the father-and-son Assad dynasty. Along with political stasis, in many Arab nations most levers of economic power lay in the hands of small oligarchies or aristocratic families; for everyone else, about the only path to financial security was to wrangle a job within fantastically bloated public-sector bureaucracies, government agencies that were often themselves monuments to nepotism and corruption. While the sheer amount of money pouring into oil-rich, sparsely populated nations like Libya or Kuwait might allow for a degree of economic trickle-down prosperity, this was not the case in more populous but resource-poor nations like Egypt or Syria, where poverty and underemployment were severe and \u2014 given the ongoing regional population explosion \u2014 ever-worsening problems.I was heartened, in the Arab Spring\u2019s early days, by the focus of the people\u2019s wrath. One of the Arab world\u2019s most prominent and debilitating features, I had long felt, was a culture of grievance that was defined less by what people aspired to than by what they opposed. They were anti-Zionist, anti-West, anti-imperialist. For generations, the region\u2019s dictators had been adroit at channeling public frustration toward these external \u201cenemies\u201d and away from their own misrule. But with the Arab Spring, that old playbook suddenly didn\u2019t work anymore. Instead, and for the first time on such a mass scale, the people of the Middle East were directing their rage squarely at the regimes themselves.Then it all went horribly wrong. By the summer of 2012, two of the \u201cfreed\u201d nations \u2014 Libya and Yemen \u2014 were sliding into anarchy and factionalism, while the struggle against the Bashar al-Assad government in Syria had descended into vicious civil war. In Egypt the following summer, the nation\u2019s first democratically elected government was overthrown by the military, a coup cheered on by many of the same young activists who took to the streets to demand democracy two years earlier. The only truly bright spot among the Arab Spring nations was the place where it started, Tunisia, but even there, terrorist attacks and feuding politicians were a constant threat to a fragile government. Amid the chaos, the remnants of Osama bin Laden\u2019s old outfit, Al Qaeda, gained a new lease on life, resurrected the war in Iraq and then spawned an even more severe and murderous offshoot: the Islamic State, or ISIS.The scattershot nature of the Arab Spring makes it hard to provide a single answer. Some nations were radically transformed, even as others right next door were barely touched. Some of the nations in crisis were relatively wealthy (Libya), others crushingly poor (Yemen). Some countries with comparatively benign dictatorships (Tunisia) blew up along with some of the region\u2019s most brutal (Syria). The same range of political and economic disparity is seen in the nations that remained stable.Yet one pattern does emerge, and it is striking. While most of the 22 nations that make up the Arab world have been buffeted to some degree by the Arab Spring, the six most profoundly affected \u2014 Egypt, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen \u2014 are all republics, rather than monarchies. And of these six, the three that have disintegrated so completely as to raise doubt that they will ever again exist as functioning states \u2014 Iraq, Syria and Libya \u2014 are all members of that small list of Arab countries created by Western imperial powers in the early 20th century. In each, little thought was given to national coherence, and even less to tribal or sectarian divisions. Certainly, these same internal divisions exist in many of the region\u2019s other republics, as well as in its monarchies, but it would seem undeniable that those two factors operating in concert \u2014 the lack of an intrinsic sense of national identity joined to a form of government that supplanted the traditional organizing principle of society \u2014 left Iraq, Syria and Libya especially vulnerable when the storms of change descended.In fact, all but one of the six people profiled ahead are from these \u201cartificial states,\u201d and their individual stories are rooted in the larger story of how those nations came to be. The process began at the end of World War I, when two of the victorious allies, Britain and France, carved up the lands of the defeated Ottoman Empire between themselves as spoils of war. In Mesopotamia, the British joined together three largely autonomous Ottoman provinces and named it Iraq. The southernmost of these provinces was dominated by Shiite Arabs, the central by Sunni Arabs and the northernmost by non-Arab Kurds. To the west of Iraq, the European powers took the opposite approach, carving the vast lands of \u201cgreater Syria\u201d into smaller, more manageable parcels. Falling under French rule was the smaller rump state of Syria \u2014 essentially the nation that exists today \u2014 and the coastal enclave of Lebanon, while the British took Palestine and Transjordan, a swath of southern Syria that would eventually become Israel and Jordan. Coming a bit later to the game, in 1934, Italy joined the three ancient North African regions that it had wrested from the Ottomans in 1912 to form the colony of Libya.To maintain dominion over these fractious territories, the European powers adopted the same divide-and-conquer approach that served them so well in the colonization of sub-Saharan Africa. This consisted of empowering a local ethnic or religious minority to serve as their local administrators, confident that this minority would never rebel against their foreign overseers lest they be engulfed by the disenfranchised majority.This was only the most overt level of the Europeans\u2019 divide-and-conquer strategy, however, for just beneath the sectarian and regional divisions in these \u201cnations\u201d there lay extraordinarily complex tapestries of tribes and subtribes and clans, ancient social orders that remained the populations\u2019 principal source of identification and allegiance. Much as the United States Army and white settlers did with Indian tribes in the conquest of the American West, so the British and French and Italians proved adept at pitting these groups against one another, bestowing favors \u2014 weapons or food or sinecures \u2014 to one faction in return for fighting another. The great difference, of course, is that in the American West, the settlers stayed and the tribal system was essentially destroyed. In the Arab world, the Europeans eventually left, but the sectarian and tribal schisms they fueled remained.While today that image is remembered in the Arab world with resentment \u2014 the symbolism of this latest Western intervention in their region was quite inescapable \u2014 at the time it spurred something far more nuanced. For the first time in their lives, what Syrians and Libyans and other Arabs just as much as Iraqis saw was that a figure as seemingly immovable as Saddam Hussein could be cast aside, that the political and social paralysis that had so long held their collective lands might actually be broken. Not nearly so apparent was that these strongmen had actually exerted considerable energy to bind up their nations, and in their absence the ancient forces of tribalism and sectarianism would begin to exert their own centrifugal pull. Even less apparent was how these forces would both attract and repel the United States, damaging its power and prestige in the region to an extent from which it might never recover.At least one man saw this quite clearly. For much of 2002, the Bush administration had laid the groundwork for the Iraq invasion by accusing Saddam Hussein of pursuing a weapons-of-mass-destruction program and obliquely linking him to the Sept. 11 attacks. In October 2002, six months before Firdos Square, I had a long interview with Muammar el-Qaddafi, and I asked him who would benefit if the Iraq invasion actually occurred. The Libyan dictator had a habit of theatrically pondering before answering my questions, but his reply to that one was instantaneous. \u201cBin Laden,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no doubt about that. And Iraq could end up becoming the staging ground for Al Qaeda, because if the Saddam government collapses, it will be anarchy in Iraq. If that happens, actions against Americans will be considered jihad.\u201dBeginning in April 2015, the photographer Paolo Pellegrin and I embarked on a series of extended trips to the Middle East. Separately and as a writer-photographer team, we had covered an array of conflicts in the region over the previous 20 years, and our hope on this new set of journeys was to gain a greater understanding of the so-called Arab Spring and its generally grim aftermath. As the situation continued to deteriorate through 2015 and 2016, our travels expanded: to those islands in Greece bearing the brunt of the migrant exodus from Iraq and Syria; to the front lines in northern Iraq where the battle against ISIS was being most vigorously waged.We have presented the results of this 16-month project in the form of six individual narratives, which, woven within the larger strands of history, aim to provide a tapestry of an Arab World in revolt.The account is divided into five parts, which proceed chronologically as they alternate between our principal characters. Along with introducing several of these individuals, Part 1 focuses on three historical factors that are crucial to understanding the current crisis: the inherent instability of the Middle East\u2019s artificial states; the precarious position in which U.S.-allied Arab governments have found themselves when compelled to pursue policies bitterly opposed by their own people; and American involvement in the de facto partitioning of Iraq 25 years ago, an event little remarked upon at the time \u2014 and barely more so since \u2014 that helped call into question the very legitimacy of the modern Arab nation-state. Part 2 is primarily devoted to the American invasion of Iraq, and to how it laid the groundwork for the Arab Spring revolts. In Part 3, the narrative quickens, as we follow the explosive outcome of those revolts as they occurred in Egypt, Libya and Syria. By Part 4, which chronicles the rise of ISIS, and Part 5, which tracks the resulting exodus from the region, we are squarely in the present, at the heart of the world\u2019s gravest concern.I have tried to tell a human story, one that has its share of heroes, even some glimmers of hope. But what follows, ultimately, is a dark warning. Today the tragedy and violence of the Middle East have spilled from its banks, with nearly a million Syrians and Iraqis flooding into Europe to escape the wars in their homelands, and terrorist attacks in Dhaka, Paris and beyond. With the ISIS cause being invoked by mass murderers in San Bernardino and Orlando, the issues of immigration and terrorism have now become conjoined in many Americans\u2019 minds, forming a key political flash point in the coming presidential election. In some sense, it is fitting that the crisis of the Arab world has its roots in the First World War, for like that war, it is a regional crisis that has come quickly and widely \u2014 with little seeming reason or logic \u2014 to influence events at every corner of the globe.Laila Soueif at home in Cairo, June 2016.Wakaz Hassan outside Kirkuk, Iraq, December 2015.Azar Mirkhan in the Sinjar region, Iraq, November 2015.Majd Ibrahim in Dresden, Germany, November 2015.\u00a0Khulood al-Zaidi in Amman, Jordan, May 2015.Majdi el-Mangoush in Misurata, Libya, March 2016.\u00a0TKEgyptSee MapLaila was born into a life of both privilege and intellectual freedom. Her parents were college professors, and her older sister, Ahdaf Soueif, is one of Egypt\u2019s best-known contemporary novelists. She gravitated toward leftist politics at an early age. While studying mathematics at Cairo University in the mid-1970s, she met her future husband, Ahmed Seif, who was already the leader of an underground communist student cell calling for revolution.By then, Egypt had long been regarded as the political capital of the Middle East, the birthplace of revolutionary movements and ideas. In the modern era, it owed that status largely to the legacy of one man: Gamal Abdel Nasser.Well into the 1940s, Egypt, along with most of the rest of the Middle East, remained a lesser global concern, still in the thrall of the European powers that imposed their will on the area decades before. That began to change at the end of World War II with the discovery of vast new oil fields in the region, and with the collapse of the British and French colonial empires. The pace of change greatly accelerated when Nasser and his Free Officers Movement of junior military officers overthrew Egypt\u2019s Western-pliant king in 1952.Championing \u201cArab socialism\u201d and Pan-Arab unity, Nasser swiftly became a galvanizing figure throughout the Arab world, the spokesman for a people long dominated by foreigners and Western-educated elites. Just as crucial to the strongman\u2019s popularity was what he opposed: colonialism, imperialism and that most immediate and enduring example of the West\u2019s meddling in the region, the state of Israel.Nasser\u2019s success inspired many other would-be Arab leaders, nowhere more so than in the artificial states of the Middle East formed by the European powers. By 1968, military officers espousing the Baathist (\u201crenaissance\u201d) philosophy \u2014 a quasi-socialist form of Pan-Arabism \u2014 had seized power in Iraq and Syria. They were joined the following year by the Libyan lieutenant Muammar el-Qaddafi, and his somewhat-baffling \u201cthird universal theory,\u201d which rejected traditional democracy in favor of rule by \u201cpeople\u2019s committees.\u201d In all three countries, just as in Egypt, Western-favored monarchs or Parliaments were neutered or cast aside.But Nasser possessed an advantage that his fellow autocrats in the region did not. With a sense of national identity that stretched back millenniums, Egypt never seemed in danger of being torn apart; the centrifugal pull of tribes or clans or sectarian identity simply didn\u2019t exist there to the degree it did in Syria or Iraq. At the same time, Egypt\u2019s long tradition of relative liberalism had given rise to a fractious political landscape that ran the spectrum from secular communists to fundamentalist Islamists.Part of Nasser\u2019s genius was his ability to bridge these divides, and he did so by appealing both to Egyptian national pride and to a shared antipathy for the West, a vestige, perhaps, of 70 years of heavy-handed rule by Britain. Thus, even when Islamist conservatives became alarmed by Nas\u00adser\u2019s moves toward greater secularism, most still saw him as a hero for nationalizing Western businesses, and for besting Britain, France and Israel in the 1956 Suez crisis. Similarly, urban liberals like the Soueif family who disdained Nasser\u2019s strong-arm rule \u2014 his was a military dictatorship, after all \u2014 also cheered him for his leadership in the international Nonaligned Movement, for proudly thumbing his nose at the threats and enticements of the United States as it sought to compel Egypt into its orbit during the Cold War. This became the means by which Nasser and his successor, Anwar Sadat, maintained their grip on power: play left and right off each other as a matter of course; bring them together when needed by focusing on an external foe. Such maneuvering resulted in many odd political turns, including the first protest march of Laila Soueif.After working on leftist causes together throughout their time at the University of Cairo, Laila and Ahmed married in 1978. That same year, Egypt\u2019s political landscape was neatly turned upside down. In September, Sadat signed the Camp David accords, which led to an American-brokered peace treaty with Israel. That stunning about-face simultaneously propelled Egypt into the camp of American client-states and isolated it from much of the rest of the Arab world. Even more ominously for Sadat, what was seen in the West as an act of courage was regarded by most Egyptians as an act of betrayal and national shame. This was certainly the view of Laila and Ahmed. It was in the wake of the 1979 peace treaty that some of the men in Ahmed\u2019s underground cell began buying up arms on the black market and vowing armed action against the government. Those plans never got off the ground, though. Instead, it was a cabal of Islam\u00adist military plotters who finally got to Sadat, shooting and killing him at a military parade in Cairo in October 1981.A month later, Laila gave birth to her and Ahmed\u2019s first child, a boy they named Alaa. Their lives took on an air of increasingly apolitical domesticity, and by 1983, Laila, then 28, was juggling the demands of child-rearing with her new position as a professor of mathematics at Cairo University. All normalcy was shattered, however, when Sadat\u2019s successor, Hosni Mubarak, ordered a sweeping security crackdown. Among those ensnared in the dragnet were Ahmed and his colleagues in the underground cell. Severely tortured until he signed a full confession, Ahmed was then released to await his verdict. When that verdict was returned, in late 1984, the news was grim: Ahmed was found guilty of illegal weapons possession and sentenced to five years in prison.At the time, Laila was in France, having accepted a scholarship to further her math studies, but when Ahmed\u2019s sentence was handed down, she rushed back to Cairo with Alaa. Thanks to a curious loophole in Egyptian law, sentences for security-related offenses like Ahmed\u2019s had to be approved by the president, a process that normally took several months and during which the defendant could remain out on bail. It presented the couple with a tempting choice.\u201cWe had to decide,\u201d Laila, who is now 60, told me. \u201cDoes he submit and go into prison for five years, do we try to find some way to get him out of the country or do we go into hiding?\u201d She gave a nonchalant shrug. \u201cSo we went into hiding.\u201dFor several months, the couple lived as fugitives with their 3-year-old son. Ultimately, though, both realized it was a futile exercise. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t willing to leave the country,\u201d Laila said, \u201cand he couldn\u2019t stay in hiding forever. He decided it was easier to do the five years, so he gave himself up.\u201d But not necessarily easier for Laila. She became pregnant during her and Ahmed\u2019s brief time on the run, leaving her to tend to a second child, a girl they named Mona, as Ahmed served out his prison sentence.It was in prison that Ahmed experienced something of an epiphany. By continuing the entente with the United States and Israel that Sadat had begun, Mubarak naturally also inherited the taint of capitulation in the eyes of many of his countrymen. Unable to forge national cohesion by turning to the old external enemy card \u2014 after all, Egypt was now in bed with those supposed enemies \u2014 Mubarak had devised a more carefully calibrated system to play his secular leftist and militant Islamist oppositions against each other. Ahmed, thrown into prison with both factions, saw firsthand how this strategy played out when it came to even the most basic of human rights. As he would later tell Joe Stork of Human Rights Watch, \u201cThe communists would say secretly, \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter if Islamists are tortured.\u2019 And the Islamists would say, \u2018Why not torture communists?\u2019 \u201dDetermined to fight for judicial reform, Ahmed devoted himself to studying law in his prison cell. Within a month of his release in 1989, he was admitted to the Egyptian bar.This placed the ex-political prisoner and his wife at a crossroads. With Laila a tenured professor at Cairo University and Ahmed now a lawyer, the couple had the opportunity to carve out a comfortable existence for themselves among the Cairene elite. Instead, and at ultimately great personal cost, they would plunge ever deeper into Egypt\u2019s widening turmoils, trying to cross the very divides that had for so long been critical to the government's own survival.LibyaSee MapOver time, however, Qaddafi\u2019s rule increasingly bore less resemblance to Egypt\u2019s \u201csoft\u201d dictatorship and more to that of two others influenced by the Nasser model: the Baathist regimes of Saddam Hussein in Iraq and Hafez al-Assad in Syria. The parallels were quite striking. In all three countries, the dictators developed elaborate personality cults \u2014 their faces adorned posters and murals and postage stamps \u2014 and aligned themselves with the \u201canti-imperialist\u201d bloc of Arab nations, their stances helped along by deepening ties with the Soviet Union. True to the Baathist credo of \u201cArab socialism\u201d and Qaddafi\u2019s third universal theory, all three countries embarked on fabulously ambitious public works projects, building hospitals and schools and colleges throughout their lands and bankrolling those enterprises with oil receipts (in the cases of Libya and Iraq), or through the patronage of the Soviet Union (in the case of Syria). At the same time, the states established extravagantly bloated governmental structures, such that their ministries and agencies quickly became the main pillars of the economy; eventually more than half of the Libyan work force \u2014 Majdi el-Mangoush\u2019s parents among them \u2014 was on the government payroll, and the figures in Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq were similar. \u201cEverybody was connected to the state somehow,\u201d Majdi explained. \u201cFor their housing, for their job. It was impossible to exist outside of it.\u201dFor all their revolutionary rhetoric, the dictators of Libya, Iraq and Syria remained ever mindful that their nations were essentially artificial constructs. What this meant was that many of their subjects\u2019 primary loyalty lay not to the state but to their tribe or, more broadly, to their ethnic group or religious sect. To keep them loyal required both the carrot and the stick. In all three nations, the leaders entered into elaborate and labyrinthine alliances with various tribes and clans. Stay on the dictator\u2019s good side, and your tribe might be given control of a ministry or a lucrative business concession; fall on his bad side, and you\u2019re all out in the cold. The strongmen also carefully forged ties across ethnic and religious divides. In Iraq, even though most all senior Baathist officials were, like Saddam Hussein, of the Sunni minority, he endeavored to sprinkle just enough Shiites and Kurds through his administration to lend it an ecumenical sheen. In Hafez al-Assad\u2019s Sunni-majority Syria, rule by his Alawite minority was augmented by a de facto alliance with the nation\u2019s Christian community, giving another significant minority a stake in the status quo.This coalition-building had a unique geographic dimension in Libya. Aside from the historical rivalry that existed between the principal regions, Tripolitania and Cyrenaica, human settlement in Libya had always been clustered along the Mediterranean coast, and what developed there over the millenniums was essentially a series of semiautonomous city-states that resisted central rule. Thus, while Qaddafi didn\u2019t need to worry about religious sectarianism \u2014 virtually all Libyans are Sunni Muslims \u2014 he did need to think about drawing into his ruling circle the requisite number of Misuratans and Benghazians to keep everyone mollified.The state also had a very long memory, as Majdi el-Mangoush discovered growing up in Misurata. In 1975, two of his mother\u2019s relatives, both midlevel army officers, joined in a failed coup attempt against Qaddafi. While both were executed, that didn\u2019t remove the stain on the family name. (Testament to the enduring tribal nature of Libya, Majdi\u2019s mother was also of the Mangoush clan.)\u201cIt\u2019s not that we were directly persecuted because of it,\u201d Majdi, who is now 30, explained, \u201cbut it was something officials would always comment on: \u2018Ah, so you\u2019re a Mangoush.\u2019 It meant the government watched you a little closer, that you were never viewed as completely trustworthy.\u201dBut a perverse dynamic often takes hold in strongman dictators \u2014 and here, too, there were great similarities among Qaddafi, Hussein and Assad. Part of it stems from what might be called the naked-emperor syndrome, whereby, in the constant company of sycophants, the leader gradually becomes unmoored from reality. Another is rooted in the very nature of a police state. The greater the repression of security forces, the further that any true dissent burrows underground, making it that much harder for a dictator to know where his actual enemies are; this fuels a deepening state of paranoia, which can be assuaged only through even greater repression. By the 1990s, this cycle had produced a bizarre contradiction in Iraq, Syria and Libya: The more the leaders promoted a cult of hero worship and wallpapered their nations with their likenesses, the more reclusive those leaders became. In Majdi el-Mangoush\u2019s case, despite living in a country whose total population was less than that of New York\u2019s five boroughs, not once in 25 years did he ever personally glimpse Qaddafi. This was about the same number of times he uttered the dictator\u2019s name in a disparaging way in public. \u201cYou would only do that with family, or with the most trusted of friends,\u201d Majdi explained. \u201cIf you were around others and wanted to say something at all critical, it was \u2018our friend.\u2019 \u201dThere was another notable aspect to the posters and murals and mosaics of the dictators that could be seen everywhere in Libya, Iraq and Syria. In a great many of them, framing the image of the strongman, there appeared the outline of the country\u2019s borders. Perhaps that juxtaposition was designed to impart a simple message \u2014 \u201cI am the leader of the nation\u201d \u2014 but it\u2019s possible that the artificial-state dictators were also sending a message that was both more ambitious and more admonishing: \u201cI am the nation; and if I go, then so goes the nation.\u201d Of course, that may have been just what many members of the Mangoush clan \u2014 celebrated enough to have their own namesake neighborhood, notorious enough to be permanently marked \u2014 were secretly hoping.Tripoli, October 2002.Tripoli, October 2002.Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Tripoli, October 2002.Tripoli, October 2002.Tripoli, October 2002.KurdistanSee Map\u201cThe treaty was signed on the 6th of March,\u201d Azar Mirkhan, who is now 41, explained, \u201cand I was born on the 7th. My mother gave birth to me on the road, on the border between Iran and Iraq.\u201d He gave a rueful little laugh. \u201cThat is why my family has always called me \u2018the lucky child.\u2019 Kurdish luck.\u201dIndeed, it is hard to find any people quite as unlucky as the Kurds. Spread across the mountainous reaches of four nations \u2014 Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey \u2014 they have always regarded themselves as culturally apart from their neighbors and have constantly battled for independence from those nations they inhabit. The governments of these nations have tended to view their reluctant Kurdish subjects with both fear and distrust, and have taken turns quashing their bids for independence. Those governments have also periodically employed the Kurds \u2014 either their own or those of their neighbors \u2014 as proxy fighters to attack or unsettle their regional enemies-of-the-day. Historically, when those feuds were brought to an end, so, too, was the Kurds\u2019 usefulness, and they were soon abandoned \u2014 as occurred in the 1975 \u201cgreat betrayal.\u201dWhile the number of rebellions and proxy wars that have occurred across the breadth of Kurdistan over the past century is almost impossible to count, the biography of Heso Mirkhan\u2019s commander, Mustafa Barzani, provides something of a gauge. By the time of his death in 1979, the 75-year-old Barzani had not only waged war against Turkey, Iran (twice) and the central government of Iraq (four times), but had somehow found the energy to also take it to the Ottomans and the British and a host of Kurdish rivals. Multiply Barzani\u2019s list by four \u2014 the Kurds of Syria, Iran and Turkey have each had their own competing guerrilla groups and independence movements \u2014 and it all becomes a bit staggering.Despite the fears of these governments that they might some day be confronted by an independent \u201cgreater Kurdistan,\u201d the truth is that the differences among the Kurds in these four countries now rival their similarities. One thing they have in common, though, is a longstanding warrior tradition, and among the Kurds of northern Iraq, there is no more celebrated family of pesh merga \u2014 literally translated as \u201cthose who face death\u201d \u2014 than the Mirkhans.Following their father, Dr. Azar Mirkhan and four of his nine brothers have undergone pesh merga training; today, one brother, Araz, is a senior pesh merga commander on the front lines. But the family has paid a high price for membership in the warrior caste. Heso, the patriarch, was killed in combat in 1983, while one of Azar\u2019s older brothers, Ali, met the same end in 1994.But it hasn\u2019t been just the region\u2019s governments that have historically victimized the Kurds. In fact, few nations have brought the Kurds of northern Iraq more sorrow than the United States. After their role in the great betrayal of 1975, the Americans would again be complicit in the Kurds\u2019 suffering \u2014 if this time largely through silence \u2014 just 10 years later.By then, the United States\u2019 chief ally in the region, the shah of Iran, had been overthrown and replaced by the hostile Shiite fundamentalist government of Ayatollah Khomeini. Searching for a new partner in the region, Washington found one in Saddam Hussein. With the Iraqi dictator waging war against Khomeini\u2019s Iran, and with the United States secretly funneling weapons to his bogged-down military, by 1988 Hussein was so integral to the Reagan administration\u2019s realpolitik policy in the region that it simply looked the other way when Hussein launched the murderous Anfal campaign against his Kurdish subjects. A squalid new low was reached in March of that year, when Iraqi forces poison-gassed the Kurdish town Halabja, killing an estimated 5,000 people. Despite overwhelming evidence that Hussein was responsible for the atrocity \u2014 Halabja would figure prominently in his 2006 trial for crimes against humanity \u2014 Reagan-administration officials scurried to suggest it was actually the handiwork of Iran.What finally ended the American arrangement with Saddam Hussein was the Iraqi despot\u2019s 1990 decision to invade neighboring Kuwait, upsetting not just the Western powers but also most of his Arab neighbors. Perversely, that event very nearly led to yet another slaughter of Iraq\u2019s Kurds. Instead, it would eventually lead to their liberation, as well as mark the crucial moment when the United States propelled itself headlong into Iraq\u2019s sectarian and ethnic divides.In the face of Hussein\u2019s belligerence, President George H.W. Bush marshaled an international military coalition \u2014 Operation Desert Storm \u2014 that swiftly annihilated the Iraqi Army in Kuwait, then rolled into Iraq itself. With Hussein\u2019s government appearing on the verge of collapse, Bush encouraged the Iraqi people to rise up in revolt. Both of Iraq\u2019s marginalized communities \u2014 the Shiites in the south and the Kurds in the north \u2014 eagerly did so, only to see the United States suddenly take pause. Belatedly concluding that Hussein\u2019s demise might play into the hands of a still-hostile Iran, the Bush administration ordered American troops to stand down as the Iraqi Army regrouped and began a pitiless counterattack.To forestall a wholesale massacre of the rebels they had encouraged, the United States joined its allies in establishing a protected buffer zone in Kurdistan, as well as no-fly zones in both northern and southern Iraq. That still left Sad\u00addam Hussein in Baghdad, of course, and ready to take his revenge at the first opportunity. While the Bush administration concluded there was little it could do to aid the geographically isolated Shiites in the south \u2014 they soon suffered their own Anfal-style pogrom \u2014 to protect the Kurds, they forced Hussein to militarily withdraw from all of Kurdistan. Taking matters a step further, in July 1992 the Kurdistan Regional Government, an autonomous union of Iraq\u2019s three Kurdish provinces, was established.The Bush administration most likely regarded this Kurdish separation as a stopgap measure, to be undone once the tyrant in Baghdad had gone and the danger had passed. The long-suffering Kurds of Iraq saw it very differently. For the first time since 1919, they were free from the yoke of Baghdad, and they had their own nation in all but name. While very few in the West appreciated the significance at the time, the creation of the Kurdistan Regional Government, or K.R.G., marked the first dismantling of the colonial borders that were imposed on the region 75 years earlier, the de facto partition of one of the Middle East\u2019s artificial nations. In the years just ahead, tens of thousands of members of the Iraqi Kurdish diaspora would abandon their places of exile to return to their old homeland. In 1994, that included a 19-year-old college student, Azar Mirkhan, who had spent almost his entire life as a refugee in Iran.SyriaSee MapYet, until its demise, Homs had the distinction of being the most religiously diverse city in one of the most religiously mixed countries in the Arab world. Nationally, Syria is composed of about 70 percent Arab Sunni Muslims, 12 percent Alawites \u2014 an offshoot of Shia Islam \u2014 and a roughly equal percentage of Sunni Kurds; Christians and a number of smaller religious sects make up the rest. At the geographic crossroads of Syria, Homs reflected this ecumenical confluence, with a skyline punctuated not just by the minarets of mosques but also by the steeples of Catholic churches and the domes of Orthodox Christian ones.This gave Homs a cosmopolitan flavor not readily found elsewhere \u2014 so much so that in 1997, the Ibrahims, a Sunni couple, thought nothing of putting their first child, 5-year-old Majd, in a private Catholic school. As a result, Majd grew up with mostly Christian friends and a better knowledge of Jesus and the Bible than of Muhammad and the Quran. This didn\u2019t appear to bother Majd\u2019s parents at all. Although raised as Muslims, both were of the nominal variety, with his mother rarely even bothering to wear a head scarf in public and his father dragging himself to the mosque only for funerals.Such secular liberalism was very much in keeping with the new Syria that Hafez al-Assad sought to shape during his otherwise typically iron-fisted 30-year dictatorship, a secularism undoubtedly encouraged by his own religious minority status as an Alawite. After his death in 2000, the policy was carried on by his son, Bashar. A bland and socially awkward London-trained ophthalmologist, Bashar came to power largely by default \u2014 the Assad patriarch had been grooming his eldest son, Bassel, to take over until a fatal car accident in 1994. But Bashar, while projecting a softer, more modern face of Baathism to the outside world, also proved adroit at navigating the tricky currents of Middle Eastern politics. While still publicly vowing to recover the Golan Heights taken by Israel in the Six-Day War, he maintained an uneasy d\u00e9tente with Tel Aviv, even pursuing secret negotiations toward a settlement. By gradually loosening Syria\u2019s hold on neighboring Lebanon \u2014 its troops had occupied portions of the country since 1976, and Damascus was a prime supporter of Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah militia \u2014 the younger Assad was viewed increasingly favorably by the West.And to a young Majd Ibrahim then coming of age, it increasingly appeared that it was the West where his nation\u2019s future lay. Like other middle-class boys in Homs, he wore Western clothes, listened to Western music, watched Western videos, but Majd was also afforded a unique window onto the outside world. His father, an electrical engineer, worked at one of the best hotels in Homs, the Safir, and Majd \u2014 fascinated by the hotel, with its constant bustle of travelers \u2014 made any excuse to visit him as he went about his day. For Majd, the Safir was also a place of reassurance, a reminder that no matter what small deviations Syrian politics took along the way, he would always be able to inhabit the modern and secular world into which he was born.TKIraqSee MapYet, in the peculiar way that ambition can take root in the most inhospitable of settings, Khulood had always been determined to escape the confines of Kut, and she focused her energies on the one path that might allow for it: higher education. In this, she had an ally of sorts in her father. Ali al-Zaidi was insistent that all his children, including his three daughters, obtain college degrees, even if the ultimate purpose of the girls\u2019 education bordered on the obscure.\u201cMy father was very progressive in a lot of ways,\u201d she explained, \u201cbut even with him, going to college was never about my having a professional career. Instead, it was always the idea of \u2018Study hard, get a degree, but then find a husband.\u2019 \u201d She shrugged. \u201cThis was the Iraqi system.\u201d Khulood pursued a degree in English literature at a local university, but the expectation was that, degree in hand, she might teach English at a local school for a few years, then marry and start a family. Khulood had different plans, though: With her English proficiency, she would go to Baghdad and look for work as an interpreter for one of the few foreign companies then operating in Iraq.That scheme was sidetracked when, just three months short of her graduation, the Americans invaded Iraq. In the early morning of April 3, 2003, the fighting reached Kut. Advance units of the United States First Marine Expeditionary Force encircled the city, and for the next several hours methodically destroyed one Iraqi redoubt after another, their tanks and artillery on the ground complemented by close air support. Of this battle for her hometown, Khulood, then 23, heard a great deal but saw nothing. There was a simple explanation for this. \u201cWomen weren\u2019t allowed out of the house,\u201d she said.Before the invasion, Vice President Dick Cheney predicted that Americans would be \u201cgreeted as liberators\u201d in Iraq, and his prediction was borne out in the streets of Kut on April 4. As the Marines consolidated their hold on the city, they were happily swarmed by young men and children proffering trays of sweets and hot tea. Finally permitted to leave her home, Khulood, like most other women in Kut, observed the spectacle from a discreet distance. \u201cThe Americans were very relaxed, friendly, but mostly I was struck by how huge they seemed \u2014 and all their weapons and vehicles, too. Everything seemed out of scale, like we had been invaded by aliens.\u201dWhile there continued to be sporadic fighting elsewhere by remnants of Saddam Hussein\u2019s Baathist government \u2014 given the Orwellian label of \u201canti-Iraqi forces\u201d by the Bush administration \u2014 the few coalition troops who remained in Kut that spring and early summer felt secure enough to mingle free of body armor with residents and to patrol its streets in unprotected trucks. Those soldiers also quickly returned the city to something close to normalcy. The university was reopened after just a two-month interruption, enabling Khulood to obtain her bachelor\u2019s degree that August. The real work now was in rebuilding the nation\u2019s shattered economy and reconstituting its government, and to that end a small army of foreign engineers, accountants and consultants descended on Iraq under the aegis of the Coalition Provisional Authority, or C.P.A., the American-led transitional administration that would stand down once a new Iraqi government was in place.One of those who came was a 33-year-old lawyer from Oklahoma named Fern Holland. A human rights adviser for the C.P.A., Holland had a special brief in the summer of 2003 that included developing projects to empower women in the Shiite heartland of southern Iraq. In September 2003, that mission took her to Kut and her first encounter with Khulood.\u201cI will always remember the first time I saw Fern,\u201d Khulood said. \u201cShe brought a group of us women together to talk about the work she wanted to do in Iraq. She was surprisingly young \u2014 this is easy to forget, because her personality was so strong \u2014 with bright blond hair and a very open, friendly manner. I had never met a woman like her. I don\u2019t think any of us in that room had.\u201dWhat Holland told the women in the Kut meeting hall was no less exotic to them than her appearance. With the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, she said, a new Iraq was being established, one in which democracy and respect for human rights would reign supreme. What\u2019s more, to consolidate this new Iraq, everyone had a role to play, not least the women of Kut.For Khulood, that talk struck with the force of epiphany. This was the moment she had been waiting for her entire life. Almost immediately, she began doing volunteer work on women\u2019s rights projects for Holland. \u201cI had thought about these issues before, but under Saddam Hussein they were like fantasies,\u201d Khulood said. \u201cNow, I saw a future for myself.\u201dHolland was perhaps less confident. From past experience working in conservative and male-dominated societies in Africa, she suspected that it would only be a matter of time \u2014 and probably a very short time \u2014 before the forces of tradition rose up in opposition to her work, so she had to set change in motion quickly. She also knew that, as an outsider, her role needed to be a limited one; what was required was dynamic local women to spearhead the effort, women like Khulood al-Zaidi.The following month, Holland chose Khulood to be a representative at a national women\u2019s leadership conference, held under the auspices of the C.P.A. At that conference, Khulood received even headier news: She had been selected as part of a women\u2019s delegation that would soon travel to Washington to help draft the new Iraqi Constitution. When word of this spread at the conference, it provoked a backlash. \u201cA lot of the other women objected because I was so young,\u201d Khulood said. \u201cEven I thought it was maybe too much. But Fern insisted. She told the other women, \u2018Khulood represents the youth of Iraq \u2014 she is going.\u2019 She was my biggest supporter.\u201dOn that November 2003 trip to Washington, the 23-year-old fresh out of college met with a parade of dignitaries, including President George W. Bush. Upon her return, she was formally hired by the C.P.A. to serve as an assistant manager of the Kut media office. It was a very long way for a young woman who, less than a year earlier, had imagined no greater future than finding interpreter work with a foreign company. \u201cIt was a very exciting time,\u201d Khulood said. \u201cBecause you could feel everything changing so fast.\u201dNear Basra, March 2003.A protest in Baghdad, April 2003.Near Basra, April 2003.Near Basra, April 2003.The fall of Basra, April 2003.American soldiers in Baghdad, April 2003.IraqSee MapOnly 8 years old in 2003, Wakaz seemed destined for an exceedingly normal life, even a prosaic one. The youngest of five children born to an Iraqi bank clerk and his wife, he spent his childhood in the drowsy farming community of Dawr, just 15 miles down the Tigris River from Saddam Hussein\u2019s hometown, Tikrit. \u201cAll was very good there,\u201d he recalled. \u201cEasy.\u201dThat changed with the American invasion. Long considered a Baathist stronghold by virtue of Hussein\u2019s origins there, Tikrit and its environs were a prime early objective of the invaders, with the city itself the target of intense aerial bombardments. By mid-April 2003, coalition troops occupied the string of gaudy palace buildings erected by Hussein along the Tikrit riverfront and began conducting raids through the surrounding river towns in search of fugitive Baathist officials. The May 15 raid on Dawr netted 30 suspected Baathists \u2014 a startling number for such a small commu\u00adnity \u2014 but the town was soon to yield up an even greater prize. In mid-December 2003, American troops discovered a \u201cspider hole\u201d on the northern edge of Dawr and pulled out Hussein himself.The young Wakaz had only the vaguest grasp of all this. According to him, his family \u2014 Sunni, like most all residents of the Tikrit area \u2014 was not particularly religious, nor was it political in any way. He remembered hearing something about the mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners at an American-operated prison \u2014 clearly a reference to the Abu Ghraib scandal \u2014 and then there was the time American soldiers searched his family\u2019s home, but those soldiers were quite respectful, and the episode passed without incident.\u201cI know others had problems with the Americans,\u201d Wakaz said, \u201cbut my family, no. For us, we were really not affected at all.\u201dWhat the Hassan family did blame the invaders for, at least in a general way, was the ensuing collapse of the Iraqi economy, a downturn that cost Wakaz\u2019s father his job at the Rafidain Bank. To support his young family, the Hassan patriarch used his savings to open a small sweet shop on Dawr\u2019s main street. \u201cSo yes, our life was definitely much easier before the Americans came,\u201d Wakaz conceded. \u201cEven if it wasn\u2019t their fault directly, that is when everything became much harder.\u201dIraqSee MapIn their Iraqi war plans, the Pentagon had set down comprehensive blueprints detailing which strategic installations and government ministries were to be seized and guarded. But the American military seemed to have given little thought to the arsenals and munitions depots that Hussein had scattered about the country. In one town and city after another, these storehouses were systematically looted, sometimes under the gaze of coalition soldiers who did not intervene.The occupying authorities soon compounded this misstep. In a move now largely regarded as calamitous, one of the first actions taken by the C.P.A.\u2019s administrator, Paul Bremer, was to disband the Iraqi military. Just like that, hundreds of thousands of men \u2014 men with both military training and access to weapons \u2014 were being put out of their jobs by the summer of 2003.It may have been the edict immediately preceding that decree, however, that had the most deleterious effect. Under the terms of C.P.A. Order No. 1, senior Baath Party members were summarily dismissed from government positions and placed under a lifetime public-employment ban. In addition, employees in the upper echelon of all government institutions were to be investigated for Baathist affiliations. As critics pointed out, tens of thousands of apolitical Iraqi professionals \u2014 a group that included Khulood\u2019s radiologist father, Ali al-Zaidi \u2014 were compelled to join the party in the 1990s as part of a \u201crecruitment drive\u201d by Saddam Hussein; now these teachers and doctors and engineers were at risk of being disenfranchised.The effects of Order 1 stretched far beyond the dismissed Baathists. In Iraq, as in much of the rest of the Middle East, government offices operated on an elaborate patronage system in which most every employee, from senior staff down to the steward who brought refreshments to visitors, owed their jobs to the head man; as might be expected, that man \u2014 almost invariably a Baath Party member during Saddam Hussein\u2019s reign \u2014 usually handed out those jobs to members of his extended family or tribe. What the firing of as many as 85,000 Baathists actually meant, then, was the cashiering of countless more people and the instant impoverishment of entire clans and tribes.Under the weight of these blunders, it\u2019s remarkable that the Iraqi occupation didn\u2019t blow up sooner. An omen of what was to come occurred in August 2003, when the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad was destroyed by a truck bomb, killing 22, including the U.N.\u2019s special representative for Iraq, Sergio Vieira de Mello. That was followed by a steady escalation in attacks against coalition forces. By the beginning of 2004, C.P.A. officials perceived a deepening hostility toward their initiatives, so much so that even Fern Holland began to worry. As she wrote in an email to a friend in late January: \u201cWe\u2019re doing all we can with the brief time we\u2019ve got left. It\u2019s a terrible race. Wish us luck. Wish the Iraqis luck.\u201dOn March 8, 2004, the new provisional Constitution of Iraq was signed. The clause that set a goal of having 25 percent of future parliamentary seats held by women was largely credited to the behind-the-scenes lobbying of Fern Holland.The following afternoon, a Daewoo containing three C.P.A. civilian employees was traveling along a provincial highway when an Iraqi police pickup truck pulled alongside. With a blast of automatic gunfire, the car was sent careering across the highway before stalling on the shoulder; the men in the police truck then clambered out to finish off their victims with assault rifles. All three of the Daewoo's occupants were killed in the fusillade, marking them as the first C.P.A. civilians to be murdered in Iraq. That included the driver and presumed target of the attack, Fern Holland.Following Holland\u2019s murder, a sense of trepidation spread among the thousands of C.P.A. personnel scattered across Iraq. \u201cWe were all in a state of shock, of course,\u201d Khulood al-Zaidi said, \u201cbut I think we were also waiting to see what it meant, if it had been an attack on Fern in particular or if this was going to be something larger.\u201dThe answer came very soon. In tandem with the growing Sunni insurgency in central Iraq, through the first months of 2004, a radical Shiite cleric in Baghdad, Moktada al-Sadr, had been demanding a withdrawal of all coalition forces from the nation. In early April, Sadr unleashed his militia, the Mahdi Army, in an effort to bring that withdrawal about through a series of well-coordinated attacks against military and C.P.A. installations. Kut\u2019s turn came on April 5, when some 200 Mahdi militiamen began attacking the C.P.A. compound.Khulood spent hours trapped in the C.P.A. media office, as the coalition forces assigned to guard the compound returned fire. Finally a C.P.A. supervisor turned to Khulood. \u201cIf you are not afraid,\u201d he said, \u201cyou should just go.\u201dWith two other local workers, Khulood managed to thread her way out of the compound and, dodging down side alleys, to escape. With the C.P.A. compound subsequently abandoned, she remained in hiding as the Mahdi militiamen who now controlled Kut searched for any local C.P.A. employees left behind. Even after Ameri\u00adcan forces retook the city, Khulood remained so frightened she didn\u2019t leave her family\u2019s home for two weeks.The Mahdi uprising radically altered the flow of events in Iraq. Both Sunni and Shia militias sharply increased their attacks against coalition forces, marking the true beginning of the Iraq war. Despite this, the C.P.A. went ahead with their program of ceding control of Iraq to a new central government. In May, the last of the foreign civilians based in Kut began withdrawing, and within two months, the whole of the local C.P.A. infrastructure was placed under the authority of the new Baghdad government.For a time, this did seem to calm passions in Khulood\u2019s hometown, enough so that she vowed to continue the women\u2019s rights initiatives begun by her murdered mentor. That autumn, she helped found a small nongovernmental organization called Al-Batul, or Virgin. Its goals were modest. \u201cKut has a small Christian population,\u201d Khulood explained, \u201cso my idea was to bring Christian and Muslim women together to work on projects that were important to both communities. It was mainly to teach the women how to defend their rights, to show them that they didn\u2019t always have to obey what men said.\u201dBut in the deepening sectarianism spreading across Iraq, Sunni and Shia militants alike increasingly viewed the Christian community as the infidels within; in turn, terrified Christians were beginning to abandon the nation in droves, an exodus that would eventually reduce their numbers in Iraq by more than two-thirds. Further, the only possible source of funding for an endeavor like Al-Batul was from the foreign occupiers, enabling militants to denounce it as a front in the service of the enemy. Almost immediately, Khulood began receiving anonymous threats for continuing her work on \u201cAmerican issues,\u201d threats that escalated to the point where she was denounced by name in a local newspaper.The memory of that time caused Khulood, now 36, to become somber, reflective. \u201cI can see now that I was quite na\u00efve, that I didn\u2019t take the situation as seriously as I should have. But my feeling was that I was only working on things that might give women a better life, so how was I a threat?\u201dIn October 2004, the Al-Batul office in Kut was shot up. Undeterred, Khulood rented a second office, only to have it looted. That January, while attending a human rights training seminar in Amman, the capital of neighboring Jordan, she received a warning: If she resumed her work in Kut, she would be killed. She remained in Jordan for three months, but in April 2005 \u2014 a year after the death of Fern Holland and with the fighting in Iraq now spiraling into sectarian war \u2014 Khulood finally slipped back to her hometown.She recognizes now that this decision bordered on the foolhardy. \u201cIt was just very difficult for me to give up on this dream I had for Iraq,\u201d Khulood said, recalling how Holland told her that \u201cto bring change it takes people with courage, that sometimes you have to push very hard. Well, I didn\u2019t want to die, but Fern had, and I think I held onto this hope that if we kept trying, maybe things would improve.\u201dShortly after returning to Kut, Khulood went to the local police station to file a report about her looted office, only to be treated dismissively. A more ominous note was struck when she met with one of her old Al-Batul colleagues. \u201cWhy did you come back here?\u201d the woman asked. \u201cEveryone knows you\u2019re working for the Ameri\u00adcan Embassy.\u201d Her colleague\u2019s accusation came on the heels of a call summoning Khulood to the local militia headquarters. \u201cThat\u2019s when I finally saw there was no chance for me in Iraq, that if I tried any longer, they would surely kill me.\u201dEgyptSee MapBy then, Laila and her husband, Ahmed Seif, had been Egypt\u2019s most celebrated political dissident couple for well over a decade, serving as constant nuisances to the Mubarak government. Since his release from prison in 1989, Ahmed had become the nation\u2019s pre-eminent human rights lawyer, the champion of an eclectic array of defendants in politically motivated cases that included leftist university professors, Islamic fundamentalists and \u2014 in a nation where homosexuality remains effectively illegal \u2014 members of Cairo\u2019s gay community. When I first met him that autumn, Ahmed was involved in perhaps the most controversial case of his career, defending a group of men accused of complicity in a 2004 hotel bombing in the Sinai Peninsula that left 31 dead.For her part, and even while retaining her mathematics professorship at Cairo University, Laila had gained a reputation as one of Cairo\u2019s most indefatigable \u201cstreet\u201d leaders, the veteran of countless protest marches against the government. Part of what drove her was a keen awareness that, as a member of the Cairene professional class, she enjoyed a freedom to dissent that was all but denied to Egypt\u2019s poor and working class. \u201cHistorically,\u201d she said, \u201cthat bestowed a degree of immunity \u2014 the security forces really didn\u2019t like to mess with us, because they didn\u2019t know who in the power structure we could call up \u2014 but that also meant we had a responsibility, to be a voice for those who are silenced. And being a woman helped, too. In this culture, women just aren\u2019t taken that seriously, so it allows you to do things that men can\u2019t.\u201dBut she was also quite aware that her activism \u2014 and the government\u2019s grudging tolerance of it \u2014 fit neatly into the divide-and-rule strategy that Hosni Mubarak had employed since assuming power in 1981. In the past, Egyptian governments were able to gin up bipartisan support when needed by playing the anti-West, anti-Israel card, but Anwar Sadat traded that card away by making peace with Israel and going on the American payroll. The new strategy consisted of allowing an expanded level of political dissent among the small, urban educated class, while swiftly moving to crush any sign of growing influence by the far more numerous \u2014 and therefore, far more dangerous \u2014 Islamists.In Laila\u2019s estimation, what finally caused this strategy to fray was the launch of the second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, against Israel in September 2000. With most Egyptians of all politi\u00adcal persuasions holding that their government sold out the Palestinians with the 1979 peace treaty with Israel, Mubarak was suddenly powerless to muzzle pro-Palestinian demonstrations lest he be seen as an even greater lackey of the Americans. \u201cFor the first time,\u201d Laila explained, \u201cwe began organizing openly and publicly without taking any permission from the government and without taking cover under any of the so-called legitimate political parties. And what was the government going to do about it? This established the pattern \u2014 you don\u2019t wait for permission, you don\u2019t look for an existing political party to take you in, you just organize \u2014 that we used many, many times afterward.\u201dIn short order, street protests became a constant feature of Egyptian life. Even more dele\u00adterious from the government\u2019s point of view, fury over the Palestinian situation galvanized opposition groups from across the political spectrum to march and work together.With this new dynamic in place, the last thing Hosni Mubarak needed was another reminder to the Egyptian people of his fealty to Washington \u2014 but then came the United States\u2019 decision to invade Iraq.While astute enough to oppose that invasion in public, and to engage in high-profile diplo\u00admacy to try to head it off, Mubarak wasn\u2019t able to escape its fallout. In the eyes of many Egyptians, after 23 years of taking lucre from the Americans, the dictator was simply too much their puppet to make a show of independence now. That cynical view only hardened as the war in Iraq dragged on and the daily body count mounted. From 2002 through early 2005, some of the largest antiwar demonstrations in the Arab world were taking place in the streets of Cairo, and Laila Soueif was on the front lines in nearly every one of them. \u201cOf course, on the overt level it was to protest what was occurring in Iraq,\u201d Laila said, \u201cbut this also reflected the failure of Mubarak.\u201dAt the same time, the dictator did himself few favors with a series of domestic initiatives that further inflamed the opposition. Grooming his son Gamal as his successor, in February 2005 Mubarak engineered a rewriting of the Constitution that, while ostensibly allowing for direct presidential elections, actually rigged the system so as to make domination by his political party all but perpetual. In presidential elections that September, Mubarak won a fifth six-year term with nearly 89 percent of the vote, after having arrested the only notable candidate to stand against him, Ayman Nour. Under mounting pressure at home and abroad, he reduced his interference in the November 2005 parliamentary elections, only to see the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist party still officially banned, take an unprecedented 20 percent of the seats.By late 2005, when I spent six weeks traveling through Egypt, growing contempt for the government was evident everywhere. To be sure, much of that antipathy derived from the nation\u2019s economic stagnation and from the corruption that had enabled a small handful of politicians and generals to become fabulously rich \u2014 the Mubarak family financial portfolio alone was reported to run into the billions \u2014 but it also had a strong anti-American component, and pointed up a profound disjuncture. At the same time that Egypt was regarded in Washington as one of the United States\u2019 most reliable allies in the Arab world, in no small part because of its continuing entente with Israel, over the course of scores of interviews with Egyptians of most every political and religious persuasion, I failed to meet a single one who supported the Israeli peace settlement, or who regarded the American subsidies to the Mubarak government, then approaching $2 billion a year, as anything other than a source of national shame. As Essam el-Erian, deputy head of the Muslim Brotherhood, bluntly told me: \u201cThe only politics in Egypt now are the politics of the street, and for anyone to work with the Americans is to write their politi\u00adcal death sentence.\u201dIt was during this time of ferment that the three children of Laila Soueif and Ahmed Seif, who previously had shown little interest in activism, began to have a change of heart about politics. The first to make the evolution was their son, Alaa, a pioneering Egyptian blogger, and it happened when he accompanied Laila to a protest march in May 2005.\u201cHe had become very interested in citizen journalism,\u201d Laila said, \u201cso with all the street actions surrounding the Constitution and Mubarak running again, he had begun coming down to cover the demonstrations \u2014 not to participate, just to report on them.\u201dLaila Soueif is a tough, unsentimental woman, and if she harbored any pride \u2014 or, in light of what was to come, regret \u2014 over her children\u2019s turn to activism, she didn\u2019t let on. \u201cI never tried to dissuade them. Even if I had wanted to \u2014 and I probably did at times \u2014 I didn\u2019t. That kind of thing is useless. They\u2019re not going to listen to you anyway, so you just get into fights.\u201dRefugees fleeing Israeli airstrikes in Tyre, July 2006.Moments after an Israeli airstrike in Tyre, July 2006.Civilians fleeing in southern Lebanon, July 2006.After an Israeli airstrike in Qana, July 2006.A wounded Hezbollah fighter in Tyre, August 2006.After an Israeli airstrike in Beirut, August 2006.After an Israeli airstrike in Beirut, August 2006.A mass burial in Tyre, July 2006.LibyaSee MapAlong Tripoli Street, one of the city\u2019s main thoroughfares, a municipal work crew with a cherry-picker was methodically taking down the posters of Muammar el-Qaddafi that hung from every lamppost.It was part of an attempt by the Libyan dictator to put a kinder, gentler face on his government. While ostensibly directed at the Libyan people, the campaign was really meant for Western consumption.In the days leading up to the invasion of Iraq, there had been talk in President George W. Bush\u2019s inner circle that once Saddam Hussein was dispensed with, the troublesome Qaddafi would be next. Once the Iraq invasion began in March 2003, the Libyan dictator hurried to make amends with the Americans. He offered a settlement over his country\u2019s role in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland \u2014 without explicitly admitting guilt, the Libyan government agreed to set aside $2.7 billion in compensation to the families of the 270 victims \u2014 and began quietly dismantling his nation\u2019s fledgling program for chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. Even more quietly, Libyan intelligence agents shared dossiers with their American counterparts on suspected Al Qaeda operatives and other Islamic fundamentalists in the region. On the home front, the goal was to create at least the illusion of political liberalization, and one aspect was to remove some of the tens of thousands of posters and billboards of \u201cthe Leader\u201d that wallpapered the nation.Qaddafi soon thought better of the whole egalitarian makeover. By 2006, the United States had restored full diplomatic relations with his government; while officially a response to the abandonment of the Libyan unconven\u00adtional-weapons program, certainly a contributing factor was that, amid the deepening quagmire of the Iraqi misadventure, there was not going to be any grand American crusade against the region\u2019s other dictators. Which also meant that Qaddafi could quietly abandon his reform drive. \u201cIt was just a bit of theater,\u201d Majdi said. \u201cNothing really changed, and after a few months, I don\u2019t think anyone even remembered it.\u201dBut that day hadn\u2019t yet arrived when the cherry-picker made its way down Misurata\u2019s Tripoli Street. Majdi was still observing the spectacle when an elderly man emerged from a nearby alley.For a long moment, the old man stared slack-jawed in amazement at the sight before him. He then rushed over to one of the discarded posters, removed a shoe and \u2014 in a gesture of insult common throughout the Arab world \u2014 began beating it against Qaddafi\u2019s likeness amid a torrent of curses.A municipal worker came over to ask what he was doing.\u201cThe bastard\u2019s gone at last, no?\u201d the old man asked. \u201cThere\u2019s been a coup?\u201dWhen the worker set him straight, the man stammered out an explanation for his behavior \u2014 he\u2019d been very ill lately, given to fits of lunacy \u2014 and then hurried away.Jordan \u2022 United States \u2022 IraqSee MapOne evening that September, as Wisam and a friend walked along a Kut street, someone with an assault rifle killed them both in a burst of gunfire. \u201cHe was 25,\u201d Khulood said softly. \u201cSome people say he was killed because of the work I was doing, but I hope that isn\u2019t true.\u201dA few months after Wisam\u2019s murder, Khulood faced a new ordeal when, working for an NGO, she rebuffed the demands of a corrupt but well-placed Jordanian businessman looking for kickbacks. He was the wrong person to cross. Shortly after, she was ordered to leave Jordan. Facing almost-certain death if forced to return to Iraq, Khulood turned to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for emergency resettlement in a third country.Among the more unlikely possibilities for resettlement was the United States. In 2008, American troops were still embroiled in an Iraqi civil war, and the Bush administration had strict caps in place (albeit recently loosened) on the number of Iraqis to be given refuge; to let in all those who had fled the country \u2014 and there were an estimated half-million displaced Iraqis in Jordan alone \u2014 would belie its talking point that the corner had finally been turned in the war. In light of the grave danger Khulood faced, how\u00adever, the U.N.H.C.R. placed her in its own special program, reserved for only the most vulnerable of refugees, and for those in this pool, the Americans had a spot available. In July 2008, Khulood boarded a plane bound for San Francisco.It\u2019s hard to imagine a more extreme transition, from the cramped, tumbledown apartment she shared with her father and two sisters in Amman to a pleasant one-bedroom in San Francisco, and Khulood reveled in her new life. \u201cJust to have the freedom to go wherever I wanted, and to not think something bad might happen to me. And I don\u2019t mean just the war. For a woman to travel alone in Iraq \u2014 maybe it happened in Baghdad, but never in Kut, and so some days I would just take a bus or the metro for hours. It was something I had never really imagined before.\u201dHer career prospects were also much improved. In Iraq, Khulood studied English because it seemed to offer the greatest chance at future freedom for a young woman, but in the United States the opportunities were endless. \u201cAfter one year, I would get my green card, and then I could apply for scholarships to study whatever I wanted. I became very ambitious.\u201dThe one continuing source of worry was for her divided family back in Iraq and Jordan. While she knew those in Kut wouldn\u2019t leave, Khulood was desperate to release her father and sisters from their limbo existence in Amman and, soon after reaching San Francisco, she started the paperwork to have them join her.Three months later, Khulood received both good and bad news. Her two sisters were approved for resettlement. Their father, how\u00adever, was rejected. The sisters remained in Jordan while the family appealed the decision, but Ali al-Zaidi was rejected again.By February 2009, seven months after Khulood\u2019s arrival in San Francisco, there was still no progress in the effort to resettle her father. It was then she made a fateful decision: She would return to Jordan and work on his case there.\u201cMy friends in San Francisco couldn\u2019t understand it,\u201d she recalled. \u201cWhy, when you have a new life here, why would you ever go back?\u201d Khulood grew thoughtful for a moment, as if still struggling for an answer. \u201cBut how to explain my culture to them? In Iraq, family is the most important thing, you can never turn away from it, so how could I and my sisters enjoy this nice life in America but leave our father behind? We could never live with the shame of that. So I went back.\u201dIn Amman, Khulood tirelessly pursued any angle she could think of to win her father\u2019s exit, petitioning for settlement not just in the United States but also in a half-dozen European nations. Nothing worked.Worse, Khulood had walked herself into legal limbo. As she was warned before leaving San Francisco, under the stipulations of American immigration law, refugees awaiting the permanent status of a green card cannot leave the country for longer than six months. By returning \u2014 and staying \u2014 in Jordan, Khulood had lost her refugee classification. Now, along with the part of her family that she had brought out of Iraq, Khulood was stranded. She could not go home or to a third country, hostage to the whim of a state \u2014 Jordan \u2014 that was anxious to shed her.A M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res facility for Iraqi refugees in Amman, Jordan, February 2008.M.S.F. facility in Amman, February 2008.M.S.F. facility in Amman, February 2008.M.S.F. facility in Amman, February 2008.M.S.F. facility in Amman, February 2008.Iraqi refugees in Damascus, Syria, February 2008.Iraqi refugee in Damascus, February 2008.Iraqi refugee in Damascus, February 2008.SyriaSee Map\u201cI can never remember my father saying anything about the regime, good or bad,\u201d Majd Ibrahim said. \u201cAnd I never remember any of my relatives or neighbors doing it either. When it came to the state, the most anyone would criticize was maybe the corrupt traffic policeman at the corner. You just didn\u2019t talk about that stuff with anyone.\u201dBecause of his liberal upbringing, Majd experienced a shock when he left his Catholic school at the end of the ninth grade and transferred into a state high school. His modern and secular ways often estranged him from his more Islamist-minded classmates, and the instruction was abysmal. But high school is a bad time for a lot of people, and Majd\u2019s life brightened considerably upon graduating in summer 2010. While failing to obtain the high marks on the national exam that would have enabled him to pursue one of the \u201chigher\u201d professions \u2014 engineering or medicine \u2014 he did sufficiently well to enter Al-Baath University in Homs that autumn to pursue a degree in hotel management.This was undoubtedly a better fit for Majd regardless. The handsome, outgoing young man had a natural charm that enabled him to develop a quick rapport with most anyone, joined to an intense curiosity about the larger world beyond Homs. With his degree in hand, he envisioned a future at one of the luxury hotels in Damascus \u2014 they \u201crepresented one of the best ways to advance,\u201d he said, \u201cto have a good life.\u201dBut there was another feature of his hometown that Majd had probably scarcely given thought to in his short life: In almost every way, Homs truly was the crossroads of Syria. Located near the midpoint of the highway between the nation\u2019s two largest cities, Damascus and Aleppo, Homs was also the eastern terminus of the highway linking Syria\u2019s interior to its coastal provinces. Just as significant, it was the hub of the nation\u2019s gas- and oil-refinery industry \u2014 quite logically, since the pipelines leading from the oil and natural-gas fields in the eastern deserts passed directly through the city on their way to the coast. If all this served to make Homs a prosperous town, it also meant that, in the event of a war, it was a place all sides would fight furiously to control.By the time Majd started at Al-Baath University, that war was just months away.TKEgyptSee MapThe following day, as Laila approached Tahrir Square, she realized this indeed was something altogether different from the toothless Egyptian protests of the past. Until now, the Cairene activist community had considered a protest successful if it drew several hundred demonstrators. In Tahrir Square on Jan. 25, the crowd was at least 15,000, and Laila soon heard about the many thousands more who had converged on different rallying points around Cairo and in other towns and cities across Egypt. In Tahrir, as elsewhere around the nation, the stunned security forces simply stepped aside, as the emboldened crowds\u2019 calls for reform gave way to open demands for Hosni Mubarak\u2019s fall.The protests continued over the next two days, until, on Jan. 28, Laila concluded that they truly did have a revolution on their hands. That morning, she and some friends traveled to the Imbaba neighborhood in northwest Cairo to join a group intending to march on Tahrir, only to be met by a wall of soldiers in riot gear. After dispersing the protesters, the soldiers pursued them into Imbaba\u2019s narrow alleyways, firing tear gas as they went.\u201cThat was a very stupid mistake,\u201d Laila explained. \u201cThese are small alleys where people are practically living in the street, so that just brought down Imbaba. It became a fixed battle between the troops and the residents, and there was absolutely no moving those people. They were going to break down these soldiers and torch the police stations, or die trying.\u201dThe battle for Imbaba continued late into the afternoon. Laila, having become separated from her friends, decided to walk to downtown alone. It was an eerie journey. The streets were deserted, and fires raged in the growing dusk: cars, barricades, police stations burning. Echoing off the surrounding buildings came the sound of gunfire, some single shots, others the sustained bursts of assault rifles. With darkness falling, Laila finally emerged onto Ramses Street, a major thoroughfare in central Cairo.\u201cAnd suddenly, this huge crowd of demonstrators appeared,\u201d she recalled, \u201crunning down Ramses. They had just broken through the police cordons, and they were running to get to Tahrir. One young man saw me standing there, and he came over and hugged me \u2014 he\u2019d obviously seen me before, in Tahrir \u2014 and said, \u2018I told you we would have a revolution!\u2019 And that was the moment when I knew it was true, and that we would be victorious.\u201dOver the next week, both the size and the militancy of the demonstrations grew, but so did the harshness of the government\u2019s response, with soldiers and the police increasingly trading tear gas for live ammunition. On Feb. 1, a defiant Mubarak took to the airwaves vowing never to leave Egypt \u2014 \u201cOn its soil I will die\u201d \u2014 and the following day there came the bizarre spectacle, called the Battle of the Camel, when scores of state-\u00adsponsored thugs astride horses and camels attacked those encamped in Tahrir Square with riding crops and whips.The following day, Ahmed Seif\u2019s law center was raided by the military police, and he and dozens of others were hauled off for questioning at the headquarters of military intelligence. For two days, Ahmed was interrogated by a variety of officers, but he would have reason to recall one encounter in particular. It came on the morning of Feb. 5, when the chief of military intelligence, a colorless general named Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, going about other business, happened to stride past Ahmed and several other prisoners. In an impromptu lecture, Sisi warned his captive audience that they should all respect Mubarak and Egypt\u2019s military leadership and that, once released, they should go home and forget Tahrir Square. When Ahmed, forgoing respectful silence, retorted that Mubarak was corrupt, the general\u2019s haughty manner swiftly changed. \u201cHe became angry; his face became red,\u201d Ahmed recalled a few years later to The Guardian. \u201cHe acted as if every citizen would accept his point and no one would reject it in public. When he was rejected in public, he lost it.\u201dUpon his release that day, Ahmed stopped by his home for a change of clothes and then immediately returned to Tahrir Square.It soon became clear that the regime was losing control. Across Egypt came reports of army units refusing orders to fire on demonstrators, and in Tahrir Square television cameras captured images of soldiers embracing the protesters and sharing cigarettes with them.On Feb. 11, the clock finally ran out on Hosni Mubarak. After submitting his resignation, the president and his immediate family boarded a plane and fled to their palatial retreat in the Red Sea resort town Sharm el Sheikh. At the news, all of Egypt erupted in celebration, and nowhere more so than in Cairo\u2019s Tahrir Square.But among a small handful of Egyptians, joy was already tinged with a note of disquiet, especially when it was announced that a group of senior military officers, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, or SCAF, would serve as an interim government until elections were held. One of those who worried was Laila Soueif.\u201cIn the last few days of Mubarak,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen we could see what was coming, I and some of the other independents, we tried to talk to all the different political factions. \u2018Seize power. Don\u2019t wait for permission. Just seize power now before the military steps in.\u2019 And everyone said: \u2018Yes, of course, that\u2019s a good idea. We\u2019ll organize a meeting to talk about it in a couple of days.\u2019 \u201d Laila shook her head, gave a bitter little laugh. \u201cBut maybe it was asking too much. Maybe we simply couldn\u2019t do it at that point. People needed to feel they had won. Not us, the politicos, but all these millions of people who had come down to the street. They needed a time to feel victorious.\u201d She sighed, and then fell silent for a moment. \u201cI don\u2019t know. To this day, I don\u2019t know. But I think that was our critical moment, and we lost.\u201dNear Tahrir Square in Cairo, February 2011.Tahrir Square, February 2011.Tahrir Square, February 2011.Near Tahrir Square, February 2011.Tahrir Square, February 2011.Near Tahrir Square, February 2011.Near Tahrir Square, February 2011.Tahrir Square, February 2011.LibyaSee Map\u201cThat\u2019s when we knew something big had happened,\u201d Majdi recalled, \u201cbecause this was unlike anything we\u2019d seen before. But still, no one would tell us what was going on.\u201dMajdi hoped he would get an explanation when classes resumed the next morning, but the civilian instructors failed to show up. Throughout that day, Majdi stayed in the constant company of his best friend at the academy, Jalal al-\u00adDrisi, a 23-year-old cadet from Benghazi. In contrast to the shy Majdi, Jalal, wiry and quick on his feet, was always ready with an irreverent joke or an elaborate prank. What the two shared was a fascination with science and gadgetry \u2014 Jalal was studying aviation weaponry \u2014 and over the course of the previous two and a half years, they had become inseparable. Jalal frequently spent his weekend leaves at the Mangoush family home in Misurata, a hospitality that was reciprocated when Majdi spent part of the summer of 2009 with the Drisis in Benghazi. In the bizarre news-free environment that existed at the academy, the young men tried to puzzle out what was happening.Over the next two days, the gunfire beyond the walls continued sporadically. The sound would draw near at times, only to recede; intense exchanges would be followed by long periods of quiet.No sooner did Qaddafi\u2019s address end than the gunfire in Misurata significantly escalated. \u201cIt was like the security forces had been awaiting orders for what to do,\u201d Majdi said. \u201cAfter the speech, they just opened up everywhere.\u201dThe cadets remained quarantined; they were besieged by elements outside the compound walls whose goals they weren\u2019t allowed to know and kept within those walls by soldiers who clearly didn\u2019t trust them. As the days passed and the unseen gun battles raged, the students lounged around their barracks wondering what was to become of them. It was virtually all Majdi el-\u00adMangoush and Jalal al-\u00adDrisi could talk about. \u201cWe would sit together for hours and go over every little detail, every clue we had picked up,\u201d Majdi said. \u201c \u2018What did it mean? Did it mean anything?\u2019 But sometimes it got to be too much. We had to stop. We had to talk about football or girls, anything to distract us.\u201dTheir peculiar limbo ended on the night of Feb. 25, when soldiers of the elite 32nd Brigade suddenly appeared on the base. Announcing that they had come from Tripoli to \u201crescue\u201d the cadets, the commandos ordered the students to gather their things and run to a gathering point at the edge of the compound where buses were waiting.Someone in the vaunted 32nd had made a logistical error, however. To transport the 580 cadets, just two buses had been ordered. With each vehicle filled to bursting, the excess students were crammed wherever they might fit in the brigade\u2019s jeeps and armored cars, and then the convoy trundled into the night for the long journey to Tripoli.Beyond effecting their \u201crescue\u201d from Misurata, the regime in Tripoli didn\u2019t really seem to know what to do with its young charges either. Bused to a vacant military high school compound on the southern outskirts of the city, the cadets were billeted in barrack halls and empty classrooms but barred from leaving or having any contact with their families. That edict was enforced by armed soldiers posted at the gates.But the confines of the Tripoli high school were a good deal more porous than those of the air force academy, and from their minders the cadets gradually learned something of the conflict that had befallen their nation. Although the unrest was fomented by criminal gangs and foreign mercenaries in the hire of Libya\u2019s Western enemies, they were told, misguided segments of the population had joined in to spread it. By the beginning of March, this foreign-\u00adspawned criminality was most intense in Misurata and Benghazi, and both cities had become pitched battlegrounds.Provided with this narrative, Majdi was not altogether surprised when, in mid-March, Western alliance warplanes began appearing over Tripoli to bomb government installations. It seemed merely to confirm that the nation was being attacked from beyond. Naturally, the situation also caused both Majdi and Jalal to worry about the fate of their hometowns and wonder which of their friends might have been seduced into joining the traitors\u2019 ranks. \u201cThat\u2019s something we talked about a lot,\u201d Majdi said. \u201c \u2018Oh, Khalid was always a little crazy; I bet he\u2019s gone with them.\u2019 \u201dThe cadets seemed gradually to win the trust of the regime, enough for one large group to be transferred to a military base in mid-\u00adApril to begin training on missile-\u00adguidance systems. Neither Majdi nor Jalal were selected for this mission, however, and their stay at the high school dragged on. Then one day in early May, Majdi ran into an old acquaintance at the barracks. The acquaintance, Mohammed, was now a military intelligence officer. He wanted to talk to Majdi about Misurata. The two chatted for some time, with Mohammed asking about different locations in the city and if the young cadet might know who the town\u2019s \u201ccivic leaders\u201d were. Majdi thought nothing of the conversation, but one afternoon a few days later, he was called to headquarters.There, an officer informed Majdi that he had been selected to join the cadets undergoing missile-\u00adguidance training; the jeep that would transport him to the base was leaving immediately. So hurried was his departure that Majdi didn\u2019t even have time to say goodbye to Jalal.But the jeep driver didn\u2019t take him to the army base. Instead, he followed the Tripoli ring road to the coastal highway and then turned east.By early evening, they had reached Ad Dafiniyah, the last town before Misurata and the farthest limits of government control. There, Majdi was led into a small farmhouse, where he was told someone wanted to speak to him on the phone. It was Mohammed, the military intelligence officer.As Mohammed explained, the young air force cadet had been chosen for a \u201cspecial patriotic mission\u201d: He was to slip into Misurata and find out who the rebel leaders were and where they lived. Once he had done this, he would pass the information to a liaison officer secreted within Misurata, a man named Ayoub. To make contact with Ayoub, Majdi was given a Thuraya satellite phone and a number to call.Upon hearing all this, Majdi had two thoughts. One was about his friends at home: Ever since hearing about the scale of fighting in Misurata, he assumed that some of his friends must have joined the other side. If he carried out this mission, it might very well result in their deaths.The other thought was of a recent conversation he had with Jalal. His friend had awoken in a despondent state of mind, explaining that he\u2019d had a terrible dream, and it took Majdi some time to coax out the details. \u201cI dreamt that you and I were sent to fight in Misurata,\u201d Jalal finally revealed, \u201cand that you were killed.\u201dBut any hesitation swiftly passed. In his goldfish-\u00adbowl existence in Tripoli, Majdi had heard only what the regime wanted him to hear, and if he didn\u2019t believe all of it, he believed enough of it to want to help defeat the foreigners and their followers who were destroying Libya, even if this included people he knew. Perhaps most of all, he just wanted the limbo to end. For nearly three months, he had been cut off from both his family and the outside world, and he simply wanted something \u2014 anything \u2014 to happen. So he agreed.Early the next morning, Majdi said goodbye to his companions at the farmhouse and headed alone into no man\u2019s land. Misurata lay some 10 miles to the east. In the right front pocket of his pants he carried his military identification card. If stopped by the rebels, this card in itself was unlikely to cause him problems; countless government soldiers had deserted, and the fact that Majdi was from Misurata would certainly lend credence to his explanation that he was trying only to go home. The satellite phone in his left pocket was a very different matter, though. With the severing of internet and cellphone reception, the Thuraya had become the standard mode of communication for regime operatives in the field, and if the rebels discovered Majdi\u2019s \u2014 sure to be found in the most cursory of searches \u2014 they would inevitably conclude that he was coming into Misurata as a spy. Under those circumstances, summary execution was probably the most merciful outcome he could hope for.As he walked, the sound of gunfire grew in intensity, and there was the occasional rumble of distant artillery explosions. But between the light wind and the rolling-\u00adhill topography of the Misurata coastal shelf, it was quite impossible for Majdi to determine how close any of it was or even its direction. He tried to bear in mind something he picked up in basic training, that the most worrisome noise on a battlefield wasn\u2019t gunshots but rather a soft popping sound, like the snapping of fingers. This was the sound the air made as it rejoined behind a bullet, and you heard it only when a bullet passed close to your head.Majdi\u2019s memory of that journey is vague. He doesn\u2019t remember how long it took; he estimates that he walked for about three hours, but it could have been shorter or twice as long. Only one moment sticks out in his mind. About halfway across no man\u2019s land, Majdi was suddenly filled with a sense of joy unlike anything he had ever experienced before.\u201cI can\u2019t really describe it,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019ve never had a feeling like it since, but I was just so happy, so completely at peace with everything.\u201d He fell silent for a time, groping for an explanation. \u201cI think it\u2019s because I was in the one place where I was out from the shadow of others. I hadn\u2019t betrayed my friends yet, I hadn\u2019t betrayed my country yet \u2014 that is what lay ahead \u2014 so as long as I stayed out there, I was free.\u201dSyriaSee MapShortly after that interview, however, Syria\u2019s state-\u00adcontrolled media went silent on the whole topic. Certainly there was scant mention when, in early March, demonstrators took to the streets of the southern Syrian city Dara\u2019a to protest the arrest and reported torture of a group of high-school students for writing anti-\u00adgovernment graffiti on walls. \u201cI heard about what happened in Dara\u2019a through social media,\u201d Majd said, \u201cfrom Facebook and YouTube.\u201dIt was from the same venues that Majd learned of a solidarity protest, called the Day of Dignity, that was to take place in front of the Khaled bin al-\u00adWaleed Mosque in downtown Homs on March 18. Heeding the admonitions of his parents, Majd stayed well away from that rally, but he heard through friends that hundreds of demonstrators had shown up, watched over by a nearly equal number of police officers and state security personnel. It was a shocking story to the 18-year-old college student; Homs had simply never experienced anything like it.And that demonstration was tiny in comparison with the next, held a week later. This time, the protesters numbered in the thousands. Majd, figuring there was safety in numbers amid the throngs of onlookers, managed to get close enough to hear their demands: for political reform, greater civil rights, a repeal of the state-\u00adof-\u00ademergency edict that had been in place in Syria for the previous 48 years.On March 30, Assad delivered a speech to the Syrian Parliament, carried live by state television and radio outlets. While protests had spread to a number of Syrian cities, they were still largely peaceful, with dissenters calling for changes in the regime rather than for its overthrow. As a result \u2014 and with the assumption that the regime had learned something from the recent collapse of the Tunisian and Egyptian governments and the widening chaos in Libya \u2014 many expected Assad to take a conciliatory approach.That expectation was also based on Assad\u2019s personality. In the 11 years he had ruled the nation since the death of his father, the unassuming ophthalmologist had adopted many trappings of reform. With his attractive young wife, the British-\u00adborn Asma, he had put a pleasing, modern face on the Syrian autocracy. Behind the charm offensive, however, little had truly changed; Syria\u2019s secret police were still everywhere, and the \u201cdeep state\u201d \u2014 the country\u2019s permanent ruling class of bureaucrats and military figures \u2014 remained firmly in the hands of the Alawite minority. The Alawites, along with many in Syria\u2019s Christian minority, feared that any compromise with the protesters was to invite a Sunni revolution and, with it, their demise.After offering vague palliatives about future reform, Assad instead used his parliamentary speech to accuse the troublemakers in the streets of aiding the \u201cIsraeli enemy\u201d and to issue a stern warning. \u201cBurying sedition is a national, moral and religious duty, and all those who can contribute to burying it and do not are part of it,\u201d he declared. \u201cThere is no compromise or middle way in this.\u201d In keeping with a tradition begun during his father\u2019s reign, Assad\u2019s speech was repeatedly interrupted by members of Parliament leaping to their feet to shout out their undying love and gratitude to the president.In Majd\u2019s memory, a kind of uneasy quiet fell over Homs after Assad\u2019s address. There were still scattered protests about town, watched over by phalanxes of heavily armed security forces, but it was as if no one was quite sure what to do next \u2014 each side fearful, perhaps, of leading the nation into the kind of open warfare then roiling Libya.Then matters took an even more sinister turn. In this most religiously mixed of Syrian cities, suddenly people began turning up dead for no other discernible reason than their religious affiliation. In early November 2011, according to an unconfirmed account from Reuters, gunmen stopped a bus and murdered nine Alawite passengers. The next day, at a nearby roadblock, Syrian security forces, seemingly in retaliation, led 11 Sunni laborers off to be executed. All the while, a terror campaign of kidnappings and assassinations targeted the city\u2019s professional class, leading many of them to go into hiding or flee.The fighting also had a surreal inconstancy. Some districts saw scorched-\u00adearth battle, even as, in others, shops stayed open and the cafes were full. Throughout, Majd Ibrahim continued his hotel-\u00admanagement courses at Al-\u00adBaath University. His neighborhood, Waer, remained one of the least affected by the violence, and by carefully monitoring the news for reports of specific conflagrations, he was able on most days to navigate the two-mile journey to his campus. By February 2012, however, the combat had become so indiscriminate that the university announced it was temporarily closing. At the same time, rumors began circulating through Homs that the Syrian Army would be returning in force, this time to put down the rebellion once and for all.\u201cThat\u2019s when my parents decided to send me to Damascus,\u201d Majd explained. \u201cWith the university closed and the fighting about to get worse, they felt there was no reason for me to stay \u2014 and it was going to become especially dangerous for young men.\u201d When Majd left for the Syrian capital in early February, he passed a seemingly endless line of army transport trucks, tanks and artillery pieces parked on the shoulder of the highway just outside Homs. The next day, the Syrian Army moved in.LibyaSee Map\u201cIs your father here?\u201d Majdi asked the boy. \u201cWill you take me to your father?\u201dAt the farmhouse, he met the boy\u2019s father, a man in his 30s, who was both astonished and deeply suspicious of this stranger emerging from no man\u2019s land. Majdi repeated his cover story: that he had deserted from the regime and was trying to reach his family. He was helped in this subterfuge by his surname, for everyone in Misurata knew of the Mangoush clan. The man\u2019s wariness eased off, and he offered Majdi a lift into town.As much as he\u2019d heard about the fighting in his hometown, Majdi was unprepared for the reality. Since late February 2011, Misurata had been increasingly under siege by government forces, its residents becoming almost wholly dependent on whatever food and medical supplies could be brought in by sea. All the while, the army had rained down artillery shells, while its soldiers fought the rebels alley by alley, person by person, just as Qaddafi had promised. The siege abated somewhat with the advent of Western alliance airstrikes in late March, but the damage done to the city was staggering. Everywhere Majdi could see buildings blasted by tank shells or scorched by fire, destruction so great that in some places he couldn\u2019t even tell which street or intersection they were passing.The man from the farmhouse dropped Majdi off at his family\u2019s home. \u201cI just came through the front door,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThe first person I saw was my sister. And then there were my sister-\u00adin-\u00adlaw and my brother\u2019s children.\u201d At the memory, Majdi blinked back tears. \u201cIt had been three months. I thought I would never see them again.\u201dMajdi spent the rest of that day in reunion with his family. He learned that after his father became seriously ill, his parents had gone out aboard a medical evacuation ship to Tunisia. He also learned that the list of local \u201ctraitors\u201d to the regime didn\u2019t just consist of old friends but extended to his own family; in fact, for several weeks, his oldest brother, Mohammed, had secreted a group of deserting air force helicopter pilots in his own home. Everyone, it seemed, had joined the revolution and was now committed, after all Misurata had suffered, to see it through to the finish.At some point during this family gathering, Majdi briefly excused himself to go to his old bedroom. There, he took the Thuraya from his pocket and hid it on a shelf behind a bundle of bedding. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what I was going to do yet,\u201d he said. \u201cI just knew that I had to hide that phone.\u201dOver the next week, the returned son of Misurata wandered about his ruined city, meeting up with friends and learning of those who had been wounded or killed in battle. In the process, he came to see that everything he had been told and had believed about the war was a lie. There were no criminals, there were no foreign mercenaries \u2014 at least not among the rebels. There were only people like his own family, desperate to throw off dictatorship.But this realization placed Majdi in a very delicate spot. Ayoub, his intelligence contact, surely knew of his arrival in Misurata and was expecting him to report in. Majdi briefly entertained the idea of simply discarding the Thuraya and going on as if nothing had happened, but then he thought of the repercussions that would befall his family if the regime won out in the end. Or what if the rebels uncovered the regime\u2019s spy cell in the city and his name surfaced?Faced with these possibilities, the air force cadet came up with a far more clever \u2014 and dangerous \u2014 plan. In mid-May, he presented himself to the local rebel military council and revealed all. As Majdi well knew, for a would-be spy to throw himself on the mercy of the enemy in wartime is never a good bet \u2014 the rebels\u2019 most expedient path would be to imprison or execute him \u2014 but against this outcome, he made a bold offer.The next morning, Majdi finally contacted Ayoub, his regime handler, and agreed to meet two days later in a vacant apartment building downtown. At that meeting, a group of rebel commandos burst in with guns drawn and quickly wrestled both men to the ground. Majdi and Ayoub were then placed in different cars for transport to prison. By the time the rebel military council announced that it had captured \u201ctwo regime spies\u201d in Misurata, Majdi was already back at his family home.Although the sting had come off perfectly, there were apt to be other regime operatives aware of Majdi\u2019s assignment, making it risky for him to move about the city. He took advantage of the moment to slip off to Tunisia to visit his parents.For Majdi, then 24, the contrast of Tunisia \u2014 modern, peaceful \u2014 was yet another journey into bewilderment. \u201cIt was so quiet, so relaxed,\u201d he recalled, \u201cthat it took me some time to believe it was real.\u201dMajdi might easily have stayed on in Tunisia; it\u2019s certainly what his parents wanted. But after a few weeks, he grew restless, gnawed by a sense that his role in his country\u2019s war wasn\u2019t complete. \u201cI think part of it was a kind of revenge. I had been with the army, but they had lied and manipulated me. And, of course, the war wasn\u2019t over yet; people were still fighting and dying. I told my parents I had no choice. I had to go home.\u201dBack in Misurata, Majdi immediately became active with a local rebel militia, the Dhi Qar Brigade, for the march on Qaddafi\u2019s redoubt in Tripoli. Before he could be deployed there, however, the government forces in the capital collapsed, and the dictator and his remaining loyalists retreated down the coast to Surt, Qaddafi\u2019s tribal homeland district. There, surrounded and with their backs to the sea, they waged a desperate last stand. For a month, Majdi\u2019s unit held a stretch of the Surt bypass highway, shelling regime strongholds and engaging in the occasional firefight whenever the trapped soldiers tried to break out. As elsewhere in the Libyan war \u2014 as in most wars, frankly \u2014 combat in Surt was an oddly desultory affair, moments of intense action followed by long stretches of tedium, and to Majdi it seemed this rhythm might continue indefinitely.Instead, it ended very suddenly on Oct. 20, 2011. That morning, a fierce firefight erupted in the western part of Surt, punctuated by a series of airstrikes from Western coalition warplanes; from his perch on the bypass road, Majdi saw enormous plumes of fire and dust rising up from the bombs exploding around the city. Around 2 p.m., there came another concentrated flurry of small-arms fire from the western suburbs, one that lasted about 20 minutes, before all fell quiet. Initially, Majdi and his comrades thought it meant that Qaddafi\u2019s men had surrendered, but there soon came even better news: The dictator himself had been captured and killed. \u201cWe all cheered and hugged each other,\u201d Majdi recalled, \u201cbecause we knew it meant the war was over. After all that killing \u2014 and after 42 years of Qaddafi \u2014 a new day had finally come to Libya.\u201dWith the fighting at an end, Majdi returned to Misurata and transferred to a militia unit more suited to his gentle character: an ambulance crew ferrying the more severely war-\u00adwounded from Misurata\u2019s hospitals to the airport for advanced medical treatment abroad. He greatly enjoyed this work, which he felt showed tangible evidence of recovery after so much death and devastation, and it fortified his optimism about the future.Then one December day at the Misurata airport, Majdi received a visitor. He was Sameh al-\u00adDrisi, the older brother of his friend Jalal, and he had traveled the 500 miles from Benghazi to ask a favor. The Libyan revolution had been over for two months, but the last time anyone in the Drisi family had heard from Jalal was in May. That communication was a short phone call from the Tripoli high school where the air force cadets had been sequestered, and it came just days after Majdi left for his spying mission to Misurata.Changing course once again, Majdi set out in search of his lost friend with a tenacity that bordered on obsession. Returning to Tripoli, he spent weeks tracking down some of their former academy classmates and, from them, was able to piece together at least part of the mystery. In May 2011, Jalal had been among a group of some 50 cadets at the Tripoli high school who were assembled and told they were being sent to assist front-line troops as they advanced on the rebels in Misurata, checking for old booby-\u00adtraps and guarding communication and supply lines. Instead, the cadets were used as bait there, sent out over open ground to be shot and shelled at, while the regime\u2019s more seasoned soldiers sat back to observe where the enemy fire was coming from. As one cadet after another fell on this suicide mission, Jalal and two of his comrades managed to reach an outlying farm, where they begged an old farmer to take them south, away from the battlefield; instead, the farmer betrayed the students and delivered them to internal security forces, who in turn delivered them right back to the army. After a round of beatings, the three were sent back to their suicide squad.But that was as far as the tale went. Shortly after, Jalal\u2019s two companions had made a second escape attempt \u2014 this time successfully \u2014 but by then Jalal had been moved to a different part of the front.This set Majdi off on a new search. He finally found another former classmate who completed the story. One day in June, a small group of the cadets \u2014 Jalal and others who had managed to survive that long \u2014 were bivouacked along a farm road on Misurata\u2019s southern outskirts when an officer drove up and called the students over for a situation report. In that same moment, a missile from an unseen Western alliance warplane or drone blew apart the officer\u2019s car, instantly killing him and most of the cadets standing nearby. When the missile struck, Jalal was sitting beneath a tree some 50 yards away, but it was there that an errant piece of shrapnel found him, tearing off the top of his head. His surviving companions buried Jalal\u2019s spilled brain beneath the tree but put his corpse in a truck with the other dead for transport to some unknown cemetery.\u201cOf course I was reminded of the dream he\u2019d had,\u201d Majdi said. \u201cYes, we\u2019d both gone to Misurata to fight, but it was he who died.\u201dFor most people, this might have meant an end to the search, but not Majdi. Recalling the time he had spent with Jalal\u2019s family in Benghazi, the hospitality they had shown him, he was determined to find his friend\u2019s body so that it might be returned to them. After knocking on the doors of countless functionaries in the new revolutionary government, he was finally directed to a Tripoli cemetery where the \u201ctraitors\u201d \u2014 that is, Qaddafi regime loyalists \u2014 had been gathered up and buried.It was a grim, trash-\u00adstrewn stretch of land dotted with hundreds of graves. Majdi methodically passed down each row, but Jalal\u2019s name wasn\u2019t listed. Finally, he came to a far corner of the cemetery where he saw a grave marked \u201cunknown.\u201d Majdi felt a burst of excitement, for it occurred to him that given Jalal\u2019s terrible head wound, identification might have been impossible \u2014 but then he noticed three more graves with the same \u201cunknown\u201d markers. Returning to the cemetery office, he asked for the photographs taken of the unidentified corpses before burial: The faces of all four were so horribly damaged as to be unrecognizable.Still, Majdi was now convinced that one of the four was Jalal. He broke the news to the Drisi family and several months later flew to Benghazi to pay his respects to them in person. \u201cIt was a very emotional meeting,\u201d he said, \u201cand I apologized to them for not being able to watch out for Jalal, but. ...\u201d He drifted off in sadness for a moment, but then abruptly righted himself. \u201cSo that is it. Jalal is in one of those four graves, that is for sure.\u201dSyriaSee MapMajd had kept in regular contact with his parents and friends during his Damascus stay, so he knew that the fighting in Homs had been centered in the Baba Amr neighborhood south of downtown. He\u2019d been told that the damage was extensive, but he wasn\u2019t prepared for the reality. \u201cWe drove past it on the day I got back,\u201d he recalled, \u201cand \u2014 well, it was just gone. Everything was gone. I remember thinking \u2014 trying to find something positive, you know? \u2014 Everyone should come see this. If people saw Baba Amr now, maybe it would be a lesson. They would understand how terrible war is.\u201d The na\u00efvet\u00e9 of that notion soon became obvious; within weeks of Majd\u2019s return, the battle for Homs started up in earnest again. This time, the regime was targeting the insurgents in the Khalidiya neighborhood, and because the army\u2019s main artillery staging ground was next to the Waer district, it meant shells passed directly over the Ibrahims\u2019 apartment building at all hours.\u201cWhen they went overhead,\u201d Majd said, \u201cit was like the air was sucked away. I don\u2019t know how else to describe it, but you felt it in your lungs. It was hard to breathe for maybe a half-\u00adminute afterward, like all the oxygen was gone.\u201dThe fighting in Homs raged on through the summer of 2012, with the Syrian military methodically targeting one rebel-\u00adheld neighborhood after another, their ground-troop assaults backed up by tanks, artillery and helicopter gunships. Throughout, though, the middle-\u00adclass neighborhood of Waer remained an oasis of comparative calm. Majd attributed it to Waer\u2019s diversity; with its mixed population of Sunnis, Alawites and Christians, none of the rebel militias could truly control the enclave \u2014 and if the militias weren\u2019t there in force, the overextended Syrian Army couldn\u2019t be bothered.By the autumn of 2012, that began to change. On the streets of Waer, Majd noticed more and more young men toting weapons, and of those who wore insignia, by far the most common was that of the Free Syrian Army, or F.S.A. The militiamen also took notice of Majd. Of perfect combat age at 20, he found his daily ventures to the university growing ever more stressful as the gunmen demanded to know who he was allied with or taunted him for not \u201cjoining up.\u201dIn response to the growing tension in Waer, the Ibrahims began renting a \u201cshelter home\u201d \u2014 a safety measure that many of the city\u2019s more affluent residents were adopting. By now, so many families had fled Homs that furnished apartments sat empty throughout the city. Contacting one such family that had left for Damascus, Majd\u2019s father arranged to rent their apartment in an outlying neighborhood for use whenever trouble cropped up in Waer. At first, the Ibrahims decamped to their shelter home only occasionally, but by early 2013 their flights had increased in frequency to two or three times a week. Their greatest concern was for the safety of their eldest son at the hands of the militias.\u201cMost of them were just guys from the neighborhood who\u2019d managed to get their hands on some guns,\u201d Majd explained. \u201cI knew a lot of them \u2014 I\u2019d grown up with them \u2014 so that was good. But more and more were coming in from the outside, and those guys were tough. A lot of them were survivors of the battles in Baba Amr and Khalidiya. They were suspicious of everyone, and you just never knew what they were going to do.\u201dAdding another unsettling element to the mix, a lot of the fighters were on drugs, habitually popping an amphetamine called Captagon that could keep them alert for days, counteracted by an anti-\u00adanxiety drug called Zolam to bring them down.Of all the various armed groups that had pitched up in Waer \u2014 and many were little more than neighborhood self-\u00addefense committees \u2014 the Free Syrian Army spurred a particular disdain in Majd. While many in American foreign-\u00adpolicy circles were professing to see secular progressives who, if supported, might lead Syria to democracy, Majd saw only a bunch of opportunists and cowards.\u201cAt least the guys in the Islamist groups had some beliefs and discipline,\u201d he said, \u201cbut most of the F.S.A. in Waer were just young guys who wanted to walk around with guns and scare people. And the funny thing about that is they were the ones who scared very easily. If another group came into their area, they would just turn around and join that group.\u201dLibyaSee Map\u201cAnd we were just students,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s all we were. Both sides used us. Both sides slaughtered us.\u201dDespite all this, Majdi was initially very optimistic about the future in post-\u00adrevolutionary Libya; the country had oil, smart people and, after the 42-year reign of Col. Muammar el-\u00adQaddafi, the will for a better life. In his view, the first great misstep was when the interim government in Tripoli, the Transitional National Council, announced that it would pay stipends to all those who had fought against the Qaddafi regime. Within weeks, the number of \u201crevolutionaries\u201d \u2014 approximately 20,000 by the most generous estimate \u2014 had mushroomed to some 250,000. Worse, the structure of the compensation, acquiesced to by Western governments allied with the transitional council, created an incentive for new armed groups not just to form but to remain independent of any central command, the better to demand their own share of the compensation pie. Already by the close of 2012, Libyan militias \u2014 some composed of true revolutionary veterans, others no more than tribal or criminal gangs \u2014 had begun carving the country into rival fiefs, their ability to do so bankrolled by the very central government that they were undermining. That instability was made painfully clear to the Obama administration when the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi was attacked in September 2012, leading to the deaths of Ambassador J.Christopher Stevens and three others. But for Majdi, final disillusionment took a more personal form. In the autumn of 2012, he received his \u201cdiploma\u201d from the air force academy, announcing that he had successfully completed all the requirements for a degree in communication engineering.\u201cI hadn\u2019t completed anything,\u201d he said. \u201cThere had been no classes for a year and a half, so this paper was absolutely meaningless. But this was the new Libya: Everything was just lies and corruption. And maybe I felt it more because of what I had gone through, all my friends at the academy who had been killed, but I just couldn\u2019t accept that. \u2018Here, take this paper. No one has to know. Call yourself an engineer.\u2019 Maybe others felt it in a different way, or they think of it more in political terms, but it was when I received my diploma that I saw the revolution had been betrayed, that Libya was a failed state.\u201dMajdi faced a stark choice: He could use his sham diploma to land some inconsequential government job, or he could start over. The next year, he enrolled in Misurata University to study engineering. Around the time he started back at school, Majdi also became involved with an environmental group based in Tripoli called Tree Lovers. He was so inspired by its work that he helped start a Misurata branch. While both money and supplies are tight, Majdi and other volunteers have planted flowers and shrubs along many of the city\u2019s dusty median strips and sought to raise awareness about the importance of preserving the very little vegetation Libya possesses. \u201cThe desert is spreading in lots of places in Libya,\u201d he said, \u201cand the only way to stop that is with trees.\u201dBut there may have been a more personal impulse at work on Majdi. One of the more intriguing phenomena observed among ex-\u00adsoldiers most everywhere is a desire for solitude, to be out in nature, and when I visited him in Misurata, Majdi was eager to show me the forest that he and his fellow conservationists tended. On an early morning, we drove out of Misurata for the farm fields and small villages at its southern outskirts.Majdi\u2019s \u201cforest\u201d proved to be little more than a few rows of scraggly pines set beside a farm road, with trash strewn about from careless picnickers, but he was very proud of it. Stepping around the garbage, he strolled among the trees and breathed in deeply of the pine scent with a satisfied smile.EgyptSee Map\u201cSo what to do?\u201d Laila asked rhetorically. \u201cMorsi was completely unacceptable, but now it was him or Shafik, so we were stuck. Well, never Shafik \u2014 that meant a return to the Mubarak era \u2014 so. ...\u201dIn just this way, Laila Soueif, the stalwart feminist and leftist, found herself backing the election of a man who advocated returning Egypt to traditional Islamic values. Many other Egyptians were aghast at the choice given to them; in the June runoff, Morsi barely squeaked in with 51.7 percent of the vote.In his inaugural speech on June 30, Morsi promised that \u201cin the new Egypt, the president will be an employee, a servant to the people.\u201d But a servant to the deep state may have been more accurate. Just days before the new president assumed office, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, or SCAF, the military junta that had ruled Egypt since Mubarak\u2019s overthrow, transferred most presidential powers to the military. That followed a decree by the Supreme Constitutional Court, a holdover from the Mubarak era, that dissolved a sitting Parliament dominated by the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist political parties. On the day he assumed office, then, Morsi was barely more than a figurehead, the public face to a democracy already gutted.Morsi tried mightily to claw back the authority taken from his office. Ignoring the fiat of the Supreme Constitutional Court, he ordered the dissolved Islamist-\u00addominated Parliament reinstated. Even more boldly, he dismissed the senior military leadership, including the powerful defense minister. In his place, Morsi promoted his own man, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the general who had lectured Ahmed Seif during his 2011 detention.But then Morsi overreached \u2014 badly. In October 2012, he tried to expand the powers of the presidency by decree, a move that alarmed both the deep state and the secular opposition, already growing increasingly fearful of creeping Islamization. Morsi swiftly reeled back some of the more controversial planks in his decree, but the damage was done; in a new round of protests across Egypt, the president was denounced for trying to become a new \u201cpharaoh\u201d or \u201cayatollah.\u201dAnd here was the opening the deep state seemed to have been waiting for, the chance to reopen the traditional schism that existed between its Islamist and secular opponents. For decades, the Egyptian generals had held up the Islamists \u2014 and most particularly the Muslim Brotherhood \u2014 as the greatest threat to the modern secular state and naturally positioned themselves as the guardians against them. This strategy had broken down during the heady days of revolution, with Islamists and progressives alike turning against the generals, but Ahmed Seif had seen how easily it could be resurrected. At a meeting of human rights activists organized by Amnesty International the year before, when Egypt was still under the control of the SCAF generals, one attendee after another expressed concern about the possibility of an Islamist electoral victory. As Scott Long, an activist who was at the meeting, recalled on his personal blog, the normally soft-\u00adspoken Ahmed finally slapped his hand against the conference table. \u201cI will not accept that the American government, or Amnesty, or anyone, will tell me that I need to tolerate a military dictatorship in order to avoid a takeover by Islamist people,\u201d he said. \u201cI will not accept such false choices.\u201dNow, with Morsi\u2019s overreach as president, that \u201cfalse choice\u201d was becoming increasingly stark.\u201cIt was very clear what the state was doing,\u201d Laila said. \u201cFirst, block everything that Morsi tries to do, so that nothing gets done. \u2018He\u2019s a failed president.\u2019 But second, feed the fears about him. That was easy to do, because the propaganda against the Muslim Brotherhood \u2014 \u2018They\u2019re terrorists\u2019 \u2014 went back 50 years,\u201d and the propaganda had at least some basis in reality: In the 1990s, factions of the Muslim Brotherhood had formed alliances with actual terrorists groups.By the spring of 2013, Egypt was becoming rapidly polarized between Morsi\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood followers and nearly everyone else. Perversely, many of the same young demonstrators who took to the streets in 2011 to demand democracy were now calling for Morsi\u2019s overthrow. Even more perversely, they looked to the one state institution capable of carrying that out: the Egyptian military.This wasn\u2019t simply a case of national amnesia. One of the more curious aspects of Egyptian society has been a longstanding reverence for its military, a tradition inculcated in Egyptian students from primary school. As a result, even during Mubarak\u2019s era, many Egyptians regarded the military as somehow apart from the venal dictatorship it upheld. Nevermind that the army was, in fact, a major beneficiary of that corrupt system \u2014 the Egyptian military owned construction companies, engineering firms, even a pasta factory \u2014 what a lot of those who took to the streets in anti-\u00adMorsi demonstrations in 2013 recalled was that the army had been instrumental in finally toppling Mubarak two years before. If the guardians of the nation had acted to overthrow one dictator, why not a second one in the making?\u201cYou could see what was about to happen,\u201d Laila said. \u201cYes, Morsi was a disaster, he had to go, but to invite in the military was worse. But so many people I knew, even people who had been in Tahrir, this is what they wanted.\u201dOn June 30, 2013, the first anniversary of Morsi\u2019s inauguration, huge demonstrations took place throughout Egypt, with protesters demanding that he step down. They were met in the streets by counter\u00addemonstrations of Morsi\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood supporters. All but invisible between these two great factions was a small group of protesters advocating a third path. It included Laila Soueif and her daughter, Mona.\u201cWe gathered in one corner near Tahrir,\u201d Mona recalled with a rueful laugh, \u201cand chanted, \u2018Not Morsi, and not the army.\u2019 People going by gave us these confused looks, like we were all crazy, and I\u2019m sure we kind of seemed that way.\u201dIt was at this critical juncture that the defense minister, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, until then regarded as a bland functionary, finally stepped from the shadows. On July 1, the general delivered an ultimatum to the man who had appointed him, giving Morsi 48 hours \u201cto meet the demands of the people\u201d or the army would step in to restore order. Pointing out that he was the elected head of state, the president defiantly dismissed the threat.\u201cMorsi made two great mistakes,\u201d Laila said. \u201cFirst, he thought the army wouldn\u2019t move against him without the approval of the Americans. He didn\u2019t realize the generals didn\u2019t care about the Americans anymore. Second, he trusted Sisi.\u201dTrue to his word, on July 3, Sisi overthrew the Egyptian government. He also annulled the Constitution, arrested Morsi and other Muslim Brotherhood leaders and shut down four television stations. Within days, he announced the formation of an interim \u201ctransitional\u201d government, one composed of military officers and Mubarak-\u00adera apparatchiks, but all Egyptians knew that the real authority now lay with Sisi.It was on the streets of Egypt where the face of the new regime was most nakedly revealed. In the days after Sisi took power, clashes between his supporters and those of the ousted president turned increasingly violent, with the police and the military making very clear whose side they were on. On July 8, security forces fired on Morsi loyalists gathered in central Cairo, killing at least 51. That episode set the stage for far worse. On the afternoon of Aug. 14, security forces moved in to Cairo\u2019s Rabaa Square with orders to disperse the several thousand Morsi holdout supporters who had been camped there during the previous month. By the most reliable estimates, at least 800 and perhaps more than 1,000 protesters were killed in the ensuing massacre. In an obscene parody of the 2011 revolution, hundreds took to Cairo\u2019s streets over the following days to praise the army for its actions.For Laila Soueif, there was to be another, far more personal indication that the new Egyptian regime was different from those that had come before.Laila\u2019s son, Alaa, bore the dubious distinction of having been arrested by all three Egyptian governments that preceded Sisi\u2019s takeover: those of Mubarak, SCAF and Morsi. In 2006, he spent 45 days in jail for joining a demonstration calling for greater judicial independence. During the SCAF administration, he did a two-month stint in detention for \u201cinciting violence.\u201d He fared better under Morsi, if only because the judges, Mubarak-\u00adera holdovers, detested the new president; his March 2013 charge of \u201cinciting aggression\u201d was summarily dismissed, while his conviction for arson resulted in a one-year suspended sentence.Given this track record, it was probably just a matter of time before Alaa was picked up by the new Egyptian regime. That occurred on Nov. 28, 2013, when he was arrested on charges of inciting violence and, in a nice Orwellian touch, protesting an anti-\u00adprotest law enacted just four days earlier. That note of black humor aside, under the rule of Sisi, matters were to play out very differently for Laila\u2019s son from the way they had in the past.Refugees coming from Libya at the border near Ben Gardane, March 2011.Near Ben Gardane, March 2011.Near Ben Gardane, March 2011.Near Ben Gardane, March 2011.Near Ben Gardane, March 2011.On a bus near Ben Gardane, March 2011.Near Ben Gardane, March 2011.SyriaSee MapThat dynamic ended in early May 2013. In a colossal misstep, the Free Syrian Army had recently moved back into the devastated Baba Amr neighborhood, and there had been surrounded and slaughtered. Those who managed to escape the regime\u2019s cordon made for Waer and took near total control of the enclave. Sure enough, Syrian army artillery shells soon began raining down on Majd\u2019s neighborhood. While the scale of shelling was nothing like what befell Baba Amr or Khalidiya, it was enough to keep the Ibrahim family in their fourth-floor apartment, forever trying to guess where safety lay.\u201cYou just never knew what to do,\u201d Majd explained. \u201cIs it better here or in the shelter home? And if it\u2019s safer there, how dangerous is it to try to get there?\u201dAs bizarre as it might seem, one reason the Ibrahims stayed on in Homs despite the ever-\u00adworsening situation was that Majd\u2019s finals were coming up at the university. Their insistence on his finishing was not some homage to the value of higher education; under Syrian law, college students were exempt from conscription, so as long as Majd stayed in school, he was safe from being drafted. Once he took his exams at the end of July, his parents decided, they would reassess the situation and decide what came next.That gamble nearly led to disaster. On the afternoon of July 5, Majd was talking with friends on a Waer street when a white station wagon pulled up and three young F.S.A. fighters with Kalashnikovs jumped out. Grabbing Majd, they dragged him into the car where, blindfolded, he was driven to their nearby base.\u201cI thought it was a joke at the beginning,\u201d Majd said. \u201cBut they knew my name, my age, what I was studying in the university. They wanted me, not anyone else.\u201dFor the next few hours, Majd\u2019s captors insisted that he admit to being a regime spy, meeting protestations of innocence with kicks and punches. Finally, he was forced to his knees, and an F.S.A. man put a large knife to his throat. Another aimed a Kalashnikov at his head.\u201cWell, this is the standard way they execute,\u201d Majd said softly, \u201cso I knew this was about to happen to me. They wanted to kill me very badly.\u201dIn prelude to his execution, however, the chief interrogator thought to look through Majd\u2019s cellphone. With each phone number and photograph he flipped to, he demanded that Majd finally give up the identity of his \u201ccontroller.\u201d The 20-year-old\u2019s continued professions of innocence brought more kicks, more punches. The interrogator came to the stored photograph of one young man in particular and stopped.\u201cWhy do you have this guy\u2019s photo?\u201d he asked.\u201cBecause he\u2019s my best friend,\u201d Majd replied.The F.S.A. commander slowly turned to his captive. \u201cWe will call him.\u201dThe commander left the room, and for a long time Majd remained on his knees, the knife to his throat and the gun to his head. Quite unbeknown to Majd, his best friend was also an acquaintance of the F.S.A. commander, and he came to the base to assure the militiaman that Majd Ibrahim was no regime spy. Majd learned this only when the commander returned to the interrogation room and told him he would be set free.\u201cSo that is what saved my life,\u201d Majd said, \u201cthat photograph.\u201dDuring the drive back to Waer, the F.S.A. commander started a long sales pitch on why Majd should quit the university and take up arms against the regime. Majd said he would think about it.When he arrived at the spot where he had been picked up earlier that day, his parents and friends were waiting for him. The next morning, July 6, the Ibrahim family left for their shelter home, never to return to the Waer neighborhood where Majd had lived his entire life. It was his 21st birthday.JordanSee MapKhulood\u2019s work at KnK had undergone a shift, though. With the war in Iraq having abated, the number of Iraqi refugees in Jordan was drastically reduced from its half-\u00admillion peak. They were soon replaced, however, by new refugees from the war in Syria \u2014 just a trickle at first, but by the end of 2014, their number was more than 600,000.In certain ways, Khulood found the Syrian children quite different from their Iraqi counterparts. \u201cThe Iraqis, because they had become so tired of war, they were very peaceful and easy to work with,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the Syrian children \u2014 the boys \u2014 they have this idea, \u2018We have to go back to Syria to fight.\u2019 They hear this constantly from their fathers \u2014 \u2018You\u2019re going to be a soldier and go back to Syria\u2019 \u2014 so they\u2019re like little rebels, not little kids. It\u2019s all about home, missing home, how they need to go back and avenge what happened.\u201d By contrast, the girls had far more in common. \u201cIn both Iraq and Syria, girls are taught to keep everything inside. They aren\u2019t listened to. This makes it much harder to reach them, so their problems are deeper.\u201dKhulood still hadn\u2019t given up on her quest to get her family out of the region. For several years, she continued to petition for the United States to reopen their case, but those efforts went nowhere. By 2014, she was holding out special hope for Britain; in Jordan, she had worked as an interpreter for a British film company, and with letters of support from her former co-\u00adworkers, Khulood reasoned, the authorities there might look favorably on her. She had recently become aware of a rather diabolical Catch-22, however. Nearly the only way to win asylum in Britain \u2014 or in any other country, for that matter \u2014 was to present the petition in person. To do that, Khulood first needed to obtain a British visa, and to get that, she needed to have legal residency in Jordan. \u201cAnd that\u2019s impossible,\u201d she said. \u201cJordan only gives residency to wealthy refugees who, of course, have no problem resettling in Europe anyway.\u201dStill, in April 2014, Khulood hadn\u2019t completely given up hope. Possessed of a seemingly unconquerable will, over several days of conversation, she seemed determined to put the very best face on her situation, and she was far more interested in talking up her current plans than her past failures. Only once did this brave facade crack, and it came amid a discussion about the future she imagined for the refugee children she worked with.\u201cI stay with this because I want these kids to have a better life than me,\u201d she said, \u201cbut frankly, I think their lives will be wasted just like mine. I try not to think that way, but, really, let\u2019s be candid: This is their future. For me, these past nine years have been wasted. My sisters and I, we have dreams. We are educated, we want to study, to have careers. But in Jordan we cannot legally work, and we cannot leave, so we are just standing in place. That\u2019s all. Now we\u2019re becoming old, we\u2019re all in our 30s, but still we can\u2019t marry or start families, because then we will never get out of here.\u201dKhulood sat back and let out a dispirited sigh. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I try to never pity myself or to blame anyone for this situation, but I really wish the Americans had thought more about what they were doing before they came to Iraq. That\u2019s what started all this. Without that, we would be normal.\u201dBut for Khulood and her sisters, the situation was about to grow even worse. In the autumn of 2014, Khulood said, KnK was having problems with the Jordanian government, which insisted that the organization\u2019s foreign staff members have legal work permits. While KnK said the sisters\u2019 work was exemplary, its efforts to keep them were in vain; that December, all three Zaidi sisters were dismissed from their jobs on the same day.EgyptSee Map\u201cThe idea wasn\u2019t to kill ourselves,\u201d Laila explained, \u201cbut to draw attention to what the Sisi regime was doing. It was the only weapon we had left.\u201d As for its efficacy, she was matter-\u00adof-\u00adfact. \u201cA few people passing signaled that they supported us \u2014 sometimes quite a subtle signal.\u201dAdding another layer of pain to the experience, it came at a time when Laila\u2019s family had, quite literally, disappeared before her eyes.The first sign that the Sisi regime was to take a much dimmer view than its predecessors of dissent to its rule came with Alaa\u2019s arrest in late November 2013. Rather than being released on bail to await trial, he and his 24 co-\u00addefendants were held for the next four months. In a tactic apparently designed to break his will, Alaa\u2019s release on bail in March 2014 was followed by his rearrest three months later.If average Egyptians were alarmed by the deepening repression in their country \u2014 less than a year after Sisi took power, there were already far more political prisoners in Egypt\u2019s jails than there had ever been under Mubarak \u2014 they gave scant evidence of it. In presidential elections that May, Sisi, now officially retired from the military, won with more than 96 percent of the vote. While this surely wasn\u2019t a wholly accurate reflection of his popularity \u2014 between those political parties that had been banned and those that boycotted the election, Sisi faced only token opposition \u2014 even an ardent opponent like Laila Soueif recognized that the former general had widespread support. She had even seen it among many of her friends and university co-\u00adworkers. \u201cThey had this idea that, \u2018O.K., maybe he\u2019s a little rough, but he saved us from the Islamists,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s all they cared about, all they saw.\u201dUp to that point, Laila\u2019s youngest daughter, Sanaa, then 20, had avoided the family tradition of run-ins with the law. On June 21, 2014, that changed. Increasingly infuriated by the treatment of her brother and Egypt\u2019s other political prisoners, Sanaa joined a human rights rally in Cairo. Within minutes, she was arrested on the same charge as her brother: violating the protest law.Even under the tightening Sisi regime, members of the Cairene upper class like Sanaa enjoyed a degree of immunity \u2014 the main enemies of the state, after all, were the working-\u00adclass followers of the Muslim Brotherhood, and they were to be ruthlessly hunted down. But when brought before a magistrate, the college student took a bold step. Despite suggestions from the judge that she stay quiet, Sanaa insisted that she had been a chief organizer of the demonstration and refused to sign her statement until this detail was included. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t going to let them do the usual thing of letting the high-\u00adprofile activists go and pound on the lesser-\u00adknown ones,\u201d Laila said. Sanaa, like her older brother, was held in jail pending trial.For Ahmed Seif, Egypt\u2019s pre-\u00ademinent human rights lawyer, it had meant that his ever-\u00adexpanding roster of clients now included two of his own children. At a news conference the previous January, the former political prisoner took the microphone to eloquently address his imprisoned son, Alaa. \u201cI wanted you to inherit a democratic society that guards your rights, my son, but instead I passed on the prison cell that held me, and now holds you.\u201d By June, that haunting message applied equally to his youngest daughter.Soon, matters took an even grimmer turn for the family of Laila Soueif. Long in frail health, Ahmed had been scheduled for open-\u00adheart surgery at the end of August; on the 16th of that month, he suddenly collapsed and then fell into a coma. Only after intense lobbying by both influential Egyptians and international human rights organizations did the Sisi regime grant Alaa and Sanaa afternoon furloughs to visit their father before he died.\u201cAnd that was the absolute worst day,\u201d Laila said, \u201cmaybe the worst day of my life. Sanaa was being held in a police station, so we had been able to see her and tell her what was going on, but Alaa had no idea. He showed up at the hospital with flowers for Ahmed, so I had to take him aside to say his father was in a coma. He said, \u2018So he won\u2019t even know I\u2019m here then\u2019 and just threw the flowers out.\u201dThe day after that hospital visit, Alaa went on a hunger strike in his cell. Sanaa stopped eating also, on Aug. 28, the day of her father\u2019s funeral. A week later, Laila and Mona announced their partial hunger strike, in which they would take only anti-\u00addehydration liquids.In light of both Ahmed\u2019s death and the family\u2019s prominence, many observers believed that Alaa and Sanaa would be shown leniency by the courts. That belief was misplaced. On Oct. 26, 2014, Sanaa was sentenced to three years in prison for violating the protest law. The next day, Laila and Mona took to the courthouse steps for their intensified hunger strike. Laila braced herself for more bad news when Alaa went to trial the following month, by remembering something her husband had said.\u201cBecause Ahmed had spent so much time in courtrooms and knew what certain things meant,\u201d she said, \u201che was always very accurate in his predictions. Before he died, when he was still representing Alaa, he told me, \u2018Prepare yourself, because they\u2019re going to give him five years.\u2019 \u201dSyriaSee MapWith the serial siege of Homs steadily grinding ever more of the city\u2019s neighborhoods to dust, by early 2014 even the Ibrahim family\u2019s shelter home was no longer safe. That March, the family moved once again, this time to New Akrama, a neighborhood that had been spared the worst of the violence. There, they simply waited along with everyone else for something, anything, to change.That change finally came in May, when the last of Homs\u2019 rebels accepted a brokered cease-fire and safe passage from the city. The three-year siege of Homs was over. What had once been a thriving, cosmopolitan city was now known as Syria\u2019s Stalingrad, with vast expanses of its neighborhoods uninhabitable. It was also only then that the full horror of what some of its residents had been subjected to came to light. In the total-war environment, some residents had starved to death, while others had survived by eating leaves and weeds.But even if a kind of peace had reached the shattered streets of Homs, the war continued elsewhere in Syria, and in a form that boded poorly for all its citizens. Majd Ibrahim heard the names of so many new militias competing with the plethora of already existing ones, it was quite impossible to keep track of them all. For sheer daring and cruelty, however, one group stood out: the Islamic State, or ISIS.An even more radical offshoot of Al Qaeda, the newcomers attracted Islamic extremists from around the world. In Syria, the group announced its presence with a series of sudden, brutal attacks in Aleppo and the desert towns to the east, battling not just the Syrian Army but also those rival militias it deemed \u201capostate.\u201d What most drew the attention of Majd Ibrahim was the group\u2019s reputation for complete mercilessness, for eliminating by the most horrific means possible any who would resist its will.Just a month after the Homs siege ended, most of the rest of the world would hear of ISIS, too, when it stormed out of the Syrian desert to utterly transform the Middle Eastern battlefield yet again.TKIraqSee MapBy the time he was a teenager, Wakaz had joined the legions of other unskilled young Iraqi men who scraped by with day-labor construction jobs: hauling bricks, cutting rebar, mixing cement. When no construction work was to be had, he sometimes helped out in the small candy shop that his father, a retired bank clerk, had opened in Dawr, his home village just outside Tikrit. But it was all a rather meager and dull existence.There was one potential way out. In stark contrast to Wakaz\u2019s own middling ability to find employment, his oldest brother, Mohammed, had been hired as an intelligence officer for the local security forces, and this sinecure held out considerable promise for the entire Hassan family. Given the culture of nepotism that Sad\u00addam Hussein had fostered in Iraq, and which continued to flourish after his demise, Wakaz could reasonably hope that Mohammed might someday work his way far enough up into the munici\u00adpal ranks to bring his three younger brothers, including himself, into the security forces as well. But in June 2014, a series of cataclysmic events were about to break over the Sunni heartland of Iraq, and they would radically alter the fortunes of the 19-year-old day laborer in Dawr.At the very beginning of that year, ISIS insurgents wrested control of the crucial crossroads city of Falluja in Iraq\u2019s Anbar Province, then spread out to seize a number of nearby cities and towns. At the time, Wakaz knew very little about the group, other than that it sought to establish an Islamic caliphate in the Sunni lands of Iraq and Syria. Over subsequent months, however, Wakaz, like most other young Tikriti men, had seen the elaborate recruitment videos that ISIS produced and distributed on social media. The videos depicted warriors, or \u201cknights,\u201d as ISIS called them, clad in smartly turned-out uniforms and black ski masks as they rode triumphantly through towns they had conquered, great black flags flapping from their new Toyota Land Cruisers. Other videos from that time showed a decidedly darker side of ISIS \u2014 executions and crucifixion displays \u2014 but Wakaz claimed never to have seen those. In any event, the budding caliphate seemed far away from the sleepy and economically moribund town of Dawr.By that June, it was far away no more. On June 6, a band of ISIS fighters entered the western suburbs of Mosul, northern Iraq\u2019s largest city, just 140 miles up Highway 1 from Tikrit. Although it\u2019s estimated that a mere 1,500 ISIS fighters participated in the attack on Mosul \u2014 and by some accounts, the number was far lower \u2014 within a couple of days, they had put the tens of thousands of Iraqi Army and security forces in the city of two million to panicked flight. By June 9, the Highway 1 bypass road around Tikrit was the scene of a frantic stampede as thousands of Iraqi soldiers, many having already shed their uniforms, sped for the safety of Baghdad, 100 miles farther south. But ISIS wasn\u2019t done. After Mosul, they quickly advanced on Baiji, the oil-refinery town 40 miles north of Tikrit, and then on June 11 rolled into Tikrit itself.In Tikrit, just as in Mosul and Baiji, the Iraqi Army offered virtually nothing in the way of resistance, with different units seeming only to compete on how quickly they could escape and how much of their weaponry they could leave behind for the enemy. But if the army fled the region, few of the local people did. Those remaining behind included Wakaz and his brother Mohammed.The ISIS offensive of June 2014 marked one of the most stunning military feats in modern history: In less than one week, a lightly armed guerrilla force of, ultimately, perhaps 5,000 fighters scattered a modern and well-equipped army at least 20 times its size, capturing billions of dollars worth of advanced weaponry and military hardware, and now controlled population centers that totaled some five million people. While such a colossal collapse as that experienced by the Iraqi Army must necessarily be a result of many failures \u2014 certainly, incompetence and corruption played major roles \u2014 much of it could be attributed to recent history.Under the eight-year rule of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, Iraq\u2019s Shiite majority had come to dominate most every aspect of the national government, including its military, and to lord their newfound primacy over the Sunnis. For many residents in the Sunni heartland \u2014 and this included Baiji and Tikrit \u2014 this heavy-handed treatment spawned a deep contempt for both the central government and its army, whom they regarded as occupiers. Of course, that Shiite-dominated army was well aware of the locals\u2019 contempt and deeply distrusted them in turn, to such an extent that at the first sign of trouble \u2014 in this case, a few Sunni jihadists riding into town vowing vengeance \u2014 the soldiers, fearing a mass uprising against them, simply bolted.This was not a completely unfounded fear, because ISIS had cleverly established sleeper cells in these cities ahead of time, both to begin attacks when the battle was joined and to recruit new members to the cause. Among those recruits was Wakaz Hassan.According to Wakaz, he joined ISIS on June 10, 2014, just as the guerrilla group became active in the Tikrit area but a full day before its attacks there began in earnest. His chief recruiter, he claimed, was none other than his brother, the 26-year-old American-trained and Iraqi-government-employed intelligence officer Mohammed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t for religion,\u201d Wakaz maintained, \u201cand it wasn\u2019t as if I had any emotional connection to the group \u2014 at that point, I didn\u2019t really know what they were fighting for \u2014 but because Mohammed said we should join.\u201dOmitted from Wakaz\u2019s account was the matter of money. By the summer of 2014, ISIS was so flush with funds from its control of the oil fields of eastern Syria that it could offer even untrained foot soldiers up to $400 a month for enlisting \u2014 vastly more than an unskilled 19-year-old like Wakaz could make from pickup construction jobs. Of course, having now also seized the Baiji oil refinery, ISIS stood to turn its financial spigot into a geyser.As pledging members of ISIS, Mohammed and Wakaz assisted in the seizing of Tikrit on June 11. The brothers also played at least a supporting role in the most horrific atrocity to occur during ISIS\u2019 June blitzkrieg.Just to the north of Tikrit is a large Iraqi military training base still known by its American name: Camp Speicher. Thousands of cadets were undergoing training there when ISIS closed in. As might have been predicted from the conduct of Iraqi soldiers elsewhere, the regular army units and senior military command garrisoned at Speicher simply fled the compound at word of ISIS\u2019 approach, leaving the students stranded. Wakaz said he helped round up the cadets but insists he played no role in what came next.After separating the trainees by sect \u2014 Sunni to one side, Shiite to the other \u2014 ISIS gunmen marched hundreds of the Shiite cadets to various spots around Tikrit to be machine-gunned, the mass murders dutifully videotaped by ISIS cameramen for posting on the internet. Traditionally, armies and guerrilla groups try to deny or minimize their war crimes, but not so with ISIS; when outside observers first estimated that 800 cadets were murdered that day in Tikrit, ISIS spokesmen boasted that they had actually killed many more. (The final death toll remains unknown, but estimates now range as high as 1,700.)After the Camp Speicher massacre, Wakaz signed up with ISIS for a one-year enlistment \u2014 for a terrorist organization, it has a surprisingly formal bureaucracy \u2014 and was ferried up Highway 1 with a large group of fellow recruits to an ISIS compound outside Mosul. There, he learned the rudimentary skills imparted to new soldiers everywhere: running obstacle courses, breaking down and firing various weapons, tactical drills on maintaining squad cohesion on the battlefield. But soon enough his training took a more brutal turn.On a morning in late June, Wakaz was summoned from his barracks by a senior commander. Instructing the 19-year-old to follow, the commander led Wakaz to a field at the edge of the compound. After a few moments, they were joined by two other men, an ISIS fighter and a civilian who appeared to be in his 30s. The civilian was blindfolded, with his hands tied behind his back, and he was crying. The ISIS fighter roughly forced the crying man to his knees, as the commander handed Wakaz a pistol. The former day laborer from Dawr knew precisely what was expected of him.\u201cThey showed me how to do it,\u201d Wakaz said. \u201cYou point the gun downward. Also to not shoot directly at the center of the head, but to go a little bit off to one side.\u201dIn the training-compound field, Wakaz dutifully carried out his first execution. Over the following few weeks, he was summoned to the field five more times, to murder five more blindfolded and handcuffed men. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about them,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I would say they ranged in age from about 35 to maybe 70. After that first one, only one other was crying. With the others, I think maybe they didn\u2019t know what was about to happen.\u201dWakaz related all this \u2014 even physically acted out how a proper killing was done \u2014 with no visible emotion. But then, as if belatedly realizing the coldbloodedness of his account, he gave a small shrug.\u201cI felt bad doing it,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I had no choice. Once we reached Mosul, there was no way to leave \u2014 and with ISIS, if you don\u2019t obey, they kill you too.\u201dKurdistanSee Map\u201cI don\u2019t really remember him that well, because I was only 8 when he died,\u201d Azar said. \u201cMy strongest memory is that there was just a constant parade of pesh merga commanders coming to our house, conferring with my father.\u201dFor nearly 30 years, Heso\u2019s remains were lost somewhere in the mountains of Kurdistan, but a few years ago Azar and his brothers began a monthslong quest to locate them. By talking with villagers and Heso\u2019s surviving companions, they finally found his bones at the bottom of a remote ravine.\u201cWe brought them back to our village, and he was given a hero\u2019s funeral,\u201d Azar said. \u201cEven Barzani was there\u201d \u2014 the K.R.G.\u2019s president, Massoud Barzani.The doctor\u2019s sense of personal loss was more evident when he talked of the death of his brother Ali, the second-oldest of the 14 Mirkhan siblings and the first to follow Heso into the ranks of pesh merga leadership. \u201cWhen Ali was killed, it was a tragedy not just for the family, but all Kurdistan,\u201d Azar said. \u201cHe was a natural leader of men \u2014 charismatic, brilliant \u2014 and, O.K., he was my brother, but I believe we would be in a very different place now if he had stayed alive. Many, many people who knew him have said this to me.\u201dAzar told me these stories on the drive described in the preface, perhaps in part to explain why our destination, a little village in Iraq called Gunde Siba, still haunted him. He was on an indefinite leave of absence from the hospital where he worked in Erbil, the K.R.G. capital, to devote all his energies to confronting the crisis caused by the ISIS invasion. His duties, which appeared to be largely self-determined, consisted of periodically touring the pesh merga front lines and advising its commanders. Everyone in the K.R.G., it seemed, knew the Mirkhan name, and one of its happier consequences was that its bearers could expect to be treated with immediate respect and deference.As we spoke, it became clear that Azar\u2019s self-appointed mission went far beyond confronting the threat of ISIS. He saw in the K.R.G.\u2019s current situation a precious and unprecedented opportunity to create a true Kurdish nation. To achieve that meant not just defeating the ISIS fanatics but ridding the land of the Kurds\u2019 historical enemies, the Arabs, once and for all. \u201cFor fourteen hundred years, they have sworn to destroy us,\u201d he said. \u201cAt what point do we take them at their word?\u201d To Azar, that point had now been reached. In his view, which is by no means a minority one in the K.R.G., the first task at hand is to sever the remaining vestiges of the Iraqi state \u2014 it is a point of pride with Azar that he doesn\u2019t speak Arabic and has only once been to Baghdad \u2014 and then to dismantle the legacy of forced Arab-Kurd integration initiated by Saddam Hussein.Part of the doctor\u2019s severity stems from what he regards as Kurdish complacency in the face of the dangers that lay all around, and it is further fueled by the tragedy he witnessed in Gunde Siba on Aug. 3, 2014.For 22 years after its creation in 1992, the K.R.G. was a relative oasis of stability and peace in the region, its ties to Baghdad ever more theoretical. That exempt status was most nakedly revealed during the American intervention in Iraq, in which the K.R.G. openly sided with the invaders, providing them with back bases and airfields from which to carry out the fight; as local officials are fond of pointing out, not a single coalition soldier was killed in the K.R.G. during the Iraq war. That calm continued through the steady disintegration of Iraq after the American withdrawal, as the K.R.G. became ever more reluctant to pay even lip service to affiliation with Baghdad. To the good citizens of the K.R.G., it increasingly appeared that their mountain enclave had somehow found a way to escape the maelstroms swirling around it, that the days of warrior families like the Mirkhans might go the way of folklore. That fanciful notion ended with ISIS\u2019 lightning advance into central Iraq in June 2014.\u201cI\u2019ve never trusted the Arabs, but as strange as it sounds, I trusted Daesh,\u201d Azar explained, using a common term for ISIS. \u201cIn the past, the Arabs always lied \u2014 \u2018Oh, you Kurds have nothing to fear from us\u2019 \u2014 and then they attacked us. But Daesh was absolutely clear what they were going to do. They wanted to take this part of the world back to the caliphate. They wanted to eliminate everyone who was not their kind \u2014 the Christians and the Kurds and the Shia \u2014 and they were absolutely open about it. After their June offensive, I had no doubt they were coming for us next.\u201d The doctor even pinpointed where they would strike first. \u201cAny fool looking at a map could know. It was going to be the Yazidis. It was going to be Sinjar.\u201dThe Yazidis are a Kurdish religious minority that ISIS had long excoriated as \u201cdevil worshipers\u201d and vowed to exterminate. Their Mount Sinjar heartland was in the far northwestern corner of Iraq and outside official K.R.G. territory, making them especially vulnerable. What\u2019s more \u2014 and this is what a glance at a map made obvious \u2014 with ISIS\u2019 capture of Mosul that June, the land link between the K.R.G. and the Yazidi Kurds in Sinjar was reduced to a single rutted farm road.In the days and weeks after the June offensive, Azar made use of his family name to compel meetings within his circle of civilian and military comrades. At each, he warned of the coming ISIS attack. \u201cNo one took it seriously,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThey all said, \u2018No, their fight is with the Shia in Baghdad, why would they come here?\u2019 \u201dOn Aug. 1, 2014, ISIS guerrillas attacked an isolated pesh merga outpost in the town of Zumar, which lay just 10 miles away from the last road into Sinjar. When still there was no sign of action by the government, in desperation Azar Mirkhan rustled up five or six of his pesh merga friends, and together they raced west.\u201cAnd this is as far as we got,\u201d Azar said. \u201cRight here.\u201dWe were standing on the shoulder of the road in Gunde Siba, just a few miles west of the Tigris River and still some 40 miles from the town of Sinjar. \u201cBy then, it was night, and right here we started meeting the pesh merga who had fled from Sinjar and, behind them, the Yazidi refugees. It was impossible to go on because the road was just jammed, everyone trying to escape. We set up a defense post here and rallied some of the pesh merga to stay with us, but this is as far as we got.\u201d He lit a cigarette and blew smoke into the air. \u201cWe were one day too late.\u201dIn Sinjar that day \u2014 Aug. 3 \u2014 ISIS began carrying out mass executions, a slaughter that would ultimately claim the lives of at least 5,000 Yazidis. They were also rounding up thousands of girls and women to be used as sex slaves. Tens of thousands more Yazidis were frantically scaling the flanks of Mount Sinjar in a bid to escape the killers. Of all this, Azar Mirkhan had only an intimation in the terror-stricken faces and anguished accounts of those survivors streaming into Gunde Siba.But Azar had little time to grasp, let alone address, the tragedy unfolding in Sinjar. Just two days later, ISIS began a second offensive, this one aimed directly at the K.R.G. capital city, Erbil. Turning back from Gunde Siba, the doctor raced south for the battlefield.As it happened, Azar\u2019s older brother Araz, 44, was the deputy commander of pesh merga forces along the very section of the K.R.G. frontier, Sector 6, that bore the brunt of the new ISIS assault. Azar immediately went into battle alongside his brother \u2014 but not just Araz. Most of Azar\u2019s other brothers had long since moved abroad as part of the Kurdish diaspora and had become doctors and engineers in the United States and Europe, but befitting the Mirkhan family\u2019s warrior-caste reputation, many of them set aside their businesses and medical practices to race to the K.R.G. and take up arms. At one point in that summer, five Mirkhan brothers, along with one of Azar\u2019s nephews, were fighting shoulder to shoulder at a Sector 6 firebase.\u201cIt was a good thing ISIS didn\u2019t drop a mortar on us right then,\u201d Azar joked. \u201cOur mother would have been upset.\u201dBut something did happen in the battle that changed Azar. After coming within 15 miles of Erbil, the ISIS advance stalled and was then thrown back by a furious pesh merga counteroffensive. During that counterattack on Aug. 20, an ISIS sniper\u2019s bullet shattered Azar\u2019s right hand. For weeks afterward, there was concern that he might lose the hand altogether, but surgery and physical therapy helped restore some function.\u201cThe important thing is that I can shoot a gun again now,\u201d Azar said, gently curling and uncurling his fingers. \u201cNot as well as before, but almost.\u201dSuspected members of ISIS held by Kurds at a prison in\u00a0Kani Goma, June 2015.Prisoner.

Majd was at work when he received a frantic phone call from his mother: There had just been an explosion at Akrama al-Makhzomeh, the school attended by Majd\u2019s 11-year-old younger brother, Ali, with reports of many casualties.His mother raced to the scene, but Majd was unable to leave work for another 90 minutes. The memory of what he saw when he finally arrived at the school cast the perennially cheerful Majd into a dark corner within himself, his eyes settling into a sad, distant stare.\u201cNever could I have imagined something like that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like a nightmare, the worst nightmare. Blood everywhere, parts of children, and they\u2019re everywhere around you, and you\u2019re walking through all this \u2014 you\u2019re stepping on body parts. ...\u201d He closed his eyes briefly, struggled to control his breathing. \u201cIt\u2019s something I can just never get out of my mind.\u201dIt was only when Majd learned the details of what happened, though, that he grasped the full savagery of the attack. Just as parents and rescuers began swarming into Akrama al-Makhzomeh in response to the first blast, from a car bomb, a suicide bomber tried to enter the school\u2019s main courtyard to kill more. Shut out by an alert guard, the bomber blew himself up at the front gate. When Majd\u2019s mother reached the bomb site, she found Ali hiding with a group of terrified classmates at the back of the school.The double bombing at Akrama al-Makhzomeh killed at least 45, including 41 schoolchildren. It was another reminder \u2014 as if the people of Homs needed one \u2014 that in the new Syria, no haven was truly safe, no place off-limits to the murderers. In its aftermath, the Ibrahim family, like almost everyone else in New Akrama, largely stayed indoors, venturing outside only when necessary.KurdistanSee MapA soldier called out a warning: An ISIS sniper had been spotted in the village an hour earlier, and, in his current stance, Azar made for a very easy target. The doctor gave the man an irritated look, then turned back to his binoculars.The firebase consisted of a series of hastily constructed berms and dugouts on a ridge line about three miles from the Tigris River, with ISIS in control of the lowlands below. In the time he spent here, Azar had survived several ISIS attacks.\u201cFirst, they send in their suicide bombers in armored Humvees. If you don\u2019t destroy them as they come up the hill \u2014 and you need to make a direct hit \u2014 they blast huge holes in the walls, because these are just massive explosions. Then in the confusion of that, they send in their infantry and, behind them, the snipers. It all happens very fast: Everything quiet, and then suddenly they\u2019re everywhere. The important thing is to stay calm, to pick your targets, because if you panic, you\u2019re finished. That\u2019s the problem with the Iraqi Army; they always panic.\u201dPanic didn\u2019t seem to figure prominently in Azar\u2019s range of emotions. \u201cI like fighting Daesh,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re actually quite smart. It\u2019s almost a kind of game.\u201dPerhaps not surprising in a people so implacably committed to establishing a homeland, the Kurds of the K.R.G. find it intolerable that ISIS should maintain dominion over any of their territory. Much as the United States Army will sustain more casualties in order to retrieve their battlefield dead, so the pesh merga have been willing to suffer higher losses to recover Kurdish ground more quickly.At Black Tiger Camp, the back-base command center of Sector 6, Sirwan Barzani, the overall sector commander, could point to the enormous color-coded battlefront map on his office wall and rattle off statistics remarkable in their specificity. \u201cWhen I first arrived here,\u201d he said, \u201cDaesh was just three kilometers down the road. Now we have cleared them for 23 kilometers to the west and 34 kilometers to the south. In my sector, we have retaken 1,100 square kilometers, but we still have about 214 square kilometers to go.\u201dBy May 2015, Barzani said, nearly 120 pesh merga had died in Sector 6, where the greatest ISIS incursions had occurred. At the same time, pesh merga commanders make an interesting distinction between where they are willing to suffer losses to regain land and where they aren\u2019t. For example, the ISIS-held village that Azar studied with his binoculars was inhabited by Arabs, not Kurds.\u201cSo even though it is on K.R.G. territory, it\u2019s not worth losing men for,\u201d he explained. \u201cNot until we\u2019re ready to do a much bigger offensive.\u201dBut when that offensive might come was a matter tied up with international geopolitics, and with the outcome of decisions being made in Washington and Brussels and Baghdad. In light of the woeful conduct of the Iraqi Army in the past \u2014 and absent any will to place significant numbers of Western troops on the ground \u2014 many American and European politicians and foreign-policy advisers were calling for deputizing the one fighting force in the region that had proved its mettle, the pesh merga, to lead the campaign to destroy ISIS. Less clear was whether anyone had seriously discussed this idea with the Kurds.\u201cYou know, the Americans come here, and they want to talk about retaking Mosul,\u201d Sirwan Barzani said. \u201cAre you going to do it with American troops? No. Are you going to do it with the Iraqi Army? No, because they\u2019re useless. So let\u2019s have the Kurds do it. But what do we want with Mosul? It\u2019s not Kurdistan; it\u2019s Iraq, and why should we lose more men for the sake of Iraq?\u201dAnimating that resistance, beyond the traditional Kurdish antipathy for the regime in Baghdad, was what the Iraqi Army collapse in 2014 brought down on the K.R.G. The Iraqis, by abandoning their American-supplied heavy weaponry and vehicles to ISIS \u2014 in most cases, they didn\u2019t even have the presence of mind to destroy it \u2014 had virtually overnight converted the guerrilla force into one of the best-equipped armies in the region, and it was the Kurds who paid the price.By May 2015, the Americans were still trying to cobble together a workable arrangement. The response time for airstrikes against ISIS targets had greatly improved because of the recent deployment of American aerial spotter teams in the K.R.G., but much slower going was the effort to forge some kind of rapprochement between the pesh merga and the Iraqi Army. Directly beside Barzani\u2019s Black Tiger Camp in Gwer was a smaller base where Iraqi soldiers were receiving American training. \u201cI pray for the day I don\u2019t have to see that anymore,\u201d Barzani said, pointing to the Iraqi flag flying from the adjacent base.But Black Tiger Camp revealed something else about the K.R.G., an aspect of the society that most of its officials, whether civilian or military, try to play down or avoid speaking about altogether. For the entire time of its existence \u2014 and indeed, far predating that \u2014 the K.R.G. has been riven into two feuding camps, a schism that led to open civil war in the 1990s. On the surface, it has the trappings of a political duel between its two main parties, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (K.D.P.) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (P.U.K.), but in actuality, it is a contest between two great tribal groupings, the Barzani and the Talabani. The territory\u2019s north is thoroughly dominated by the Barzanis and their tribal allies \u2014 the Mirkhans among them \u2014 virtually all of whom are K.D.P. Southern K.R.G., by contrast, is controlled by the Talabanis and their tribal allies under the P.U.K. label.The feudalistic nature of this arrangement was on display at Black Tiger. All of the pesh merga at the camp, and along the entire 75-mile front of Sector 6, are \u201cBarzanis,\u201d as denoted by their red-and-white tribal scarves. In the Talabani sectors of southern K.R.G., the pesh merga scarves are black and white.Further, Sirwan Barzani is the \u201ccommander\u201d of Sector 6 less through any military acumen on his part \u2014 before the war, he was the extremely wealthy owner of a cellphone-service provider \u2014 than through the fact that he is the nephew of the K.R.G.\u2019s president, Massoud Barzani, who in turn is the son of the legendary Kurdish warlord Mustafa Barzani. This also explains Sirwan\u2019s impolitic frankness with a foreign journalist; as a full-fledged Barzani, he is quite beyond the reach of more temperate but lesser-named K.R.G. politicians to muzzle.This enduring schism has had tragic consequences. In the first days of the ISIS advance into the K.R.G., the pesh merga\u2019s performance was extremely shaky, and as much as they wish to fix blame for that on the collapse of the Iraqi Army, an enormous contributing factor was that there were actually two pesh mergas, with little in the way of coordination between them. ISIS took advantage of that to nearly capture the K.R.G. capital, Erbil, and to start their extermination campaign against the Yazidis.Time and again in the K.R.G., I detected a sense of guilt, even of shame, when conversation turned to the fate of the Yazidis. With no one, though, did I sense it more than with Azar Mirkhan. Part of that may have stemmed from his having tried to aid them at their critical hour, only to discover that the hour had come and gone. But on a philosophical level, he also felt the Kurds had betrayed their history.\u201cYou could say that, in many ways, the Yazidis are the pure Kurds,\u201d he explained. \u201cTheir religion is what all Kurds believed at one time, not all this Shia-Sunni business. Everyone else changed, but they stayed true to the faith.\u201dAlong with his touring of the battlefronts, Azar has spent a great deal of time at the Yazidi displaced-persons camps in northern K.R.G., often working with a Kurdish-Swedish doctor named Nemam Ghafouri. These camps \u2014 some run by small independent charities, some by large international relief organizations \u2014 are home to tens of thousands of the Yazidis who outran the ISIS advance of August 2014, but when I visited in May 2015, they were being joined by a handful of others who had recently either escaped or been ransomed out from ISIS control. Despite having interviewed countless war and atrocity survivors across the world over the years, I found something uniquely horrifying about these returnees\u2019 stories. It took me some time to realize this was because of what was left unsaid, the need to puzzle out the depravity to which they were subjected.ISIS had used rape and sexual slavery as a weapon of war to destroy the fabric of Yazidi society, and now that some of these girls and women were returning, the conservative Yazidi honor code didn\u2019t permit them to speak of what happened to them. In the company of Ghafouri, I met a 10-year-old girl whose extended family had raised $1,500 \u2014 the savings of several lifetimes \u2014 to buy her freedom the week before. She said her ISIS owners had only made her clean and wash their clothes, that they never touched her, and this was a story the family was determined to believe. I met two teenage girls who had escaped from ISIS after one month, along with a relative whom I took to be their mother \u2014 she looked perhaps 45 years old, but a very hard 45: sunken cheeks, missing teeth, graying hair \u2014 who had been held for eight months. Except this woman wasn\u2019t their mother; she was their older sister, and she was only 24. By her account, she had feigned deafness, which is seen by ISIS as a sign of mental illness, and in this way she, too, avoided being molested. As Ghafouri explained, her mission now was to come up with some pretext to see the 10-year-old girl and the 24-year-old woman alone. After winning their trust, she would conduct a physical examination. If they had, in fact, been raped, she would inform their families that they had some sort of infection and needed to be placed in a special hospital \u2014 no visitors \u2014 for a week.\u201cSo then they are taken to Erbil,\u201d she explained. \u201cThey have the reconstruction \u2014 it\u2019s actually a simple operation \u2014 and they come back as virgins. Then they can be accepted back; they can marry someday. Of course it means they can never talk about what happened. They must keep it inside forever. But this is what passes for a happy ending now.\u201dHearing such testimonials has further hardened Azar Mirkhan\u2019s beliefs about what needs to be done if the Kurds are ever to find safety. In his view, ISIS was only the latest in a long line of implacable Arab enemies. \u201cIf this was the first time, then maybe you could say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s this horrible group of terrorists.\u2019 But this has been going on for our entire history. I can promise you that when we retake Sinjar, we will go there and we will find that the Arabs stayed with ISIS,\u201d Azar said. \u201cO.K., some are here in the camps, but many more stayed. So that is why I say our enemy is not just ISIS; it\u2019s all Arabs.\u201dSinjar, Iraq, November 2015.Azar Mirkhan near Sinjar, November 2015.Pesh merga front line, northern Iraq, May 2015.Arbat, a refugee camp near Sulaimaniya, Iraq, June 2015.Arbat, June 2015.A Yazidi refugee camp near Duhok, Iraq, May 2015.Azar Mirkhan (left) at a pesh merga camp near Mosul, Iraq, May 2015.Azar Mirkhan being shown ISIS-held positions in and around Sinjar, May 2015.Azar Mirkhan at a front-line position in Sinjar, May 2015.IraqSee MapPart of his reason may have involved economics; with ISIS\u2019 salad days clearly over, Wakaz\u2019s pay packet often arrived late. But it most likely was rooted even more in self-preservation. Because, slowly but surely, the tide appeared to be turning against ISIS.This was made evident to Wakaz as he contemplated just where he might go to start over. In April, the Iraqi Army, supported by American airstrikes, had recaptured Tikrit, and by that June they were closing ever tighter around Baiji. That still left Mosul and the ISIS-controlled towns in Anbar Province, but life in any of those places for an ex-ISIS fighter was sure to be grim: He would be resented by his former comrades, and a dead man should the Iraqi Army take control.Wakaz finally settled on a very different destination: the Kurdish-controlled Iraqi city of Kirkuk.Just as in Mosul and Baiji and Tikrit, the Iraqi Army garrisoned in Kirkuk broke and fled before the ISIS offensive a year earlier. But there the similarities ended. Racing to fill the void left by the Iraqis, thousands of pesh merga soldiers had poured into Kirkuk just ahead of ISIS and managed to throw back their advance. Ever since, Kirkuk has effectively been under Kurdish control, but the melting-pot city was also teeming with both Sunni and Shiite refugees, making it a natural hide-out for both active and former Islamist fighters. Although Kirkuk was a mere 60 miles from Baiji, the two cities were now separated by the heavily fortified line of the pesh merga army. It meant that, to reach his sanctuary city, Wakaz would have to travel the ISIS \u201cratline.\u201dSyria \u2022 GreeceSee MapJust days after his graduation, Majd\u2019s parents handed their son $3,000 \u2014 all the savings they had left \u2014 and told him to leave the country.\u201cTo them it was no longer about patriotism or defending the country,\u201d he said, \u201cbut about my staying alive.\u201d He gave a faint smile. \u201cPlus, I would have made a terrible soldier.\u201dOn June 21, Majd\u2019s father escorted him to Damascus, where two days later he caught a flight for Turkey. Besides the $3,000, all Majd carried was whatever could fit into his small knapsack.Hoping to stay at least somewhat near home, Majd began looking for work in Turkey. When that proved futile, he saw no choice but to join the migrant trail being negotiated by hundreds of thousands of his countrymen that summer, and so he headed west for Turkey\u2019s Aegean coast, where he might seek passage to Europe. Along the way, he serendipitously met up with an old friend from Homs whom he hadn\u2019t seen in years, Amjad, who was traveling with Ammar, another refugee from Homs. The three became a traveling team. Consequently, they shared the same overcrowded inflatable raft that, on the night of July 27, made the passage from a smuggler\u2019s beach near Bodrum, a Turkish resort town, to Kos, a Greek island several miles away.There, Majd and his two friends endured an agonizing wait. With Kos overwhelmed by tens of thousands of would-be migrants, Greek authorities were taking up to 10 days simply to issue the registry papers that would allow their onward travel. That summer, the migrant route through Eastern Europe was becoming increasingly inhospitable, with several governments threatening to shut it down completely. Finally, Majd and his friends received their papers late on the afternoon of Aug. 4. That left them just enough time to catch the nightly ferry for the Greek mainland, the beginning of their search for refuge somewhere in Europe.TKIraq \u2022 Syria \u2022 TurkeySee MapEver since ISIS gained strength in eastern Syria in early 2014, there have been accusations that their success relied on Turkey\u2019s keeping its border deliberately porous so that Islamist fighters from around the world might pass back and forth. That charge was made most explicitly by the Russian government in late 2015. While the Turkish administration of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vehemently denied the charge, evidence supports the Russian account. Eleven of nearly two dozen captured ISIS fighters that I interviewed for this report claimed to have transited through Turkey at some point during their ISIS service. Nearly all of those 11 told me they encountered Turkish soldiers or police while crossing the Turkish-Syrian frontier and were simply waved through. That was certainly the experience of Wakaz.\u201cThe man who was leading us, he went up to the Turkish checkpoint and talked to the guards for a few minutes,\u201d Wakaz said. \u201cMaybe he gave them some money, I don\u2019t know, but then we just passed on.\u201dAs to whether there was any chance the Turkish border guards didn\u2019t grasp the affiliation of those they were letting through, Wakaz briskly shook his head. \u201cOf course they knew. We were all young guys, and the man taking us across was Daesh. He went across there all the time. They knew.\u201dFrom Turkey, Wakaz made another clandestine crossing into K.R.G. territory, and by the beginning of July 2015, two weeks after he left ISIS, he was in Kirkuk and ready for a fresh start. He was soon joined there by another ISIS retiree, his brother Mohammed.At least initially, it seemed the Hassan brothers had chosen well. In Kirkuk, they moved into a small apartment in a neighborhood favored by other ex-ISIS fighters trying to escape notice, and within a week, both brothers found work on a nearby construction site. At that point, if Wakaz had a dream for the future, it was simply to lie low in Kirkuk, save as much money as possible, return home when the situation permitted and open his own small shop.As modest and heavily conditional as that dream was, it ended on the afternoon of Sept. 7, 2015, when a black car pulled alongside Wakaz on a Kirkuk street. Rolling down his window, the man in the front passenger seat, an undercover policeman, asked the young man with the piercing eyes for his identification card.Refugees off Lesbos Island, September 2015.Refugees landing on Lesbos, September 2015.Refugees waiting to register with the Greek police in Mytilini, the capital city of Lesbos, September 2015.Refugees in Mytilini, September 2015.Refugees in Mytilini, September 2015.Refugees outside the police booth in Mytilini, September 2015.Refugees waiting to register in Mytilini, September 2015.A clash between Syrian and Afghan refugees in Mytilini,\u00a0September 2015.A Syrian collapsing in the heat in Mytilini, September 2015.Refugees in Mytilini, September 2015.Refugees in Mytilini, September 2015.Refugees reaching Lesbos, November 2015.Refugees landing on Lesbos, November 2015.Walking toward Mytilini, November 2015.Walking to Mytilini, November 2015.The body of a migrant, Lesbos, November 2015.Refugees landing at Kos Island, August 2015.A tourist beach on Kos, August 2015.Kos, August 2015.Kos, August 2015.Kos, August 2015.GermanySee MapFrom Greece, the Syrian friends had traveled the migrant trail through Eastern Europe and reached southern Germany by mid-August. Majd had intended to continue on alone to Sweden, where he\u2019d heard winning asylum was easiest, but those plans were dashed when the friends were pulled off a northbound train by the police. After being shunted between migrant holding facilities, they were taken to Dresden in mid-September.For refugees from Homs to find themselves in Dresden held a certain paradox. The city, known for having been largely destroyed by Allied bombing in World War II, was also the center of the growing anti-immigration movement that had spread across Germany over the previous year. Right-wing nationalists were staging mass demonstrations in the city every Monday night. When I visited Majd, it had been just a week since terrorist attacks in Paris killed 130, and anger against migrants \u2014 and especially any from Muslim countries \u2014 was reaching a fever pitch.\u201cThere have been quite a few incidents here just this past week,\u201d Majd told me. \u201cA lot of the guys won\u2019t go to the city center at all right now.\u201dCertainly they wouldn\u2019t be heading downtown that evening, a Monday, when the anti-immigrant speeches in Dresden\u2019s Theaterplatz would kick off promptly at 7.Majd spoke frequently of his intention to return to Syria; an intention that partly explained why he asked for his face not to be shown in his portrait. That afternoon I asked if he could foresee a time when such a return would be possible. He thought for a long time. \u201cMinimum, 10 years from now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a saying in Syria: \u2018Blood brings blood.\u2019 Now everyone will want to take revenge for what has been done to them these past years, so it will just go on and on. Blood brings blood. I don\u2019t think it will end until everyone who has taken up a gun in this war is dead. Even if the killing speeds up, that will still take at least 10 years.\u201dBy coincidence, I was with Majd the following day, when, returning to his communal apartment, he found a letter awaiting him. It was from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees, and it informed Majd that a background check had been completed and that no problems were found; it was the last major hurdle in his petition for residency, making it all but certain that he would now be allowed to stay in Germany for the next three years. Setting the letter aside, Majd crossed to one of the attic\u2019s dormer windows and sat, staring out at the street, for a long time.Jordan \u2022 Greece \u2022 GermanySee MapWith Ali al-Zaidi\u2019s health too precarious to withstand the rigors of a hard journey, it was decided that Sahar would remain with him in Amman while Khulood and Teamim made for Europe. On Dec. 4, they took a flight to Istanbul and from there followed the by-now well-worn migrant trail down the Turkish coast to Izmir. After arranging to pay a smuggler 2,000 euros for spots aboard a boat, the sisters waited. The summons finally came on the night of Dec. 11.They were driven an hour and a half down the coast. Slipping to the shoreline in the darkness, Khulood and Teamim clambered aboard a severely overloaded rubber raft \u2014 Khulood counted at least 30 other passengers, rather than the eight or 10 it was designed to hold \u2014 which then pushed off for the Greek island of Samos, a three-hour journey.The overburdened raft lay so low in the water that twice the outboard motor died when waves broke over it. But the greatest danger came when they nearly reached safety. On the murky sliver-moon night, the pilot misgauged his approach to the Samos beach and smashed the raft against a rock outcropping; instantly, one of the air-filled pontoons began to collapse. Ready to join the other passengers tumbling into the water from the sinking boat \u2014 fortunately, all wore life preservers \u2014 Khulood thought to glance over at Teamim. Her oldest sister sat stock-still, too paralyzed with fear to react.\u201cI yelled at her to jump,\u201d Khulood recalled, \u201cbecause the waves were very high and they were going to smash us against the rocks, but she just couldn\u2019t move. I saw that she was going to die, but I thought, We\u2019ve come too far together, we must now share our fate.\u201dClambering over to her sister, Khulood grabbed Teamim and somehow managed to get them both clear of the sinking vessel and onto the rocks. There they were promptly knocked down by another wave, with Teamim badly hurting her leg in the fall, but at least they were now on land. In the dark, Khulood helped her limping sister up the hillside to join the rest of the migrants as they set out in search of shelter.The following two weeks became a blur of travel and waiting and tension for the two sisters from Iraq, an object lesson in both the callous indifference of officialdom and in the life-altering kindness of strangers. After registering with Greek authorities in Samos, the sisters were allowed to board a ferryboat for the Greek mainland and Athens, where they were sheltered by a friend of a friend. With the situation at the Eastern European frontiers changing constantly \u2014 and not in any way that augured well for the thousands of migrants still streaming north \u2014 the sisters quickly moved on. By Dec. 22, through a combination of bus, train and foot travel, Khulood and Teamim had crossed five European borders to finally reach southern Germany.There, their luck appeared to run out. Arrested shortly after crossing the German frontier, the sisters were held in jail until dark, then sent back into Austria and instructed to make for a refugee holding center in Klagenfurt. That camp was overflowing, however, and they were denied entry. With nowhere else to go, Khulood and Teamim simply huddled together outside the camp\u2019s gates \u2014 and then it began to snow.Their salvation was arranged through social media. After Khulood posted notice of her situation on Facebook, a small international band of activists mobilized in search of someone in the Klagenfurt area who might help the sisters. That aid soon arrived in the form of a local Green member of Parliament, who took Khulood and Teamim to a cafe to eat and warm up. At the cafe, the politician also sent out an urgent message seeking a local family who might temporarily take in the sisters; within an hour, he had received eight offers. From the cafe, the Zaidi sisters were taken to the home of Elisabeth and Erich Edelsbrunner.\u201cToday is the first day we feel comfortable and relaxed,\u201d Khulood emailed a friend in England the following day, Christmas Eve. \u201cThe family is very nice. They have given us our own room. They have a very lovely dog. I love him.\u201dIraqSee MapAfter his arrest, Wakaz quickly confessed to having been an ISIS fighter. He provided details of his service, including the six executions he carried out in Mosul. Whether this confession was coerced through torture was impossible to know \u2014 in conversation with me in the prison, Wakaz insisted that the Asayish interrogators hadn\u2019t mistreated him in any way, but even tortured prisoners tend to say that when their captors are standing over them. Over the course of our two long interviews, the young man sometimes contradicted himself, perhaps a result of trying to gauge what his questioner and captors might want to hear. That said, there seemed a core candor to his words that perhaps was at least partly because of a stricken conscience.\u201cI did bad things,\u201d he told me, \u201cand I need to confess to them before God.\u201dShortly after his arrest, Wakaz also informed on his brother Mohammed. It took Asayish a month to track down the older Hassan sibling, and he was being held in a different prison near Kirkuk. There had been no contact between the brothers since their arrests, but Wakaz hoped Mohammed was also making a clean slate of things. His main goal now, he said, was to atone for his crimes by helping the authorities identify whichever of his former ISIS colleagues were still alive. \u201cIf I had a chance to do it over again,\u201d he said, \u201cI never would have joined Daesh. I saw the evil things they did, and I know now that they aren\u2019t true Muslims.\u201dDespite this professed change of heart, the 21-year-old is cleareyed about his future. \u201cI have no illusions, and I have no hope,\u201d he told me. \u201cI believe I will spend the rest of my life in prison.\u201dBut Wakaz was basing that belief on the fact that he had been captured by K.R.G. investigators and remained in Kurdish custody. In reality, a grimmer future was being planned for Wakaz, one plainly laid out to me by a senior Asayish officer at the secret prison.Since the events of June 2014 \u2014 when the Iraqi Army in Kirkuk melted away before the ISIS assault, and the Kurds rushed unto the breach \u2014 the city has technically been under the joint control of the Iraqis and the Kurds. But this collaboration exists largely on paper. In practice, the Kurdish authorities have little faith in their Iraqi counterparts and see even less reason to cooperate with them on security matters. Nowhere is this separation more evident than on issues relating to ISIS.\u201cThat\u2019s why we haven\u2019t told the Iraqis about the guys in here,\u201d explained the Asayish official. \u201cIf we did, they would demand we hand them over, since most of their crimes were committed on Iraqi territory. Then they would either kill these guys outright or, if some of them are high enough up in the Daesh leadership to arrange a bribe, let them go. We just can\u2019t trust the Iraqis at all.\u201d In light of that, the Asayish plan is to keep Wakaz under wraps and to use him to identify other ISIS fighters they capture and with whom he might have served in the field. Once his usefulness to Asayish comes to an end \u2014 and that may not be until after the retaking of Mosul and the trove of ISIS fighters expected to surrender there \u2014 Wakaz will be handed over to the Iraqi authorities. At that point, his future will be short and preordained.\u201cHe thinks his life will be saved because we have him, and he knows we don\u2019t execute,\u201d the Asayish officer said. \u201cBut Iraq does. The Iraqis will try him in their courts, and they will give him a death sentence. Then they will transfer him to a prison in Iraq to be hanged.\u201dWhen I asked if there was any chance that, because of Wakaz\u2019s assistance in unmasking other ISIS fighters, a judge might show leniency in his case, the Asayish officer quickly shook his head. Or that he could somehow cut a deal to spare his life? The officer pondered briefly, then shook his head even more forcefully.\u201cIf he was senior Daesh, maybe,\u201d he said. \u201cBut he is a nobody and poor. So no. No chance.\u201dEgyptSee MapBy then, Alaa was approaching the one-year mark of a five-year prison sentence, just as his father, now deceased, had predicted. It was a high price for speaking out, and one of the awful paradoxes Alaa faced \u2014 along with thousands of other political prisoners in Egypt today \u2014 was that the old way of appealing to Cairo on human rights issues no longer worked. In the Mubarak era, if enough pressure was brought to bear by the American government and Western activist groups, an Egyptian political prisoner was likely to be quietly released. If General Sisi took away any lesson from Mubarak\u2019s downfall, though, it was to never be viewed as the West\u2019s lap dog. Western pressure applied today has little effect and might even be counterproductive.\u201cBut of course, you also can\u2019t stay quiet about it,\u201d Laila said, \u201cbecause this is exactly what they want. You have to keep trying, even if it seems futile.\u201dThe obduracy of the Sisi regime on human rights has undoubtedly been compounded by a new economic reality. Today, the annual American subsidy to Egypt is less than $1.3 billion, down from more than $2 billion in Mubarak\u2019s heyday. At the same time, Saudi Arabia and other gulf states have subsidized the Egyptian government with an estimated $30 billion since Sisi took power, and given the Saudis\u2019 own record on such matters, they seem unlikely to pester their client state over issues like political prisoners or freedom of expression. The simple fact is that the West in general, and the United States in particular, now has less influence over the Egyptian state than at any time since the early 1970s.Laila derives some perverse hope from the recent economic deterioration of Egypt, a decline so rapid and deep that it might, she believes, finally erode all remaining confidence in the present regime. \u201cSisi still has pools of support,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it\u2019s getting smaller all the time. The situation is really unsustainable now.\u201d But in March 2016, there were scant signs in Cairo or elsewhere in Egypt that any serious dissident movement was in the offing. \u201cNo, it won\u2019t happen today, and it won\u2019t be like Tahrir,\u201d Laila said. \u201cI give it 18 months. In 18 months, either there will be a kind of palace coup \u2014 the generals put Sisi to one side and bring in someone more moderate \u2014 or we will come to a new wave of widespread protest. If that happens, it won\u2019t be like 2011. This time, it will be far more violent.\u201dThe Sisi regime shows few signs of being worried. A second case against Alaa, for criticizing the justice system on his Facebook page, is currently in court. He faces the possibility of another sentence of six months to three years. Even if prosecutors drop that case, Laila will be 64 when her son is released.Mourners after an ISIS bombing, which killed at least 300, in the Karrada district of Baghdad, July 2016.The site of the Karrada district bombing, July 2016.Karrada district, July 2016.Karrada district, July 2016.A Shiite shrine that ISIS attacked, killing nearly 40 people, in Balad, July 2016.Balad, July 2016.Victims of the Balad attack, July 2016.Falluja, shortly after it was recaptured from ISIS, July 2016.The body of an ISIS fighter in Falluja, July 2016.An abandoned ISIS prison in Falluja, July 2016.A mosque that ISIS used as an arms depot, after an American airstrike, in Tikrit, July 2016.Refugees in Tulul al-Baq, July 2016.Refugees in Tulul al-Baq, July 2016.A refugee processing center in Hajjaj, July 2016.Refugees in Hajjaj, July 2016.Refugees in Hajjaj, 2016.Refugees in Tikrit, July 2016.Refugees in Tikrit, July 2016.\u00a0A refugee suffering heatstroke in Hajjaj, July 2016.Hajjaj, July 2016.Refugees, fleeing ISIS-held territory, near Hajjaj, July 2016.A camp for internally displaced people, Baghdad, July 2016.Hajjaj, July 2016.Hajjaj, July 2016.Refugees in Tulul al-Baq, July 2016.Tikrit, July 2016.KurdistanSee Map\u201cThey\u2019re on the high ground? How was that allowed?\u201d Azar stared darkly at the farmhouses for a moment, seething at the Arab encroachment, then slowly turned his gaze to the village center. No residents were visible, but here and there old cars were parked in the shadow of walls.\u201cYou see? Until two weeks ago, Daesh controlled this village, and the people living here had no problem with them, they stayed throughout. We lost four pesh merga here.\u201d Azar turned to me with his lopsided, grim smile. \u201cYou know what I would do? I would go to an Arab and ask to borrow his bulldozer. Then I\u2019d bring in an Israeli adviser \u2014 they\u2019re very good at this sort of thing \u2014 and in two or three days, I would erase this place.\u201dAzar has a flair for the outrageous statement, and I sometimes found it hard to know how serious he really was in such moments. But on that morning, I suspected he was quite sincere. It was Nov. 27, 2015, six months after my first visit with Azar, and we were on a back road to Sinjar, the Yazidi town that ISIS had so thoroughly savaged in the summer of 2014. In the intervening months, Azar had occasionally driven out to the pesh merga front-line trench above Sinjar to try his hand at shooting ISIS fighters \u2014 occupying an opposing trench just 40 yards away \u2014 but the pesh merga, with the help of massive American airstrikes, had recently recaptured the town itself. Azar had participated in the battle, and this return trip put him in a dark mood.His ill temper only deepened when we reached Sinjar. Much of the town, home to perhaps 100,000 before the war, had been reduced to rubble. While still checking for booby-traps, the pesh merga had cleared a narrow path through the ruins, and here and there lay the putrefying remains of a few ISIS fighters. So great was the damage to Sinjar that it was initially difficult to differentiate between what had been destroyed by the marauding ISIS warriors during their occupation and what had been leveled in the battle two weeks earlier, but a pattern emerged. In the small traffic circle at the center of town, ISIS had destroyed the minaret that stood there for more than 800 years. They also razed every Yazidi temple in Sinjar, along with its one Christian church. The hospital in the center of town still stood, but only because ISIS converted it into a sniper\u2019s nest and barracks, knowing that American warplanes wouldn\u2019t bomb it. Even so, they had taken the time to destroy all the medical equipment, even stomping on thermometers and glass ampuls.It was in Sinjar\u2019s residential neighborhoods, however, that ISIS\u2019s policy of ethnic cleansing took on an Old Testament air. On street after street, some houses remained perfectly intact, alongside others reduced to piles of broken masonry and twisted rebar. What most of the surviving houses had in common were spray-painted messages on their exterior walls, each something to the effect of \u201cAn Arab family lives here.\u201d Azar insisted that these were written not by the ISIS invaders but by the families themselves.\u201cThis was their message to Daesh,\u201d he said. \u201c \u2018Spare us, we are with you, we aren\u2019t Kurds.\u2019 And just like in that village, the Arabs stayed here throughout.\u201dThose Arab residents were now gone, having fled when American airstrikes signaled the coming battle. On several of the residential streets, some of the few Yazidis who had returned were picking their way through the Arab homes, loading looted bedding and furniture into pickup trucks.\u201cAnd why not?\u201d Azar said. \u201cThey have lost everything.\u201dIt all became far more visceral and ghastly when two pesh merga fighters led us to a barren field a short distance out of town, near the new front lines. At the far end of the field, pesh merga engineers were cutting a tank trench \u2014 ISIS remained just a few miles to the south \u2014 but farther up, three irregular mounds flanked a seasonal water runoff. From these mounds protruded the telltale evidence of a killing field: human bones and skulls, dirt-encrusted shoes, loops of tied cloth that had been blindfolds. In the rains over the previous 15 months, some of the remains of the mass graves had leached out, so that the dry streambed was littered with women\u2019s clothes, more shoes, teeth. None of the graves had been excavated yet \u2014 the authorities were waiting for a criminal forensics team \u2014 but by best estimates, this had been the execution ground for about 300 Yazidis, most of them women too elderly to be of sex-slave interest to ISIS or children too young to be put to any use.For a half-hour, Azar walked among the graves in silence, but I noticed he was becoming increasingly agitated and then that he was crying. I drew alongside to ask if he was O.K., if he wanted to leave. He abruptly wheeled to point a finger at the steeply rising flank of Mount Sinjar, maybe four miles to the north.\u201cThe pesh merga were right up there,\u201d the doctor said, his voice ragged with rage. \u201cDaesh brought them out here to kill so that we could watch. They thought about it. They did it deliberately, to humiliate us.\u201dReturning to the center of Sinjar, Azar strode briskly into the town hall, one of the few downtown structures still habitable, and motioned for a senior official to follow him out to the terrace. For the next hour, the two men huddled in deep conversation, waving away any pesh merga underlings who thought to approach. Afterward, Azar apologized to me for having taken so long.\u201cI told him that he needed to destroy all the Arab homes here,\u201d he recounted, \u201cbut he was hesitant. He thinks it\u2019s better to give them to the Yazidis who return, but I said, \u2018No; eventually some of those Arabs will come back with their titles and deeds and try to reclaim the houses, so better to just destroy them, leave nothing for them to come back to and start over again.\u2019 He understands that now.\u201dWhen I asked if he thought the official would actually follow through with the plan, Azar nodded. \u201cHe promised me. I made him promise.\u201dThat afternoon, we climbed the hairpin road that led out of town and up Mount Sinjar, the same path that tens of thousands of terrorized Yazidis had taken in their panicked flight of August 2014. All along the shoulders of the road were clumps of the clothes, faded and torn, that they cast aside as they ran.\u201cThere used to be a lot more,\u201d Azar muttered as he looked at the detritus. \u201cIt used to be everywhere.\u201dCresting the mountain, we entered a broad valley plateau that extended for the next 25 miles. Scattered over the land were the tent encampments of thousands of Yazidi families that still had no homes to return to. The historic heart of Yazidi society wasn\u2019t the lowlands these people had so recently fled, but rather the very mountain on which they were now camped, and on the hillsides all around their tent cities were the remnants of their ancestral villages, old abandoned crop terraces and crumbling earthen homes. Some of these settlements had been inhabited for nearly a thousand years, but in the 1970s Saddam Hussein sent his soldiers in to destroy them as part of his anti-Kurd campaign. The mountain Yazidis had then been herded down to the lowlands where they could be more easily watched \u2014 and, of course, more easily slaughtered when ISIS rolled in four decades later.Until a short time ago, Azar might have been derided as a xenophobe, even a fascist, for his radical separatist views. In seeing the results of ISIS\u2019s barbarism, however, and in contemplating the hatreds that have been unleashed across the Middle East in the past few years, some observers have begun to believe that his hard way of thinking might offer the best \u2014 or, more accurately, only \u2014 path out of the morass. The despair over how impossible it seems to reassemble the shattered nations of the region has caused an ever-increasing number of diplomats and generals and statesmen to consider just the sort of ethnic and sectarian separation that Azar advocates, albeit in less brutal form. Coincidentally, the model they most often look to for how it can be done right is the Kurdistan Regional Government.For 25 years, the K.R.G. has existed as a stable quasidemocracy, part of Iraq in name only. Perhaps the answer is to replicate that model for the rest of Iraq, to create a trifurcated nation rather than the currently bifurcated one. Give the Sunnis their own \u201cSunni Regional Government,\u201d with all the accouterments the Kurds already enjoy: a head of state, internal borders, an autonomous military and civil government. Iraq could still exist on paper and a mechanism could be instituted to ensure that oil revenue is equitably divided between the three \u2014 and if it works in Iraq, perhaps this is a future solution for a Balkanized Libya or a disintegrated Syria.Even proponents acknowledge that such separations would not be easy. What to do with the thoroughly \u201cmixed\u201d populations of cities like Baghdad or Aleppo? In Iraq, many tribes are divided into Shia and Sunni subgroups, and in Libya by geographic dispersions going back centuries. Do these people choose to go with tribe or sect or homeland? In fact, parallels in history suggest that such a course would be both wrenching and murderous \u2014 witness the postwar \u201cde-Germanization\u201d policy in Eastern Europe and the 1947 partition of the Indian subcontinent \u2014 but despite the misery and potential body count entailed in getting there, maybe this is the last, best option available to prevent the failed states of the Middle East from devolving into even more brutal slaughter.The problem, though, is that once such subdividing begins, it\u2019s hard to see where it would end. Just beneath the ethnic and religious divisions that the Iraq invasion and the Arab Spring tore open are those of tribe and clan and subclan \u2014 and in this respect, the Kurdistan Regional Government appears not so much a model but a warning.Because of its two feuding tribes, the K.R.G. \u2014 a statelet the size of West Virginia \u2014 now has essentially two of everything: two leaders, two governments, two armies. For the moment this schism has been masked by the threat from ISIS and the desire to present a unified front to the outside world. But it remains an undercurrent to everything. It also goes a long way toward explaining the sad fate of the Yazidis. As Azar pointed out, any fool could see exactly where ISIS was headed in August 2014, but because the Yazidis existed outside the K.R.G. power structure, because they had no traditional alliance with either rival faction, they were left to largely fend for themselves. For all the excuses offered up by K.R.G. politicians and generals, the undeniable fact is that Sinjar simply wouldn\u2019t have happened if its residents had been named Barzani or Talabani.And what happens in the K.R.G. when the current danger subsides? If history is a guide, the Barzani-Talabani schism will worsen and may even lead to another civil war, for part of the hidden history of this place is the series of internecine battles the tribes have waged ever since they first came into contact, a legacy of mutual bloodletting dating back at least half a century and extending to as recently as the mid-1990s. It\u2019s a hidden history that the Mirkhan family knows from personal experience.Over the course of many conversations with the various Mirkhan brothers, I heard a great deal about the exploits and personalities of the two family members who lost their lives as pesh merga and who have now entered the pantheon of Kurdish martyrs: their father, Heso, and their brother, Ali. What I heard little about \u2014 and the brothers\u2019 reticence on this topic became increasingly striking \u2014 were the actual circumstances of their deaths. It was only after repeated prodding that Azar finally divulged what I\u2019d already ascertained independently: rather than by the Kurds\u2019 myriad external enemies, Heso and Ali Mirkhan were actually killed by rival Kurdish pesh merga.\u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace that Kurds should kill each other,\u201d Azar offered when I asked why he\u2019d been so reluctant to share the information. \u201cWith all the other enemies we have, how can we ever turn on each other?\u201dAn excellent question, but it is one likely to be asked again all across a partitioned Middle East, no matter how far down those divisions and subdivisions are made.At about the midpoint on the Sinjar plateau, a bend in the road suddenly revealed an exquisite village on the far side of the river: a series of houses climbing the rocky hillside and, just below them, a number of ancient stone terraces. Some of the terrace walls were more than 20 feet high, the inhabitants determined to carve out any little piece of workable land from the mountain and, built in an age before machines, must have taken years \u2014 decades, perhaps \u2014 to erect. The homes were deserted now, their roofs caved in by Saddam Hussein\u2019s soldiers, but they had left the terraces alone.\u201cIt must have been so beautiful here then,\u201d Azar said, gazing up at the village, \u201ca kind of garden.\u201dBut for Azar, the past was most useful for what it said about the future, and putting Sinjar behind us had set him in a happier, anticipatory mood. As we continued across Sinjar mountain, he drummed his fingers on the steering wheel.\u201cThis is our time now,\u201d he said. \u201cIraq is gone. Syria is gone. Now it is our time.\u201dThat said, I am reminded of something Majd Ibrahim told me: \u201cISIS isn\u2019t just an organization, it\u2019s an idea.\u201d It is also a kind of tribe, of course, and if this incarnation is destroyed, the conditions that created ISIS will remain in the form of a generation of disaffected and futureless young men, like Wakaz Hassan, who find purpose and power and belonging by picking up a gun. In short, nothing gets better anytime soon.On a more philosophical level, this journey has served to remind me again of how terribly delicate is the fabric of civilization, of the vigilance required to protect it and of the slow and painstaking work of mending it once it has been torn. This is hardly an original thought; it is a lesson we were supposed to have learned after Nazi Germany, after Bosnia and Rwanda. Perhaps it is a lesson we need to constantly relearn.Against this, I find solace in the extraordinary power of the individual to bring change, and no person that I met more exemplified this than Khulood al-Zaidi. Through sheer force of will, Khulood \u2014 the youngest daughter of a traditional family in a provincial city in Iraq \u2014 became an unlikely yet remarkable leader and in the process saved what she could of her family. Here, too, though, is a paradox: It is people like Khulood who must see to the mending of these fractured lands. Yet, it is those very people, the best their nations have to offer, who are leaving in search of a better life elsewhere. Today, Austria\u2019s gain is Iraq\u2019s loss.As I write this, the Iraqis are slowly retaking cities from ISIS across the country\u2019s central plains: Ramadi was recaptured in February, Falluja in June. Planning for a joint offensive of Iraqi and Kurdish forces against Mosul is in its advanced stages, and the strike could come as early as October. One who will most certainly play a role in that offensive is Dr. Azar Mirkhan. For Azar, however, the true struggle, of fully separating his Kurdish homeland from the Arab world, will continue in the battle\u2019s aftermath. That aftermath will also mark the end of Wakaz Hassan\u2019s usefulness to his captors; as bluntly explained by the Kurdish security officer, he will then almost surely be handed over to Iraqi authorities for execution.In Libya, Majdi el-Mangoush is continuing his engineering studies, but in contemplating the chaos engulfing his homeland, he has turned to a novel idea: a restoration of the monarchy that Qaddafi overthrew in 1969. \u201cNot that it will solve all our problems,\u201d Majdi told me, \u201cbut at least with the king, we were a nation.\u201d Whatever happens in Libya, he is committed to staying and working for its improvement. \u201cI am ready for a new kind of uncertainty,\u201d he said.In Dresden, Majd Ibrahim has been granted refugee status, which will enable him to remain in Germany for at least the next three years. Now learning German, he hopes to return to college this fall for a master\u2019s degree in hotel management.In Egypt, Laila Soueif\u2019s son, Alaa, is in the second year of his five-year prison sentence. Her daughter, Sanaa, was released in September 2015 under a presidential pardon, after having served 15 months. In May, though, she was found guilty of \u201cinsulting the judiciary\u201d for failing to answer a prosecutor\u2019s request for an interview. Given a six-month sentence, Sanaa is currently being held at a women\u2019s prison in Cairo.In Austria, Khulood and her sister Teamim continue to live with the Edelsbrunner family and were recently awarded scholarships to study intercultural management at a local university beginning in September. Not long ago, their mother, Aziza, who had never left Iraq, and whom Khulood had seen only once since she fled 11 years ago, died in Kut. Khulood\u2019s response to the news was typical of this dauntless young woman. She redoubled her efforts to rescue her remaining family, the father and sister still stranded in Jordan, and bring them to Austria. \u201cTo bring them here, to have a family again,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is my greatest dream.\u201dProduced by Linsey Fields, Danny DeBelius, Meghan Louttit, Jeannie ChoiPhoto editors: Kathy Ryan, Stacey BakerMajdi el-Mangoush, 30.

{"Headline": "I.M.F. Agrees to Lend $12 Billion to Egypt to Fix Ailing Economy", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAIRO \u2014 The International Monetary Fund has tentatively agreed to lend Egypt $12 billion in exchange for significant economic reforms, senior government finance officials said Thursday.The officials said they requested the loan package over a three-year period in part because they have not received financial support recently from Egypt\u2019s oil-rich Persian Gulf allies. They expressed hope that the move would inspire international confidence in President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi\u2019s government and attract desperately needed foreign investment.The loan, which has been given initial approval, will go to the monetary fund\u2019s board of executives for final approval.\u201cIt\u2019s been a year since we have received any money,\u201d the head of the country\u2019s central bank, Tarek Amer, said at a somber news conference here, referring to financial support from Persian Gulf nations like Saudi Arabia, whose revenues have been reduced by the fall in global oil prices.\u201cBut we can\u2019t continue to rely on others,\u201d Mr. Amer added. Then, looking unenthusiastic, he urged Egyptian reporters to whip up public support for the monetary fund\u2019s bailout plan \u2014 and the presumably painful austerity measures that it would bring. \u201cWe must stand together and put up with each other for a while,\u201d he said.The years of political upheaval after President Hosni Mubarak was ousted in 2011 have taken a heavy toll on the country\u2019s economy, especially its revenue from tourism, an important source of hard currency for Egypt, which relies heavily on imports.The announcement of the loan reinforced a general sense of foreboding among Egyptians, especially after Mr. Sisi suggested twice in recent months on state television that they may have to go hungry for their economy to stabilize. The prices of food and electricity have soared.Chris Jarvis, the monetary fund\u2019s mission chief for Egypt, said in a telephone interview that for Egypt to increase its revenue, it would have to enact a value-added tax and continue to cut energy subsidies. Mr. Jarvis said Egyptian officials \u201chave been confident enough to specify\u201d in the agreement that the added government revenue would be used to increase food subsidies and social programs for the poor.Many Egyptians have been skeptical of a loan from the fund because they distrust the government in general and worry that cuts in subsidies could produce runaway inflation that could prompt riots.The agreement with the monetary fund will require the Sisi administration to ease some of the notoriously difficult restrictions on the registration of businesses. It will also require the government to send Parliament more frequent and detailed reports on the country\u2019s economic condition, the deputy finance minister, Ahmed Kouchouk, said.\u201cThings can\u2019t be late anymore,\u201d Mr. Kouchouk said. \u201cWe will provide more information on government spending and on government revenue.\u2019\u2019Apparently in an effort to deflect some of the blame from the Egyptian government, Amr El-Garhy, the finance minister, pointedly noted the role overpopulation has played in the economic crisis. \u201cIn the past 35 years, our population growth has equaled two countries like Algeria and Saudi Arabia combined,\u201d Mr. Garhy said of the country\u2019s 91 million people.Egyptian officials declined to say whether the loan deal would address the country\u2019s rigid currency laws, which have kept the Egyptian pound artificially high and have encouraged a rampant black market.The headline with an article in some editions on Aug. 12 about a loan request from Egypt to the International Monetary Fund overstated the I.M.F.\u2019s action. It tentatively agreed to lend Egypt $12 billion, pending final approval by its board of executives; it did not yet lend the money.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Values Voters Value Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionAs the number of Republican politicians and conservative pundits who renounce Donald J. Trump continues to rise, one important contingent remains steadfast in its support: conservative white evangelicals.Why? Are they dupes or hypocrites?The answer is neither. Conservative evangelicals are fully aware of Mr. Trump\u2019s flaws, but they are supporting him anyway because they believe his election is the only way they can regain control of the Supreme Court. At this moment, control of the court is worth more to them than any other political goal. Nothing that Mr. Trump now says or does is likely to shake their support, because their endorsement was never based on any faith in Mr. Trump\u2019s own character or agenda, but primarily on his promise to nominate conservative Supreme Court justices.The Christian right did not always have such a single-minded focus on the Supreme Court. Thirty-six years ago, when Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson and other leaders rallied to Ronald Reagan\u2019s campaign, changing the court was not even on their minds. Instead, they thought they could pass constitutional amendments to reverse Roe v. Wade and restore classroom prayer in public schools, thus obviating the need for a change on the bench. But when these amendment proposals failed in the Senate, the pro-life movement and the Christian right realized they could probably overturn Roe more quickly through new judicial appointments than through a constitutional amendment.This year, Dr. Dobson is supporting Mr. Trump. The controversy over Obamacare\u2019s contraceptive mandate, along with court decisions on same-sex marriage, have galvanized evangelicals. Most Christian right leaders are more desperate and fearful than they were 20 years ago. They no longer view control of the Supreme Court only as a way to overturn Roe v. Wade; they now see it as essential to preserving their own freedom to act on their religious convictions.But a substantial number of lay evangelical Republicans, along with their counterparts who do not regularly attend church, cared more about immigration, border security and the economy than about abortion and gay rights, and their votes helped make Mr. Trump the presumptive party nominee.But as soon as Mr. Trump released his list of possible Supreme Court picks, many of the evangelical leaders who had considered sitting out the election came over to his side.For most conservative evangelical voters, pragmatism has trumped theological purity, and the comprehensive vision of national moral renewal that once animated the Christian right has given way to a single-minded focus on the Supreme Court. Christian right leaders are certainly correct to believe that their only chance of making the Supreme Court more conservative, if they have any chance at all, rests with Mr. Trump and not with Mrs. Clinton.For the sake of their principles and their faith\u2019s credibility, evangelicals who have reluctantly backed Mr. Trump in order to get a conservative Supreme Court may want to ask themselves how it will look to the rest of the nation if churchgoing, \u201cpro-family\u201d Christians remain some of the last ones propping up Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy after droves of other Republicans have denounced their party\u2019s nominee for his morally offensive statements.Something greater than the Supreme Court may be at stake for American evangelicalism in this election, though most Christian right advocates do not yet realize it. If conservative evangelicals\u2019 support for Mr. Trump requires them to retract their convictions about the values of decency, marital fidelity and Christian virtue in public life, are they at risk of attempting to gain the Supreme Court at the cost of their movement\u2019s soul?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Donald Trump and President Obama Put Republicans in a Bind", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When Donald J. Trump goes low, congressional Republicans go quiet.Their tolerance of Mr. Trump, even at the risk of humiliation, stems from a complex brew of political, policy and personal calculations that differ somewhat between party leaders and officials up for re-election.But on one point, all sides agree: They have never seen a comparable situation, with a presidential nominee in open warfare with party leaders after a nominating convention. And Mr. Trump\u2019s provocations are making the Republicans\u2019 control of the Senate, perhaps even the House, more tenuous.Many Republicans, even those whose contempt for Mr. Trump matches their ill will for President Obama, still view the choice between Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton as a binary one, with long-term implications for every policy area they care about, from judicial appointments to the economy to immigration. They believe that Mr. Trump, guided by a Republican-controlled Congress, will break their way more than Mrs. Clinton ever would.For others, the vacancy on the Supreme Court \u2014 and its potential to reshape the high court\u2019s rulings for years \u2014 overshadow almost everything else, even their nominee\u2019s increasingly erratic statements and grasp of basic facts.\u201cThe Supreme Court is probably the choice that will have the single most long-term effect on the nation,\u201d said Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, where Mr. Trump is struggling to win over an overwhelmingly Republican state.Congressional Republicans who are up for re-election \u2014 especially the handful like Senators John McCain of Arizona and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire who still face primaries \u2014 have made a basic calculation. They have criticized Mr. Trump, but not withdrawn their endorsements. And party leaders have decided the more distance they put between themselves and Mr. Trump, the more likely they are to lose their congressional majorities.Alienating Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters would cost them just enough votes to lose their seats. Their fears at this point appear justified. A poll conducted the last week of July by CBS News found that support for Mr. Trump among Republican voters rose to 81 percent from 79 percent.So the leaders largely responded to Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks with feigned indifference.\u201cRepublican elected officials are in a tough spot,\u201d said Nathan L. Gonzales, the editor of The Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter. \u201cThey are criticized for not listening to the grass roots and criticized for not denouncing the nominee chosen by the grass roots. Some Republicans are reluctant to attack Donald Trump because they\u2019d risk alienating 35 to 40 percent of the party who supported him in the primaries.\u201dBoth Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump have put Republicans into an untenable position: Criticizing their nominee could be seen as taking the advice of a president whom their core voters strongly dislike, potentially alienating the very people they need for re-election \u2014 but sitting idly as Mr. Trump attacks them and makes inflammatory comments might alienate more moderate voters.\u201cIf you are repeatedly having to say, in very strong terms, that what he has said is unacceptable, why are you still endorsing him?\u201d Mr. Obama asked during a news conference on Tuesday.While Donald J. Trump or Hillary Clinton will represent the entire country, the Americans who selected them are a small part of it.Many experts are skeptical that the approach can work. \u201cIn 2008 and 2010, voters did not draw distinctions,\u201d said Fergus Cullen, a former chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party. \u201cIt was not like Passover, where the door was marked, \u2018This one should be spared.\u2019 No, the Angel of Death came in and said no \u2018Let\u2019s kill them all.\u2019 \u201dIt is not just a question of individual desires to win re-election \u2014 although that certainly drives many of the statements about Mr. Trump that come short of rescinding an endorsement. Republicans believe they need to maintain the House and the Senate, through a hoped-for blend of votes from their base and anti-Trump split tickets, to pursue a policy agenda.\u201cThe speaker\u2019s goal, one that you set collectively with members of your conference, is to promote ideas and enact policies that make a difference,\u201d said Kevin Madden, a Republican operative who once worked for former Speaker John A. Boehner. \u201cThe political reality, though, is that this goal can only be reached if members are not put at risk because the top of the national ticket underperforms.\u201dRepublican leaders also know that in an anti-Washington election cycle, the core of the party would most likely be disposed to reject candidates who embody the Washington establishment.Then, there is the vehement opposition to Mrs. Clinton, especially how they view her role in the Benghazi attacks, that has dominated the airwaves for years among Republicans.\u201cI happen to think that lying to the American people is a step way above and beyond some of the disappointing rhetoric of Donald Trump,\u201d said Mr. Chaffetz, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee. He added: \u201cNothing united Republicans more than Hillary Clinton.\u201dSome still may pull away. On Tuesday, Representative Richard Hanna, Republican of New York, said he would endorse Mrs. Clinton for president, calling Mr. Trump \u201cunfit to serve.\u201dBut Mr. Hanna is not representative of the broader Republican conference. \u201cHe came to Congress as an outsider and never fit neatly into the typical boxes,\u201d Mr. Gonzales said. \u201cHe would have had another serious primary challenge this year, if he had decided to seek re-election. But since he\u2019s retiring, he apparently feels even more freedom to say what\u2019s on his mind.\u201dBut if Mr. Trump falls in the polls and Republicans running for re-election start to realize they would do better separating from him and digging deeper for ticket-splitting voters, Mr. Hanna might not be alone.Advertisement"}
