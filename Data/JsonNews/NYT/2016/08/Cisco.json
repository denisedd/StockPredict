{"Headline": "Intel Seems to Have a Stronger Hand Than Cisco Systems", "Date": "2016-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsIntel and Cisco Systems are facing divergent futures. Intel is swallowing its pride and licensing intellectual property from its chip-making rival ARM. Cisco is planning to cut 7 percent of its workers. Intel may have the strong hand.The outlook for last-generation tech companies is often grim as their products become commonplace, rivals find alternatives to problems and margins shrink.That is largely what ails Cisco. Virtual-networking software may be eroding demand for high-end hardware. Chinese rivals are competing fiercely. And revelations about American spying programs could be damaging sales of Cisco switches and routers overseas. Despite new investments, the company\u2019s revenue is stagnant \u2013 often a sign of incipient problems, considering that hardware prices tend to fall steadily.Cutting workers is one way to forestall pain but, as IBM\u2019s travails show, it is a temporary fix. Investing in other areas, as Cisco is in security, for example, has a chance of success, but it is hard to do enough to offset declines in a big core business.Intel may have the better recipe. Its problem is that PC and laptop sales are shrinking, while mobile device sales are on the rise. Nearly all phones and tablets use ARM chips, because they tend to be cheaper and use less power. Many servers run powerful Intel chips behind the scenes, but even that unit of Intel reported only pedestrian 5 percent annual growth in the second quarter.The big advantage for Intel, though, is that making chips requires enormous investment, and prices are still rising steadily. The company spent nearly $20 billion last year on research, development and capital expenditure. Making chips for other companies means it can reap more from these investments by operating its factories at closer to full capacity. Licensing ARM\u2019s technology achieves that and gives Intel a slice of the growth in mobile devices.Intel probably will not maintain the margins from when it had a de facto monopoly on microprocessors for PCs. But the scale needed for chip making has reduced competition. There were about a dozen companies capable of making high-end microprocessors a decade ago. Now there are just four. Intel will probably still be inside for many years to come.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Every Company Is a Tech Company, Does the Label Matter?", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesApple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon have created something of a watershed moment in the stock market.They became the four most valuable companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index at the close of trading on Aug. 1, according to S.&P.\u2019s official tally. That meant that tech companies, by one common definition, occupied the four top spots in the market capitalization rankings, a rare and brief occurrence.\u201cIt may never have happened before at the close of trading,\u201d said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. The full history of daily rankings isn\u2019t readily available, however, so we can\u2019t be certain, and such rankings are evanescent, shifting with every tick of the stock market. In fact, on Friday, Amazon dropped back into sixth place.But no matter: The early August rankings were a reminder of how far tech has come. It is a dominant force in the stock market and the economy, one so all-encompassing that tech may no longer even be a useful concept for understanding today\u2019s stock market.One of them is Exxon Mobil, the energy giant and the most valuable company in the S.&P. as recently as 2012. But Exxon Mobil has been cut down in size by the oil price debacle. The other is Berkshire Hathaway, Warren E. Buffett\u2019s conglomerate, which the S.&P. categorizes as a financial services company \u2014 the only such company left in the Top 10 market cap list. Berkshire announced its own earnings after trading closed on Friday. We\u2019ll soon learn whether the market is pleased enough to vault Berkshire further ahead of Amazon.The three tech companies at the very top in market cap \u2014 Apple, Google and Microsoft \u2014 have held high positions for a long while. (Google, ranked second, trades as Alphabet, the name of its parent company.) Google passed Apple in value briefly this year, but Apple regained the top perch, which it has held since 2012. Microsoft, now No. 3, was the most valuable company during the last tech boom, in the early 2000s.Virtually no one disputes S.&P.\u2019s formal classification of Apple, Google and Microsoft as \u201cinformation technology\u201d companies. The same is true of Facebook, which held seventh place in the latest list of most valuable companies. But while Amazon is often described as a tech company \u2014 and undoubtedly uses and creates innovative technology \u2014 S.&P. has never classified it as one.In fact, Amazon is formally known as a \u201cconsumer discretionary company,\u201d like Walmart, which it has displaced as a member of the Top 10 most valuable companies. Amazon is the only consumer discretionary company left in the Top 10. Is it in some sense a tech company? Certainly, and we\u2019ll get back to that.But the same can be said, to one degree or another, about the three other members of the Top 10 \u2014 old companies that are still prospering in large part because of their mastery of advanced technologies. Johnson & Johnson, for example, which is ranked eighth, is a health care company, yet it is heavily involved in technology of a biological kind. Then there is General Electric, the diversified industrial company (and, until recently, also a financial services company), once described as a bellwether for the entire market. It conducts advanced research and sells tech products.Last on the list is AT&T, a telecommunications company, which, in an early form, helped create computer languages and operating systems on which modern tech companies are built. In 1957, when the S.&P. 500 was born, an ancestral version of AT&T was the most valuable company in the United States by a very wide margin, said Jeremy J. Siegel, a Wharton business school professor, the author of \u201cStocks for the Long Run\u201d and a market historian.\u201cAT&T back then was a highly regulated old phone company,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a giant, later broken up into smaller companies. And it was an outlier, because the other big companies in the S.&P. 500 in that era were mainly materials companies \u2014 like United States Steel, DuPont and Union Carbide \u2014 and an awful lot of oil companies.\u201dIn 1957, the economy ran on oil, and the biggest energy company was Standard Oil of New Jersey \u2014 an ancestor of Exxon Mobil. No pure tech company ranked in the Top 10 back then, not even IBM, which soon became the dominant tech company, a position it held until Microsoft surpassed it in the mid-1990s. That was the decade of the great tech boom, culminating in the bubble that burst in March 2000. Microsoft was No. 1 in market cap at the end of 1999, and four other tech companies \u2014 Cisco Systems, Intel, IBM and America Online \u2014 were also among the Top 10 most valuable companies. The stock market celebrated tech\u2019s ascendance then, as it does now.But this is a different era. When you dig deeper into the S.&P. 500, it\u2019s clear that while the valuations of tech companies swelled to unrealistically high proportions in those bubble years, the valuations of most companies are far more modest now. In March 2000, the height of the bubble, the value of information technology companies swelled to 34.5 percent of the total market cap of the S.&P. 500. At the moment, the comparable figure is only 20.7 percent, data from the Bespoke Investment Group shows. That\u2019s not much more than the 15.7 percent share of financial companies or the 15.2 percent share of the health care sector. By contrast, finance ballooned as high as 22.3 percent at the end of 2006, in what can be seen in hindsight as a financial bubble.On the other hand, materials and energy companies, which together constituted almost half of the total value of the S.&P. 500 in 1957, now account for less than 10 percent of it. That reflects the collapse of energy and commodity prices over the last few years, and it may well be a temporary phenomenon. In the meantime, diversified energy companies like Exxon Mobil are investing heavily in technology, a necessity if they are to flourish.It\u2019s clear even to energy companies, in other words, that tech\u2019s abiding power in the marketplace is not temporary. Technology permeates every sector of the economy, even those not formally classified as high-tech. Whether companies like Amazon and Johnson & Johnson should carry tech labels is beside the point. Tech has already taken over.These days every company is a tech company, but some have better niches, faster growth, more attractive offerings or more favorable share prices than others. These kinds of fundamental distinctions will influence the Top 10 rankings of the future.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

No, we\u2019re not talking about dropping the Wall Street bull\u2019s testicles on to the floor of Congress, though that was how clever editing made it look last week. Rather, Darlene and her core crew \u2014 the nebbish Mobley, who\u2019s ready to run; the more cautious Trenton, who has her Iranian immigrant family to consider; and Darlene\u2019s ex-boyfriend Cisco, their link to the fearsome Dark Army \u2014 record and broadcast a conference call about the F.B.I.\u2019s \u201cOperation Berenstain,\u201d which is warrantlessly monitoring the communications of millions of Americans to hunt for the hack\u2019s perpetrators.\u201cBackdoor access to every smartphone,\u201d a list of cooperating companies that includes \u201cGoogle, AT&T, Uber, Apple, Verizon, Facebook\u201d: This wholesale collusion between the state and corporations to violate privacy is so grimly plausible it barely qualifies as fiction, even before footage of Edward Snowden is repurposed to comment on the scandal.Yet Darlene\u2019s rhetoric in the broadcast, alarmingly violent even by the standards of a group that uses a slasher\u2019s mask as its sigil, is an early indication that the group is feeling desperate. She refers to the government\u2019s \u201ctyrannical rape of our private data,\u201d a disturbing choice of words given fsociety\u2019s collaboration with Julian Assange\u2019s WikiLeaks and its own less than stellar track record with both rape and private data.\u201cWe will destroy you!\u201d she barks at the feds, once again adopting \u201cwar on terror\u201d verbiage \u2014 not a promising route to success. So when the E Corp lawyer Susan Jacobs, a.k.a. Madame Executioner, has her \u201csmart home\u201d unexpectedly commandeered as the group\u2019s headquarters, what befalls her has a nauseating air of inevitability to it.Not that Jacobs comes across as anything but awful during her too-brief stint as the group\u2019s hostage. She goads Trenton about her Muslim faith in an attempt to escape: \u201cIs that what this is about? ISIS or something?\u201d And proceeding to call them a bunch of animals.It does her no good, though, since the moment she slips loose she tries to attack Trenton and winds up banging her head on the wall, knocking herself out. Realizing she\u2019ll need medical care, the frightened foursome frantically search her personal accounts for information with which to blackmail her before they take her to a hospital, and discover that she\u2019s been sleeping with judges in exchange for more favorable verdicts. As their leader, Darlene volunteers to confront Jacobs with their discovery \u2014 but instead tazes her and leaves her to drown in her swimming pool, committing a murder that had been on her mind ever since she was 4 years old and saw Jacobs laughing about the case that killed her and Elliot\u2019s father.From there, things manage to get even uglier, somehow. Darlene and Cisco take Jacobs\u2019s body to the pet crematory they use to dispose of evidence, and are forced to remove her body from the suitcase they\u2019d packed it in and jam it directly into the oven. Mobley and Trenton return home, looking over their shoulders, jumping at every sound \u2014 jittery editing and sudden crash cuts heighten the sense of fear. Sure enough, Mobley is arrested by Dom DiPierro, but she has no idea how high up he is, suspecting him merely of being the D.J. at fsociety\u2019s party the night of the hack. Her superior forces her to let him go in light of the bad press that the bureau is already receiving. He signals to Trenton that they\u2019ve been burned and have to flee, but never shows up at their designated meeting place. Darlene, meanwhile, sleeps at Cisco\u2019s place, and awakens to discover that he\u2019s reporting on her to the Dark Army; the episode ends when she smashes his laptop, then hits him in the head with a baseball bat.Even the relatively tangential Angela has a terrible time of things. She has an ugly confrontation with one of her father\u2019s working-class friends; he hits her with crude sexual insults, she responds with classist cheap shots. She sings a joyless rendition of Tears for Fears\u2019 \u201cEverybody Wants to Rule the World\u201d at karaoke, then ditches her boyfriend for an older man of dubious intent played by Mark Moses (Duck Phillips of \u201cMad Men\u201d). This, perhaps, is for the best, since said boyfriend was an undercover F.B.I. agent, but even so \u2014 just ask Peggy Olson how dating Duck Phillips turned out.But in Elliot\u2019s absence, the episode\u2019s true star is the composer Mac Quayle\u2019s score. The show\u2019s usual electronic hum is complemented, and at times supplanted, by screeching strings and dissonant jolts straight out of a horror film. Which, of course, is what the episode really is: a monster movie, if only in the Nietzschean sense. Darlene has dedicated her life to fighting monsters, and now she\u2019s become one herself. Emerging from an hour of television this expertly discomfiting feels like bursting free of a haunted house.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Once Priced Out, a Cafe Returns in Greenpoint", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut if New York is change, it is also reinvention. A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original location. The new Verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards but has some of the same employees and a similar unpretentious vibe. The coffee is still good, too.Leading the new Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee at the old cafe who is an owner and the general manager at the new place. He started at Verb in 2001 and was there until the end. When a customer offered to bankroll him in a new outpost, he said he was excited to do it.Mr. Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the same. Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels and bought the same model of espresso machine. It even reused the lights from the old Verb. But Mr. Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment. He introduced new ingredients. Bacon-egg-and-cheese sandwiches are on the menu, and toppings like capers and saut\u00e9ed onions are available. There are brown-rice bowls. The cafe no longer serves beer but now makes fresh juices.Nine months in, Mr. Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regulars.\u201cA lot of former customers got priced out of Williamsburg too,\u201d he said.On a recent Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one such customer. Ms. Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and went to Verb frequently. Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would still make the trek. After Verb closed, she said, she gave up drinking coffee for a while.\u201cI realized it was the coffee and the culture at Verb that I liked,\u201d she said.Now she\u2019s back on coffee, although that day, instead of her usual iced coffee, she went with a blended chai drink, another new addition.Tom Rosenthal, another longtime customer, went faithfully to Verb starting in 2003. He\u2019d go before work and order the same thing without fail.\u201cQuarter past seven, every day, like clockwork, I\u2019d come in and they were making my everything bagel with butter,\u201d he said.These days, Mr. Rosenthal still gets his regular order, but sometimes he\u2019ll switch things up with the bacon, egg and cheese on an everything bagel.Mr. Rodriguez said he had no hard feelings about the soap shop taking over the old space. In fact, the Soap Cherie owners offered to make special soap for Verb, using the cafe\u2019s cold-brewed coffee as an ingredient.\u201cI think we still might take them up on it,\u201d Mr. Rodriguez said.And Greenpoint\u2019s traditional Polish residents have embraced the cafe as well. One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Mr. Rodriguez said he planned to find a spot to display it soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome.The new location has other perks. A local juice spot wants to bottle and sell the cold-brewed coffee. There is a chance the cafe will expand into an adjacent building.For many customers, a new Verb to get their old favorites is enough. Joseph Whitt was a regular and said he was heartbroken when they closed. When the new space opened, Mr. Whitt said, walking in and getting a coffee felt like a homecoming.\u201cI\u2019ve needed to smell that,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.E., the 124-Year-Old Software Start-Up", "Date": "2016-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt may not qualify as a lightning-bolt eureka moment, but Jeffrey R. Immelt, chief executive of General Electric, recalls the June day in 2009 that got him thinking. He was speaking with G.E. scientists about new jet engines they were building, laden with sensors to generate a trove of data from every flight \u2014 but to what end?That data could someday be as valuable as the machinery itself, if not more so. But G.E. couldn\u2019t make use of it.But in 2011, G.E. also quietly opened a software center in San Ramon, Calif., 24 miles east of San Francisco, across the bay.Today one of San Ramon\u2019s most important projects is to build a computer operating system, but on an industrial scale \u2014 a Microsoft Windows or Google Android for factories and industrial equipment. The project is central to G.E.\u2019s drive to become what Mr. Immelt says will be a \u201ctop 10 software company\u201d by 2020.Silicon Valley veterans are skeptical.Many industries see digital threats, of course. Yet the scope of the challenge is magnified at G.E., a 124-year-old company and the nation\u2019s largest manufacturer, with more than 300,000 employees worldwide. Employees companywide have been making pilgrimages to San Ramon for technology briefings, but also to soak in the culture. Their marching orders are to try to adapt the digital wizardry and hurry-up habits of Silicon Valley to G.E.\u2019s world of industrial manufacturing.6 PhotosG.E.\u2019s success or failure over the next decade, Mr. Immelt says, depends on this transformation. He calls it \u201cprobably the most important thing I\u2019ve worked on in my career.\u201dApparently, there is no Plan B. \u201cIt\u2019s this or bust,\u201d he said.The march of digital technology \u2014 mainly inexpensive sensors, powerful computing and clever software \u2014 into the industrial world has been underway for years under the guise of \u201cthe internet of things\u201d or \u201cthe industrial internet.\u201d It is the next battlefield as companies fight to develop the dominant software layer that connects the machines.It promises to be a huge market for new products, improved service and efficiency gains in industries like energy, transportation and health care. By 2020, the industrial internet market will reach $225 billion, G.E. executives predicted in a recent meeting with analysts.So far, a major application has been predictive maintenance. Software analyzes the data generated by a machine to identify early warning signals that it needs repair, before it breaks down.The data volumes are exploding as machines new and old spawn sensors. By 2020, G.E. estimates that the data flowing off its machines in use will jump a hundredfold. That should enable far more detailed analysis, giving G.E. a chance to sell its customers not machines but \u201cbusiness outcomes,\u201d like fuel savings. Mr. Immelt sees this as a move up the industrial food chain.Yet all of this exposes G.E. to new competition beyond its traditional rivals like Rockwell Automation, Siemens and United Technologies. Tech giants, including Amazon, Cisco, Google, IBM and Microsoft also have their eye on the industrial internet market, as do a bevy of start-ups.There is precedent for trouble in other industries, of course. Google and Facebook transformed media and advertising, Amazon redefined retailing, and Uber applied an entirely new business model to taxis, which hadn\u2019t changed much in generations.\u201cThe real danger is that the data and analysis becomes worth more than the installed equipment itself,\u201d said Karim R. Lakhani, a professor at the Harvard Business School. \u201cG.E. has no choice but to try to do that itself.\u201dUntil this year, Darren Haas hadn\u2019t thought about G.E., certainly not working there. To him, G.E. meant little more than than kitchen appliances and light bulbs. \u201cI had no idea,\u201d Mr. Haas said.But he was intrigued after he met with Harel Kodesh, an expert in mobile and cloud computing who led teams at Microsoft and VMware, a maker of data-center software. Less than two years ago, Mr. Kodesh joined G.E., and he is now chief technology officer of GE Digital.That someone of Mr. Kodesh\u2019s caliber was a G.E. convert got Mr. Haas\u2019s attention. Then, Mr. Haas started grasping the role that G.E. equipment plays across the economy \u2014 in transportation, in hospitals \u2014 \u201ca whole world,\u201d he said. \u201cI found that really, really compelling.\u201dThe other thing Mr. Haas, 41, found appealing was the big computing challenge that lies ahead for the company. In May, he joined G.E. from Apple, where he was a member of the founding team at Siri, the voice-based digital assistant start-up Apple acquired in 2010. When he left Apple, Mr. Haas was head of cloud engineering, managing the computing engine behind Siri, iTunes and iCloud.At GE Digital, Mr. Haas has a similar title, head of platform cloud engineering, but in a different setting. He describes his job as applying modern software technology \u2014 machine learning, artificial intelligence and cloud computing \u2014 to the industrial arena. \u201cI\u2019ve got my work cut out for me,\u201d he said.Mr. Haas is working on the centerpiece of G.E.\u2019s software strategy, a product called Predix. Its evolution mirrors G.E.\u2019s software ambitions.Predix began as little more than a brand of software used by G.E. to service the gear it sells. One showcase use was in jet engines to do predictive maintenance, saving downtime. Around 2013, William Ruh, a former Cisco Systems executive brought in to put together the San Ramon software center, started expanding Predix to other G.E. industrial businesses.But that soon felt too small. The issue was \u201coutside disrupters,\u201d Mr. Ruh said, citing the online lodging start-up Airbnb as an example of rivals that can appear seemingly out of nowhere and that \u201cbring greater productivity \u2014 but don\u2019t own the assets they sell.\u201d G.E., Mr. Ruh notes, is the ultimate big-asset company.The other threat was rising interest among tech companies to take their internet connectivity expertise and try to apply it to industrial businesses. To get ahead of all this, G.E. reimagined Predix as a cloud-based operating system for industrial applications.Mr. Kodesh leads that effort. He ticks off the looming competitors: Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and others. \u201cThose companies are going to encroach on the territory,\u201d Mr. Kodesh said. \u201cAre we going to capitulate, or build something like Predix?\u201dThe basic idea is that G.E. and outside software developers will write programs to run on Predix. This software might, for instance, monitor the health and fine-tune the operation of equipment like oil-field rigs and wind-farm turbines, improving performance, reducing wear and adapting to changing environmental conditions. It amounts to software delivering the equivalent of personalized medicine for machines.Like any other computer operating system, Predix aims to take the complexity out of writing programs, so more people can create them. And while the instincts of the industrial world are proprietary, G.E. is following an open-source model with Predix, providing a basic design, but one open to outside contributors \u2014 more like Android from Google than Windows from Microsoft.Predix, Mr. Kodesh said, will be improved using the software equivalent of Lego blocks. \u201cSome will be G.E.\u2019s, and some will be made by third-party developers,\u201d he said.G.E. is betting that its deep knowledge of industry will give it an edge in this software arms race. The stakes for this kind of programming can be high.For a regular consumer using the internet, a misfiring algorithm in the software \u2014 \u201ca false positive\u201d \u2014 might mean a person sees an irrelevant online ad, or a bad Amazon book suggestion or Netflix movie recommendation, Mr. Kodesh said. Useless, perhaps, but not necessarily costly. But a false positive that prompts an airline to take a jet engine off the wing, Mr. Kodesh said, is a $100,000 mistake.\u201cWe really do need to have different technology, different algorithms and a different cloud, than in the consumer internet,\u201d he said.G.E. has set an ambitious target for Predix. It hopes to attract $100 million in orders this year, on its way to $4 billion in revenue by 2020. By then, the company forecasts that its total digital business \u2014 more than 90 percent of it software \u2014 may reach as much as $15 billion, up from $6 billion now.For Predix to reach its potential, though, G.E. needs outside programmers to write software for it. The company, with its deep pockets, can start the software-writing parade, but will others follow?This will be a major test. And G.E.\u2019s campaign to build an industrial operating system and create a flourishing ecosystem of software for it is just getting underway in earnest.In late July, G.E. hosted a Predix conference in Las Vegas, which attracted 1,200 software developers. Such developer gatherings are part of the playbook of every major software company but unusual for an industrial corporation.G.E. has some built-in advantages. Its installed base is huge. For example, the company says more than a third of the world\u2019s electricity is generated on G.E. equipment. It can make progress simply by winning over the aircraft makers, oil companies, hospitals and utilities that now depend on G.E. machinery.G.E. is starting to attract a developer following. Tata Consultancy Services, for one, says it now has 500 programmers designing and developing Predix applications for customers in the electric-utility, aviation and health care industries. G.E. also promotes partnerships with Infosys, Wipro and Capgemini to help business write Predix software.When he joined in 2011, Mr. Ruh had no illusions that making software a strength at a heavy-industry company would be easy. At the time, he told Mr. Immelt that would be \u201ca 10-year journey,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of that journey.\u201dPart of that is an effort to change an engineering culture that stretches back generations. \u201cIf G.E. is truly going to be a digital-industrial company, we can\u2019t be separate here,\u201d Mr. Ruh said of his software division. Digital \u201ctools and habits\u201d need to be embedded \u201cin how people do their jobs,\u201d he said.In its factory in Greenville, S.C., G.E. produces both giant power generators and evidence that this metamorphosis might work.The three-story building is crowded with immense cranes and milling, grinding and welding machines, overseen by manufacturing engineers and technicians. The finishing touches are being put on one of G.E.\u2019s new gas turbines.It looks like the business end of a rocket ship lying on its side, a gleaming steel dynamo at rest. It weighs 950,000 pounds. It fires up at nearly 2,900 degrees Fahrenheit, and it can generate enough electricity to supply more than 500,000 households.The gas turbine was brought to market in half the typical five years. That kind of accelerated product development is a performance that G.E. hopes to replicate across its industrial businesses. And it is a story of changes in design and manufacturing practices made possible by digital technology.John Lammas, the 56-year-old vice president for power generation engineering, started his working career 40 years ago, on the shop floor of a Rolls-Royce jet engine factory in Birmingham, England. He has been with G.E. for 31 years, moving up the ranks of the company\u2019s jet engine and power turbine divisions.\u201cI\u2019m an old mechanical guy,\u201d he said. But a couple of years ago, he issued an edict: no more paper drawings.In the past, a model of a new part would be made and then converted to detailed blueprints running to 70 pages or more. These would then be physically sent to G.E. manufacturing engineers and outside suppliers to begin setting up the tooling, casting and cutting for the part.This prototype-and-blueprint routine took up to eight weeks. Now, engineers use 3-D computer models, skip the prototype step and instantly send the models electronically.This goes a step beyond computer-aided design, which is commonplace. In Greenville, the designers are for the first time linked directly with manufacturers and suppliers in real time, in what G.E. calls a \u201cdigital thread.\u201d This means they can collaborate in ways that have changed the work process while making it more likely that problems or defects are spotted sooner.Traditionally, one set of engineers designed a part, and only then passed it on to manufacturing. If a problem arose on the supplier side, the design was kicked back and the process started over. \u201cJobs are combining in this digital world,\u201d Mr. Lammas said.Greenville\u2019s own equipment has been a Predix guinea pig. The machinery and factory were retrofitted with data-generating sensors and the software. Matt Krause, the plant manager, said that last winter, when a snowstorm shut the factory for a day, the sensor network detected that the plant had consumed 1,000 pounds of argon, an inert gas used in coatings for parts. The leak was fixed, saving $350,000 a year.\u201cWe can see things we never did before,\u201d Mr. Krause said. Over all, 60 of 200 steps in design and production have been automated or eliminated, reducing work time by 530,000 hours over three years, G.E. estimates.Not all the start-up ideas that G.E. is trying to breed translate comfortably to heavy industry. Lean proponents urge companies to come up with \u201cminimum viable products,\u201d particularly test versions of software programs. But no one wants a minimum viable jet engine or power generator.Yet in Greenville, engineers in the design stages are encouraged to move faster in smaller steps, conduct more experiments, and be willing to fail and try again. It amounts to a sea change in the engineering culture of heavy industry.\u201cAs an engineer, not getting it right the first time, I find painful,\u201d said Bill Byrne, an engineering manager. \u201cIt\u2019s uncomfortable. But it\u2019s been incredibly liberating.\u201dThe old ways, said Mr. Lammas, the engineering chief, had merit. Each step and rule was logical on its own. But the emphasis on flawless execution and perfection fostered a fear of failure. \u201cOvercoming that culture was probably the biggest challenge,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Intel Seems to Have a Stronger Hand Than Cisco Systems", "Date": "2016-08-17", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsIntel and Cisco Systems are facing divergent futures. Intel is swallowing its pride and licensing intellectual property from its chip-making rival ARM. Cisco is planning to cut 7 percent of its workers. Intel may have the strong hand.The outlook for last-generation tech companies is often grim as their products become commonplace, rivals find alternatives to problems and margins shrink.That is largely what ails Cisco. Virtual-networking software may be eroding demand for high-end hardware. Chinese rivals are competing fiercely. And revelations about American spying programs could be damaging sales of Cisco switches and routers overseas. Despite new investments, the company\u2019s revenue is stagnant \u2013 often a sign of incipient problems, considering that hardware prices tend to fall steadily.Cutting workers is one way to forestall pain but, as IBM\u2019s travails show, it is a temporary fix. Investing in other areas, as Cisco is in security, for example, has a chance of success, but it is hard to do enough to offset declines in a big core business.Intel may have the better recipe. Its problem is that PC and laptop sales are shrinking, while mobile device sales are on the rise. Nearly all phones and tablets use ARM chips, because they tend to be cheaper and use less power. Many servers run powerful Intel chips behind the scenes, but even that unit of Intel reported only pedestrian 5 percent annual growth in the second quarter.The big advantage for Intel, though, is that making chips requires enormous investment, and prices are still rising steadily. The company spent nearly $20 billion last year on research, development and capital expenditure. Making chips for other companies means it can reap more from these investments by operating its factories at closer to full capacity. Licensing ARM\u2019s technology achieves that and gives Intel a slice of the growth in mobile devices.Intel probably will not maintain the margins from when it had a de facto monopoly on microprocessors for PCs. But the scale needed for chip making has reduced competition. There were about a dozen companies capable of making high-end microprocessors a decade ago. Now there are just four. Intel will probably still be inside for many years to come.Advertisement"}

No, we\u2019re not talking about dropping the Wall Street bull\u2019s testicles on to the floor of Congress, though that was how clever editing made it look last week. Rather, Darlene and her core crew \u2014 the nebbish Mobley, who\u2019s ready to run; the more cautious Trenton, who has her Iranian immigrant family to consider; and Darlene\u2019s ex-boyfriend Cisco, their link to the fearsome Dark Army \u2014 record and broadcast a conference call about the F.B.I.\u2019s \u201cOperation Berenstain,\u201d which is warrantlessly monitoring the communications of millions of Americans to hunt for the hack\u2019s perpetrators.\u201cBackdoor access to every smartphone,\u201d a list of cooperating companies that includes \u201cGoogle, AT&T, Uber, Apple, Verizon, Facebook\u201d: This wholesale collusion between the state and corporations to violate privacy is so grimly plausible it barely qualifies as fiction, even before footage of Edward Snowden is repurposed to comment on the scandal.Yet Darlene\u2019s rhetoric in the broadcast, alarmingly violent even by the standards of a group that uses a slasher\u2019s mask as its sigil, is an early indication that the group is feeling desperate. She refers to the government\u2019s \u201ctyrannical rape of our private data,\u201d a disturbing choice of words given fsociety\u2019s collaboration with Julian Assange\u2019s WikiLeaks and its own less than stellar track record with both rape and private data.\u201cWe will destroy you!\u201d she barks at the feds, once again adopting \u201cwar on terror\u201d verbiage \u2014 not a promising route to success. So when the E Corp lawyer Susan Jacobs, a.k.a. Madame Executioner, has her \u201csmart home\u201d unexpectedly commandeered as the group\u2019s headquarters, what befalls her has a nauseating air of inevitability to it.Not that Jacobs comes across as anything but awful during her too-brief stint as the group\u2019s hostage. She goads Trenton about her Muslim faith in an attempt to escape: \u201cIs that what this is about? ISIS or something?\u201d And proceeding to call them a bunch of animals.It does her no good, though, since the moment she slips loose she tries to attack Trenton and winds up banging her head on the wall, knocking herself out. Realizing she\u2019ll need medical care, the frightened foursome frantically search her personal accounts for information with which to blackmail her before they take her to a hospital, and discover that she\u2019s been sleeping with judges in exchange for more favorable verdicts. As their leader, Darlene volunteers to confront Jacobs with their discovery \u2014 but instead tazes her and leaves her to drown in her swimming pool, committing a murder that had been on her mind ever since she was 4 years old and saw Jacobs laughing about the case that killed her and Elliot\u2019s father.From there, things manage to get even uglier, somehow. Darlene and Cisco take Jacobs\u2019s body to the pet crematory they use to dispose of evidence, and are forced to remove her body from the suitcase they\u2019d packed it in and jam it directly into the oven. Mobley and Trenton return home, looking over their shoulders, jumping at every sound \u2014 jittery editing and sudden crash cuts heighten the sense of fear. Sure enough, Mobley is arrested by Dom DiPierro, but she has no idea how high up he is, suspecting him merely of being the D.J. at fsociety\u2019s party the night of the hack. Her superior forces her to let him go in light of the bad press that the bureau is already receiving. He signals to Trenton that they\u2019ve been burned and have to flee, but never shows up at their designated meeting place. Darlene, meanwhile, sleeps at Cisco\u2019s place, and awakens to discover that he\u2019s reporting on her to the Dark Army; the episode ends when she smashes his laptop, then hits him in the head with a baseball bat.Even the relatively tangential Angela has a terrible time of things. She has an ugly confrontation with one of her father\u2019s working-class friends; he hits her with crude sexual insults, she responds with classist cheap shots. She sings a joyless rendition of Tears for Fears\u2019 \u201cEverybody Wants to Rule the World\u201d at karaoke, then ditches her boyfriend for an older man of dubious intent played by Mark Moses (Duck Phillips of \u201cMad Men\u201d). This, perhaps, is for the best, since said boyfriend was an undercover F.B.I. agent, but even so \u2014 just ask Peggy Olson how dating Duck Phillips turned out.But in Elliot\u2019s absence, the episode\u2019s true star is the composer Mac Quayle\u2019s score. The show\u2019s usual electronic hum is complemented, and at times supplanted, by screeching strings and dissonant jolts straight out of a horror film. Which, of course, is what the episode really is: a monster movie, if only in the Nietzschean sense. Darlene has dedicated her life to fighting monsters, and now she\u2019s become one herself. Emerging from an hour of television this expertly discomfiting feels like bursting free of a haunted house.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple, Congress and the Missing Taxes", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialApple and the United States are crying foul over the ruling in Europe that Apple received illegal tax breaks from Ireland and must hand over 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion), a record tax penalty in Europe.But Apple and the United States have only themselves to blame for the situation.Initially, deferral was a convenience for multinationals, as they sought investment opportunities abroad. Today, it is the taproot of global tax avoidance. Financial engineering has let American companies shift profits into foreign accounts, while they lobby Congress for tax-rate cuts in exchange for repatriating the money. Currently, there is some $2 trillion in corporate profits in offshore tax-deferred accounts; besides Apple, Microsoft, Google, Cisco and Oracle also have large stashes. Apple is one of nearly two dozen major corporations pushing Congress for a \u201ctax holiday,\u201d which would let companies bring back foreign-held money over the course of a year at a discounted tax rate, rather than the current rate, 35 percent.Before the European ruling on Tuesday, the debate over a tax holiday had pitted Republicans, who have generally favored the idea, against Democrats, who have viewed it as an unjustified reward for tax avoidance. The Democrats have history on their side. A tax holiday in 2005 lowered the corporate rate to 5.25 percent, enticing corporations to repatriate some $300 billion. It was billed as a way to create jobs and increase investment, but the money was used mostly for dividend payments, share buybacks (which tend to raise executive pay) and severance for laid-off employees. Worse, the tax holiday inspired multinationals to stash as much money abroad as they possibly could in anticipation of another holiday.The European ruling, however, could sharply alter the terms of the congressional debate. Republicans and Democrats alike have always assumed that foreign-held profits would one day be repatriated. The big question was the rate at which they would ultimately be taxed. Similarly, the Treasury assumes that deferred foreign profits will one day be taxed when it projects future revenues \u2014 an important measure of the nation\u2019s fiscal health.But the money won\u2019t be repatriated and taxed under American law if Europeans, in the course of enforcing their own laws against tax havens, get their hands on it first. And that, in a nutshell, is why members of Congress and Treasury officials are so upset about the Apple ruling. They understand, correctly, that tax-law enforcement in Europe could reduce the sums they expect to collect taxes on someday. What they don\u2019t understand, or aren\u2019t saying, is that they brought the problem on themselves.The way forward is not to declare a tax war with Europe. It is for Congress to agree on a way to tax foreign-held corporate profits. President Obama put forth a reasonable approach in 2015, when he proposed a mandatory 14 percent tax on multinationals\u2019 current offshore profits \u2014 whether they are repatriated or not \u2014 and, thereafter, a new minimum tax rate of 19 percent on profits moved offshore. An even better approach would be to simply end indefinite corporate tax deferral, imposing American taxes on profits when they are made.Republicans rejected Mr. Obama\u2019s proposal in 2015, and there is no chance that lawmakers will engage in such a debate so close to the election. But the next president and Congress will need to act to ensure that at long last, American corporations pay their fair share in taxes.Advertisement"}

A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original location. The new Verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards but has some of the same employees and a similar unpretentious vibe. The coffee is still good, too.Leading the new Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee at the old cafe who is an owner and the general manager at the new place. He started at Verb in 2001 and was there until the end. When a customer offered to bankroll him in a new outpost, he said he was excited to do it.Mr. Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the same. Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels and bought the same model of espresso machine. It even reused the lights from the old Verb. But Mr. Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment. He introduced new ingredients. Bacon-egg-and-cheese sandwiches are on the menu, and toppings like capers and saut\u00e9ed onions are available. There are brown-rice bowls. The cafe no longer serves beer but now makes fresh juices.Nine months in, Mr. Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regulars.\u201cA lot of former customers got priced out of Williamsburg too,\u201d he said.On a recent Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one such customer. Ms. Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and went to Verb frequently. Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would still make the trek. After Verb closed, she said, she gave up drinking coffee for a while.\u201cI realized it was the coffee and the culture at Verb that I liked,\u201d she said.Now she\u2019s back on coffee, although that day, instead of her usual iced coffee, she went with a blended chai drink, another new addition.Tom Rosenthal, another longtime customer, went faithfully to Verb starting in 2003. He\u2019d go before work and order the same thing without fail.\u201cQuarter past seven, every day, like clockwork, I\u2019d come in and they were making my everything bagel with butter,\u201d he said.These days, Mr. Rosenthal still gets his regular order, but sometimes he\u2019ll switch things up with the bacon, egg and cheese on an everything bagel.Mr. Rodriguez said he had no hard feelings about the soap shop taking over the old space. In fact, the Soap Cherie owners offered to make special soap for Verb, using the cafe\u2019s cold-brewed coffee as an ingredient.\u201cI think we still might take them up on it,\u201d Mr. Rodriguez said.And Greenpoint\u2019s traditional Polish residents have embraced the cafe as well. One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Mr. Rodriguez said he planned to find a spot to display it soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome.The new location has other perks. A local juice spot wants to bottle and sell the cold-brewed coffee. There is a chance the cafe will expand into an adjacent building.For many customers, a new Verb to get their old favorites is enough. Joseph Whitt was a regular and said he was heartbroken when they closed. When the new space opened, Mr. Whitt said, walking in and getting a coffee felt like a homecoming.\u201cI\u2019ve needed to smell that,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Age of Post-Truth Politics", "Date": "2016-08-24", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorFacts hold a sacred place in Western liberal democracies. Whenever democracy seems to be going awry, when voters are manipulated or politicians are ducking questions, we turn to facts for salvation.For the Brexit referendum, Leave argued that European Union membership costs Britain 350 million pounds a week, but failed to account for the money received in return.The sense is widespread: We have entered an age of post-truth politics.As politics becomes more adversarial and dominated by television performances, the status of facts in public debate rises too high. We place expectations on statistics and expert testimony that strains them to breaking point. Rather than sit coolly outside the fray of political argument, facts are now one of the main rhetorical weapons within it.How can we still be speaking of \u201cfacts\u201d when they no longer provide us with a reality that we all agree on? The problem is that the experts and agencies involved in producing facts have multiplied, and many are now for hire. If you really want to find an expert willing to endorse a fact, and have sufficient money or political clout behind you, you probably can.The combination of populist movements with social media is often held responsible for post-truth politics. Individuals have growing opportunities to shape their media consumption around their own opinions and prejudices, and populist leaders are ready to encourage them.But to focus on recent, more egregious abuses of facts is to overlook the ways in which the authority of facts has been in decline for quite some time. Newspapers might provide resistance to the excesses of populist demagogy, but not to the broader crisis of facts.The problem is the oversupply of facts in the 21st century: There are too many sources, too many methods, with varying levels of credibility, depending on who funded a given study and how the eye-catching number was selected.In the centuries that followed, accounting was joined by statistics, economics, surveys and a range of other numerical methods. But even as these methods expanded, they tended to be the preserve of small, tight-knit institutions, academic societies and professional associations who could uphold standards. National statistical associations, for example, soon provided the know-how for official statistics offices, affiliated with and funded by governments.In the 20th century, an industry for facts emerged. Market-research companies began to conduct surveys in the 1920s and extended into opinion polling in the 1930s. Think tanks like the American Enterprise Institute were established during and after World War II to apply statistics and economics to the design of new government policies, typically in the service of one political agenda or another. The idea of \u201cevidence-based policy,\u201d popular among liberal politicians in the late 1990s and early 2000s, saw economics being heavily leaned on to justify government programs, in an allegedly post-ideological age.Of course the term \u201cfact\u201d isn\u2019t reserved exclusively for numbers. But it does imply a type of knowledge that can be reliably parceled out in public, without constant need for verification or interpretation.Yet there is one much more radical contributor to our post-truth politics that could ultimately be as transformative of our society as accounting proved to be 500 years ago.We are in the middle of a transition from a society of facts to a society of data. During this interim, confusion abounds surrounding the exact status of knowledge and numbers in public life, exacerbating the sense that truth itself is being abandoned.The place to start in understanding this transition is with the spread of \u201csmart\u201d technologies into everyday life, sometimes called the \u201cinternet of things.\u201d Thanks to the presence of smartphones and smartcards in our pockets, the dramatic uptake of social media, the rise of e-commerce as a means of purchasing goods and services, and the spread of sensory devices across public spaces, we leave a vast quantity of data in our wake as we go about our daily activities.Like statistics or other traditional facts, this data is quantitative in nature. What\u2019s new is both its unprecedented volume (the \u201cbig\u201d in big data) and also the fact that it is being constantly collected by default, rather than by deliberate expert design. Numbers are being generated much faster than we have any specific use for. But they can nevertheless be mined to get a sense of how people are behaving and what they are thinking.The promise of facts is to settle arguments between warring perspectives and simplify the issues at stake. For instance, politicians might disagree over the right economic policy, but if they can agree that \u201cthe economy has grown by 2 percent\u201d and \u201cunemployment is 5 percent,\u201d then there is at least a shared stable reality that they can argue over.The promise of data, by contrast, is to sense shifts in public sentiment. By analyzing Twitter using algorithms, for example, it is possible to get virtually real-time updates on how a given politician is perceived. This is what\u2019s known as \u201csentiment analysis.\u201dThere are precedents for this, such as the \u201cworm\u201d that monitors live audience reaction during a televised presidential debate, rising and falling in response to each moment of a candidate\u2019s rhetoric. Financial markets represent the sentiments of traders as they fluctuate throughout the day. Stock markets never produce a fact as to what Cisco is worth in the way that an accountant can; they provide a window into how thousands of people around the world are feeling about Cisco, from one minute to the next.Journalists and politicians can no more ignore a constant audit of collective mood than C.E.O.s can ignore the fluctuations in their companies\u2019 share prices. If the British government had spent more time trying to track public sentiment toward the European Union and less time repeating the facts of how the British economy benefited from membership in the union, it might have fought the Brexit referendum campaign differently and more successfully.Dominic Cummings, one of the leading pro-Brexit campaigners, mocked what he called outdated polling techniques. He also asked one pollster to add a question on \u201centhusiasm,\u201d and, employing scientists to mine very large, up-to-the-minute data sets, to gauge voter mood and to react accordingly with ads and voter-turnout volunteers.It is possible to live in a world of data but no facts. Think of how we employ weather forecasts: We understand that it is not a fact that it will be 75 degrees on Thursday, and that figure will fluctuate all the time. Weather forecasting works in a similar way to sentiment analysis, bringing data from a wide range of sensory devices, and converting this into a constantly evolving narrative about the near future.However, this produces some chilling possibilities for politics. Once numbers are viewed more as indicators of current sentiment, rather than as statements about reality, how are we to achieve any consensus on the nature of social, economic and environmental problems, never mind agree on the solutions?Conspiracy theories prosper under such conditions. And while we will have far greater means of knowing how many people believe those theories, we will have far fewer means of persuading them to abandon them.William Davies is an associate professor in political economy at Goldsmiths, University of London, and the author of \u201cThe Happiness Industry: How the Government and Big Business Sold Us Well-Being.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "G.E., the 124-Year-Old Software Start-Up", "Date": "2016-08-27", "News": "Supported byIt may not qualify as a lightning-bolt eureka moment, but Jeffrey R. Immelt, chief executive of General Electric, recalls the June day in 2009 that got him thinking. He was speaking with G.E. scientists about new jet engines they were building, laden with sensors to generate a trove of data from every flight \u2014 but to what end?That data could someday be as valuable as the machinery itself, if not more so. But G.E. couldn\u2019t make use of it.But in 2011, G.E. also quietly opened a software center in San Ramon, Calif., 24 miles east of San Francisco, across the bay.Today one of San Ramon\u2019s most important projects is to build a computer operating system, but on an industrial scale \u2014 a Microsoft Windows or Google Android for factories and industrial equipment. The project is central to G.E.\u2019s drive to become what Mr. Immelt says will be a \u201ctop 10 software company\u201d by 2020.Silicon Valley veterans are skeptical.Many industries see digital threats, of course. Yet the scope of the challenge is magnified at G.E., a 124-year-old company and the nation\u2019s largest manufacturer, with more than 300,000 employees worldwide. Employees companywide have been making pilgrimages to San Ramon for technology briefings, but also to soak in the culture. Their marching orders are to try to adapt the digital wizardry and hurry-up habits of Silicon Valley to G.E.\u2019s world of industrial manufacturing.6 PhotosG.E.\u2019s success or failure over the next decade, Mr. Immelt says, depends on this transformation. He calls it \u201cprobably the most important thing I\u2019ve worked on in my career.\u201dApparently, there is no Plan B. \u201cIt\u2019s this or bust,\u201d he said.The march of digital technology \u2014 mainly inexpensive sensors, powerful computing and clever software \u2014 into the industrial world has been underway for years under the guise of \u201cthe internet of things\u201d or \u201cthe industrial internet.\u201d It is the next battlefield as companies fight to develop the dominant software layer that connects the machines.It promises to be a huge market for new products, improved service and efficiency gains in industries like energy, transportation and health care. By 2020, the industrial internet market will reach $225 billion, G.E. executives predicted in a recent meeting with analysts.So far, a major application has been predictive maintenance. Software analyzes the data generated by a machine to identify early warning signals that it needs repair, before it breaks down.The data volumes are exploding as machines new and old spawn sensors. By 2020, G.E. estimates that the data flowing off its machines in use will jump a hundredfold. That should enable far more detailed analysis, giving G.E. a chance to sell its customers not machines but \u201cbusiness outcomes,\u201d like fuel savings. Mr. Immelt sees this as a move up the industrial food chain.Yet all of this exposes G.E. to new competition beyond its traditional rivals like Rockwell Automation, Siemens and United Technologies. Tech giants, including Amazon, Cisco, Google, IBM and Microsoft also have their eye on the industrial internet market, as do a bevy of start-ups.There is precedent for trouble in other industries, of course. Google and Facebook transformed media and advertising, Amazon redefined retailing, and Uber applied an entirely new business model to taxis, which hadn\u2019t changed much in generations.\u201cThe real danger is that the data and analysis becomes worth more than the installed equipment itself,\u201d said Karim R. Lakhani, a professor at the Harvard Business School. \u201cG.E. has no choice but to try to do that itself.\u201dUntil this year, Darren Haas hadn\u2019t thought about G.E., certainly not working there. To him, G.E. meant little more than than kitchen appliances and light bulbs. \u201cI had no idea,\u201d Mr. Haas said.But he was intrigued after he met with Harel Kodesh, an expert in mobile and cloud computing who led teams at Microsoft and VMware, a maker of data-center software. Less than two years ago, Mr. Kodesh joined G.E., and he is now chief technology officer of GE Digital.That someone of Mr. Kodesh\u2019s caliber was a G.E. convert got Mr. Haas\u2019s attention. Then, Mr. Haas started grasping the role that G.E. equipment plays across the economy \u2014 in transportation, in hospitals \u2014 \u201ca whole world,\u201d he said. \u201cI found that really, really compelling.\u201dThe other thing Mr. Haas, 41, found appealing was the big computing challenge that lies ahead for the company. In May, he joined G.E. from Apple, where he was a member of the founding team at Siri, the voice-based digital assistant start-up Apple acquired in 2010. When he left Apple, Mr. Haas was head of cloud engineering, managing the computing engine behind Siri, iTunes and iCloud.At GE Digital, Mr. Haas has a similar title, head of platform cloud engineering, but in a different setting. He describes his job as applying modern software technology \u2014 machine learning, artificial intelligence and cloud computing \u2014 to the industrial arena. \u201cI\u2019ve got my work cut out for me,\u201d he said.Mr. Haas is working on the centerpiece of G.E.\u2019s software strategy, a product called Predix. Its evolution mirrors G.E.\u2019s software ambitions.Predix began as little more than a brand of software used by G.E. to service the gear it sells. One showcase use was in jet engines to do predictive maintenance, saving downtime. Around 2013, William Ruh, a former Cisco Systems executive brought in to put together the San Ramon software center, started expanding Predix to other G.E. industrial businesses.But that soon felt too small. The issue was \u201coutside disrupters,\u201d Mr. Ruh said, citing the online lodging start-up Airbnb as an example of rivals that can appear seemingly out of nowhere and that \u201cbring greater productivity \u2014 but don\u2019t own the assets they sell.\u201d G.E., Mr. Ruh notes, is the ultimate big-asset company.The other threat was rising interest among tech companies to take their internet connectivity expertise and try to apply it to industrial businesses. To get ahead of all this, G.E. reimagined Predix as a cloud-based operating system for industrial applications.Mr. Kodesh leads that effort. He ticks off the looming competitors: Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and others. \u201cThose companies are going to encroach on the territory,\u201d Mr. Kodesh said. \u201cAre we going to capitulate, or build something like Predix?\u201dThe basic idea is that G.E. and outside software developers will write programs to run on Predix. This software might, for instance, monitor the health and fine-tune the operation of equipment like oil-field rigs and wind-farm turbines, improving performance, reducing wear and adapting to changing environmental conditions. It amounts to software delivering the equivalent of personalized medicine for machines.Like any other computer operating system, Predix aims to take the complexity out of writing programs, so more people can create them. And while the instincts of the industrial world are proprietary, G.E. is following an open-source model with Predix, providing a basic design, but one open to outside contributors \u2014 more like Android from Google than Windows from Microsoft.Predix, Mr. Kodesh said, will be improved using the software equivalent of Lego blocks. \u201cSome will be G.E.\u2019s, and some will be made by third-party developers,\u201d he said.G.E. is betting that its deep knowledge of industry will give it an edge in this software arms race. The stakes for this kind of programming can be high.For a regular consumer using the internet, a misfiring algorithm in the software \u2014 \u201ca false positive\u201d \u2014 might mean a person sees an irrelevant online ad, or a bad Amazon book suggestion or Netflix movie recommendation, Mr. Kodesh said. Useless, perhaps, but not necessarily costly. But a false positive that prompts an airline to take a jet engine off the wing, Mr. Kodesh said, is a $100,000 mistake.\u201cWe really do need to have different technology, different algorithms and a different cloud, than in the consumer internet,\u201d he said.G.E. has set an ambitious target for Predix. It hopes to attract $100 million in orders this year, on its way to $4 billion in revenue by 2020. By then, the company forecasts that its total digital business \u2014 more than 90 percent of it software \u2014 may reach as much as $15 billion, up from $6 billion now.For Predix to reach its potential, though, G.E. needs outside programmers to write software for it. The company, with its deep pockets, can start the software-writing parade, but will others follow?This will be a major test. And G.E.\u2019s campaign to build an industrial operating system and create a flourishing ecosystem of software for it is just getting underway in earnest.In late July, G.E. hosted a Predix conference in Las Vegas, which attracted 1,200 software developers. Such developer gatherings are part of the playbook of every major software company but unusual for an industrial corporation.G.E. has some built-in advantages. Its installed base is huge. For example, the company says more than a third of the world\u2019s electricity is generated on G.E. equipment. It can make progress simply by winning over the aircraft makers, oil companies, hospitals and utilities that now depend on G.E. machinery.G.E. is starting to attract a developer following. Tata Consultancy Services, for one, says it now has 500 programmers designing and developing Predix applications for customers in the electric-utility, aviation and health care industries. G.E. also promotes partnerships with Infosys, Wipro and Capgemini to help business write Predix software.When he joined in 2011, Mr. Ruh had no illusions that making software a strength at a heavy-industry company would be easy. At the time, he told Mr. Immelt that would be \u201ca 10-year journey,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of that journey.\u201dPart of that is an effort to change an engineering culture that stretches back generations. \u201cIf G.E. is truly going to be a digital-industrial company, we can\u2019t be separate here,\u201d Mr. Ruh said of his software division. Digital \u201ctools and habits\u201d need to be embedded \u201cin how people do their jobs,\u201d he said.In its factory in Greenville, S.C., G.E. produces both giant power generators and evidence that this metamorphosis might work.The three-story building is crowded with immense cranes and milling, grinding and welding machines, overseen by manufacturing engineers and technicians. The finishing touches are being put on one of G.E.\u2019s new gas turbines.It looks like the business end of a rocket ship lying on its side, a gleaming steel dynamo at rest. It weighs 950,000 pounds. It fires up at nearly 2,900 degrees Fahrenheit, and it can generate enough electricity to supply more than 500,000 households.The gas turbine was brought to market in half the typical five years. That kind of accelerated product development is a performance that G.E. hopes to replicate across its industrial businesses. And it is a story of changes in design and manufacturing practices made possible by digital technology.John Lammas, the 56-year-old vice president for power generation engineering, started his working career 40 years ago, on the shop floor of a Rolls-Royce jet engine factory in Birmingham, England. He has been with G.E. for 31 years, moving up the ranks of the company\u2019s jet engine and power turbine divisions.\u201cI\u2019m an old mechanical guy,\u201d he said. But a couple of years ago, he issued an edict: no more paper drawings.In the past, a model of a new part would be made and then converted to detailed blueprints running to 70 pages or more. These would then be physically sent to G.E. manufacturing engineers and outside suppliers to begin setting up the tooling, casting and cutting for the part.This prototype-and-blueprint routine took up to eight weeks. Now, engineers use 3-D computer models, skip the prototype step and instantly send the models electronically.This goes a step beyond computer-aided design, which is commonplace. In Greenville, the designers are for the first time linked directly with manufacturers and suppliers in real time, in what G.E. calls a \u201cdigital thread.\u201d This means they can collaborate in ways that have changed the work process while making it more likely that problems or defects are spotted sooner.Traditionally, one set of engineers designed a part, and only then passed it on to manufacturing. If a problem arose on the supplier side, the design was kicked back and the process started over. \u201cJobs are combining in this digital world,\u201d Mr. Lammas said.Greenville\u2019s own equipment has been a Predix guinea pig. The machinery and factory were retrofitted with data-generating sensors and the software. Matt Krause, the plant manager, said that last winter, when a snowstorm shut the factory for a day, the sensor network detected that the plant had consumed 1,000 pounds of argon, an inert gas used in coatings for parts. The leak was fixed, saving $350,000 a year.\u201cWe can see things we never did before,\u201d Mr. Krause said. Over all, 60 of 200 steps in design and production have been automated or eliminated, reducing work time by 530,000 hours over three years, G.E. estimates.Not all the start-up ideas that G.E. is trying to breed translate comfortably to heavy industry. Lean proponents urge companies to come up with \u201cminimum viable products,\u201d particularly test versions of software programs. But no one wants a minimum viable jet engine or power generator.Yet in Greenville, engineers in the design stages are encouraged to move faster in smaller steps, conduct more experiments, and be willing to fail and try again. It amounts to a sea change in the engineering culture of heavy industry.\u201cAs an engineer, not getting it right the first time, I find painful,\u201d said Bill Byrne, an engineering manager. \u201cIt\u2019s uncomfortable. But it\u2019s been incredibly liberating.\u201dThe old ways, said Mr. Lammas, the engineering chief, had merit. Each step and rule was logical on its own. But the emphasis on flawless execution and perfection fostered a fear of failure. \u201cOvercoming that culture was probably the biggest challenge,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Age of Post-Truth Politics", "Date": "2016-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorFacts hold a sacred place in Western liberal democracies. Whenever democracy seems to be going awry, when voters are manipulated or politicians are ducking questions, we turn to facts for salvation.For the Brexit referendum, Leave argued that European Union membership costs Britain 350 million pounds a week, but failed to account for the money received in return.The sense is widespread: We have entered an age of post-truth politics.As politics becomes more adversarial and dominated by television performances, the status of facts in public debate rises too high. We place expectations on statistics and expert testimony that strains them to breaking point. Rather than sit coolly outside the fray of political argument, facts are now one of the main rhetorical weapons within it.How can we still be speaking of \u201cfacts\u201d when they no longer provide us with a reality that we all agree on? The problem is that the experts and agencies involved in producing facts have multiplied, and many are now for hire. If you really want to find an expert willing to endorse a fact, and have sufficient money or political clout behind you, you probably can.The combination of populist movements with social media is often held responsible for post-truth politics. Individuals have growing opportunities to shape their media consumption around their own opinions and prejudices, and populist leaders are ready to encourage them.But to focus on recent, more egregious abuses of facts is to overlook the ways in which the authority of facts has been in decline for quite some time. Newspapers might provide resistance to the excesses of populist demagogy, but not to the broader crisis of facts.The problem is the oversupply of facts in the 21st century: There are too many sources, too many methods, with varying levels of credibility, depending on who funded a given study and how the eye-catching number was selected.In the centuries that followed, accounting was joined by statistics, economics, surveys and a range of other numerical methods. But even as these methods expanded, they tended to be the preserve of small, tight-knit institutions, academic societies and professional associations who could uphold standards. National statistical associations, for example, soon provided the know-how for official statistics offices, affiliated with and funded by governments.In the 20th century, an industry for facts emerged. Market-research companies began to conduct surveys in the 1920s and extended into opinion polling in the 1930s. Think tanks like the American Enterprise Institute were established during and after World War II to apply statistics and economics to the design of new government policies, typically in the service of one political agenda or another. The idea of \u201cevidence-based policy,\u201d popular among liberal politicians in the late 1990s and early 2000s, saw economics being heavily leaned on to justify government programs, in an allegedly post-ideological age.Of course the term \u201cfact\u201d isn\u2019t reserved exclusively for numbers. But it does imply a type of knowledge that can be reliably parceled out in public, without constant need for verification or interpretation.Yet there is one much more radical contributor to our post-truth politics that could ultimately be as transformative of our society as accounting proved to be 500 years ago.We are in the middle of a transition from a society of facts to a society of data. During this interim, confusion abounds surrounding the exact status of knowledge and numbers in public life, exacerbating the sense that truth itself is being abandoned.The place to start in understanding this transition is with the spread of \u201csmart\u201d technologies into everyday life, sometimes called the \u201cinternet of things.\u201d Thanks to the presence of smartphones and smartcards in our pockets, the dramatic uptake of social media, the rise of e-commerce as a means of purchasing goods and services, and the spread of sensory devices across public spaces, we leave a vast quantity of data in our wake as we go about our daily activities.Like statistics or other traditional facts, this data is quantitative in nature. What\u2019s new is both its unprecedented volume (the \u201cbig\u201d in big data) and also the fact that it is being constantly collected by default, rather than by deliberate expert design. Numbers are being generated much faster than we have any specific use for. But they can nevertheless be mined to get a sense of how people are behaving and what they are thinking.The promise of facts is to settle arguments between warring perspectives and simplify the issues at stake. For instance, politicians might disagree over the right economic policy, but if they can agree that \u201cthe economy has grown by 2 percent\u201d and \u201cunemployment is 5 percent,\u201d then there is at least a shared stable reality that they can argue over.The promise of data, by contrast, is to sense shifts in public sentiment. By analyzing Twitter using algorithms, for example, it is possible to get virtually real-time updates on how a given politician is perceived. This is what\u2019s known as \u201csentiment analysis.\u201dThere are precedents for this, such as the \u201cworm\u201d that monitors live audience reaction during a televised presidential debate, rising and falling in response to each moment of a candidate\u2019s rhetoric. Financial markets represent the sentiments of traders as they fluctuate throughout the day. Stock markets never produce a fact as to what Cisco is worth in the way that an accountant can; they provide a window into how thousands of people around the world are feeling about Cisco, from one minute to the next.Journalists and politicians can no more ignore a constant audit of collective mood than C.E.O.s can ignore the fluctuations in their companies\u2019 share prices. If the British government had spent more time trying to track public sentiment toward the European Union and less time repeating the facts of how the British economy benefited from membership in the union, it might have fought the Brexit referendum campaign differently and more successfully.Dominic Cummings, one of the leading pro-Brexit campaigners, mocked what he called outdated polling techniques. He also asked one pollster to add a question on \u201centhusiasm,\u201d and, employing scientists to mine very large, up-to-the-minute data sets, to gauge voter mood and to react accordingly with ads and voter-turnout volunteers.It is possible to live in a world of data but no facts. Think of how we employ weather forecasts: We understand that it is not a fact that it will be 75 degrees on Thursday, and that figure will fluctuate all the time. Weather forecasting works in a similar way to sentiment analysis, bringing data from a wide range of sensory devices, and converting this into a constantly evolving narrative about the near future.However, this produces some chilling possibilities for politics. Once numbers are viewed more as indicators of current sentiment, rather than as statements about reality, how are we to achieve any consensus on the nature of social, economic and environmental problems, never mind agree on the solutions?Conspiracy theories prosper under such conditions. And while we will have far greater means of knowing how many people believe those theories, we will have far fewer means of persuading them to abandon them.William Davies is an associate professor in political economy at Goldsmiths, University of London, and the author of \u201cThe Happiness Industry: How the Government and Big Business Sold Us Well-Being.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple, Congress and the Missing Taxes", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "Supported byEditorialApple and the United States are crying foul over the ruling in Europe that Apple received illegal tax breaks from Ireland and must hand over 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion), a record tax penalty in Europe.But Apple and the United States have only themselves to blame for the situation.Initially, deferral was a convenience for multinationals, as they sought investment opportunities abroad. Today, it is the taproot of global tax avoidance. Financial engineering has let American companies shift profits into foreign accounts, while they lobby Congress for tax-rate cuts in exchange for repatriating the money. Currently, there is some $2 trillion in corporate profits in offshore tax-deferred accounts; besides Apple, Microsoft, Google, Cisco and Oracle also have large stashes. Apple is one of nearly two dozen major corporations pushing Congress for a \u201ctax holiday,\u201d which would let companies bring back foreign-held money over the course of a year at a discounted tax rate, rather than the current rate, 35 percent.Before the European ruling on Tuesday, the debate over a tax holiday had pitted Republicans, who have generally favored the idea, against Democrats, who have viewed it as an unjustified reward for tax avoidance. The Democrats have history on their side. A tax holiday in 2005 lowered the corporate rate to 5.25 percent, enticing corporations to repatriate some $300 billion. It was billed as a way to create jobs and increase investment, but the money was used mostly for dividend payments, share buybacks (which tend to raise executive pay) and severance for laid-off employees. Worse, the tax holiday inspired multinationals to stash as much money abroad as they possibly could in anticipation of another holiday.The European ruling, however, could sharply alter the terms of the congressional debate. Republicans and Democrats alike have always assumed that foreign-held profits would one day be repatriated. The big question was the rate at which they would ultimately be taxed. Similarly, the Treasury assumes that deferred foreign profits will one day be taxed when it projects future revenues \u2014 an important measure of the nation\u2019s fiscal health.But the money won\u2019t be repatriated and taxed under American law if Europeans, in the course of enforcing their own laws against tax havens, get their hands on it first. And that, in a nutshell, is why members of Congress and Treasury officials are so upset about the Apple ruling. They understand, correctly, that tax-law enforcement in Europe could reduce the sums they expect to collect taxes on someday. What they don\u2019t understand, or aren\u2019t saying, is that they brought the problem on themselves.The way forward is not to declare a tax war with Europe. It is for Congress to agree on a way to tax foreign-held corporate profits. President Obama put forth a reasonable approach in 2015, when he proposed a mandatory 14 percent tax on multinationals\u2019 current offshore profits \u2014 whether they are repatriated or not \u2014 and, thereafter, a new minimum tax rate of 19 percent on profits moved offshore. An even better approach would be to simply end indefinite corporate tax deferral, imposing American taxes on profits when they are made.Republicans rejected Mr. Obama\u2019s proposal in 2015, and there is no chance that lawmakers will engage in such a debate so close to the election. But the next president and Congress will need to act to ensure that at long last, American corporations pay their fair share in taxes.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Once Taunted by Steve Jobs, Companies Are Now Big Customers of Apple", "Date": "2016-08-07", "News": "Supported byThese days, the same could be said about Apple. Even IBM is promoting Apple gear.Apple\u2019s iPhones and iPads have become the preferred mobile computing devices for corporations, as industries from insurers to airlines aim to ditch bulky PCs and give their employees the ability to do their jobs from anywhere using smartphones or tablets.\u201cApple is stronger in the enterprise market with its devices than it is with consumers,\u201d said Frank Gillett, an industry analyst at Forrester.Pinpointing exact figures for Apple\u2019s corporate sales is difficult. Apple said growth was strong but declined to disclose recent numbers. During its last fiscal year, which ended in September, Apple said it sold $25 billion in gear and services to companies and other large customers. While that was only about 11 percent of the company\u2019s overall revenue, those business sales were up 40 percent from the previous year. That\u2019s compared with 28 percent growth for the entire business.Companies are turning to Apple\u2019s products for their tight-knit hardware and software, advanced security features and intuitive interfaces. Aiding Apple\u2019s corporate sales has been a concern that phones and tablets running Google\u2019s Android software, which are generally cheaper and popular with consumers, have lagged in the security technology and the standardization that companies want.For British Airways, which has built more than 40 custom iPad apps for its work force, switching to tablets has eliminated reams of paper used for flight plans, passenger manifests and maintenance records. Another app allows anyone at the airline to grab an iPad and quickly rebook passengers when a flight is canceled or weather wreaks havoc on schedules.\u201cWe can get to customers wherever they are,\u201d said Abigail Comber, who is in charge of the customer experience at the airline. \u201cIt\u2019s technology that\u2019s very intuitive. What the team has managed to do brilliantly is take away everything that happens on the back end.\u201d The carrier has so far deployed its apps across 17,000 iPads, and is looking to digitize even more of its business.Apple says it is focused on creating great devices \u2014 for all customers. \u201cWe\u2019re dedicated to building products that make people\u2019s lives better, often in ways that we couldn\u2019t have even imagined, enabling them to do things that they have never done before,\u201d Susan Prescott, vice president of worldwide product marketing, markets and applications, said in a statement. \u201cOur goal with business customers is the same \u2014 to enable them to do something great with mobile and truly modernize and transform their business.\u201dApple\u2019s increased attention to business customers has not come without internal angst.\u201cApple totally recognizes that their products are being used in a workplace context and not just at home,\u201d Mr. Gillett said. \u201cBut they are rabidly focused on making the world better for individual users. They have a strong fear if they begin to think too much about their enterprise customers, they will compromise the consumer experience.\u201dApple runs three-day boot camps for companies at its campus in Cupertino, Calif., to help them rapidly build prototype apps. But it was not an approach that could be scaled up to thousands of corporate customers.Hence Apple\u2019s decision to team up with other companies that specialize in catering to businesses. As Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, quipped at an industry conference last September: \u201cLife is short. We\u2019re going to die soon. And you\u2019ve got to have as many friends as you can.\u201dMahmoud Naghshineh, IBM\u2019s general manager for the Apple partnership, says Apple\u2019s devices appeal to companies that need to manage complex processes. IBM\u2019s strategy is to develop apps for specific industries, then customize them for each customer.Claims adjusters at Amica Mutual Insurance, for example, recently began using an IBM iPad app to collect information on claims, take photos, record statements and gain access to individual customer files. \u201cThe adjuster in the future will be able to complete their entire job on the iPad,\u201d said Adam Kostecki, an Amica manager involved in the project.Many companies are forging ahead on their own. Lowe\u2019s, the home improvement retailer, has built five iPod apps. One allows store employees to pull up reviews with 360-degree views of products, check inventory and guide customers to the exact location of a product within its warehouse-size outlets.Other apps allow employees to match a carpet pattern and estimate how much a customer would need to cover a given area. Inspired by the iPhone-based checkout system at Apple stores, Lowe\u2019s has even written a checkout app that it is testing in its two Manhattan stores.\u201cIf you think about devices that a lot of retailers provide to their associates, they aren\u2019t user-friendly. They are sometimes very old technology,\u201d said Eric Hanson, the director of digital experience at Lowe\u2019s. \u201cOur associates were deserving of an experience that was the same as we gave to our customers.\u201dVan Baker, an analyst at the Gartner research firm who studies mobile technology in businesses, said that most companies are just beginning to explore how mobile devices can transform their businesses. \u201cFor the vast majority of enterprises, mobile usage extends to email, contacts and calendars,\u201d he said.That opens up opportunities that Apple is cautiously pursuing.\u201cCook has taken a pragmatic approach without changing Apple\u2019s culture,\u201d Mr. Gillett, the Forrester analyst, said. Apple\u2019s philosophy, he said, is, \u201cWe want to stick to our knitting, what we\u2019re really good at \u2014 devices and software experiences for individuals \u2014 and work with others to translate Apple\u2019s strengths into the workplace.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Every Company Is a Tech Company, Does the Label Matter?", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "Supported byStrategiesApple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon have created something of a watershed moment in the stock market.They became the four most valuable companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index at the close of trading on Aug. 1, according to S.&P.\u2019s official tally. That meant that tech companies, by one common definition, occupied the four top spots in the market capitalization rankings, a rare and brief occurrence.\u201cIt may never have happened before at the close of trading,\u201d said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. The full history of daily rankings isn\u2019t readily available, however, so we can\u2019t be certain, and such rankings are evanescent, shifting with every tick of the stock market. In fact, on Friday, Amazon dropped back into sixth place.But no matter: The early August rankings were a reminder of how far tech has come. It is a dominant force in the stock market and the economy, one so all-encompassing that tech may no longer even be a useful concept for understanding today\u2019s stock market.One of them is Exxon Mobil, the energy giant and the most valuable company in the S.&P. as recently as 2012. But Exxon Mobil has been cut down in size by the oil price debacle. The other is Berkshire Hathaway, Warren E. Buffett\u2019s conglomerate, which the S.&P. categorizes as a financial services company \u2014 the only such company left in the Top 10 market cap list. Berkshire announced its own earnings after trading closed on Friday. We\u2019ll soon learn whether the market is pleased enough to vault Berkshire further ahead of Amazon.The three tech companies at the very top in market cap \u2014 Apple, Google and Microsoft \u2014 have held high positions for a long while. (Google, ranked second, trades as Alphabet, the name of its parent company.) Google passed Apple in value briefly this year, but Apple regained the top perch, which it has held since 2012. Microsoft, now No. 3, was the most valuable company during the last tech boom, in the early 2000s.Virtually no one disputes S.&P.\u2019s formal classification of Apple, Google and Microsoft as \u201cinformation technology\u201d companies. The same is true of Facebook, which held seventh place in the latest list of most valuable companies. But while Amazon is often described as a tech company \u2014 and undoubtedly uses and creates innovative technology \u2014 S.&P. has never classified it as one.In fact, Amazon is formally known as a \u201cconsumer discretionary company,\u201d like Walmart, which it has displaced as a member of the Top 10 most valuable companies. Amazon is the only consumer discretionary company left in the Top 10. Is it in some sense a tech company? Certainly, and we\u2019ll get back to that.But the same can be said, to one degree or another, about the three other members of the Top 10 \u2014 old companies that are still prospering in large part because of their mastery of advanced technologies. Johnson & Johnson, for example, which is ranked eighth, is a health care company, yet it is heavily involved in technology of a biological kind. Then there is General Electric, the diversified industrial company (and, until recently, also a financial services company), once described as a bellwether for the entire market. It conducts advanced research and sells tech products.Last on the list is AT&T, a telecommunications company, which, in an early form, helped create computer languages and operating systems on which modern tech companies are built. In 1957, when the S.&P. 500 was born, an ancestral version of AT&T was the most valuable company in the United States by a very wide margin, said Jeremy J. Siegel, a Wharton business school professor, the author of \u201cStocks for the Long Run\u201d and a market historian.\u201cAT&T back then was a highly regulated old phone company,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a giant, later broken up into smaller companies. And it was an outlier, because the other big companies in the S.&P. 500 in that era were mainly materials companies \u2014 like United States Steel, DuPont and Union Carbide \u2014 and an awful lot of oil companies.\u201dIn 1957, the economy ran on oil, and the biggest energy company was Standard Oil of New Jersey \u2014 an ancestor of Exxon Mobil. No pure tech company ranked in the Top 10 back then, not even IBM, which soon became the dominant tech company, a position it held until Microsoft surpassed it in the mid-1990s. That was the decade of the great tech boom, culminating in the bubble that burst in March 2000. Microsoft was No. 1 in market cap at the end of 1999, and four other tech companies \u2014 Cisco Systems, Intel, IBM and America Online \u2014 were also among the Top 10 most valuable companies. The stock market celebrated tech\u2019s ascendance then, as it does now.But this is a different era. When you dig deeper into the S.&P. 500, it\u2019s clear that while the valuations of tech companies swelled to unrealistically high proportions in those bubble years, the valuations of most companies are far more modest now. In March 2000, the height of the bubble, the value of information technology companies swelled to 34.5 percent of the total market cap of the S.&P. 500. At the moment, the comparable figure is only 20.7 percent, data from the Bespoke Investment Group shows. That\u2019s not much more than the 15.7 percent share of financial companies or the 15.2 percent share of the health care sector. By contrast, finance ballooned as high as 22.3 percent at the end of 2006, in what can be seen in hindsight as a financial bubble.On the other hand, materials and energy companies, which together constituted almost half of the total value of the S.&P. 500 in 1957, now account for less than 10 percent of it. That reflects the collapse of energy and commodity prices over the last few years, and it may well be a temporary phenomenon. In the meantime, diversified energy companies like Exxon Mobil are investing heavily in technology, a necessity if they are to flourish.It\u2019s clear even to energy companies, in other words, that tech\u2019s abiding power in the marketplace is not temporary. Technology permeates every sector of the economy, even those not formally classified as high-tech. Whether companies like Amazon and Johnson & Johnson should carry tech labels is beside the point. Tech has already taken over.These days every company is a tech company, but some have better niches, faster growth, more attractive offerings or more favorable share prices than others. These kinds of fundamental distinctions will influence the Top 10 rankings of the future.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Once Taunted by Steve Jobs, Companies Are Now Big Customers of Apple", "Date": "2016-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThese days, the same could be said about Apple. Even IBM is promoting Apple gear.Apple\u2019s iPhones and iPads have become the preferred mobile computing devices for corporations, as industries from insurers to airlines aim to ditch bulky PCs and give their employees the ability to do their jobs from anywhere using smartphones or tablets.\u201cApple is stronger in the enterprise market with its devices than it is with consumers,\u201d said Frank Gillett, an industry analyst at Forrester.Pinpointing exact figures for Apple\u2019s corporate sales is difficult. Apple said growth was strong but declined to disclose recent numbers. During its last fiscal year, which ended in September, Apple said it sold $25 billion in gear and services to companies and other large customers. While that was only about 11 percent of the company\u2019s overall revenue, those business sales were up 40 percent from the previous year. That\u2019s compared with 28 percent growth for the entire business.Companies are turning to Apple\u2019s products for their tight-knit hardware and software, advanced security features and intuitive interfaces. Aiding Apple\u2019s corporate sales has been a concern that phones and tablets running Google\u2019s Android software, which are generally cheaper and popular with consumers, have lagged in the security technology and the standardization that companies want.For British Airways, which has built more than 40 custom iPad apps for its work force, switching to tablets has eliminated reams of paper used for flight plans, passenger manifests and maintenance records. Another app allows anyone at the airline to grab an iPad and quickly rebook passengers when a flight is canceled or weather wreaks havoc on schedules.\u201cWe can get to customers wherever they are,\u201d said Abigail Comber, who is in charge of the customer experience at the airline. \u201cIt\u2019s technology that\u2019s very intuitive. What the team has managed to do brilliantly is take away everything that happens on the back end.\u201d The carrier has so far deployed its apps across 17,000 iPads, and is looking to digitize even more of its business.Apple says it is focused on creating great devices \u2014 for all customers. \u201cWe\u2019re dedicated to building products that make people\u2019s lives better, often in ways that we couldn\u2019t have even imagined, enabling them to do things that they have never done before,\u201d Susan Prescott, vice president of worldwide product marketing, markets and applications, said in a statement. \u201cOur goal with business customers is the same \u2014 to enable them to do something great with mobile and truly modernize and transform their business.\u201dApple\u2019s increased attention to business customers has not come without internal angst.\u201cApple totally recognizes that their products are being used in a workplace context and not just at home,\u201d Mr. Gillett said. \u201cBut they are rabidly focused on making the world better for individual users. They have a strong fear if they begin to think too much about their enterprise customers, they will compromise the consumer experience.\u201dApple runs three-day boot camps for companies at its campus in Cupertino, Calif., to help them rapidly build prototype apps. But it was not an approach that could be scaled up to thousands of corporate customers.Hence Apple\u2019s decision to team up with other companies that specialize in catering to businesses. As Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, quipped at an industry conference last September: \u201cLife is short. We\u2019re going to die soon. And you\u2019ve got to have as many friends as you can.\u201dMahmoud Naghshineh, IBM\u2019s general manager for the Apple partnership, says Apple\u2019s devices appeal to companies that need to manage complex processes. IBM\u2019s strategy is to develop apps for specific industries, then customize them for each customer.Claims adjusters at Amica Mutual Insurance, for example, recently began using an IBM iPad app to collect information on claims, take photos, record statements and gain access to individual customer files. \u201cThe adjuster in the future will be able to complete their entire job on the iPad,\u201d said Adam Kostecki, an Amica manager involved in the project.Many companies are forging ahead on their own. Lowe\u2019s, the home improvement retailer, has built five iPod apps. One allows store employees to pull up reviews with 360-degree views of products, check inventory and guide customers to the exact location of a product within its warehouse-size outlets.Other apps allow employees to match a carpet pattern and estimate how much a customer would need to cover a given area. Inspired by the iPhone-based checkout system at Apple stores, Lowe\u2019s has even written a checkout app that it is testing in its two Manhattan stores.\u201cIf you think about devices that a lot of retailers provide to their associates, they aren\u2019t user-friendly. They are sometimes very old technology,\u201d said Eric Hanson, the director of digital experience at Lowe\u2019s. \u201cOur associates were deserving of an experience that was the same as we gave to our customers.\u201dVan Baker, an analyst at the Gartner research firm who studies mobile technology in businesses, said that most companies are just beginning to explore how mobile devices can transform their businesses. \u201cFor the vast majority of enterprises, mobile usage extends to email, contacts and calendars,\u201d he said.That opens up opportunities that Apple is cautiously pursuing.\u201cCook has taken a pragmatic approach without changing Apple\u2019s culture,\u201d Mr. Gillett, the Forrester analyst, said. Apple\u2019s philosophy, he said, is, \u201cWe want to stick to our knitting, what we\u2019re really good at \u2014 devices and software experiences for individuals \u2014 and work with others to translate Apple\u2019s strengths into the workplace.\u201dAdvertisement"}
