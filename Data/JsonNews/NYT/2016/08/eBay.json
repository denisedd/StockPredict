{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine Show New Tax Returns, Pressuring Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHillary Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, released a new batch of their own income tax returns on Friday, ratcheting up the pressure on her opponent, Donald J. Trump, to begin making public his own forms.They paid about $3.6 million in federal taxes for an effective tax rate of about 35 percent.More than half their income came from speeches; Mrs. Clinton also earned $3 million from \u201cHard Choices,\u201d her memoir of her years as secretary of state.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s spokeswoman, Jennifer Palmieri, said in a statement the release sets a \u201cstark contrast\u201d with Mr. Trump, whom she accused of \u201chiding behind fake excuses.\u201dThe income taxes of Mrs. Clinton, along with her husband, former President Bill Clinton, showed an adjusted gross income of $10.6 million for 2015, which were released Friday.\u201cHe has failed to provide the public with the most basic financial information disclosed by every major candidate in the last 40 years,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is he trying to hide?\u201dThe Trump campaign would not discuss his tax returns, but in a statement on Friday, a spokesman, Jason Miller, called Mrs. Clinton\u2019s disclosure an effort to shield her from questions about her emails when she was secretary of state and about what favors were sought by donors to her family\u2019s foundation.\u201cThis document release is nothing more than an attempt at distraction and misdirection by an individual who created and then purged an illegal private email server,\u201d he said.While Mr. Trump has cited an I.R.S. audit as his reason for not releasing his taxes, the agency said in a statement this year, \u201cNothing prevents individuals from sharing their own tax information.\u201dThe lack of a disclosure of his taxes has opened Mr. Trump to attacks, first during the Republican primary campaign and now in the months leading to the Nov. 8 general election.Mr. Kaine, the Virginia senator and Hillary Clinton's running mate, and his wife, Anne Holton, reported income of $313,441 for 2015, which was released Friday.Given the expansive web of tax breaks available to real estate developers, tax experts say it would not be surprising if Mr. Trump paid little or no income taxes some years, even as he amassed billions of dollars in wealth.The Clintons\u2019 income has also brought scrutiny, and their returns hint at how much they have relied on their star power and government connections to catapult them into the ranks of the super rich. Though they were once seen as relatable to average Americans, polls suggest that many voters now see them as out of touch.Their 2015 income, while less than half what they earned the previous year, put them well above the $2 million threshold for the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers, according to an analysis of federal income tax data by Emmanuel Saez, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley. They were within $1 million of reaching the 0.01 percent threshold \u2014 or the top 1 percent of the top 1 percent.In recent years they have collected tens of millions of dollars in fees for speeches, including some delivered abroad and others sponsored by financial institutions.Almost all presidential nominees since 1976 have made their tax returns public, most around Tax Day in April  \u2014 about 200 days before the election.In 2015, before she officially began her campaign and stopped giving speeches, she earned $1.5 million in speaking fees. Her husband earned $5.25 million from speeches last year.According to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s personal financial disclosure filed in May, she and her husband made more than two dozen speeches in 2015 for $150,000 and up. Mr. Clinton earned $225,000 for a February speech sponsored by UBS Wealth Management, for example, and Mrs. Clinton gave a speech for eBay in March for $315,000. Mr. Clinton also earned $1.7 million from his consulting business, WJC L.L.C., after it brought in more than $6 million the year before, according to the tax returns.These financial ties \u2014 including the past speeches, business endeavors and well as donor relationships with the Clinton Foundation \u2014 have already attracted critics who say they include inherent conflicts of interest and could be problematic under a Clinton administration.From 2007 to 2015, according to returns released Friday and previously, the Clintons made a total adjusted gross income of $150 million and paid $48 million in federal taxes. In the same period they gave $16 million to charity, including $1 million last year that went mostly to their family foundation.The Clintons\u2019 other income last year included $24,932 in interest, $84,358 in mutual fund dividends and $226,297 in pension payments from the federal and Arkansas governments.Their deductions included $1.4 million in state income taxes and $98,244 in property taxes on their homes in Chappaqua, N.Y., and Washington. They also wrote off $41,040 in mortgage interest.David Barstow contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Kim and Kanye. Brad and Angelina. Bill and Hillary. Batman and Robin.An exhibition at the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington is adding a twist to the formula, and contemplating the enduring star power of another dynamic duo: Will and Jane.That\u2019s Jane Austen, you rattlepate. True, she and William Shakespeare never met in person (outside the kinkier reaches of fan fiction, that is). But their parallel cultural afterlives illuminate the process by which some great authors are transformed into icons, beloved almost as much for their imagined personalities and our feelings of intimacy with them as for anything they wrote.Old-school Shakespeareans may blanch at seeing Will and Jane bobbleheads on the exhibition poster \u2014 to say nothing of the prospect of bonnet-wearing Janeites flocking to the Folger\u2019s hushed Tudor-style halls to swoon over the shirt worn (wet) by Colin Firth in his indelible turn as Mr. Darcy in the 1995 BBC adaptation of \u201cPride and Prejudice.\u201d\u201cShakespeare was almost a kind of cheesy pop-culture phenomenon in the 18th century,\u201d said Janine Barchas, an Austen expert at the University of Texas who curated the show with Kristina Straub, a Shakespeare scholar at Carnegie Mellon University.\u201cWhen you look at how his reputation was formed, and then grew,\u201d she continued, \u201cit\u2019s very similar to what we\u2019re seeing with Austen now, and the way that pop culture creates a foundation for high culture.\u201d\u201cAt the end of the day, they\u2019re just sticks,\u201d Ms. Straub said. \u201cBut they\u2019re also being treasured in a vault, taking up valuable real estate. It should make you laugh, but it also tells you something about the nature of celebrity that you need to take seriously.\u201dThe exhibition was born out of a rather unserious conversation four years ago over a breakfast burrito. Michael Witmore, the Folger\u2019s director, was in Austin, Tex., for a conference, and caught up with Ms. Barchas, who teased him about the fact that \u201cmy author is really giving your author a run for his money,\u201d as she recalled it.After a rambling debate they hit, half-seriously, on a loose concept.\u201cWhat if these two people were lovable roommates, like Will & Grace, or Laverne & Shirley?\u201d Witmore recalled. \u201cIt really just started with the title. There was absolutely no scholarly thinking.\u201dThe resulting show, which arrives during the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare\u2019s death and a year ahead of the 200th anniversary of Austen\u2019s, mixes deep scholarship with serious whimsy. It does not tell a linear story but instead groups its artifacts thematically, taking care to keep the two writers alongside each other.Even beyond sheer literary genius, the curators argue, Shakespeare and Austen have a lot in common \u2014 starting with their scantily recorded intimate lives, which leave tantalizing holes to fill.One display tracks the way devotees of both authors, who were captured in only a handful of portraits, improved their images. (The likeness of Austen that will appear next year on the British 10-pound note is based on a Victorian portrait commissioned by the family in 1869, more than 50 years after Austen\u2019s death, to prettify a casual sketch made by her sister, Cassandra.)Fans have also tended to prettify their love lives with embellished or invented romances, whether a forged love letter from Shakespeare to his wife, Anne Hathaway, that was created in the 1790s, or films like \u201cShakespeare in Love\u201d or \u201cBecoming Jane,\u201d which depicts Austen\u2019s falling in doomed love with a penniless lawyer, only to end up pursuing the lonely creative life.The show also examines how both authors\u2019 names have been used in marketing, whether on a signboard for the Shakespeare\u2019s Head tavern, from the late-17th or early-18th century, or an empty shoe box from a 1970s line of women\u2019s footwear named, for obscure reasons, Jane Austen.The Shirt is displayed near a series of homages, like a photographic re-enactment featuring Benedict Cumberbatch, and as a parallel Shakespearean example, a series of 18th-century porcelains showing famous actors as Richard III.Repetition \u201cis a powerful reinforcing mechanism of celebrity,\u201d a display text explains. \u201cThe cultural value of an image increases the more it is copied.\u201dJane Austen\u2019s House Museum, which now owns the ring, declined to lend it to the Folger, forcing the exhibition to make do with a gold copy. But it did send a collection of domestic objects discovered under the house\u2019s floorboards, including a nail and a clay pipe. It also sent a framed lock of Austen\u2019s hair, now displayed alongside a single strand of auburn hair attributed to Shakespeare, which first surfaced for sale in the early 19th century.\u201cWe didn\u2019t\u2019 have it DNA-tested,\u201d Ms. Barchas said jokingly. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to dispel the myth.\u201dThe show doesn\u2019t entirely neglect more traditional literary artifacts. There are Shakespeare and Austen volumes owned by famous people, like James Joyce\u2019s coffee-splattered copy of \u201cAs You Like It\u201d and the actor Stephen Fry\u2019s student paperback of \u201cMansfield Park,\u201d complete with \u201cstrange annotations, circa 1977,\u201d as an inscription explains.A display called \u201cThe End?\u201d looks at the way some admirers seek total communion, even in death. The curators quote a letter from the director of Jane Austen\u2019s House Museum, who in 2008 implored Janeites not to direct their heirs to scatter their ashes on the grounds.\u201cIt is distressing for visitors,\u201d she noted, \u201cto see mounds of human ash.\u201dBut the Folger itself is a mausoleum. As the show notes, the ashes of Henry Clay Folger and Emily Folger, the library\u2019s founders, are interred in the nearby reading room behind a plaque paying tribute to \u201cthe glory of William Shakespeare and the greater glory of God.\u201d\u201cWith that kind of idolatry, your first instinct may be to snicker,\u201d Ms. Barchas said. \u201cBut then you have to stop and think seriously about what it is that you yourself love about literature.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But who was he to judge? I asked Priebus if he could assure Republicans that he, their esteemed leader, had himself never sent pictures of his G.O.P. genitalia to strangers. He chuckled.\u201cI am a Boy Scout,\u201d he promised.But was he really?Actually a Cub Scout, Reince said, quickly moving to clarify his record. I asked him if he had seen what Trump had tweeted about Huma and Anthony Monday afternoon while he was in the air. \u201cNo, what\u2019d he say?\u201d Priebus said with a barely detectable flash of terror in his voice. (What room did the Rottweiler trash now?) I told him that Trump praised Abedin for \u201ca very wise decision\u201d and that he then went on to accuse Hillary Clinton of being \u201ccareless and negligent in allowing Weiner to have such close proximity to highly classified information.\u201d (There is zero proof that Clinton did such a thing). \u201cIt is possible that our country and its security have been greatly compromised by this,\u201d Trump persisted, though it\u2019s unclear exactly how Weiner\u2019s handiwork compromised anything more than what was left of Weiner\u2019s dignity.\u201cIs this the kind of thing your nominee should be weighing in on?\u201d I asked Priebus.\u201cWell, look, I don\u2019t really get involved with this,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cI just landed. But clearly the guy is a scoundrel and has problems.\u201dWho, Weiner or Trump?\u201cAnthony.\u201dOne bit of housecleaning from the Republican primaries: I asked Priebus about the pledges that the R.N.C. asked its presidential candidates to sign last year promising they would support the party\u2019s eventual nominee. What became of those? (Are they on eBay?) They remain a bit of a sore spot with Priebus, given that the last two Republican candidates to bow out of the primaries, Ted Cruz and John Kasich, are still not supporting Trump and seem in no hurry to pledge allegiance. Priebus pointed out that in exchange for signing the pledge and promising their support for the Republican standard-bearer, the candidates received voter data from the R.N.C. \u201cI think they should honor their word,\u201d Priebus said. Could Cruz and Kasich face sanction from the party if they seek the nomination again? \u201cIf they want to run one day, the issue of not supporting the party\u2019s nominee is going to be an issue for them,\u201d he said. But that will be a moot point in 2020, he added, \u201cbecause we will have an incumbent president in the White House.\u201dIn which case, I asked, where Priebus would be? Did he want to be an ambassador to somewhere?\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cWisconsin.\u201dBefore we finished, I asked Priebus to leave us with another trademark bit of his homespun Wisconsin wisdom. Last week he shared a cryptic-yet-profound warning against lighting fireworks on a patio (\u201cThey leave black marks\u201d). This time, Priebus had no guidance at the ready for us. \u201cYou gotta tell me these things before we have these discussions,\u201d Priebus protested.

But after Mr. Christie withdrew from the campaign and endorsed Mr. Trump, Ms. Whitman excoriated the New Jersey governor for what she said was an \u201castonishing display of political opportunism.\u201dOn Tuesday, Ms. Whitman said she had not spoken to Mr. Christie since he endorsed Mr. Trump, and pointedly noted that she had not changed her view of his decision.Ms. Whitman, who said she would remain a Republican, brings with her a considerable network of contributors, some of whom she said were open to giving to Mrs. Clinton. She said she was willing to campaign for Mrs. Clinton, said she would do her best to gather checks for her campaign and indicated she would personally give to both Mrs. Clinton and her affiliated \u201csuper PACs.\u201d An aide to Ms. Whitman said she would personally give at least an amount in the \u201cmid-six figures\u201d to the Clinton effort.While Democrats openly appealed at their convention last week to Republicans uneasy with Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton and her top supporters have been making a similar cross-party pitch in private since before the Democratic nomination fight even came to its conclusion.Ms. Whitman said that she did not commit to supporting Mrs. Clinton when they talked on the phone last month, and that Mrs. Clinton had offered no assurances on how she would govern. But Ms. Whitman called it \u201ca lovely chat\u201d that included a discussion of economic issues.She said she had told Mrs. Clinton that she wanted to see the two parties\u2019 conventions and assess the running mates that each nominee chose before making her decision. When Mrs. Clinton selected Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, a consensus-oriented figure, \u201cthat was a positive for me,\u201d Ms. Whitman said.\u201cI don\u2019t agree with her on very many issues,\u201d she added, \u201cbut she would be a much better president than Donald Trump.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Even Uber Couldn\u2019t Bridge the China Divide", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtTravis Kalanick, the co-founder and chief executive of the ride-hailing giant Uber, often defended his eagerness to risk billions on winning the Chinese market with a simple question: If you have a chance to become Amazon and Alibaba at the same time, why not try?The implication was simple. Over the last couple of decades, Amazon, Facebook, Google and other American technology giants have each followed a similar script for world domination. Like an imperial armada rolling out from North America\u2019s West Coast, these companies would try to establish beachheads on every other continent.But when American giants tried to enter the waters of China, the world\u2019s largest internet market, the armada invariably ran aground.Plagued by opaque and ever-shifting regulations and a culturally abstruse way of doing business, American companies fell to a series of local giants. Instead of Google, Baidu. Instead of Facebook, WeChat, owned by the giant Tencent. And instead of Amazon, Alibaba.That has left us with a divide: Today, there is the Chinese internet, and there is the internet of the rest of the world. A network seen in its early days as a tool to foster financial and political unity across a fragmented planet has irrevocably cleaved into two completely separate spheres.Entrepreneurs across the globe can choose to win in China or the rest of the world. You can be Alibaba or you can be Amazon. You can be Uber or you can be Didi. But you can\u2019t be both. Given the rising Chinese market and increasing tension over the role of American tech firms in the rest of the globe, the gulf between the two sides promises to become one of the most important factors in determining the shape of global tech innovation.How exactly might the war play out? In some ways, being at the mercy of two poles of internet leadership could be good for citizens of planet Earth. In emerging markets like India, the Middle East and parts of Africa and South America, the giants of China and the United States are increasingly investing billions to compete for local customers in e-commerce, social networking, ride sharing and other markets.\u201cAmazon is increasingly making its own branded products, taking on Procter & Gamble and others, and also getting into the logistics business, and shipping, and everything else,\u201d Mr. Clark said. \u201cBut Alibaba is a marketplace that doesn\u2019t hold inventory and describes themselves as helping local merchants \u2014 so maybe there\u2019s some argument that Alibaba could serve as a counter globally to Amazon.\u201d\u201cIn that way it could be like the Yalta Conference,\u201d said Mr. Clark, referring to the 1945 meeting in which the victors of World War II determined the postwar geopolitical order.\u201cThe barrels that will be thrown at you when you\u2019re trying to do business in China will just never stop,\u201d said Mark Natkin, the managing director of Marbridge Consulting, an advisory firm based in Beijing. \u201cYou\u2019ll constantly be above one barrel or recovering from jumping one, and as you\u2019re dusting yourself off you look down the road and here comes the next one.\u201dCompared with previous failures, Uber seemed to do everything right in China. It set up a separate company, Uber China, which had a buy-in from local investors, including from a local giant, Baidu. It hired many local experts, and worked closely with the national government to foster friendly relations.Insiders say Mr. Kalanick was also personally invested in the deal. He visited China eight times in the last year and a half, and became something of a tech star in the Chinese media.Publicly Mr. Kalanick had insisted he was fighting for total victory in China. But he must have known that Uber would always struggle to achieve dominance, given the emerging centrality of ride-sharing to the future of infrastructure in China. Still, even if he failed to win everything in China, investing early in the country seemed too big to skip.For now, it\u2019s especially delicious frosting. The $2 billion Uber spent tackling China is now worth about $7 billion in the new merged entity; if Didi does become one of China\u2019s largest tech companies, the value of Uber\u2019s stake in China could rise geometrically, making the firm much more attractive in a potential initial public offering. Pulling out of China also frees up Uber to invest more in other markets \u2014 India and Indonesia are big targets \u2014 as well as expand its expertise in core technological initiatives like mapping data and self-driving cars.But if spending big to tackle China ultimately works out for Uber, it will be an anomaly, and certainly not a model for other American tech giants.\u201cThe ride-sharing market is one the few markets where the upside is big enough to justify going in,\u201d Mr. Thompson said. \u201cFor most other companies, going into China is still going to be nothing but pain.\u201dEmail: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber to Sell to Rival Didi Chuxing and Create New Business in China", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Uber\u2019s future in China seemed to hold promise.The sale, which would create a new company worth about $35 billion, would end the great ride-hailing battle of China. A person with knowledge of the deal said Uber investors had been pushing for such a transaction.The companies have been fighting relentlessly for market share in mainland China for two years, spending tens of millions of dollars every month to attract riders and drivers. The merger would end that competition and create significant scale, but it would also be a repudiation of Uber\u2019s ambitions to take on local Chinese competitors in their huge home market.Uber had pushed its way into a country that has gone almost untouched by major American tech companies in recent years. Its progress was widely watched and discussed by entrepreneurs and investors alike as a model for how to reach China\u2019s 600 million internet users \u2014 a forbidding prospect considering the country\u2019s well-funded local competitors and regulations aimed at blocking foreign businesses.With the deal, the company will join the ranks of American peers like Google and eBay, which were unable to capitalize on early footholds in China. EBay was outmaneuvered by Alibaba, while Google left China after it said it was the target of government-sponsored cyberattacks.Still, it is by no means a financial catastrophe for Uber, which for about $2 billion of investment in the Chinese market gets a $7 billion share in a company that is likely to grow. It also saves the cash it may have spent competing in China for other projects.\u201cHowever, as an entrepreneur, I\u2019ve learned that being successful is about listening to your head as well as following your heart,\u201d he wrote. \u201cUber and Didi Chuxing are investing billions of dollars in China and both companies have yet to turn a profit there.\u201dUnder the terms of the deal, the new company\u2019s estimated worth is a combination of Didi Chuxing\u2019s $28 billion valuation and Uber China\u2019s $7 billion, according to two people with knowledge of the deal, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the information had not yet been made public. Uber shareholders would receive a 20 percent stake in the new company.Over the past two years, Uber upended expectations in China and its business there grew, despite heavy regulation and internet filters that often limit access to the products of foreign tech companies. The early 2015 rollout of People\u2019s Uber, a service that got ordinary Chinese drivers behind the wheel and taking passengers, helped Uber grab a chunk of market share from Didi.As it grew in China, Uber avoided many of the mistakes made by of its American tech forebears. For one, the company created local teams based around different cities, allowing it to respond quickly and flexibly to moves by the competition. That set it apart from other companies, which sought to control Chinese operations from the United States, slowing their responses.But entry is just the first obstacle to the Chinese internet market. Competition is fierce, and the focus is less on the product than on big spending to lure customers or on tricks to harm competitors. Fraudsters and opportunists also abound.Uber\u2019s engineers, operating from San Francisco, had to deal with drivers who simulated or faked rides to get commissions. At the same time, the company was blocked from marketing on China\u2019s biggest social network, WeChat, because the internet giant Tencent was an early investor in Didi. All of that made it much harder to compete with a company that already had an advantage in scale, not to mention the backing of Tencent, Alibaba and Apple. When it raised $7 billion in June, Didi made it clear it was willing to continue the fight for a long time.For all the publicity around the spat between Uber and Didi, the two had been in talks stretching back to the Didi-Kuaidi merger in the beginning of 2015, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. That person said the two sides could not overcome disagreements about valuations at the time.In another quirk to the latest deal, two members of the same well-known family in the world of technology were on opposite sides of the negotiating table: Didi\u2019s president, Jean Liu, is the daughter of Liu Chuanzhi, the Chinese founder of the largest computer maker in the world, Lenovo. Her cousin, Zhen Liu, is a vice president and regular spokeswoman for Uber China.Although the tie-up is expected to reassure investors, Chinese analysts said it would probably lead to a decrease in commissions. That could hurt customers and drivers alike, the analysts said, making it harder for smaller players to compete because their larger rival would no longer be saddled with such an expense.\u201cFor smaller companies like Yidao or Shenzhou, if they keep subsidizing users, it will only be temporary and will bring more financial burdens,\u201d said Hong Bo, an independent technology analyst in China.Li Bo, a 22-year-old driver from Henan, said the loyalty of drivers is determined by where they could get the best pay. That meant they would continue to follow the subsidies, he said.\u201cAll we care is who gives us the best deal,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Didi buys Uber, we just work for Didi. It doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201dPaul Mozur reported from Hong Kong, and Mike Isaac from San Francisco. Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting from New York.

{"Headline": "The Artist Nick Cave Gets Personal About Race and Gun Violence", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "Supported by\u201cIt\u2019s the biggest space I\u2019ve ever worked in, and that\u2019s pushing me out of my comfort zone,\u201d said the energetic Mr. Cave. He was preparing \u201cUntil,\u201d a massive, immersive installation slated to open Oct. 16 that will also be Mass MoCA\u2019s costliest, most elaborate exhibition to date.Mr. Cave gave a reporter a peek when he was in residence here for a few weeks, working constantly and staying nearby. It was a chance to see how Mr. Cave\u2019s mind works (fast, but very precisely) and how one of the most popular contemporary artists turns his serious ideas into buoyant aesthetic concepts.Three and a half years in the making, \u201cUntil\u201d is what Mr. Cave called his most personal work to date. It will lead visitors on a path through an enchanted but menacing landscape featuring, among other things, 17 black-faced lawn jockeys on a crystal cloudscape 18 feet in the air; 20,000 whirling wind spinners; a \u201cwaterfall\u201d of shimmering foil-like strips; a thousand or so intentionally garish ceramic tchotchkes; and several million beads, some of which will comprise shimmering mountains. For the time being, some of those components were heaped in riotous piles in the museum\u2019s basement, and others in Mr. Cave\u2019s studio in Chicago, where he is based.The title has a straightforward meaning, he added: \u201cInnocent until proven guilty, guilty until proven innocent.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a black male. The moment I step outside of the privacy of my space, I am viewed differently.\u201dHe sometimes toiled alone at night in the basement rooms that hold the work\u2019s many components. \u201cI only have to walk two blocks to get to the hotel,\u201d he said of his commute in the wee hours. \u201cBut in two blocks, your life can change forever.\u201dMr. Cave, 57, is best known for his \u201cSoundsuits,\u201d the wearable, noise-making costumes that entertain while they raise questions about race, gender and identity.Although \u201cUntil\u201d is unusual in its lack of an aural component, the work is a next-level amalgamation of everything he knows about sculpture, performance and audience engagement.Asked how fans of his \u201cSoundsuits\u201d should think about this new work, Mr. Cave, a graceful and powerful sort who once studied with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, mimed the motion of scooping out his own stomach and raising it up as an offering.\u201cThis is me putting you into the belly of a \u2018Soundsuit,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s me grabbing you by the hand and saying, \u2018Let\u2019s jump into the \u2018Soundsuit.\u2019\u201dMr. Cave talks with his arms \u2014 not in the way of a point-making politician, but as if he were trying to sculpt the very air around him.Visitors are meant to be included \u2014 and implicated \u2014 in the work, as they will be able to see one another in peekaboo vistas across the vast installation. \u201cIt\u2019s about being able to face one another,\u201d Mr. Cave said. \u201cWe can no longer hide behind the surface.\u201dNor will Mr. Cave hide. He will do a single performance as part of a once-a-month activation of the installation, although details are still being worked out.It\u2019s been long-planned, but there\u2019s an improvisational element in \u201cUntil\u201d at this stage, because its size allows for endless fine-tuning.\u201cI sort of water the garden,\u201d Mr. Cave said of his evening sessions. \u201cWhen they come in in the mornings, there\u2019s something new.\u201dHe pointed to a several small fake Christmas trees that he had attached to metal rings and topped with a cartoonish crown, the product of a recent weekend visit to the workroom. A couple of days later, Mr. Cave started to arrange colorful marbles on the back of a 10-foot fiberglass crocodile but realized bigger marbles worked better. An intern was dispatched to a local antiques market to buy more.He admitted that the scale and scope were daunting \u2014 Building 5 stretches over nearly 18,000 square feet \u2014 as was the institution\u2019s reputation.\u201cPeople are traveling from all over the world to come to Mass MoCA,\u201d Mr. Cave said. \u201cYou better be damn sure you have something worth coming to.\u201dMany hands are involved to make \u201cUntil,\u201d including the 10 or so assistants working in Mr. Cave\u2019s Chicago studio, and Mass MoCA\u2019s staff.Denise Markonish, the Mass MoCA curator who has been coordinating with Mr. Cave on the exhibition for more than three years, said that it was a \u201cbeautiful nightmare.\u201dShe added, \u201cIt seduces you and then punches you in the gut.\u201dFor Mass MoCA\u2019s director, Joseph C. Thompson, the comparison was a decadent, superabundant scene in a Dutch still-life painting.\u201cThere\u2019s something a little rotten,\u201d Mr. Thompson said. \u201cThere\u2019s a pot of honey, but there are some flies on it.\u201dAt their sit-down, she pulled out a plan of Building 5 and said, \u201c2016. It\u2019s as big as a football field, and I don\u2019t want you to make any \u2018Soundsuits.\u2019\u201dThe \u201cSoundsuits\u201d do make an appearance in a video at the far end of \u201cUntil.\u201d Mr. Cave wears one, made with a vintage chicken mask covering his head, as he runs around frantically. \u201cIt\u2019s about feeling trapped,\u201d he said of the video. \u201cTime is running out.\u201dFor her part, Ms. Markonish has been involved in the project in ways that go beyond her official job description, including finding a lawn jockey on eBay and going to pick it up personally.\u201cIt was within 45 minutes of my family\u2019s house, so I thought I\u2019d go get it and save money on shipping,\u201d Ms. Markonish said.When she arrived, the house had a sign saying \u201cwhite trash,\u201d and she had to tell the owner, \u201cI\u2019m here to pick up the lawn jockey.\u201dThe errand gave her pause. \u201cEven those words coming out of my mouth was just really intense,\u201d Ms. Markonish said.The paradisiacal landscape where the jockeys appear \u2014 made from the crystals that would normally go into chandeliers, on a raised platform accessible via four ladders \u2014 is the heart of \u201cUntil.\u201d\u201cI had been thinking about gun violence and racism colliding,\u201d Mr. Cave said. \u201cAnd then I wondered: Is there racism in heaven? That\u2019s how this piece came about.\u201dThe jockeys appear to have a special symbolism for Mr. Cave, though he said he did not see a lot of them on lawns when he was growing up in Missouri in the 1960s \u2014 \u201cthank god,\u201d he added.He recounted the possibly apocryphal origin of the figures: On a cold winter night, an African-American boy who served George Washington during the Revolutionary War was asked to keep watch on the horses and light the way until Washington returned. But the boy froze to death, in the familiar pose holding a lantern.\u201cIt\u2019s such a repressive image,\u201d Mr. Cave said, adding that it was the element of fruitless loyalty that bothered him the most.In his installation, however, the jockeys will be holding elaborately beaded butterfly nets, which Mr. Cave also called \u201cdream catchers,\u201d giving \u201cUntil\u201d a hopeful aspect.\u201cThere\u2019s a lightness to them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about this state of enlightenment, and living with a sense of uncertainty in the most magnificent way.\u201dAnd with that, Mr. Cave went back to work for an evening session amid his bric-a-brac \u2014 there were still miles to go to get \u201cUntil\u201d up and running.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Do-It-Yourself Fashion Thrives at the McCall Pattern Company", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe internet did little to disrupt it. Globalization could not shut it down. But while the McCall Pattern Company, the home-sewing brand founded in 1863, may seem like a business that time forgot, it finds itself newly fashionable.The company\u2019s headquarters have the look of a corporate environment in the days before digital culture banished clutter. There on the 34th floor of the Equitable Building, a 1915 skyscraper in Manhattan\u2019s financial district, you will find rooms filled with buttons and zippers, bolts of fabric on work tables and metal file drawers stuffed with paper pattern packets.There is a patternmaking room, where muslin is fitted to dress forms; a dressmaking room, where women at sewing machines make sample garments; and a photo studio, where models pose for simple shoots that emphasize the clothes, rather than sex or sizzle.For the 80 or so employees, home sewing is not so much a retro thing as it is a timeless pursuit.\u201cI\u2019ve done this long enough to know that people have it in their hearts,\u201d said Carolyne Cafaro, the creative director. \u201cThere could be one pattern company left in the world, but I do think people will always sew.\u201dMs. Cafaro\u2019s brief is to oversee the creation of some 700 patterns each year for the four lines that fall under the McCall Pattern Company banner. Each of the lines \u2014 McCall\u2019s, Butterick, Kwik Sew and Vogue Patterns (its name licensed from Cond\u00e9 Nast) \u2014 has its own catalog, which sewing enthusiasts find at fabric shops.Meg McDonald, who two years ago became the company\u2019s first social media manager, said she was troubled recently when she came across a photo of one of McCall\u2019s distinctively illustrated envelopes in a nostalgic \u201cDo You Remember?\u201d post on Facebook. There it was, a representation of the company she works for, alongside rotary phones and carousel slide projectors taken from the collective cultural attic.\u201cSo here\u2019s a perfect example of the \u2018Huh, you guys are still in business?\u2019 thing that happens to us all the time,\u201d Ms. McDonald wrote in an email.But if there is a sense in the broader culture that the McCall Pattern Company belongs to the Betty Draper past, the opposite view is held among 21st-century sewers. The patterns created here are blueprints, essential enablers for do-it-yourself-minded women and men who want to look stylish without plunking down thousands at a department store or the latest pop-up shop.9 PhotosA new appreciation for artisanal crafts has led the Etsy generation to embrace sewing. Once done mainly out of economic necessity, making clothes at home is back in fashion, relatively speaking.Lately, McCall has been mining its past to build a bridge to the future, posting images from its impressive archive to social media sites like Instagram and Pinterest. One of the publications showing its wares, Vogue Patterns, is a fashion treasure trove, and looking through old issues underscores the historical ties between the pattern companies, high fashion and Hollywood.Famous faces jump out on almost every page. There\u2019s Iman and Christie Brinkley modeling sportswear at the dawn of their careers in October 1977. There\u2019s Alexander Liberman, the legendary Cond\u00e9 Nast art director, on the masthead in an issue in 1958. And isn\u2019t that a baby-faced Marc Jacobs posed beside a girl wearing the striped jacket and pants he designed for Perry Ellis in 1990?Vogue Patterns was always the high-fashion bible for the advanced sewer, and the work from the star designers that appeared in its pages, including Givenchy, Christian Dior and Valentino, dispelled the notion that homemade clothing was frumpy or for the members of religious cults.For those who love the substance of fashion more than the hoopla that surrounds it, working for Vogue Patterns was \u2014 and is \u2014 the ultimate.\u201cThis is going to sound corny, but Vogue Patterns was my dream job,\u201d Ms. Cafaro said. \u201cMy mother and grandmother sewed and taught me to sew when I was young. I really loved it.\u201d16 PhotosBut the energetic Ms. Cafaro may be better suited to the more wide-ranging job of creative director. \u201cI have the attention span of a gnat,\u201d she said.She started in the industry in the late 1970s, selling Vogue Patterns in Bloomingdale\u2019s, and she remembers with fondness the luxe days, when she and her colleagues traveled to Europe to meet with designers. \u201cWe would take 10- to 12-day trips to Paris, London, Milan,\u201d she said. \u201cLife was good.\u201dPart of the goal of posting the archive images, said Ms. McDonald, is to spark curiosity among young people, many of whom were not taught sewing in school. To liven up its product, McCall has struck deals with popular sewing bloggers and turned them into designers.Ms. Hirsch, who blogs under the name Gertie and dresses in a retro rockabilly way, has appeared on the cover of the Butterick catalog and releases \u201cPatterns by Gertie.\u201dAnother blogger turned designer, who works for the McCall\u2019s line, is Nikki Brooks-Revis, 36. She began sewing only four years ago, she said, after amending her long-held view: \u201cMy thought was old people sew. Young, hip people did not sew.\u201dMs. Brooks-Revis started a personal fashion blog and discovered sewing as a way to produce an ever-changing wardrobe on a budget. She loved the way she could alter a pattern and customize a garment.Sewing patterns were, in a sense, the original fast fashion: a quick, affordable, stylish option before the advent of the $20 H & M dress. One of the company\u2019s greatest hits is the Walkaway dress, a Butterick pattern from 1952.\u201cIt was called the Walkaway dress because you could sit down at a sewing machine in the morning and walk away wearing it to lunch,\u201d Ms. Cafaro said. The pattern is still available in the Butterick catalog, reissued for a new generation.Many McCall employees exhibit the same constancy as the patterns: They have been with the company for decades. There\u2019s a family atmosphere among the staff and an awareness that they occupy a unique place in the industry, far from the hype of Times Square billboards and runways teeming with pouty fashion bots.Behnaz Livian, an Iranian immigrant and director of the patternmaking department, has worked at McCall for 26 years. Gwenn Wright, a dressmaker, has been there 33 years. Frank Rizzo, the chief executive, used to work with Ms. Cafaro at Simplicity patterns, a rival company. After all these years he can\u2019t operate a sewing machine. \u201cDon\u2019t bring it up,\u201d he said. \u201cThey threatened to make me learn to sew.\u201dPenny Payne, who oversees the fabric library, went to work for Vogue-Butterick in 1987 after a modeling career. One recent afternoon, wearing a blue Donna Karan dress, a Vogue Patterns design she picked up at the office sample sale, Ms. Payne sat at a work table.A bright space filled with large flip boards affixed with the latest swatches, buttons, zippers and other notions, the library is the hub of the McCall office, a crucial resource for the designers, fashion editors and patternmakers, who must know what\u2019s available on the market for home sewers.The pattern business is a dynamic crossroads of several industries, Ms. Payne said. \u201cThe timing and the schedules feel like publishing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s trend and fashion, so it\u2019s like a magazine. But we actually produce something.\u201dBehind her were color-trend boards from a presentation she gave the day before to representatives from the crafts chain Hobby Lobby. \u201cMy skill set has so many different layers, and all of it would not be used at another company,\u201d Ms. Payne said. \u201cI feel blessed to be a part of it.\u201dThe four staff designers expressed a similar satisfaction, despite the workload: At any time they may be focused on 20 to 30 pattern styles, each with three or four variations.Jacqueline Polikoff, who designs for the McCall\u2019s brand, joined the company five years ago after working for a junior contemporary line in mass manufacturing. Although she no longer sees her designs in stores, she said it was surprisingly rewarding to see how home sewers interpret her patterns.\u201cAt the end of the day, they\u2019re the designer,\u201d said Ms. Polikoff, who notices when sewers post their outfits to social media.Carlos Correa, who has been at the company 25 years and now designs for the Vogue Patterns line, once worked at Elie Tahari and as Geoffrey Beene\u2019s assistant. But he became disillusioned. \u201cThe things the magazines would go crazy about would end up living in the archives,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody actually bought them.\u201dMr. Correa still deals with Seventh Avenue; about half the styles for Vogue Patterns are licensed from well-known companies like Badgley Mischka, Tracy Reese and Rachel Comey. But, he said: \u201cYou get to see people making these things and wearing them in real life. And creatively, it\u2019s very fulfilling.\u201dThe pattern industry isn\u2019t wholly immune to modern realities. McCall and its competitors have introduced downloadable patterns as a nod to changing times.They have also faced business challenges due to changes in how people shop. Last February, the chain Hancock Fabrics filed for bankruptcy, closing 185 stores. The cause, in part, was the consumers\u2019 shift to buying online.Smaller independent fabric stores have also closed, leaving McCall ever more reliant on the big craft chains like Jo-Ann and Hobby Lobby. Budget and staff cuts have caused its employees to take on more roles.

{"Headline": "Do-It-Yourself Fashion Thrives at the McCall Pattern Company", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "Supported byThe internet did little to disrupt it. Globalization could not shut it down. But while the McCall Pattern Company, the home-sewing brand founded in 1863, may seem like a business that time forgot, it finds itself newly fashionable.The company\u2019s headquarters have the look of a corporate environment in the days before digital culture banished clutter. There on the 34th floor of the Equitable Building, a 1915 skyscraper in Manhattan\u2019s financial district, you will find rooms filled with buttons and zippers, bolts of fabric on work tables and metal file drawers stuffed with paper pattern packets.There is a patternmaking room, where muslin is fitted to dress forms; a dressmaking room, where women at sewing machines make sample garments; and a photo studio, where models pose for simple shoots that emphasize the clothes, rather than sex or sizzle.For the 80 or so employees, home sewing is not so much a retro thing as it is a timeless pursuit.\u201cI\u2019ve done this long enough to know that people have it in their hearts,\u201d said Carolyne Cafaro, the creative director. \u201cThere could be one pattern company left in the world, but I do think people will always sew.\u201dMs. Cafaro\u2019s brief is to oversee the creation of some 700 patterns each year for the four lines that fall under the McCall Pattern Company banner. Each of the lines \u2014 McCall\u2019s, Butterick, Kwik Sew and Vogue Patterns (its name licensed from Cond\u00e9 Nast) \u2014 has its own catalog, which sewing enthusiasts find at fabric shops.Meg McDonald, who two years ago became the company\u2019s first social media manager, said she was troubled recently when she came across a photo of one of McCall\u2019s distinctively illustrated envelopes in a nostalgic \u201cDo You Remember?\u201d post on Facebook. There it was, a representation of the company she works for, alongside rotary phones and carousel slide projectors taken from the collective cultural attic.\u201cSo here\u2019s a perfect example of the \u2018Huh, you guys are still in business?\u2019 thing that happens to us all the time,\u201d Ms. McDonald wrote in an email.But if there is a sense in the broader culture that the McCall Pattern Company belongs to the Betty Draper past, the opposite view is held among 21st-century sewers. The patterns created here are blueprints, essential enablers for do-it-yourself-minded women and men who want to look stylish without plunking down thousands at a department store or the latest pop-up shop.9 PhotosA new appreciation for artisanal crafts has led the Etsy generation to embrace sewing. Once done mainly out of economic necessity, making clothes at home is back in fashion, relatively speaking.Lately, McCall has been mining its past to build a bridge to the future, posting images from its impressive archive to social media sites like Instagram and Pinterest. One of the publications showing its wares, Vogue Patterns, is a fashion treasure trove, and looking through old issues underscores the historical ties between the pattern companies, high fashion and Hollywood.Famous faces jump out on almost every page. There\u2019s Iman and Christie Brinkley modeling sportswear at the dawn of their careers in October 1977. There\u2019s Alexander Liberman, the legendary Cond\u00e9 Nast art director, on the masthead in an issue in 1958. And isn\u2019t that a baby-faced Marc Jacobs posed beside a girl wearing the striped jacket and pants he designed for Perry Ellis in 1990?Vogue Patterns was always the high-fashion bible for the advanced sewer, and the work from the star designers that appeared in its pages, including Givenchy, Christian Dior and Valentino, dispelled the notion that homemade clothing was frumpy or for the members of religious cults.For those who love the substance of fashion more than the hoopla that surrounds it, working for Vogue Patterns was \u2014 and is \u2014 the ultimate.\u201cThis is going to sound corny, but Vogue Patterns was my dream job,\u201d Ms. Cafaro said. \u201cMy mother and grandmother sewed and taught me to sew when I was young. I really loved it.\u201d16 PhotosBut the energetic Ms. Cafaro may be better suited to the more wide-ranging job of creative director. \u201cI have the attention span of a gnat,\u201d she said.She started in the industry in the late 1970s, selling Vogue Patterns in Bloomingdale\u2019s, and she remembers with fondness the luxe days, when she and her colleagues traveled to Europe to meet with designers. \u201cWe would take 10- to 12-day trips to Paris, London, Milan,\u201d she said. \u201cLife was good.\u201dPart of the goal of posting the archive images, said Ms. McDonald, is to spark curiosity among young people, many of whom were not taught sewing in school. To liven up its product, McCall has struck deals with popular sewing bloggers and turned them into designers.Ms. Hirsch, who blogs under the name Gertie and dresses in a retro rockabilly way, has appeared on the cover of the Butterick catalog and releases \u201cPatterns by Gertie.\u201dAnother blogger turned designer, who works for the McCall\u2019s line, is Nikki Brooks-Revis, 36. She began sewing only four years ago, she said, after amending her long-held view: \u201cMy thought was old people sew. Young, hip people did not sew.\u201dMs. Brooks-Revis started a personal fashion blog and discovered sewing as a way to produce an ever-changing wardrobe on a budget. She loved the way she could alter a pattern and customize a garment.Sewing patterns were, in a sense, the original fast fashion: a quick, affordable, stylish option before the advent of the $20 H & M dress. One of the company\u2019s greatest hits is the Walkaway dress, a Butterick pattern from 1952.\u201cIt was called the Walkaway dress because you could sit down at a sewing machine in the morning and walk away wearing it to lunch,\u201d Ms. Cafaro said. The pattern is still available in the Butterick catalog, reissued for a new generation.Many McCall employees exhibit the same constancy as the patterns: They have been with the company for decades. There\u2019s a family atmosphere among the staff and an awareness that they occupy a unique place in the industry, far from the hype of Times Square billboards and runways teeming with pouty fashion bots.Behnaz Livian, an Iranian immigrant and director of the patternmaking department, has worked at McCall for 26 years. Gwenn Wright, a dressmaker, has been there 33 years. Frank Rizzo, the chief executive, used to work with Ms. Cafaro at Simplicity patterns, a rival company. After all these years he can\u2019t operate a sewing machine. \u201cDon\u2019t bring it up,\u201d he said. \u201cThey threatened to make me learn to sew.\u201dPenny Payne, who oversees the fabric library, went to work for Vogue-Butterick in 1987 after a modeling career. One recent afternoon, wearing a blue Donna Karan dress, a Vogue Patterns design she picked up at the office sample sale, Ms. Payne sat at a work table.A bright space filled with large flip boards affixed with the latest swatches, buttons, zippers and other notions, the library is the hub of the McCall office, a crucial resource for the designers, fashion editors and patternmakers, who must know what\u2019s available on the market for home sewers.The pattern business is a dynamic crossroads of several industries, Ms. Payne said. \u201cThe timing and the schedules feel like publishing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s trend and fashion, so it\u2019s like a magazine. But we actually produce something.\u201dBehind her were color-trend boards from a presentation she gave the day before to representatives from the crafts chain Hobby Lobby. \u201cMy skill set has so many different layers, and all of it would not be used at another company,\u201d Ms. Payne said. \u201cI feel blessed to be a part of it.\u201dThe four staff designers expressed a similar satisfaction, despite the workload: At any time they may be focused on 20 to 30 pattern styles, each with three or four variations.Jacqueline Polikoff, who designs for the McCall\u2019s brand, joined the company five years ago after working for a junior contemporary line in mass manufacturing. Although she no longer sees her designs in stores, she said it was surprisingly rewarding to see how home sewers interpret her patterns.\u201cAt the end of the day, they\u2019re the designer,\u201d said Ms. Polikoff, who notices when sewers post their outfits to social media.Carlos Correa, who has been at the company 25 years and now designs for the Vogue Patterns line, once worked at Elie Tahari and as Geoffrey Beene\u2019s assistant. But he became disillusioned. \u201cThe things the magazines would go crazy about would end up living in the archives,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody actually bought them.\u201dMr. Correa still deals with Seventh Avenue; about half the styles for Vogue Patterns are licensed from well-known companies like Badgley Mischka, Tracy Reese and Rachel Comey. But, he said: \u201cYou get to see people making these things and wearing them in real life. And creatively, it\u2019s very fulfilling.\u201dThe pattern industry isn\u2019t wholly immune to modern realities. McCall and its competitors have introduced downloadable patterns as a nod to changing times.They have also faced business challenges due to changes in how people shop. Last February, the chain Hancock Fabrics filed for bankruptcy, closing 185 stores. The cause, in part, was the consumers\u2019 shift to buying online.Smaller independent fabric stores have also closed, leaving McCall ever more reliant on the big craft chains like Jo-Ann and Hobby Lobby. Budget and staff cuts have caused its employees to take on more roles. The trips to the fashion capitals of Europe are a thing of the past.Five months after the Hancock bankruptcy, McCall employees were still digesting the fact that one of their largest retail partners was kaput.

Facebook was a college social site before it became a global media hub; Amazon was a bookseller before it was, well, everything.Joe MacMillan (Lee Pace), a mysterious, smooth-talking drifter of a businessman, was paired with Gordon Clark (Scoot McNairy), a brilliant but failed engineer, in a sketchy scheme to bring an IBM clone to market. As a plot, it was less than inspiring, and as a character story, less than inspired: an 8-bit Don Draper and a Walter White who dealt in megabytes rather than meth.But at the end of its first season, \u201cHalt\u201d did something almost unheard-of in television, if not in tech: It upended its entire project. With the introduction of the Apple Macintosh, Joe and Gordon discovered that they had been chasing yesterday\u2019s dream. They were thinking too small, too incrementally. The quest of the entire season had been a failure of imagination.The headlines then were about computing power coming to your desktop. But the long-term change, barely glimmering in the days of telephone modems, lay in the connection of every desktop to every other. It was the birth of the social internet, where we now live.Season 2 followed Mutiny, a nascent online gaming company started by Gordon\u2019s wife, Donna (Kerry Bish\u00e9), and Cameron Howe (Mackenzie Davis), an impassioned sparkplug of a programmer.For all practical purposes, the series changed not just its focus but its lead characters. Cameron was visionary but impractical; Donna relished the new start but chafed at being forced into the role of the buzz kill adult in the room. (Ms. Bish\u00e9 gave a nuanced, undersung performance.)This was something we hadn\u2019t seen so often before: a tricky but fruitful alliance between two women in a male-dominated industry. Cameron had the digital native\u2019s instinct to see the online world as a place of constant invention. Donna had the emotional intelligence to notice that Mutiny\u2019s social component \u2014 its chat rooms \u2014 was the future of the future.Season 3, which begins on Tuesday, continues the show\u2019s iterative-learning process, picking up in 1986, as Mutiny has relocated from Texas to Silicon Valley and is beginning to reconceive itself one more time. (Cameron and Donna have noticed their gamers\u2019 taking over Mutiny chat to negotiate real-world trades \u2014 shades of Craigslist or eBay.)The growing pains continue, throwing the women into the unfamiliar and testosterone-heavy world of venture capitalists. \u201cIt only takes one of them to ask you to the dance,\u201d says their consigliere, John Bosworth (Toby Huss). Cameron replies, \u201cI love how even the metaphors in this business are sexist.\u201d They find a possible ally in Diane (Annabeth Gish), a sympathetic but bluntly honest investor.Gordon has come along in tow, feeling at loose ends in a managerial role at Mutiny. The chameleonic Joe, meanwhile, has landed in California as the head of a software-security firm, sporting a Steve Jobsian beard and speaking in pretentious koans. (\u201cI\u2019ve been accused of selling fear,\u201d he tells a rapt audience. \u201cBut let me ask you: Is it fear or is it truth?\u201d)Joe\u2019s re-reinvention as a smug tech guru suits Mr. Pace, a striking but peculiar presence whom the show has struggled to use effectively. (He was well cast in the \u201cHobbit\u201d movies as the frosty, Eurotrash-y elven king Thranduil.) He seems fully at home now, strutting around his office listening to Gary Numan music, carrying himself like a human Patrick Nagel print.The new season takes time to reset, and the movement in the early episodes is slow. The character dynamics are solid, though, and the \u201980s details continue to be spot on. (At a fancy Valley restaurant, Donna stumbles over the pronunciation of a trendy new dish: risotto.)But any well-produced period piece can recreate bygone days. \u201cHalt\u201d lets you see them as the cusp of bracing change. The real product in its tech business isn\u2019t hardware or software \u2014 it\u2019s tomorrow, and \u201cHalt and Catch Fire\u201d makes its past future feel dewy and new.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Artist Nick Cave Gets Personal About Race and Gun Violence", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cIt\u2019s the biggest space I\u2019ve ever worked in, and that\u2019s pushing me out of my comfort zone,\u201d said the energetic Mr. Cave. He was preparing \u201cUntil,\u201d a massive, immersive installation slated to open Oct. 16 that will also be Mass MoCA\u2019s costliest, most elaborate exhibition to date.Mr. Cave gave a reporter a peek when he was in residence here for a few weeks, working constantly and staying nearby. It was a chance to see how Mr. Cave\u2019s mind works (fast, but very precisely) and how one of the most popular contemporary artists turns his serious ideas into buoyant aesthetic concepts.Three and a half years in the making, \u201cUntil\u201d is what Mr. Cave called his most personal work to date. It will lead visitors on a path through an enchanted but menacing landscape featuring, among other things, 17 black-faced lawn jockeys on a crystal cloudscape 18 feet in the air; 20,000 whirling wind spinners; a \u201cwaterfall\u201d of shimmering foil-like strips; a thousand or so intentionally garish ceramic tchotchkes; and several million beads, some of which will comprise shimmering mountains. For the time being, some of those components were heaped in riotous piles in the museum\u2019s basement, and others in Mr. Cave\u2019s studio in Chicago, where he is based.The title has a straightforward meaning, he added: \u201cInnocent until proven guilty, guilty until proven innocent.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a black male. The moment I step outside of the privacy of my space, I am viewed differently.\u201dHe sometimes toiled alone at night in the basement rooms that hold the work\u2019s many components. \u201cI only have to walk two blocks to get to the hotel,\u201d he said of his commute in the wee hours. \u201cBut in two blocks, your life can change forever.\u201dMr. Cave, 57, is best known for his \u201cSoundsuits,\u201d the wearable, noise-making costumes that entertain while they raise questions about race, gender and identity.Although \u201cUntil\u201d is unusual in its lack of an aural component, the work is a next-level amalgamation of everything he knows about sculpture, performance and audience engagement.Asked how fans of his \u201cSoundsuits\u201d should think about this new work, Mr. Cave, a graceful and powerful sort who once studied with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, mimed the motion of scooping out his own stomach and raising it up as an offering.\u201cThis is me putting you into the belly of a \u2018Soundsuit,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s me grabbing you by the hand and saying, \u2018Let\u2019s jump into the \u2018Soundsuit.\u2019\u201dMr. Cave talks with his arms \u2014 not in the way of a point-making politician, but as if he were trying to sculpt the very air around him.Visitors are meant to be included \u2014 and implicated \u2014 in the work, as they will be able to see one another in peekaboo vistas across the vast installation. \u201cIt\u2019s about being able to face one another,\u201d Mr. Cave said. \u201cWe can no longer hide behind the surface.\u201dNor will Mr. Cave hide. He will do a single performance as part of a once-a-month activation of the installation, although details are still being worked out.It\u2019s been long-planned, but there\u2019s an improvisational element in \u201cUntil\u201d at this stage, because its size allows for endless fine-tuning.\u201cI sort of water the garden,\u201d Mr. Cave said of his evening sessions. \u201cWhen they come in in the mornings, there\u2019s something new.\u201dHe pointed to a several small fake Christmas trees that he had attached to metal rings and topped with a cartoonish crown, the product of a recent weekend visit to the workroom. A couple of days later, Mr. Cave started to arrange colorful marbles on the back of a 10-foot fiberglass crocodile but realized bigger marbles worked better. An intern was dispatched to a local antiques market to buy more.He admitted that the scale and scope were daunting \u2014 Building 5 stretches over nearly 18,000 square feet \u2014 as was the institution\u2019s reputation.\u201cPeople are traveling from all over the world to come to Mass MoCA,\u201d Mr. Cave said. \u201cYou better be damn sure you have something worth coming to.\u201dMany hands are involved to make \u201cUntil,\u201d including the 10 or so assistants working in Mr. Cave\u2019s Chicago studio, and Mass MoCA\u2019s staff.Denise Markonish, the Mass MoCA curator who has been coordinating with Mr. Cave on the exhibition for more than three years, said that it was a \u201cbeautiful nightmare.\u201dShe added, \u201cIt seduces you and then punches you in the gut.\u201dFor Mass MoCA\u2019s director, Joseph C. Thompson, the comparison was a decadent, superabundant scene in a Dutch still-life painting.\u201cThere\u2019s something a little rotten,\u201d Mr. Thompson said. \u201cThere\u2019s a pot of honey, but there are some flies on it.\u201dAt their sit-down, she pulled out a plan of Building 5 and said, \u201c2016. It\u2019s as big as a football field, and I don\u2019t want you to make any \u2018Soundsuits.\u2019\u201dThe \u201cSoundsuits\u201d do make an appearance in a video at the far end of \u201cUntil.\u201d Mr. Cave wears one, made with a vintage chicken mask covering his head, as he runs around frantically. \u201cIt\u2019s about feeling trapped,\u201d he said of the video. \u201cTime is running out.\u201dFor her part, Ms. Markonish has been involved in the project in ways that go beyond her official job description, including finding a lawn jockey on eBay and going to pick it up personally.\u201cIt was within 45 minutes of my family\u2019s house, so I thought I\u2019d go get it and save money on shipping,\u201d Ms. Markonish said.When she arrived, the house had a sign saying \u201cwhite trash,\u201d and she had to tell the owner, \u201cI\u2019m here to pick up the lawn jockey.\u201dThe errand gave her pause. \u201cEven those words coming out of my mouth was just really intense,\u201d Ms. Markonish said.The paradisiacal landscape where the jockeys appear \u2014 made from the crystals that would normally go into chandeliers, on a raised platform accessible via four ladders \u2014 is the heart of \u201cUntil.\u201d\u201cI had been thinking about gun violence and racism colliding,\u201d Mr. Cave said. \u201cAnd then I wondered: Is there racism in heaven? That\u2019s how this piece came about.\u201dThe jockeys appear to have a special symbolism for Mr. Cave, though he said he did not see a lot of them on lawns when he was growing up in Missouri in the 1960s \u2014 \u201cthank god,\u201d he added.He recounted the possibly apocryphal origin of the figures: On a cold winter night, an African-American boy who served George Washington during the Revolutionary War was asked to keep watch on the horses and light the way until Washington returned. But the boy froze to death, in the familiar pose holding a lantern.\u201cIt\u2019s such a repressive image,\u201d Mr. Cave said, adding that it was the element of fruitless loyalty that bothered him the most.In his installation, however, the jockeys will be holding elaborately beaded butterfly nets, which Mr. Cave also called \u201cdream catchers,\u201d giving \u201cUntil\u201d a hopeful aspect.\u201cThere\u2019s a lightness to them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about this state of enlightenment, and living with a sense of uncertainty in the most magnificent way.\u201dAnd with that, Mr. Cave went back to work for an evening session amid his bric-a-brac \u2014 there were still miles to go to get \u201cUntil\u201d up and running.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Daily Report: What Tech Happens in China Stays in China", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "Supported byBitsTo get a good sense of tech in China, it\u2019s useful to think about the last 5,000 years, particularly as they relate to a big event this week.China has 50 centuries of history, which along with its huge population can make the rest of us seem like something of a rounding error. That\u2019s one of several things that often makes China\u2019s market unique in the world, along with a strong nationalist streak, local innovation and good old-fashioned protectionism.Whichever of these you consider paramount, they create a strangely familiar outcome in Uber\u2019s decision to sell its China operations to Didi Chuxing, the local version of Uber\u2019s ride-hailing service.In the business of technology infrastructure, China has also been a tough market. Cisco Systems manages to sell some products, but it has lost much business to Huawei, a Chinese maker of internet gear. Cisco once sued Huawei, accusing it of copying Cisco\u2019s stuff, but it now says relations are fine. They are, except Huawei executives privately fume at the difficulties they have entering the American market.The way Cisco and Huawei dominate their home markets and the way local Chinese cloud companies are likely to have a big role in China but little elsewhere for now suggest a likely fate for Didi-Uber: The Chinese company gets its big market, and the Americans get theirs, and much of the world besides. Don\u2019t expect to see a big push by Didi in, say, Europe, where Uber already has operations.For now. After all, China is a huge market. When you\u2019ve got 5,000 years of history, it\u2019s easy to play a long game.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Olympic Cover-Up: Why You Won\u2019t See Some Shoe Logos", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "Supported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The track and field events at the Rio Olympics this month will showcase elite athletic talent and, if you look closely, creative subterfuge.Tape, markers, elastic sleeves and maybe even paint will disguise some shoe brand logos in an Olympic sleight of foot.In track and field, the centerpiece sport of the Summer Games, shoes are the most vital piece of equipment and serve purposes beyond performance: supplying advertising billboards for apparel companies and providing financial footing for athletes. But some athletes do not want the world to see the logos on their shoes, or they are prohibited from doing so by their sponsors if they wear competing brands.Although United States track and field athletes at the Rio Games must wear uniforms bearing the familiar swoosh of Nike, an official team sponsor, they are free to wear their own brand of shoes, disguised or not.Take, for example, Jeremy Taiwo, a decathlete from Seattle who will wear eight pairs of shoes in his 10 events, each with a function as specific as a golf club\u2019s.His shoe sponsor is Brooks, but the company does not make shoes designed for throwing and jumping events. So Taiwo also plans to wear shoes made by Nike, Adidas and Asics. He must cover the logos of those competing brands, which he plans to do with tape, elastic sleeves and cleverly shaded fabric.\u201cIn terms of athletic performance, you have to have the right shoes to be able to meet your goals,\u201d Taiwo, 26, said in a telephone interview before traveling to Rio de Janeiro. \u201cAnd ultimately, you have to do well so you can get paid. If you make it, your shoes are largely responsible for that.\u201dThe camouflaging demonstrates the power of the $75 billion global athletic footwear industry, which closely monitors what athletes wear \u2014 and, with lawyers at its beck and call, what they do not.Although it is unclear how many athletes will be disguising their footwear at the Games, the practice is not uncommon at track meets, with the reasons for the cover-ups almost as varied as the shoes available.Athletes who have no shoe sponsor may not want to give free advertising to any company, preferring to signal that they are free agents. Taiwo called this an act of \u201cno representation without compensation.\u201dOther athletes disguise shoes because they are transitioning from one company to another and are continuing to wear their old shoes while new ones are being perfected. Some, like Taiwo, participate in events for which their sponsor does not make shoes. Some athletes are simply dissatisfied with the gear made by their sponsor.Sometimes, shoe companies give permission for athletes to wear another, disguised brand. Other times, they take umbrage, and the controversy becomes public.Nike did not say why the contract offer was rescinded, only that Walker \u201cdid not take up this option in a timely manner.\u201d Walker put his gear up for sale on eBay.Mike Hazle, the 2011 American champion in the javelin, said his Nike-made shoes were too narrow, causing his toenails to fall off and his feet to become numb. So for years, he said, he borrowed gear made by Asics and Li-Ning, a Chinese company, from a fellow javelin thrower. He covered those logos with tape or with slices from wristbands that bore the Nike swoosh.It was never a problem in the little-noticed event, Hazle said, until he won the United States title and a photograph of him appeared in Track & Field News. His left foot was raised after a throw, revealing the check-mark logo of Li-Ning on the bottom of his shoe.Nike was not pleased and exercised an option on his contract in 2012 to keep him from signing with another company, Hazle said, but offered only $10,000 with no chance of bonuses.It is unfortunate \u201cif someone is paying your bills and you\u2019re supposed to wear what they give you and it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Hazle said from Afghanistan, where he is serving in the Air National Guard. \u201cBut at the end of the day, it\u2019s going to compromise your performance, so you\u2019ve got to take care of yourself.\u201dNike said it did not comment on contracts but expected that its sponsored athletes \u201cwill always wear Nike products unless there is some specific, mutually agreed exception.\u201dOne high-profile exception took place last year. Christian Taylor of the United States, who won the triple jump at the 2012 Olympics and signed with Nike in 2015, was permitted to wear Adidas shoes at the world track and field championships in Beijing while Nike customized shoes for him. Taylor, the triple jump favorite at this year\u2019s Olympics, now wears Nikes.Two medal favorites in the high jump, Mutaz Essa Barshim of Qatar and Derek Drouin of Canada, have also been permitted by Nike to wear shoes from other brands that are covered by elastic sleeves resembling spats that bear the Nike swoosh.\u201cAs with any athlete, we are working closely with them to get the shoe that best suits their specific needs,\u201d Charlie Brooks, a Nike spokesman, said in an email. \u201cThere\u2019s no issue with our shoes; it\u2019s just a matter of personal customization for these athletes. We anticipate they\u2019ll be jumping in Nike shoes soon.\u201dCamouflaging reflects the particular nature of track and field, which finds itself in the limelight every four years during the Summer Games.Sprinters, pole-vaulters and steeplechasers generally do not receive annual salaries from teams the way professional football and basketball players do. Instead, they mostly rely on prize money and contracts with shoe companies, along with other endorsements.The apparel companies, Nike in particular, wield strong influence. They equip athletes and keep the struggling sport afloat. But they can also reduce payments when certain performance goals are not met. And at certain meets like the Olympics, athletes are restricted from wearing competing sponsor logos on their uniforms and as temporary tattoos.The number of track meets is dwindling, as are the available prize money and appearance fees, athletes and agents say. Rampant doping has threatened the legitimacy of the sport. Income disparity is wide.Carl Lewis, a nine-time Olympic gold medalist who has had a long affiliation with Nike, said the camouflaging of shoes was \u201ca microcosm of what the real issue is: Are we really creating a professional sport?\u201d\u201cWhy are we so dependent on just shoe companies?\u201d said Lewis, an assistant coach at the University of Houston.Some athletes said they considered it disrespectful and unprofessional to cover up the logo of a sponsor.\u201cIf they\u2019re paying money, the least we can do is respect their dollar,\u201d said Wallace Spearmon of the United States, a 200-meter sprinter and a former Nike athlete.Other athletes owe no allegiance because they have no shoe sponsor.Johnny Dutch of the United States has run the fastest time in the world this year in the 400-meter hurdles. But he said he had been without a shoe sponsor for three years, since his Nike contract ended. At the Olympic track and field trials in July in Eugene, Ore., Dutch wore shoes that were spray-painted neon orange to cover the logos of Nike and two other brands.This was done, in part, to express his artistic side, said Dutch, 27, an aspiring filmmaker. But it was also his way of saying that, for him to display any shoe company logo, \u201cthey\u2019ve got to support me,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to give me something where I can live and pay my medical bills.\u201dMoney had become so tight, Dutch said, that he had moved from Miami to live with his parents in Raleigh, N.C. His chance to gain visibility and financial buoyancy as an Olympian disappeared when Dutch clipped the final hurdle in the 400-meter hurdles at the trials and faded from first place to fifth.Only the top three advanced to Rio. Disconsolate, Dutch said he intended to retire.\u201cI feel like I can\u2019t do this no more,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI\u2019ve been struggling financially. I don\u2019t have a contract. I have no job.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber to Sell to Rival Didi Chuxing and Create New Business in China", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Uber\u2019s future in China seemed to hold promise.The sale, which would create a new company worth about $35 billion, would end the great ride-hailing battle of China. A person with knowledge of the deal said Uber investors had been pushing for such a transaction.The companies have been fighting relentlessly for market share in mainland China for two years, spending tens of millions of dollars every month to attract riders and drivers. The merger would end that competition and create significant scale, but it would also be a repudiation of Uber\u2019s ambitions to take on local Chinese competitors in their huge home market.Uber had pushed its way into a country that has gone almost untouched by major American tech companies in recent years. Its progress was widely watched and discussed by entrepreneurs and investors alike as a model for how to reach China\u2019s 600 million internet users \u2014 a forbidding prospect considering the country\u2019s well-funded local competitors and regulations aimed at blocking foreign businesses.With the deal, the company will join the ranks of American peers like Google and eBay, which were unable to capitalize on early footholds in China. EBay was outmaneuvered by Alibaba, while Google left China after it said it was the target of government-sponsored cyberattacks.Still, it is by no means a financial catastrophe for Uber, which for about $2 billion of investment in the Chinese market gets a $7 billion share in a company that is likely to grow. It also saves the cash it may have spent competing in China for other projects.\u201cHowever, as an entrepreneur, I\u2019ve learned that being successful is about listening to your head as well as following your heart,\u201d he wrote. \u201cUber and Didi Chuxing are investing billions of dollars in China and both companies have yet to turn a profit there.\u201dUnder the terms of the deal, the new company\u2019s estimated worth is a combination of Didi Chuxing\u2019s $28 billion valuation and Uber China\u2019s $7 billion, according to two people with knowledge of the deal, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the information had not yet been made public. Uber shareholders would receive a 20 percent stake in the new company.Over the past two years, Uber upended expectations in China and its business there grew, despite heavy regulation and internet filters that often limit access to the products of foreign tech companies. The early 2015 rollout of People\u2019s Uber, a service that got ordinary Chinese drivers behind the wheel and taking passengers, helped Uber grab a chunk of market share from Didi.As it grew in China, Uber avoided many of the mistakes made by of its American tech forebears. For one, the company created local teams based around different cities, allowing it to respond quickly and flexibly to moves by the competition. That set it apart from other companies, which sought to control Chinese operations from the United States, slowing their responses.But entry is just the first obstacle to the Chinese internet market. Competition is fierce, and the focus is less on the product than on big spending to lure customers or on tricks to harm competitors. Fraudsters and opportunists also abound.Uber\u2019s engineers, operating from San Francisco, had to deal with drivers who simulated or faked rides to get commissions. At the same time, the company was blocked from marketing on China\u2019s biggest social network, WeChat, because the internet giant Tencent was an early investor in Didi. All of that made it much harder to compete with a company that already had an advantage in scale, not to mention the backing of Tencent, Alibaba and Apple. When it raised $7 billion in June, Didi made it clear it was willing to continue the fight for a long time.For all the publicity around the spat between Uber and Didi, the two had been in talks stretching back to the Didi-Kuaidi merger in the beginning of 2015, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. That person said the two sides could not overcome disagreements about valuations at the time.In another quirk to the latest deal, two members of the same well-known family in the world of technology were on opposite sides of the negotiating table: Didi\u2019s president, Jean Liu, is the daughter of Liu Chuanzhi, the Chinese founder of the largest computer maker in the world, Lenovo. Her cousin, Zhen Liu, is a vice president and regular spokeswoman for Uber China.Although the tie-up is expected to reassure investors, Chinese analysts said it would probably lead to a decrease in commissions. That could hurt customers and drivers alike, the analysts said, making it harder for smaller players to compete because their larger rival would no longer be saddled with such an expense.\u201cFor smaller companies like Yidao or Shenzhou, if they keep subsidizing users, it will only be temporary and will bring more financial burdens,\u201d said Hong Bo, an independent technology analyst in China.Li Bo, a 22-year-old driver from Henan, said the loyalty of drivers is determined by where they could get the best pay. That meant they would continue to follow the subsidies, he said.\u201cAll we care is who gives us the best deal,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Didi buys Uber, we just work for Didi. It doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201dPaul Mozur reported from Hong Kong, and Mike Isaac from San Francisco. Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting from New York.

That\u2019s one of several things that often makes China\u2019s market unique in the world, along with a strong nationalist streak, local innovation and good old-fashioned protectionism.Whichever of these you consider paramount, they create a strangely familiar outcome in Uber\u2019s decision to sell its China operations to Didi Chuxing, the local version of Uber\u2019s ride-hailing service.In the business of technology infrastructure, China has also been a tough market. Cisco Systems manages to sell some products, but it has lost much business to Huawei, a Chinese maker of internet gear. Cisco once sued Huawei, accusing it of copying Cisco\u2019s stuff, but it now says relations are fine. They are, except Huawei executives privately fume at the difficulties they have entering the American market.The way Cisco and Huawei dominate their home markets and the way local Chinese cloud companies are likely to have a big role in China but little elsewhere for now suggest a likely fate for Didi-Uber: The Chinese company gets its big market, and the Americans get theirs, and much of the world besides. Don\u2019t expect to see a big push by Didi in, say, Europe, where Uber already has operations.For now. After all, China is a huge market.

Facebook was a college social site before it became a global media hub; Amazon was a bookseller before it was, well, everything.Joe MacMillan (Lee Pace), a mysterious, smooth-talking drifter of a businessman, was paired with Gordon Clark (Scoot McNairy), a brilliant but failed engineer, in a sketchy scheme to bring an IBM clone to market. As a plot, it was less than inspiring, and as a character story, less than inspired: an 8-bit Don Draper and a Walter White who dealt in megabytes rather than meth.But at the end of its first season, \u201cHalt\u201d did something almost unheard-of in television, if not in tech: It upended its entire project. With the introduction of the Apple Macintosh, Joe and Gordon discovered that they had been chasing yesterday\u2019s dream. They were thinking too small, too incrementally. The quest of the entire season had been a failure of imagination.The headlines then were about computing power coming to your desktop. But the long-term change, barely glimmering in the days of telephone modems, lay in the connection of every desktop to every other. It was the birth of the social internet, where we now live.Season 2 followed Mutiny, a nascent online gaming company started by Gordon\u2019s wife, Donna (Kerry Bish\u00e9), and Cameron Howe (Mackenzie Davis), an impassioned sparkplug of a programmer.For all practical purposes, the series changed not just its focus but its lead characters. Cameron was visionary but impractical; Donna relished the new start but chafed at being forced into the role of the buzz kill adult in the room. (Ms. Bish\u00e9 gave a nuanced, undersung performance.)This was something we hadn\u2019t seen so often before: a tricky but fruitful alliance between two women in a male-dominated industry. Cameron had the digital native\u2019s instinct to see the online world as a place of constant invention. Donna had the emotional intelligence to notice that Mutiny\u2019s social component \u2014 its chat rooms \u2014 was the future of the future.Season 3, which begins on Tuesday, continues the show\u2019s iterative-learning process, picking up in 1986, as Mutiny has relocated from Texas to Silicon Valley and is beginning to reconceive itself one more time. (Cameron and Donna have noticed their gamers\u2019 taking over Mutiny chat to negotiate real-world trades \u2014 shades of Craigslist or eBay.)The growing pains continue, throwing the women into the unfamiliar and testosterone-heavy world of venture capitalists. \u201cIt only takes one of them to ask you to the dance,\u201d says their consigliere, John Bosworth (Toby Huss). Cameron replies, \u201cI love how even the metaphors in this business are sexist.\u201d They find a possible ally in Diane (Annabeth Gish), a sympathetic but bluntly honest investor.Gordon has come along in tow, feeling at loose ends in a managerial role at Mutiny. The chameleonic Joe, meanwhile, has landed in California as the head of a software-security firm, sporting a Steve Jobsian beard and speaking in pretentious koans. (\u201cI\u2019ve been accused of selling fear,\u201d he tells a rapt audience. \u201cBut let me ask you: Is it fear or is it truth?\u201d)Joe\u2019s re-reinvention as a smug tech guru suits Mr. Pace, a striking but peculiar presence whom the show has struggled to use effectively. (He was well cast in the \u201cHobbit\u201d movies as the frosty, Eurotrash-y elven king Thranduil.) He seems fully at home now, strutting around his office listening to Gary Numan music, carrying himself like a human Patrick Nagel print.The new season takes time to reset, and the movement in the early episodes is slow. The character dynamics are solid, though, and the \u201980s details continue to be spot on. (At a fancy Valley restaurant, Donna stumbles over the pronunciation of a trendy new dish: risotto.)But any well-produced period piece can recreate bygone days. \u201cHalt\u201d lets you see them as the cusp of bracing change.

{"Headline": "Olympic Cover-Up: Why You Won\u2019t See Some Shoe Logos", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The track and field events at the Rio Olympics this month will showcase elite athletic talent and, if you look closely, creative subterfuge.Tape, markers, elastic sleeves and maybe even paint will disguise some shoe brand logos in an Olympic sleight of foot.In track and field, the centerpiece sport of the Summer Games, shoes are the most vital piece of equipment and serve purposes beyond performance: supplying advertising billboards for apparel companies and providing financial footing for athletes. But some athletes do not want the world to see the logos on their shoes, or they are prohibited from doing so by their sponsors if they wear competing brands.Although United States track and field athletes at the Rio Games must wear uniforms bearing the familiar swoosh of Nike, an official team sponsor, they are free to wear their own brand of shoes, disguised or not.Take, for example, Jeremy Taiwo, a decathlete from Seattle who will wear eight pairs of shoes in his 10 events, each with a function as specific as a golf club\u2019s.His shoe sponsor is Brooks, but the company does not make shoes designed for throwing and jumping events. So Taiwo also plans to wear shoes made by Nike, Adidas and Asics. He must cover the logos of those competing brands, which he plans to do with tape, elastic sleeves and cleverly shaded fabric.\u201cIn terms of athletic performance, you have to have the right shoes to be able to meet your goals,\u201d Taiwo, 26, said in a telephone interview before traveling to Rio de Janeiro. \u201cAnd ultimately, you have to do well so you can get paid. If you make it, your shoes are largely responsible for that.\u201dThe camouflaging demonstrates the power of the $75 billion global athletic footwear industry, which closely monitors what athletes wear \u2014 and, with lawyers at its beck and call, what they do not.Although it is unclear how many athletes will be disguising their footwear at the Games, the practice is not uncommon at track meets, with the reasons for the cover-ups almost as varied as the shoes available.Athletes who have no shoe sponsor may not want to give free advertising to any company, preferring to signal that they are free agents. Taiwo called this an act of \u201cno representation without compensation.\u201dOther athletes disguise shoes because they are transitioning from one company to another and are continuing to wear their old shoes while new ones are being perfected. Some, like Taiwo, participate in events for which their sponsor does not make shoes. Some athletes are simply dissatisfied with the gear made by their sponsor.Sometimes, shoe companies give permission for athletes to wear another, disguised brand. Other times, they take umbrage, and the controversy becomes public.Nike did not say why the contract offer was rescinded, only that Walker \u201cdid not take up this option in a timely manner.\u201d Walker put his gear up for sale on eBay.Mike Hazle, the 2011 American champion in the javelin, said his Nike-made shoes were too narrow, causing his toenails to fall off and his feet to become numb. So for years, he said, he borrowed gear made by Asics and Li-Ning, a Chinese company, from a fellow javelin thrower. He covered those logos with tape or with slices from wristbands that bore the Nike swoosh.It was never a problem in the little-noticed event, Hazle said, until he won the United States title and a photograph of him appeared in Track & Field News. His left foot was raised after a throw, revealing the check-mark logo of Li-Ning on the bottom of his shoe.Nike was not pleased and exercised an option on his contract in 2012 to keep him from signing with another company, Hazle said, but offered only $10,000 with no chance of bonuses.It is unfortunate \u201cif someone is paying your bills and you\u2019re supposed to wear what they give you and it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Hazle said from Afghanistan, where he is serving in the Air National Guard. \u201cBut at the end of the day, it\u2019s going to compromise your performance, so you\u2019ve got to take care of yourself.\u201dNike said it did not comment on contracts but expected that its sponsored athletes \u201cwill always wear Nike products unless there is some specific, mutually agreed exception.\u201dOne high-profile exception took place last year. Christian Taylor of the United States, who won the triple jump at the 2012 Olympics and signed with Nike in 2015, was permitted to wear Adidas shoes at the world track and field championships in Beijing while Nike customized shoes for him. Taylor, the triple jump favorite at this year\u2019s Olympics, now wears Nikes.Two medal favorites in the high jump, Mutaz Essa Barshim of Qatar and Derek Drouin of Canada, have also been permitted by Nike to wear shoes from other brands that are covered by elastic sleeves resembling spats that bear the Nike swoosh.\u201cAs with any athlete, we are working closely with them to get the shoe that best suits their specific needs,\u201d Charlie Brooks, a Nike spokesman, said in an email. \u201cThere\u2019s no issue with our shoes; it\u2019s just a matter of personal customization for these athletes. We anticipate they\u2019ll be jumping in Nike shoes soon.\u201dCamouflaging reflects the particular nature of track and field, which finds itself in the limelight every four years during the Summer Games.Sprinters, pole-vaulters and steeplechasers generally do not receive annual salaries from teams the way professional football and basketball players do. Instead, they mostly rely on prize money and contracts with shoe companies, along with other endorsements.The apparel companies, Nike in particular, wield strong influence. They equip athletes and keep the struggling sport afloat. But they can also reduce payments when certain performance goals are not met. And at certain meets like the Olympics, athletes are restricted from wearing competing sponsor logos on their uniforms and as temporary tattoos.The number of track meets is dwindling, as are the available prize money and appearance fees, athletes and agents say. Rampant doping has threatened the legitimacy of the sport. Income disparity is wide.Carl Lewis, a nine-time Olympic gold medalist who has had a long affiliation with Nike, said the camouflaging of shoes was \u201ca microcosm of what the real issue is: Are we really creating a professional sport?\u201d\u201cWhy are we so dependent on just shoe companies?\u201d said Lewis, an assistant coach at the University of Houston.Some athletes said they considered it disrespectful and unprofessional to cover up the logo of a sponsor.\u201cIf they\u2019re paying money, the least we can do is respect their dollar,\u201d said Wallace Spearmon of the United States, a 200-meter sprinter and a former Nike athlete.Other athletes owe no allegiance because they have no shoe sponsor.Johnny Dutch of the United States has run the fastest time in the world this year in the 400-meter hurdles. But he said he had been without a shoe sponsor for three years, since his Nike contract ended. At the Olympic track and field trials in July in Eugene, Ore., Dutch wore shoes that were spray-painted neon orange to cover the logos of Nike and two other brands.This was done, in part, to express his artistic side, said Dutch, 27, an aspiring filmmaker. But it was also his way of saying that, for him to display any shoe company logo, \u201cthey\u2019ve got to support me,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to give me something where I can live and pay my medical bills.\u201dMoney had become so tight, Dutch said, that he had moved from Miami to live with his parents in Raleigh, N.C. His chance to gain visibility and financial buoyancy as an Olympian disappeared when Dutch clipped the final hurdle in the 400-meter hurdles at the trials and faded from first place to fifth.Only the top three advanced to Rio. Disconsolate, Dutch said he intended to retire.\u201cI feel like I can\u2019t do this no more,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI\u2019ve been struggling financially. I don\u2019t have a contract. I have no job.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine Show New Tax Returns, Pressuring Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "Supported byHillary Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, released a new batch of their own income tax returns on Friday, ratcheting up the pressure on her opponent, Donald J. Trump, to begin making public his own forms.They paid about $3.6 million in federal taxes for an effective tax rate of about 35 percent.More than half their income came from speeches; Mrs. Clinton also earned $3 million from \u201cHard Choices,\u201d her memoir of her years as secretary of state.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s spokeswoman, Jennifer Palmieri, said in a statement the release sets a \u201cstark contrast\u201d with Mr. Trump, whom she accused of \u201chiding behind fake excuses.\u201dThe income taxes of Mrs. Clinton, along with her husband, former President Bill Clinton, showed an adjusted gross income of $10.6 million for 2015, which were released Friday.\u201cHe has failed to provide the public with the most basic financial information disclosed by every major candidate in the last 40 years,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is he trying to hide?\u201dThe Trump campaign would not discuss his tax returns, but in a statement on Friday, a spokesman, Jason Miller, called Mrs. Clinton\u2019s disclosure an effort to shield her from questions about her emails when she was secretary of state and about what favors were sought by donors to her family\u2019s foundation.\u201cThis document release is nothing more than an attempt at distraction and misdirection by an individual who created and then purged an illegal private email server,\u201d he said.While Mr. Trump has cited an I.R.S. audit as his reason for not releasing his taxes, the agency said in a statement this year, \u201cNothing prevents individuals from sharing their own tax information.\u201dThe lack of a disclosure of his taxes has opened Mr. Trump to attacks, first during the Republican primary campaign and now in the months leading to the Nov. 8 general election.Mr. Kaine, the Virginia senator and Hillary Clinton's running mate, and his wife, Anne Holton, reported income of $313,441 for 2015, which was released Friday.Given the expansive web of tax breaks available to real estate developers, tax experts say it would not be surprising if Mr. Trump paid little or no income taxes some years, even as he amassed billions of dollars in wealth.The Clintons\u2019 income has also brought scrutiny, and their returns hint at how much they have relied on their star power and government connections to catapult them into the ranks of the super rich. Though they were once seen as relatable to average Americans, polls suggest that many voters now see them as out of touch.Their 2015 income, while less than half what they earned the previous year, put them well above the $2 million threshold for the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers, according to an analysis of federal income tax data by Emmanuel Saez, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley. They were within $1 million of reaching the 0.01 percent threshold \u2014 or the top 1 percent of the top 1 percent.In recent years they have collected tens of millions of dollars in fees for speeches, including some delivered abroad and others sponsored by financial institutions.Almost all presidential nominees since 1976 have made their tax returns public, most around Tax Day in April  \u2014 about 200 days before the election.In 2015, before she officially began her campaign and stopped giving speeches, she earned $1.5 million in speaking fees. Her husband earned $5.25 million from speeches last year.According to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s personal financial disclosure filed in May, she and her husband made more than two dozen speeches in 2015 for $150,000 and up. Mr. Clinton earned $225,000 for a February speech sponsored by UBS Wealth Management, for example, and Mrs. Clinton gave a speech for eBay in March for $315,000. Mr. Clinton also earned $1.7 million from his consulting business, WJC L.L.C., after it brought in more than $6 million the year before, according to the tax returns.These financial ties \u2014 including the past speeches, business endeavors and well as donor relationships with the Clinton Foundation \u2014 have already attracted critics who say they include inherent conflicts of interest and could be problematic under a Clinton administration.From 2007 to 2015, according to returns released Friday and previously, the Clintons made a total adjusted gross income of $150 million and paid $48 million in federal taxes. In the same period they gave $16 million to charity, including $1 million last year that went mostly to their family foundation.The Clintons\u2019 other income last year included $24,932 in interest, $84,358 in mutual fund dividends and $226,297 in pension payments from the federal and Arkansas governments.Their deductions included $1.4 million in state income taxes and $98,244 in property taxes on their homes in Chappaqua, N.Y., and Washington. They also wrote off $41,040 in mortgage interest.David Barstow contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Even Uber Couldn\u2019t Bridge the China Divide", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtTravis Kalanick, the co-founder and chief executive of the ride-hailing giant Uber, often defended his eagerness to risk billions on winning the Chinese market with a simple question: If you have a chance to become Amazon and Alibaba at the same time, why not try?The implication was simple. Over the last couple of decades, Amazon, Facebook, Google and other American technology giants have each followed a similar script for world domination. Like an imperial armada rolling out from North America\u2019s West Coast, these companies would try to establish beachheads on every other continent.But when American giants tried to enter the waters of China, the world\u2019s largest internet market, the armada invariably ran aground.Plagued by opaque and ever-shifting regulations and a culturally abstruse way of doing business, American companies fell to a series of local giants. Instead of Google, Baidu. Instead of Facebook, WeChat, owned by the giant Tencent. And instead of Amazon, Alibaba.That has left us with a divide: Today, there is the Chinese internet, and there is the internet of the rest of the world. A network seen in its early days as a tool to foster financial and political unity across a fragmented planet has irrevocably cleaved into two completely separate spheres.Entrepreneurs across the globe can choose to win in China or the rest of the world. You can be Alibaba or you can be Amazon. You can be Uber or you can be Didi. But you can\u2019t be both. Given the rising Chinese market and increasing tension over the role of American tech firms in the rest of the globe, the gulf between the two sides promises to become one of the most important factors in determining the shape of global tech innovation.How exactly might the war play out? In some ways, being at the mercy of two poles of internet leadership could be good for citizens of planet Earth. In emerging markets like India, the Middle East and parts of Africa and South America, the giants of China and the United States are increasingly investing billions to compete for local customers in e-commerce, social networking, ride sharing and other markets.\u201cAmazon is increasingly making its own branded products, taking on Procter & Gamble and others, and also getting into the logistics business, and shipping, and everything else,\u201d Mr. Clark said. \u201cBut Alibaba is a marketplace that doesn\u2019t hold inventory and describes themselves as helping local merchants \u2014 so maybe there\u2019s some argument that Alibaba could serve as a counter globally to Amazon.\u201d\u201cIn that way it could be like the Yalta Conference,\u201d said Mr. Clark, referring to the 1945 meeting in which the victors of World War II determined the postwar geopolitical order.\u201cThe barrels that will be thrown at you when you\u2019re trying to do business in China will just never stop,\u201d said Mark Natkin, the managing director of Marbridge Consulting, an advisory firm based in Beijing. \u201cYou\u2019ll constantly be above one barrel or recovering from jumping one, and as you\u2019re dusting yourself off you look down the road and here comes the next one.\u201dCompared with previous failures, Uber seemed to do everything right in China. It set up a separate company, Uber China, which had a buy-in from local investors, including from a local giant, Baidu. It hired many local experts, and worked closely with the national government to foster friendly relations.Insiders say Mr. Kalanick was also personally invested in the deal. He visited China eight times in the last year and a half, and became something of a tech star in the Chinese media.Publicly Mr. Kalanick had insisted he was fighting for total victory in China. But he must have known that Uber would always struggle to achieve dominance, given the emerging centrality of ride-sharing to the future of infrastructure in China. Still, even if he failed to win everything in China, investing early in the country seemed too big to skip.For now, it\u2019s especially delicious frosting. The $2 billion Uber spent tackling China is now worth about $7 billion in the new merged entity; if Didi does become one of China\u2019s largest tech companies, the value of Uber\u2019s stake in China could rise geometrically, making the firm much more attractive in a potential initial public offering. Pulling out of China also frees up Uber to invest more in other markets \u2014 India and Indonesia are big targets \u2014 as well as expand its expertise in core technological initiatives like mapping data and self-driving cars.But if spending big to tackle China ultimately works out for Uber, it will be an anomaly, and certainly not a model for other American tech giants.\u201cThe ride-sharing market is one the few markets where the upside is big enough to justify going in,\u201d Mr. Thompson said. \u201cFor most other companies, going into China is still going to be nothing but pain.\u201dEmail: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tuesdays with Reince, Episode 2: The San Francisco Affair", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNotebook\u201cYes!\u201d our hero said, as boyishly excited as ever.\u201cI texted my wife about what a scoundrel he is,\u201d Priebus told me. But who was he to judge? I asked Priebus if he could assure Republicans that he, their esteemed leader, had himself never sent pictures of his G.O.P. genitalia to strangers. He chuckled.\u201cI am a Boy Scout,\u201d he promised.But was he really?Actually a Cub Scout, Reince said, quickly moving to clarify his record. I asked him if he had seen what Trump had tweeted about Huma and Anthony Monday afternoon while he was in the air. \u201cNo, what\u2019d he say?\u201d Priebus said with a barely detectable flash of terror in his voice. (What room did the Rottweiler trash now?) I told him that Trump praised Abedin for \u201ca very wise decision\u201d and that he then went on to accuse Hillary Clinton of being \u201ccareless and negligent in allowing Weiner to have such close proximity to highly classified information.\u201d (There is zero proof that Clinton did such a thing). \u201cIt is possible that our country and its security have been greatly compromised by this,\u201d Trump persisted, though it\u2019s unclear exactly how Weiner\u2019s handiwork compromised anything more than what was left of Weiner\u2019s dignity.\u201cIs this the kind of thing your nominee should be weighing in on?\u201d I asked Priebus.\u201cWell, look, I don\u2019t really get involved with this,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cI just landed. But clearly the guy is a scoundrel and has problems.\u201dWho, Weiner or Trump?\u201cAnthony.\u201dOne bit of housecleaning from the Republican primaries: I asked Priebus about the pledges that the R.N.C. asked its presidential candidates to sign last year promising they would support the party\u2019s eventual nominee. What became of those? (Are they on eBay?) They remain a bit of a sore spot with Priebus, given that the last two Republican candidates to bow out of the primaries, Ted Cruz and John Kasich, are still not supporting Trump and seem in no hurry to pledge allegiance. Priebus pointed out that in exchange for signing the pledge and promising their support for the Republican standard-bearer, the candidates received voter data from the R.N.C. \u201cI think they should honor their word,\u201d Priebus said. Could Cruz and Kasich face sanction from the party if they seek the nomination again? \u201cIf they want to run one day, the issue of not supporting the party\u2019s nominee is going to be an issue for them,\u201d he said. But that will be a moot point in 2020, he added, \u201cbecause we will have an incumbent president in the White House.\u201dIn which case, I asked, where Priebus would be? Did he want to be an ambassador to somewhere?\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cWisconsin.\u201dBefore we finished, I asked Priebus to leave us with another trademark bit of his homespun Wisconsin wisdom. Last week he shared a cryptic-yet-profound warning against lighting fireworks on a patio (\u201cThey leave black marks\u201d). This time, Priebus had no guidance at the ready for us. \u201cYou gotta tell me these things before we have these discussions,\u201d Priebus protested. It seemed wrong to remind Reince that a real Boy Scout should be ready for anything.Mark Leibovich is the chief national correspondent for the magazine.Advertisement"}
