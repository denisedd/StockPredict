{"Headline": "China, Eager to Host Elite Club, Primps for G-20 Meeting", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "Supported byHANGZHOU, China \u2014 As China prepares to host the Group of 20 economic summit meeting this weekend in Hangzhou, it is determined to show the world that it is an equal partner in one of the most exclusive clubs of wealthy nations.The conference, in this striking lakeside city south of Shanghai, will be the most significant gathering of world leaders in China\u2019s history, and President Xi Jinping has ordered stringent security to ensure it goes off without a hitch.The government is using all the levers of its authoritarian system, forcing residents to move out of buildings near the meeting site to diminish the risk of protests or attacks and telling workers to take vacations to help clear the city and present a sanitized version of one of China\u2019s most vibrant economic hubs.It has gone so far as to banish cooks who are Uighurs, a Muslim minority that has been accused of fomenting terrorism, from working at one restaurant in the city.The rotating presidency, now held by China, is the culmination of a long battle for acceptance at the top of the international system. Though China is a member of the United Nations Security Council, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade Organization, the country\u2019s leadership feels as if it has been treated too much like a Johnny-come-lately at global summit meetings.The Group of 20 appeals to China as a place to stake its influence because its members include some developing countries that Beijing enlists as friends, yet as a whole the group represents more than 80 percent of the world economy and a big portion of world trade.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.\u201cThere will not be any policy miracles coming out of the summit,\u201d said Tristram Sainsbury, project director of G-20 studies at the Lowy Institute for International Policy in Australia.The party\u2019s resilience under Mr. Xi \u2014 on display with giant flags showing the hammer and sickle at security checkpoints \u2014 is part of the meeting\u2019s message.One of Mr. Xi\u2019s provincial successors, the party chief, Xia Baolong, said the meeting would \u201cdemonstrate the great achievement of China\u2019s opening and reform, and the immense superiority of socialism with Chinese characteristics,\u201d the government\u2019s description of its political and economic system.In Hangzhou, thousands have been forced to move from luxury high-rise buildings near the conference center, their apartments sealed with tape to prevent a sniper from venturing inside. Government and private sector workers have been granted vacations, and migrant workers have been told to return to their home provinces. In an effort to guarantee blue skies, factories within a wide perimeter around the city have been closed.Yet some of the security measures here seem picayune. Two weeks before the meeting, the kitchen division of the Metro Center department store was devoid of knives. They had been banned for sale since June, a saleswoman said. At a Starbucks in the center of the city, the food counter was empty. Delivery trucks had been unable to crack the security cordon, the barista said.A major focus of security has been the Uighurs. At the Beijiang restaurant, with wall murals of China\u2019s western deserts and a halal menu, 10 Uighur cooks were sent home in June at the request of the government, said the manager, Cai Ziwei.Only afterward was the establishment placed on a list of restaurants recommended for Muslim delegates to the meeting, he said.Hotels were told two months ago that they must inform the police if a Uighur tried to register, a worker at the Hanting hotel chain said.In June, police officers in the migrant neighborhood of Qibao, 15 miles from the city center, ordered all the grocery shops, clothing outlets and street-side restaurants closed, said Wang Jinfu, a municipal government worker.In some instances, small businesses were asked to close on the grounds that if they stayed open and an accident occurred, local party officials would be penalized.\u201cThey told us, this is a once-in-a-lifetime thing, and if anything happens while Obama is here, the officials could be sacked, so they said, \u2018Please close,\u2019 \u201d said Li Yindeng, the owner of Chenyang, a noodle shop. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do, and the government doesn\u2019t pay compensation.\u201dOne party official was detained for 10 days in July for complaining online about the high costs of the preparations. The state-run Global Times reported that the official, Guo Enping, was held because his article, \u201cHangzhou, Shame on You,\u201d drew such wide readership.As the rules began to disrupt daily life, more people vented online, and calls to the city\u2019s hotline mounted. \u201cEvery day our media attacks the vicious foreign powers, and now they come, we have to kneel and serve,\u201d one person wrote.For a public that regularly faces problems of contaminated food, there was dismay when the leader of the state authority for grain, Ren Zhengxiao, said he would not allow \u201cone single grain of unsafe rice or one drop of unsafe oil\u201d to enter the kitchens preparing the leaders\u2019 banquet meal.The government urged everyone to get with program.\u201cPeople must not express their discontent with unreasonable actions or even deny the importance of the security work of the G-20 summit,\u201d the state-run Zhejiang Daily wrote.Advertisement"}

The all-cash deal, which is expected to close by the end of the year, does not include Caesars Interactive\u2019s World Series of Poker game or its other real-money game businesses.In recent years, the Montreal-based Caesars Interactive has built Playtika, which it acquired in 2011, into a major player in the world of smartphone-based casino-style games. While many of Playtika\u2019s games, like Slotomania and Bingo Blitz, are free to play, users can also pay for virtual currency and items to enhance play. The virtual currency used in Playtika games will continue to be not exchangeable for real money, according to the statement.While it is not clear when or whether Chinese regulators will accept gambling-style games, the Chinese investment is an example of how internet companies in China often invest first and then worry about legal restrictions. It is also a sign that investors are willing to pay increasingly large sums for smartphone games, which have proved to be one of the best ways to make money from users.While social networking apps may be more popular, mobile games like Clash of Clans and Candy Crush are some of the most profitable apps around. In China, where playing games on a smartphone can often stand in for other entertainment, like going to a movie, technology companies have competed intensely to lure players and the spare change those players are willing to spend on games.For Shanghai Giant Network Technology, acquiring Playtika will also extend its reach beyond China. Other Chinese tech companies have used deals to reach players around the world. Among them is Tencent, which has gained control over internationally well-known games like League of Legends.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Even Uber Couldn\u2019t Bridge the China Divide", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtTravis Kalanick, the co-founder and chief executive of the ride-hailing giant Uber, often defended his eagerness to risk billions on winning the Chinese market with a simple question: If you have a chance to become Amazon and Alibaba at the same time, why not try?The implication was simple. Over the last couple of decades, Amazon, Facebook, Google and other American technology giants have each followed a similar script for world domination. Like an imperial armada rolling out from North America\u2019s West Coast, these companies would try to establish beachheads on every other continent.But when American giants tried to enter the waters of China, the world\u2019s largest internet market, the armada invariably ran aground.Plagued by opaque and ever-shifting regulations and a culturally abstruse way of doing business, American companies fell to a series of local giants. Instead of Google, Baidu. Instead of Facebook, WeChat, owned by the giant Tencent. And instead of Amazon, Alibaba.That has left us with a divide: Today, there is the Chinese internet, and there is the internet of the rest of the world. A network seen in its early days as a tool to foster financial and political unity across a fragmented planet has irrevocably cleaved into two completely separate spheres.Entrepreneurs across the globe can choose to win in China or the rest of the world. You can be Alibaba or you can be Amazon. You can be Uber or you can be Didi. But you can\u2019t be both. Given the rising Chinese market and increasing tension over the role of American tech firms in the rest of the globe, the gulf between the two sides promises to become one of the most important factors in determining the shape of global tech innovation.How exactly might the war play out? In some ways, being at the mercy of two poles of internet leadership could be good for citizens of planet Earth. In emerging markets like India, the Middle East and parts of Africa and South America, the giants of China and the United States are increasingly investing billions to compete for local customers in e-commerce, social networking, ride sharing and other markets.\u201cAmazon is increasingly making its own branded products, taking on Procter & Gamble and others, and also getting into the logistics business, and shipping, and everything else,\u201d Mr. Clark said. \u201cBut Alibaba is a marketplace that doesn\u2019t hold inventory and describes themselves as helping local merchants \u2014 so maybe there\u2019s some argument that Alibaba could serve as a counter globally to Amazon.\u201d\u201cIn that way it could be like the Yalta Conference,\u201d said Mr. Clark, referring to the 1945 meeting in which the victors of World War II determined the postwar geopolitical order.\u201cThe barrels that will be thrown at you when you\u2019re trying to do business in China will just never stop,\u201d said Mark Natkin, the managing director of Marbridge Consulting, an advisory firm based in Beijing. \u201cYou\u2019ll constantly be above one barrel or recovering from jumping one, and as you\u2019re dusting yourself off you look down the road and here comes the next one.\u201dCompared with previous failures, Uber seemed to do everything right in China. It set up a separate company, Uber China, which had a buy-in from local investors, including from a local giant, Baidu. It hired many local experts, and worked closely with the national government to foster friendly relations.Insiders say Mr. Kalanick was also personally invested in the deal. He visited China eight times in the last year and a half, and became something of a tech star in the Chinese media.Publicly Mr. Kalanick had insisted he was fighting for total victory in China. But he must have known that Uber would always struggle to achieve dominance, given the emerging centrality of ride-sharing to the future of infrastructure in China. Still, even if he failed to win everything in China, investing early in the country seemed too big to skip.For now, it\u2019s especially delicious frosting.

{"Headline": "Uber to Sell to Rival Didi Chuxing and Create New Business in China", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Uber\u2019s future in China seemed to hold promise.The sale, which would create a new company worth about $35 billion, would end the great ride-hailing battle of China. A person with knowledge of the deal said Uber investors had been pushing for such a transaction.The companies have been fighting relentlessly for market share in mainland China for two years, spending tens of millions of dollars every month to attract riders and drivers. The merger would end that competition and create significant scale, but it would also be a repudiation of Uber\u2019s ambitions to take on local Chinese competitors in their huge home market.Uber had pushed its way into a country that has gone almost untouched by major American tech companies in recent years. Its progress was widely watched and discussed by entrepreneurs and investors alike as a model for how to reach China\u2019s 600 million internet users \u2014 a forbidding prospect considering the country\u2019s well-funded local competitors and regulations aimed at blocking foreign businesses.With the deal, the company will join the ranks of American peers like Google and eBay, which were unable to capitalize on early footholds in China. EBay was outmaneuvered by Alibaba, while Google left China after it said it was the target of government-sponsored cyberattacks.Still, it is by no means a financial catastrophe for Uber, which for about $2 billion of investment in the Chinese market gets a $7 billion share in a company that is likely to grow. It also saves the cash it may have spent competing in China for other projects.\u201cHowever, as an entrepreneur, I\u2019ve learned that being successful is about listening to your head as well as following your heart,\u201d he wrote. \u201cUber and Didi Chuxing are investing billions of dollars in China and both companies have yet to turn a profit there.\u201dUnder the terms of the deal, the new company\u2019s estimated worth is a combination of Didi Chuxing\u2019s $28 billion valuation and Uber China\u2019s $7 billion, according to two people with knowledge of the deal, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the information had not yet been made public. Uber shareholders would receive a 20 percent stake in the new company.Over the past two years, Uber upended expectations in China and its business there grew, despite heavy regulation and internet filters that often limit access to the products of foreign tech companies. The early 2015 rollout of People\u2019s Uber, a service that got ordinary Chinese drivers behind the wheel and taking passengers, helped Uber grab a chunk of market share from Didi.As it grew in China, Uber avoided many of the mistakes made by of its American tech forebears. For one, the company created local teams based around different cities, allowing it to respond quickly and flexibly to moves by the competition. That set it apart from other companies, which sought to control Chinese operations from the United States, slowing their responses.But entry is just the first obstacle to the Chinese internet market. Competition is fierce, and the focus is less on the product than on big spending to lure customers or on tricks to harm competitors. Fraudsters and opportunists also abound.Uber\u2019s engineers, operating from San Francisco, had to deal with drivers who simulated or faked rides to get commissions. At the same time, the company was blocked from marketing on China\u2019s biggest social network, WeChat, because the internet giant Tencent was an early investor in Didi. All of that made it much harder to compete with a company that already had an advantage in scale, not to mention the backing of Tencent, Alibaba and Apple. When it raised $7 billion in June, Didi made it clear it was willing to continue the fight for a long time.For all the publicity around the spat between Uber and Didi, the two had been in talks stretching back to the Didi-Kuaidi merger in the beginning of 2015, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. That person said the two sides could not overcome disagreements about valuations at the time.In another quirk to the latest deal, two members of the same well-known family in the world of technology were on opposite sides of the negotiating table: Didi\u2019s president, Jean Liu, is the daughter of Liu Chuanzhi, the Chinese founder of the largest computer maker in the world, Lenovo. Her cousin, Zhen Liu, is a vice president and regular spokeswoman for Uber China.Although the tie-up is expected to reassure investors, Chinese analysts said it would probably lead to a decrease in commissions. That could hurt customers and drivers alike, the analysts said, making it harder for smaller players to compete because their larger rival would no longer be saddled with such an expense.\u201cFor smaller companies like Yidao or Shenzhou, if they keep subsidizing users, it will only be temporary and will bring more financial burdens,\u201d said Hong Bo, an independent technology analyst in China.Li Bo, a 22-year-old driver from Henan, said the loyalty of drivers is determined by where they could get the best pay. That meant they would continue to follow the subsidies, he said.\u201cAll we care is who gives us the best deal,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Didi buys Uber, we just work for Didi. It doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201dPaul Mozur reported from Hong Kong, and Mike Isaac from San Francisco. Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting from New York.

He was formally arrested in March on the charge of inciting separatism, which can result in a 15-year prison sentence. Mr. Tashi has no known record of advocating Tibetan independence or separatism.Mr. Tashi\u2019s case entered a new phase on Thursday, when the police concluded an additional investigation at the prosecutors\u2019 request and handed over those results. Prosecutors now have about 90 days to decide whether the case should go to court, said Liang Xiaojun, Mr. Tashi\u2019s lawyer.Officials from the United States, Britain and other Western nations have received information on Mr. Tashi\u2019s detention. President Obama and other Western leaders are traveling to China this weekend for the Group of 20 summit meeting, and they may raise human rights issues with Chinese leaders.Mr. Tashi was detained on Jan. 27 by police officers in Yushu, the town on the Tibetan plateau of Qinghai Province where Mr. Tashi lives with his parents.Mr. Tashi, a shopkeeper, wrote blog posts about the disintegration of the Tibetan language among younger Tibetans and urged governments in the region to adopt true bilingual education, using Tibetan and Chinese equally as teaching languages in schools.Mr. Liang, the lawyer, said the police case files, which he had seen on a June visit to Yushu, showed that the police had focused their investigation on Mr. Tashi\u2019s interviews with The Times, which were conducted by this reporter and Jonah M. Kessel, a video journalist. He said the police were especially incensed by the video, produced by Mr. Kessel. (One section of the police case files mistakenly names additional people as producers.)Mr. Liang, who was retained by Mr. Tashi\u2019s family, met separately with Mr. Tashi and the Yushu police chief.\u201cI met with Tashi in the detention center for more than one hour,\u201d he said. \u201cTashi was doing well. He thinks that what he did wasn\u2019t wrong. Tashi said he had had no intention of inciting separatism.\u201dIn his interviews with The Times, Mr. Tashi never advocated Tibetan independence. He said Tibet should remain under Chinese governance and called instead for greater regional autonomy, especially in language use and education. Mr. Tashi also praised Xi Jinping, the Chinese president and Communist Party chief.\u201cAll he wants is to try to preserve Tibetan culture,\u201d Mr. Liang said.He added that it was possible that prosecutors could ask the police for further investigation into Mr. Tashi and delay the decision on whether to bring the case to court.Last year, Mr. Tashi also contacted employees at Alibaba in hopes of getting Jack Ma, the billionaire co-founder of Alibaba, to support his efforts at compelling local officials to expand Tibetan-language education.Advertisement"}

Should we read something more into the fact that the company has recently put out two obviously overtly racist products?What do the ranks of the organization look like in order to make something like this O.K. in the eyes of at least a number of people in the company? Questions of diversity obviously spring to mind \u2014 which Snapchat has never really addressed or divulged numbers on publicly \u2014 and I imagine a more diverse staff might have at least caused some people to question their choices in putting these filters out.If there were indeed people inside of Snapchat that found these filters objectionable \u2014 and I certainly hope there were \u2014 what does the organization structure look like and how does it function in a way that allows these decisions to go unchecked and ultimately carried out?

{"Headline": "Even Uber Couldn\u2019t Bridge the China Divide", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtTravis Kalanick, the co-founder and chief executive of the ride-hailing giant Uber, often defended his eagerness to risk billions on winning the Chinese market with a simple question: If you have a chance to become Amazon and Alibaba at the same time, why not try?The implication was simple. Over the last couple of decades, Amazon, Facebook, Google and other American technology giants have each followed a similar script for world domination. Like an imperial armada rolling out from North America\u2019s West Coast, these companies would try to establish beachheads on every other continent.But when American giants tried to enter the waters of China, the world\u2019s largest internet market, the armada invariably ran aground.Plagued by opaque and ever-shifting regulations and a culturally abstruse way of doing business, American companies fell to a series of local giants. Instead of Google, Baidu. Instead of Facebook, WeChat, owned by the giant Tencent. And instead of Amazon, Alibaba.That has left us with a divide: Today, there is the Chinese internet, and there is the internet of the rest of the world. A network seen in its early days as a tool to foster financial and political unity across a fragmented planet has irrevocably cleaved into two completely separate spheres.Entrepreneurs across the globe can choose to win in China or the rest of the world. You can be Alibaba or you can be Amazon. You can be Uber or you can be Didi. But you can\u2019t be both. Given the rising Chinese market and increasing tension over the role of American tech firms in the rest of the globe, the gulf between the two sides promises to become one of the most important factors in determining the shape of global tech innovation.How exactly might the war play out? In some ways, being at the mercy of two poles of internet leadership could be good for citizens of planet Earth. In emerging markets like India, the Middle East and parts of Africa and South America, the giants of China and the United States are increasingly investing billions to compete for local customers in e-commerce, social networking, ride sharing and other markets.\u201cAmazon is increasingly making its own branded products, taking on Procter & Gamble and others, and also getting into the logistics business, and shipping, and everything else,\u201d Mr. Clark said. \u201cBut Alibaba is a marketplace that doesn\u2019t hold inventory and describes themselves as helping local merchants \u2014 so maybe there\u2019s some argument that Alibaba could serve as a counter globally to Amazon.\u201d\u201cIn that way it could be like the Yalta Conference,\u201d said Mr. Clark, referring to the 1945 meeting in which the victors of World War II determined the postwar geopolitical order.\u201cThe barrels that will be thrown at you when you\u2019re trying to do business in China will just never stop,\u201d said Mark Natkin, the managing director of Marbridge Consulting, an advisory firm based in Beijing. \u201cYou\u2019ll constantly be above one barrel or recovering from jumping one, and as you\u2019re dusting yourself off you look down the road and here comes the next one.\u201dCompared with previous failures, Uber seemed to do everything right in China. It set up a separate company, Uber China, which had a buy-in from local investors, including from a local giant, Baidu. It hired many local experts, and worked closely with the national government to foster friendly relations.Insiders say Mr. Kalanick was also personally invested in the deal. He visited China eight times in the last year and a half, and became something of a tech star in the Chinese media.Publicly Mr. Kalanick had insisted he was fighting for total victory in China. But he must have known that Uber would always struggle to achieve dominance, given the emerging centrality of ride-sharing to the future of infrastructure in China. Still, even if he failed to win everything in China, investing early in the country seemed too big to skip.For now, it\u2019s especially delicious frosting. The $2 billion Uber spent tackling China is now worth about $7 billion in the new merged entity; if Didi does become one of China\u2019s largest tech companies, the value of Uber\u2019s stake in China could rise geometrically, making the firm much more attractive in a potential initial public offering. Pulling out of China also frees up Uber to invest more in other markets \u2014 India and Indonesia are big targets \u2014 as well as expand its expertise in core technological initiatives like mapping data and self-driving cars.But if spending big to tackle China ultimately works out for Uber, it will be an anomaly, and certainly not a model for other American tech giants.\u201cThe ride-sharing market is one the few markets where the upside is big enough to justify going in,\u201d Mr. Thompson said. \u201cFor most other companies, going into China is still going to be nothing but pain.\u201dEmail: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chinese Group to Pay $4.4 Billion for Caesars\u2019 Mobile Games", "Date": "2016-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Gambling may be illegal in mainland China, but that is not stopping Chinese tech investors from betting on casino-style mobile games.The Chinese consortium \u2014 which also includes Yunfeng Capital, the private equity fund of Jack Ma, the chairman of Alibaba \u2014 said it would allow Playtika, based in Israel, to continue to operate independently. The all-cash deal, which is expected to close by the end of the year, does not include Caesars Interactive\u2019s World Series of Poker game or its other real-money game businesses.In recent years, the Montreal-based Caesars Interactive has built Playtika, which it acquired in 2011, into a major player in the world of smartphone-based casino-style games. While many of Playtika\u2019s games, like Slotomania and Bingo Blitz, are free to play, users can also pay for virtual currency and items to enhance play. The virtual currency used in Playtika games will continue to be not exchangeable for real money, according to the statement.While it is not clear when or whether Chinese regulators will accept gambling-style games, the Chinese investment is an example of how internet companies in China often invest first and then worry about legal restrictions. It is also a sign that investors are willing to pay increasingly large sums for smartphone games, which have proved to be one of the best ways to make money from users.While social networking apps may be more popular, mobile games like Clash of Clans and Candy Crush are some of the most profitable apps around. In China, where playing games on a smartphone can often stand in for other entertainment, like going to a movie, technology companies have competed intensely to lure players and the spare change those players are willing to spend on games.For Shanghai Giant Network Technology, acquiring Playtika will also extend its reach beyond China. Other Chinese tech companies have used deals to reach players around the world. Among them is Tencent, which has gained control over internationally well-known games like League of Legends.Advertisement"}
