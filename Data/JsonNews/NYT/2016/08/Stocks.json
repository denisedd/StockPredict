{"Headline": "A Coup, Terrorists and Inflation, Yet Investors Rush to Turkey", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn the face of it, this might not seem the right time to be investing in Turkey.Terrorists attacked the main airport in Istanbul, a foiled coup raised questions about political stability, and the country\u2019s debt is being downgraded by rating agencies \u2014 all of this happening within a span of two weeks.So what were the best-performing investments in the global economy last week?You guessed it: Turkish stocks and bonds \u2014 up 6.6 and 3.8 percent in dollar terms, according to Merrill Lynch.Emerging markets are known for their wild, discordant swings, but this mini-rally in Turkey, brief as it may be, highlights just how much risk yield-starved investors are willing to take on when $11 trillion worth of bonds of governments around the world are offering up negative returns.That is why a Turkish 10-year bond that offers a 9 percent reward can be tempting, even if that country\u2019s inflation rate is 8.7 percent and rising and its currency is heading south.Stocks and bonds in developing markets have been on a tear since early last year, with once-scorned countries like Brazil (stock market up 54 percent in dollar terms for the year) and South Africa (up 24 percent during the same period) leading the way.The surge has been driven in part by a shift in mood by investors choosing to scoop up beaten-down assets in these countries. Emerging-market stocks as a whole are trading at steep discounts to their counterparts in the United States and Europe.A partial recovery in oil prices, political calm in Brazil and a growing sense that Chinese authorities will not allow the renminbi to collapse have also had their effect.At the root of this sudden rush of money into high-risk assets is the pressure that many institutions, from large pension funds and insurance companies to some hedge funds, are facing to find returns in a world of zero to negative interest rates.These pressures have increased since the market shock of the British vote to leave Europe. Bonds yields have continued to shrink and stock markets have hit record highs, giving investors further pause about their overweight positions in developed market stocks and bonds.\u201cIn places like Europe, the U.K. and the U.S., you have lots of risks but no reward,\u201d said Gavin Serkin, an emerging-markets expert at Frontier Funds, a consulting firm based in London. \u201cIn the developing world, you have risks, but at least you are getting paid for it.\u201dAnd that even includes Mongolia, where a new government and a view that commodity markets have bottomed have prompted a stampede into Mongolian government bonds.Other unlikely markets that are now in demand include Russia, where stocks year to date are up over 20 percent in dollar terms. A big factor driving these rallies, traders say, is the sense the currencies of these countries that have suffered from a strong dollar in recent years are now in recovery mode.And while there is still potential for the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates, there is less fear than there was a year ago that rates will push persistently upward and lure money out of emerging economies.Investors are also finding bargains among established companies in emerging markets that have improved their profitability in recent years but still trade at 30 percent discounts to their developed-market peers.\u201cWe are seeing a real shift in sentiment,\u201d said Nick Robinson, a portfolio manager at Aberdeen Investment Management which oversees $420 billion, a large chunk of which is in developing markets. \u201cAnd you really don\u2019t have to look too hard to find good stories with cheap valuations.\u201dAccording to the Institute of International Finance, a bank lobby that tracks global capital flows, about $25 billion poured into emerging markets last month. Asia and Latin America absorbed most of these funds.Combined with the $13 billion that swept into these markets in June, the last two months reflect a sharp shift in sentiment after one of the worst periods ever for emerging-market capital flows.According to the institute\u2019s calculations, $81 billion exited these markets in the months after the Chinese devaluation scare last August \u2014 an amount that approached that $96 billion that fled during the financial crisis.Economists at Institute of International Finance say that the flows surged in the weeks after Britain\u2019s surprise vote to leave the European Union when investors doubled down on their safe-haven bets by buying Japanese, European and United States government bonds.As the yields on these securities vanished late last month, government bonds in Brazil, South Africa and Turkey that yielded around 10 percent began to look attractive.That was especially so when compared with Italy, where comparable securities offered a 1 percent return even with concerns mounting that the country\u2019s banking crisis might force it to leave the euro.Or Japan, where investors in July took the extraordinary step of paying to borrow money for 20 years from a government with the highest debt burden among developed nations.Such minuscule returns are the result of an unprecedented era of monetary policy activism. The world\u2019s central banks have bought up 15 percent of global corporate and sovereign bonds in an effort to stimulate economic recovery.But, as Jan Dehn, the head of research at Ashmore in London, which oversees $51 billion in emerging market assets, points out, these securities do not hail from emerging markets.And that is why, he says, there is such a contrast between bond yields in the developed as opposed to the developing world as investors worldwide have, for the most part, ignored emerging markets in favor of following in the path of central banks.\u201cThe Q.E. trade is over,\u201d said Mr. Dehn, referring to the central bank policy of quantitative easing. \u201cAnd people are now looking to the non-Q.E. world, where the bonds in countries representing 58 percent of G.D.P. had an average yield of 5.6 percent \u2014 which is higher than when the Fed had rates at 5 percent before the crisis. That is pretty extraordinary.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Every Company Is a Tech Company, Does the Label Matter?", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesApple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon have created something of a watershed moment in the stock market.They became the four most valuable companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index at the close of trading on Aug. 1, according to S.&P.\u2019s official tally. That meant that tech companies, by one common definition, occupied the four top spots in the market capitalization rankings, a rare and brief occurrence.\u201cIt may never have happened before at the close of trading,\u201d said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. The full history of daily rankings isn\u2019t readily available, however, so we can\u2019t be certain, and such rankings are evanescent, shifting with every tick of the stock market. In fact, on Friday, Amazon dropped back into sixth place.But no matter: The early August rankings were a reminder of how far tech has come. It is a dominant force in the stock market and the economy, one so all-encompassing that tech may no longer even be a useful concept for understanding today\u2019s stock market.One of them is Exxon Mobil, the energy giant and the most valuable company in the S.&P. as recently as 2012. But Exxon Mobil has been cut down in size by the oil price debacle. The other is Berkshire Hathaway, Warren E. Buffett\u2019s conglomerate, which the S.&P. categorizes as a financial services company \u2014 the only such company left in the Top 10 market cap list. Berkshire announced its own earnings after trading closed on Friday. We\u2019ll soon learn whether the market is pleased enough to vault Berkshire further ahead of Amazon.The three tech companies at the very top in market cap \u2014 Apple, Google and Microsoft \u2014 have held high positions for a long while. (Google, ranked second, trades as Alphabet, the name of its parent company.) Google passed Apple in value briefly this year, but Apple regained the top perch, which it has held since 2012. Microsoft, now No. 3, was the most valuable company during the last tech boom, in the early 2000s.Virtually no one disputes S.&P.\u2019s formal classification of Apple, Google and Microsoft as \u201cinformation technology\u201d companies. The same is true of Facebook, which held seventh place in the latest list of most valuable companies. But while Amazon is often described as a tech company \u2014 and undoubtedly uses and creates innovative technology \u2014 S.&P. has never classified it as one.In fact, Amazon is formally known as a \u201cconsumer discretionary company,\u201d like Walmart, which it has displaced as a member of the Top 10 most valuable companies. Amazon is the only consumer discretionary company left in the Top 10. Is it in some sense a tech company? Certainly, and we\u2019ll get back to that.But the same can be said, to one degree or another, about the three other members of the Top 10 \u2014 old companies that are still prospering in large part because of their mastery of advanced technologies. Johnson & Johnson, for example, which is ranked eighth, is a health care company, yet it is heavily involved in technology of a biological kind. Then there is General Electric, the diversified industrial company (and, until recently, also a financial services company), once described as a bellwether for the entire market. It conducts advanced research and sells tech products.Last on the list is AT&T, a telecommunications company, which, in an early form, helped create computer languages and operating systems on which modern tech companies are built. In 1957, when the S.&P. 500 was born, an ancestral version of AT&T was the most valuable company in the United States by a very wide margin, said Jeremy J. Siegel, a Wharton business school professor, the author of \u201cStocks for the Long Run\u201d and a market historian.\u201cAT&T back then was a highly regulated old phone company,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a giant, later broken up into smaller companies. And it was an outlier, because the other big companies in the S.&P. 500 in that era were mainly materials companies \u2014 like United States Steel, DuPont and Union Carbide \u2014 and an awful lot of oil companies.\u201dIn 1957, the economy ran on oil, and the biggest energy company was Standard Oil of New Jersey \u2014 an ancestor of Exxon Mobil. No pure tech company ranked in the Top 10 back then, not even IBM, which soon became the dominant tech company, a position it held until Microsoft surpassed it in the mid-1990s. That was the decade of the great tech boom, culminating in the bubble that burst in March 2000. Microsoft was No. 1 in market cap at the end of 1999, and four other tech companies \u2014 Cisco Systems, Intel, IBM and America Online \u2014 were also among the Top 10 most valuable companies. The stock market celebrated tech\u2019s ascendance then, as it does now.But this is a different era. When you dig deeper into the S.&P. 500, it\u2019s clear that while the valuations of tech companies swelled to unrealistically high proportions in those bubble years, the valuations of most companies are far more modest now. In March 2000, the height of the bubble, the value of information technology companies swelled to 34.5 percent of the total market cap of the S.&P. 500. At the moment, the comparable figure is only 20.7 percent, data from the Bespoke Investment Group shows. That\u2019s not much more than the 15.7 percent share of financial companies or the 15.2 percent share of the health care sector. By contrast, finance ballooned as high as 22.3 percent at the end of 2006, in what can be seen in hindsight as a financial bubble.On the other hand, materials and energy companies, which together constituted almost half of the total value of the S.&P. 500 in 1957, now account for less than 10 percent of it. That reflects the collapse of energy and commodity prices over the last few years, and it may well be a temporary phenomenon. In the meantime, diversified energy companies like Exxon Mobil are investing heavily in technology, a necessity if they are to flourish.It\u2019s clear even to energy companies, in other words, that tech\u2019s abiding power in the marketplace is not temporary. Technology permeates every sector of the economy, even those not formally classified as high-tech. Whether companies like Amazon and Johnson & Johnson should carry tech labels is beside the point. Tech has already taken over.These days every company is a tech company, but some have better niches, faster growth, more attractive offerings or more favorable share prices than others. These kinds of fundamental distinctions will influence the Top 10 rankings of the future.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Has Wall Street Been Tamed?", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyBefore the financial crisis, bankers were often regarded as greedy and self-\u00adinterested. The mortgage melt down \u00adratcheted that reputation into something much scarier: an existential threat to the global economy. Since 2008, the banks have seemed to many people like an active volcano does to the villagers below. Americans don\u2019t really understand banks, or know what causes them to blow up, but they\u2019ve seen enough to be afraid.And to hear the public discussion about the issue these days, we still have good reason to be scared. The Republican presidential candidates generally agreed that Wall Street banks remain dangerously too big to fail. On the left, Bernie Sanders built that notion \u2014 and demands for a major policy response to it \u2014 into the foundation of his campaign. From Hollywood, we got \u201cThe Big Short\u201d and its judgment, in the words of Ryan Gosling\u2019s character, that \u201cthe banks took the money the American people gave them and used it to lobby the Congress to kill big reform.\u201dI began writing about the industry in early 2010, just after the worst of the crisis passed and right before Congress enacted its landmark effort to clean up Wall Street, what\u2019s now known as Dodd-Frank. I was in Washington when the final version of the law was released. Along with all the discussion about its being the most significant reform of Wall Street since the Great Depression, I remember the confusion as we flipped through the thousands of pages, trying to pick out what would really matter, looking for where the lobbyists had won. Six years later, as I plan a move to the West Coast for a slightly different reporting beat, I keep returning to this question of how much has really changed. Is the system any safer than when I began?Dodd-Frank was designed, in essence, to check the pre-\u00adcrisis excesses that ultimately required the government to bail out the largest banks. But upon its unveiling, it did seem as though some of the most consequential efforts to transform the banks had been edited out at the industry\u2019s behest. The law didn\u2019t seem to address many of the risky practices that transmuted a downturn in the subprime-\u00admortgage market into a global conflagration. Perhaps most consequential, as Sanders has not tired of reminding us, the biggest banks were not broken up. Just a day after the law was passed, a bank analyst made a prediction for me: \u201cAfter the dust settles and they\u2019ve crossed all the T\u2019s, there\u2019s probably not going to be much difference in how the banking industry looks. That\u2019s the long and short of it.\u201d\u00adJPMorgan Chase, the nation\u2019s largest bank, has shrunk since 2014, but it entered 2016 with 50 percent more assets than it had in 2007, in great part because of its acquisition (on the cheap) of Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual in 2008. Early this spring, the top banking regulators announced that because of their size and complexity, five of the eight largest banks, including JPMorgan, still didn\u2019t have workable plans to avoid going out of business without taking the economy down with them \u2014 suggesting that they would probably need to be bailed out if they began to collapse again.So are they headed toward failure? To judge the likelihood of that, the first thing to consider is what types of risk they\u2019re taking on. And on that front, at least, the changes have been far more notable than most Americans realize. For starters, Dodd-Frank\u2019s \u201cVolcker Rule\u201d forced the banks to get rid of the trading desks where they made enormous speculative bets for their own profit. There was some talk that the banks would find a way around the rule, but almost every bank has disbanded these trading teams or sold them to hedge funds. And this is just one of the risky businesses that the big banks have jettisoned in recent years. The most risky \u2014 and profitable \u2014 units at all the banks before the crisis were the so-\u00adcalled fixed-\u00adincome divisions, where the banks created and traded bonds and derivatives. In 2006, these departments were the single largest sources of revenue at banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Today, by contrast, the amount of money the big banks make from their fixed-\u00adincome divisions is less than half of what it was at the peak in 2009, and it continues to fall.There are multiple reasons for this evolution, including global economic shocks like the Greek debt crisis and the new trading rules in Dodd-Frank. But the greatest engine of change has been some rather arcane accounting rules, known as capital requirements, set by the central banks of governments around the world. Put most simply, capital requirements force banks to raise a specific amount of money (usually from investors) for every dollar they lend or trade. In 2010, central banks agreed that the large commercial banks needed to double or even triple their capital buffers. Riskier ventures require even more capital.The most immediate impact of these rules has been to serve as a sort of brake on business activity, given the hassle and cost of raising more capital. And indeed, when banks today explain why they are moving into or abandoning certain businesses, they almost always cite capital requirements as their main motivation. The Federal Reserve official in charge of these regulations, Daniel Tarullo, was recently called \u201cthe most powerful man in banking\u201d by The Wall Street Journal. Tarullo is now pushing to raise the capital requirements even higher for the very largest banks, like JPMorgan and Citigroup, and there are signs that this could do what Bernie Sanders could not: force the biggest banks to split themselves up.Among the many shrinking banks, one of the most noteworthy is Goldman Sachs, a villain of the crisis and the firm everyone assumed would outsmart the regulators. In large part because of capital requirements and their quieting effect on all sorts of trading, Goldman has slashed staff from the risky, lucrative lines of businesses it used to dominate. Now the firm is focusing its efforts in less risky places, where capital requirements are lower. Its newest products are savings accounts and consumer loans, plebeian products that Goldman would never have deigned to offer before the crisis. The company as a whole has shrunk by nearly a quarter since its peak.Even highly capitalized banks can still suffer unexpected losses. But in addition to discouraging risky activity, capital also serves as money that banks can afford to lose in a crisis. Unlike the debt that banks loaded up on before the crisis, capital does not have to be repaid in the event of a loss. Having this sort of cushion can in turn stop losses from spiraling out into and threatening the rest of the economy. The nation\u2019s eight most important banks now have 66 percent more capital than they did at the end of 2009, and the Fed recently said, after extensive testing, that the nation\u2019s 33 largest banks could survive a two-year depression \u2014 and lose hundreds of billions of dollars \u2014 and still have more capital than the new rules require.Michael Lewis, the author of \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d has been one of many industry critics to complain that the biggest continuing problem in the financial industry is that the incentives haven\u2019t changed: Bankers are encouraged to take short-term risks, without bearing the losses if those risks cause long-term damage. In fact, pay packages have changed more than Lewis lets on. Some traders now receive their bonuses over several years, in case past deals go sour, and regulators are currently codifying those practices.But to focus on pay packages misses how capital requirements have changed incentives for the entire system. I hear constantly from traders who say that the daily work of buying and selling bonds or stocks, and thus the amount of money they can take home, is constrained by the capital limits. This helps explain why at Goldman, for example, the average pay per employee has fallen 24 percent since 2010 and 39 percent since 2007. This also illuminates why Wall Street is in decline as the career path of choice at elite colleges and business schools.People still have other concerns about Wall Street, including cases of fraud and market manipulation, so the banks are unlikely to disappear as political fodder in a presidential campaign between two New Yorkers for whom Wall Street is a recurring issue. Each side is likely to signal its intent to get tough on the industry that nearly wiped out the economy. But if Wall Street remains a volcano, it\u2019s one I now feel far more safe living underneath.Nathaniel Popper is a reporter for The Times and the author of \u201cDigital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money.\u201d Adam Davidson will return next month.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Zen and the Art of 401(k) Maintenance", "Date": "2016-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyHere\u2019s how to get better returns in your retirement account: Pay as little attention to it as possible.Fidelity, which has received inquiries about the study ever since, without knowing why, told me this week that it had never produced such a study.How disappointing, given how tantalizingly counterintuitive the supposed conclusion was: Perhaps chasing headlines and darting in and out of stocks and bonds as hedge fund managers do wasn\u2019t necessary after all.We humans tend to experience pain from losses much more acutely than whatever joy we might experience from an equal-size gain. \u201cIf you\u2019re watching as the markets go down, you are twice as unhappy as you would be happy if they went up by the same amount,\u201d Professor Pagel said. \u201cSo looking at the market is, on average, painful.\u201dSo stop looking so much. Consider turning off paper statements and email notifications for retirement accounts that you won\u2019t need to draw on for several years. Most people\u2019s accounts fall into that category \u2014 even those on the brink of what will hopefully be a multidecade retirement. The less we look, the less tempted we\u2019ll be to act to try to alleviate that pain.But many of us will look anyway. We are rubberneckers, masochists, cravers of information. We convince ourselves that since the facts are different this time, then perhaps our behavior should be, too.So should we touch our investments the next time markets take a prolonged dive? This is something Fidelity actually has studied. After the stock market collapse in 2008 and early 2009, the company noticed that 61,200 401(k) account holders had sold all of their stock. So the company started tracking them to see whether that move would pay off.Since then, 16,900 had not bought stocks in their retirement accounts through the end of 2015. About 13,000 of them are under 60, so they probably didn\u2019t just cash out and take early retirement either. Through the end of 2015, their account balances rose by 27.2 percent, including new contributions.People who had at least some stock exposure, however, saw their accounts jump 157.7 percent. That left them with an average balance of $176,500, $82,000 more than the people who got rid of all their stock. Now imagine that $82,000 difference compounding over 20 or 30 more years, and think hard about whether you want to touch the stocks in your retirement fund the next time the markets fall far.This is an extreme example but an important one, given that plenty of smart people capitulate when faced with the pain of looking too hard at fast-falling balances. Even when market moves aren\u2019t quite as severe, people still tend to fiddle with their holdings. In the second quarter of this year, 13 percent of Fidelity 401(k) account holders did so.Left to our own devices, picking and choosing among a variety of funds, we\u2019re likely to change our minds often and flit in and out of things. According to Morningstar data examining 1,930 stock mutual funds over 15 years ending in June, the difference between what the funds would have delivered to steadfast investors and what the average investor (who did not hang around for that long) actually earned was 0.99 percentage points. That doesn\u2019t seem like much, but a one percentage point difference in returns can mean missing out on many hundreds of thousands of dollars in returns over the decades.But when I told Professor Pagel that Mr. Shaughnessy\u2019s interviewer, Barry Ritholtz, had wondered whether the punch line to the study might be that the most successful Fidelity account holders were the dead ones, she thought he might be onto something. \u201cEven if it\u2019s not true, it\u2019s actually true,\u201d she said. \u201cDead people can\u2019t get upset from seeing the market go down.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Disney is buying one-third of the operation and will have the option to take control someday.The long-serving Mr. Iger has won acclaim for big acquisitions, including Marvel\u2019s superheroes and George Lucas\u2019s Star Wars franchise.

Ackman, the billionaire investor, is once again shaking up his underperforming hedge fund\u2019s portfolio by selling off a big equity stake in the railway company Canadian Pacific.Mr. Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square Capital Management on Wednesday sold its entire stake of 9.8 million shares in Canadian Pacific Railway in a series of trades arranged by Bank of America, Credit Suisse and JPMorgan Chase. The shares were valued at about $1.5 billion based on Tuesday\u2019s closing price. Canadian Pacific shares closed on Wednesday at $147.28.The move comes during another rough year for the well-known activist investor and his $11.9 billion firm.As of the end of July, Pershing Square Holdings, a publicly traded fund, was down 19 percent for the year. Last year, it shed 20.5 percent.Mr. Ackman runs a highly concentrated portfolio that places big bets on a small number of companies, often accompanied by the managers\u2019 demands for corporate changes. As such, Pershing Square is particularly vulnerable to significant declines in the prices of just a few stocks.The hedge fund has investments in about a dozen stocks, and it has been selling off big stakes in several of its better-performing positions throughout the year. Hedge funds sell stakes in their portfolio companies to meet investor redemptions or to put money into new investments. In recent weeks, Pershing Square officials in meetings with investors have referred to the proceeds from stock sales as \u201cdry powder\u201d that could be used for a future stock purchase.In a recent conference call, Mr. Ackman said investor requests to redeem money from the firm were running below average this year despite the firm\u2019s disappointing performance.Mr. Ackman specializes in making big, concentrated bets. Sometimes his investments score big, but that\u2019s not always the case. Here\u2019s how some of his ideas have fared.In April, the firm sold 4.1 million of the shares it had in Canadian Pacific, which at the time reduced its overall stake by 30 percent.Pershing Square has suffered outsize losses on several stocks in its portfolio \u2014 most notably Valeant Pharmaceuticals. The troubled drug company\u2019s shares have fallen 78 percent this year as it has come under pressure for its pricing strategies and for some of its sales distribution practices. Mr. Ackman is now a member of Valeant\u2019s board and has told investors that he intends to take a hands-on approach to overseeing the company\u2019s turnaround.The hedge fund\u2019s big bearish bet on Herbalife, the nutritional food supplement company, worked against it once again this year. Shares of Herbalife are up 24 percent this year even after the company paid $200 million to the Federal Trade Commission to settle an investigation into its business practices.The settlement with the F.T.C., however, was something of a moral victory for Mr. Ackman, who has waged a high-octane campaign against Herbalife, claiming it is an unlawful pyramid scheme that takes advantage of its customers \u2014 many of whom are either poor or of modest means. The F.T.C. stopped short of calling Herbalife a pyramid scheme and ordering it to shut down. But the regulatory agency did charge the company with \u201cdeceiving hundreds of thousands of hopeful people,\u201d and directed it to make substantial changes to its sales practices and hire an outside monitor to oversee its activities.Mr. Ackman has said his firm is maintaining its \u201cshort\u201d bet, which will prove profitable if Herbalife\u2019s stock price collapses. Mr. Ackman has said Herbalife\u2019s revenue and profit will tumble if it changes its business practices as the F.T.C. has ordered.Canadian Pacific has been one of Pershing Square\u2019s better-performing investments. The firm began buying shares and establishing a big stake in the company in 2011, when the stock was selling for just under $50. Pershing Square would go on to win a proxy contest to install new board members and ultimately E. Hunter Harrison as chief executive.\u201cCanadian Pacific has completed an incredible transformation since our initial investment in 2011,\u201d Mr. Ackman said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cHunter Harrison and Keith Creel\u201d \u2014 the railroad\u2019s chief operating officer \u2014 \u201chave restored to greatness one of North America\u2019s top railroads and have set the company on the path to continued success.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wrenching Choice in South Sudan: Starve or Risk Rape", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJUBA, South Sudan \u2014 At a sprawling displacement camp on the outskirts of the capital, women have faced a wrenching choice: risk starvation or sexual assault.When her family ran out of food last month, Angelina Nhokmar, a 20-year-old mother of two, ventured outside the camp\u2019s gates. She said she was lucky to have made it to the market and back unharmed, because dozens of women were raped by government soldiers in recent weeks as they made the same journey.\u201cIt\u2019s not safe,\u201d she said, tossing handfuls of sorghum into a pot of boiling water. \u201cOur enemies are outside.\u201dNearly 30,000 people have been sheltering at United Nations sites around the capital, Juba, since South Sudan erupted into civil war in 2013. For more than two years, soldiers loyal to President Salva Kiir \u2014 who belongs to the Dinka ethnic group, South Sudan\u2019s largest \u2014 battled troops led by Riek Machar of the Nuer ethnic group, which is believed to be the second largest.Tens of thousands of people lost their lives in the war, and troops on both sides committed human rights abuses against civilians on a devastating scale.For years, the displacement camps have been worlds unto themselves: communities complete with churches, shops and schools. But they are also plagued by overcrowding, recurring shortages of basic goods, and the uncertainty faced by residents who have no idea when, if ever, they will feel safe enough to leave.So they stay, cloistered inside barbed-wire fences guarded by United Nations troops who have failed to keep peace in the capital or even to prevent assaults just outside the camps\u2019 perimeters.Sexual assaults in Juba surged last month, to at least 217 reported cases, the United Nations human rights chief, Zeid Ra\u2019ad al-Hussein, said Thursday in a statement. Members of South Sudan\u2019s own national army, he said, seemed to be responsible for most of the assaults. And most of the victims, he added, were displaced Nuer women and girls.Many were women living in the camps who ventured out to the markets when food ran out. Others were fleeing the clashes and making their way to the displacement sites for the first time.The civilians who came to these camps in 2013 were overwhelmingly Nuer. Last week, thousands of them demonstrated against Mr. Kiir for recognizing a new vice president to take Mr. Machar\u2019s place, calling it a violation of the peace deal.Such a gathering would be unimaginable now in central Juba. The streets of the capital are firmly under the control of the president\u2019s forces, though they are still tense. Many properties have been destroyed, and many more looted \u2014 often by men wearing army uniforms.International partners have also suffered, including the United Nations peacekeeping mission, which lost two Chinese soldiers to crossfire inside the camp last month, and the World Food Program, whose main warehouse in South Sudan was looted from top to bottom in one of the worst such episodes the organization has experienced in years.It wasn\u2019t just the food, which totaled about 4,500 metric tons and consisted mostly of nutritional supplements for children and pregnant or nursing mothers, according to a spokeswoman, Challiss McDonough.\u201cEverything was stripped,\u201d she said. \u201cTechnical equipment, generators, fuel stocks \u2014 every single thing was gone.\u201dAlso stolen were several trucks specially outfitted to deliver food across the country, a near-impossible task for normal vehicles in the current rainy season. That means the warehouse looting in Juba, which would have required a herculean effort involving hundreds of people over several days, will have ripple effects all across this desperately hungry country.Last week, the World Food Program, which still has a smaller warehouse in the vicinity of the capital, delivered a new shipment of food to the camps. But there is not enough for everyone. People said they had been asked to share their rations with thousands of newcomers.This has led to some friction, said Charles Longa, 25, a new arrival. Like many of the most recently displaced, he is not Nuer but Equatorian, a catchall term encompassing ethnic groups from the country\u2019s diverse south.\u201cThe people who have been living here for a long time are telling us we\u2019d better go home,\u201d he said, blaming food shortages for the rising tensions. \u201cWe Equatorians don\u2019t want to be in here, begging. We want to be out there, farming.\u201dLike many other new arrivals, Mr. Longa and his children had not yet been given a tent and were sheltering in a school in the center of the largest displacement site. He said he feared for his safety when, shortly after he arrived, an Equatorian was blamed for a killing just outside the camp, spurring a brief protest outside the school.William Tejok Toch, a community leader in the camp, acknowledged that the schoolyard had briefly been targeted, requiring intervention from United Nations police officers. \u201cIn the camps, we have our criminals,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we manage the situation.\u201dSome who fled the clashes last month crowded into schools and churches in Juba, saying they did not want to risk the journey to the United Nations camps.Others said they had made the dangerous trek, but were turned away. \u201cIf you give shelter, you should give it to everyone,\u201d said Azen Aziuphia, 41, who said that he, his wife and his son had been denied entry.He accused the peacekeepers of refusing to admit Equatorians like him, though the United Nations says it does not discriminate on the basis of ethnicity.The United Nations humanitarian chief, Stephen O\u2019Brien, acknowledged that the sites had limited space, and that the registration of newcomers had been slow. He added that the camps were meant to accommodate only those with nowhere else to go.The camps were caught in the crossfire during the clashes last month, and at least 16 people died. Some families have buried loved ones on the edges of the camp, just beyond a coil of barbed wire. Now, the refuge is hemmed in on two sides by rows of shallow graves topped with makeshift crosses.Gatleak Jal, 32, who fled to the camp in 2013, suspects that Mr. Kiir\u2019s troops deliberately targeted the United Nations sites. When gunshots were fired just beyond the walls three weeks ago, he was shot three times in the arm as he ran toward his tent, and then two times more \u2014 once in the abdomen, once in the leg \u2014 after he ducked into a trench for shelter.In a crowded medical center inside the camp, he lifted his shirt to reveal a patchwork of bloody bandages. \u201cThey didn\u2019t put any medicine on this, because they ran out,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re only washing it with water.\u201dMr. Longa, the new arrival, grew wistful thinking about the three brothers he had lost in three separate conflicts. One died in the war for independence against Sudan, another in the civil war two years ago, and one more in clashes last month, he said.All three were members of the army, he added. But now he wonders what they were fighting for.\u201cWe used to go to war for land, or for freedom,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now they are confusing us, and making it about tribe.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated, at two points, the month during which the most recent clashes in South Sudan occurred. As correctly noted elsewhere in the article, they were in July, not August.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Two Years of Negative Interest Rates in Europe Tell Us", "Date": "2016-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialHoping to kick-start European economies, the European Central Bank took the extraordinary step two years ago of lowering one of its key interest rates to below zero. The idea was to discourage banks from stashing their money in the central bank by charging them a modest rate for doing so. Since the banks would lose money rather than earn interest on their deposits, it was hoped they would be prompted instead to make more loans at lower rates to businesses and consumers.It hasn\u2019t worked very well. As many experts predicted at the time, the policy has had only a modest impact on growth. It is also increasingly clear that pushing rates down further wouldn\u2019t help much and could, in fact, increase risks to the global financial system.Meanwhile, continuing to rely on negative rates could be dangerous. The worry among many experts is that banks, institutional investors and even individuals desperate for higher returns might be seduced into taking foolish risks. They might also be tempted to make big investments overseas, driving up the price of stocks and bonds in the United States and Asia and creating bubbles that expose the global financial system and economy to another crisis. Some analysts are already worried about high prices for real estate, stocks and other assets.Advertisement"}

Jason Yue Shen, a friend of the couple who became a Universal Life minister for the event, officiated at the Castlewood Country Club in Pleasanton, Calif.The couple met at Stanford, from which they graduated and where the groom received a master\u2019s degree in Russian, East European and Eurasian Studies, and where he w as co-captain of the men\u2019s gymnastics team that won the Division I National Collegiate Athletic Association championship in 2009.Dr. Yu, 30, is keeping her name. On Aug. 16, she completed her internship in clinical psychology at the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System in Palo Alto, Calif., where next month she will become a postdoctoral fellow in its Behavioral Medicine Program.

His father is a senior staff software engineer at Harmonic, a telecommunications equipment supplier in San Jose.Ms. Yu and Mr. Ter-Zakhariants moved into their 200-person dormitory at Stanford in September 2006, but they did not become acquainted until the following March, shortly after Mr. Ter-Zakhariants dislocated his finger at a gymnastics meet on campus.\u201cI was watching him perform on the parallel bars when he got hurt,\u201d Ms. Yu said. \u201cI had never seen him before, but I felt really bad for him and wanted to reach out, so I sent him an email to see how he was doing.\u201dSeveral days passed and she did not get a response. \u201cI remember thinking, \u2018That\u2019s pretty rude,\u2019\u201d she said.A week later, Ms. Yu crossed paths with Mr. Ter-Zakhariants, who told her that he had received her email, along with many other notes from well-wishers, but was having trouble responding swiftly as his dislocated finger made typing difficult.As it turned out, they began bumping into each other in the dorm room of a mutual friend.\u201cWe became friends,\u201d Ms. Yu said. \u201cWe started hanging out a little, and I began to realize just how sweet and kind he was, and that he was someone who became dedicated and committed to any goal he set for himself.\u201dMr. Ter-Zakhariants had come to a realization about her, too. \u201cI was amazed as to how intelligent, driven and down-to-earth she was,\u201d he said.By June, Ms. Yu said, she \u201cbegan to have feelings for him.\u201dAnd, though he was feeling much the same, their relationship remained platonic. \u201cI\u2019m a pretty shy person,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I was constantly hinting that we should start dating.\u201dAfter graduation, both Ms. Yu and Mr. Ter-Zakhariants took jobs at Stanford, she as a research assistant and he as a gymnastics coach.

{"Headline": "Strong Job Gains, for Second Month, Reframe Economic Outlook", "Date": "2016-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe American jobs machine has moved back into high gear.After a long stretch of conflicting reports, the Labor Department said on Friday that the economy in July delivered a second consecutive month of robust hiring and rising wages in a signal that the expansion is strengthening, not ebbing, as it enters its eighth year.Stocks surged, experts expressed more confidence that the Federal Reserve was likely to raise interest rates before the end of the year, and it was clear that long-stagnant wages for ordinary workers were advancing at a healthier pace.\u201cThis was everything you could have asked for, maybe more,\u201d said Michelle Meyer, head of United States economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing new entrants into the labor market, which implies a longer runway for the business cycle.\u201dWith the political conventions completed, the buoyant jobs numbers also have major implications for the presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.Not only does the new data undercut Republican arguments that the recovery is faltering, it also suggests that after years of paltry gains, deeply frustrated workers are finally seeing some benefits from the drop in unemployment, which was unchanged last month at a relatively low 4.9 percent.Wages are up 2.6 percent over the last 12 months, a faster pace than earlier in the recovery, and many economists expect that the gain in incomes, adjusted for inflation, will accelerate later this year and into 2017.\u201cThe idea that Republicans are touting, that the job market is a wreck, is clearly belied by the data,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, an economist who served in the Obama administration. \u201cWhat matters most to people isn\u2019t G.D.P. growth, it\u2019s jobs and wages.\u201dLongtime G.O.P. economic hands like Wayne Berman, a veteran of several Republican presidential campaigns, conceded Friday\u2019s data was favorable for Democrats, but insisted it represented a snapshot of the economy, not necessarily the underlying trends. A major failing in the recovery, Republicans note, is that millions of Americans who dropped out of the work force during the recession have still not found jobs.July\u2019s jobs number \u201cis a good statistic for Clinton to pivot towards,\u201d said Mr. Berman, who currently serves as a top official at the Blackstone Group and advised Senator Marco Rubio of Florida during the Republican primary. He noted, however, that the economy grew at an annual rate of just 1 percent in the first half of 2016, a sharp decrease from last year.\u201cWe\u2019re in a very mixed economic picture now,\u201d said Mr. Berman, recalling the presidential campaign of Senator Bob Dole two decades ago, when attacks on Bill Clinton\u2019s economic record failed to resonate at a time of rising prosperity. \u201cYou can\u2019t say this is like 1996, when there was no oxygen for Bob Dole\u2019s arguments.\u201dThe July increase in payrolls stands in sharp contrast to data released just last week showing disappointing economic growth in April, May and June.A reason for the difference is that parts of the economy are still suffering from the continuing fallout from low oil prices as energy companies cut back on investment. Government spending also has been weak and many companies, at least for now, prefer to hire more workers rather than invest in new equipment and increase their efficiency and output.If business and government investment continue to lag, that could undermine the long-term ability of the American economy to be more productive and raise living standards for most workers.In late spring, the government reported that job creation in May was much weaker than economists had expected; a big rebound in June similarly caught the experts off guard. The July data helps clear up some of the confusion.\u201cThis is a validator,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays. \u201cThis is a report that indicates that the slowdown in hiring earlier in the year has been reversed.\u201dJune\u2019s gain was revised upward by 5,000 jobs, and May\u2019s by 13,000. The combination of better gains in the spring and July\u2019s increase in hiring means that the Federal Reserve is likely to have a more vigorous debate about raising interest rates when it meets in September. But most experts think the Fed will wait until December to be sure the economy remains on a solid track.The Fed said in July, after the most recent meeting of its policy-making committee, that the economy was growing more strongly and there were fewer clouds on the horizon, suggesting it was giving greater consideration to rate increases later this year.But on the policy-making front, William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and an influential adviser to Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, said on Sunday that current economic conditions still called for \u201ccaution in raising U.S. short-term interest rates.\u201dJob openings are spreading. \u201cIt\u2019s been a really good summer for hiring all across the country,\u201d said Tom Gimbel, chief executive of LaSalle Network, a recruiting and staffing firm based in Chicago. \u201cBusiness has been great. Kids coming out of college are getting hired, and we\u2019re seeing a lot of activity in the $50,000 to $150,000 category.\u201dThe upswing in jobs last month also coincided with a sharp drop in unemployment among the least-educated workers, a group that has missed out on nearly all the gains of the current recovery thus far.The broadest measure of unemployment calculated by the Labor Department, which includes workers who want full-time positions but cannot find them, stood at 9.7 percent in July.The payroll figures, which reflect hiring at companies and in the public sector, revealed broad-based job gains, not just in lower-paid sectors like retail and leisure and hospitality, but in high-paying fields like professional and business services as well.The household survey, which has offered a mixed picture in the past, was also robust.The jobless rate for high school dropouts, which has been elevated throughout the recovery, fell more than a full percentage point to 6.3 percent, suggesting that employers who had previously ignored these lower-skilled workers are now taking a second look.But a two-tier job market remains in place, with workers in the same region facing radically different conditions depending on their level of education and skills.In San Francisco, even the most junior software engineers hired at Sunverge, a maker of energy storage systems for solar electricity users, command starting salaries of just over $100,000.A little more than 60 miles to the east, at Sunverge\u2019s assembly plant in Stockton, Calif., where the unemployment rate is 9 percent, new blue-collar workers can expect to earn about $14 an hour, or $29,000 a year.Sunverge is bulking up in both cities. But hiring technical talent is much more time-consuming, said Stu Statman, Sunverge\u2019s chief of engineering.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s that hard to find good factory workers in Stockton,\u201d Mr. Statman said. \u201cIn San Francisco, if you\u2019re talking about software engineers or developers, it\u2019s very hard. It takes a long time, and there\u2019s a huge amount of hunger out there for people with these skills.\u201dBinyamin Appelbaum contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Syria, Battles for Aleppo Seem as Endless as the War Itself", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 The battle for Aleppo \u2014 Syria\u2019s most populous city \u2014 is once again raging, once again trapping hundreds of thousands of civilians, once again rallying fighters seeking an advantage in the five-year-old civil war.But it is just as likely that Aleppo will continue to burn, the war will move no closer to resolution \u2014 and many people will continue to suffer and die.\u201cEvery day we have wounded, every day we have sick people,\u201d Abdulqader Habak, an activist in the city\u2019s rebel-held eastern part, said via Skype. He and other activists have also reported an increase in attacks using chemical gases, increasing civilian misery.Life is slightly better in the western part of the city, where the government of President Bashar al-Assad maintains control and there are no airstrikes. But food stocks there have dwindled, some areas are without water and electricity, and many fear that the ability of Mr. Assad\u2019s forces to protect them is slipping.\u201cToday, I went around for one hour looking for chicken and I couldn\u2019t find any,\u201d said Safwan, a merchant in western Aleppo who gave only his first name for fear of retribution for speaking to foreign news media. He said there were long lines at gas stations, bare shelves at fruit and vegetable stores, and hospitals overloaded with wounded soldiers, militiamen and civilians.Aleppo, Syria\u2019s industrial center before the war, has emerged as the conflict\u2019s latest high-stakes battleground as the warring parties pour in fighters and resources to try to strike a definitive blow against their foes.But in many ways, the battle for Aleppo reflects the wider struggle for Syria after five years of war, an increasingly intractable conflict in which the combatants invest all they have, but come no closer to defeating each other or reaching a political solution.Ramzy Mardini, a Middle East analyst at the Atlantic Council, said the conflict had become like a line of dominoes in which the pieces are spread too far apart to knock others over as they fall.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like one victory leads to another to a point where there is a convergence of victories going on for either side,\u201d he said.Aleppo has been divided since 2012, with the Assad government holding the west while rebels seeking to topple the government hold districts in the east and much of the surrounding countryside.They succeeded over the weekend, although control of the road remains too tenuous to allow for regular aid access. And 18 people were killed on Friday in airstrikes around Aleppo Province, medical crews and conflict monitors said.Both the pro-Assad forces and the rebel fighters saw the battle as crucial to their progress in the war, and the fight revealed their strengths and weaknesses.\u201cThe fighters attacking the regime from inside and outside Aleppo fought fiercely, knowing that this battle was a fateful one and would lift the siege on their families and children,\u201d said Zakaria Malahifji, the political chief of a rebel group backed by the C.I.A. and its counterparts in European and Arab states.But spearheading the rebel effort were hard-line Islamist groups including the Levant Conquest Front, which has been affiliated with Al Qaeda for years and only recently changed its name and claimed to have become independent. While American officials dismissed the rebranding, saying the group did not change its ideology or its goal of establishing an Islamic emirate in Syria, analysts said it allowed the jihadists to work more closely with other rebel groups, blurring the lines between them.That complicates matters for the United States, which has tried to drive a wedge between the extremists and other rebels, and targeted the former with airstrikes. The jihadists\u2019 prominent role in the Aleppo offensive showed that they remain militarily indispensable to the wider rebel movement and increased their popularity at time when many Syrians criticize the United States for not doing more to protect Syrian civilians.For the Syrian government, the rebels\u2019 swift breaking of the siege exposed the limits of its forces, who have become heavily dependent on foreign allies. Syria\u2019s army has been ground down during the war through death, defections and frequent deployments. Russia has intervened to help out with airstrikes on rebel forces, and Hezbollah has sent skilled fighters who have led a number of advances. That combination has helped the government take territory, although it lacks the native forces needed to hold it.The United States has not played a major role in the battle for Aleppo, instead focusing its effort on weakening the jihadists of the Islamic State, who have no significant presence in the city but control territory farther east.There, American-backed forces have nearly succeeded in pushing the jihadists from Minbij, a town near the Turkish border that has served as a jihadist hub.The greatest price for the recent fighting has been paid by Aleppo\u2019s civilians. The encirclement of the rebel-held districts has left residents with dwindling supplies, and Syrian and Russian airstrikes frequently target civilian areas, damaging homes and medical facilities. And recent days have seen reports of poison gas attacks on rebel neighborhoods that have left residents sick.This week, 15 doctors in eastern Aleppo released a public letter to President Obama, saying that 42 medical facilities had been targeted in July and calling for help to stop the bombs.\u201cContinued U.S. inaction to protect the civilians of Syria means that our plight is being willfully tolerated by those in the international corridors of power,\u201d the letter read, accusing the United States and other world powers of standing idly by.The deprivation and violence are greatest in the rebel-held areas.Zahid Qaturji, a doctor at a hospital in eastern Aleppo, said his facility was bombed in April, killing five staff members and destroying the intensive-care unit and operating room. The staff salvaged what it could and kept working, now struggling to treat about 120 patients per day. He said the work keeps him too busy to consider where Aleppo is heading.\u201cWe don\u2019t think about the future very much,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are happy to live each day and survive.\u201dBut he said he did not expect the war to change course unless world powers can agree to end it.\u201cHopefully there will be an end to the Syrian civilians\u2019 misery, but we can\u2019t see a light in the future,\u201d he said.Karam Shoumali contributed reporting from Istanbul, Hwaida Saad from Beirut, and an employee of The New York Times from Damascus, Syria.Advertisement"}

Legg Mason, which is based in Baltimore, said Thursday that Mr. Miller had agreed to purchase the entirety of the firm\u2019s interests in LMM, giving him full ownership of the entity.In the 1990s and the early part of the 2000s, Mr. Miller was the Joe DiMaggio of mutual fund investors, achieving fame for beating the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index for 15 consecutive years, from 1991 to 2005.But with the advent of exchange-traded funds and the investing public\u2019s embrace of passive, low-cost investing as opposed to active stock picking, Mr. Miller\u2019s style has fallen out of favor.A deep-value investor who made big, concentrated bets on a select number of companies and then stuck with them through their worst days, Mr. Miller embodied the active style of mutual fund investing that prevailed in the earlier era.And even though stocks of technology companies are not typically what value investors buy, he was an early booster of AOL and Dell and was among the first mutual fund managers that bet big on Amazon.In its heyday, Legg Mason Value Trust was one of the biggest, most popular mutual funds around, and Mr. Miller regularly graced the covers of the many personal finance magazines that flourished during this period.But Mr. Miller\u2019s stubborn style of investing hurt him during the 2008 financial crisis, when he accumulated big positions in Bear Stearns, Freddie Mac, the American International Group and other struggling financial stocks.Although he recovered from these depths, the assets he managed at Legg Mason were of a considerably smaller size.In recent years, Legg Mason has branched out aggressively into E.T.F.\u2019s, investment vehicles that track an index or mimic a style of investing and that have attracted billions of dollars in investor money \u2014 much of which has come from underperforming, actively managed mutual funds.\u201cBill has been an important part of the growth and success of Legg Mason over the years and we appreciate his many contributions,\u201d Joseph A.

{"Headline": "The Obama Years: The Best of Times to Be a Stock Investor", "Date": "2016-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesPresident Obama hasn\u2019t boasted much about the performance of the stock market during his time in office, but if he were inclined, he could do so with gusto.The facts are inescapable: The Obama years have been among the best of times to be a stock investor, going all the way back to the dawn of the 20th century.Consider that had you been prescient enough to buy shares of a low-cost stock index fund on Mr. Obama\u2019s first inauguration day, on Jan. 20, 2009, you would now have tripled your money. Stock market performance of this level has rarely been surpassed.Yet this performance has not been as widely celebrated or appreciated as past bull markets have been, nor is it a major issue in this year\u2019s presidential campaigns. The main reason may simply be that the current bull market is suspect because it came after one of the worst declines in stock market history.\u201cPoliticians almost seem embarrassed to talk about the stock market,\u201d said Paul Hickey, co-founder of the Bespoke Investment Group. \u201cIt\u2019s not a popular thing right now. But when you look at it, the record of the market under Obama is kind of incredible.\u201dBuying stock wasn\u2019t the obvious thing to do when Mr. Obama took office. The United States was still in the grips of the most severe economic downturn since the Great Depression, and the Dow Jones industrial average had already declined 34 percent over the previous 12 months \u2014 and it was still dropping.Yet the market performance record is first-rate.I asked Mr. Hickey to run the historical numbers, and he found that since 1900, the Obama presidency has so far been the third best for stock investors. Using the Dow Jones industrial average, market performance has been better only during the presidencies of Calvin Coolidge, a Republican, in the Roaring \u201920s; and Bill Clinton, a Democrat, from 1993 to early 2001, years that encompassed the tech bubble.The market under President Obama has risen 11.8 percent, on an annualized basis, without dividends. That compares with 25.5 percent for President Coolidge and 15.9 percent for President Clinton. It exceeds the Dow\u2019s performance for everyone else, including three Republicans who were known for being pro-business and for tenures that coincided with strong stock markets: Ronald Reagan, with 11.3 percent; Dwight D. Eisenhower, with 10.4 percent; and George H. W. Bush, with 9.7 percent.It\u2019s also noteworthy that since 1900, the market has performed better under Democrats, with a 6.7 percent annualized gain for the Dow, compared with a 3 percent gain under Republicans. Is it reasonable to conclude that Democratic presidents are better for stock investing than Republicans are? Probably not, especially with party alignments and policy positions in an extreme state of flux this year; even if this were true in the past, it may not be so in 2016 or in the future.Furthermore, if the direct impact of presidential policy on the economy is debatable, the effects on the stock market are even less clear. It is certainly difficult to demonstrate a strong cause and effect. But Mr. Hickey gave it a try: \u201cDemocrats spread the money around more than Republicans do, stimulating consumer spending, which is good for the economy and for the stock market,\u201d he said, but that this connection is hard to quantify conclusively.That said, there are two obvious reasons for the market\u2019s stellar performance in the Obama years.One is simply that, from a stock market standpoint, Mr. Obama had fortuitous timing. The market and the economy were already in such bad shape by the time he arrived in office that any signs of recovery were likely to result in a market rebound. Stocks did relatively well during much of Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s tenure, for example, partly because they had done so badly during Herbert Hoover\u2019s presidency at the start of the Great Depression.The chairwoman of the Federal Reserve has begun the process of raising interest rates, a move that her predecessors have taken in recent decades as they put their own distinctive stamp on the economy.The financial market research firm\u2019s survey of presidential elections and the stock market since 1900 concludes that (even though voters tend to tire of two-term presidents and their political parties) the kind of market we\u2019ve seen this year is, if anything, auspicious for the incumbent Democratic Party. \u201cThe stock market action so far this year is very much aligning up to support an incumbent party retaining the White House,\u201d said Ed Clissold, chief United States strategist for Ned Davis Research and a co-author of the note.The economy, which isn\u2019t strong, is at least not in recession, he said, and the Fed\u2019s monetary policy is expansionary, while fiscal policy is looser than it was during Mr. Obama\u2019s first term, which was bedeviled by the \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d budget impasse. He also cited this year\u2019s stock market pattern, which includes a correction \u2014 a decline of a little more than 10 percent \u2014 that ended in February, along with a smart recovery. All of that helps to tilt the odds in favor of an incumbent party victory, he said. A major market decline before the election could shift matters, however.This kind of tea leaf reading implies that the stock market is affecting the country\u2019s mood and political alignment, even if it\u2019s not being widely recognized. Investors may not give the president any credit for their portfolio returns. But the numbers are straightforward enough, and for those fortunate enough to hold stock, they are heartening: It\u2019s been a splendid market.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Movement to Define Native American Cuisine", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by12 PhotosLAKE TRAVERSE INDIAN RESERVATION, N.D. \u2014 The moon was full and the chokecherries were ripe in the southeastern corner of North Dakota. \u201cIt\u2019s the one smell that shoots me back to being young,\u201d said Sean Sherman, as the berries boiled under a red-veined froth.Mr. Sherman has simmered corn silk with purple bergamot blossoms to make tea, and braised rabbit with spruce tips. He has revived chaga, the fungus that blooms on birch trees, in warm hazelnut milk, and burned juniper branches and corn cobs all the way down to a soft black ash.These techniques aren\u2019t borrowed from the cutting-edge kitchens of New York or Copenhagen. Mr. Sherman, a 42-year-old chef who is Oglala Lakota, draws from the knowledge of the Lakota and Ojibwe tribes who farmed and foraged on the plains of the Midwest.His work is part of a slowly gathering movement that he and other cooks are calling \u201cnew Native American cuisine,\u201d or \u201cindigenous cuisine\u201d \u2014 an effort to revitalize native food cultures in contemporary kitchens. Mr. Sherman, who has been cooking in restaurants for nearly 30 years and plans to open his own in Minneapolis next year, jokingly refers to his style as \u201cun-modernist-cuisine.\u201dBecause so many of the native food ways passed down through generations orally, they have been forgotten or obscured, and his quest has required a mix of trial-and-error, scholarly research and painstaking detective work. In some cases, Mr. Sherman has had to rely on his imagination to fill culinary gaps.\u201cHe\u2019s the second generation to do this work,\u201d said Lois Ellen Frank, a food historian with a catering company in Santa Fe, N.M. \u201cAnd he\u2019s following in our footsteps.\u201dWhen Ms. Frank began asking questions about Native American cuisine in the 1980s, she was told there was no such thing. \u201cBut of course they had a cuisine,\u201d said Ms. Frank, who now has a doctoral degree in culinary anthropology, \u201cand it was intricate, diverse and delicious.\u201dMr. Sherman explained how the precolonial food cultures that inspired his work were sophisticated, supported by complex trade routes and traditions. To piece together their techniques, he interviewed community elders and academics, and studied books like \u201cBuffalo Bird Woman\u2019s Garden,\u201d the farming practices of a woman who lived on the Fort Berthold Reservation in North Dakota at the beginning of the 20th century.He placed a stack of resources, about 20 books on ethnobotany and indigenous foods, at the front of the room, but the real work took place outdoors, where participants were asked to forage ingredients for dinner.Alex Jimerson, 27, a graduate student in the food-studies program at New York University, dug up burdock in the wild thickets between corn fields. \u201cThis holds so much more meaning for us than what people call Paleo,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause we can see the real diets of our ancestors, and we see how people lived in this region.\u201dYou don\u2019t have to forage for these staple ingredients, indigenous to the Upper Midwest.Mr. Jimerson, a member of the Seneca Nation, was excited to help prepare the five-course dinner that would end the retreat. He went foraging for tannic buffalo berries and wild greens early in the morning, before the sun rose high over the prairie and it became too hot to trek. He had never seen clumps of white sage growing wild, and he picked some.Later that night, he helped as the chef de cuisine, Brian Yazzie, used the sage leaves to quick-smoke duck.The duck would be served with dried cherries and a delicate cracker of puffed wild rice and amaranth, with the flavor of just-popped corn. Mr. Sherman also put walleye, the big glassy-eyed perch, on the dinner menu, with a maple and corn broth, and wrinkled dry apple slices that came to life with dabs of lemony sorrel pur\u00e9e.The dishes were typical of Mr. Sherman\u2019s style: colorful and elegant, with roots in fine dining and ancestral cooking, pulled together from a mix of cultivated and wild regional ingredients.They were also composed without wheat flour, sugar or dairy \u2014 the government-issued commodities that replaced many native foods on reservations more than a century ago. Mr. Sherman avoids them.This means he does not cook fry bread, the simple deep-fried dough familiar to every tribe in the country. Fry bread was born as a food of survival, developed by ingenious cooks who needed to make the most of flour and lard, and it later became the base of the Indian taco: fry bread under ground beef and toppings like shredded cheese and sour cream.He tried to imagine what the Indian taco might look like if wheat flour and dairy had not become a part of the native diet. Sure, the answer would vary all over the country, but in this part of the Midwest what made the most sense to Mr. Sherman was a kind of corn cake base, maybe seasoned with juniper ash, fried in a shallow depth of sunflower oil until the edges became brown and crisp.Instead of the usual toppings, Mr. Sherman piled on heirloom beans and lean bison meat braised with cedar fronds. He smoked turkey and tossed it with fried sage. For vegetarians, he worked with whatever was in season \u2014 beans and hominy one month, a variety of summer squash the next.He called this simple dish an indigenous taco. On the top, he sprinkled toasted sunflower, pumpkin and squash seeds and a berry sauce called wojapi, made from fruits like chokecherries, which Mr. Sherman has picked every summer since he was a boy.Mr. Sherman got his first shotgun when he was 7, took it down the hill at Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota and came home with some pheasant. It was the early 1980s, and his family\u2019s pantry was mostly stocked with government commodities: cereal, shortening and canned hash with the slippery texture of dog food, as Mr. Sherman remembers it.But his family was lucky: There was usually fresh beef from his grandfather\u2019s cattle ranch in the freezer, as well as rabbits, antelope and game birds. And in the summer, there were wild chokecherries.Mr. Sherman used to spread a sheet on the ground and pull as many loose as he could, bundling the cloth up to carry it home to his mother, who would put on a pot to make wojapi.Wearing a black T-shirt, his long brown hair tied back in a ponytail, Mr. Sherman boiled chokecherries until the pits sank to the bottom of the pot and could be easily removed. Over the course of the retreat, he would use the versatile fruit three ways. First, he made a big batch of wojapi, then a predinner tea, infused with wild hyssop leaves and sweetened with a little maple syrup. He even used it to dress salad leaves, sharpening it with sour wild sumac instead of lemon juice.Pine Ridge, where Mr. Sherman lived until he was 12, is one the country\u2019s largest reservations in size, and one of its most impoverished communities. \u201cMy family didn\u2019t have any money, so I started working as soon as I could,\u201d said Mr. Sherman, who helped in his mother\u2019s frame shop, and later had a paper route.At 13, Mr. Sherman got his first restaurant job washing dishes, and quickly moved onto the line, cooking in Minneapolis and farther afield, where he learned to skim French-style stocks and roll out Italian pastas. He came to know his way around wines from Sancerre and the Loire Valley.But Mr. Sherman\u2019s ambitions go beyond dinner service. He hopes his new restaurant can bring jobs into Native American communities, and start careers in the industry. He wants to create a larger demand for Native American-owned food businesses. (He already buys walleye from Red Lake Fishery, and the wild rice he uses is harvested by tribes who live around the lakes of Northern Minnesota.)In time, Mr. Sherman and Ms. Thompson plan to open a culinary center and school focused on indigenous food systems.Back in the retreat kitchen, it was time to pick up the pace. Mr. Sherman instructed one group of his attendants to roll minced rabbit meat in big purple amaranth leaves, and another to blanch prickly nettle so it would be easier to handle. Two people got to work slitting open milkweed pods to fry and scooping out the feathery white buds to garnish a salad; outside, Mr. Jimerson turned corn over flames.Bit by bit, a feast came together. \u201cWe\u2019re a small but tightly knit community,\u201d said Mr. Sherman, as the chokecherries swelled and fell away from their pits. \u201cBut we see the momentum growing.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the size of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. It is one of the country\u2019s largest in area, not the second largest.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Some Good News for Investors: The Bull May Still Have Spring in Its Step", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe bull market in stocks has been supported by two fundamental pillars: high corporate earnings and low interest rates. Both of these mainstays appeared wobbly early this year. Fortunately for investors, there is now some good news for both of them.Corporate earnings and cash flow, which had flagged, are stabilizing and perhaps rising, according to a stream of corporate reports released during the quarterly earnings season, which is nearing its end.Taken together, this information is hardly a guarantee that stocks will continue to rise or that current market levels will seem sensible years from now. But for investors, the interest rate and earnings environment has become friendly again, and without these buttresses, the outlook for stocks would be much gloomier.As he acknowledged, it\u2019s not entirely a rosy picture, and the numbers are complicated enough to make your head swim. On a year-to-year basis, for example, earnings in the second quarter are expected to have declined more than 2.2 percent for companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, according to a tally by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That\u2019s hardly cause for rejoicing.Exclude energy companies, however, and year-to-year earnings improved to a positive 2.3 percent growth rate. Moreover, Mr. Yardeni noted that compared with the level of the previous quarter, overall earnings for companies in the S.&P. 500 increased in the second quarter. And while the consensus of Wall Street analysts is that the current quarter\u2019s earnings will post another year-over-year decline, Mr. Yardeni expects that earnings will at least be no worse than they were in the previous quarter and will perhaps grow modestly.\u201cThe point is that earnings are much better than you might have expected, given the dollar, given what happened to energy and commodity prices, and given the slow growth of the global economy,\u201d he said.What\u2019s more, the cash generated by corporate America has allowed companies not only to pay reasonably handsome dividends but also to buy back large quantities of their own shares. These buybacks have strengthened the market: By reducing the number of shares, they have been making earnings per share look much better, and that should continue.But the simplest way of looking at it, he says, and the most important for an investor, is to consider how interest rates affect the value of a stock and a bond. \u201cLow rates have had a big effect on the stock market,\u201d he said. \u201cStock is much, much cheaper than bonds at today\u2019s interest rates.\u201dThis comparison may seem odd, if you\u2019re not accustomed to thinking this way. It works like this: For the S.&P. 500, the price-to-earnings ratio is about 20, which means that for every $100 worth of stock, you receive $5 in earnings. By comparison, a 10-year Treasury note, with a yield of 1.6 percent, pays out only $1.60 for a $100 investment. The bond has a price-to-earnings ratio of more than 60, meaning that it\u2019s more than three times as expensive as stock. If interest rates rose to, say, 10 percent, their rough level in 1979, he said, the price-to-earnings ratio of bonds would drop to 10: Current stock prices would look unreasonably high in that environment, he said.\u201cIn the world we live in right now,\u201d he said, \u201clow interest rates make stocks look very good, at least in comparison to bonds.\u201dThat\u2019s why the latest signals from the bond market, and the latest statements from the Federal Reserve, are so important for stock investors. They indicate that while rates are likely to rise moderately in the United States in the next year, they probably won\u2019t rise very much, and low rates will be with us for some time. Inflation is very low, growth is meager, and the economy is vulnerable to shocks.In her speech on Friday in Jackson Hole, Ms. Yellen acknowledged as much. If the economy continues to improve, she said, the Fed will raise its benchmark federal funds rate, as it has stated for many months. That rate is now between 0.25 and 0.5 percent. But she also emphasized that the central bank wasn\u2019t likely to raise rates very much.This raises complex problems for central bankers. For stock investors, though, it provides straightforward confirmation of a central assumption of the bull market: While there may be some short-term increases, low interest rates are likely to be here for some time to come.That\u2019s not entirely positive. If economic growth were stronger, inflation would probably be higher and interest rates would rise. Without strong growth, churning out robust corporate earnings will be a challenge. For now, though, the twin pillars of the stock market remain intact. That could keep the bull market in stocks, now in its eighth year, cavorting for a while longer.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

He is a co-founder of Tangible Utopia, a music collective that produced the documentary film shown at Espace Albatros.Mr. Decret\u2019s parents came to watch the documentary and told him the whole phenomenon had a hippie vibe, he said.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s this thing about coming together for real, sharing a moment,\u201d he said.So young and mostly middle-class Parisians banded together to establish informal collectives of musicians and other artistic types to perform regularly at venues in suburbs, with immigrant and working-class histories.\u201cThere\u2019s an adventurous side to going beyond the p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique to party,\u201d said Mr. Labb\u00e9, who manages public relations for the Zig Zag club in the Eighth Arrondissement of Paris, referring to the ring road that separates the French capital from its suburbs.Organizers of these suburban dance-music festivals have created a more open, free-spirited milieu than the exclusive \u2014 and expensive \u2014 club scene in Paris.\u201cIt\u2019s different,\u201d Armand Poulhen, a 24-year-old graduate student, said during a recent daytime party in Montreuil. \u201cPeople don\u2019t judge here,\u201d he added.The groovy beats, flashy lights and abundance of balloons contribute to the block-party vibe.The dance parties are held mostly on weekends, and many of the events during the spring and summer months are held outside and in the daytime. Entrance fees are usually less than the 20 euros, or about $22, that clubs in Paris charge, and some parties are free.The events on the outskirts of Paris draw young urbanites to neighborhoods they would not normally visit, and some partygoers say the sense of adventure is part of the appeal.At Espace Albatros, the arts center in Montreuil, Nicolas Boivin, a 24-year-old who works in advertising, said his curiosity about places outside the city had him on the lookout for parties in the suburbs, away from the Parisian \u201cstandard.\u201dOne arts center and occasional club, 6B, in a former industrial building in St.-Denis, north of Paris, draws well-heeled electronic music fans to a neighborhood where unemployment has been nearly 20 percent, twice the national rate.\u201cWalking out of the 6B, that\u2019s a slap in the face,\u201d said Benedetta Bertella, 31, half of a husband-and-wife D.J. team that tours parties in the suburbs. She describes homeless camps just outside some of the clubs where she plays, adding, \u201cYou think, damn, we\u2019re partying here.\u201dSome who live in the communities that host these dance parties view the Parisian partygoers as intruders.Several noise complaints were filed in 2015 with local authorities, and a few residents of L\u2019\u00cele-St.-Denis, across the Seine from 6B, filed an online complaint to the mayor and the owner of the arts center.On a blog hosted by residents, a neighbor identified as Eric complained about \u201cParisian partygoers who come ruining our nights because people elsewhere don\u2019t want their parties.\u201dBut others, like Mady Senga-Remou\u00e9, 35, who lives near 6B, said the changes were overwhelmingly perceived as having a positive influence on the neighborhood. The space, she emphasized, acted as a community center and encouraged activities.\u201cIt\u2019s like a hive,\u201d said Ms. Senga-Remou\u00e9, who added that she and some of the neighbors occasionally attended the parties.Sofiane Meza, 37, who runs a bar and tobacco shop in L\u2019\u00cele-St.-Denis, said the party scene brought a bourgeois-bohemian touch to the neighborhood.\u201cEvery time there\u2019s a party at the 6B, I end up with empty stocks of additive-free tobacco,\u201d he said with a smile, adding, \u201cIt makes for a few more clients.\u201dMr. Meza said the noise did not bother him.Leaning on the bar, Rachid Dendoume, a 48-year-old foreman living nearby, strongly disagreed. \u201cThere\u2019s no respect,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s noise pollution. There are too many noise issues here already.\u201dBut Mr. Dendoume said that the noise was the main issue and that he did not mind having Parisians partying in his neighborhood. \u201cIt brings a different population,\u201d he said.B\u00e9atrice N\u00e9h\u00e9mie, a private secretary to the mayor of St.-Denis, said not all activities offered by 6B attracted the same audience, with locals taking part in daily activities and workshops.The music played at parties may keep more locals from attending those events. \u201cIt\u2019s quite edgy,\u201d Ms. N\u00e9h\u00e9mie said. \u201cIt targets a specific audience.\u201dParties may now be added to the list. Though some residents complain, local officials see opportunities to put a more attractive face on their towns and have a diverse cultural agenda. A recent weekend of events in Bobigny, northwest of Paris, took place on city-owned land.The City of Paris, which tries to coordinate with adjacent municipalities, has tried to encourage the area\u2019s rise as a techno-music destination.In central Paris, parks are opening all night this summer.A Night Council, where bar and club owners meet with the authorities twice a year, has been started at City Hall.Its \u201cnight life counselor,\u201d Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Hocquard, sees it as part of his job to encourage the city to loosen up and have a little fun.\u201cThe City of Paris may not have developed or promoted its night life enough,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Everyone Despises SolarCity Deal, Except Tesla Shareholders", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseCorporate governance experts are up in arms, because Tesla\u2019s visionary founder, the entrepreneur Elon Musk, also founded SolarCity and is the largest shareholder in both companies. SolarCity\u2019s chief executive is Mr. Musk\u2019s cousin. There are overlapping directors. Critics called it blatant self-dealing and accused Mr. Musk of using valuable Tesla shares to bail out a struggling SolarCity.James S. Chanos \u2014 an investor who, it should be noted, is betting against both stocks \u2014 called it a \u201cshameful example of corporate governance at its worst.\u201dBut what if the critics are wrong?Many auto industry experts also said the idea of combining Tesla, an electric-car manufacturer, with SolarCity, which makes solar energy panels, makes no strategic sense. Even if energy generation, storage and an auto powertrain are a seamless product, so-called vertical integration, in which one manufacturer makes all the components, was the old Henry Ford model and later, General Motors\u2019. That approach has gone down in automotive history as a colossal failure.Adam Jonas, the influential auto industry analyst at Morgan Stanley, slashed his price target for Tesla and wrote in a note to clients that potential rewards would not adequately compensate investors for the greater risks and cash flow drain. Expanding into a non-auto business like solar energy exposes Tesla to \u201cuntested cost, competitive and regulatory forces,\u201d he warned.Perhaps the harshest verdict came from the market itself: Tesla shares dropped more than 10 percent the day the deal was announced.Mr. Musk \u201cwent overnight from being a genius to an idiot,\u201d said Joseph Dennison, portfolio manager at Zevenbergen Capital Investments, a large Tesla shareholder.Largely overlooked in the din, however, is that few, if any, of Tesla\u2019s harshest critics are Tesla\u2019s current shareholders. And they are the only ones who truly matter, because they\u2019ll have a vote on the deal and it\u2019s their money on the line.Tesla\u2019s four biggest shareholders after Mr. Musk are mutual fund managers, including the industry giants Fidelity, Vanguard and T. Rowe Price. None have announced how they\u2019ll vote, but they have a history of supporting management generally, and specifically Mr. Musk.Even before the deal was announced, a Fidelity portfolio manager, Gavin Baker, told investors, \u201cWe are fans not just of Tesla products but of the concepts underpinning the firm and potential future partnerships ahead of it.\u201dRonald Baron, founder of Baron Capital, which owns 1.5 million Tesla shares, said his initial reaction was, \u201cWhy on earth would anyone want to do this? Can\u2019t you buy these panels much cheaper in China?\u201dHe said he had looked into investing in SolarCity several times, and each time decided to pass (a wise decision considering that SolarCity shares have fallen more than 50 percent this year.)But after further research and discussions with Tesla management, Mr. Baron told me his concerns had been largely assuaged. \u201cUntil I read the proxy, I can\u2019t tell you how I\u2019m going to vote,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the more we researched this, the more sense it made to combine Tesla with solar panels. We believe they can make better products, make them more efficiently, and realize tremendous savings by selling the two products together.\u201dOther investors have also been reconsidering the merits of the deal. Tesla shares have more than recovered what they lost after the deal was announced. And investors brushed off an announcement on Wednesday of worse-than-expected quarterly losses, focusing instead on higher vehicle production and new orders.Tesla tried to do its best to allay concerns about Mr. Musk\u2019s conflict of interest. Mr. Musk will not vote, nor will other insiders who own shares in both companies, a step that was not mandated by law.Tesla maintains that various committees of directors that it says are independent vigorously negotiated terms of the deal, and that Mr. Musk did not know the price before it was agreed on. When the deal became final on Monday, the price was slightly lower than that announced in June, suggesting some genuine haggling went on.But realistically, Mr. Musk\u2019s dominant role in both companies means that \u201cit\u2019s an intractable problem,\u201d said Charles M. Elson, an expert in corporate governance at the University of Delaware. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to resolve this. The only way would be not to do it.\u201dTesla says that would elevate corporate governance purity at the expense of common sense. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to take every appropriate step\u201d to minimize the conflict issues, Todd A. Maron, Tesla\u2019s general counsel, told me this week. \u201cBut if there are synergies, which there are, and we can make the best product under one company\u2019s ownership, and we can persuade the independent shareholders to support the deal, there shouldn\u2019t be a strict prohibition just because someone is on both sides.\u201dMr. Dennison of Zevenbergen Capital said that focusing on conflicts \u201cis missing the bigger picture.\u201d\u201cTo make these future products as good, integrated and efficient as possible,\u201d he added, \u201cyou need the two companies working together.\u201d He said his firm had not announced how it would vote, but he has typically sided with management.From Zip2 to OpenAI, a look at the entrepreneur\u2019s many companies.As for making its own batteries and solar panels and being vertically integrated, Tesla maintains it had little choice. \u201cTesla does not believe in vertical integration as an objective in and of itself,\u201d Mr. Maron said, but \u201cgoes down that path because there\u2019s no better option.\u201d Tesla has said its planned auto production volume would consume \u201ctoday\u2019s entire worldwide production of lithium ion batteries.\u201d\u201cCreate a smoothly integrated and beautiful solar-roof-with-battery product that just works, empowering the individual as their own utility, and then scale that throughout the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t do this well if Tesla and SolarCity are different companies, which is why we need to combine and break down the barriers inherent to being separate companies.\u201dAdmittedly, that\u2019s a long-term vision that has little to do with the latest quarterly earnings. If Tesla owners were plugging their cars into outlets with electricity from coal-fired power plants, there would not be much sustainability to get excited about.\u201cMusk\u2019s vision from Day 1 10 years ago was to accelerate sustainable energy, \u201c said Mr. Dennison. \u201cThat\u2019s a much bigger vision than building cars.\u201dAnd vision is what Tesla\u2019s shareholders are buying into, just as Amazon investors put their faith in Jeff Bezos. That\u2019s why, for all the controversy, the SolarCity deal will almost surely be approved by Tesla shareholders.\u201cIf you\u2019re investing in a Musk business, you\u2019re investing in something that hasn\u2019t happened yet, so it\u2019s risky,\u201d said Mr. Baron. \u201cBut I love the guy. He\u2019s totally focused. He\u2019s already accomplished what people said could never be done.\u201dMr. Dennison agreed. \u201cYou\u2019re investing in the people who make and execute decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is obviously tied to a bigger picture and a longer-term road map than most. But Tesla management has executed on all the goals they\u2019ve laid out. I\u2019d say this is an investment based on faith, but not blind faith.\u201dThe Common Sense column on Aug. 5, about the proposed merger of Tesla Motors and SolarCity, described SolarCity\u2019s product incorrectly. The company makes solar energy generating panels, not storage devices.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Italian Banks Continue to Lend to Stagnant Companies as Debt Pile Mounts", "Date": "2016-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Italy, where two decades of economic stagnation have created a long line of barely breathing companies, Feltrinelli, one of the country\u2019s largest booksellers, stands out.Since 2012, the company has chalked up three consecutive years of losses totaling nearly 11 million euros ($12.4 million).Even so, late last year, Feltrinelli was able to secure a fresh \u20ac50 million line of credit from a syndicate that included two of Italy\u2019s largest banks, UniCredit and Intesa Sanpaolo, at an interest rate below what top-rated companies in Europe were paying.In recent weeks, Italian bank stocks, down 70 percent for the year, have rallied, buoyed by recent stress-test results and, for some, earnings that were better than expected.But with the International Monetary Fund estimating the size of Italy\u2019s bad loan pile to be \u20ac360 billion \u2014 or about a third of the total amount in the eurozone \u2014 economists contend that any improvement in the debt situation will be short-lived.At the heart of the problem, the research paper concludes, is a nexus of inert banks lending to inert companies that has kept a lid on the recovery of Italy\u2019s economy, the third largest among countries that use the euro. The bank-driven slowdown recalls the zombie lending cycle that Japan entered in the 1990s, leading to its own lost economic decade.Then, instead of biting the bullet and taking losses, large Japanese banks kept credit lines open to borrowers even when they had slight chance of making good on the loans.\u201cEurope has not learned anything from Japan \u2014 it has just repeated the same mistakes,\u201d said Tim Eisert, a German economist at Erasmus University in the Netherlands who participated in the study. \u201cMario Draghi may have saved the euro, but we still have undercapitalized banks in Europe.\u201dIn their report, the economists calculate that if European banks were subjected to a scrubbing similar to what United States banks experienced, they would need to raise \u20ac125 billion in new capital.At a time when investors across Europe have become deeply skeptical of investing in banks, and governments are loath to offer bailouts, achieving such a number borders on the impossible.Feltrinelli is just one example of a number of highly indebted Italian companies receiving loans at below-market interest rates over the last three years, a period when aggressive policies by the European Central Bank freed extra cash for European banks to dole out credit.Other companies cited in the paper include the clothing retailer Benetton, which has lost \u20ac240 million since 2012, yet also received a below-market-rate loan in that year, according to data collected by the economists.Massimiliano Tarantino, a public relations executive at Feltrinelli, said that the company had suffered during the recent crisis and was now shifting its strategy, making new investments in television, electronic publishing and book sales over the internet.In their paper, the researchers found that of the \u20ac540 billion in syndicated European Union loans that they tracked, 8 percent went to companies that they classified as zombie institutions.In Italy, however, the proportion of new loans that have gone to struggling companies like Feltrinelli over the last three years is much higher at 17 percent.In his speech, Mr. Stournaras said that 67 percent of the loans made to small and medium-size companies, the life blood of the Greek economy, were nonperforming, a statistic that explains in blunt terms why the Greek economy continues to stagnate.As with Greek banks, Italian banks are similarly exposed to small private companies, many of which have been hit hard by the sluggish economy.While such an amount, about 18 percent of total Italian loans outstanding, is certainly arresting, Italian government officials argue that sufficient steps have been taken to address the problem.They say that banks have set aside cash to cover nearly half of the loans and that all of the exposures are backed by sufficient collateral.They also point to the recent formation of a \u20ac4 billion fund that will buy some of the bad loans from the banks.Still, \u20ac4 billion does not rise to the level of a bazooka that would give the markets confidence. And as the I.M.F. report lays out, Italian banks are among the least profitable in Europe, which gives them little incentive to write off their loans, especially when there are tax incentives for bankers to not take such a step.Banks also have little incentive to pursue debtors in Italy\u2019s courts. The I.M.F. study says that liquidations of troubled Italian companies last, on average, eight years, with preferred creditors likely to claw back just 29 percent of their claim.So, instead of taking a hit, many Italian banks have decided to keep the liquidity flowing in the hope that a company might turn its fortunes around. But with growth averaging about 0.3 percent for the last two decades and now threatening to dip back into negative territory, a spate of corporate recoveries seems unlikely.And the lesson for global regulators is a powerful one, the economists involved in the study argue.Before using unconventional measures to inject cash into lending markets, central bankers must ensure that their large banks are sufficiently capitalized \u2014 as was the case in the United States, when one of the first steps regulators took was to force banks to increase their capital cushions. Without this extra layer of security, banks have little incentive to write down bad loans and focus on healthier companies.\u201cThese zombie loans are just bad for the economy,\u201d said Viral V. Acharya, one of the report\u2019s authors and a specialist in European debt at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business. \u201cThe problem is that Europe never injected capital into its banks like TARP in the U.S.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How the AK-47 and AR-15 Evolved Into Rifles of Choice for Mass Shootings", "Date": null, "News": "Time and again it\u2019s the same. A lone gunman or a small group of killers with rifles commits spectacular crimes that seize the attention of the world.The list reaches back decades: the killing of Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972; the school takeover in Beslan, Russia, in 2004; the attacks in Mumbai, India, in 2008; the mall assault in Nairobi, Kenya, in 2013; the killing of more than 100 people in Paris in 2015; the firing into a country music concert in Las Vegas in October 2017, which killed at least 58 people and wounded hundreds more in the most lethal mass shooting in modern American history; the premeditated Valentine\u2019s Day attack by a former student on a high school in Parkland, Fla.Often the rifles are variants of the AK-47, the world\u2019s most abundant firearm, an affordable and simple-to-use assault rifle of Soviet lineage that allows a few people to kill scores and menace hundreds, and fight head-to-head against modern soldiers and police forces.In recent years they have also been descendants of the AR-15, the American military\u2019s response to the Kalashnikov\u2019s spread. Semiautomatic versions of the AR-15 were used by sympathizers of the Islamic State in San Bernardino, Calif., in 2015, and by gunmen in school attacks; a Mini-14 and an MCX, rifles that fire the same cartridge as the AR-15 and compete with it for market share, were used in the mass shootings in Norway in 2011 and in Orlando, Fla., in June.The authorities said the gunman in Las Vegas used semiautomatic AR-15s, including at least one modified with a so-called \u201cbump stock\u201d to rapidly increase its rate of fire and kill 59 people and wound hundreds more. The FBI said the man who killed 11 worshippers in a synagogue in Pittsburgh fired on them with an AR-15. In the hands of terrorists, military-style rifles have repeatedly been used for swiftly killing on a large scale. How did the Kalashnikov \u2014 a disruptive technology that flooded the world almost three generations ago and still retains an outsize role in organized violence \u2014 become such a ready amplifier of evil and rage? In what ways did it drive the AR-15 and its competitors to such prominence, too?The AK-47, with an effective range beyond the length of a pair of football fields, was accepted in 1947. A few years later, a lighter and easier-to-manufacture update, the AKM, entered mass production in Russia, and was on its way to becoming the standard rifle for almost all Communist ground forces. The weapon soon left its mark.The Kalashnikov line was shorter and lighter than traditional rifles. It was inexpensive to manufacture, built for durability and reliable to an extraordinary degree. With few moving parts, and a design that made its disassembly and reassembly almost intuitive, its basics could be mastered by all manner of combatants \u2014 from traditionally instructed conscripts to almost wholly untrained guerrillas \u2014 in very little time.The cartridges were smaller than traditional rifle cartridges, which meant that a fighter with a Kalashnikov could carry more ammunition, and be more deadly, than riflemen of previous eras. The rifle\u2019s medium-power cartridges also meant the weapon had little recoil, allowing trainees to learn marksmanship at standard combat ranges with relative ease. These qualities contributed to the weapon\u2019s popularity among those who carried it; in much of the world the Kalashnikov became the everyman\u2019s gun.The Global Spread of KalashnikovsThe Kalashnikov\u2019s physical characteristics alone do not explain its prominence. It was the vast scale of rifle and ammunition manufacture in mammoth arms plants that drove the Kalashnikov to its status as one of the most immediately recognized products of the Communist era, one of the most readily identifiable objects in the world.The maps show the many ways in which it spread. Production began in the Soviet Union in the 1940s before expanding to the vassal states of the Warsaw Pact and to China, North Korea, Yugoslavia and beyond. Tens of millions of the rifles were churned out in planned economies, whether they were needed or not. In the U.S.S.R., where Kalashnikovs were cast as tools of the Motherland\u2019s defense, they entered the civic fabric. Students trained with them in schools.Ammunition plants were built in countries where the rifles were manufactured, ensuring ready supplies. More state forces adopted the weapons and began cartridge production, too. The rifle swept across much of the world. In the 1970s the Soviet Army introduced a new model, the AK-74, which fired a smaller, faster cartridge. Millions of older Kalashnikovs became officially obsolete, freeing them for global trade. Taken together, a series of industrial decisions in planned economies had created conditions for near ubiquity.Countries Wherethe Rifles HaveBeen MadeCountries WhereAmmunitionfor the RiflesHas Been MadeCountries WhoseMilitaries HaveUsed the Rifles asa Main WeaponCountries Where the Rifles Have Been MadeCountries Where Ammunition for the RiflesHas Been MadeCountries Whose Militaries Have Used theRifles as a Main WeaponSources: Armament Research Services, Conflict Armament Research, Igarap\u00e9 Institute, Peace Research Institute Oslo, Small Arms Survey.The rifles and ammunition were also manufactured in the former countries of Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Yugoslavia, which are not shown here.The spread changed modern warfare. As Communist governments passed Kalashnikovs to allies and proxies the rifles assumed an unexpected role: battlefield leveler.Vietnam offered the breakout. Africa had been colonized by small detachments of European soldiers turning machine guns against larger local forces that lacked access to equivalent weapons. In Vietnam, much of that advantage was gone. Guerrillas armed with Kalashnikovs fought toe-to-toe against foot soldiers of a superpower. Modern expeditionary units, facing automatic fire from inexpensive rifles carried by peasants, had met their close-quarters match. Often their ambitions were checked.The Kalashnikov\u2019s superiority to the American M-14 in jungle warfare in Vietnam spurred Robert S. McNamara, the defense secretary at the time, to push the Pentagon to hurry production of a new American assault rifle, the AR-15, which became known as the M-16. The decision would propel assault rifles to their current position as standard military firearms across the world.After its effectiveness was proved in Vietnam, the Kalashnikov assumed its indelible association as the terrorists\u2019 choice.Hostage-takers with Kalashnikovs scaled an Olympic Village fence in Munich in 1972 and seized members of the Israeli team. The rifle had broken its leash. It was no longer a tool of the state, or Communist ideology. The era of Kalashnikov terrorism had begun, with the world watching live on TV.Originally intended to strengthen authoritarian states, the Kalashnikov had gained outlaw credibility, morphing to a symbol of revolt, blowback, crime and jihad.The Kalashnikov\u2019s simplicity, compact size and gentle recoil combine to make it uncannily well-suited for child soldiers.In many wars commanders have provided the rifles to teenagers, and occasionally to combatants yet to reach their teenage years, who in spite of their small stature are able to manage the weapon and carry a large load of ammunition.Kalashnikovs are primary firearms for entire formations of child soldiers, including Joseph Kony\u2019s notorious Lord\u2019s Resistance Army in Africa, and the weapon is routinely used by children who augment rebel or irregular forces in wars around the world.The Islamic State, following the pattern, has made images of its child soldiers posing with Kalashnikovs part of its propaganda routine. They are not alone. Images of child soldiers with Kalashnikovs have been common in many conflicts for decades.Prone to jamming, the M-16 had a rushed and disastrous introduction in the Vietnam War. But most of its early flaws were worked out, and it secured its place in American armories. From there, NATO defense standardization prompted European services to field their own assault rifles, spreading this class of weapons across the non-Communist world.The Kalashnikov had fueled an unheralded arms race. By the 1980s the two lines of weapons \u2014 the AK-47 and the AR-15, and their many descendants and spinoffs \u2014 were a global pair.Laws in the United States mostly limited civilian possession of AR-15s and their competitors to models that fire semiautomatically only. But as these variants gained popularity with veterans, gun-rights advocates, preppers and, occasionally, with criminals or terrorists, their place in crime grew \u2014 even as Kalashnikov production ebbed. Variants of the AR-15 were used in the mass killings in a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., and at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, and by sympathizers of the Islamic State in San Bernardino. An MCX, a recently introduced military-style rifle designed for the Special Forces but available in semiautomatic form for civilians, was used by the lone gunman who attacked a nightclub in Orlando in June.The shooter in Las Vegas possessed civilian AR-15 models that had been retrofitted with inexpensive accessories, called bump stocks, that harness recoil to accelerate a semiautomatic rifle\u2019s rate of fire to rival those of automatic weapons. Semiautomatic Kalashnikovs are also part of the mass-shooting routine. The gunman in the 1989 schoolyard shooting in Stockton, Calif., which killed five children and wounded dozens more, attacked his victims with a semiautomatic Chinese Kalashnikov. His crime was part of the impetus for bans on assault-style weapons at the state and national level. The Army veteran who killed five police officers in Dallas in 2016 used a semiautomatic Kalashnikov. It had been made at the original AK-47 plant in Russia to be legal in the West and appeal to hunting and sporting markets.In the 1980s and 1990s, as Communism failed, the market economy welcomed Stalin\u2019s old goods. Successor governments continue to unload huge stockpiles, further flooding the world.Among the principal movers of Kalashnikovs has been the Pentagon, which bought them by untold thousands for proxy forces in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Pentagon also distributed tens of thousands of M-16s and the shorter M-4 carbine based on the AR-15 design, to the same forces. Many of these forces failed, yielding their rifles to bazaars or foes, making ever more weapons available on unregulated markets and for dangerous hands.Today the Kalashnikov and AR-15 variants remain the most commonly seen weapons on modern battlefields; their use is central to almost every war. They are a staple of insurgency and terrorism and all but fundamental to the grim routine of mass shootings. The Islamic State has killed far more people in Europe with bullets than with bombs, and controls territory in multiple countries in part through its military rifle stocks.Governments have done little to stop the spread of this class of weapons. Often, as in the case of the United States, they have contributed to it. Acts of crime, terror and oppression with Kalashnikovs and AR-15 descendants, endured by civilians under withering fire, have been hard-wired into our times.

{"Headline": "Mexico\u2019s Richest Man Confronts a New Foe: The State That Helped Make Him Rich", "Date": "2016-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 All is not well in the kingdom of Carlos Slim.For more than 25 years, he has dictated the terms of Mexico\u2019s telecommunications industry and built an empire, making him one of the world\u2019s richest men.But at home in Mexico, the game is changing. And there is not much he can do about it, analysts say.Determined to bring his dominance to an end, leaders from Mexico\u2019s three biggest political parties have put aside their own animosities in recent years, meeting in secret sessions to chip away at Mr. Slim\u2019s domain.Profits for Mr. Slim\u2019s flagship company, Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil, are in steep decline, falling 24 percent in 2015 and almost 44 percent in the first six months of this year, compared with the year-earlier periods. A closely watched metric of profitability on Wall Street has also fallen, and the company\u2019s stock has dropped by 39 percent in the past year.\u201cWhat has changed the most and is most relevant here is the authorities, and their attitude toward this empire,\u201d said Ernesto Piedras, the director general of the Competitive Intelligence Unit, a consulting and research firm. \u201cThis is the first time Slim does not have a copy of all the keys.\u201dRegulators in Mexico, sometimes against their government\u2019s wishes, had tried for decades to rein in Mr. Slim\u2019s dominance, finding themselves thwarted at every turn.But when the Institutional Revolutionary Party took back the presidency in 2012, it looked to reassert its power in a country where the state \u2014 not big businesses \u2014 has traditionally been king. And Mr. Slim offered a way to score political points at the same time: Mexicans were already openly scornful of what they called his expensive and often unreliable service.For Mexico, the telecom law offers a stark contrast to the state\u2019s many failed promises \u2014 to end corruption, enact the rule of law and bridge inequality. That the government has managed to take on Mr. Slim, arguably the country\u2019s most powerful citizen, is proof that where there is political will in Mexico, there is a way.\u201cThis administration invested in the economic reforms, but they ignored the reforms in the judicial system and in the field of corruption,\u201d said Enrique Krauze, a prominent Mexican historian who knows Mr. Slim.Still, the changes have done little to dent Mr. Slim\u2019s market share. He retains nearly 70 percent of the cellphone market and about 65 percent of fixed lines.In an interview, Mr. Slim said the new law established a certainty that all businessmen appreciate. But he bristled at the notion that his company required special regulation, or that it had stalled or impeded regulation in the past.\u201cLook at all the regulation they have imposed on us. Look at them!\u201d he said. \u201cEvery time they complain about something, they lobby to impose a regulation.\u201d\u201cThey thought they would come and bulldoze us, just because they are called AT&T,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the one hand, they say \u2018the biggest network in North America,\u2019 and on the other, they say that because they are small here we should subsidize them.\u201dThis year, Mexican regulators will determine if the new measures are enough to curb Mr. Slim\u2019s dominance. Regulators can crack down further if they decide Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil is not opening up to competition \u2014 by imposing large fines or even ordering its breakup.Overall, Mr. Slim appeared sanguine about his prospects.\u201cI have said it various times: Telecommunications are the nervous system of the new civilization,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to have a medium and long-term vision. You can\u2019t have quarterly visions.\u201dNot all analysts share his view.\u201cThe worst is not yet over,\u201d said Andre Baggio, an analyst at J.P.Morgan.Even before he became a household name in Mexico, Carlos Slim was a wealthy man. During the turmoil of the 1980s, a time of severe debt crises often called Mexico\u2019s lost decade, he had grown rich by snapping up bankrupt firms.As the country slid further into economic depression, Mr. Slim was the rare businessman with deep pockets. So President Carlos Salinas, under pressure in 1990 to sell off state-owned companies, dispatched a top official to gauge Mr. Slim\u2019s interest in buying the national phone company, Tel\u00e9fonos de M\u00e9xico.The pitch was straightforward: Whoever bought the company would receive a temporary monopoly. In exchange, the winner would have to invest billions in a company so decrepit that Mexicans never knew whether they would get a dial tone.Mr. Slim seemed skeptical. Still, he smelled opportunity.\u201cIf I enter and win, it\u2019s going to change my life,\u201d Jacques Rogozinski, the Mexican official in charge of the sale, recalled Mr. Slim saying.And so it did.There are many stories of Carlos Slim\u2019s rise: the son of Lebanese immigrants who inherited a family retail business and built an empire, piece by piece, down the long Latin American stretch of the Western Hemisphere. Those vast holdings include a significant number of shares in The New York Times.But there is another side, officials say \u2014 of tying up regulation in countless legal knots, of befriending the rich and powerful who identified his success with their own.This assertion enrages Mr. Slim, who denies stymying regulation. Ultimately, it comes down to customer choice, he said, in Mexico or anywhere else.\u201cYou can\u2019t, in a market of 110 million consumers, hold on unless people prefer to stay with you,\u201d he said.Shortly after winning the bid for Telmex, as the national phone company is called, Mr. Slim got to work improving service with his original partners, Southwestern Bell and France T\u00e9l\u00e9com, both of which later sold their stakes in the partnership. They installed millions of phone lines, and curtailed the common practice of repairmen asking for bribes.For years, the government left Mr. Slim to tend to the monopoly without interference. He was building something bigger than a company. As one of the first major emerging market stocks, Telmex was seen as a bellwether for an entire asset class on Wall Street. Hurt Telmex, the logic went, and you could hurt the market\u2019s perception of Mexico.But eventually, there was dissension in the ranks. Officials entrusted with policing competition in Mexico tried to rein him in. In 1997, the Mexican Federal Competition Commission ruled that Telmex was too powerful.Shortly before the ruling, the head of the commission, Fernando S\u00e1nchez Ugarte, got a call from a nervous senior official.\u201cThis will destroy the stock market,\u201d he recalled the official telling him.Mr. Slim\u2019s appeals of the ruling lasted a decade, until a judge decided in his favor. The regulators \u2014 outnumbered, outspent and trying to enforce weak laws \u2014 never stood much of a chance, former officials said.Regulators recall how Mr. Slim\u2019s lawyers would file into a conference room, wheeling large boxes of documents for routine meetings. At least once, the phalanx of lawyers was told to wait outside because the room was too small.\u201cThe story is not about Slim,\u201d said Robert K. Lacy, who was in charge of regulatory issues for Avantel, an early competitor to Telmex. \u201cThe government just buckled.\u201dMr. Slim said he never meant to tie up the system or compete unfairly. Rather, he said, when faced with an unjust fine or restriction, he simply fought back.Mr. Slim is often likened to Warren Buffett for his relatively low-key, avuncular style. He still lives in the modest home where he raised his children and drives himself around town, unlike many in Mexico\u2019s minted class.Years ago, on a visit to one of his ubiquitous Sanborns department stores, Mr. Slim spotted one of Mexico\u2019s most renowned poets, Homero Aridjis, reading a newspaper for sale in the store.Mr. Slim insisted he buy it.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t believe anything should be for free,\u201d said Mr. Aridjis, adding that Mr. Slim eventually backed down.Rather than hosting lavish spreads for meetings, Mr. Slim sometimes just orders in from Sanborns, whose aesthetic is reminiscent of an older generation of American diners.His reach extends far beyond Mexico, gained with an ability to time investments well and then exploit every opportunity to bolster them.He swept into Brazil in 2000, buying up cellphone companies to create a national one. He then fought a nearly decade-long lawsuit by the investment arm of Brazil\u2019s state-owned development bank, and waited patiently for lawmakers to let foreigners increase their control over pay television.It was classic Slim. Today, Brazil is Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil\u2019s largest subscriber market \u2014 larger even than Mexico.His strategy included building a close relationship with the president at the time, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who now faces obstruction charges in an enormous corruption probe. Mr. Slim has not been accused of any wrongdoing.It was not the first time Mr. Slim befriended a president. In Panama, he made fast friends with Mart\u00edn Torrijos, flying down for meetings, sharing dinners and even lending him a jet to attend the funeral of Pope John Paul II.Panama represented an opening, and Mr. Slim wanted in. After years of stagnation under the dictatorship of Manuel Noriega, Panama pinned its hopes on investment. Mr. Slim, in turn, saw a chance to expand his cellphone empire and win contracts for the expansion of the Panama Canal.He managed both, but Mr. Slim wanted more: a concession to build and operate a hydroelectric power station. There was one problem. The rights belonged to someone else, an entrepreneur named Julio C\u00e9sar Lisac, who had acquired 50-year concessions for two dams in 2005.Then, one day, a Mexican engineer paid Mr. Lisac a visit.The engineer worked for the Mexican state electric utility, whose chief executive was the brother of Mr. Slim\u2019s son-in-law. It was an odd visit. The Mexican state utility cannot build or finance projects outside Mexico. Mr. Lisac said it became clear that the real suitor was Mr. Slim.Eventually, representatives of an infrastructure company Mr. Slim controls made an offer. Mr. Lisac refused.\u201cSlim\u2019s no fool,\u201d he said. \u201cHe knew we had good dams in a good location.\u201dMr. Slim wound up with the project anyway. After missing a deadline, Mr. Lisac had the concession stripped from him in 2006. Less than two years later, it was awarded to Mr. Slim\u2019s company.Mr. Lisac fought in Panama\u2019s Supreme Court \u2014 and won \u2014 but regulators refused to enforce the order. By that time, 2010, Mr. Slim had already built the power station and was operating it.Mr. Lisac suspected that Mr. Slim\u2019s growing relationship with President Ricardo Martinelli, a supermarket magnate elected in 2009, could be at play. Mr. Slim and Mr. Martinelli maintained friendly relations, including attending the final New York Yankees game of the great Panamanian pitcher Mariano Rivera together.Refusing to give up, Mr. Lisac went before a World Bank court in 2013, but it rebuffed his challenge this June, calling it a domestic Panamanian dispute.Mr. Slim denied foul play, noting that he and his company had won the concession in a government auction.\u201cThe government of Panama has won this lawsuit; it\u2019s closed,\u201d Mr. Slim said.Mr. Slim has not always prevailed. In 2011, he paid a visit to regulators who had just won a decision in Mexico\u2019s Supreme Court that was about to cost him a lot of money.The ruling cut into an important income stream for Mr. Slim, forcing him to accept vastly reduced fees from other cellphone carriers for calls into his networks. He had fought the cuts for years, and told regulators they were making a mistake.But public opinion was turning against him.Mexico also lagged its Latin American peers in expanding mobile broadband service to all its citizens, falling behind Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and even Venezuela, according to 2014 figures from the Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development, a United Nations initiative.Mr. Slim is one of the commission\u2019s co-chairmen. Asked why rural stretches of his country have no cellphone reception, he cited regulators.\u201cThey began to insist that we have a lot of market share and that it was a reason to regulate us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe suspended investment in places where we would have 100 percent of the market\u201d because it would invite more regulation.Many Mexicans felt they were paying more for less, creating an opening for the new government. As Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto took office in 2012, a plan was hatched.The government and Mexico\u2019s three major parties met secretly, choosing different locations around Mexico City, often late at night, to avoid word leaking out until the legislation was almost ready.They also took aim at Mexico\u2019s two dominant television companies, which had been equally aggressive in protecting their market shares.Once a deal was reached, lawmakers enshrined the law in the Constitution to head off Mr. Slim\u2019s legal challenges, and set up special courts to rule on them.Those who know Mr. Slim say he has long anticipated the day when his control of Mexican telecom would diminish.\u201cHe knew this was coming,\u201d said James R. Jones, a former American ambassador to Mexico during the 1990s. \u201cAnd I suspect he was planning three moves ahead.\u201dWhile Mr. Slim\u2019s dominance \u2014 and profits \u2014 may be under threat in Mexico, his wealth no longer depends on it.\u201cHe began to invest in other things,\u201d said Juan Molinar, a former communications minister, in an interview before he died last year. \u201cFollow the money.\u201dAnd for years, the money has flowed elsewhere.In the United States, the results have been mixed. An investment in the retailer CompUSA was a failure, while a repaid $250 million loan to The New York Times made a handsome investment. He is now the company\u2019s largest shareholder (Mr. Slim holds Class A shares, which have limited voting rights).His companies build and lease offshore rigs, drill wells, operate dams in Panama and build gas pipelines in Mexico and the United States. He is even doing business with Halliburton\u2019s most famous alumnus, Dick Cheney, investing alongside the former vice president in WellAware, a Texas oil services software start-up.Mexico\u2019s $13 billion airport project has his fingerprints on it, too, including a son-in-law in partnership with the chief architect and another relative by marriage who served on the design committee.Though the committee member recused himself, the local news media saw what it often sees: \u201cThe New Mexico City Airport Will Have the Stamp of Carlos Slim,\u201d as one headline put it.Alejandra Xanic von Bertrab contributed reporting from Mexico City, and Paula Ram\u00f3n from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Self-Help Guru James Altucher Only Owns 15 Things", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cIf I were to die, my kids get this bag,\u201d Mr. Altucher said sardonically as he packed away his laptop, iPad, three sets of chinos, three T-shirts and a Ziploc bag filled with $4,000 worth of $2 bills (\u201cPeople always remember you if you tip with $2 bills,\u201d he said), and departed a friend\u2019s loft on East 20th Street.A few months ago, the boyish 48-year-old let the lease expire on his Cold Spring, N.Y., apartment, and dumped or donated virtually everything he owned, more than 40 garbage bags of sheets, dishes, clothes, books, his college diploma, even childhood photo albums. Since then, he\u2019s been bouncing among friends\u2019 apartments and Airbnb rentals.Mr. Altucher is simply practicing what he preaches. Over the last half-decade, this former tech entrepreneur, venture capitalist and financial pundit has reinvented himself as a gimlet-eyed self-help guru, preaching survival in an era when the American Dream \u2014 the gold-embossed college diploma, the corner office, the three-bedroom home \u2014 seems like a sham. So one by one, he has shed all of them.\u201cI have ambition,\u201d he said, \u201cto have no ambition.\u201d\u201cIn the past 25 years, income has gone down for the 18-to-35-year-olds, student loan debt is at an all-time high,\u201d Mr. Altucher said over a lunch of zucchini pancakes at a Russian restaurant in the Flatiron district. \u201cWe had $3 trillion in bailout money, and income inequality got higher than ever. People feel like they were scammed.\u201dMr. Altucher\u2019s diagnosis will come as no surprise to the anxious middle class, the downsized and the dispossessed who have propelled the angry populism of Bernie Sanders and Donald J. Trump.But while there is no shortage of anger and confusion about the supposed waning of the American Dream, what makes Mr. Altucher stand out are his Cassandra-like conclusions.Similarly, he believes homeownership is a rip-off foisted upon unwitting citizens by a $14 trillion mortgage industry.And he think stocks are a racket. It\u2019s a fierce worldview that is rooted in Mr. Altucher\u2019s own roller-coaster life.In the 1990s, as a young Silicon Alley start-up whiz, Mr. Altucher made millions with a web-design company, Reset Inc., that counted Sony and Miramax as clients.Soon, he and his wife at the time, Anne (they divorced in 2010), were living in a 5,000-square-foot loft in TriBeCa that he bought for $1.8 million and spent another $1 million renovating. He felt flush enough to take a helicopter to Atlantic City on weekends to play poker.The lavish lifestyle did not fill his emotional void. \u201cNobody should feel sorry for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI was really stupid, but I thought I was dirt poor. I felt like I needed $100 million to be happy. So I just started investing in all these other companies, and they were just stupid companies. Zero of these investments worked out.\u201dAs his fortunes collapsed, he was forced to sell his apartment for a $1 million loss (it was after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001).\u201cFinancial people were like watching a train wreck in real time,\u201d Mr. Altucher said. \u201cI had friends I hadn\u2019t talked to since high school call me and say, \u2018Hey, are you O.K.?\u2019\u201dHe soon discovered a sizable audience of people whose own dreams had just gone down the sinkhole. They, too, were looking to claw their way out.\u201cThe No. 1 search phrase on Google that takes people to my blog is \u2018I want to die,\u2019\u201d Mr. Altucher said.But Mr. Altucher seems like an unlikely person to look to for solace. Bookish, contrarian and given to speaking in staccato bursts, this skinny computer geek from North Brunswick, N.J., is like the anti-Anthony Robbins, the strapping self-help star.His regular-guy appearance turned out to be a plus, as he developed a following blogging about his win-some-lose-some \u201clife hacker\u201d experiments.It helped that Mr. Altucher, despite his biting views on topics like college, maintained a positive tone. \u201cI am an optimist,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a great novel from the \u201860s by Richard Fari\u00f1a called \u2018Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me.\u2019 Basically, I\u2019ve been down on the floor so many times, I know now that I can always bounce back, and it gets faster each time.\u201dHis philosophy is perhaps most clearly articulated in \u201cChoose Yourself,\u201d which he summarized over lunch like this: \u201cIf you don\u2019t choose the life you want to live, chances are, someone else is going to choose it for you. And the results are probably not going to be pretty.\u201dChapters include \u201cHow to Be Less Stupid\u201d (\u201cI lose at least 20 percent of my intelligence when I am resentful\u201d) and \u201cThe Seven Habits of Highly Effective Mediocre People\u201d (procrastination, he writes, \u201cis your body telling you that you need to back off a bit and think more about what you are doing\u201d).He calls them the four pillars of happiness. \u201cA chair needs four legs to be stable,\u201d he said.And there has never been a better time to choose yourself, he said.He would know. \u201cChoose Yourself,\u201d which Mr. Altucher self-published on Amazon, sold more than a half-million copies, he said, and made The Wall Street Journal\u2019s best-seller list.Mr. Altucher, in fact, disputes that he is a guru in the first place. \u201cI am not a self-help guy at all,\u201d he said.\u201cAdvice is autobiography,\u201d he added. \u201cI only say what has worked for me, and then others can choose to try it or not.\u201dBesides, what worked yesterday may not work tomorrow.\u201cIt\u2019s like Mike Tyson says,\u201d Mr. Altucher said. \u201c\u2018Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.\u2019\u201dAn article on Aug. 7 about the self-help guru James Altucher misstated the name of a website where people may learn basic web development.

{"Headline": "Trillions in Murky Investments Could Rock China\u2019s Economy", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 The deal could be hard to resist.There is just one catch: Investors know surprisingly little about what they are buying.The offering is just one of a spate of barely regulated, highly opaque investments that are posing a growing threat to the Chinese financial system. As the country\u2019s economy slows, experts increasingly worry that many of the investment funds could fail \u2014 and the government may not know how to handle the shock to its financial system.Over the last five years, Chinese investors have plowed at least $2.8 trillion into buying such funds from banks alone. After quintupling since 2011, these investments, known as wealth management products, now total an amount roughly equal to more than one-third of the country\u2019s annual economic output. Their growth has increased as China\u2019s economy has slowed.That is just the funds distributed by banks. Reliable data on wealth management products sold by other types of firms, like State Gold Treasure, is hard to come by.The problem for China is that a big chunk of the money is going into troubled industries like construction and real estate. Further slowdowns in those areas could result in major blowups.Banks also increasingly use the funds to raise money, instead of more stable deposits. The extra investment cash allows banks to make loans at a much faster clip than their deposits alone would allow. But if investors suddenly demanded their money back, banks could be in a financial bind.The Chinese government so far has stepped in to stop big meltdowns of wealth management products, to avert ripple effects and forestall investor anger. But not all investors have been spared.Li Wenyuan, a doctor in Beijing, says she invested almost $140,000 last year in a wealth management product linked to a steel company. After the company ran into difficulty, she was repaid less than $2,000. She had planned to use the entire original amount to send her son to a high school in Canada, where the air is cleaner and he would have a chance to improve his English.\u201cIt\u2019s quite a big loss for my family,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are still able to provide for ourselves. Still, it\u2019s a lot of money and I doubt I will ever get it back. I am worried.\u201dWealth management products are part of a huge but shadowy system of unregulated investments and underground banks that many Chinese people depend on for the loans that keep their businesses humming. Increasingly, the debate inside and outside China is focusing on what will happen if that system falls apart \u2014 and how quickly the government might be able to respond.China\u2019s wealth management products are neither stocks nor bonds nor mutual funds. A typical wealth management product offers a fixed rate of return over a set period. Many Chinese investors treat them like bank savings deposits because many are sold by state-controlled banks that give the funds the appearance of government backing.Among the biggest issuers of wealth management products are hundreds of banks and other financial institutions in poor, inland provinces. These banks are under intense pressure from provincial political bosses to keep lending and help sustain big employers like state-owned enterprises, at a time when the entire country\u2019s economy is slowing.To raise money for large-scale lending, banks have ramped up issuance. They sold 187,000 separate wealth management products by the end of last year, up 56 percent from a year earlier, according to official statistics.Technology has made it easier for firms other than banks, like State Gold Treasure, to sell the products online and through smartphone apps. \u201cIn the past, you\u2019d need to go to the bank to open an account or open an account at a certain fund company,\u201d said He Zhirui, a finance company worker in Beijing who also invests in wealth management products. \u201cNow, with the apps, you can simply upload your personal ID and purchase wealth management products right away online.\u201dChina\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.But the fund does not say who is guaranteeing the funds. The company declined interview requests and to make officials available for comment during a visit to its offices.The proliferation of wealth management products has drawn concern from regulators. In May, China\u2019s banking commission warned that the business was plagued with problems, including unauthorized products.Regulators are also considering new oversight rules. The goal, the commission said in response to questions, was to \u201cfacilitate a standards-based, healthy and sustainable development\u201d and to \u201cprevent risks.\u201dBut smaller banks combined are now almost as large as the four main banks combined. Wealth management products account for up to a third of money raised at many midsize and smaller banks.Mr. Li, the central bank adviser, and other officials and economists say the Chinese government has the resources to cover big losses if wealth management products fail. They also say China\u2019s increasingly tough enforcement of limits on sending money abroad will ensure that enough cash remains in the country in the event of a big failure.But some specialists in Chinese finance say that serious problems could appear faster than expected. They could also lurk in unexpected corners unnoticed by Chinese regulators, much less international investors.Owen Guo contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

Right now there is an overwhelming case for more government borrowing.Let me walk through this case, then address some of the usual objections.And this analysis doesn\u2019t even take into account the potential role of public investment in job creation: Despite a low headline unemployment rate, the U.S. economy is still probably short of full employment, and an investment agenda would also offer valuable insurance against possible future downturns.So why aren\u2019t we borrowing and investing? Here are some of the usual objections, and why they\u2019re wrong.There is, in short, an overwhelming policy case for federal borrowing to pay for public investment. But will the next president be able to act on this case?The good news is that elite discourse seems, finally, to be moving in the right direction. Five years ago the Beltway crowd was fixated on debt and deficits as the great evils. Today, not so much.The bad news is that even if Hillary Clinton wins, she may well face the same kind of scorched-earth Republican opposition President Obama faced from day one. So it matters not just who wins in November, but by how much.

{"Headline": "Treasury Wants to End Tax Deal for Some Family-Owned Businesses", "Date": "2016-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersThe Treasury Department has moved a step closer to tightening the way family limited partnerships are valued for tax purposes. And the prospect that the tax code could be changed by the end of this year has tax planners pushing their clients to consider stepping up estate and business planning, or risk paying more taxes.Earlier this month, the Treasury Department issued \u201cproposed final regulations\u201d to eliminate a provision in the tax code that effectively allows wealthy people to greatly discount the value of shares in a family limited partnership given to family members. These partnerships are able to own assets like family business, real estate and securities.The discount, which has been allowed since the 1990s, is granted for what is considered a lack of marketability for minority shares in these partnerships. If a family member, for example, wanted to sell his or her share in a partnership that was entirely owned by other family members, the pool of buyers might well be limited to his or her relatives. They might not have the money \u2014 or desire \u2014 to buy him out.This provision, contained in section 2704 of the Internal Revenue Code, has been abused by aggressive tax planners and lawyers who used the discount, sometimes as high as 40 percent, and applied it to partnerships that contained marketable securities or other assets that could otherwise be easily valued and sold.The Internal Revenue Service has repeatedly balked at stocks and bonds being discounted just because they were owned in a family partnership. On Dec. 1, it will hold a hearing on the new regulations, which would strip away the discount from all family limited partnerships regardless of what they hold.And this is one of the sticking points for planners. Many argue that partnerships that hold businesses should still be entitled to the discounts.\u201cThere have been abuses in the past, like when families took a $100 million of marketable securities and wrapped them in a family limited partnership wrapper and took a discount,\u201d said Christopher Pegg, regional wealth planning manager for Southern California at Wells Fargo Private Bank.\u201cBut what happens if it\u2019s a $100 million corrugated steel company and the family owns it and Mom dies with a 20 percent stake?\u201d he added. \u201cThe new regulations say that stake is worth $20 million. That\u2019s not what it\u2019s worth.\u201dMr. Pegg pointed out that if nonfamily members owned the same private company, the I.R.S. would allow a discount for the very same lack of marketability.\u201cWe cannot assume that one family acts together,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s worse in many cases being in with family than with strangers.\u201dTax experts do not rule out that these new regulations, although labeled final, could be changed in the comment period. Their enactment, which is set for 30 days after they become final, could also be delayed. At the earliest they would take effect on Dec. 31.Still, predicting when the regulations will take effect is beyond people\u2019s control and could be risky for those who would benefit from a family partnership.\u201cThere is no mulligan,\u201d said Mark Parthemer, senior fiduciary counsel at Bessemer Trust. \u201cIf a family is considering doing some tax planning and they\u2019re putting it off to next year, they can\u2019t go back in time and take advantage of the discounts.\u201dSome planners are drawing parallels to the fourth quarter of 2012, when wealthy people scrambled to make gifts under what was then a $5.12 million exemption for individuals. The rush was generated by the fear that the Obama administration would abolish or greatly reduce the exemption in 2013. Instead, the government kept it in place, with an annual increase for inflation.For the very wealthy, there is good reason to set up a family limited partnership by the end of the year. The discounting, for example, can turn a $10 million gift into $6.5 million for tax purposes.If the proposed changes go into effect as planned, they will certainly have an effect on certain very wealthy families. \u201cWe\u2019re telling clients to move quickly,\u201d Mr. Pegg said. He said that it typically takes six months to set up a family limited partnership, but if families were motivated and focused on this they could set one up in about 45 days.(Mark Williamson, a partner leading the wealth planning practice at the law firm Alston & Bird, said people who have already given shares in family limited partnerships at steep discounts are protected, as long as they filed the proper gift tax forms and the three-year statute of limitations on audits has passed.)But even if discounting goes away, the ability to save on tax, protect assets from creditors and pass any future appreciation on to the next generation still exists through tax planning.\u201cValuation discounts have always been the icing on the cake for these tax transfers that we do,\u201d said Scott Goldberger, estate and trust principal at the accounting firm Kaufman Rossin in Boca Raton, Fla. \u201cIf the primary goal is to push future appreciation of the business onto family members, thereby reducing the value of the taxable estate, the discount gives you a head start.\u201dApart from the discount, there are two effective strategies to move money or business interests to heirs.The first is simply getting assets that are going to appreciate out of a person\u2019s estate. If the gift is over the exemption amount, the person may have to pay gift tax. But after that, all future appreciation will grow outside of his or her estate.The second is to put those assets into what is called a grantor trust, which benefits future recipients by allowing the person making the gift to pay all the income taxes in the trust.\u201cThose two in tandem will typically outweigh the tax savings you\u2019d get from a discount,\u201d Mr. Goldberger said. \u201cEven after these regulations are finalized, we think we\u2019ll still be seeing a lot of our clients doing this type of planning.\u201dSeth R. Kaplan, a shareholder with the law firm Gunster, said he recommends some type of family entity for any family with more than $10 million in assets.\u201cThere are multiple tax as well as nontax benefits to this, like creditor protection,\u201d he said. \u201cIt lays the foundation for other planning, like charitable planning. It achieves some of the goals of centralized management. It can be given to other family members.\u201dAnd it is that desire for control and protection of the assets that planners say may be the most valuable benefit. If someone is sued, the assets inside the partnership are viewed as separate from the individual\u2019s assets, just as they would be in a well-crafted trust.That partnership structure also gives the family the ability to bind family interests together. This may not always be what beneficiaries want, but it is meant to ensure that a family business has the best chance of continuing.\u201cThere are many elements to intrafamily planning,\u201d Mr. Kaplan said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the world if it\u201d \u2014 the discount \u2014 \u201cgoes away.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the surname of a principal at Kaufman Rossin in Boca Raton, Fla. He is Scott Goldberger, not Goldberg. The article also referred incorrectly to Kaufman Rossin. It is an accounting firm, not a law firm.Advertisement"}

It is, instead, about Republicans \u2014 probably a minority within the party, but a substantial one \u2014 who aren\u2019t like that. These are people who aren\u2019t racists, respect patriots even if they\u2019re Muslim, believe that America should honor its international commitments, and in general sound like normal members of a normal political party.Yet the great majority of these not-crazy Republicans are still supporting Mr. Trump for president. And we have a right to ask why.True, a Clinton victory would mean a continuation of the center-left governance we\u2019ve had under Barack Obama, which would be a big disappointment for those who want a turn to the right. And many people have convinced themselves that ideology aside, Mrs. Clinton would be a bad president. Obviously I disagree on the ideology, and while we won\u2019t know about a Clinton presidency until or unless it happens, I find much to admire in the real Hillary, who is nothing like the caricature. But never mind: even if you\u2019re a conservative who really dislikes the Democratic candidate, how can you justify choosing Donald Trump?Put it this way: Is there any reason to believe that a Clinton victory would lead to irretrievable disaster? Because that\u2019s the question you should be asking yourself.Most important of all is the question of democracy at home.I know, conservatives like to complain that Mr. Obama has overstepped his authority by, say, using administrative discretion to delay some provisions of the Affordable Care Act. But let\u2019s be serious: no non-crazy person, even on the right, thinks that this president is acting like a dictator, or that the woman he wants to succeed him would threaten basic liberty. On the other side, anyone watching her opponent has to be very, very worried about his authoritarian streak.The bottom line is that even if you don\u2019t like Mrs. Clinton or what she stands for, it\u2019s hard to see how you could view her possible victory with horror. And it\u2019s hard to see how you could view Mr. Trump\u2019s possible victory any other way.How, then, can rational Republicans justify supporting Mr. Trump, or even remaining neutral, which is in effect giving him half a vote?For rank-and-file Republicans, it\u2019s presumably about feelings. Having spent so many years denouncing Democrats in general and Mrs. Clinton in particular, they have a hard time admitting that someone else could be much, much worse. But democracy isn\u2019t about making a statement, it\u2019s about exercising responsibility. And indulging your feelings at a time like this amounts to dereliction of your duty as a citizen.And whatever one may say about ordinary voters, the real sinners here are Republican leaders \u2014 people like Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell \u2014 who are actively supporting a candidate they know poses a danger to the nation.It\u2019s not hard to see why they\u2019re doing this. Opposing their party\u2019s nominee, no matter how awful he is, would probably end up being a career killer.But there are times when you\u2019re supposed to put such considerations aside. The willingness of some people who know better to support Donald Trump is understandable; it\u2019s also despicable.Advertisement"}

The company, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, also earned more money from vendors, who pay to sell and advertise their goods on its sites.The company said sales rose 59 percent in the first quarter to $4.8 billion. Its operating profit rose 71 percent to $1.3 billion.For many American investors, Alibaba is seen as a proxy for the health of the Chinese economy and the strength of its consumers. The company has outperformed the broader retail market in China. It has also been investing in the growth of e-commerce in the country \u2014 focusing on logistics and on rural areas where fewer people are online \u2014 so it can continue to grow even as the country\u2019s economy slows.The company is also working hard to brace itself for a further slowdown in China, pushing out of its conventional online shopping business into cloud computing, entertainment through online video and gaming, and even a food delivery business. Those long-term efforts have had mixed results. Results this quarter, for instance, showed that the company\u2019s smartphone-based food delivery business, Koubei, continued to burn cash competing with rivals.Yet other sectors have been more promising. Alibaba\u2019s cloud computing service, which is similar to the one offered by Amazon, has quickly gained traction in China, where businesses have been relying on Alibaba for computing power.Alibaba\u2019s gross merchandise volume, a closely watched measure of the transactions on the company\u2019s websites, grew 24 percent compared with the same period a year earlier, about the same pace as the prior quarter.Investors bid Alibaba\u2019s shares up more than 2 percent in premarket trading on the results.The underlying assumption that slowing growth in China will eventually hurt Alibaba\u2019s sales has focused more attention on its other businesses. During its recent investor day, Alibaba said it would start to offer more information on its efforts in sectors like entertainment and food delivery.\u201cWe have already started to see early signs of business breakthroughs in new categories and some of its burgeoning growth assets,\u201d Evan Zhou, a Credit Suisse analyst, wrote in a recent report.Yet those new breakthroughs come with risk. In the cloud computing sector, Alibaba has to contend with foreign rivals, and it faces a domestic challenge from the search engine Baidu. Its food delivery business risks becoming a drain on earnings, as many similar companies fight to gain customers by offering big commissions to drivers.Alibaba has also recently increased its focus on international expansion. While much of its efforts are centered on bringing foreign vendors to sell to Chinese consumers \u2014 and in turn spending marketing dollars on Alibaba\u2019s platforms \u2014 the company has also made bets on e-commerce in neighboring developing markets.The company invested in the Indian commerce companies Paytm and Snapdeal, and this year, it made its largest overseas acquisition, paying $1 billion to take over Lazada, a popular Southeast Asian shopping website.videoAdvertisement"}

He pleaded not guilty.The district attorney\u2019s office contends that Mr. Scahill also falsely claimed to have lined up a Shubert theater \u2014 the Booth, he said \u2014 and to have contracted with Netflix to make and distribute a filmed recording of the show, which he referred to as the \u201cKB project.\u201dMr. Scahill\u2019s lawyer, James R.

He\u2019s therefore entitled to the presumption of innocence, and he should receive that.\u201dMr. Scahill graduated from Cornell University in 1997, according to Mr. DeVita. He worked for the William Morris Agency until 2008, according to a spokeswoman for William Morris Endeavor Entertainment, the company formed in 2009 when William Morris merged with Endeavor. He was then employed by the Gersh Agency for 18 months until he \u201cwas terminated\u201d in the summer of 2010, according to Erik Bright, a spokesman for that company.Most of the victims were close friends of Mr. Scahill, according to court documents filed by the prosecutor.

Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and other banks want the Federal Reserve to give them until 2022 to offload investments banned by the Volcker Rule. They have already had six years to do so, during which time the stock market has doubled. Asking for such a long delay may lead to unwanted consequences.The request may have its merits. Many of the holdings are harder to get rid of than run-of-the-mill stocks and bonds. They also may be subject to contractual obligations that limit how and when they can be sold. And there is a chance that next summer\u2019s deadline might force banks to accept discounted prices.That is a concern for shareholders, however, not regulators. The $7 billion of affected investments at Goldman and the $3.2 billion at Morgan Stanley would hurt earnings if sold at a loss, but should not put a strain on capital.The broader issue is that banks have had plenty of time to get their houses in order. The Volcker Rule was part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank legislation aimed at reducing risks banks pose to the financial system. Although it did not take effect for another few years, most institutions quickly closed other affected units, such as proprietary trading.Further delays will come off as banks again trying to avoid rules and oversight. They already have the likes of Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders pushing for breakups and both political parties talking about reinstating the Depression-era Glass-Steagall law that separated commercial and investment banking.

{"Headline": "In Tesla and SolarCity Deal, a Glimpse of Musk\u2019s Clean-Energy Aspirations", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the face of questions about debt, widening losses, governance and strategic logic, Tesla Motors and SolarCity announced a $2.6 billion stock merger on Monday.Now, it is up to Elon Musk to persuade the shareholders of the two companies \u2014 he founded both \u2014 that the deal makes sense. The transaction requires the approval this year of a majority of shareholders from both Tesla and SolarCity, excluding Mr. Musk and other insiders.Completion of the deal may come down to whether enough investors have the patience to accept the near-term headaches while waiting for Mr. Musk\u2019s long-term vision.His idea is that Tesla\u2019s batteries could store the power that SolarCity\u2019s panels have harnessed, a bet on the increasing use of solar energy. Most analysts, though, say this vision could take years, maybe even decades, to play out on a large scale \u2014 often longer than many investors tend to wait.\u201cI don\u2019t know why people would be voting in favor of it,\u201d said Efraim Levy, chief automotive analyst at Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Market Intelligence. \u201cThe valuation is excessive given the current prospects and the time horizon we\u2019re looking at.\u201dBut Mr. Musk, who also founded a third company with the hope of sending humans to Mars one day, is known for his visionary zeal. By doing this deal, he sees Tesla eventually moving beyond autos to become more of a clean-energy company that also happens to sell cars.\u201cThis is really all part of solving the sustainable-energy problem,\u201d Mr. Musk said in a conference call with analysts on Monday. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re all doing this \u2014 is to try to accelerate the advent of a sustainable-energy world.\u201dFrom Zip2 to OpenAI, a look at the entrepreneur\u2019s many companies.The stocks traded on Monday as if most investors expected the deal would get done. Under the terms of the deal, SolarCity shareholders will receive 0.11 Tesla shares for each SolarCity share they own. That represents $25.30 per SolarCity share, or about 58 cents under where the shares ended trading on Monday.Subsequently, independent members of the Tesla and SolarCity boards conducted due diligence and consulted with financial and legal advisers to arrive at the agreed-upon price.Tesla, which will report its second-quarter earnings on Wednesday, is going through a major transition as a car company. It is expanding its assembly plant in California, in hopes of beginning to fill the more than 300,000 preorders for its coming Model 3 sedan by next year. To speed the process, Mr. Musk has overhauled his manufacturing team, bringing in new executives from rival automakers such as Audi.Tesla is also facing more pressure from federal regulators and Congress about its Autopilot assisted-driving system, which was operational in a Model S that crashed into the side of a tractor-trailer in Florida on May 7. The driver, Joshua Brown, was killed in the accident \u2014 the first known fatality in a vehicle being driven by computer technology.Tesla has until late August to respond to a set of detailed questions from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration about the accident, as well any others involving the Autopilot system, which includes assisted steering, adaptive cruise control, collision avoidance and emergency braking.The National Transportation Safety Board and the Senate Commerce Committee are also investigating the incident.The safety investigations may not directly affect the approval process for the proposed merger. But they could be seen as setbacks in Tesla\u2019s grand expansion strategy, and a distraction for Mr. Musk as he tries to win over investors.Monday\u2019s deal includes a so-called go-shop period, which enables SolarCity to continue soliciting proposals from other parties until Sept. 14.The two companies plan to cut about $150 million in costs through the transaction in the first full year after the deal closes. They expect customers to benefit through lower hardware and installation costs, and they plan to use Tesla\u2019s 190 stores to expand SolarCity\u2019s reach.Through Tesla\u2019s stores, SolarCity would get easier, cheaper access to millions of customers; SolarCity has struggled to reduce its customer acquisition costs. In addition, it could benefit from the carmaker\u2019s expertise in manufacturing, just as SolarCity prepares to produce its own solar panels at a heavily subsidized factory in Buffalo.Mr. Rive, of SolarCity, said in the conference call that he expected almost all solar systems to include battery storage within three to five years, and that the combined company would be able to prosper by providing those systems, along with energy services for the grid. Adding rooftop solar to the overall energy mix, Mr. Musk said, would allow utility companies to avoid building new substations and transmission lines as the rising use of electric vehicles and heating systems increases demand for power.The merger, he said, would help Tesla take better advantage of all the customers it attracts to its stores by offering them more products. Making the solar systems appealing, he said, was important.Although some investors have expressed support for the deal, many analysts and investors have continued to question whether it makes sense for the carmaker to take on SolarCity, which has piled on debt as it seeks to continue its aggressive expansion. Last month, SolarCity said it had raised $345 million in tax-equity financing and added $110 million to a loan agreement, bringing its total to $760 million.And on Monday, SolarCity reduced projections for residential system installations for 2016 by nearly 10 percent because the pace of installations had been slower than expected in the first half of the year.Many analysts are still optimistic that, despite the risks, the deal will ultimately get done.\u201cEverything about Elon is for the long term,\u201d said David Whiston, an analyst with Morningstar. \u201cI suspect the big, institutional shareholders understand that and they\u2019re all in on Elon, and I expect the large shareholders will vote yes for the deal.\u201dDiane Cardwell contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trying to Turn Back the Clock on Deals Gone Sour", "Date": "2016-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDeal ProfessorLyondell Chemical and Basell AF completed their merger nearly nine years ago. Yet today, former shareholders of Lyondell face the possibility that a new court ruling could force them to pay back money \u2014 all $12.5 billion of it.Several such clawback cases over buyouts that were hammered out in the years before the financial crisis but later failed have resulted in thousands of shareholders now fighting to keep the money that was paid out to them.It had seemed so different at the time. In July 2007, with the merger market still a bit bubbly, the more than $20 billion leveraged buyout of Lyondell was announced. Basell borrowed the entire purchase price to create the third-largest chemical company in the world, paying $12.5 billion to shareholders and the rest in fees and debt refinancing.But the chemical industry soon spun into a decline, and in the financial crisis the combined company could simply not shoulder its debt. LyondellBasell entered bankruptcy in January 2009, only 13 months after the purchase was completed.With all that money at stake, the bankruptcy proceedings have been bitterly fought with the bankruptcy trustee \u2014 the person appointed to oversee the debtor\u2019s estate \u2014 pursuing everyone in sight.Not content with big fish, the bankruptcy trustee turned on Lyondell\u2019s old shareholders.In three lawsuits, the trustee argued that the sale of Lyondell was a fraudulent transfer. Dating to England in the 1500s, this is a principle that tries to prevent a debtor from simply transferring their assets to avoid payment of a debt. In its various forms, the doctrine voids transfers made with the intent to defraud creditors like the banks and others who lent over $20 billion to finance this debacle.The doctrine has had a rebirth in the wake of the financial crisis, with a particular vengeance for leveraged buyouts. In the years before the financial crisis, private equity was king, accounting for over 20 percent of takeovers. Debt was piled onto companies, as was the case with Lyondell, which was financed entirely with debt.This debt became an enormous dead weight in the wake of the financial crisis, dragging companies down as they struggled to keep up with payments. More than a few went bankrupt.In the bankruptcy cases that followed, claims of fraudulent transfer were sometimes brought, most prominently in the bankruptcy of the Tribune Company, which had been bought by Sam Zell in an $8.2 billion buyout.Such claims have come as a bombshell to the former shareholders of these companies. They thought the deal was long done. The money was paid out, and shareholders reinvested it in new stocks or perhaps a new kitchen. But like a ghost from the past, a bankruptcy trustee knocks on the door years later, demanding repayment.Even if the trustee does not succeed, the shareholders face legal costs to try and prevent repayment. In the Lyondell case, the trustee sued shareholders who received more than $100,000. He then included everyone, down to a grandparent in Florida who owned 10 shares. And in a lawsuit you need to hire a lawyer.The plaintiffs claimed that there was actual intent here as a result of the actions of Lyondell\u2019s chief executive at the time, Dan F. Smith. In the hasty negotiations of the Basell deal that unfolded in a week, Mr. Smith was accused of updating projections that the plaintiffs said were overly optimistic.But that is not enough \u2014 the plaintiffs had to show intent. Here the chief executive was harmed by some language he had used before the buyout. At a convention in Las Vegas two months before the deal with Basell, Mr. Smith said, \u201cIf you\u2019re a bondholder, I am not sure you get enriched\u201d in a buyout of Lyondell. He continued, \u201cIf you think you are going to have a down cycle in the chemical markets, don\u2019t think you want to add $8 billion, $10 billion debt to this and live through that.\u201d Oops.Judge Cote found that the facts alleged by the plaintiffs were enough to be \u201cbadges\u201d of actual intent sufficient to allow the claim to proceed against the thousands of old Lyondell shareholders.The shareholders have not given up, filing a motion last week for reconsideration or to have the Second Circuit hear the case. The shareholders\u2019 basis for reconsideration is that there is no \u201cactual\u201d intent to defraud here. Instead, it was the Lyondell board that had agreed to sell the company to Basell.The argument can be summed up to an \u201cOh, really?\u201d Or to put it another way, are you really going to hold innocent shareholders liable when it was another party that sold the company? And let\u2019s not forget all those sophisticated banks that willingly lent that money and have not claimed to be defrauded.It\u2019s unclear what should happen. The law seems to be on the defendants\u2019 side, but more so because Delaware law is rather clear that it is the board here that makes these decisions.In other words, we are down to technicalities on whether the shareholders should pay back the $12.5 billion paid to them.That should give you an answer on whether any of this makes sense. Does anyone really think that in these cases the board actually is defrauding everyone? What about the buyer here who knew exactly what they were doing?When a lawsuit doesn\u2019t make sense but the legalities are cited, one has to wonder: Is the law really right here?Steven Davidoff Solomon is a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley.

{"Headline": "Hedge Funds Avoided Big Losses Despite \u2018Brexit\u2019 Shock", "Date": "2016-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 In late June, as Britons prepared to go to the polls to vote on the country\u2019s membership in the European Union, about 800 hedge fund managers gathered at the opulent Cavalieri hotel on a hill overlooking Rome for an annual rite.They were there to attend Goldman Sachs\u2019s European hedge fund conference; among the guests were Pershing Square Capital Management\u2019s William A. Ackman and Man GLG\u2019s managing director, Pierre Lagrange. As the illustrious group mingled with investors over cocktails, the hedge fund managers, who collectively command hundreds of billions of dollars on behalf of institutions and individuals, were for the most part upbeat. Few believed that Britain would vote to exit the European Union.But Britain did just that. The June 23 vote to leave, or \u201cBrexit\u201d as it is called, surprised many. So-called long-short hedge funds, which as their name suggests place bets on some stocks to rise and others to fall, suffered sizable losses at first.Macro funds, however, which take gargantuan positions on big economic trends and were poised to gain or lose the most from the British referendum, avoided debilitating losses, and several even made money. Some funds benefited from derivatives trades that used put options, which are bearish bets that prices for assets like stocks and currencies will drop. For traders who bought cheap put options on British pounds in the days before the vote, the payoff was huge when the pound sank.Hedge fund managers cite a number of factors that explain how some funds avoided losses. Unlike the sudden collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, Britain\u2019s vote was well telegraphed. Few funds were willing to take outsize bets on the referendum, knowing investors would have skewered them had they lost money.Some fund managers struggled to see a way of minting money on the vote, too. It was an event a few called an \u201celevator trade\u201d \u2014 a reference to the adage that stocks go up the escalator, or at an angle, and down the elevator, or straight down. The British referendum was so hyped that the result of the vote would set off either a sharp rise in risk assets or a steep plunge.Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.Still, for those who were willing to make a wager, the rewards were high. The price to bet on an exit was dirt cheap, prompting some fund managers to buy put options on stock indexes late into the evening of June 23 while the votes were still being tallied. The next morning, a sell-off in stocks around the world meant those trades profited.Conversely, managers said, it did not make sense to speculate on the vote to remain in the European Union. From a market perspective, \u201cthe much better bet was the \u2018Brexit\u2019 bet,\u201d said Borut Miklavcic, the chief investment officer and managing partner at LindenGrove Capital, a macro hedge fund based in London. \u201cAll the instruments that were betting on \u2018Brexit\u2019 were very underpriced, so you either took that side or stayed out of the way.\u201dFunds that focus on stocks fell and then recovered when the market rebounded in the weeks after the vote. Leon G. Cooperman\u2019s $1.4 billion Omega Overseas Partners lost 5.33 percent in June, bringing its first-half loss to 7.15 percent, though Mr. Cooperman said in an email this week that the fund was up for the year. And David Einhorn\u2019s $3 billion Greenlight Capital slipped 0.3 percent in June, only to gain 4.9 percent in July.Mr. Ackman\u2019s private hedge fund lost about 2 percent in June, while his public fund, which is leveraged to amplify market bets, fell 3.1 percent for the month. They snapped back in July, with his public fund rising 2.7 percent.Man GLG\u2019s European Long-Short Equity, run by Mr. Lagrange, shed 2.04 for the month as of June 24, and was down 3.88 percent for the year at that point. It was down 4.93 percent for the year as of Aug. 5.Alan Howard\u2019s macro fund Brevan Howard has been struggling with redemptions this year but eked out a positive return despite the vote. Class A shares in his $15.7 billion diversified global hedge fund rose 0.94 percent in June, bringing its first-half loss to 1.15 percent. Mr. Howard, who is a big trader of British government bonds, benefited from a rally in gilts after the vote. The smaller Master Strategy fund was up 1.5 percent in June but gave up some of its gains in July, losing 0.09 percent net of fees. For the year, as of the end of July, the fund was up 1.26 percent.Andrew E. Law\u2019s $6 billion Caxton Global Investment fund was up 1.96 percent for the month and 0.43 percent year-to-date as of June 28. Last year, the fund returned 3.53 percent. So June was a very good month for the fund, relative to recent months. Mr. Law publicly favored Britain remaining in the European Union.Hedge funds based in Britain had a better sense of the political pulse of the nation than did funds based elsewhere. The large American macro fund Moore Capital Management, run by Louis Bacon, is a case in point. Compared with the London-based Caxton, its $7.5 billion Macro Managers fund produced a return of 0.71 percent for the month that ended June 30.\u201cThe majority of the U.K.-domiciled funds were set to benefit from a \u2018leave\u2019 vote, and, at least within the group we looked at, their U.S. counterparts appeared to be positioned the other way,\u201d said Peter Laurelli, global head of research at eVestment, which tracks the alternative investment industry. Of the 10 largest macro funds that report returns to eVestment, the three that appeared in a position to benefit from the pound\u2019s depreciation all have their headquarters in Britain, Mr. Laurelli said. He declined to name the funds that report performance data to eVestment.Unlike the case with other market shocks, the vote gave fund managers the opportunity to correct course and make money. The markets did not move drastically at first when polling from two bellwether English cities, Newcastle and Sunderland, showed that the side voting to remain in the European Union was struggling.Although Sunderland\u2019s vote to exit caused the British pound to crater within minutes, it took about half an hour before the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index futures started to react, giving macro traders ample time to short stock futures, taking a bearish bet on the market that would prove to be highly profitable the next day.Managed futures funds, which invest in a wide variety of commodity, stock, bond and currency futures, also performed well, according to Lasse H. Pedersen, a principal at the $159.2 billion AQR Capital Management investment firm. Its Managed Futures Strategy Fund rose 5.58 percent in June.Mr. Pedersen explained that the main type of trading that managed futures funds do is trend-following, and this strategy performs well in crisis periods. \u201cWhen things go from normal to bad, they may not make money; but when things go from bad to worse, that is a continuation of a trend and that is when they profit,\u201d said Mr. Pedersen, the author of \u201cEfficiently Inefficient: How Smart Money Invests and Market Prices Are Determined.\u201dEven some investors who underestimated the risk of a British exit wound up making money. George Soros, who manages assets through his family office, owned pounds in the run-up to the referendum, a spokesman has said. It was a reversal of a stance that Mr. Soros took 25 years ago when he made a $1 billion windfall for his investors by selling the currency and \u201cbreaking the pound.\u201dMr. Soros initially lost money on his currency position this time. But market players and regulatory filings indicate he made up the lost ground and more by his bullish bets on gold. Among his positions in the precious metal, Mr. Soros had an investment in Barrick Gold, the world\u2019s largest gold mining company. He shed a substantial amount of that holding in recent months, reporting in a regulatory filing on Monday that he had a one-million-share stake as of the end of June, compared with the 19 million shares he held as of the end of March. He also was helped by bearish positions on stocks, particularly European financial stocks such as Deutsche Bank.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Real Estate Strikes Out on Its Own in the Stock Indexes", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersA change is coming at the end of the month in the way stock indexes are classified. Real estate, now part of the broader financials category, will go out on its own.But before you yawn and say that the change seems akin to moving the deck chairs around on a ship, consider this: It could, analysts say, have a wide-ranging impact on what individual investors own in their portfolios. That\u2019s because an increasing number of people are investing in index funds, and those funds track the various categories of investments.First, a bit of background. In 1999, Standard & Poor\u2019s and MSCI, two providers of indexes, joined forces to create 10 categories of investments that they called the Global Industry Classification Standard. The standard has allowed investors to compare the performances of companies within the same sector and analyze why their stock prices are moving as they are. The classification also forms the basis for the MSCI and S.&P. indexes.Since its inception, the financial sector has included banks, real estate, insurance companies and diversified financial groups. But in 2014, as part of regular reviews of the indexes, MSCI and what by then had become S&P Dow Jones Indices decided to create an 11th sector, real estate. (They also added a subindustry group for copper.)David Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said the decision came after lengthy debate on how real estate\u2019s role in investing had changed since the standard was created.\u201cThink back to 1999 or 2000,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one really talked about investing in real estate. We were trying to recover from the tech boom and bust.\u201dMr. Blitzer said the teams at S.&P. and MSCI agreed that it was time to give real estate its own sector. The changes will go into effect on Aug. 31 for MSCI-managed indexes and on Sept. 16 for S.&P.\u2019s indexes.The question of what the change means in the short and long term for investors has been the subject of much debate. And that has led investors to think about the value of real estate investing more broadly.Mr. Blitzer said he was confident that the new category would make investors more aware of the sector. \u201cIt\u2019s going to raise the prominence of anything related to real estate,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether it makes prices of REITs go up or down, it\u2019s not clear to me. They will get some more attention. That\u2019s a plus for an investor who follows REITs.\u201dAt its most basic, the change means people who index their investments will have a more accurate way to measure the performance of individual sectors. David B. Mazza, head of exchange-traded fund research at State Street Global Advisors, said separating real estate will make the asset class seem less forbidding to individual investors.\u201cMost investors already have some dedicated real estate exposure, as in a REIT fund or an alternatives bucket,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat this does is make real estate less of an alternative and more of a consumer staple.\u201dKim D. Arthur, chief executive of Main Management in San Francisco, said just having real estate separate from the broader financial category is going to show investors how much better real estate has performed than other sectors within that category.\u201cREITs since 2005 are up 160 percent,\u201d Mr. Arthur said. \u201cThe banks in that group are down 30 percent. People say the financials have underperformed, but it hasn\u2019t been that bad. That\u2019s because it\u2019s been masked by REITs.\u201dRecent performance aside, he noted that REITs and banks tend to react differently to interest rate movements. When rates are low, as they have been, REITs perform better because their borrowing costs go down while their rents stay fixed. When rates go up, banks do better since they can charge more to lend money.Given this, Mr. Arthur said his firm is planning to sell its holdings in real estate when they get separated from the broader financial services exchange-traded fund and buy more of a financials exchange-traded fund, despite the sector\u2019s poor run. He is betting that interest rates are more likely to rise than to continue at low levels.David Lukes, chief executive of Equity One, a REIT that owns, develops and operates shopping centers, said the additional attention would be good for a REIT like his. But he said he also believed that it would benefit investors because of the added scrutiny the sector will receive. \u201cI think we\u2019ll see even more focus on corporate governance, sustainability and dividend security,\u201d he said.Seeing real estate as a stand-alone sector in an index could also drive more money to REITs.Matt Neska, domestic equity specialist at the investment banking and asset management firm William Blair in Chicago, said professional investors had underweighted REITs to trim their overall exposure to the financial sector.He pointed to the Russell 2000 Value index, where financials accounted for about 45 percent of the stocks. Now, with the new category, it will be 30 percent financials and 14 percent real estate. \u201cA lot of your small and midcap value managers had about a 10 percentage point underweight to this new real estate sector,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven that, they have to close that gap or answer questions.\u201dHe added, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to quantify just how much capital will go into this space, but it could be a tailwind.\u201dOthers, though, argue that the REIT sector has already run up in value and that it is not only fully valued but could collapse if interest rates go up.\u201cI\u2019d be surprised to see what some people have talked about, that there will be much more money going in,\u201d said Jeanette Garretty, managing director at Robertson Stephens in San Francisco. \u201cIt may be a situation of money moving away from the banking sector and following the REITs, so it looks like more money going to REITs.\u201dMr. Mazza of State Street said the data showed that this is already happening. From the beginning of the year to the end of July, $6.1 billion has left financial exchange-traded funds and $6.6 billion has gone into real estate ones.New money going into REITs, Ms. Garretty said, could come from less sophisticated investors. \u201cFor most professional managers, I\u2019d be surprised if it\u2019s going to change their behavior much,\u201d she said. \u201cBut with the ongoing growth of index investing, it may lead to more individuals running their own portfolios putting money into REITs because there\u2019s a real estate index.\u201dAnd that could be a problem if REITs are as overvalued as some analysts believe. \u201cThey\u2019re certainly not an underowned area, but there is demand for them,\u201d Mr. Mazza said. \u201cIf we see the market pricing in an interest rate hike, we might see a reversal.\u201dBrett Carson, director of research at Carson Wealth Management in Omaha, takes a dimmer view still. He sees the whole REIT sector as overvalued.\u201cIt\u2019s a bond proxy like utilities, consumer staples and telecom, and that\u2019s a crowded place right now,\u201d he said. \u201cValuations are stretched. Maybe the fundamentals have peaked or have potentially rolled over. There are some indications, particularly within the commercial property market, that things are beginning to erode.\u201dWhether REITs are about to crash or ascend to new heights, one thing is certain: The new category will help investors track exactly how their real estate investments are doing.An earlier version of this article rendered incorrectly the name of an index discussed by Matt Neska, a domestic equity specialist. It was the Russell 2000 Value index, not the Russell 2000 index. It also rendered incorrectly the name of one of the companies that decided in 2014 to create an 11th stock index sector, real estate. It was S&P Dow Jones Indices, not Standard & Poor\u2019s. The article also misstated the S.&P. Dow Jones Indices products that will change on Sept. 16. They are indexes, not funds.Advertisement"}

The rebel advance put civilians in government-held western Aleppo at risk, increasing the total population under threat to about two million.The crisis worsened as the United Nations Security Council was briefed privately on Tuesday by the special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, and the top humanitarian aid official, Stephen O\u2019Brien. Mr. de Mistura, who has been seeking to restart peace talks, did not speak publicly afterward, but diplomats later told reporters that he did not foresee a resumption of talks in August.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want any preconditions to exist, he wants to be able to control the process, he wants to decide about the timing,\u201d said Alexis Lamek, France\u2019s deputy ambassador. \u201cI don\u2019t see how we can have meaningful talks if there is not the minimal conducive environment for that.\u201dSamantha Power, the United States ambassador, was also pessimistic: \u201cWe\u2019re in reverse gear\u201d on the issues of humanitarian access and a cessation of hostilities in the conflict, she said, the two conditions for peace talks to resume.\u201cSo we\u2019ve always understood that these were three legs on a stool, and in order for the stool to be upright, all of the legs have to be stable,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd from what we heard, we\u2019re a long way from that.\u201dMr. O\u2019Brien, who spoke outside the council\u2019s chambers after his appearance, said he had told council diplomats of \u201cthe horrific humanitarian situation in Aleppo, where fighting rages and two million people live in fear of besiegement.\u201dHe said children were especially vulnerable from the water crisis and that wells drilled in the city were \u201cnot nearly enough to sustain the population.\u201dMr. O\u2019Brien also said there had been no emergency deliveries to Aleppo this month, despite a previously negotiated agreement for humanitarian access. \u201cThis was not in line with the plan,\u201d he said.Aid delivery teams for the United Nations were \u201cready to roll\u201d if a humanitarian pause could be enforced, Mr. O\u2019Brien said, but for now it was too dangerous \u201ceven for the very brave people on the ground \u2014 they are brave, but they are not suicidal.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trading Stocks for Bonds Poses Its Own Risks", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRetiringFOR those in or near retirement, the standard investing advice has long been to dump stocks gradually and load up on bonds as you get older. The idea is to reduce the risk that a big stock market decline will wipe out much of your portfolio just when you need the money most.But in an era of ultralow bond yields and longer retirements, does the conventional wisdom need to be seriously challenged? Perhaps there\u2019s a greater risk, after all, that you will outlive your savings and that even a low inflation rate will erode the value of your investments over time if they are not growing with the economy.Chris Brightman, chief investment officer at Research Affiliates, wrote in a recent report: \u201cThese negative real rates of interest paid by an increasing proportion of the developed world\u2019s governments on their debt will not preserve our purchasing power over the long run, let alone generate the growth in real wealth necessary to achieve our investment objectives.\u201dVolatility also spooks retirement investors into doing the wrong thing at the wrong time. According to new research by Fidelity Investments, \u201clong-term investors tended to lower their stock investments during major short-term stock market declines, rather than adhering to an approach that is based on a well-thought-out, long-term investment plan.\u201dMost investors don\u2019t make multiple-decade portfolio projections, of course, but consider that many people are going to spend 30 years or more in retirement. A long-term perspective is essential.Sarah Newcomb, a behavioral economist for Morningstar, wanted to know for herself how much the cost of living was likely to increase over time \u2014 and whether her portfolio could keep up with inflation.\u201cI learned that with an average 3 percent inflation rate, prices double every 24 years,\u201d said Ms. Newcomb, who is also author of \u201cLoaded: Money, Psychology and How to Get Ahead Without Leaving Your Values Behind\u201d (Wiley, 2016).\u201cThat means that by the time I retire, my life will cost twice as much as it does now, and if I make it to my late 80s, the same lifestyle will cost four times as much then as it does today,\u201d Ms. Newcomb added. \u201cIf I am not actively saving and aggressively investing, the real risk is the risk of not retiring at all.\u201dIt\u2019s only natural to err on the side of caution when investing for retirement. After all, remembering the huge sell-off in 2008 and facing the recent volatility from the so-called Brexit vote makes millions of investors anxious. Yet they can easily take too little risk and become myopic on the erosion from inflation. Sitting on cash or holding long-term bonds isn\u2019t the answer to this perennial problem.\u201cAn adviser recently told me about a client who was left with tens of millions of dollars after the death of her husband,\u201d Ms. Newcomb said. \u201cThis woman is terrified of mishandling his money, and so she refuses to invest. The decision to keep money \u2018safe\u2019 in cash and cash equivalents guarantees a financial loss in the form of inflation.\u201dIn addition to the overall rise in the cost of living, older Americans face the likelihood that they will ultimately have to pay for some form of long-term care. Seventy percent of Americans over age 65 will need nursing, custodial or in-home care services, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.Like many health care expenses, long-term care costs are rising faster than the consumer inflation rate. Expenses for a private nursing home room, for example, rose at a 3.5 percent rate from 2011 through 2015, according to Genworth, an insurance company, compared to a current inflation rate of little more than 1 percent. The median cost of a private room is now nearly $100,000 a year.\u201cI\u2019m very concerned about long-term care risk,\u201d says Anna Rappaport, an actuarial consultant who focuses on retirement issues. \u201cA lot of people aren\u2019t focused on the long term.\u201dTo build a portfolio that will grow well ahead of the pace of inflation over the long-term means relying more on stocks that will combine growth and dividends.But even as you take more risk, you have to take a hard look at your psychology. Assess how much of a decline in the value of your portfolio you are willing to accept.\u201cIf your portfolio is down 20 percent to 30 percent, would it impact your lifestyle or could you work through it?\u201d asks Judith B. Ward, a senior certified financial planner for T. Rowe Price, the mutual fund firm.For most people, though, taking on more long-term risk doesn\u2019t mean chasing short-term gains and trading frequently.Ms. Newcomb said she had met a man on a plane who owned two small businesses but who was now trading in commodities, a highly risky endeavor that he failed to master. He asked for advice.\u201cChasing short-term returns is rarely a sound strategy for building long-term income,\u201d Ms. Newcomb said she told the man. \u201cUnless he could predict tomorrow\u2019s headlines, he needed to put more of his money to work in less speculative investments.\u201dThere are two routes to finding a workable marriage between portfolio risk and needed returns.One simple way is to run an online program to see whether your current portfolio is likely to provide enough money over time given a certain rate of return, mix of investments and your age.A \u201cMonte Carlo analysis,\u201d one of those programs, will show how long your portfolio can be expected to last. It\u2019s not a precise science, of course, since most free calculators don\u2019t allow you to include items like emergencies, long-term care or other sudden health expenses. Uncertainty is inherent in the process.Ask these professionals to run a portfolio review. They should spend time vetting your concerns, goals, legacy plans and fears. At the very least, they should be able to tailor a portfolio that conforms to your goals and concerns.Professional advisers should ask detailed questions about risk tolerance and objectives. For example: Are you prepared for long-term and out-of-pocket health care expenses? Do you plan any major lifestyle changes that will alter your spending plan? Can you cut expenses if you need to without sacrificing quality of life?Also ask advisers to identify the various types of investment risks. You can overconcentrate, for example, in one type of asset, like American stocks or bonds. That means you may be underdiversified in global companies.Or you could be overexposed in real estate or your employer\u2019s stock. Spreading your money between a diversified portfolio, primarily in stocks but also including bonds, real estate and other investments, is usually the most prudent course.In any enlightened approach, you are likely to face the decision of refocusing your portfolio to meet your needs down the road. In doing so, remember that the real risk is not doing enough to make sure your money lasts as long as you do.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Mail Boat Stays Afloat", "Date": "2016-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by12 PhotosA narrow street dead-ends at the Detroit River, where a black-and-white boat bobs in the water, emblazoned with a Postal Service eagle. This is the mail boat J.W. Westcott II, the only floating ZIP code in the United States.The little boat\u2019s ZIP code, 48222, is reserved for mail addressed to the freighters that ply the Great Lakes. It is administered by the J. W. Westcott Company of Detroit, founded in 1874 when its main job was vessel reporting \u2014 telling companies, and the families of sailors, where their ships and loved ones were.Today, its official motto is \u201cmail by the pail.\u201d It chugs out to passing freighters to deliver parcels to the crews, often by hoisting the mail with a rope and bucket. It\u2019s been a registered post office since 1948.First-class mail volume is down these days, said the owner, Jim Hogan. Most ships have wireless internet \u2014 so, like everyone else, sailors use email. \u201cBut our packages, express and priority, are up.\u201dIt\u2019s a small business that delivers everyday staples \u2014 food for the crew, a pair of pants ordered online, extra toilet paper for the voyage \u2014 to the giant vessels that carry the ore, coal, and grain that keep America running.Forty or 50 years ago, when ships and ports were less mechanized, a boat\u2019s crew had time to shop on land while their vessel was docked. \u201cThe modern sailor is a whole different game,\u201d Mr. Hogan said. \u201cYounger guys are used to ordering things online.\u201d Today, \u201cit\u2019s not as important to get the love letter from home as it is to get something that he\u2019s ordered.\u201dOver the last several decades, the Westcott Company has found a way to stay afloat and even grow, while the Postal Service has sunk deeper underwater \u2014 net losses for the second quarter of 2016 were $2 billion. While the service has laid off hundreds of thousands of people over the last five years, Mr. Hogan, 60, says he has trouble finding qualified workers.To his relief, his son Jimmy, 32, recently moved back to Detroit to take over the Westcott\u2019s billing and work as night captain. He is the fifth generation of the family to run the mail boat.The hundred or so freighters that make up the Westcott\u2019s customers each carry millions of dollars\u2019 worth of commodities like coal, iron ore, grain and limestone. With freight this valuable, time costs a lot, so barring a catastrophe, boats stop only to load or unload cargo. Mail \u2014 and anything else a ship might need \u2014 must be delivered on the fly, while the mail boat and the freighter are moving.One warm morning in late May, the mail boat chugged out to meet the Rt. Hon. Paul J. Martin, a 739-foot freighter steaming up the Detroit River. The big ship slowed but did not stop, and Capt. Bill Redding pushed the tire-clad bow of the 45-foot J.W. Westcott II snug against the sheer steel side of the Martin, keeping pace with it.Canada Steamship Lines was painted in white across the red hull, and from above the \u201cS\u201d in \u201cSteamship\u201d a man in a hard hat and red jumpsuit lowered a dirty white bucket on a black rope. Two bags, filled with six cans of Planters mixed nuts and seven boxes of K-Cup coffee, were quickly tied on by the Westcott\u2019s deck hand and hoisted aboard the freighter.Twenty-four hours earlier, the captain of the Martin had called to order the nuts and coffee, knowing that they would be delivered to his ship when it passed the Westcott office, just southwest of the Ambassador Bridge on the Michigan side of the Detroit River.Sailing two months on and one month off, \u201csailors on contemporary merchant ships are basically trapped,\u201d said Mr. Hogan, sitting in front of black-and-white family photos and hockey posters in his office. He recently read that Maersk, the largest container shipping company in the world, was experimenting with using drones to deliver to its ships. But drones are expensive and small, so Mr. Hogan is confident that it will always be cost effective to deliver bulky, low-value cargo like coffee or paper towels by boat.About one-third of the Westcott\u2019s business comes from its contract with the Postal Service, which calls the boat its only floating ZIP code. The contract was just renewed to 2021 and pays for the Westcott to deliver United States mail to any vessel free of charge. Another third comes from transporting passengers, pilots, crew and contractors at $90 per person. The remaining third is from delivering non-Postal Service packages and other goods. (The mixed nuts and coffee delivery ran $16.) \u201cIf we were one entity \u2014 just a grocery guy, just a pilot boat \u2014 I don\u2019t see that this would have continued,\u201d Mr. Hogan said.The Westcott will deliver almost anything a mariner wants. It is an authorized nautical chart retailer. It carries books, decorative boat prints and two different Lake Superior puzzles. It also stocks candy, chips and soda. Canadian ships in particular ask for cigarettes and pizza. One even has a custom-made pizza caddy that it lowers on a rope.Shipping companies send parts and machinery to their boats through the Westcott. \u201cWe try never to say no,\u201d said Sam Buchanan, a captain and manager for the company. Sailors receiving deliveries can pay over the phone with a credit card or send down cash in a bucket.The company\u2019s modest one-story building contains a back-room warehouse, mail room, dispatcher\u2019s office, small lobby and Mr. Hogan\u2019s office. Two walls of the mailroom are lined with cubbies, each labeled with a ship\u2019s name \u2014 about 50 American and 50 Canadian \u2014 alphabetized from John B. Aird to Whitefish Bay. Every morning a Westcott employee sorts the day\u2019s mail into the ship\u2019s cubbies. Each item is addressed with a ship\u2019s name, Marine Post Office, Detroit, MI 48222.While looking at charts last June in the Westcott\u2019s dispatch office, Garvie Crane, the chief engineer on the freighter Buffalo, explained that his ship usually stops only at mines to load and steel mills to unload, leaving him with just four or five hours in port.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of security, and nothing within walking distance,\u201d said Mr. Crane, 60. By the time he gets through security, calls a cab and makes it to the store, he is in danger of missing the boat. \u201cA lot of times, I\u2019ll get on for 60 days and won\u2019t get off because it\u2019s just such a hassle.\u201d The Westcott and a supplier in Cleveland are \u201creally our only two contacts with the outside world,\u201d he said.U.P.S. and FedEx trucks arrive. Packages addressed to various freighters are stacked inside the door.One morning a few months ago, Michael VanPaepeghem, 21, a deck hand, was writing the ship\u2019s name on each package in permanent marker for easy identification: Manitowoc, James L. Kuber, Defiance, Great Republic, Mississagi (\u201cThat\u2019s my favorite one to do,\u201d he said). He entered each package into the computer, then put a tag saying \u201cbag\u201d or \u201cparcel\u201d in that ship\u2019s slot.The Westcott makes 15 to 18 deliveries in 24 hours. Dispatchers track the movements of freighters by computer and radio. When a ship is due, whoever is working will go in the mailroom and toss the contents of that boat\u2019s cubby into a heavy-duty nylon mail bag, then find its parcels.The Westcott\u2019s back room is filled with supplies for the American Steamship Company, which has a special contract with the Westcott to store inventory for its fleet: AA batteries, Comet cleaner, Bounce fabric softener, Maxwell House coffee, disposable coveralls, paper galley caps and 59 other consumables. American Steamship buys the supplies in bulk, and the Westcott stores them free, delivering the supplies as needed to the company\u2019s ships for a fee.On Memorial Day weekend, Mr. Hogan received a call from the American Mariner, an American Steamship Company freighter, asking for $3,000 worth of provisions to be delivered the next day. The request was beyond what the Westcott regularly stocked, but Mr. Hogan was experimenting with a new grocery service, and word had been spreading among the ship\u2019s stewards.Mr. Hogan is excited about this possibility for growth, though he is competing with companies like Soo Marine Supply, of Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., which has a strong grocery business and a larger boat and a crane to load palletized orders onto ships. It is not a designated post office, but sailors sometimes hop off while their ships are going through the locks at Sault Ste. Marie and get their mail at the local terrestrial post office.Mr. Hogan went to Meijer, a Michigan-based Walmart-style store, and another nearby wholesaler. He filled the order, though it cost him his weekend, and it went seamlessly out to the Mariner when it passed by Monday afternoon. The Westcott charged a percentage.The following Wednesday, Mr. Hogan got a similar call from the Ken Boothe Sr., an articulated tug and barge. He went back to Meijer for Chobani yogurt, fresh doughnuts, tomatoes, fresh cilantro, frozen shrimp and about 15 boxes of other food.When Jimmy Hogan arrived for the night shift, he found the boxes stacked neatly on a trolley. Just as the sky was lightening, he backed the Westcott away from the dock and into the current, heading upriver. Inside the mail boat, which was built in 1949, a two-inch figure of St. Brendan, the patron saint of mariners, stood above the well-used brass ship\u2019s wheel.The Boothe slowed to about six miles per hour, and Jimmy turned downriver to meet its starboard side. Under the yellow sodium lights of the Boothe, the groceries and two bags of mail were swiftly handed from one vessel to the other.Another area of growth for the Westcott is the transportation of pilots like Fred Hoffe, 62. He sat in a comfortable chair in the Westcott\u2019s small lobby checking his phone one morning in June, waiting to be taken aboard the Bermuda-flagged tanker Sichem Challenge, which he would pilot to Sarnia, Ontario. In addition to the captain, any foreign-flag vessel must have an American or Canadian pilot aboard to navigate confined waters, Mr. Hoffe explained.He popped into the dispatching office and held up a packet of peanuts. \u201cOne loon in the jar,\u201d the dispatcher said. Mr. Hoffe put a Canadian dollar coin in a metal coffee can.Since he was carrying a pilot, Mr. Buchanan, Westcott\u2019s manager, started up the Huron Maid, the company\u2019s orange pilot boat. Mr. Hoffe and his luggage went aboard, and they headed out.The Sichem Challenge slowed, and Mr. Buchanan squeezed the pilot boat against the port side of the tanker. A rope ladder with wooden steps tumbled down. Mr. Buchanan maintained a slow but constant speed, holding the Maid fast against the tanker. Mr. Hoffe climbed up, the other pilot came down, and the boat peeled away.Mr. Buchanan pulled the lever to sound the horn: one long blast and two short. The deeper bass of the ship\u2019s horn responded in kind.When the Westcott pulled up to the Kaye E. Barker a couple of nights later, the freighter was loaded with 25,186 gross tons of iron ore and was riding so low in the water that the mail bag could be handed up from deck to deck. In the bag were an envelope with $5 worth of stamps, a letter addressed to the ship and a Christian Science Monitor magazine.The stamps were for Alex Weber, 23, a cadet on the ship as part of his schooling at the Great Lakes Maritime Academy in Traverse City, Mich. He will graduate as a third mate in January, and he needed postage to send in his homework assignments.Lowering the mail pail, Mr. Weber said, was one of the first things he learned to do on the Barker. \u201cHold it far enough from the boat so that the guy on the mail boat can reach it. When you bring it up, don\u2019t get it caught on anything so the mail falls out. Coil the rope up properly,\u201d he recited.\u201cTry not to put it through the windshield,\u201d the captain added.\u201cOr hit the guy on the head,\u201d the boatswain chimed in.Mr. Weber said good night and left the mess hall, but quickly reappeared. \u201cI remembered one more thing about the mail bucket,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t drop it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Simple Test to Dispel the Illusion Behind Stock Buybacks", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameStock investors have had one sweet summer so far watching the markets edge higher. With the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index at record highs and nearing 2,200, what\u2019s not to like?Here\u2019s something. As shares climb, so too do the prices companies are paying to repurchase their stock. And the companies doing so are legion.The buyback beat goes on even as complaints about these deals intensify. Some critics say that top managers who preside over big stock repurchases are failing at one of their most basic tasks: allocating capital so their businesses grow.Even worse, buybacks can be a way for executives to make a company\u2019s earnings per share look better because the purchases reduce the amount of stock it has outstanding. And when per-share earnings are a sizable component of executive pay, the motivation to do buybacks only increases.\u201cExecutives who get into that mode of thinking no longer have the ability to even think about how to invest in their companies for the long term,\u201d Mr. Lazonick said in an interview. \u201cCompanies that grow to be big and productive can be more productive, but they have to be reinvesting.\u201dBroadly speaking, those reinvestments appear to be in decline. Indeed, economists are concerned about the comparatively low levels of business investment since the economy emerged from the downturn more than seven years ago. This phenomenon may be attributable in part to the buyback binge.One of the best arguments against stock repurchases is that they offer only a one-time gain while investing intelligently in a company\u2019s operations can generate years of returns.\u201cThe simplest way to evaluate a company\u2019s asset allocation decisions over the years is to see whether its net profit growth is close to its earnings-per-share growth,\u201d Mr. Colby said. \u201cUnlike an investment in the business, share buybacks have no effect on net profit and there is no compounding in future years.\u201dMr. Colby has developed an illuminating analysis that identifies a crucial difference between many truly successful companies and their underperforming counterparts. The exercise highlights the growth mirage that buybacks have on earnings-per-share measures. In addition, it shows that returns on investment need not be that large for a company to generate growth rates exceeding the evanescent earnings-per-share gains associated with buybacks.In his test, Mr. Colby compared net profit growth and earnings-per-share gains at pairs of companies in the same industries from 2008 through 2015. In each case, he contrasted a company that bought back loads of shares during the period with another that did not.Cracker Barrel passed the net profit test ably: Its growth in earnings per share over those years was 13.6 percent a year while its net income grew at a virtually identical 14 percent.Jack in the Box made quite a contrast. Its annual earnings per share rose by 6 percent over the period, but its net profit declined by 0.5 percent a year.To bring its net profit to the level of growth it showed in per-share earnings, Mr. Colby said, Jack in the Box would have had to generate after-tax returns of only 4.8 percent on the $1.2 billion it spent buying back shares. That doesn\u2019t seem insurmountable.Linda Wallace, a spokeswoman for Jack in the Box, said the company\u2019s business model generated significant cash flow, \u201cwhich our shareholders have told us they prefer to be returned to them in the form of share repurchases and dividends.\u201dShe added that the average price the company paid to buy back its stock during the period was just under $37 a share, well below Friday\u2019s closing price of $98.93.Another notable buyback comparison was between Costco and Target, two large discount retailers. While Costco spent $2.7 billion to repurchase shares from 2008 through 2015, Target allocated $11.4 billion, reducing its share count by 20 percent.Costco\u2019s annual earnings-per-share gains of 9 percent during the period were almost identical to its 8.9 percent net profit growth.Target\u2019s numbers tell a different story. On the strength of its repurchases, Target\u2019s earnings per share rose by 7.3 percent each year. Its annual net profit growth was just 4.3 percent, Mr. Colby found.To close that gap, Mr. Colby calculated the after-tax investment returns Target would have had to generate on the $11.4 billion it spent on buybacks. The answer was a surprisingly nominal 5 percent.Erin Conroy, a Target spokeswoman, said the company\u2019s capital allocation priorities focus on \u201cgrowing long-term shareholder value and supporting our enterprise strategy.\u201d She cited Target\u2019s practice of annual dividend increases and said that last year, the company added an infrastructure and investment committee to its board to provide more oversight of investments.The net profit test, said Gary Lutin, a former investment banker who heads the forum, \u201ccuts through to the essential logic of comparing a process that grows a bigger pie \u2014 reinvestment \u2014 to a process that divides a shrunken pie among fewer people: share buybacks.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious,\u201d he continued, \u201cthat even mediocre returns from reinvesting in the production of goods and services will beat what\u2019s effectively a liquidation plan.\u201dInvestors may be dazzled by the earnings-per-share gains that buybacks can achieve, but who really wants to own a company in the process of liquidating itself? Maybe it\u2019s time to ask harder questions of corporate executives about why their companies aren\u2019t deploying their precious resources more effectively elsewhere.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Firm Sells Its Contrarian Investments With Field Trips", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersSTEPHEN EMERY has a day job that positions him well to understand how to invest other people\u2019s money. He is the managing director of sales and trading at Mission Capital Advisors, which focuses on real estate securities.But investing his own money poses different challenges. So when asked this year by a financial adviser to join an investment trip to Silicon Valley, he jumped at the chance.\u201cThe trip to the Valley was fascinating and tremendously beneficial,\u201d said Mr. Emery, 38, who lives in New York. \u201cThere were 15 or 18 of us who are business leaders in their communities but their communities aren\u2019t tied to Silicon Valley.\u201dCharlie Gross, who runs a family investment office in Alabama, went on a similar trip but closer to home. A few years ago he toured real estate in the Gulf Coast of Alabama and Florida, which reassured him that there were properties worth investing in, even though the area was only barely removed from the housing crash and BP oil spill.\u201cWe set foot on the ground to see these developments firsthand,\u201d Mr. Gross said. \u201cWe saw these developments selling at bargain-basement prices. But these subdivisions had all these amenities, plus the sewers and gates and roads.\u201dAdvisers often struggle to communicate a complicated investment thesis to clients who may be successful in business in their own right but are less sophisticated when it comes to investing their personal wealth.The trips Mr. Emery and Mr. Gross took were devised to be different from the typical pitch process. They were the idea of a boutique adviser, Bienville Capital, to let people see the investments for themselves. The trips offered the chance to do the kind of due diligence that professional investors, backed by hundreds of millions of dollars, routinely do before making large investments but that individual investors, even those worth millions of dollars, usually do not.While going on these trips was intriguing for the people who made them, are they a good idea for most investors, even wealthy ones? Does spending time with the companies and the advisers investing their money make it easier or tougher to assess the opportunities objectively? Are they just marketing boondoggles?Bienville, which manages $1.2 billion and began the trips when it started its Gulf Coast Opportunities Fund in 2012, maintains that they deliver real value.The firm has since done a series of trips tied to investment opportunities: the economic benefits of a change of government in Argentina; its Silicon Valley venture fund; and a new Brazil fund, started this month, that is betting on gains from new political leadership there.\u201cWe think we\u2019ll be more successful executing a contrarian thesis if people see what they\u2019re investing in,\u201d said Cullen Thompson, president and chief investment officer of Bienville.Mr. Thompson said one initial reason to take investors on these trips was to make them comfortable with investments that could not be liquid if the strategy was to work. The Brazil fund, for example, has a three-year lockup so that Bienville can make investments through the next national election. The Argentina fund has a five-year lockup.\u201cWe thought that to get locked-up capital in a contrarian thesis that seems quite scary, it would behoove all of us to show some of our investors what we\u2019re buying and why we\u2019re buying it,\u201d he said. \u201cTo do that, they had to travel down with us.\u201dOn these trips, Bienville covers the cost of working meals but the investors must pay their own travel expenses. Investments from individuals have ranged from $500,000 to $10 million.As for returns, the Gulf Coast Opportunities Fund was up 65 percent since inception and the fund based on the Argentina strategy was up 39 percent.Those who attended the Bienville trips said they were rigorous and concentrated.\u201cWe had access to the guys who had done the work,\u201d said Mr. Gross, who not only went on the Gulf Coast trip but also joined the Silicon Valley tour group. \u201cThey\u2019d express why they were doing what they were doing. I was with other investors and we were able to compare notes, as well as to involve ourselves in a Q. and A. with these guys.\u201dMr. Emery said that being in Silicon Valley gave him a sense of the investments that he couldn\u2019t get from pitch books.\u201cTo hear a C.E.O. give you their whole pitch just like they would an institutional investor and hear their whole business plan, it\u2019s tremendously valuable,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a professional investor that\u2019s what I try to do.\u201dOther professionals see value in different approaches.After doing his own due diligence on a fund that invested in health care royalties, Jordan Waxman, managing partner at HSW Advisors at HighTower, said he thought of a way to explain a good opportunity to his clients. While they had average net worths of $30 million to $40 million, their level of financial sophistication varied widely, he said.\u201cWe said, \u2018Our goal is to invest in something that doesn\u2019t correlate with the stock market,\u2019\u201d he told me. \u201cThen we showed them: This is what drug prices have done during recessions. See it. Get it? Yes, I get it. Great.\u201cThen we said, \u2018We\u2019re going out to inventors and universities or drug companies that need money.\u2019 They say, \u2018Are you speculating on drugs?\u2019 We say, \u2018No, they\u2019ve already been approved. We know this drug is going to do, say, $100 million over five years. We\u2019re going to buy it for $50 million because we get this at a discount today.\u2019\u201dIn the end, he said about 30 of the 45 clients accepted the idea.The performance of elaborate investments like these, of course, does not always match the promise. In many cases, investors, even wealthy ones, might be better off with simpler investments that they can more easily understand.Melissa Corrado-Harrison, managing director and private wealth adviser at UBS Private Wealth Management, said she educated her clients on the risks of their investments as much as on the investments themselves.\u201cIn the hedge fund world, it can be almost impossible to assess what is really going on. Private equity is a little easier but still difficult,\u201d Ms. Corrado-Harrison said. \u201cHow do we compare that risk to stocks, bonds and traditional examples?\u201dWhen there isn\u2019t a clear reason to tie up money in a riskier deal, she says she encourages clients to stick with more liquid investments.\u201cJust because I take more risk in the markets,\u201d she said, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t necessarily produce better results.\u201dMr. Thompson said inviting clients on the Bienville trips was a way to give some degree of openness in a relatively closed process. \u201cWe were telling them about the actual decision-making process,\u201d he said. \u201cThey became familiar with the assets. They became engaged with the thesis.\u201dThat may work better with physical assets, like buildings, than with more esoteric investments.Ida Liu, the global market manager for the New York metropolitan region at Citibank Private Bank, said the firm created a vehicle for clients to invest in 432 Park Avenue, the tallest residential building in New York City. She said clients were recently at a reception in the building, which was finished last year.But she said an investment in European distressed debt, an idea the bank is promoting now, could be just as good, if less tangible. Which one is right for someone goes back to understanding a client\u2019s tolerance for risk, she said \u2014 not where that conversation is taking place.\u201cWe can\u2019t ever guarantee anything,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat if the real estate market collapses? We are always in discussions to present a fair view of the potential upside and the risks associated with every investment.\u201dMr. Thompson stands by his field trip approach. \u201cThe ideas are a lot contrarian,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that requires a little bit of extra effort, then it\u2019s worth it. They get to see the investments they\u2019re investing in and also where their fees are going.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Icahn \u2014 two Wall Street hedge fund giants \u2014 duke it out over a nutritional supplements company called Herbalife. Arguing that the company is a pyramid scheme, Mr. Ackman stakes $1 billion on a wager that the stock will go to zero. Mr. Icahn, calling him a \u201ccrybaby in the schoolyard,\u201d buys as many shares in Herbalife as he can.The two stand their ground for years. Then they publicly make up. And now, there\u2019s a twist: On Friday, Mr. Ackman said that bankers recently offered to sell him Mr. Icahn\u2019s shares.In an interview, Mr. Ackman said he was contacted this month by bankers at Jefferies, the investment bank, who told him they were planning to put together a trade to buy out Herbalife\u2019s biggest shareholder (that\u2019s Mr. Icahn, who owns an 18.3 percent stake). The bankers asked Mr. Ackman if he was open to buying stock to \u201ccover\u201d his short position, which would in effect reverse some of his bet against Herbalife.\u201cI said absolutely not,\u201d Mr. Ackman said.

Mr. Icahn also said that he bought another 2.3 million shares of Herbalife on Friday.It is all part of the latest act in a four-year drama involving the two investors that has riveted and at times bewildered Wall Street. Such well-known investors as George Soros and Daniel S. Loeb have made cameo appearances as well.The news was a moral victory for Mr. Ackman, who has argued for years that Herbalife was deceiving customers. But it also seemed that Mr. Icahn had won the war over the future of the company because the F.T.C. stopped short of shutting it down.And Mr. Icahn wasted little time relishing the apparent victory. In a statement issued the same day, he indicated that he might even be interested in doubling down on his position.Herbalife said it would let him increase his ownership stake to as much as 35 percent. The company also said that it had been \u201cunder attack by an intransigent short-seller hellbent on a misinformation campaign designed to destroy our company.\u201dTheatrics are not unusual for Mr. Ackman and Mr. Icahn. Both built multibillion-dollar hedge funds and their reputations by being brash and making contrarian, sometimes controversial, statements about the companies they invest in or against.Mr. Ackman specializes in making big, concentrated bets. Sometimes his investments score big, but that\u2019s not always the case. Here\u2019s how some of his ideas have fared.The two men have traded barbs in the past over other business disputes, too.At an investment conference in Manhattan last year, the two appeared to agree to disagree on their latest dispute, publicly embracing on stage.\u201cIt\u2019s not about winning,\u201c Mr. Ackman said at the time, but quickly added, \u201cI would love to get Carl out of this stock.\u201dIn his interview on Friday, however, Mr. Ackman said that the two of them now seemed to be in agreement about Herbalife, adding that Mr. Icahn\u2019s public comments last month about pursuing opportunities for Herbalife was a \u201chead fake.\u201d\u201cHerbalife is a confidence game. Carl is the chief confidence guy. When Carl exits, it tells you something,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI view it as very favorable for us.\u201dMr. Icahn lashed back, countering that Mr. Ackman \u201cmay be a smart guy but he has clearly succumbed to the same dangerous (and sometimes fatal) malady that afflicts many investors \u2014 he\u2019s developed a very bad case of \u2018Herbalife obsession.\u2019\u201dMr. Icahn went further. \u201cIt amazes me that a guy who hasn\u2019t any knowledge of my internal investment thinking believes he is in a position to go on television to tell the world what I AM thinking! Amazing!\u201dIn his battle against Herbalife, Mr. Ackman has pulled out all the stops and promised to go \u201cto the end of the earth\u201d to bring down the company. He has spent tens of millions of dollars on research and legal fees in a campaign against the company. He has walked the halls of Congress, pressing lawmakers to take action, and personally urged regulators to shut the company down.Mr. Ackman has given presentations that last hours (his first presentation in 2012 went on for more than three hours). He has even cried on stage while likening Herbalife\u2019s practices to those of the mafia and the Nazis.All the while, Mr. Ackman has lost billions of dollars on his bet, which makes money only when the stock price falls. So far this year, Mr. Ackman has lost 15.5 percent for investors in his Pershing Square Holdings hedge fund. Some of those losses have come from his bet against Herbalife, as well as from a wrong-footed bet on Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, which has come under regulatory and public scrutiny over the last year.Mr. Icahn, on the other hand, bought Herbalife stock at an average price of $40 a share and has made quite a bit of money as the stock price has soared. Although the stock dropped 1.4 percent on Friday, it has been trading around $60 a share over the last month.Speaking on Friday, Mr. Ackman said he would continue his pursuit to shut down Herbalife and maintain his short position in the stock.\u201cI\u2019ve suffered through the hardest part,\u201d he said.Mr. Icahn had a different message. In a warning directed at Mr. Ackman, he said: \u201cObsessions concerning the value of stocks are the undoing of many investors because they often blind you to the facts, and it becomes impossible to see the forest for the trees.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Novel Charts the Struggles of Three Women in an Age of Declining Privacy", "Date": "2016-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.It\u2019s a bold novelist who dares write from the perspective of the opposite gender in these sensitive times. A man who decides to explore the sexual and emotional makeup of three generations of women must, at every turn, check his privilege, avert his \u201cmale gaze\u201d and for the love of God, no \u201cmansplaining.\u201d In his new novel, \u201cThe Inseparables,\u201d Stuart Nadler has successfully braved this potential minefield in order to bring us the wonderfully authentic Olyphant women.In the 1960s, Henrietta Olyphant gave lectures on female sexuality, social shame and the \u201cgendered economy of housework.\u201d She might have imagined that women would someday enjoy sex on a more equal standing with men \u2014 unfettered by the shackles of domesticity and free of society\u2019s disapproving glare. Unfortunately, decades later, Henrietta, her daughter and granddaughter are each descending into a weeklong sexual shame spiral.Henrietta is dreading the coming reissue of her novel, \u201cThe Inseparables.\u201d Originally published in the 1970s, the X-rated best seller includes Henrietta\u2019s own comic illustrations of vaginas, penises and outlandish sexual predicaments. It was meant to poke fun at traditional views on marriage and fidelity. Instead, it was savaged by critics and feminists, and adored by the very people she had meant to mock \u2014 doting housewives and lusty, leering men. Henrietta needs the money from the book\u2019s new edition; her beloved but careless husband, Harold, died almost a year ago, leaving her with significant debt. Still, Henrietta wishes she had never written the book she has always called \u201cthat thing.\u201dHenrietta\u2019s daughter, Oona, a busy orthopedic surgeon, has left her slacker husband, Spencer, and moved back in with her mother. She and Spencer saw a marriage counselor before they separated. Now Oona is really seeing the marriage counselor \u2014 they have begun to date. And to complete the family dysfunction trifecta, Oona\u2019s 15-year-old daughter, Lydia, has just been suspended from boarding school for allegedly sending a photo of her bare breasts to a male classmate, who then shared it with the entire school.There is much to enjoy about this book. I laughed out loud at scenes like the one in which the estranged Spencer joins the Olyphant women for dinner, unaware that his former therapist is hiding in the attic. But the most memorable moments examine the intricacies of familial love \u2014 the bonds between mothers and daughters, men and women, boys and girls. Henrietta\u2019s memories of Harold\u2019s professional rise and fall are particularly poignant. Like Henrietta, Harold had a fleeting moment of fame. His restaurant, the Feast, was once one of Boston\u2019s most popular and critically acclaimed dining establishments. Eventually it became a \u201cmuseum of butter,\u201d with its rich, French-inspired menu that had gone out of vogue. Harold refused to adapt to changing dietary trends, and Henrietta tried to protect her husband from despair during the restaurant\u2019s slow and painful decline. Her quiet devotion to Harold is beautifully paralleled in a chapter about Harold\u2019s solemn love for the animals that were sacrificed for his rich stocks and stews.\u201cHis meat, he said once, was like the color a painter had to extract from a berry that grew only on one bush, and bloomed for only one week. .\u2008.\u2008. He cooked slowly. He watched through the kitchen doors as people ate. He wanted to see the satisfaction. Wash their dish. Send them home happy.\u201dOne can\u2019t help drawing a parallel to \u00adNadler\u2019s writing as well: carefully \u00adrendered, unpretentious and always with the reader\u2019s satisfaction on the front burner.Ann Leary\u2019s new novel, \u201cThe Children,\u201d was published in May.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jefferies, Free of the Restraints of Bigger Banks, Is Emboldened", "Date": "2016-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the activist investor Carl C. Icahn bought 15 percent of the organic and natural products maker Hain Celestial in 2010, the company\u2019s chief turned for advice to Mr. Icahn\u2019s own Wall Street banker, Richard Handler, the chief executive of the investment bank Jefferies.When Mr. Icahn decided to sell that stake at a big profit three years later, Jefferies was the buyer. It quickly resold the shares to its clients in two bites for a total of $611 million.In the six years since regulators forced Wall Street banks to rein in risk-taking, Jefferies has emerged with an appetite for risk and a set of relationships to rival bigger Wall Street firms. It never took federal bailout money. Now, as a subsidiary of the conglomerate Leucadia National, Jefferies is not subject to the trading restrictions and capital requirements imposed on other investment banks that did take bailout funds and became part of bank holding companies. That gives it room to make bolder moves than some of its larger peers.It is easier for Jefferies to do deals that exceed \u201ccookie cutter\u201d debt limits, said Chris Kotowski, an analyst at Oppenheimer.Although Jefferies\u2019s $37 billion in assets remain tiny next to Wall Street giants like Goldman Sachs at $878 billion, its share of Wall Street trading has doubled since 2006, and Leucadia \u201ccan write a significant equity check at a moment\u2019s notice,\u201d Mr. Kotowski said.Leucadia\u2019s willingness to provide such capital relatively quickly \u201cstands in contrast with big bank holding companies which have shrunk and retreated,\u201d said Bill Ford, the chief executive of General Atlantic, which manages $17 billion and invested alongside Jefferies in Knight.Mike Holland, a money manager, said Leucadia was \u201cnot afraid to go there wherever there is and have a look.\u201dSome of its risks have backfired, however. Leucadia, which bought Jefferies in 2012, has since booked losses from the investment bank\u2019s exposure to energy, junk bonds and Bache, the commodity division that it bought from Prudential in 2011 and sold to Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale last year. Leucadia also stumbled because of its own 79 percent stake in National Beef, a meat-processing business that has been struggling.Shares of Leucadia fell 46 percent from their peak in May 2013 through last year, while those of 13 business peers rose an average 14 percent. This year, despite battling volatile markets early in the year, Leucadia has outperformed as results started to rebound. At Jefferies, profit for the second quarter, which ended in May, was 10 percent lower than the same period a year ago but compared favorably with a $167 million first-quarter loss. In a statement announcing earnings, Mr. Handler said conditions were returning to \u201ca more normal level.\u201dMr. Handler, who became the Jefferies chief executive in 2001 and chairman the following year, does not court media attention or like to be photographed. He dresses casually in polo shirts as he works in his Manhattan corner office, which is decorated with a picture of him and a fellow New Jersey native, Bruce Springsteen, on the wall.Under his leadership, Jefferies had the best stock performance of any investment bank through 2012, Mr. Kotowski said, sailing relatively unscathed through the financial crisis, in part by selling a 14 percent stake to Leucadia in early 2008.The trading and merchant banking risks the firm now takes are no greater than those for other Wall Street dealers, say people at the firm. Jefferies says it has cut its leverage, or the ratio of assets to equity capital, from 17 in 2010 to a current 10. The current level is below that of competitors, Moody\u2019s Investors Service said.This year, Jefferies\u2019s interests in the growing financial technology field put it back in the spotlight. Jefferies has packaged loans for resale to investors from upstart lenders including Avant, CircleBack Lending and OnDeck. The firm ranks an outsize No. 5 in underwriting such loan packages, according to PeerIQ, which tracks marketplace lending. Jefferies has also taken venture capital-style equity stakes in two financial tech lending start-ups, Affirm and Bond Street.Jefferies is also linked to Lending Club, the peer-to-peer lender that has been in turmoil since an internal investigation revealed improprieties in the sale of loans and a separate disclosure issue, which resulted in the ouster of its chief executive in May. About $22 million in loans sold to Jefferies did not meet the investment bank\u2019s criteria, and the company bought them back.Leucadia\u2019s other non-Jefferies-related assets remain a grab bag, including an Italian broadband company, a plastic net maker, auto dealers, timber and real estate. And the jury is out on more than $500 million in postmerger investments in energy and gold mining, and another $500 million in hedge funds.Mr. Kotowski of Oppenheimer is bullish, but some investors shun the stock. Ted Hart, who follows financial stocks at Tufton Capital Management in Baltimore, said the new Leucadia with Jefferies as its core was highly correlated with the high-yield debt market. In its former life as a multi-industry conglomerate, \u201cIf one business wasn\u2019t doing well, you had another that was picking up the slack,\u201d Mr. Hart said.But now, he added: \u201cThe outlook for Leucadia is kind of the outlook for the high-yield market, which isn\u2019t too rosy. With oil prices remaining low, Leucadia may continue to struggle in high-yield debt underwriting and trading. It looks cheap on a price-to-book-value basis, but it\u2019s an entirely different company.\u201dThe son of a tax preparer from Fair Lawn, N.J., Mr. Handler, 55, sold vacuum cleaners door-to-door and life insurance at a bank before graduating from the University of Rochester. After a stint as a junior analyst at First Boston during its Wasserstein Perella mid-1980s heyday, he got an M.B.A. from Stanford and worked in the Los Angeles office of Drexel Burnham Lambert before that firm\u2019s demise in 1990. He built the Jefferies junk-bond desk before he became chief executive.At Jefferies, trading and banking often rest partly on relationships, trust and loyalty \u2014 a culture set by Mr. Handler. His dealings with Mr. Icahn, once a prominent Drexel client, illustrate that point. Jefferies led or helped lead bond sales of $3.7 billion in 2014 and $2 billion in 2010 for Icahn Enterprises, Mr. Icahn\u2019s main investment vehicle.Mr. Handler\u2019s Drexel relationships were on display at an 80th birthday gathering he hosted for Mr. Icahn at a New York steakhouse in February.On hand were Michael Milken, Drexel\u2019s onetime junk-bond chief; Leon Black, a former top Drexel banker who is now chief executive of the private equity firm Apollo Global Management; and the former Drexel client Bennett LeBow, now chairman of the Vector Group, another staunch Jefferies client.The same group, minus Mr. Milken, meets monthly, said an attendee, Howard Lorber, chief of the Vector Group, a tobacco producer and majority owner of the Douglas Elliman real estate brokerage firm. Mr. Handler values his close relationship with Mr. Milken, longtime associates say.Irwin Simon, chief of Hain Celestial, recalled that as he got to know Mr. Icahn and Mr. Handler, he wound up having dinner at Mr. Icahn\u2019s beachfront mansion in East Hampton. And after he had knee surgery, Mr. Handler visited him at home. \u201cHe\u2019s a tough negotiator and good businessman,\u201d Mr. Simon said. \u201cI believe he is a very honest and loyal person, but I wouldn\u2019t want to cross him.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bank of England Cuts Interest Rate to Historic Low, Citing Economic Pressures", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe move comes at a time of widespread uncertainty about the longer-term impact of the vote to leave the bloc, known as Brexit. It is unclear what Britain\u2019s future trading relationship will be with the European Union, and crucially, how much access London\u2019s prized financial services industry will have to the Continent. The referendum also unleashed a summer of political turmoil that led to a new government and to questions about the new leadership\u2019s economic policies.\u201cThere is a clear case for stimulus, and stimulus now, in order to be there when the economy really needs it \u2014 to have an effect when the economy really needs it,\u201d Mark J. Carney, the bank\u2019s governor, said at a news conference on Thursday.The central bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee voted unanimously to lower its benchmark interest rate to 0.25 percent, the lowest level in the bank\u2019s 322 years. The rate had been at 0.5 percent since March 2009.Mr. Carney also signaled on Thursday that the committee could cut rates further this year, but he ruled out the possibility of negative interest rates. The committee\u2019s next meeting is set for November.The bank also said that it would introduce a series of additional measures to support the economy, predicting that there would be little growth in the second half of this year and that economic growth would decline sharply next year compared with its earlier forecast for 2017.\u201cThis is a timely, coherent and comprehensive package of measures,\u201d Mr. Carney said. \u201cIt is appropriately sized given the scale of the shock, the uncertainties about the degree of the adjustment and the relatively limited data.\u201dThose measures included increasing the size of a bond-buying program, part of a policy known as quantitative easing, which is intended to cut market interest rates and stimulate the economy.The bank said on Thursday that it would buy an additional 60 billion pounds, or about $80 billion, in assets under the program, increasing the total to \u00a3435 billion.The Bank of England also said that it would buy up to \u00a310 billion in investment grade corporate bonds from nonfinancial companies. It stipulated that the bonds must be traded in pounds and that the companies must be \u201cmaking a material contribution\u201d to the British economy. The new private-sector bond buying program is expected to begin next month.The bank will choose from a pool of about 150 companies, accounting for about \u00a3150 billion in corporate bonds, according to Minouche Shafik, the central bank\u2019s deputy governor for markets and banking.The central bank also said it would start a program to make it easier for banks to provide lower lending rates to households and businesses, and would penalize the banks if the net level of lending fell.\u201cDemand is expected to be markedly weaker, and unemployment higher, than projected in May,\u201d Mr. Carney said on Thursday in a letter to Philip Hammond, the chancellor of the Exchequer.Lucy O\u2019Carroll, chief economist at Aberdeen Asset Management, said Mr. Carney was clear in his message on Thursday that monetary policy could go only so far in supporting the economy in light of the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote.\u201cWhat will really count is whether the chancellor provides a fiscal boost in the autumn,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Carroll said, referring to a planned budget update this year. \u201cMonetary policy can\u2019t do much more on its own.\u201dIn cutting its economic growth forecasts for the coming years, the central bank on Thursday said it expected the economy to grow at about 2 percent in 2016, but at a slower rate in the second half of the year.It projected gross domestic product would grow at 0.8 percent in 2017, and 1.8 percent in 2018. It had predicted the economy would expand 2.3 percent in each of those years.It was the biggest downgrade between inflation reports since the central bank began making public forecasts in 1993.The central bank also said it believed that the annual inflation rate over the next three years would surpass its policy target of 2 percent, reaching 2.4 percent in 2018 as a weak currency pushed up the prices of imported goods and services.The bank sees a 2 percent inflation rate as a sign of healthy economic growth. Twelve-month consumer price inflation stood at 0.5 percent in June.An earlier photograph and picture caption with this article were published in error.

{"Headline": "Morgan Stanley Neglected Warnings on Broker", "Date": "2016-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA troubling call came in to Morgan Stanley\u2019s internal hotline in May 2010.One of the company\u2019s top financial advisers in Mississippi, Steve Wyatt, was struggling with medications and was \u201cnot sleeping, coming in 3 and 4 a.m.,\u201d his assistant said on the call, according to notes taken by the person who answered the phone. Mr. Wyatt, a broker, was also trading client money \u201cerratically,\u201d the assistant said.Morgan Stanley is one of the top banks on Wall Street, operating one of the most sophisticated financial advisory businesses in the world. But when the call came in, there was little effort to help fix the problems, Mr. Wyatt\u2019s colleagues \u2014 and Mr. Wyatt himself \u2014 testified in arbitration.This was not the only time Morgan Stanley did not heed warnings about Mr. Wyatt, who managed tens of millions of dollars of customer money, according to a settlement this week and documents from arbitration cases against him and the company.During Mr. Wyatt\u2019s five years at the company, supervisors and compliance officers noted his problematic behavior and business patterns many times and failed to step in, documents show. Lawyers for his former clients claim that they lost about half their money, or around $50 million.Mr. Wyatt\u2019s case, while involving just one broker, reveals the difficulty that even sophisticated companies can encounter in supervising their far-flung networks of brokers, who manage the retirement savings of millions of people nationwide.Wall Street companies have been expanding into wealth management and brokerage services, as profits from other businesses have been under pressure from regulations imposed after the 2008 financial crisis. Morgan Stanley now has nearly 16,000 financial advisers, one of the largest such forces of any company.Mr. Wyatt, who oversaw more than $100 million in client money, was fired in 2012, more than two years after that phone call and after more concerns were raised.In an interview, Mr. Wyatt, now 44, described falling into depression and having suicidal feelings, set off by the chaos of the financial crisis and its aftermath. He said his supervisors never offered help or expressed concern. \u201cIf they thought I was suicidal, if they thought I was depressed, nobody mentioned anything to me \u2014 concerned or otherwise,\u201d he said.This week, the Mississippi secretary of state said in a settlement with Morgan Stanley that it had \u201cfailed to reasonably supervise\u201d Mr. Wyatt. \u201cClearly, they had warning signs \u2014 they had indications of personal issues,\u201d Delbert Hosemann, the Mississippi secretary of state, said of Morgan Stanley. \u201cAll of those were either dealt with in a cursory manner or not dealt with at all.\u201dThe settlement barred Mr. Wyatt and his immediate supervisor from the securities industry for life. Morgan Stanley was also instructed to create a $4.2 million fund to reimburse clients, a small part of what customers claim they lost with Mr. Wyatt.Morgan Stanley did not admit or deny the accusations in the state settlement.The company is fighting dozens of Mr. Wyatt\u2019s former clients in arbitration. It has said in legal documents that the clients were \u201cnegligent\u201d for not following Mr. Wyatt more closely. In the three arbitration cases that have been decided so far, Morgan Stanley has had to pay about $3 million.James Wiggins, a spokesman for the company, said this week that many of Mr. Wyatt\u2019s losses had resulted largely from the turmoil caused by the financial crisis.\u201cWe take extremely seriously our responsibility for placing our clients\u2019 interest first,\u201d Mr. Wiggins said.The state settlement provides few details about the behavior that got Mr. Wyatt and Morgan Stanley into trouble. But closed testimony and thousands of pages of documents from the arbitration cases reviewed by The New York Times shed light on how the matter played out at the company.At one point, Mr. Wyatt\u2019s behavior raised enough concern that Morgan Stanley supervisors stopped him from trading in his personal accounts. At the same time, the company allowed him to continue trading money he managed for clients.One of his colleagues in Mississippi said in closed arbitration testimony that she and others in the office were suffering from a \u201cbasic shock that nothing was happening to help Steve, help the clients, help the firm, help the office with what was going on,\u201d according to a transcript.\u201cThe broker is a problem in this case,\u201d said Joseph Peiffer, a lawyer representing some of Mr. Wyatt\u2019s clients. \u201cBut the real problem is that he was allowed to do what he did by Morgan Stanley.\u201dWhen Mr. Wyatt was brought to Morgan Stanley in 2007 by Fred Brister, the manager of the Ridgeland, Miss., branch, there were no black marks on his regulatory record from more than a decade at Smith Barney. Jessica Clarke, one of Mr. Wyatt\u2019s customers at Morgan Stanley, said he was a gregarious salesman who won her account with his confidence. A \u201cboy genius,\u201d Ms. Clarke, 84, said.\u201cI WILL MAKE YOU A PILE OF MONEY,\u201d he wrote in an email to another client in 2007. \u201cIt ain\u2019t gonna be easy and it may seem unorthodox at times but stay with me and do what I say.\u201dThe evidence now being used against Mr. Wyatt in arbitration began to pile up soon after he joined Morgan Stanley.In his first year, he took the money in some of his clients\u2019 accounts and put it in just two stocks \u2014 BlackBerry, the cellphone maker, and Valence, a battery maker that later went bankrupt. Four clients who went to arbitration last year saw their investments in both stocks fall more than 60 percent, according to their records.Morgan Stanley has said in legal documents that those stock trades were made in accounts that customers controlled. The customers said Mr. Wyatt rarely consulted them before trading and did not ask for approval on the big holdings of BlackBerry and Valence \u2014 behavior the Mississippi secretary of state also noted.Less than a year after Mr. Wyatt arrived, the Morgan Stanley risk officer in the Mississippi branch had made a handwritten list of \u201cTriggers on Steve\u201d with 10 problems, including trade errors, high fees and significant losses.Fran Finch, another broker in the office, merged some of her clients with Mr. Wyatt\u2019s when he joined Morgan Stanley, because of his apparent success in bringing in revenue. But she testified that in 2010 she took her clients away from Mr. Wyatt as his behavior and financial returns grew more erratic.Morgan Stanley\u2019s compliance officials were also taking notice. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously not paying attention to what he\u2019s doing in his client\u2019s accounts,\u201d a compliance official from the company wrote in April 2010.It was two months later that Mr. Wyatt\u2019s assistant, Debbie Dotson, called the human resources hotline to express her concerns.When Ms. Dotson did so, \u201cmanagement responded appropriately and discussed those concerns with Mr. Wyatt,\u201d Mr. Wiggins, the Morgan Stanley spokesman, said. \u201cThat discussion had the desired results, and no subsequent concerns were raised.\u201dMr. Wyatt said in an interview and in arbitration testimony that he had no memory of his supervisors approaching him about his mental state or behavior.Two months after the call, Ms. Finch, the fellow broker, wrote to Mr. Brister, the branch supervisor, telling him he was not doing enough to manage the problems created by Mr. Wyatt. She wrote in the email that Mr. Wyatt was \u201cincapacitated for reasons you are well aware.\u201dA few months later, Mr. Wyatt bypassed Morgan Stanley\u2019s controls and bought 60 percent of the outstanding shares of a small Israeli computer cable company, RiT, for his clients. The heavy concentration in a single stock set off a warning from Morgan Stanley\u2019s compliance department.But despite email conversations about the need to crack down on Mr. Wyatt, he continued to buy shares of RiT for clients for months. Ultimately he acquired nearly all the company\u2019s publicly available shares \u2014 which soon lost much of their value.\u201cThis was an unfortunate situation where it was missed by two layers of checking,\u201d the local compliance manager testified in arbitration.In 2011, Morgan Stanley began an investigation of Mr. Wyatt\u2019s behavior. That ended with a reprimand for buying stocks on behalf of customers without checking with them first, the Mississippi settlement said.Mr. Wyatt was fired in June 2012 when a lawyer representing one of his clients presented Morgan Stanley with evidence that he had been using a personal email address to push clients to buy investments that he held in his own private accounts.Since then, Mr. Wyatt said, he has been trying to restart his life outside the financial industry. His lawyers did not respond to questions about whether he could face liability in remaining arbitration cases.Mr. Brister continued as a supervisor at Morgan Stanley until this year. The Mississippi settlement says he retired last month. He could not be reached for comment.Ms. Clarke, the 84-year-old client of Mr. Wyatt, said she had assumed Morgan Stanley would reimburse her when she provided it with evidence of how Mr. Wyatt had, in just a few years, lost half of the money her husband left to her when he died.Instead, the company said in arbitration documents that it had \u201cacted in good faith and without knowledge of any wrongdoing or improper activity\u201d in Ms. Clarke\u2019s account. Morgan Stanley said in the documents that Ms. Clarke and others knowingly signed up for an aggressive portfolio with Mr. Wyatt and bore the losses that come with that sort of strategy.Ms. Clarke said she did not remember being asked about what sort of investing strategy she wanted to pursue. She says she left that up to Mr. Wyatt.The settlement this week said that Morgan Stanley did little to check whether Mr. Wyatt\u2019s trading strategies were consistent with his clients\u2019 needs, or to verify the information about them that he put in the company\u2019s database.Looking back, Ms. Clarke said she now recognizes that her mistake was to trust Mr. Wyatt, and to trust Morgan Stanley to monitor him. \u201cI just never questioned that there\u2019d be any monkey business,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cI knew they were a well-known firm.
