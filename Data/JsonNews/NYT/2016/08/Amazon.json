{"Headline": "Hope Solo Struggles in Goal, but U.S. Women\u2019s Soccer Advances", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "Supported byUnited States 2, Colombia 2RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Twenty-five minutes into Tuesday night\u2019s steam bath of a soccer match in the Amazon, Hope Solo stood in front of the United States net, awaiting a free kick by Colombia\u2019s Catalina Usme from about 20 yards away.Usme launched a shot that cleared the wall of United States players and went directly at Solo, who appeared ready to catch the ball against her chest as she fell to her knees. Except that she did not. In one of the more stunning moments in recent years for the United States women\u2019s soccer team, the usually indomitable Solo let the ball slip through her legs and into the net.The blunder, one of the worst of Solo\u2019s long career, gave Colombia a 1-0 lead in a group-stage game that the Americans did not need to win or even tie to advance to the quarterfinals. Still, the mistake was disconcerting for a group seeking to defend its Olympic title from 2012 and add to the luster of its World Cup triumph last summer.As the game progressed, the United States dominated play and recaptured the lead on goals by Crystal Dunn and the 18-year-old Mallory Pugh, but Usme refused to go away.In the 76th minute, with Colombia trailing, 2-1, Usme launched another free kick, this one from further out, and it came close to going into the net, clipping the top of the crossbar just over Solo\u2019s outstretched hand.Thirteen minutes later, Usme had one more chance, on yet another free kick but from an almost impossible angle directly to Solo\u2019s left. Despite the degree of difficulty, Usme launched a curling shot that grazed off the top of Solo\u2019s right hand and, remarkably, right into the net.14 PhotosIt was an impressive feat by Usme, and a questionable moment for Solo, who might have blocked the ball but did not.The outcome was a 2-2 draw that left the Colombian players rejoicing even though they finished last in their group and are going home. For the Americans who rested several players, the score was a blow to their egos and perhaps to Solo\u2019s confidence.Still, the tie allowed the United States to finish first in its group, and it will move on to a quarterfinal match in Bras\u00edlia against Sweden. Many of the American players, including Solo, will be going up against their former coach, Pia Sundhage, who joined Sweden in 2012 after a stint with the United States.Solo did not talk to reporters immediately after Tuesday\u2019s game. She has had a challenging Olympics, booed from the first moments of the first game because of Twitter posts she had made in July. Those posts offended many in Brazil because they appeared to make light of the Zika virus, which can be spread by mosquitoes. One of the posts showed her wearing a beekeeper\u2019s mask, and the other had an array of insect repellents. Brazilians did not think either one was funny.Instead, they have booed Solo whenever she has touched the ball and chanted \u201cZika!\u201d every time she has kicked it downfield. She received that treatment in Belo Horizonte, where the Americans shut out New Zealand and France in the past week, and she got it again Tuesday in Manaus.It is difficult to say whether the jeers have affected Solo. Last Saturday, she was outstanding as the United States won, 1-0, over France, one of the tournament\u2019s tougher teams. Against a much weaker Colombia squad, she was off her game.Solo\u2019s performance Tuesday overshadowed the return of midfielder Megan Rapinoe, who played her first minutes on the field since injuring her knee last December. Rapinoe started, played a little more than 30 minutes and made a couple of deft passes that demonstrated her ability to be the team\u2019s best playmaker.Rapinoe most likely will have a role to play as the team moves into the quarterfinals. And Solo will continue to hear more ridicule from spectators, and she will have to put Tuesday\u2019s game behind her.An earlier version of this article misidentified one of the teams the United States shut out in Belo Horizonte in the past week. It was New Zealand, not Colombia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "London, as You\u2019ve Never Heard It Before", "Date": "2016-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 On a recent Saturday, Ian Rawes, a part-time deliveryman, spent several hours walking around London with two microphones strapped to his head. He went into a vegetable market and got so caught up recording the sound of birds in its rafters that he almost got hit by a cabbage-laden forklift hurtling toward him.He went to a park, only to decide that the stream dribbling through it wasn\u2019t worth recording. Then he headed to Stamford Hill, a traditionally Hasidic Jewish community, where he wove around men in towering fur hats, capturing snatches of their conversations in Yiddish.\u201cA good morning\u2019s work, two more tiny fragments of the mosaic that is London,\u201d he said as he took off the microphones.The thrill of the chase aside, Mr. Rawes says he is performing a vital historical service. \u201cAs time goes by and cultural, technological, economic conditions change, these recordings will become more and more interesting,\u201d he said.\u201cI mean, could you imagine if you could hear the sounds of 18th-century London today?\u201d he said. \u201cEven if it was just the sound of people spitting in the street, coughing \u2014 and a lot of people were sick back then, so it probably would be \u2014 it\u2019d be fascinating.\u201dMr. Rawes was working at the British Library\u2019s sound archive about 10 years ago when he stumbled across tapes of the sounds of every bus route in the county of Yorkshire, complete with dense handwritten notes.\u201cWe\u2019d probably now diagnose the person who made them as on the autism spectrum,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it made me think, \u2018God, if he can do that, there must be something in London to record.\u2019\u201dIt has proved more difficult than expected to find dramatic sounds in London, Mr. Rawes said. \u201cThere are some places you can go, and you\u2019d have to be spectacularly incompetent not to make an interesting recording,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Amazon rain forest at night, for example.\u201dHe added, \u201cIn cities, it\u2019s harder to find great sounds, unless you love the sound of cars.\u201dField recording has a long history. In 1889, an 8-year-old German, Ludwig Koch, made the first known recording of birdsongs using a phonograph that his parents gave him.Musicians have long incorporated such recordings into their work, but Mr. Rawes and others like him are fixated on the raw sounds themselves.Why do people listen to her records? \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s still very difficult for me to go to a dinner party and say, \u2018I compose what\u2019s loosely called music from field recordings.\u2019 It\u2019s not the average way to make a living. But more people are getting interested in nature, and more listen to experimental music, so naturally they discover it.\u201dThe most prominent field recordist today is Chris Watson, a soft-spoken 62-year-old from Sheffield, England, who has won numerous awards including for his work on BBC nature documentaries.Mr. Watson has been making recordings since he was 11, when his parents gave him a reel-to-reel tape recorder, and he left it on a bird feeder to see if he could hear what birds sounded like eating.\u201cI was amazed when I played it back,\u201d he said. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t believe you could eavesdrop onto a world where you could never be yourself. I\u2019m still excited by that idea.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the sound of them rubbing their penises beneath their abdomens to sing to attract females,\u201d Mr. Watson said with a boyish smile. \u201cI love the fact that in this relatively tranquil environment, all that noise is going on below the surface.\u201dAt a recent performance of the town-moor piece in a movie theater in Newcastle, the audience sat in darkness, surrounded by speakers. \u201cIt\u2019s like the old clich\u00e9 that radio is better than television because the pictures are better,\u201d Mr. Watson told the audience. \u201cSound surrounds you. It releases your imagination.\u201dMr. Watson says he seeks to capture the \u201cspirit of places\u201d in his music, but he also sees the world as being filled with breathtaking sounds that instruments cannot reproduce that more people should hear.\u201cEveryone should listen more,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they should just start with what they\u2019ve got. I\u2019ve traveled a lot, but still the most awesome sound I\u2019ve ever heard \u2014 the most beautiful, the most rich, the most musical \u2014 is the blackbirds in my garden.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When the Shop Looks a Lot Like Home", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "Supported bySign of the TimesAs shopping online from the comfort of your home continues its unchecked expansion \u2014 almost $100 billion in online sales in the first quarter of 2016 \u2014 in-store shopping is turning increasingly homey. Beyond the physical space, note the proliferation of amenities that soften the pecuniary nature of the retail experience: At one end of the spectrum, a cup holder on the handlebar of your grocery-store cart; at the other end, silver platters of chilled San Pellegrino at the ready. And since nothing kills the domestic vibe like a wait at the checkout line, the final transaction that punctuates a purchase is currently being remodeled. In a luxury boutique, your credit card is now likely to be whisked away \u2014 the grubby reality of commerce happens out of sight \u2014 only to be discreetly, and somewhat apologetically, returned in a supple leather binder or on a zebrawood tray. In the more democratic Apple store, the exchange is decentralized: Scan your purchase on your phone, then waltz out of the store unassailed. It\u2019s like everything is yours already.While we may, in pursuit of a bargain, suffer the cacophony of Century 21 or allow Ikea to swallow us whole and squeeze us through its labyrinthine intestine, the relationship between the big commercial store and the luxury object is fraught. That ultra-precious handbag tends to hemorrhage aura when set in context of innumerable clones. When luxury goods are offered in a simulated domestic setting, the brutal impersonality of mass production and merchandising is disguised behind the fantasy of exclusivity. Intimacy equals desirability.There was a time when bigness was in. Big meant choice. Big meant entertainment. Big meant the whole world in a box. Malls touted square footage as the metric of shopping exhilaration. Macy\u2019s Herald Square billed itself as the \u201cworld\u2019s largest store.\u201d In the early decades of the last century, shoppers entered the fabled Wanamaker\u2019s department store in Philadelphia through a towering Corinthian portico to browse in a great Roman-Doric court, a fantastical Egyptian hall, and Byzantine, Empire and Art Nouveau period rooms. Merchandise from across the globe was displayed with exhibitions of Old Master paintings and exotic objets d\u2019art. The grand department store was a portal to the world, the commercial twin of the great encyclopedic civic museums, where uplifting and educating the masses was serious business.At the same time, Sears, Roebuck & Co. and Montgomery Ward were delivering bigness to the rural masses through the original home shopping network: consolidated mail-order catalogs, some over 700 pages, that offered everything from button-hooks and brassieres to motor buggies, delivered directly to their customer\u2019s doorstep via the U.S.P.S. An early Sears catalog cover, boasting \u201cOur trade reaches around the world,\u201d featured a fair-skinned maiden, addressed envelope in hand, floating over a bucolic American farmstead astride a cornucopia spilling furniture, guns, pianos and clothing. The mail-order catalog provided nationwide domestic access to a previously unimaginable selection of products. Inventory was king.By the \u201960s, Sears alone reportedly accounted for almost 1 percent of the U.S. gross national product, employed 350,000 people and provided credit cards to over half the population. (The hippie-domestic Whole Earth Catalog was launched as that era\u2019s proto-Brooklyn, D.I.Y. alternative \u2014 the original Etsy.) Fast-forward to the now-familiar narrative of the exurban big-box revolution. Walmart became the world\u2019s largest retailer and QVC and Home Shopping Network began to deliver 24/7 in-home access to cubic zirconium, spot remover and miracle knife sets to anyone with a television and telephone.And then something came along that was bigger than all that came before it, with the real potential to access the whole earth, and everything changed. The internet made shopping the world not only a reality but an essential feature of everyday life for millions of people. Enter global shopping with a hyperlocal interface: as local as your own couch. Amazon has out-bigged the biggest big box \u2014 adding 17 million square feet of warehouse space just last year \u2014 and in achieving such massive scale, fomented the expectation that anything you could possibly need is always in stock, immediately available and just a keystroke away.Now even the keystroke has been disrupted. With the recent innovation of Amazon Dash buttons \u2014 branded clickers that automatically place an order for a specific product \u2014 the home is the interface and the pantry has been outsourced. Out of Tide? Just hit the button on the Dash device, and that familiar orange box will appear on your doorstep in a matter of minutes by way of a friendly union-free drone. As it is estimated that the average American woman uses a mere fraction of her wardrobe and wears a new purchase only a handful of times, that logic of linked distribution will almost certainly spread to your closet. It may be only a matter of time before we have a Chanel Dash button, a Calvin Dash button. Winter clothes storage in the summer? Forget it. Out of style? Just send it back. Same with sizing. Your wardrobe will follow your climate, your body and your mood. All that warehouse space is an extension of your own personal space.As our shelves and closets are sensored for automatic fulfillment, and our pantries communicate directly with the public larders to keep them perpetually brimming with the bounty of American plenty, there will be ever less reason to leave the comfortable confines of our homes. The comprehensive sites such as Amazon and Zappos, and the curated ones like Net-a-Porter and Yoox, provide our great database of commodities. As product research and price comparison are relocated from physical spaces to virtual ones \u2014 it\u2019s called a browser for a reason \u2014 the function of stores shifts from a site of discovery and transaction to something else ... what, exactly, is at the moment hotly contested.Bigness, at least in terms of luxury, seems to be a dwindling proposition. Discovery and selection in the physical world can never match the reach of the internet with its huge-scale aggregators, branded e-commerce shops, curatorial shopping sites, and the long trail of small boutiques and Etsy home-crafters offering anything and everything. What the shop can offer, however, are things difficult to achieve online: an intimate relationship with things, a haptic appreciation of materiality, a personal interaction with a sympathetic helper, an experience that contextualizes objects, a place to socialize with like-minded connoisseurs and, most importantly, a respite from the avalanche of too much stuff. Consider that the much-vaunted Apple store, which has the highest profit per-square-foot of any store in the United States, essentially offers variants of four products: telephone, watch, music player and laptop. In an ironic reversal, stores now may have to offer less to stay relevant.If we\u2019ve become used to, and adept at, shopping from bed, and as our homes are increasingly conjoined to distant warehouses that monitor their status, shops themselves may become extensions of the social function of our domestic space. As simple fulfillment of household commodities becomes automated, browsing, research and cost comparison become the prelude to shopping, not its raison d\u2019\u00eatre. A visit to the store may revert back to John Wanamaker\u2019s original dream: shopping as a form of education and cultural edification. Maybe we learn best in the places that we feel most comfortable in: places that feel like our own living room, only nicer.Oh, and whatever happened to Wanamaker\u2019s? In Manhattan, the gargantuan old department store now houses a corporate headquarters ... for Facebook.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "1.28 Billion Minutes Streamed (and NBC Is Still Counting)", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTV SportsSTAMFORD, Conn. \u2014 NBC Sports\u2019 promise to stream every sport live at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro is fulfilled here at its headquarters \u2014 a former Clairol factory \u2014 where the digital feeds from every event are sent to tablets, computers, smartphones and other connected devices. They are visible on flat screens throughout the vast broadcast operations center \u2014 mosaics of sports that are being played simultaneously.Streaming is a part of NBC\u2019s Olympic future \u2014 an extension and repudiation of a history in which the prime-time broadcast was not to be trifled with. But the new model is unfolding in Rio: unfettered live streaming of all events and live Olympic programming on NBCUniversal\u2019s cable networks, combined with NBC\u2019s traditional prime-time broadcast, which has live and taped elements.Through Thursday, NBC\u2019s live streaming had reached 1.28 billion minutes \u2014 more than in all of the 2012 London Olympics. The minutes have helped NBC add the equivalent of a few hundred thousand viewers to a prime-time broadcast audience that has fallen since 2012. Still, NBC\u2019s streaming is less than halfway to the 2.6 billion live minutes that ESPN streamed during the 2014 World Cup.\u201cGoing past one billion minutes \u2014 I\u2019m impressed, excited and overjoyed,\u201d said Eric Black, the chief technology officer of NBC Sports Group Digital, who has watched Olympic streaming advance, sometimes fitfully, over several Olympics. He recalled an unexpectedly large surge of streaming during the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, for the men\u2019s United States-Russia preliminary-round game in hockey, at 7:30 a.m. Eastern.\u201cWe expected an O.K. crowd, but it went viral, and went to a shootout,\u201d he said. \u201cThe numbers rose dramatically, and we had to add more video sources to back it up.\u201d Nearly 600,000 unique users streamed the game, the most in Olympic hockey\u2019s short online viewing history.16 PhotosSo far in Rio, that number has been eclipsed by five streams: two from swimming, the opening ceremony (which was not shown live), and the women\u2019s gymnastics all-around final (1.16 million) and team final (1.35 million).By comparison, the average World Cup game on ESPN two years ago averaged about 900,000 unique users.Chris Reed, a freelance writer and publicist in Los Angeles, said in an interview Friday that he had been streaming gymnastics live in the afternoon on his tablet because he was unwilling to wait until NBC showed it on a tape delay on the West Coast.\u201cTake gymnastics yesterday,\u201d he said, referring to the all-around final won by Simone Biles of the United States. \u201cDo I stay up until midnight to see how they did and avoid all social media, or watch it live? The answer was to watch it live and celebrate with the rest of the country.\u201dStreaming has become an essential way to view sports and entertainment as people change the way they consume media: cutting the cords to their subscriptions with satellite, cable and telephone companies; binge-watching new series on internet services like Netflix and Amazon; and choosing mobile devices for watching the sports that they (or their parents) once tuned in to their televisions for.The NBC building is in full Olympics mode, and not only for streaming. It is a bustling northern outpost of the International Broadcast Center in Rio. One of its large studios is filled with portable announcing and production booths where announcers call many of the sports NBC is showing, from archery and badminton to rugby and weight lifting. They describe the action using video feeds from Rio with the ambient sounds of the venues piped to their headsets. In one quirk of the setup, Mary Carillo calls tennis from the broadcast center in Brazil; one of her partners, Rennae Stubbs, speaks from one of the booths in Stamford; and a reporter works on site at the tennis arena.Black and his staff spend much of their time making sure the live streams run without serious glitches, a task that was largely unheard-of when he began working in the early 2000s as the webmaster at WNBC-TV\u2019s website in New York. \u201cWe pointed a camera at the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree \u2014 it was like Yule log \u2014 and people watched it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you think about it, that was pretty advanced for 2002.\u201dOn a wall in Black\u2019s office is a large heat map \u2014 its colors ranging from pale yellow to dark orange \u2014 that shows the number of concurrent video feeds scheduled, in 15-minute intervals, to be streamed or televised by the NBC networks carrying the Rio Games every day. The peak was reached last Saturday when about 50 feeds were live simultaneously, 40 of them streams produced by the Olympics\u2019 world broadcaster.\u201cMy 5-year-old godson loves it that Uncle Eric makes it possible to watch soccer on the iPhone,\u201d Black said.Although he is a devoted fan of New York teams and of boxing, his job has led him to redefine what his favorite sports are.They are, he said, \u201cthe streams that start and end successfully.\u201dHe added, \u201cAfter we streamed our first Super Bowl, I had no idea who won.\u201dBut those who stream often care, some quite deeply, in a world where people want to be entertained on demand \u2014 and buffering of the live hammer throw or trouble signing on to NBCOlympics.com can be causes for an angry tweet.Email: sandor@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Walmart Is Said to Be in Talks to Acquire Jet.com", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJet.com was born out of a dream of taking on Amazon and its grip on the world of e-commerce. But the online discount retailer may instead be poised for a humbling sale to the biggest traditional store chain around.Jet.com is in talks to sell itself to Walmart, two people briefed on the matter said on Wednesday. The talks are continuing and may not lead to a deal.The discussions are an acknowledgment of the tough reality of America\u2019s $350 billion e-commerce market, which has for years been dominated by Amazon. While plenty of competitors \u2014 including physical retailers and online start-ups \u2014 have tried to take on Amazon with strategies like focusing only on specific niches of the market or having flash sales, none have succeeded.From offices in Hoboken, N.J., Jet.com tried to chart a different course in the e-commerce market. It attacked Amazon directly, seeking to build a national network of warehouses while offering a similarly broad selection of goods. But it also sought to undercut Amazon on price, using complex formulas that adjust the cost of items based on factors like the quantity of products bought at once. For an annual membership fee of $50, Jet.com consumers could get access to goods priced 10 to 15 percent less than anywhere else on the web.Mr. Lore also tried to make Jet.com different from other start-ups at the workplace. Most start-ups try to bend a reluctant universe to their will, which means employees sweat 12-hour days and seven-day weeks. Private lives go by the wayside. But Jet promoted itself as a start-up with a difference: one focused on employee well-being.His approach in e-commerce and the workplace may have seemed quixotic, but Mr. Lore succeeded in raising more than $500 million from many investors, including venture capital firms like New Enterprise Associates and the mutual fund company Fidelity. Jet.com quickly gained a valuation of roughly $1 billion.Along the way, it was hailed as a particularly ambitious \u201cunicorn,\u201d the once-ballyhooed class of Silicon Valley start-ups valued at $1 billion or more.A month later, after Jet.com had finished a fund-raising round, Mr. Lore said: \u201cIt was challenging. The market conditions have turned, and there is a lot of negative press around private company financing. The fact that we got it done was on the back of the company\u2019s performance.\u201dFor Walmart, pursuing Jet.com in what would be one of its biggest takeovers, a deal would help the retailer reproduce its off-line dominance in the online world. The Bentonville, Ark., company has pumped millions of dollars into efforts to expand its e-commerce business, such as offering more items online and expanding locations for its grocery pickup service.At the end of 2015, Walmart had about eight million items available at Walmart.com. That\u2019s now up to 10 million. Four years ago, it was under two million, Walmart has said. The retailer does not break out a quarterly figure for online sales, but it said its e-commerce business had grown 7 percent in the last quarter.Walmart recently announced a two-day subscription shipping service for $49, its version of Amazon\u2019s $99 annual Prime membership. Walmart is also trying to take advantage of its position as the nation\u2019s largest grocer, nearly tripling the number of markets where customers can order groceries and pick up curbside.Jet\u2019s model of encouraging bulk buying would complement Walmart in areas where the retailer has lagged, according to Neil Saunders, a retail analyst with Conlumino, a research and consulting firm.A decade ago, consumers might have been more inclined to stop at Walmart for household items like toilet paper and laundry detergent in \u201cfairly reasonable quantities\u201d and pick up other items while they were there, Mr. Saunders said.\u201cWhat\u2019s happened, though, with these online sites is that people first of all are much more likely to buy in bulk because they can get better deals,\u201d he said.Reporting was contributed by David Streitfeld, Rachel Abrams, Leslie Picker and Katie Benner.Advertisement"}

The online business grew just 7 percent last quarter, a number that Doug McMillon, the company\u2019s president and chief executive, acknowledged at the time was \u201ctoo slow.\u201d Most recently, the company has focused much of its online strategy on expanding its curbside grocery pickup business.Jet is perhaps best known for an algorithm that encourages bulk buying, an area where Walmart.com has fallen short and could energize its sagging online growth.Walmart said Jet offered it access to \u201curban and millennial customers,\u201d two groups that the retailer\u2019s large rural footprint has been slow to attract. Walmart said on Monday that Jet had added more than 400,000 users monthly.Jet says it uses a complex formula to offer items 10 to 15 percent less than competitors by adjusting prices based on the quantity of products bought at once. The company relies heavily on suppliers, and Walmart offers more pricing power and potentially better distribution operations through its vast network of warehouses across the country.Still, the $3.3 billion figure is eye-popping, given that Jet.com started selling products barely a year ago.Walmart is not valuing Jet.com solely based on traditional metrics like profitability, which the start-up does not have. The retailer is spending billions in cash and stock in large part for something \u2014 or someone \u2014 else: Marc Lore. Mr. Lore, a serial e-commerce entrepreneur who started Jet.com, is seen as one of the few executives who can help put a dent in Amazon\u2019s edge.\u201cIf you looked at Jet from a fundamentals perspective, the company wouldn\u2019t be worth what they\u2019re paying for it,\u201d said Anand Sanwal, the chief executive of CB Insights, a research firm covering venture capital. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to inject Marc and probably some of the veterans on his team, and try and help Walmart figure this out.\u201dMr. Lore, 46, will take over responsibility for Walmart.com in the United States and will continue running Jet, which will operate separately, Mr. McMillon said in a call with reporters. Walmart will be \u201cthoughtful\u201d about how it merges the two companies, and will focus on expanding both brands in the short-term, he said.Mr. Lore will replace Walmart\u2019s current top e-commerce executive, Neil Ashe, who will leave the company. Mr. McMillon said that now was the \u201cnatural inflection point\u201d for a leadership change and praised Mr. Ashe for doing an \u201coutstanding\u201d job building the company\u2019s online business.Mr. Lore co-founded a company, Quidsi, that grew into a collection of e-commerce websites, including Diapers.com and Soap.com. The company was sold to Amazon in 2010 for more than $500 million. He stayed at Amazon for two years, then left to figure out a new project.Investors lined up to back Mr. Lore on his next venture, Jet.com. He raised more than $200 million before the company sold a single product, and more than $500 million over all. In the latest funding in November, the company was valued at $1.5 billion, according to data compiled by CB Insights.He is seen as someone who can bring a unique approach when it comes to e-commerce, according to Adam Silverman, an analyst at Forrester, a research firm.\u201cMarc has been a creative force within the industry, creating pretty innovative business models, including Jet.com,\u201d Mr. Silverman said in a phone interview. \u201cHe\u2019s proven that he can create businesses from scratch, and Walmart needs a bit of that entrepreneurship within their e-commerce business.\u201dConnecting with Walmart could help Jet.com amplify its business without the stress of private fund-raising in a market that has become more challenging for unprofitable companies.Walmart said that while it would incorporate some of Jet\u2019s ideas and talent into Walmart.com, Jet would remain a separate brand, too. Yet both sites will continue to face a daunting reality: Amazon.com continues to wallop the competition.Amazon does more business online than any other retailer, yet still reports double-digit growth. In 2015, Amazon reported that net product sales rose 13 percent to $79.3 billion, while Walmart reported that global annual e-commerce revenue had risen 12 percent, to $13.7 billion, in its latest fiscal year.For Walmart, buying Jet may not be about beating Amazon at its own game, according to Charlie O\u2019Shea, the lead retail analyst for Moody\u2019s.\u201cWe view this as a race for second,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Shea said. \u201cAmazon\u2019s lead is so great that it\u2019s going to be virtually impossible to catch them, but you can compete with them.\u201dWhile legacy retailers continue to struggle with how best to compete online, e-commerce represents only 8 percent of all sales, Mr. O\u2019Shea said.\u201cAll Walmart has to do is be better than the other brick-and-mortar guys,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Time Warner Deal Gives Hulu a Much-Needed $580 Million Lift", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsTime Warner\u2019s willingness to serve as sous-chef in Hulu\u2019s crowded kitchen could keep the broth from spoiling.Hulu, the digital TV service, will get $580 million from Time Warner, the American media conglomerate, and fresh programs from its TNT and CNN networks. Notably, however, Time Warner will hold a smaller stake in Hulu than other major investors and refrain from joining a board already crowded by rivals like Walt Disney, 21st Century Fox and Comcast.Hulu has charted a rocky path since it was started in 2007. Owners clashed over competing ideas and agendas, including trying to protect lucrative fees collected by cable operators to carry their networks. Twice, the service has been put up for sale. A private equity backer sold out. Comcast\u2019s involvement was hamstrung by regulators as part of its acquisition of NBC Universal. Along the way, Hulu lost its highly regarded chief executive.Despite the turmoil, Hulu has benefited from consumers who are increasingly watching TV shows and movies when they want and on devices of their choosing. Hulu has quadrupled the number of paying customers in four years to 12 million, pulling in at least $1.2 billion from those on the lowest plan at $8 a month. That does not include advertising revenue, which Credit Suisse estimates will be $850 million this year.Time Warner\u2019s 10 percent stake, at a $5.8 billion valuation for Hulu, precedes a planned introduction of Hulu\u2019s live-streaming service next year. That feature will distinguish it from rivals like Amazon and Netflix, which trades at a higher multiple of sales than Hulu does based on its new investment. For now, only shows from the Turner networks will be available, though there are discussions about adding ones from Time Warner\u2019s HBO, home to the hit \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201dHulu will pay Time Warner for the shows, in much the same way that traditional cable companies pay fees to Time Warner. In that sense, at least some of the money from Time Warner will boomerang back to it. Jeffrey Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, emphasized on Wednesday that his company\u2019s investment would give Hulu more programming firepower. Doing so without muscling in too much on the operations may give the joint venture a better shot at success.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How a Bird Feeder Revived My Marriage", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveMy husband was no longer the man I had married. He had become grumpy and short-tempered, acting as if life had dealt him a bad hand.He works in publishing, an industry that has its own share of problems. A self-made man, he worries that our sons have been handed too much. Our marriage was facing the familiar strains of midlife. All of this was getting him down.Until he installed the bird feeder.\u201cBut that\u2019s so messy,\u201d I said. In Mumbai, India, where we live, apartments are tiny. And while we have a little veranda with a few green plants, we do not have birds, and I did not see the point of putting up a bird feeder on our small open space to feed nonexistent creatures.To try to feed birds in a city that\u2019s rife with starvation and poverty also seemed too privileged and romantic a notion, something only rich people did in the Western world. Not here. Not in Mumbai.\u201cWe live in India,\u201d I reminded him.\u201cBirds belong to the world,\u201d he replied. And that was that.So up it went, an ugly contraption he bought on Amazon and had shipped to us. It was transparent, cylindrical and odd-looking. Grain was dutifully filled, and I watched skeptically as it stood solitary and defiant on our veranda in the muggy monsoon weather in a city where I neither saw birds fly nor come to roost.Our lives were busy with the inevitable commotion that forms the basis of any marriage today. We worked hard. We spoke less. We watched too much television. We spent many evenings answering emails and responding to texts. Our sons were grown-up and had their own lives. We had ours.One lonely morning in a long succession of lonely mornings, I caught my husband\u2019s eye over the newspaper. He was signaling to me in that grotesque, animated fashion adults use to convey something unspoken through improvised sign language, pointing to our little veranda.I turned. And there it was: a bright green parrot with a red beak perched on the ledge of the bird feeder. The parrot cocked his head. We cocked ours. The parrot studied us. We studied him. And then he settled down and dug right in.I glanced at my husband. He beamed in response. He looked as if he had just given birth.And soon our mornings became a bit more than the rush to catch the bus. There was anticipation to our workday until our winged visitors would arrive. One morning, a cocky sparrow came to us.\u201cDid you know they are almost extinct in this city?\u201d my husband whispered.We waited to see which feathered friend would drop in next. Who would be vying for top spot? Who would win the day?\u201cSo you think it\u2019s too tiny, the entrance?\u201d my husband asked me one evening.I looked at the doorway to our apartment, puzzled, only to realize that he meant the entrance to the bird feeder. \u201cWell, they have tiny beaks,\u201d I muttered. \u201cThey don\u2019t need a granary.\u201dHe looked contemplative, as if he were seriously considering my response. \u201cBut it helps when you have a wider plate on the dining table, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d he said.\u201cThat\u2019s a little sunbird!\u201d I exclaimed with disbelief. \u201cIn Mumbai!\u201dAnd suddenly the grumpy man\u2019s face lit up, his stress lines disappearing. Could this be a new him?He would measure the level of the grain with great care and fill the feeder.\u201cOh, no,\u201d he would exclaim with dismay. \u201cThey did not eat today.\u201d But he was not referring to our sons, whom we seldom saw, or to any human beings. He meant the birds. Everything was about his feathered friends.Our mornings became the hours I most looked forward to. We exchanged far more than a glance. It was like the intrepid excitement of opening our doors to strangers or new friends and having a meal ready. Will they come? Will the food be enough? Will they enjoy their dinner and come back for more?One evening, I came home to find my husband sitting with little bowls of different grains of different textures. \u201cThis food is very good for the birds,\u201d he said as the grains slipped though his fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s good for their digestion.\u201dI watched the sifting grains, thinking: What\u2019s next?He spent many a Sunday on the internet researching birds, bird food and eating patterns. When do they feed? How much? Why so little?Our conversations often began with a bird fact. A male songbird sings 2,000 times a day, for example. A pigeon\u2019s feathers outweigh its bones.At night, my husband took stock of his day by keeping track of how many birds had visited and for how long.One very windy Sunday, as we both gazed out from our little veranda, he seemed pensive. \u201cIs it your job?\u201d I asked anxiously, eager to help.\u201cNo,\u201d he said, glaring at me for being so hopelessly insensitive. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a bird visit in the last 24 hours. I\u2019ve been watching.\u201d\u201cPerhaps it needs a GPS tracker,\u201d I said jokingly. I mean, they were just birds. I was the wife.That evening, I found that he had moved the bird feeder to another location.\u201cIt\u2019s easier for them to find it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to be comfortable. After all, they come to eat.\u201dCan you be jealous of birds? They commanded his attention more than I did. I began glaring at the pigeons and muttering cuss words at the noisy crow. \u201cYou are upstaging me,\u201d I muttered to the cooing dove.Sea gulls gave me the eye, and I was suspicious of the eagle that swooped too low. I felt like Cruella de Vil from Disney\u2019s \u201c101 Dalmatians,\u201d devious plotter and coldhearted criminal. I was coming in the way of their happiness. And his.As I cleaned up after dinner one evening, I thought of the food on our table, feeling grateful for all we have in a country where malnourishment is rampant. \u201cFinish what\u2019s in front of you,\u201d I used to snap at my sons. \u201cAnd no, you have to eat what\u2019s at home, not order a pizza again.\u201dOne morning while my husband was away, I sat in my little nook nursing a coffee. My father had been hospitalized, and I was inundated with work and a pressing deadline. The hopelessness of life kept creeping up on me. I wiped my tears in anger and gazed at the bird feeder, which was now an out-of-focus blur.Someone cocked his head around the feeder. It was my friend the parrot. Or rather, my husband\u2019s friend.Well, tough luck, pal, I thought. There\u2019s just me to contend with today.He stared at me. I stared back. We seemed to be playing a silly game of who blinks first. I moved closer, but he didn\u2019t budge.He continued eating in little bites from the bird feeder as I inched closer. And just when I could see him up close in his magnificent finery, he looked at me sideways and a little crossly. Keep your distance, he threatened.And for once I listened. I watched the bird eat and fill his tummy. I imagined his pleasure. I shared in his contentment. If he were able to roll onto his back and rub his belly, he would have.It was such a simple joy. Such a simple kindness. I smiled as fresh tears threatened to spill again.That night, I snuggled close to my once-grumpy man and held his hand tight.\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d he asked.\u201cYes,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI shared a meal with your friend today.\u201dThese days, my husband smiles more and grumbles less. He now looks at the trees in the neighborhood and talks about how important they are.\u201cFor the birds, you mean?\u201d\u201cFor us,\u201d he says quietly.And perhaps that\u2019s it. You reach a stage in life when you yearn to do something new. You yearn to do something good. To give back. To find yourself. To rediscover love. In order to live better.Some nurture a hobby. Others donate to charity. A few travel the world or volunteer to teach. The wealthy may take themselves out for elaborate meals or on a trip to an exotic city, where they can dance in the rain or go bungee-jumping or learn to speak Mandarin.My husband did none of those things. He visited none of those places. Didn\u2019t tick off items on his bucket list.But he found himself anyway. And in doing so, he found us. All he did was go online and order an ugly bird feeder. And it has made all the difference.Tista Sen lives in Mumbai, India, where she works as national creative director at the J.

{"Headline": "When Every Company Is a Tech Company, Does the Label Matter?", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesApple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon have created something of a watershed moment in the stock market.They became the four most valuable companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index at the close of trading on Aug. 1, according to S.&P.\u2019s official tally. That meant that tech companies, by one common definition, occupied the four top spots in the market capitalization rankings, a rare and brief occurrence.\u201cIt may never have happened before at the close of trading,\u201d said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. The full history of daily rankings isn\u2019t readily available, however, so we can\u2019t be certain, and such rankings are evanescent, shifting with every tick of the stock market. In fact, on Friday, Amazon dropped back into sixth place.But no matter: The early August rankings were a reminder of how far tech has come. It is a dominant force in the stock market and the economy, one so all-encompassing that tech may no longer even be a useful concept for understanding today\u2019s stock market.One of them is Exxon Mobil, the energy giant and the most valuable company in the S.&P. as recently as 2012. But Exxon Mobil has been cut down in size by the oil price debacle. The other is Berkshire Hathaway, Warren E. Buffett\u2019s conglomerate, which the S.&P. categorizes as a financial services company \u2014 the only such company left in the Top 10 market cap list. Berkshire announced its own earnings after trading closed on Friday. We\u2019ll soon learn whether the market is pleased enough to vault Berkshire further ahead of Amazon.The three tech companies at the very top in market cap \u2014 Apple, Google and Microsoft \u2014 have held high positions for a long while. (Google, ranked second, trades as Alphabet, the name of its parent company.) Google passed Apple in value briefly this year, but Apple regained the top perch, which it has held since 2012. Microsoft, now No. 3, was the most valuable company during the last tech boom, in the early 2000s.Virtually no one disputes S.&P.\u2019s formal classification of Apple, Google and Microsoft as \u201cinformation technology\u201d companies. The same is true of Facebook, which held seventh place in the latest list of most valuable companies. But while Amazon is often described as a tech company \u2014 and undoubtedly uses and creates innovative technology \u2014 S.&P. has never classified it as one.In fact, Amazon is formally known as a \u201cconsumer discretionary company,\u201d like Walmart, which it has displaced as a member of the Top 10 most valuable companies. Amazon is the only consumer discretionary company left in the Top 10. Is it in some sense a tech company? Certainly, and we\u2019ll get back to that.But the same can be said, to one degree or another, about the three other members of the Top 10 \u2014 old companies that are still prospering in large part because of their mastery of advanced technologies. Johnson & Johnson, for example, which is ranked eighth, is a health care company, yet it is heavily involved in technology of a biological kind. Then there is General Electric, the diversified industrial company (and, until recently, also a financial services company), once described as a bellwether for the entire market. It conducts advanced research and sells tech products.Last on the list is AT&T, a telecommunications company, which, in an early form, helped create computer languages and operating systems on which modern tech companies are built. In 1957, when the S.&P. 500 was born, an ancestral version of AT&T was the most valuable company in the United States by a very wide margin, said Jeremy J. Siegel, a Wharton business school professor, the author of \u201cStocks for the Long Run\u201d and a market historian.\u201cAT&T back then was a highly regulated old phone company,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a giant, later broken up into smaller companies. And it was an outlier, because the other big companies in the S.&P. 500 in that era were mainly materials companies \u2014 like United States Steel, DuPont and Union Carbide \u2014 and an awful lot of oil companies.\u201dIn 1957, the economy ran on oil, and the biggest energy company was Standard Oil of New Jersey \u2014 an ancestor of Exxon Mobil. No pure tech company ranked in the Top 10 back then, not even IBM, which soon became the dominant tech company, a position it held until Microsoft surpassed it in the mid-1990s. That was the decade of the great tech boom, culminating in the bubble that burst in March 2000. Microsoft was No. 1 in market cap at the end of 1999, and four other tech companies \u2014 Cisco Systems, Intel, IBM and America Online \u2014 were also among the Top 10 most valuable companies. The stock market celebrated tech\u2019s ascendance then, as it does now.But this is a different era. When you dig deeper into the S.&P. 500, it\u2019s clear that while the valuations of tech companies swelled to unrealistically high proportions in those bubble years, the valuations of most companies are far more modest now. In March 2000, the height of the bubble, the value of information technology companies swelled to 34.5 percent of the total market cap of the S.&P. 500. At the moment, the comparable figure is only 20.7 percent, data from the Bespoke Investment Group shows. That\u2019s not much more than the 15.7 percent share of financial companies or the 15.2 percent share of the health care sector. By contrast, finance ballooned as high as 22.3 percent at the end of 2006, in what can be seen in hindsight as a financial bubble.On the other hand, materials and energy companies, which together constituted almost half of the total value of the S.&P. 500 in 1957, now account for less than 10 percent of it. That reflects the collapse of energy and commodity prices over the last few years, and it may well be a temporary phenomenon. In the meantime, diversified energy companies like Exxon Mobil are investing heavily in technology, a necessity if they are to flourish.It\u2019s clear even to energy companies, in other words, that tech\u2019s abiding power in the marketplace is not temporary. Technology permeates every sector of the economy, even those not formally classified as high-tech. Whether companies like Amazon and Johnson & Johnson should carry tech labels is beside the point. Tech has already taken over.These days every company is a tech company, but some have better niches, faster growth, more attractive offerings or more favorable share prices than others. These kinds of fundamental distinctions will influence the Top 10 rankings of the future.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

He is not so much credulous as excitable, given to interrupting the prose of researchers and analysts with flights of poetry. He tries to press some of them to predict the future, something scientists are generally reluctant to do. And he poses a question that charms and stumps many of them: \u201cDoes the internet dream of itself?\u201dAs its title suggests, \u201cLo and Behold\u201d is to some extent Mr. Herzog\u2019s dream of the internet. Divided into 10 brief chapters, it is impressionistic rather than comprehensive. Many of the ideas are familiar, and some important aspects of life in the digital era are examined superficially or not at all. Though Edward Snowden\u2019s name is dropped, there is not much attention to surveillance or spying, and the uses and abuses of connectivity as a tool of corporate and state power are barely explored.But another way to look at \u201cLo and Behold\u201d is not as an inquiry into ideas but rather as a collection of interesting human specimens. The deepest source of wonder for Mr. Herzog has always been the particular amalgamation of vanity, folly, bravery and genius that makes every individual unique. He is a patient listener with an ability to nudge his subjects off their internal scripts, and like his other documentaries, this one is full of strange, small moments of unanticipated revelation.Whether he is quizzing networking pioneers \u2014 men around his own age who still marvel at having been present at the creation \u2014 or listening to the testimony of \u201cmodern-day hermits\u201d living off the grid and away from pervasive electromagnetic radiation, Mr. Herzog communicates compassion and astonishment in equal measure. The internet is an elusive quarry. It\u2019s a marvel and a menace, a banal fact of life and a force for incalculable change. But it\u2019s also less the subject of this captivating, uneven film than an excuse for its director to add to his collection of memorable faces and voices.\u201cLo and Behold, Reveries of the Connected World\u201d is not rated.

{"Headline": "Jeers Don\u2019t Bother Hope Solo as United States Wins Rio Opener", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "Supported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Just nine minutes into the United States women\u2019s soccer team\u2019s Olympic opener Wednesday night, Carli Lloyd headed in an arcing shot that eluded the New Zealand goalkeeper and gave the United States a 1-0 lead.It was an immediate echo from last year\u2019s World Cup final, in which Lloyd scored in the third, fifth and 16th minutes as part of a four-goal onslaught that helped produce a 5-2 victory over Japan, as well as national acclaim and a ticker-tape parade in Manhattan.But on Wednesday, not much happened after Lloyd scored. The Americans dominated play, but except for a nice passing sequence that set up Alex Morgan for the second and final goal of the game early in the second half, they had trouble creating a sustained offense.Instead, what was most notable about the 2-0 victory was the vociferous jeering that the American goalie Hope Solo received when she handled the ball or kicked it. Solo was apparently paying the price for the public comments and Twitter posts she has made in connection with the mosquito-borne Zika virus, which has plagued Brazil.Earlier this year, Solo said she might not take part in the Olympics because of the virus. She ultimately decided that she would, but more recently she put up a couple of Twitter posts that seemed to take a flippant attitude toward the problem. One post showed a picture of Solo in what looked like a beekeeper\u2019s mask. Another showed an assortment of repellents spread out on a bed.And while Solo took a much different tone before Wednesday\u2019s game, expressing sympathy for the people of Brazil and saying she would not want to offend anyone who lives there, the modest-size crowd in the Mineir\u00e3o in Belo Horizonte let her have it anyway, even eventually yelling \u201cZika!\u201d when she would kick the ball downfield.Afterward, Solo, who has had a controversial career and is still involved in a domestic violence case, tried to shrug off the treatment she had just received.\u201cThey\u2019re having fun,\u201d she told NBC when asked about the fans. \u201cAt least it\u2019s loud in the stadium. I\u2019d rather have that than hear a needle drop.\u201dSolo, herself, did not have all that much to do in the game. New Zealand had some corner kicks but never a moment when it had a dangerous shot on net.Instead, Solo spent most of the game observing an American team that took the field with a lot of familiar faces from last year\u2019s World Cup, but with some new players, too \u2014 midfielder Allie Long and forward Mallory Pugh, 18.Pugh, however, had trouble generating scoring threats and eventually was replaced up front by another newcomer \u2014 Crystal Dunn, who had a more significant impact on the game.Megan Rapinoe, who has yet to play since ripping up her right knee in December, did not get on the field. The veteran Rapinoe is the most creative playmaker on the American team, and her absence seemed to be felt in those extended moments when the United States had trouble launching a coherent attack. At some point, Coach Jill Ellis will presumably need her, but not yet, it appears.Next up for the United States, meanwhile, is a game on Saturday against France, a tough opponent. Then comes their final game of the first round, against Colombia, on Aug. 9, in the Amazon. It\u2019s possible the jeers might follow Solo all the way there.Earlier, Sweden edged South Africa, 1-0, in another Group E game, but most of the seats did not appear to be filled. Nilla Fischer scored the only goal of that game.In a Group F game at Arena Corinthians in S\u00e3o Paulo, Janine Beckie of Canada took only 20 seconds to make a mark on her third Summer Games, scoring the fastest goal ever at the Olympics in a 2-0 victory over Australia.

{"Headline": "In Brazil, Where Men\u2019s Soccer Once Was King, the Women\u2019s Game Rules", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySports of The TimesMANAUS, Brazil \u2014 Late Tuesday evening, as the Amazon temperature danced at 90 degrees with humidity in step, Janine van Wyk, a defender with South Africa\u2019s women\u2019s soccer team, paused just a second to take in the packed and throbbing Amaz\u00f4nia Arena, filled with 43,000 gloriously nuts fans.She thought to herself, \u201cThis is amazing, to realize that all these people are supporting the women\u2019s game,\u201d she told me later. \u201cThis lets younger girls everywhere know our sport is growing.\u201dShe flashed a quick smile even though her team had just been knocked out of the Olympic tournament.The wheels of change are turning in what Brazilians freely describe as their macho society. Their men\u2019s team collapsed in a heap in the World Cup two years ago and continues to play with a listlessness and diffidence in these Olympics. (Manauaras, the locals here, say the male players \u201care walking on high heels,\u201d which means, roughly and after consultation with eminent linguists, \u201carrogant snots.\u201d)The women\u2019s game \u2014 the Brazilian women in particular, but with applause left over for foreign teams as well \u2014 has captured the collective imagination here. As a colleague, Tania Franco, and I wandered around Manaus before the game, and later as we walked through the stands, the sense was that this nation\u2019s enraptured, besotted relationship with soccer had finally lapped over onto the women\u2019s side.Much of this is owed to the Brazilian women\u2019s players, who kick and run with an artful joie de vivre, offering ankle-breaking stutter steps and swashbuckling kicks. Marta, the ponytailed star long known as the Pel\u00e9 of the women\u2019s game, spent too much of her career as a soccer prophet without much honor in her own country. Now she hears loud applause every time her foot touches the ball.15 PhotosWe came upon Danyelle Christine da Silva Beleza, 14, standing and jumping and cheering in this stadium, which was built at fantastical cost and sits like a massive white orb astride northern Manaus. Her family and their neighbors\u2019 family had taken two cars and driven from Rond\u00f4nia to Manaus for this game. That sounds easy enough; a map shows mileage roughly equivalent to the seven-and-a-half-hour trip from New York City to Cleveland. Except that they traversed a \u201chighway\u201d that had been closed for 30 years and that remained a dirt track through the Amazon jungle. The two families bounced and jostled for 14 hours.No matter. They wanted to see the women play.\u201cBrazil is a macho-man society; it is wonderful this is changing,\u201d Danyelle said, beaming. \u201cI want Marta\u2019s jersey instead of Neymar\u2019s.\u201dAs it happened, the Brazilian women could not deliver a grand victory on Tuesday night. The South African women, by their own admission playing over their heads in the drive-a-stake-through-the-eye heat, held the Brazilians to a 0-0 tie.A similar fate befell the favored American women in their game here on Tuesday as the Colombian women, riding two brilliant free kicks by Catalina Usme, a striker with a ponytail Mohawk, tied the score at 2-2.Both games were accompanied by asterisks. The Brazilian and American teams were already assured of spots in the next round, and their coaches were not willing to watch key players melt into puddles in the Amazonian heat. So some key players sat; others played part of the game. Marta played only in the second half, and only because another player came up lame at halftime.\u201cI wanted to spare Marta this heat,\u201d the Brazilian coach, Vad\u00e3o, said. \u201cIf I got her hurt here. \u2026\u201dHe allowed that thought to trail off unspoken, no doubt figuring that had Marta gone down, he\u2019d have had to take up residency under an assumed name in a distant corner of the Amazon.The American coach, Jill Ellis, offered a wry, are-you-kidding look when asked if her players had slowed toward the end of their game. \u201cYeah, I would challenge anyone to run around in that heat,\u201d she said.Solo tried to backtrack. She began tweeting photos of the sunset over the Amazon. That fooled no one. She has been jeered since the Olympics began, and a boom of boos lowered on her every time she touched the ball on Tuesday. As she ran off the field at the half, she was washed over by chants of \u201cZika! Zika!\u201dChristiane Luizedo was one of those lustful booers. \u201cWe know that some people see Brazil as a third-world country,\u201d she said. \u201cShe has disrespected our nation. Now she has to deal with the consequences.\u201dThat Solo had one of the worst games of her career was occasion for paroxysms of joy. Although, in truth, that anger did not feel deep. More striking was the newfound support for the women. Wandering through downtown Manaus, a place of pastel-colored, colonial-age buildings and perpetually busy markets that is ringed by a forest of office towers, I heard again and again a respect mixed with chagrin that fans had taken so long to embrace the women\u2019s game.Renato Andrade da Silva, a cabdriver, had the Olympics playing on a tiny screen in his cab as he hurtled through traffic. That night\u2019s game was must-see television.\u201cThe women are such a great surprise, and the men, not so much,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to like the men more; that was my mistake.\u201dAt a cafe in a baroque old opera house, I spoke with the barista Marcelo Gadhella, 30. \u201cThe women should be given a lot more credit,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the men deserve less credit.\u201dAt a nearby table, Karen Marinho, 25, nodded. She is an aspiring archaeologist and loves the women\u2019s game. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of women nowadays who go to watch, and they bring their spouses,\u201d she said. \u201cThe macho men say: \u2018Oh! Now the women play like little men.\u2019\u201dShe rolled her eyes. More money, she said, needs to go into promotion and player development. The women\u2019s championship games run only on obscure cable channels; the men\u2019s game is on all public channels.Vad\u00e3o, the Brazilian coach, noted that his team took a cheap flight to Manaus, which is four hours by air from Rio de Janeiro. There was no food, and his players were crowded in economy.Such problems are not unique to Brazil. American female players have filed suit seeking pay equity with the less successful American men\u2019s national team. Players in women\u2019s leagues in Europe and elsewhere remain distinct second-class citizens, their games underpublicized and spottily attended.Perhaps Tuesday evening\u2019s double bill offered a window into a better future. Such was the view of Vera Pauw, the lithe Dutch woman who coaches the South African team. She came to the interview room with jaw set grim, her Olympic road at an end. Then she spoke of the artistry of the Brazilians and of the grit of her team, and especially of all those cheering fans.\u201cBrazil showcased a very mature women\u2019s play and pace; it was beautiful,\u201d she said. \u201cNow we know what we could do with a professional league in South Africa.\u201dShe smiled at herself. People, she said, will tell you that she is not one to gush. She could not help herself. \u201cTo see a huge stadium filled, with fans behind every women\u2019s kick, was fantastic,\u201d she said.That is an Amazonian reverie right there.Email: powellm@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: In \u2018Hillbilly Elegy,\u2019 a Tough Love Analysis of the Poor Who Back Trump", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "Supported byBooks of The TimesAfter reading \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d you can easily understand why. This is a historically peculiar election cycle, boisterously disrupted by outsiders, one of whom found the perfect host body in the Republican Party and became its presidential nominee. An investigation of voter estrangement has never felt more urgent, and we\u2019re certainly not getting one from the lacquered chatterers on the boob tube.Now, along comes Mr. Vance, offering a compassionate, discerning sociological analysis of the white underclass that has helped drive the politics of rebellion, particularly the ascent of Donald J. Trump. Combining thoughtful inquiry with firsthand experience, Mr. Vance has inadvertently provided a civilized reference guide for an uncivilized election, and he\u2019s done so in a vocabulary intelligible to both Democrats and Republicans.Imagine that.On the checklist of modern privilege, Mr. Vance, 31, has the top four in the bag: He is white, male, straight and Protestant.But his profile is misleading. His people \u2014 hillbillies, rednecks, white trash, choose your epithet (or term of affection, depending on your point of view) \u2014 didn\u2019t step off the Mayflower and become part of America\u2019s ascendant class. \u201cPoverty is the family tradition,\u201d he writes. His ancestors and kin were sharecroppers, coal miners, machinists, millworkers \u2014 all low-paying, body-wearying occupations that over the years have vanished or offered diminished security.Mr. Vance was raised in Middletown, Ohio, a now-decaying steel town filled with Kentucky transplants, which at one point included his Mamaw and Papaw \u2014 in newscaster English, that\u2019s grandma and grandpa \u2014 who moved there shortly after World War II. Though the couple eventually managed to achieve the material comforts of a middle-class life (house, car), they brought their Appalachian values and habits with them. Some were wonderfully positive, like loyalty and love of country. But others, like a tendency toward violence and verbal abuse, were inimical to family life.Papaw was forever coming home drunk. Mamaw, \u201ca violent nondrunk,\u201d was forever tormenting him, whether by serving him artfully arranged plates of garbage for dinner or dousing him with gasoline. All this guerrilla warfare affected their children. Mr. Vance\u2019s mother was an empress of instability \u2014 violent, feckless, prone to hysteria. A long stint in rehab couldn\u2019t shake her addiction to prescription narcotics (she\u2019d later move on to heroin). She spun through more boyfriends than this reader could count and at least five husbands.The only reason Mr. Vance made it out in one piece is because his grandparents eventually reconciled, becoming his unofficial guardians. (He also spent a terrifically affirming four years in the Marines.) Mamaw was especially encouraging. She was tough as snakeskin, foul-mouthed as a mobster and filled with love. In a town where many children don\u2019t finish high school, she raised a grandson who managed to graduate from Ohio State University and Yale Law School, defying skyscraping odds.\u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d in my mind, divides into two components: the family stories Mr. Vance tells \u2014 most of which are no doubt better experienced on the page than they were in real life \u2014 and the questions he raises. Chief among them: How much should he hold his hillbilly kin responsible for their own misfortunes?In Mr. Vance\u2019s estimation, the answer is: a lot. Economic insecurity, he\u2019s convinced, accounts for only a small part of his community\u2019s problems; the much larger issue is hillbilly culture itself. Though proud of it in many ways, he\u2019s also convinced that it \u201cincreasingly encourages social decay instead of counteracting it.\u201dHis frustration with the nonworking white poor is especially acute. He recalls being a cashier at a Middletown grocery store and watching resentfully as his neighbors, who had creatively gamed the welfare system, jabbered on their cellphones as they were going through the checkout line.He could not afford a cellphone.\u201cPolitical scientists have spent millions of words trying to explain how Appalachia and the South went from staunchly Democratic to staunchly Republican in less than a generation,\u201d Mr. Vance writes. He suspects those cellphones have a lot to do with it. \u201cI could never understand why our lives felt like a struggle while those living off of government largess enjoyed trinkets that I only dreamed about.\u201dTime and again, Mr. Vance preaches a message of tough love and personal responsibility. He has no patience with an old acquaintance who told him he quit his job because he hated waking up early, only to take to Facebook to blame the \u201cObama economy.\u201d Or with a former co-worker at a tile warehouse who missed work once a week though his girlfriend was pregnant.The difference is that President Obama believes poverty, though it may have a cultural component, is largely a structural problem, one the government can play a large role in fixing. Mr. Vance, a conservative, takes a far dimmer view.Whether you agree with Mr. Vance or not, you must admire him for his head-on confrontation with a taboo subject. And he frames his critique generously, stipulating that it isn\u2019t laziness that\u2019s destroying hillbilly culture but what the psychologist Martin Seligman calls \u201clearned helplessness\u201d \u2014 the fatalistic belief, born of too much adversity, that nothing can be done to change your lot.What he\u2019s really writing about is despair.Never is Mr. Vance more aware of this pessimism and estrangement than when he leaves for Ohio State University. He\u2019s plumped with hope; his neighbors, left behind, feel its opposite. \u201cThere was something almost spiritual,\u201d he writes, \u201cabout the cynicism of the community at large.\u201dHis friends and relations are convinced that the media lies. That politicians lie. That the military, an institution they revere, is fighting two fruitless wars. Universities feel \u201crigged\u201d and inaccessible; job prospects are slim. For what purpose do you live under such circumstances? When the stanchions of your life have sunk into the muck?Mr. Vance doesn\u2019t have all the answers. But he\u2019s advancing the conversation.Hillbilly ElegyA Memoir of a Family and Culture in CrisisBy J. D. Vance264 pages. Harper. $27.99.Advertisement"}

Online sales clocked in at about $14 billion last year, barely 3 percent of Walmart\u2019s top line. Amazon, by comparison, reported a revenue increase of about one-fifth in 2015 to $100 billion, excluding web services. It also was about a year ago that Amazon charged past Walmart in terms of market value. At $350 billion, it is now 60 percent larger.Walmart lags in other areas, too. Its marketplace that allows consumers to sell their products next to Walmart\u2019s own has more than 10 million items. Amazon counts 200 million, according to Jefferies. What\u2019s more, Amazon is considering turf once claimed by Walmart. It recently expanded the markets in which it delivers fresh food such as milk and produce.Given Walmart\u2019s ambitions, Jet understandably makes for a tempting target. Marc Lore, one of the founders of Jet, also helped start the company behind Diapers.com, which Amazon bought in 2010. Introduced just last year, Jet has been struggling to challenge its larger online rival; already, it has changed its business model. Jet first required a $50 annual membership fee in a bid to mimic the successful Costco structure online. It dropped the idea, however, and turned its attention to other ways to generate revenue.Walmart has been rapidly acquiring start-ups over the last couple of years, including Yumprint, a recipe and meal-planning service, and Adchemy, an advertising technology specialist. Jet would be a bigger acquisition. It has raised more than $500 million and is valued at more than $1 billion. Walmart can afford to buy as it builds, but even a galloping \u201cunicorn,\u201d as start-ups valued at more than $1 billion are known, will struggle to tow the lumbering retailer into a competitive position online.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Joe Dante: \u2018Gremlins\u2019 Director Reflects on His Biggest Hits", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Word WithMr. Dante began his film career in the early \u201970s cutting trailers for Roger Corman, and went on to create low-budget pictures that paid clever homage to B-movies of the past while making sly, sardonic commentaries on contemporary mores. Mr. Dante\u2019s freewheeling comedic sense avoided the self-seriousness that afflicted many of his peers. He has worked frequently in episodic television, most recently directing for \u201cHawaii Five-O,\u201d and he is raising money to make a feature film about Mr. Corman, \u201cThe Man With Kaleidoscope Eyes.\u201dBut Mr. Dante is trenchantly realistic: \u201cMovies are a 20th-century art form, and the 20th century is over,\u201d he said during an interview in which he discussed fighting to keep the grimmest of Christmas tales in \u201cGremlins,\u201d working with a young Ethan Hawke and River Phoenix on their first movie and creating a \u201cGremlins 2\u201d character, who resembles a certain Republican presidential nominee. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.It was not a popular feature of the movie with the studio, or almost anyone. The studio took umbrage at it, and after our successful preview the only note they had was to get rid of that scene. I suppose I could have taken it out. In Chris Columbus\u2019s original script, it had been a throwaway. Phoebe really liked it because up until she tells that story, her character had been a pretty generic girlfriend \u2014 this gave her a secret. Because Steven Spielberg was the executive producer, I was able to get him to back me on keeping it in.\u201cExplorers\u201d (1985) is a movie you feel didn\u2019t quite work out, but it did introduce some terrific then-child actors, including Ethan Hawke and River Phoenix. What were they and the others like to work with? They were wonderful, very giving and open. I do love working with kids. It was like being a dad for a summer. Ethan wasn\u2019t even officially auditioning, he was with another actor who was auditioning and we really liked him. When we had Ethan, River and Jason Presson trapped up in the blue-screen \u201cspaceship,\u201d they were miked up, so we overheard their conversations, and it was remarkably reassuring that they were saying the same things I\u2019d said with my friends when I was 13.The 1987 science-fiction comedy \u201cInnerspace\u201d has a miniaturized Dennis Quaid piloting through the body of Martin Short \u2014 two very different types. How did you get them to interact in the illusion of a shared space?That\u2019s not quite how it worked, the idea of shooting one half of their performance. Wherever we were, whenever we were shooting, Dennis would be on the set in a booth, so the interaction was really happening. Dennis would hew to the script a little more than Marty. After you got a scene in the can, he\u2019d beg for more takes, in the voice of Katharine Hepburn, which was hard to resist.Carrie Fisher is one of the funniest people in Hollywood, but her comedic talents are rarely used, which is why she\u2019s an outstanding feature of 1989\u2019s \u201cThe \u2019Burbs\u201d with Tom Hanks. I\u2019m also a fan of \u201cLooney Tunes: Back in Action\u201d (2003), but I hear you\u2019re not.I took that on because my friend Chuck Jones had recently passed away and I felt I owed it to him to present the characters as accurately as possible, which hadn\u2019t been the case with \u201cSpace Jam.\u201d It was very frustrating to make: We got so much input from people who were never going to see the movie. I learned here that it\u2019s not a good idea to go to work angry, although it might have helped with the Daffy Duck segments. When I saw its final cut, I thought it was a noisy, annoying movie of the sort that other people make. I do feel it does represent the characters accurately. I came out feeling exhausted. But that\u2019s the norm these days.Among other outrageous characters, \u201cGremlins 2: The New Batch\u201d features a media mogul-real estate tycoon named Daniel Clamp, author of \u201cI Took Manhattan,\u201d played by John Glover. Do you find his real-life model as funny as he was back in 1990?Had I but known! He\u2019s definitely not as funny as he used to be. Because the movie treats the character with some skewed affection, I now like to think Clamp is more Ted Turner than Donald Trump.An article on Thursday about the director Joe Dante quoted incorrectly from his comments about the actors in a scene in his film \u201cExplorers.\u201d One of them is Jason Presson, not Bobby Fite.Advertisement"}

He also deeply appreciates, he added, the simple joy of the unexpected.Laura Fried, the Seattle Art Fair\u2019s artistic director, said that she gravitated to what the artists were trying to say about the connection between technology and modern life.\u201cThe conceptual underpinnings are more what I find interesting,\u201d she said.\u201cThe way that we are arranging our world is changing, with digital space merging with physical space,\u201d she said. \u201cI really love thinking about softness in public.\u201dMs. Kasper said she thought about the human stories behind the objects in assembling her cymbals project.

Either the person would get a refund or the merchandise would be re-sent. The customer service rep informed me that I could dispose of the box and its contents or keep whatever was in the box.For nearly an hour the box sat on my living room floor unopened. Curiosity got the best of me and with the help of two visiting teenage girls, the box was opened. My reward for being a nice person: 48 rolls of toilet paper.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cloud Computing Brings Sprawling Centers, but Few Jobs, to Small Towns", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBoydton JournalBOYDTON, Va. \u2014 A giant Microsoft facility just outside this very small town hides behind a quarter-mile berm and a guard house, across the highway from the rubble of a demolished prison.Behind the berm, six unmarked hangars each hold tens of thousands of computer servers. Microsoft has cleared enough scrub trees and vines for at least 15 of these buildings, and six more are already under construction.One thing there isn\u2019t much of at this Microsoft complex, one single computer data center, is long-term work. Microsoft says it might have \u201cseveral dozen\u201d employees in a place like this. They are mostly elite computer workers who tend not to come from Boydton, which lost a lot of good jobs when nearby factories closed and the prison shut down.So it is in a number of small towns across the country, as technology giants like Amazon, Google and Microsoft race to build networks of unprecedented size to provide services over the internet, a technology trend known as cloud computing. Local people, along with many economists and officials, often think these data centers are a key to an industrial revival. But the reality is less impressive.\u201cI\u2019ve worked on a lot of nuclear power plants, and these things are a lot bigger than that,\u201d said E. W. Gregory, the head of the local electrical workers\u2019 union. But \u201cthe first thing they put in was a guard shack and a fence. I\u2019ve filled rooms with people looking for entry-level work. None of it lasts.\u201dThe companies come to places like Boydton for basics like land, water and electricity. Even with low local wages, people are a high-cost item. As small as the staffs at these mammoth facilities are, companies say, perhaps a third of the company jobs will eventually be filled by robots.Google started building in eastern Oregon to be near cheap hydroelectric power on the Columbia River, and most recently it has focused on Iowa, Alabama and Tennessee. Microsoft has a center in Wyoming, and it bought a nine-hole golf course as part of a complex near West Des Moines, Iowa. Amazon recently built similar giant facilities on the outer reaches of Columbus, Ohio, and Dulles, Va.\u201cA lot of this stuff is put in rural parts of the country that used to be part of a manufacturing economy\u201d that has gone overseas, said Bill Coughran, a partner at the venture investment firm Sequoia Capital who ran much of Google\u2019s big engineering for eight years. \u201cTextiles and furniture created a big power grid in the south. Then those jobs went away.\u201dThat\u2019s been the story for Boydton, population 430, in the middle of tobacco country a few miles from the North Carolina border. The prison across from the Microsoft center closed in 2012. A nearby Burlington Industries textile plant that employed more than 2,000 shut in 2002. It was razed in 2012.The South Virginia tobacco economy collapsed as Americans cut back on smoking. But in 1999, Virginia used some of the $4.1 billion it received in a settlement with cigarette makers to build high-speed fiber-optic lines throughout the region.The broadband drew Microsoft, along with some financial perks. Mecklenburg County, which received $2.1 million from the state for the project, has given Microsoft 350 acres and offset personal property taxes by 82.5 percent, according to Wayne Carter, the county administrator.Initially, Apple, which is building a big cloud center for consumers\u2019 photos and music, wanted the Boydton site, but it went across the border to North Carolina, which promised tax breaks on its data center equipment. Not to be outdone, Virginia passed laws in 2009 and 2010 that exempted sales taxes on things like data center computer servers, software, power generators and chillers to cool all that equipment.\u201cWe\u2019ve had six years of construction work,\u201d said Mr. Carter. That has helped the county, he said, because even temporary workers rent houses, stay in hotels and eat in local restaurants.Microsoft did not dispute reports that it would spend $1.1 billion on the Boydton data center, and said that \u201con average, data centers employ tens to several dozen people,\u201d in a mixture of corporate and contracted positions. It declined to let a reporter tour the site.\u201cThey talked about 100 jobs, but it\u2019s a slow process,\u201d said Thomas C. Coleman III, the mayor of Boydton. So far, he says, the biggest impact \u201chas been a couple of lunch tables at the Triangle gas station.\u201dHe understates matters, but not by much. Mr. Gregory, the electrician, said his union had hundreds of applicants for work digging ditches and laying pipe, starting at $10.88 an hour. Wiring paid $28.59. Both jobs tended to last about six months, he said, with lots of attrition for the hard outdoor labor.Working as a security guard or as someone testing the wires inside the data center offers better money, but there are not many positions. Microsoft prefers to fly in its own specialists for some work, and it doesn\u2019t like hiring people who have worked in other big companies\u2019 cloud-computing centers, Mr. Gregory said. (Microsoft said it did not exclude candidates based on previous experience.)\u201cWe can provide a place to live, but all those contractors will move on to the next town where they\u2019re building,\u201d Mr. Coleman said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you can count on.\u201dThe big cloud networks are immensely profitable for the few companies who can operate these global systems. The biggest three cloud companies estimate that the global market in business computing is worth $1 trillion or more, and they are rushing to expand globally. In interviews, all said they spend more than $2 billion annually on this.\u201cIt\u2019s phenomenal how rapidly they are growing,\u201d said Erik Brynjolfsson, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has written extensively on the impact of new technologies. \u201cIt is the key enabler of all kinds of technology advances, starting with the things companies do now, but lots cheaper, including outsourcing tech jobs.\u201dThat is hard to imagine in places where local roots go so deep. Conversations here usually start with people explaining where they are from, and what their families did here for generations. \u201cBoydton is the quintessential quaint courthouse town,\u201d said Leigh Lambert, the town librarian. \u201cPeople from here love it. It feels like it\u2019s always with you.\u201dMs. Lambert grew up nearby, tried New York, and returned to work next to the court, which is adorned with a statue of a Confederate soldier. Microsoft initially came to a couple of town meetings, and it seemed to offer a way Boydton could come back. \u201cNow they\u2019re off by themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cWe hear they have a really nice Starbucks machine.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Don\u2019t Count on It", "Date": "2016-08-24", "News": "Supported byTech FixWHAT do subscriptions to a newspaper, magazine or Netflix account have in common? Once you sign up, you expect to pay the same rate every month.I learned this the hard way while reviewing an email summary of my Amazon subscriptions. A pack of lint rollers that I had subscribed to for more than two years recently jumped to $18.04 a pack, up from $12.44 since the last delivery a few months ago, or almost a 50 percent increase.Amazon declined to comment. The company emails people 10 days before a recurring subscription delivery, when it informs customers of a new price of their item so they can change or skip the order.Any sticker shock, analysts said, may be the result of Amazon\u2019s complex pricing system coming into conflict with consumer expectations of a traditional subscription.Jared Wiesel, a partner at Revenue Analytics, a pricing and sales consulting firm, said of Amazon, \u201cI think they\u2019ve violated the psychological concept of a subscription with their customers in changing prices like this. When people think of a subscription, they think of locking in a set cadence of receiving a good.\u201dAmazon\u2019s dynamic pricing system, in which it frequently adjusts item prices based on a sophisticated set of variables like supply and demand, time of day and prices offered by competitors, is the company\u2019s way of making it look as if you are always getting the best deal, Mr. Wiesel said.Prices of goods can also fall, of course. But even when prices decline, people need to beware because Amazon\u2019s pricing tends to fluctuate more widely and more frequently than at your local grocery store or Walmart, Mr. Wiesel added. In traditional retail, the major price changes typically happen during promotions, he said.Prices of most items, including dishwasher soap and toilet bowl cleaner, changed frequently. As often as weekly, prices rose, dipped and rose again like a roller coaster. In extreme cases, prices for items like instant coffee and napkins jumped between 90 and 170 percent. (Prices below reflect subscription discounts.)\u2022 Folgers Coffee, 30.5-Ounce Tub\u2022 Vanity Fair Napkins______Only five of the Subscribe & Save items held steady.\u2022 Sparkle Paper Towels\u2022 Death Wish CoffeeAfter the service\u2019s 5 percent discount, the paper towels cost $24.69 and the coffee cost $18.99. Not bad.______In the end, whether you save money depends on when your subscription order is placed and what items you buy. The downside of buying through Amazon\u2019s subscription program is the lack of predictability, Mr. Wiesel said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen this type of price fluctuation in a brick-and-mortar store,\u201d he added. Some highlights over the last six months (with subscription discounts applied):\u2022 GermGuardian Air Purifier Replacement Filter\u2022 Honeywell Humidifier Replacement Filter\u2022 Lysol Disinfecting Wipes (3-Pack)______Mr. Wiesel noted that it would be tough for Amazon to revise its subscription program to offer items at fixed rates. A majority of sales on Amazon are one-time purchases, and dynamic pricing is fundamental to how the company operates. If, for example, Subscribe & Save prices remained static, those customers could miss out when prices go down for one-time purchases of the same products.If you truly want to save money on Amazon, one approach is to sign up for price alerts on Camel Camel Camel to get an email when a price drops to a desired amount. When that happens, manually reorder \u2014 yes, that\u2019s an extra step \u2014 your instant coffee, toilet cleaner or lint rollers.Sucharita Mulpuru-Kodali, an analyst for Forrester Research who follows Amazon, said the retailer was probably pushing prices up to test how loyal customers are to products and how much more they are willing to pay for them. Yet the sharp price changes on Subscribe & Save items caught her by surprise.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem as customer-friendly as Amazon typically is,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s unusual.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jeers Don\u2019t Bother Hope Solo as United States Wins Rio Opener", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Just nine minutes into the United States women\u2019s soccer team\u2019s Olympic opener Wednesday night, Carli Lloyd headed in an arcing shot that eluded the New Zealand goalkeeper and gave the United States a 1-0 lead.It was an immediate echo from last year\u2019s World Cup final, in which Lloyd scored in the third, fifth and 16th minutes as part of a four-goal onslaught that helped produce a 5-2 victory over Japan, as well as national acclaim and a ticker-tape parade in Manhattan.But on Wednesday, not much happened after Lloyd scored. The Americans dominated play, but except for a nice passing sequence that set up Alex Morgan for the second and final goal of the game early in the second half, they had trouble creating a sustained offense.Instead, what was most notable about the 2-0 victory was the vociferous jeering that the American goalie Hope Solo received when she handled the ball or kicked it. Solo was apparently paying the price for the public comments and Twitter posts she has made in connection with the mosquito-borne Zika virus, which has plagued Brazil.Earlier this year, Solo said she might not take part in the Olympics because of the virus. She ultimately decided that she would, but more recently she put up a couple of Twitter posts that seemed to take a flippant attitude toward the problem. One post showed a picture of Solo in what looked like a beekeeper\u2019s mask. Another showed an assortment of repellents spread out on a bed.And while Solo took a much different tone before Wednesday\u2019s game, expressing sympathy for the people of Brazil and saying she would not want to offend anyone who lives there, the modest-size crowd in the Mineir\u00e3o in Belo Horizonte let her have it anyway, even eventually yelling \u201cZika!\u201d when she would kick the ball downfield.Afterward, Solo, who has had a controversial career and is still involved in a domestic violence case, tried to shrug off the treatment she had just received.\u201cThey\u2019re having fun,\u201d she told NBC when asked about the fans. \u201cAt least it\u2019s loud in the stadium. I\u2019d rather have that than hear a needle drop.\u201dSolo, herself, did not have all that much to do in the game. New Zealand had some corner kicks but never a moment when it had a dangerous shot on net.Instead, Solo spent most of the game observing an American team that took the field with a lot of familiar faces from last year\u2019s World Cup, but with some new players, too \u2014 midfielder Allie Long and forward Mallory Pugh, 18.Pugh, however, had trouble generating scoring threats and eventually was replaced up front by another newcomer \u2014 Crystal Dunn, who had a more significant impact on the game.Megan Rapinoe, who has yet to play since ripping up her right knee in December, did not get on the field. The veteran Rapinoe is the most creative playmaker on the American team, and her absence seemed to be felt in those extended moments when the United States had trouble launching a coherent attack. At some point, Coach Jill Ellis will presumably need her, but not yet, it appears.Next up for the United States, meanwhile, is a game on Saturday against France, a tough opponent. Then comes their final game of the first round, against Colombia, on Aug. 9, in the Amazon. It\u2019s possible the jeers might follow Solo all the way there.Earlier, Sweden edged South Africa, 1-0, in another Group E game, but most of the seats did not appear to be filled. Nilla Fischer scored the only goal of that game.In a Group F game at Arena Corinthians in S\u00e3o Paulo, Janine Beckie of Canada took only 20 seconds to make a mark on her third Summer Games, scoring the fastest goal ever at the Olympics in a 2-0 victory over Australia. It was nine seconds faster than Oribe Peralta\u2019s strike for Mexico in the men\u2019s gold medal match against Brazil four years ago in London.Canada had to play with only 10 women after Shelina Zadorsky was sent off in the 19th minute for dragging down Michelle Heyman as Heyman was headed toward the goal.In a later Group F match, Melanie Behringer scored twice as the three-time bronze medalist Germany routed Zimbabwe, 6-1.

Hulu\u2019s other corporate owners are 21st Century Fox, Comcast and the Walt Disney Company.The development makes Time Warner \u201can official member of the \u2018cool kids\u2019 club,\u2019\u201d Todd Juenger, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, said in a research note.The new Hulu service is an attempt by its traditional entertainment company owners to secure their footing in television\u2019s digital future, where streaming has become the norm and competition from deep-pocketed rivals like Netflix and Amazon has intensified. Hulu has more than 10 million subscribers, compared with Netflix\u2019s 46 million paid subscribers in the United States.\u201cThis investment from Time Warner marks a major step for Hulu as we continue to redefine television for both consumers and advertisers,\u201d Mike Hopkins, Hulu\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement.The transaction came at a crucial time for Hulu. The service was \u201cfacing rapidly mounting losses approaching $500 million\u201d a year, according to Richard Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG Research. The investment from Time Warner reduces the amount of funding needed from its existing owners, he added.\u201cHulu is locked in a fierce battle for content with far larger Netflix and a far better funded Amazon, with Hulu\u2019s subbase not scaling as rapidly as we would expect based on its content investments,\u201d Mr. Greenfield said in a research note. \u201cIn turn, the Hulu partnership is eager to find additional partner(s) to enter the joint venture to help fund the losses, which are likely to increase meaningfully\u201d with the start of the new live service.Time Warner said that its TNT, TBS, CNN and other Turner cable networks would be available live and on demand on Hulu\u2019s new live-streaming service.\u201cOur investment in Hulu underscores Time Warner\u2019s commitment to supporting and developing new platforms for the delivery of high-quality content and great consumer experiences to audiences around the globe,\u201d Mr. Bewkes said.The transaction includes no representation on the board of Hulu, which gives Time Warner less say in dictating Hulu\u2019s destiny but also reduces the complicated ownership structure of the venture. Time Warner previously was in discussions about coming in as an equal partner in the venture, according to a person briefed on the discussions.\u201cWe don\u2019t have an active role, and coming in as the 10 percent investor without a board seat, we think it reduces complications around governance,\u201d Mr. Bewkes said during a conference call.He added that the transaction would infuse Hulu with more resources to \u201cfostering competition and innovation\u201d among streaming services as well as traditional cable and satellite distributors.One big concern about the new streamlined bundle from Hulu is that traditional cable and satellite distributors view it as a threat. That could put at risk the billions of dollars that the TV networks receive each year from those traditional distributors.Both Hulu and its corporate owners have downplayed those concerns, stating that it is designed for people who don\u2019t subscribe to a traditional pay television service.Total revenue was down 5 percent in the quarter to $7 billion, with a decline at the company\u2019s Warner Brothers film and television studios offset by growth at its Turner and HBO units.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Walmart Is Said to Be in Talks to Acquire Jet.com", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "Supported byJet.com was born out of a dream of taking on Amazon and its grip on the world of e-commerce. But the online discount retailer may instead be poised for a humbling sale to the biggest traditional store chain around.Jet.com is in talks to sell itself to Walmart, two people briefed on the matter said on Wednesday. The talks are continuing and may not lead to a deal.The discussions are an acknowledgment of the tough reality of America\u2019s $350 billion e-commerce market, which has for years been dominated by Amazon. While plenty of competitors \u2014 including physical retailers and online start-ups \u2014 have tried to take on Amazon with strategies like focusing only on specific niches of the market or having flash sales, none have succeeded.From offices in Hoboken, N.J., Jet.com tried to chart a different course in the e-commerce market. It attacked Amazon directly, seeking to build a national network of warehouses while offering a similarly broad selection of goods. But it also sought to undercut Amazon on price, using complex formulas that adjust the cost of items based on factors like the quantity of products bought at once. For an annual membership fee of $50, Jet.com consumers could get access to goods priced 10 to 15 percent less than anywhere else on the web.Mr. Lore also tried to make Jet.com different from other start-ups at the workplace. Most start-ups try to bend a reluctant universe to their will, which means employees sweat 12-hour days and seven-day weeks. Private lives go by the wayside. But Jet promoted itself as a start-up with a difference: one focused on employee well-being.His approach in e-commerce and the workplace may have seemed quixotic, but Mr. Lore succeeded in raising more than $500 million from many investors, including venture capital firms like New Enterprise Associates and the mutual fund company Fidelity. Jet.com quickly gained a valuation of roughly $1 billion.Along the way, it was hailed as a particularly ambitious \u201cunicorn,\u201d the once-ballyhooed class of Silicon Valley start-ups valued at $1 billion or more.A month later, after Jet.com had finished a fund-raising round, Mr. Lore said: \u201cIt was challenging. The market conditions have turned, and there is a lot of negative press around private company financing. The fact that we got it done was on the back of the company\u2019s performance.\u201dFor Walmart, pursuing Jet.com in what would be one of its biggest takeovers, a deal would help the retailer reproduce its off-line dominance in the online world. The Bentonville, Ark., company has pumped millions of dollars into efforts to expand its e-commerce business, such as offering more items online and expanding locations for its grocery pickup service.At the end of 2015, Walmart had about eight million items available at Walmart.com. That\u2019s now up to 10 million. Four years ago, it was under two million, Walmart has said. The retailer does not break out a quarterly figure for online sales, but it said its e-commerce business had grown 7 percent in the last quarter.Walmart recently announced a two-day subscription shipping service for $49, its version of Amazon\u2019s $99 annual Prime membership. Walmart is also trying to take advantage of its position as the nation\u2019s largest grocer, nearly tripling the number of markets where customers can order groceries and pick up curbside.Jet\u2019s model of encouraging bulk buying would complement Walmart in areas where the retailer has lagged, according to Neil Saunders, a retail analyst with Conlumino, a research and consulting firm.A decade ago, consumers might have been more inclined to stop at Walmart for household items like toilet paper and laundry detergent in \u201cfairly reasonable quantities\u201d and pick up other items while they were there, Mr. Saunders said.\u201cWhat\u2019s happened, though, with these online sites is that people first of all are much more likely to buy in bulk because they can get better deals,\u201d he said.Reporting was contributed by David Streitfeld, Rachel Abrams, Leslie Picker and Katie Benner.Advertisement"}

On Monday, it was holding strong in the No. 2 position, trailing only \u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child.\u201d (The Times does not track the Constitution for its own best-seller rankings.)\u201cI was watching the D.N.C. and saw Mr. Khan\u2019s speech and was extremely moved by it,\u201d Lorraine Kenny, the A.C.L.U.\u2019s head of marketing, said on Monday. \u201cI thought, \u2018We have to do something with this.\u2019\u201dMs. Kenny said the organization had received more than 40,000 orders since Friday. \u201cThis situation is just off the scale in terms of people\u2019s response and interest,\u201d she said.But pocket-size versions come with an added feature \u2014 a physical representation of Americans\u2019 rights that can be hoisted during a congressional hearing, political rally or a spirited discussion with a police officer.Miniature Constitutions have in recent years been closely identified with conservative groups like the Tea Party, which have used them at their rallies.

{"Headline": "Walmart\u2019s Bid for Jet.com Could Help It Compete Against Amazon", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsWalmart may be trying to hasten its pursuit of Amazon by acquiring an e-commerce start-up.The retail titan is said to be in talks to buy Jet.com, a fledgling online shopping site, a move that would fit into a bigger plan to enhance its lackluster digital and e-commerce efforts, while Amazon keeps moving ahead with new products and services, like one-day shipping and grocery delivery.Doug McMillon, Walmart\u2019s president and chief executive, has no illusions about how his company is faring on the web. \u201cGrowth here is too slow,\u201d he said in May. Online sales clocked in at about $14 billion last year, barely 3 percent of Walmart\u2019s top line. Amazon, by comparison, reported a revenue increase of about one-fifth in 2015 to $100 billion, excluding web services. It also was about a year ago that Amazon charged past Walmart in terms of market value. At $350 billion, it is now 60 percent larger.Walmart lags in other areas, too. Its marketplace that allows consumers to sell their products next to Walmart\u2019s own has more than 10 million items. Amazon counts 200 million, according to Jefferies. What\u2019s more, Amazon is considering turf once claimed by Walmart. It recently expanded the markets in which it delivers fresh food such as milk and produce.Given Walmart\u2019s ambitions, Jet understandably makes for a tempting target. Marc Lore, one of the founders of Jet, also helped start the company behind Diapers.com, which Amazon bought in 2010. Introduced just last year, Jet has been struggling to challenge its larger online rival; already, it has changed its business model. Jet first required a $50 annual membership fee in a bid to mimic the successful Costco structure online. It dropped the idea, however, and turned its attention to other ways to generate revenue.Walmart has been rapidly acquiring start-ups over the last couple of years, including Yumprint, a recipe and meal-planning service, and Adchemy, an advertising technology specialist. Jet would be a bigger acquisition. It has raised more than $500 million and is valued at more than $1 billion. Walmart can afford to buy as it builds, but even a galloping \u201cunicorn,\u201d as start-ups valued at more than $1 billion are known, will struggle to tow the lumbering retailer into a competitive position online.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Time Warner Deal Gives Hulu a Much-Needed $580 Million Lift", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsTime Warner\u2019s willingness to serve as sous-chef in Hulu\u2019s crowded kitchen could keep the broth from spoiling.Hulu, the digital TV service, will get $580 million from Time Warner, the American media conglomerate, and fresh programs from its TNT and CNN networks. Notably, however, Time Warner will hold a smaller stake in Hulu than other major investors and refrain from joining a board already crowded by rivals like Walt Disney, 21st Century Fox and Comcast.Hulu has charted a rocky path since it was started in 2007. Owners clashed over competing ideas and agendas, including trying to protect lucrative fees collected by cable operators to carry their networks. Twice, the service has been put up for sale. A private equity backer sold out. Comcast\u2019s involvement was hamstrung by regulators as part of its acquisition of NBC Universal. Along the way, Hulu lost its highly regarded chief executive.Despite the turmoil, Hulu has benefited from consumers who are increasingly watching TV shows and movies when they want and on devices of their choosing. Hulu has quadrupled the number of paying customers in four years to 12 million, pulling in at least $1.2 billion from those on the lowest plan at $8 a month. That does not include advertising revenue, which Credit Suisse estimates will be $850 million this year.Time Warner\u2019s 10 percent stake, at a $5.8 billion valuation for Hulu, precedes a planned introduction of Hulu\u2019s live-streaming service next year. That feature will distinguish it from rivals like Amazon and Netflix, which trades at a higher multiple of sales than Hulu does based on its new investment. For now, only shows from the Turner networks will be available, though there are discussions about adding ones from Time Warner\u2019s HBO, home to the hit \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201dHulu will pay Time Warner for the shows, in much the same way that traditional cable companies pay fees to Time Warner. In that sense, at least some of the money from Time Warner will boomerang back to it. Jeffrey Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, emphasized on Wednesday that his company\u2019s investment would give Hulu more programming firepower. Doing so without muscling in too much on the operations may give the joint venture a better shot at success.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "G.E., the 124-Year-Old Software Start-Up", "Date": "2016-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt may not qualify as a lightning-bolt eureka moment, but Jeffrey R. Immelt, chief executive of General Electric, recalls the June day in 2009 that got him thinking. He was speaking with G.E. scientists about new jet engines they were building, laden with sensors to generate a trove of data from every flight \u2014 but to what end?That data could someday be as valuable as the machinery itself, if not more so. But G.E. couldn\u2019t make use of it.But in 2011, G.E. also quietly opened a software center in San Ramon, Calif., 24 miles east of San Francisco, across the bay.Today one of San Ramon\u2019s most important projects is to build a computer operating system, but on an industrial scale \u2014 a Microsoft Windows or Google Android for factories and industrial equipment. The project is central to G.E.\u2019s drive to become what Mr. Immelt says will be a \u201ctop 10 software company\u201d by 2020.Silicon Valley veterans are skeptical.Many industries see digital threats, of course. Yet the scope of the challenge is magnified at G.E., a 124-year-old company and the nation\u2019s largest manufacturer, with more than 300,000 employees worldwide. Employees companywide have been making pilgrimages to San Ramon for technology briefings, but also to soak in the culture. Their marching orders are to try to adapt the digital wizardry and hurry-up habits of Silicon Valley to G.E.\u2019s world of industrial manufacturing.6 PhotosG.E.\u2019s success or failure over the next decade, Mr. Immelt says, depends on this transformation. He calls it \u201cprobably the most important thing I\u2019ve worked on in my career.\u201dApparently, there is no Plan B. \u201cIt\u2019s this or bust,\u201d he said.The march of digital technology \u2014 mainly inexpensive sensors, powerful computing and clever software \u2014 into the industrial world has been underway for years under the guise of \u201cthe internet of things\u201d or \u201cthe industrial internet.\u201d It is the next battlefield as companies fight to develop the dominant software layer that connects the machines.It promises to be a huge market for new products, improved service and efficiency gains in industries like energy, transportation and health care. By 2020, the industrial internet market will reach $225 billion, G.E. executives predicted in a recent meeting with analysts.So far, a major application has been predictive maintenance. Software analyzes the data generated by a machine to identify early warning signals that it needs repair, before it breaks down.The data volumes are exploding as machines new and old spawn sensors. By 2020, G.E. estimates that the data flowing off its machines in use will jump a hundredfold. That should enable far more detailed analysis, giving G.E. a chance to sell its customers not machines but \u201cbusiness outcomes,\u201d like fuel savings. Mr. Immelt sees this as a move up the industrial food chain.Yet all of this exposes G.E. to new competition beyond its traditional rivals like Rockwell Automation, Siemens and United Technologies. Tech giants, including Amazon, Cisco, Google, IBM and Microsoft also have their eye on the industrial internet market, as do a bevy of start-ups.There is precedent for trouble in other industries, of course. Google and Facebook transformed media and advertising, Amazon redefined retailing, and Uber applied an entirely new business model to taxis, which hadn\u2019t changed much in generations.\u201cThe real danger is that the data and analysis becomes worth more than the installed equipment itself,\u201d said Karim R. Lakhani, a professor at the Harvard Business School. \u201cG.E. has no choice but to try to do that itself.\u201dUntil this year, Darren Haas hadn\u2019t thought about G.E., certainly not working there. To him, G.E. meant little more than than kitchen appliances and light bulbs. \u201cI had no idea,\u201d Mr. Haas said.But he was intrigued after he met with Harel Kodesh, an expert in mobile and cloud computing who led teams at Microsoft and VMware, a maker of data-center software. Less than two years ago, Mr. Kodesh joined G.E., and he is now chief technology officer of GE Digital.That someone of Mr. Kodesh\u2019s caliber was a G.E. convert got Mr. Haas\u2019s attention. Then, Mr. Haas started grasping the role that G.E. equipment plays across the economy \u2014 in transportation, in hospitals \u2014 \u201ca whole world,\u201d he said. \u201cI found that really, really compelling.\u201dThe other thing Mr. Haas, 41, found appealing was the big computing challenge that lies ahead for the company. In May, he joined G.E. from Apple, where he was a member of the founding team at Siri, the voice-based digital assistant start-up Apple acquired in 2010. When he left Apple, Mr. Haas was head of cloud engineering, managing the computing engine behind Siri, iTunes and iCloud.At GE Digital, Mr. Haas has a similar title, head of platform cloud engineering, but in a different setting. He describes his job as applying modern software technology \u2014 machine learning, artificial intelligence and cloud computing \u2014 to the industrial arena. \u201cI\u2019ve got my work cut out for me,\u201d he said.Mr. Haas is working on the centerpiece of G.E.\u2019s software strategy, a product called Predix. Its evolution mirrors G.E.\u2019s software ambitions.Predix began as little more than a brand of software used by G.E. to service the gear it sells. One showcase use was in jet engines to do predictive maintenance, saving downtime. Around 2013, William Ruh, a former Cisco Systems executive brought in to put together the San Ramon software center, started expanding Predix to other G.E. industrial businesses.But that soon felt too small. The issue was \u201coutside disrupters,\u201d Mr. Ruh said, citing the online lodging start-up Airbnb as an example of rivals that can appear seemingly out of nowhere and that \u201cbring greater productivity \u2014 but don\u2019t own the assets they sell.\u201d G.E., Mr. Ruh notes, is the ultimate big-asset company.The other threat was rising interest among tech companies to take their internet connectivity expertise and try to apply it to industrial businesses. To get ahead of all this, G.E. reimagined Predix as a cloud-based operating system for industrial applications.Mr. Kodesh leads that effort. He ticks off the looming competitors: Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and others. \u201cThose companies are going to encroach on the territory,\u201d Mr. Kodesh said. \u201cAre we going to capitulate, or build something like Predix?\u201dThe basic idea is that G.E. and outside software developers will write programs to run on Predix. This software might, for instance, monitor the health and fine-tune the operation of equipment like oil-field rigs and wind-farm turbines, improving performance, reducing wear and adapting to changing environmental conditions. It amounts to software delivering the equivalent of personalized medicine for machines.Like any other computer operating system, Predix aims to take the complexity out of writing programs, so more people can create them. And while the instincts of the industrial world are proprietary, G.E. is following an open-source model with Predix, providing a basic design, but one open to outside contributors \u2014 more like Android from Google than Windows from Microsoft.Predix, Mr. Kodesh said, will be improved using the software equivalent of Lego blocks. \u201cSome will be G.E.\u2019s, and some will be made by third-party developers,\u201d he said.G.E. is betting that its deep knowledge of industry will give it an edge in this software arms race. The stakes for this kind of programming can be high.For a regular consumer using the internet, a misfiring algorithm in the software \u2014 \u201ca false positive\u201d \u2014 might mean a person sees an irrelevant online ad, or a bad Amazon book suggestion or Netflix movie recommendation, Mr. Kodesh said. Useless, perhaps, but not necessarily costly. But a false positive that prompts an airline to take a jet engine off the wing, Mr. Kodesh said, is a $100,000 mistake.\u201cWe really do need to have different technology, different algorithms and a different cloud, than in the consumer internet,\u201d he said.G.E. has set an ambitious target for Predix. It hopes to attract $100 million in orders this year, on its way to $4 billion in revenue by 2020. By then, the company forecasts that its total digital business \u2014 more than 90 percent of it software \u2014 may reach as much as $15 billion, up from $6 billion now.For Predix to reach its potential, though, G.E. needs outside programmers to write software for it. The company, with its deep pockets, can start the software-writing parade, but will others follow?This will be a major test. And G.E.\u2019s campaign to build an industrial operating system and create a flourishing ecosystem of software for it is just getting underway in earnest.In late July, G.E. hosted a Predix conference in Las Vegas, which attracted 1,200 software developers. Such developer gatherings are part of the playbook of every major software company but unusual for an industrial corporation.G.E. has some built-in advantages. Its installed base is huge. For example, the company says more than a third of the world\u2019s electricity is generated on G.E. equipment. It can make progress simply by winning over the aircraft makers, oil companies, hospitals and utilities that now depend on G.E. machinery.G.E. is starting to attract a developer following. Tata Consultancy Services, for one, says it now has 500 programmers designing and developing Predix applications for customers in the electric-utility, aviation and health care industries. G.E. also promotes partnerships with Infosys, Wipro and Capgemini to help business write Predix software.When he joined in 2011, Mr. Ruh had no illusions that making software a strength at a heavy-industry company would be easy. At the time, he told Mr. Immelt that would be \u201ca 10-year journey,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of that journey.\u201dPart of that is an effort to change an engineering culture that stretches back generations. \u201cIf G.E. is truly going to be a digital-industrial company, we can\u2019t be separate here,\u201d Mr. Ruh said of his software division. Digital \u201ctools and habits\u201d need to be embedded \u201cin how people do their jobs,\u201d he said.In its factory in Greenville, S.C., G.E. produces both giant power generators and evidence that this metamorphosis might work.The three-story building is crowded with immense cranes and milling, grinding and welding machines, overseen by manufacturing engineers and technicians. The finishing touches are being put on one of G.E.\u2019s new gas turbines.It looks like the business end of a rocket ship lying on its side, a gleaming steel dynamo at rest. It weighs 950,000 pounds. It fires up at nearly 2,900 degrees Fahrenheit, and it can generate enough electricity to supply more than 500,000 households.The gas turbine was brought to market in half the typical five years. That kind of accelerated product development is a performance that G.E. hopes to replicate across its industrial businesses. And it is a story of changes in design and manufacturing practices made possible by digital technology.John Lammas, the 56-year-old vice president for power generation engineering, started his working career 40 years ago, on the shop floor of a Rolls-Royce jet engine factory in Birmingham, England. He has been with G.E. for 31 years, moving up the ranks of the company\u2019s jet engine and power turbine divisions.\u201cI\u2019m an old mechanical guy,\u201d he said. But a couple of years ago, he issued an edict: no more paper drawings.In the past, a model of a new part would be made and then converted to detailed blueprints running to 70 pages or more. These would then be physically sent to G.E. manufacturing engineers and outside suppliers to begin setting up the tooling, casting and cutting for the part.This prototype-and-blueprint routine took up to eight weeks. Now, engineers use 3-D computer models, skip the prototype step and instantly send the models electronically.This goes a step beyond computer-aided design, which is commonplace. In Greenville, the designers are for the first time linked directly with manufacturers and suppliers in real time, in what G.E. calls a \u201cdigital thread.\u201d This means they can collaborate in ways that have changed the work process while making it more likely that problems or defects are spotted sooner.Traditionally, one set of engineers designed a part, and only then passed it on to manufacturing. If a problem arose on the supplier side, the design was kicked back and the process started over. \u201cJobs are combining in this digital world,\u201d Mr. Lammas said.Greenville\u2019s own equipment has been a Predix guinea pig. The machinery and factory were retrofitted with data-generating sensors and the software. Matt Krause, the plant manager, said that last winter, when a snowstorm shut the factory for a day, the sensor network detected that the plant had consumed 1,000 pounds of argon, an inert gas used in coatings for parts. The leak was fixed, saving $350,000 a year.\u201cWe can see things we never did before,\u201d Mr. Krause said. Over all, 60 of 200 steps in design and production have been automated or eliminated, reducing work time by 530,000 hours over three years, G.E. estimates.Not all the start-up ideas that G.E. is trying to breed translate comfortably to heavy industry. Lean proponents urge companies to come up with \u201cminimum viable products,\u201d particularly test versions of software programs. But no one wants a minimum viable jet engine or power generator.Yet in Greenville, engineers in the design stages are encouraged to move faster in smaller steps, conduct more experiments, and be willing to fail and try again. It amounts to a sea change in the engineering culture of heavy industry.\u201cAs an engineer, not getting it right the first time, I find painful,\u201d said Bill Byrne, an engineering manager. \u201cIt\u2019s uncomfortable. But it\u2019s been incredibly liberating.\u201dThe old ways, said Mr. Lammas, the engineering chief, had merit. Each step and rule was logical on its own. But the emphasis on flawless execution and perfection fostered a fear of failure. \u201cOvercoming that culture was probably the biggest challenge,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

And competitors with deep pockets from all over the world are waiting to cheer if you happen to fail.Lyft, the second-biggest ride-hailing company in the United States behind Uber, is grappling with those forces \u2014 but has found that its options are limited.The company, which is based in San Francisco, has in recent months held talks or made approaches to sell itself to companies including General Motors, Apple, Google, Amazon, Uber and Didi Chuxing, according to a dozen people who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. One person said it was Lyft who was approached by interested parties.Lyft\u2019s discussions were most serious with G.M., which is one of the ride-hailing company\u2019s largest investors. Still, G.M. never made a written offer to buy Lyft, said the people, and in the end, Lyft did not find a buyer.Lyft is not in danger of closing down and has a cash cushion of $1.4 billion, some of these people added, so the company will continue as an independent entity.Still, the talks underline how difficult it has become to operate in the ride-hailing market, where people can book rides from drivers through a smartphone app. While ride-hailing companies do not own fleets of cars and instead rely on drivers who have their own vehicles, the business is highly capital-intensive. Venture capitalists and other investors have poured billions of dollars into the companies.Lyft, a four-year-old company founded by Logan Green and John Zimmer, sprang out of an early long-distance car-pooling program, then called Zimride, in 2007. The goal, the two co-founders have said, was to create a new kind of social ride-sharing, an attempt to decrease the number of cars on the road and to improve congestion, reduce humanity\u2019s environmental footprint and create more efficiency in transportation.That idea has turned into a global movement, as companies worldwide \u2014 like Grab in Southeast Asia, Ola in India, BlaBlaCar in Europe and Uber \u2014 look to upend the global transportation infrastructure.The effort to sell Lyft was aided by bankers at Qatalyst Partners, the boutique investment bank founded by the veteran Silicon Valley banker Frank Quattrone, said the people with knowledge of the talks. Qatalyst declined to comment.Lyft also struggled to find a buyer because of the challenging economics of the ride-hailing business. Companies like Lyft and Uber typically take 20 percent to 25 percent of the cost of each ride. With Lyft drivers expected to pick up an estimated $2 billion or so in fares this year, that meant Lyft\u2019s annual revenue would be about $400 million, according to a person familiar with the company\u2019s financials.That $400 million shrinks after marketing costs are factored in. To win loyalty from drivers who can also work for Uber, Lyft also sometimes lets drivers keep that 20 percent to 25 percent of some rides, so the company effectively earns no revenue in those situations. And in some cases, Lyft provides drivers with additional cash incentives simply to get out on the road, adding to its costs.\u201cOne of the challenges for these companies is to figure out how to grow and sustain that latent demand for these businesses, but also to eventually become profitable,\u201d said Susan Shaheen, co-director of the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cPart of the challenge in evolving those services is just balancing out those factors. And that\u2019s not an easy task.\u201dLyft is not profitable, said a person briefed on the company\u2019s finances. Yet it has a $1.4 billion cash hoard, the person added, and the company thinks that will shield it as it works toward achieving profitability.Ms. Shaheen said an acquisition might still make sense for ride-hailing companies that needed more resources and a bigger size to compete.\u201cThere isn\u2019t a single company that has all of this expertise \u2014 software, manufacturing, ride-sharing \u2014 under one roof,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s where acquisition comes in.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ronald D. Boire Steps Down as Chief of Barnes & Noble", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a terse statement that lacked any attempt at corporate spin, the company said that \u201cthe board of directors determined that Mr. Boire is not a good fit for the organization and that it was in the best interest of all parties for him to leave the company.\u201d A spokeswoman declined to provide additional comment.Mr. Boire\u2019s sudden departure comes at a critical moment for Barnes & Noble, the country\u2019s largest bookstore chain. In recent years, the company has been battered by Amazon\u2019s rise as a leading bookseller and crippled by losses from its Nook e-reader division. Its fleet of retail stores has shrunk to 640 from 720 in the last six years.Mr. Boire, who previously worked in top posts at Sears Canada, Brookstone and Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, tried to transform Barnes & Noble by expanding its selection of games, toys, art supplies and music and by offering coding and 3D printing workshops. On corporate earnings calls, Mr. Boire often talked about how strong sales of coloring books and vinyl records were bolstering revenue.\u201cEverything we do around learning, personal growth and development fits with our brand,\u201d he said in an interview with The New York Times in December.There were some encouraging signs of stability. The company announced plans to open four new retail stores in the 2017 fiscal year.But the chain has still struggled to recover from its heavy investments in its Nook e-reader, a device that was meant to give it a foothold in the digital marketplace but ended up hemorrhaging money instead. Mr. Boire\u2019s attempts to turn the company\u2019s fortunes around have largely fallen short. In an earnings report for the final quarter of the current fiscal year, Barnes & Noble reported a loss of $30.6 million, or 42 cents a share, compared to losses of $19.4 million, or 37 cents a share, in the same period the previous year. Revenue dropped 3.7 percent to $876.7 million during the period, while Nook sales tumbled 20 percent.Perhaps most troubling, Barnes & Noble\u2019s troubles have persisted even as many other physical book retailers, particularly independent bookstores, have flourished. Sales of books in physical stores grew 1.8 percent, to $4.15 billion, in 2015 compared to 2014, according to the Association of American Publishers. Print book sales have rebounded as well: revenues from hardcover books rose by 8.3 percent last year, while e-book unit sales fell by 9.7 percent.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Macy\u2019s to Close 100 Stores as E-Rivals and Discounting Hit Legacy Retailers", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "Supported byFor legacy stores, the fallout from this shift has been profound, perhaps never more apparent than this week. Macy\u2019s, the country\u2019s largest department store, said on Thursday that it would close 100 stores, saying they were more valuable as real estate properties. Walmart, the world\u2019s largest retailer, announced on Monday that it would buy a small online rival for more than $3 billion. The hope is that the deal will reverse its sputtering online growth.Other retailers have taken aggressive action, too, trying to turn their fortunes around. Billions of dollars have been poured into e-commerce efforts. Stores have turned to sharp discounting, temporarily lifting sales but hurting profits and upsetting partners.But almost always, these efforts have led to mediocre results. And the decisions by Walmart and Macy\u2019s, two towering figures in the industry, have sent a clear message: The pressure to keep up with customers is at a boiling point.\u201cThese legacy players are having a terrible time navigating through that shift successfully,\u201d said Mark A. Cohen, the director of retail studies at Columbia Business School.For decades, Americans have relied on the country\u2019s dense footprint of shopping centers and department stores for their prom dresses, paper towels and everything in between. Often, they were willing to drive to the mall, pay full price or wait for annual sales to get a deal.But that has been transformed in the last decade, with the meteoric rise of the online giant Amazon, discount and low-cost stores like T. J. Maxx gaining popularity, and a long recession that reset the value of a dollar.\u201cGiven the convenience of e-commerce, the consumer needs a really good reason to go to a store and park their car,\u201d said Edward Yruma, a managing director at KeyBanc Capital Markets. \u201cIt has to be exciting and have something new, because if not, why wouldn\u2019t I sit on my couch in my pajamas and shop on my iPad?\u201dFor retailers, that new reality is playing out in a variety of ways. Some, like Sports Authority, have thrown up their hands and closed. Others, like Express, have started opening outlet stores in regular malls.T. J. Maxx, Marshalls and outlet stores have boomed by loudly advertising big savings over their full-priced department store rivals, spurring some to create their own versions. Nordstrom long ago created Nordstrom Rack, for example, while Macy\u2019s recently introduced Macy\u2019s Backstage. But in many cases, heavy discounts and lower-priced offshoots have eroded the power of traditional stars to lure in shoppers.The situations at Macy\u2019s and Walmart, and their reactions this week, capture the large forces at play, and the sense that major changes need to be made to thrive.Walmart is already a discount behemoth, with 4,627 stores in the United States, but it has not been able to duplicate its dominance online. It isn\u2019t for lack of trying. The company has dedicated its deep pockets to the effort, building a large engineering outpost in Silicon Valley, the heart of the tech industry.But like other discount retailers, it has been unable to convert its vast network of warehouses and stores into a seamless and highly profitable online enterprise. In some ways, the ease of its online shopping site also lags those of some tech competitors. While Walmart is the second largest online retailer, it is far behind Amazon, which has an efficient network of distribution centers and a robust, standard-setting site.\u201cSomething drastic had to be done,\u201d said Bernard Sosnick, a retail analyst at Madison Global Partners.That something was buying Jet.com, an unprofitable, year-old start-up, for about $3 billion, the biggest e-commerce acquisition ever in the United States. Jet offers Walmart an edge in the online bulk-buying space. It also gives it Marc Lore, a founder of Jet who is widely considered a top e-commerce executive. Another company he helped start, Quidsi.com, was sold to Amazon for more than $500 million.\u201cNone of these traditional brick-and-mortar retailers feel like they can move fast enough to stave off the competition,\u201d said Liz Dunn, chief executive of Talmage Advisors, a retail consulting firm.As companies like Sears and J. C. Penney experienced long and fast declines, Macy\u2019s had often been held up as one of the few retailers that had managed to withstand the new environment. But it, too, now feels pressure on multiple fronts.It faces major competition from online sites like Amazon, which is beginning to make inroads in apparel. The biggest threat, though, comes from discount chains like T. J. Maxx, some of which have little online presence.The challenges have put heavy shareholder pressure on the company. Shares in the stock have fallen more than 40 percent in the last 12 months. In June, the company announced that Jeffrey Gennette, its president and a longtime Macy\u2019s executive, would replace Terry J. Lundgren as chief executive next year.As the share price has fallen, investors have pressured Macy\u2019s to sell some of its real estate. Macy\u2019s closed 41 stores in its last fiscal year, and said on Thursday that it was in talks to sell its men\u2019s store on San Francisco\u2019s Union Square.The store closings were announced along with quarterly earnings, in which Macy\u2019s reported that profits fell to $11 million last quarter, down from $217 million in the same period last year. Sales fell 3.9 percent, to $5.87 billion.Investors were clearly upbeat about the overall message, though. The stock rose more than 17 percent on Thursday.Macy\u2019s currently operates 728 stores, including 675 full-line locations. It did not specify which stores would close. And it said it did not know how many employees would be laid off, but said that it would offer severance to full- and part-time workers.\u201cFor Macy\u2019s, they still believe in stores. They\u2019re just acknowledging that a lot of the business has shifted online and away from some lower-quality malls,\u201d Ms. Dunn said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Small Cloud Computing Firm Turns to Helping Others Work With Giants", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsApollo Global Management and Searchlight Capital are making a $4.3 billion bet on capitulation.Apollo, the private-equity company run by Leon Black, is leading a deal to take Rackspace, a cloud computing company, private after it struggled to compete with Amazon, Microsoft and other technology giants. If Rackspace\u2019s strategic shift to sell services on these platforms succeeds, Apollo will have a nice payday.About 70 percent of Rackspace\u2019s revenue comes from managing server farms for individual companies. That is a stable but relatively low-growth business. The excitement has come from its public cloud operations, where it competes against Amazon Web Services and Microsoft\u2019s Azure, selling on-demand computing and services.The problem is this is a business of scale. Bigger companies can negotiate to buy servers and power for less, and deploy gear more effectively. So Amazon and Microsoft can offer better deals to customers without suffering a big hit to margins.Rackspace is trying a bit of jujitsu. While it is not abandoning its efforts, the company realizes it cannot effectively compete with Amazon and Microsoft. So it has become a partner, selling services and helping companies connect their data and software to Amazon Web Services and Azure. There is an additional benefit to Apollo. It takes a lot less capital to offer consulting services than to build and run server farms.There is risk. While its existing business of managing server farms for individual businesses probably will provide enough cash flow to cover costs and service debt, success will rely on its new partnerships taking off. That may not happen. Customers may wonder whether it makes sense to pay for additional support and services, especially as Amazon and Microsoft continually make their web services easier to use. The growth of cloud computing, however, may mean there\u2019s plenty of room on the Amazon and Microsoft bandwagons.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Think Amazon\u2019s Drone Delivery Idea Is a Gimmick? Think Again", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtAmazon is the most obscure large company in the tech industry.It isn\u2019t just secretive, the way Apple is, but in a deeper sense, Jeff Bezos\u2019 e-commerce and cloud-storage giant is opaque. Amazon rarely explains either its near-term tactical aims or its long-term strategic vision. It values surprise.To understand Amazon, then, is necessarily to engage in a kind of Kremlinology. That\u2019s especially true of the story behind one of its most important business areas: the logistics by which it ships orders to its customers.So what\u2019s Amazon\u2019s ultimate aim in delivery? After talking to analysts, partners and competitors, and prying some very minimal input from Amazon itself, I suspect the company has a two-tiered vision for the future of shipping.First, it\u2019s not trying to replace third-party shippers. Instead, over the next few years, Amazon wants to add as much capacity to its operations as possible, and rather than replace partners like UPS and FedEx, it is spending boatloads on planes, trucks, crowdsourcing and other novel delivery services to add to its overall capacity and efficiency.Amazon\u2019s longer-term goal is more fantastical \u2014 and, if it succeeds, potentially transformative. It wants to escape the messy vicissitudes of roads and humans. It wants to go fully autonomous, up in the sky. The company\u2019s drone program, which many in the tech press dismissed as a marketing gimmick when Mr. Bezos unveiled it on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in 2013, is central to this future; drones could be combined with warehouses manned by robots and trucks that drive themselves to unlock a new autonomous future for Amazon.If Amazon\u2019s drone program succeeds (and Amazon says it is well on track), it could fundamentally alter the company\u2019s cost structure. A decade from now, drones would reduce the unit cost of each Amazon delivery by about half, analysts at Deutsche Bank projected in a recent research report. If that happens, the economic threat to competitors would be punishing \u2014 \u201cretail stores would cease to exist,\u201d Deutsche\u2019s analysts suggested, and we would live in a world more like that of \u201cThe Jetsons\u201d than our own.Shipping has always been at the core of Amazon\u2019s strategic investments. In its earliest days, as part of an effort to avoid collecting sales tax from most customers, Amazon purposefully placed warehouses in low-tax, low-population states, and then shipped goods to populous areas within three to five days.As consumer and commercial drones increase in popularity, the government is taking more steps to address safety concerns and regulate the aerial vehicles.The 2005 introduction of Amazon\u2019s Prime subscription program, which gives customers two-day delivery on many goods for an annual price of $99, changed Amazon\u2019s shipping needs. Prime encouraged customers to buy a lot more stuff, and it also forced Amazon to deliver packages more quickly.For Amazon, that projected future is catastrophic: Pretty much all of Amazon\u2019s current investments in shipping \u2014 in trucks, planes and crowdsourced delivery cars \u2014 depend on the traditional shipping infrastructure.All, that is, except for drones \u2014 which explains why they are integral to Amazon\u2019s vision of the future of retail.When I began talking to others in the drone industry about Amazon\u2019s interest in autonomous flight, they all pointed out that drones offer a way to leapfrog roads. Because they operate in a new, untrammeled layer of physical space \u2014 below 400 feet, an airspace that is currently unoccupied in most of the country \u2014 they open up a vast new shipping lane.Scenes like that are most likely in the far-off future. But according to Amazon, the earliest incarnation of drone deliveries will happen much sooner \u2014 we will see it within five years, somewhere in the world.Email: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Giants Gobble Start-Ups in an Antitrust Blind Spot", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDeal ProfessorLike Facebook\u2019s acquisition of WhatsApp, the Walmart deal will probably end up being another example of an upstart internet company being swallowed up to preserve the stranglehold of a giant.This happens because antitrust regulators are stuck in an outdated view of the world, while the internet giants are more attuned to their nascent competitive threats. The deal for Jet.com is just the latest defensive internet acquisition of an emerging start-up that will preserve the hegemony of a select few.And now it is being swallowed up by Walmart.This could be seen as a victory for competition. Walmart will now have a more dynamic management and brand to buttress its own internet sales operation, which trails Amazon by quite a distance. This will allow it to better compete against Amazon. The likely result is that competition in online retailing will eventually be a slugfest between Amazon and Walmart with everyone else thrown by the wayside.The problem with this narrative is that it cements the positions of Walmart and Amazon as the only players in town.This is the modus operandi of the big internet behemoths. They live in fear of new technology disrupting their businesses and killing them off.Mr. Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez was a Facebook product manager when the company faced its greatest threat: Google Plus. Facebook won because it enforced an ethos of all work, all the time, spurred by constant fear of extinction.Facebook and its elite brethren will do anything to make sure they are not the next Yahoo or Radio Shack, killed by disruption and failure to innovate. This translates into paying obscene sums for technology that might challenge their dominance one day.If you don\u2019t believe this, there is a poignant passage in \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d where Mr. Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez notes that Mark Zuckerberg saw that there were two companies with \u201chockey stick growth\u201d that matched Facebook\u2019s own: Instagram and WhatsApp. Both were amassing users at an amazing rate and both were an existential threat to Facebook.Did Mr. Zuckerberg rev up the Facebook machine to try to outcompete them? No. Instead, he bought Instagram for about $1 billion and WhatsApp for an astounding $21.8 billion.Today, Facebook is dominant, with more than 1.7 billion monthly active users. WhatsApp has more than 1 billion monthly active users and Instagram, more than 500 million.Another Google example is YouTube, which was bought for $1.65 billion in 2006 and is now a constant stream of users for Google. Indeed, YouTube, with more than one billion active monthly users, is a top driver of Alphabet\u2019s user growth.Billions of dollars are made in Silicon Valley by selling nascent upstarts to the giants. And the dominant players pay eagerly to remain dominant. That is what is going on with the Jet.com acquisition and perhaps even the $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn by Microsoft.Where are the antitrust authorities in all of this? The guiding standard under the law is that no acquisition should be allowed if it would \u201clessen competition.\u201dUnder the traditional view of antitrust, when Facebook, for example, tries to buy a company like Instagram, it can argue that anyone can start such a website. And there are other competitors like Google and Snapchat. And so this gets past the antitrust authorities, who seem more concerned with how the data will be used rather than the accumulation of users. Both United States and European Union regulators examined the WhatsApp deal, but it passed muster because WhatsApp was viewed as a messenger service, something where there was alternative competition.This misses the point that domination is all about users and views. Those companies with users and page views can dominate, and accumulating those users is everything, something only an infinitesimally small number of companies can find the key to doing.The antitrust system results in the increasing oligopoly that we have, where a few companies dominate major industries, accruing the wealth and power that go with it as potential disrupters are swallowed at birth, the way Cronus, the titan in Greek mythology, ate his young to prevent their uprising.No one knows what might happen to Jet if it remained independent. Perhaps it would fail. Amazon is dominant and Walmart may truly be the only real competitor. The same could be said of any of these acquisitions of high-growth companies. So preventing this acquisition may result not in creating a competitor to Amazon but in the eventual death of Jet. This of course would leave its founder and investors much poorer, a true cost.The flip side of this risk is that the big tech companies continue unchallenged in their dominance. Perhaps it is time to rethink antitrust enforcement, and take the risks associated with a different view of antitrust that looks at potential dominance and at breaking up oligopolies. Rhea protected Zeus from Cronus, which eventually led to Cronus\u2019s destruction.If antitrust authorities do not adapt and emerging competitors continue to be bought up, we should not be surprised of the continued dominance of a very few companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Walmart.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Daily Report: More Clean Energy, Brought to You by the Cloud", "Date": "2016-08-24", "News": "Supported byBitsThe cloud, as it turns out, may have a very green lining.A prime reason for this is the growing demand from its cloud computing centers, where Apple keeps its customers\u2019 music, photos and much more.On this front, Apple joins a number of other cloud providers, who collectively may change the face of energy production by increasing demand for renewable energy.Big cloud-computing companies are building facilities on an unparalleled scale, and at a time when few others are increasing demand. Dominion Virginia Power, which supplies perhaps the world\u2019s greatest concentration of data centers, reported that overall demand rose 1 percent last year, but demand from data centers rose 9 percent.Amazon Web Services has since committed to obtaining 100 percent of its power from renewable sources. Last year the company purchased a 250,000-panel, 80-megawatt plant in Virginia, which it later sold to Dominion.Other data centers have long been situated near big dams, which provide cheap as well as green power. Lots of building is happening in Iowa, Texas and elsewhere in America\u2019s great wind corridor, to encourage the construction of more wind-driven facilities.Remote locations have other benefits. \u201cWhen your nearest neighbor is 100 acres away, you don\u2019t get as many complaints about the power lines,\u201d said Joe Kava, who heads Google\u2019s data center operations.There are signs it is affecting the way utilities plan future construction. American Electric Power, which operates in 11 states, has said it will add 6,300 megawatts of new wind power and 3,100 megawatts of new solar generation before 2033. An AEP official told me that much of this was attributable to demand from data centers.For many of these companies, it\u2019s not just about saving the planet; power has moved from an incidental cost to a main determinant of profitability. Like nothing else, that has affected the operation of data centers in ways that may improve other big companies\u2019 power consumption.The traditional measure of data center efficiency is power usage effectiveness, or P.U.E. This measures how much power goes into a data center and how much of that is used by computing equipment. For a poorly run center, this number can be 2.0 or higher, meaning it takes two watts of power to put one watt into a computer.Together, these companies are building with their clouds a new kind of industrial infrastructure. It would be something if it also reshaped our power usage for the better.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Games End, Rio Celebrates While Looking Warily to Future", "Date": "2016-08-21", "News": "Supported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The skies opened on Sunday night over Maracan\u00e3, the stadium where Brazil bade farewell to the Rio Olympics with a spectacle celebrating everything from the giants of Brazilian music to the rock art drawn by tribesmen thousands of years ago, as if the heavens were lamenting the end of the 17-day sports extravaganza.Nodding to Brazil\u2019s diversity as Latin America\u2019s largest country, the ceremony also honored facets of an astonishingly rich musical heritage that are often overlooked, promoting As Ganhadeiras de Itapu\u00e3, a group of former washerwomen rescuing Afro-Brazilian songs in northeast Brazil, as well as Arnaldo Antunes, a poet and vocalist who once sang for Tit\u00e3s, a pioneering S\u00e3o Paulo rock band.Despite widespread fears that the city would be unprepared, or that crime and disorganization might turn the Olympics into a national embarrassment, many Brazilians came to view the Games as a triumph and a much-needed distraction from the country\u2019s economic malaise and political upheaval.In the days after the opening ceremony, the criticisms that the Games were an inappropriate use of public money at a time of crisis were mostly subsumed by a sense that Brazil had largely met the logistical challenges, delivering the world\u2019s biggest sporting event for the half-million visitors who flocked to Rio for South America\u2019s first Olympics.\u201cWe know the city isn\u2019t an easy place to live in, but Rio flung its arms wide open, and we need to congratulate ourselves for our receptiveness and joy in making such a beautiful party,\u201d said Naid\u00ea Gouv\u00eaa Lira, 45, a logistics analyst.The ebullience was further buoyed on Saturday by the Brazilian soccer team\u2019s win over Germany, a victory that yielded one of the country\u2019s seven gold medals in the Games and helped ease the sting of its humiliating 2014 World Cup loss to the Germans.14 PhotosOver all, Brazilians seemed satisfied with their relatively modest medal count, which placed the country among the top 14 nations, its best Olympic showing ever. Many are still savoring their first gold of the Rio Games, won in judo by Rafaela Silva, 24, a black woman from an impoverished part of Rio.\u201cTo see her win really lifted our spirits,\u201d said Fabio Costa dos Santos, 47, an unemployed carpenter who, like Silva, hails from City of God, a favela in the city\u2019s western suburbs.The Games were far from trouble free. Even after the authorities deployed an 85,000-strong security force to ease crime fears, Portugal\u2019s education minister was robbed at knifepoint. An Olympic bus carrying journalists was attacked by people throwing rocks.Outside the Olympic bubble, gun battles between the police and drug gangs in Complexo do Alem\u00e3o, a collection of favelas, the poor urban areas that emerged as squatter settlements, were a stubborn reminder of the untamed violence and yawning inequities in a city that officials had promised would be the world\u2019s safest during the Games.A police officer deployed to Rio for the Games was killed when the vehicle he was in came under fire in a favela controlled by drug gangs. The killing of the officer, H\u00e9lio Vieira Andrade, from Roraima State in the Brazilian Amazon, focused scrutiny on Rio\u2019s priorities during the Olympics.\u201cThere wasn\u2019t even a tear shed for him in the ocean that was the Olympics,\u201d Fernando Gabeira, a politician and writer, said, noting the contrast with emotions expressed around the victories and defeats of Brazil\u2019s athletes.Transportation gridlock frustrated visitors as they rushed between events on opposite sides of a sprawling metropolis. And many people complained about the glaring sight of empty seats, even at the closing ceremony, partly the result of unsold tickets that proved unaffordable to the working poor.The organizers seemed to stumble on several fronts, at least early on. Long security lines and shortages of food at some sites left spectators grumbling. A mysterious green tint in the diving and water polo pools was highly embarrassing.Here is a breakdown of all the medals awarded and the athletes who have competed at each Olympics, starting with the 1896 Games in Athens. The schedule for the Games in Rio de Janeiro and all the medal winners there are also listed.Still, 57 percent of Brazilians said that the Olympics had generated a more positive image of the country around the world, according to Ibope. The poll, conducted from Aug. 11 to 15 in interviews with 2,002 people, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus two percentage points.Those mixed feelings produced something of a paradox: a \u201cwasteful event that worked out,\u201d in the words of Jos\u00e9 Roberto de Toledo, a columnist for the newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo, who analyzed the poll.Still, many of the worst fears proved unfounded. Zika, the mosquito-borne virus that prompted some foreign athletes to stay home, was largely forgotten as the Games got underway.So, too, were anxieties over a potential terrorist attack. And while the state government failed to meet promises that it would clean up the sewage-infested Guanabara Bay, boating competitions took place without any collisions between sailors and floating sofas.Anderson Gurgel, a sports researcher at Mackenzie Presbyterian University in S\u00e3o Paulo, commended the organizers for dealing with the unexpected problems, although he said they were sometimes slow to act.\u201cEvery event of this size has problems; the issue is how to manage them,\u201d Gurgel said. \u201cBrazilians need to learn things won\u2019t always go wrong, that there won\u2019t always be chaos.\u201dStill, the closing ceremony exuded simplicity while lacking the over-the-top dazzle of other Olympic spectacles, creating a buoyant atmosphere inside Maracan\u00e3 by mixing performances by contemporary musicians like Lenine with homages for giants of Brazilian culture like the composer Luiz Gonzaga. Athletes paraded under the rain to the samba tunes.The Rio Games will also be remembered for a debacle that was not of its own making: the false claims by the American swimmer Ryan Lochte that he and some of his teammates had been pulled over and robbed at gunpoint by men describing themselves as police officers.On Saturday, Lochte tried to put the controversy to rest by admitting that he had exaggerated the details of the incident. \u201cI let my team down,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cI learned my lesson.\u201dStill, the victory of Brazil\u2019s national soccer team over Germany\u2019s allowed many in the country to pivot from the episode involving the swimmers. Globo, Brazil\u2019s dominant television network, luxuriated in the conquest of the soccer gold medal, devoting the bulk of its nightly news program to the triumph.But even amid the celebrations, the rising polarization of Brazil\u2019s unruly if functioning democracy was on display.Indeed, the sense of reverie will be tested in the coming weeks as Brazilians confront the ugly realities of surging unemployment, rampant corruption and the intensifying political drama in the capital, Bras\u00edlia.The respite will be brief: In the coming days, Brazil\u2019s Senate will start its trial of Ms. Rousseff on charges that she illegally manipulated the federal budget. Michel Temer, the interim president, did not event attend the closing spectacle after he was greeted with a chorus of boos during the opening ceremony.For Rio residents, the intoxicating mood of the past two weeks will inevitably give way to an array of challenges: the inadequate sewage-treatment system, the growing poverty and a broken state government unable to pay thousands of civil servants on time. Rio\u2019s mayor, Eduardo Paes, who hitched his political fortunes to the organization of the Games, was booed when he appeared on stage Sunday night, a reception that stood in contrast to the applause for Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who appeared to mark the transition to the next Summer Olympics in Tokyo in 2020.Most worrisome, many say, is what happens after the tens of thousands of soldiers and military police personnel who were dispatched to Rio for the Games go back to their home states. A last-minute cash infusion from the federal government helped finance the surge in security, but a police union official has warned of strikes should the city\u2019s police force go unpaid.Elizabeth Rezende, 61, a retired maid, said she was bracing for a return of the status quo. \u201cSure, the Games have been a good thing for Rio, but once they are over, poor people like us will be back in hell,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be locked in our homes while the criminals roam the streets with impunity.\u201dPaula Moura and Anna Jean Kaiser contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Big Pause You Should Take Before Co-Signing a Student Loan", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneySo someone has asked you to co-sign for a student loan.Chances are, it\u2019s your child or grandchild, or perhaps a niece or nephew. You have unrelenting faith in this teenage freshman, or near certainty that graduate school will lead to a lifetime of gainful employment. And maybe you feel badly that the family has not been able to save enough to pay the bills outright.Fine. But be very, very careful.When you co-sign for a loan, you, too, are responsible for it. If the primary borrower can\u2019t pay, you have to. If that borrower pays late, your credit could get nicked as well. And the mere existence of the loan on your credit report may keep you from being able to get other kinds of loans, since lenders don\u2019t always want to do business with people who already have a lot of debt.The $102 billion in outstanding private student loans make up just 7.5 percent of the $1.36 trillion in total student loan debt; the rest is made up of federal student loans. Undergraduates, however, can borrow only so much each year from the federal government before hitting limits.Most private lenders require borrowers to have a co-signer to get a loan at all or to get a better rate. During the 2015-16 academic year, 94 percent of new undergraduate private loans had a co-signer, while 61 percent of graduate school loans did, according to MeasureOne\u2019s analysis of data from six large lenders that make up about two-thirds of the overall market.For graduate students, the numbers were 4.59 percent for duos and 6.21 percent for people going it alone. For its average undergraduate loan \u2014 $19,232, paid off in eight years \u2014 the savings over time would be $1,896, which comes to about $20 a month.A guide to student loans at various universities, and what it takes after graduation to repay that debt.But Sallie Mae said that more than half of its borrowers who make this request succeed. For PNC, the figure was 45 percent for the last 12 months. Citizens Bank reported a 64 percent number, while Wells Fargo said so few people had asked for a release that it did not track the number. (It\u2019s possible that many don\u2019t know that it\u2019s possible, as the bureau chided lenders for not making the rules clear.)What accounts for this gap? The bureau\u2019s sample includes many loans that the original lenders sold to investors. These anonymous loan owners may not have the same incentive to be customer-friendly as big-name banks.Some co-signers can\u2019t get a release because the primary borrower doesn\u2019t have sufficient income or a good enough credit score \u2014 fair and square. But sometimes it\u2019s neither fair nor square. The bureau reports numerous instances where people make several months\u2019 worth of payments in a lump sum but then don\u2019t get credit for the consecutive monthly payments that some lenders use to keep score on people who are aiming to release their co-signers.Worse still, co-signers who make payments themselves may discover after the fact that the lender requires the primary borrower to make years of on-time monthly payments before it will consider a release. So efforts by the co-signer to help the primary borrower stay on track may foil their very attempt to get themselves off the loan later.There are rarer horrors, too, where the death or the bankruptcy of the co-signer causes an automatic default, according to the bureau. At that point, a mourning child can receive a bill for the full balance, and debt collectors may chase after the executor of the estate for a dead grandfather who co-signed a loan years ago. The big banks that offer private student loans say they do no such things.As for more likely events, like credit-sullying late payments, just 4.37 percent of borrowers were at least 30 days late on their loans at the end of the first quarter, according to MeasureOne\u2019s look at the big private lenders. But it\u2019s not necessarily the same 4.37 percent who are overdue at any given moment. Moreover, that number will go higher during the next downturn, and there might be more than one bad economic cycle during any individual\u2019s tenure as a co-signer.So where does this leave someone trying to help and tempted to co-sign? The tough-love reply goes like this: If you need a private loan as an undergraduate especially, then your college of choice is simply not affordable. Federal loans plus savings and current income should be enough to pay all of your costs, and if they aren\u2019t, then it\u2019s community college and living at home for you. And no, we won\u2019t take the debt on in our names only or yank money from home equity, since we need to think about retirement and not be a burden to you later.But can you really bring yourself, as a parent in particular, to deny a teenager or an ambitious graduate student a shot at the better opportunities that a more prestigious and expensive school might bring, as long as the debt isn\u2019t outsize? Even an aspiring engineer who will earn plenty?Many people simply will not be able to say no. So a few words for them. First, keep in mind that the teenagers you\u2019re betting on may never graduate. And if they don\u2019t, the odds are higher of the co-signer being liable for the private loan while the college dropout earns a modest hourly wage. So be especially wary if you think there is even a chance that your child or grandchild is not committed to college.Finally, look the primary borrower in the eye and draw out a commitment of total and utter transparency. \u201cDon\u2019t assume that the primary borrower is making the payments, and make sure you have an open enough dialogue that they will tell you about it before they miss that payment,\u201d said Dan Macklin, co-founder of SoFi, a company that helps many people refinance older student loans. \u201cI\u2019ve seen too many people where it\u2019s an embarrassment and not spoken about, and it\u2019s not very healthy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Harambe had already become a weird meme on Twitter, but the Jones attack added another dimension \u2014 basically, Harambe is now a racist trope.I don\u2019t know what to say other than, why are any of us still online, Mike?Clearly there are racists and misogynists all over the web who take great pleasure in knocking famous women down for no reason whatsoever.But perhaps even worse are the hangers-on who do it for no reason \u2014 for \u201cthe lulz,\u201d as one hacker group used to say. It\u2019s this weird code \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 of internet nihilism, a willingness to attack targets just because they\u2019re visible. Ms. Jones did not do anything to provoke this. She\u2019s just herself online. And no one should be the target of an attack just because they have a Twitter account.In an unrelated matter, please never look at my Twitter account.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Helps Develop Software That Puts Students in Charge of Their Lesson Plans", "Date": "2016-08-09", "News": "Supported byPriscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook, last month. They were the catalysts for Facebook\u2019s partnership to build classroom software with Summit Public Schools.Facebook is out to upend the traditional student-teacher relationship.Rather than have teachers hand out class assignments, the Facebook-Summit learning management system puts students in charge of selecting their projects and setting their pace. The idea is to encourage students to develop skills, like resourcefulness and time management, that might help them succeed in college.\u201cAs parents and kids and teachers get access to this type of learning, I think more and more will want it,\u201d Diane Tavenner, the co-founder and chief executive of Summit Public Schools, said in a telephone interview.But the Summit-Facebook system, called the \u201cSummit Personalized Learning Platform,\u201d is different.The software gives students a full view of their academic responsibilities for the year in each class and breaks them down into customizable lesson modules they can tackle at their own pace. A student working on a science assignment, for example, may choose to create a project using video, text or audio files. Students may also work asynchronously, tackling different sections of the year\u2019s work at the same time.The system inverts the traditional teacher-led classroom hierarchy, requiring schools to provide intensive one-on-one mentoring and coaching to help each student adapt.This summer, more than 1,500 educators and leaders of public, private and charter schools participating in the program, called Summit Basecamp, attended sessions to learn how to use the system. Among the 19 schools that introduced the new learning approach last year, at least a few educators and administrators reported a steep learning curve.\u201cThere were many points where we weren\u2019t sure the Summit Basecamp model was what our students needed,\u201d said Claire Fisher, the principal of Urban Promise Academy, a public middle school in Oakland, Calif., which introduced the platform in its sixth-grade classes.By the end of the school year, however, 31 percent of the school\u2019s sixth graders were reading at or above their grade level, compared with just 9 percent in the fall. That was a larger improvement in reading than students in seventh and eighth grades, which did not use the platform, Ms. Fisher said.Advertisement"}

Synchronized Swimming Themes Can Be Mystifying", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "Supported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Down in the pool, the Australian synchronized swimming duo was performing a three-minute whistle-stop tour of the animals of the outback \u2014 kookaburras, emus, centipedes \u2014 to music from \u201cCrocodile Dundee.\u201d In the stands, the American mother-daughter duo of Ruth and Emily Thunstrum was trying to figure out what, exactly, was going on.\u201cThere was definitely a bird of some kind,\u201d Emily said.\u201cI think there was a crocodile,\u201d Ruth answered. \u201cYou should know \u2014 you spent that time in Australia.\u201dYou do not have to be from someplace other than Australia to be mystified by synchronized swimming, a sport that lies in the corner of the Twilight Zone where Kabuki opera meets advanced underwater survival. It may look as if the athletes are simply gesticulating emphatically, flinging themselves around in improbable aquatic configurations, and executing shockingly complex leg movements while upside down and not breathing. But that\u2019s not the half of it.Each synchro routine also has an elaborate theme, and each theme must be conveyed with grace, precision and dramatically relevant facial gestures, as well as moves like the catalina rotation (rotate your body while holding your leg, ballet-style, in the air) and the vertical descent (descend, straight upside down, until your toes are submerged). The athletes also have to do each move at the same time and make it seem fun and not hard at all, even when they are heaving, hypoxic and about to pass out.Sometimes the themes are obvious and careworn: Every competition seems to include at least one \u201cSwan Lake\u201d (hello, Austria). They can also be hideously ill conceived.One strange feature of the sport is that despite all the attention lavished on the themes, even the judges cannot always work out what they are.\u201cNot all the judges get the story,\u201d said Irene Hawes, a longtime synchro judge.Take the \u201cFirebird\u201d suite by Stravinsky, she said. \u201cThere\u2019s the phoenix rising and the battle and all that. A lot of people don\u2019t know that.\u201dShe continued, \u201cI remember one routine was meant to be a tumbleweed, and the athletes were rolling along the deck, and people were wondering what they were doing.\u201d She figured it out, she said, only when the competition ended and \u201cthe country handed out a flier.\u201dStill, synchro athletes said, the narratives help both them and the spectators.\u201cIt\u2019s much more interesting to watch a routine that has a specific theme in it,\u201d said Bianca Hammett, captain of the Australian synchro team.She said the team\u2019s free routine was \u201ca journey through the unique flora and fauna of Australia.\u201d It features both the obvious (crocodiles: athletes\u2019 legs snapping open and shut) and the not.\u201cWe have a lizards\u2019 dance party,\u201d Hammett said. \u201cWe put our hands near our heads, like we\u2019re mimicking lizards.\u201dMany synchro teams pick themes celebrating their countries. The Spanish duo in Rio is doing a Flamenco routine while the Brazilians are depicting natural life in the Amazon. Britain is representing snakes (always popular, because of their watery sinuousness); the Kazakhs, ravens. The Swiss theme is \u201cOrient bazaar,\u201d whatever that means, while the French, with renewed Gallic ambition, have selected \u201cAfrica.\u201d The Russians, who almost always win, are modestly pretending to be mermaids.Another challenge: The choreography has to fit the music.\u201cIf you used a ballet but did, like, robot-type movements, we would see it as strange,\u201d Hawes said. \u201cSame thing if it has a crescendo and you\u2019re doing absolutely nothing but laying on your back. If it has a winding type of sound, which wants spinning, and you\u2019re doing marches \u2014 these are factors.\u201dEvery judge has pet peeves. Many people at the 2012 London Games did not care for Canada\u2019s team program, which looked more like an Esther Williams extravaganza than a sports routine and which Hawes denounced as \u201cgross.\u201d13 Photos\u201cIt had to do with their headgear \u2014 large swimming caps covered with plastic flowers \u2014 their extreme facial moves, and the spitting of water,\u201d Hawes said.As for Linda Loehndorf, another judge \u2014 spare her the circus programs.\u201cIt\u2019s like, ugh,\u201d she said. \u201cI get it. You\u2019re a clown. You don\u2019t need to stick your tongue out at me.\u201dAnd then there are particularly memorable performances. Last year, for instance, China unveiled an electrifying routine that at first seemed destined for clich\u00e9 corner.\u201cI thought, Oh, jeez, not that again \u2014 \u2018The Phantom of the Opera,\u2019\u201d Loehndorf said. \u201cIt\u2019s something you hear over and over again. But they managed to tell the whole story in four and a half minutes, and I got it completely. It was a goosebumps-on-the-arms sort of thing.\u201dAnd people still speak with awe about Spain\u2019s daring 2009 performance to \u201cStairway to Heaven,\u201d the cryptic song that launched a thousand sweaty slow dances.For those who have long been made to wonder, the team\u2019s interpretation of the always challenging \u201cbustle in your hedgerow\u201d lyric offered as plausible an explanation as any. There was a line of athletes lying head-to-toe in the water, arms and legs stretched out, possibly like a hedge wearing a selection of bathing suits; there were two athletes off to the side, performing what was surely a bustle.\u201cIt was gorgeous,\u201d Loehndorf said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "We\u2019re Here! RB Leipzig\u2019s Rise to Bundesliga Isn\u2019t Welcomed by All", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "Supported byLEIPZIG, Germany \u2014 A little more than three years ago, the man in charge of the most ambitious project in European soccer sat in front of a promising young player in a Cypriot hotel and told him the future.At the time, the man, Ralf Rangnick, a well-traveled German coach with an urbane, faintly academic air, seemed an unlikely clairvoyant. And his pitch to Yussuf Poulsen, a young Danish forward, did not seem to be a strong one. Rangnick\u2019s club, RB Leipzig, was attempting to escape the fourth tier of German soccer. It did not have a famous name, or much of a history. His predictions, too, struck Poulsen as distinctly outlandish: promotion all the way to a place among Germany\u2019s elite in just three seasons.\u201cHe said this club was the club of the future,\u201d Poulsen recalled last week.Poulsen signed on, and the rapid ascent Rangnick had laid out in the hotel \u2014 a romantic rise or a cash-fueled corporate push, depending on one\u2019s point of view \u2014 continued.On Sunday, the final part of Rangnick\u2019s prophecy was set to come to pass: Poulsen and his RB Leipzig teammates traveled to Hoffenheim for the club\u2019s first-ever game in the Bundesliga, the completion of its relentless rise. RB Leipzig can now count Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund as its peers. The future, exactly as and when Rangnick predicted it, has arrived.Not everyone in Germany shares Poulsen\u2019s delight at the dawn of the new age. Many in the country recoil from a future in the shape of RB Leipzig, a corporate creation younger than even the most junior players in its academy. Every step of the club\u2019s remarkable rise \u2014 its founding in 2009 and then its moves through the patchwork pitches of the lower leagues to the rarefied air of the elite \u2014 has been taken against a backdrop of controversy and contempt, rancor and rage.Poulsen can reel off all the protests he has witnessed. Some have been violent \u2014 the team\u2019s bus was attacked with stones after his debut, against Hallescher F.C. \u2014 but more often, they have been visual.The problem is encapsulated in the RB Leipzig name. Officially, RB stands for RasenBallsport \u2014 a neologism meaning \u201clawn ball\u201d \u2014 but it takes only one glance at the team, its uniforms, its stadium or its $30 million training base to see through the disguise. To many, RB Leipzig will never be anything more than another marketing venture started by the Austrian energy-drink maker Red Bull.The antipathy dates to the club\u2019s birth. Dietrich Mateschitz, the billionaire Red Bull founder, already had soccer clubs in Salzburg, in his native Austria, and New York, as well as interests in Formula One auto racing and extreme sports.But he had wanted, for some time, to add a German franchise to his slate. He had held talks with teams in Munich, D\u00fcsseldorf and Hamburg, but Leipzig had always been his first choice. It is not hard to see why.There is no major club within 150 miles \u2014 the nearest Bundesliga rival is Hertha Berlin \u2014 and the city, once part of East Germany, is a boomtown known to locals as Hypezig. Leipzig had been extensively remodeled after unification, and its population was expanding, from 450,000 at the end of the 1990s to a projected 600,000 in 2020. A slew of international companies had followed. BMW, DHL, Porsche and Amazon each have a presence in the city; there is a vibrant technology start-up scene, too.The city also had a new stadium, refurbished for the 2006 World Cup, sitting empty. Neither of the two local teams had played in the Bundesliga since 1994; both were now toiling away in the twilight of the semiprofessional lower leagues, their names stained by fan violence and far-right politics.Indeed, East German football in general had withered since the Berlin Wall fell. The year Mateschitz established RB Leipzig \u2014 by buying and rebranding a fifth-division team called SSV Markranst\u00e4dt \u2014 was also the year Energie Cottbus, the last team from the old German Democratic Republic to play at the top level, was relegated. This was a city, and a region, crying out for an elite team.Unlike the English Premier League, though, where outside investors are welcomed and the game\u2019s authorities are officially \u201cownership neutral,\u201d Germany jealously protects what is known as its 50+1 model, in which clubs are regarded as social institutions that must be majority-owned by their members. Red Bull\u2019s arrival ran counter to all that.Out of respect to the rules, the club does have members, but only 17, each of whom pays 800 euros a year (just under $900) for a share. Bayern Munich, by contrast, has more than 224,000 members, at a much more affordable \u20ac60. As with the name, the sleight of hand was interpreted not as a nod to tradition, but as a slap in the face.RB Leipzig acknowledges that the manner of its conception did not make it popular, but its chairman, Oliver Mintzlaff, insisted that only a \u201cminority of hard-core supporters\u201d actively opposed it. That is, perhaps, playing it down a little. Seven years removed from the days when clubs refused to play RB Leipzig, even in friendlies, anger still simmers.Thirty minutes up the road in Halle, home of Hallescher, the club\u2019s ultra fans wear T-shirts bearing the slogan \u201cTradition Hat Einen Namen\u201d: \u201cTradition Has a Name.\u201d Historically, Hallescher\u2019s biggest rival was F.C. Magdeburg. Now, said Julius Kappen, \u201cwe hate RB more.\u201dHe explained: \u201cThey are just money. A team is the colors, the badge, the identity.\u201d\u201cBut look at the name,\u201d said Marko Hofmann, a schoolteacher who volunteers with Lokomotive. \u201cHoffenheim 1899 \u2014 they existed before Hopp. It is the same with Wolfsburg and Leverkusen \u2014 they existed initially to play football. RB is just marketing. It exists only to sell more energy drinks. And what happens if they lose interest, or if Dieter Mateschitz dies? What if they decide to leave the town? Or if they examine the books and say it is not working? What happens then?\u201dThat, those inside RB Leipzig maintain, should not be a worry. Their future, as they see it, rests on being sustainable. Red Bull, according to Mintzlaff, volunteered to sign \u201ccontracts stating a commitment for more than 20 years\u201d with the German league authorities, the D.F.L., while he emphasized the work being done to \u201cbuild a connection\u201d with the city.\u201cNot everyone was happy in the beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cThey wanted to know what this was, what we were doing. But now it feels like part of the city. I love tradition. It is hugely important to our culture. But you must be allowed to start something new, without a tradition. Time is running, time is changing, and we have to be able to move on.\u201dThis is more than just posturing. For all the controversy about the source of the team\u2019s wealth, it is hard to argue with how RB Leipzig has spent it. Its training base is ultramodern, with individual relaxation spaces for the players; a light, airy cafeteria; and an indoor, artificial-turf sprint track to gauge players\u2019 strength and speed.Terrence Boyd, the team\u2019s American forward, described the facilities as \u201camong the best you could find anywhere, a huge draw for the club.\u201dWhat Mintzlaff describes as RB\u2019s \u201cphilosophy,\u201d instituted by Rangnick, centers exclusively on youth. The club tries to sign only players between the ages of 17 and 24, and there is a stated dedication to producing as many young, homegrown prospects as possible. The club is not, Mintzlaff said, \u201cjust buying players.\u201d Its style of play \u2014 indicative of the philosophy of Rangnick, regarded by many as the godfather of the German pressing game \u2014 is attractive and expansive.The city seems to have responded. RB Leipzig has sold about 20,000 season tickets for the coming Bundesliga campaign. \u201cWe could easily have sold 25,000,\u201d Mintzlaff said. Only a handful of the most traditional Bundesliga clubs can match those figures. Mintzlaff says RB Leipzig is proud of the euphoria in the city and the region.The rest of the league, too, is coming around.\u201cI was on a plane with Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, the chief executive of Bayern Munich, on Wednesday,\u201d Mintzlaff said. \u201cHe said, and I agree entirely, that it would be awesome for Bayern to have more competition. The secret of the Premier League is that there are five or six strong teams. Here, it is just Bayern and Dortmund. We need more. It is about having a competitive league, not just one club that wins every year. With the power of Red Bull and a lot of hard work, in a few years, we could help that.\u201dIn the meantime, RB Leipzig\u2019s players have grown used to the hostility, and so have their fans. It has died down over time, if not yet disappeared. \u201cFor a while, Hoffenheim were the enemy of the nation,\u201d said David Grabow, one of the 20,000 to buy a season ticket. \u201cBut after awhile, people have accepted they are here to stay.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hope Solo Struggles in Goal, but U.S. Women\u2019s Soccer Advances", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnited States 2, Colombia 2RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Twenty-five minutes into Tuesday night\u2019s steam bath of a soccer match in the Amazon, Hope Solo stood in front of the United States net, awaiting a free kick by Colombia\u2019s Catalina Usme from about 20 yards away.Usme launched a shot that cleared the wall of United States players and went directly at Solo, who appeared ready to catch the ball against her chest as she fell to her knees. Except that she did not. In one of the more stunning moments in recent years for the United States women\u2019s soccer team, the usually indomitable Solo let the ball slip through her legs and into the net.The blunder, one of the worst of Solo\u2019s long career, gave Colombia a 1-0 lead in a group-stage game that the Americans did not need to win or even tie to advance to the quarterfinals. Still, the mistake was disconcerting for a group seeking to defend its Olympic title from 2012 and add to the luster of its World Cup triumph last summer.As the game progressed, the United States dominated play and recaptured the lead on goals by Crystal Dunn and the 18-year-old Mallory Pugh, but Usme refused to go away.In the 76th minute, with Colombia trailing, 2-1, Usme launched another free kick, this one from further out, and it came close to going into the net, clipping the top of the crossbar just over Solo\u2019s outstretched hand.Thirteen minutes later, Usme had one more chance, on yet another free kick but from an almost impossible angle directly to Solo\u2019s left. Despite the degree of difficulty, Usme launched a curling shot that grazed off the top of Solo\u2019s right hand and, remarkably, right into the net.14 PhotosIt was an impressive feat by Usme, and a questionable moment for Solo, who might have blocked the ball but did not.The outcome was a 2-2 draw that left the Colombian players rejoicing even though they finished last in their group and are going home. For the Americans who rested several players, the score was a blow to their egos and perhaps to Solo\u2019s confidence.Still, the tie allowed the United States to finish first in its group, and it will move on to a quarterfinal match in Bras\u00edlia against Sweden. Many of the American players, including Solo, will be going up against their former coach, Pia Sundhage, who joined Sweden in 2012 after a stint with the United States.Solo did not talk to reporters immediately after Tuesday\u2019s game. She has had a challenging Olympics, booed from the first moments of the first game because of Twitter posts she had made in July. Those posts offended many in Brazil because they appeared to make light of the Zika virus, which can be spread by mosquitoes. One of the posts showed her wearing a beekeeper\u2019s mask, and the other had an array of insect repellents. Brazilians did not think either one was funny.Instead, they have booed Solo whenever she has touched the ball and chanted \u201cZika!\u201d every time she has kicked it downfield. She received that treatment in Belo Horizonte, where the Americans shut out New Zealand and France in the past week, and she got it again Tuesday in Manaus.It is difficult to say whether the jeers have affected Solo. Last Saturday, she was outstanding as the United States won, 1-0, over France, one of the tournament\u2019s tougher teams. Against a much weaker Colombia squad, she was off her game.Solo\u2019s performance Tuesday overshadowed the return of midfielder Megan Rapinoe, who played her first minutes on the field since injuring her knee last December. Rapinoe started, played a little more than 30 minutes and made a couple of deft passes that demonstrated her ability to be the team\u2019s best playmaker.Rapinoe most likely will have a role to play as the team moves into the quarterfinals. And Solo will continue to hear more ridicule from spectators, and she will have to put Tuesday\u2019s game behind her.An earlier version of this article misidentified one of the teams the United States shut out in Belo Horizonte in the past week. It was New Zealand, not Colombia.Advertisement"}

In the dot-com crash of the early 2000s, her family lost the college savings they had been putting aside for her. Her father, a nurse, was laid off after 35 years on the job. Her sister and brother-in-law lost their house during the Great Recession. And very little in the world around Ms. Boshart has led her to feel a sense of comfort and ease: not the soaring costs of living in Seattle, not the whirlwind roar of reinvention in the tech world, certainly not the barbed clamor of national politics.Even for someone who seems to have drawn one of her generation\u2019s winning hands, it feels like a daunting time to be coming of age in America.\u201cI don\u2019t just expect things to unfold, or think, \u2018Well, now I\u2019ve got it made,\u2019 because there\u2019s always a turn just ahead of you and you don\u2019t know what\u2019s around that corner,\u201d she said.On the 10th floor of a downtown office building here on a rainy morning in June, a software development instructor stood in a darkened classroom, the images and words from a screen projection branding his white shirt with the fractured punctuation-mark language of computer code.The students at Ada \u2014 Adies, as they affectionately call one other \u2014 are in many ways representative of Seattle\u2019s churning, anxious arc of growth and change. The 61 women who have graduated since the school\u2019s founding in 2013 have been drawn here from across the nation and several other countries. Tuition is free for applicants who pass the rigorous admissions process, with costs underwritten by Seattle tech giants like Amazon.Of the 13 most populous counties in the nation, King County in the Seattle metro area is second only to Brooklyn in the highest percentage of residents age 25 to 34, part of the biggest demographic wave since the baby boom, according to census data. And Seattle is luring those millennials from all over, with King ranking second among big counties in the percentage of people who moved here within the past year from another state.But even in a place of alluring opportunity, the Adies, like Ms. Boshart, mirror their generation\u2019s anxieties.Hailey Willis, for example, was accepted to Ada and arrived here last year from Chicago with six months of savings to her name. In Seattle, markedly more expensive, the money was gone in 90 days. Asked about her financial future, Ms. Willis, 31, said she saw no chance that anything like Social Security would be there for her or anyone her age.Elsa Moluf, 26, an Ada graduate, said the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, still resonated when she thought about personal safety \u2014 a feeling compounded recently by a shooting on a Seattle street in broad daylight only a few feet from her. \u201cIn the era of terrorism, I think about stuff like, \u2018If I go to this crowded festival, what are the chances,\u2019 \u201d she said.Baby boomers, to whom millennials are often compared \u2014 if only by the force of their numbers \u2014 also reached adulthood amid tumult and angst, during the Vietnam War and the struggle for civil rights. But people now in their 20s and 30s say that the 1960s were different, that there seemed to be a clearer goal then \u2014 to end racial segregation, poverty or the war. The economy seemed better and the nation\u2019s future more assured.Now, from niche anxieties like genetically modified crops to defining ones like climate change, questions feel open-ended and unprecedented: Is the food we eat still food? How do you get your head around a threat to the entire planet?Contradictions and paradoxes, millennials say, come with the territory. Ms. Boshart, for example, would love to own a house someday. But at the same time, debt to her feels perilous. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be beholden to any bank, ever,\u201d she said with quiet vehemence. She counts the months until the tech job she hopes to get after Ada can help pay off the $22,000 student debt she has left.And then there are presidential politics, with one candidate, Donald J. Trump, who scares her to death and another, Hillary Clinton, whom she admires but is sometimes hesitant to praise too loudly in an area where most people she knew supported Senator Bernie Sanders.She sees politics through a feminist lens and believes that women\u2019s rights would be undermined by a Trump presidency and a Trump-selected Supreme Court. And even though recent polls and surveys show Sanders supporters largely rallying to Mrs. Clinton, it is not enough to create any sense of security, Ms. Boshart said, that an October surprise of hacked data or a hidden pool of misogyny and rage do not still lie in wait.\u201cThere are just so many things you can be anxious about \u2014 it\u2019s an anxious time,\u201d she said. \u201cMy biggest fear is that America hates women more than they hate Donald Trump.\u201dRiley Spicer, 26, said she cannot help buying food on sale and socking it away. She arrived in Seattle last year from rural Oregon to start classes at Ada, and she and her boyfriend, Jakob Lundy, 27, a fireman, have planted a garden and started a beehive to harvest honey.\u201cI had the radishes today in my salad at work,\u201d Ms. Spicer said on a recent evening, as she carefully exposed the leaves to reveal red-topped bulbs. \u201cWhen I go to the store and I get three bags of mushrooms, they\u2019re like, \u2018What are you doing?\u2019 I\u2019m stuffing mushrooms and freezing them \u2014 doesn\u2019t everyone do that?\u201dMs. Spicer, who studied philosophy and the history of science at St. John\u2019s College in Annapolis, Md., has had jobs as a barista, a taxi dispatcher and a deli worker. She has $72,000 of student debt and has never been paid an annual wage, she said, of more than $17,000. Based on the track record of Ada graduates, she could soon be making five times as much.So on one level, she and Mr. Lundy \u2014 young, in love and employed or soon to be \u2014 might look as if they are living the American dream.But neither one is buying it.\u201cI look out there and it just seems completely hopeless to me,\u201d she said as their 12-year-old mutt, Cordelia, wandered through their apartment. \u201cThe political system seems so overwhelmingly broken that I have no idea what to do about it.\u201dMr. Lundy rejects the two-party political system entirely and has voted mostly for third-party candidates, if only as a statement of opposition to the choice of a Republican or a Democrat. He is not sure what he will do this year.\u201cI don\u2019t want to support the false dichotomy,\u201d he said. He said he liked Mr. Sanders partly because a Sanders insurgency \u201cwould be best at reforming the party, or tearing it apart from the inside.\u201d He also applauded Mr. Trump\u2019s antics, which Mr. Lundy believes will shatter the Republican Party, too.Either way, he added, a shake-up is coming. \u201cThings are going to have to burn before they get better,\u201d he said.Technology is the sea that millennials swim in \u2014 a kind of second nature, especially to Adies. But many of them feel a deep ambivalence. Tech, they say, means military drones, loss of privacy and cyberbullying. Social media, the new town square, often feels more like a combat zone than a place to share ideas. Tech companies are driving up rent in places like Seattle, forcing out lower-income people, even while creating excellent jobs that Adies are likely to get.\u201cThe tech industry is a huge part of the problem,\u201d said Jessica Weeber, 31, who is studying at Ada alongside Ms. Boshart. \u201cAs people get paid more and work in tech jobs, rents and housing go up and gentrification happens,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to solve it.\u201dBut tech is also an unquestionably powerful tool.\u201cTech gives us the power to change \u2014 that\u2019s why I\u2019m here,\u201d said Mindy Carson, 31, an Ada student and strong supporter of Mr. Sanders. She wants to start a nonprofit after graduation, using technology to work on social justice issues. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to take what they\u2019re saying on TV for face value, we don\u2019t have to take limited information for face value, because we see the truth, we are connected,\u201d she added.Ms. Boshart used technology in a recent burlesque performance, including a recorded voice-over appearance by the astronomer Carl Sagan, to make a point about humanity\u2019s intertwined role with science.She walked on stage wearing a glamorous evening gown, opera gloves, and a corset underneath with 160 LED lights and a tiny computer to run them. Mr. Sagan\u2019s voice came on, talking about the cosmos. As her clothing came off, she said, \u201cI became more and more human. And that was kind of the point: We are artifice to the world, what we present, but as we get deeper and deeper into the human element we are atoms and star dust.\u201dMs. Boshart gravitated to burlesque, she said, partly to make such statements. But after her mother died last summer, things became more profound and personal. The women of the Seattle Burlesque Society showed up at the apartment she shares with her fianc\u00e9. They brought food. They cleaned. They carved out a quiet corner for grieving and meditation.They became, in their embrace, her sisters. Like many people in her generation, Ms. Boshart does not expect to find those connections in political parties. She no longer goes to church. The workplace doesn\u2019t seem to offer much hope either.\u201cMy dad was laid off after 35 years, and that was supposed to be his community, right? That was supposed to be the group of people that understood,\u201d she said before a recent Monday night performance that she was producing at a brewpub north of downtown. \u201cHe worked for years and years for you and he\u2019s just out? It was appalling to me.\u2019\u2019What should be tossed out, or clung to, is the question of the moment, she said. And for her, a big part of her answer lies in the proud and quirky universe of burlesque, her anchor of belonging in a world that can feel fragmented and frayed.As she got up from the table for a final chat with the cast, music pounded out as performers \u2014 various ages and body types in heavy eye shadow and feathered boas \u2014 got ready to go on. They hugged, and she cautioned them about a low table with sharp corners that would be hard to see in the dark. One small peril avoided, it was time for show-mode.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Is Said to Owe Back Taxes to Irish Government", "Date": "2016-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe European Union\u2019s competition authorities are poised to announce a major tax ruling against Apple\u2019s tax dealings with the Irish government on Tuesday, a decision that will likely increase trans-Atlantic tension over how some of the world\u2019s largest companies pay taxes on their global operations.The ruling, expected to be announced early Tuesday in Brussels, will result in Apple having to pay back taxes to the Irish government, according to three people briefed on the decision who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The amount is anticipated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars, one of these people said.The decision is set to further stoke tensions between American officials and their European counterparts, with Europe claiming the right to oversee tax policies for companies like Apple and Amazon, among others, that have used complicated tax structures in nations like Ireland and Luxembourg to reduce the amount of corporate tax they pay in other countries.\u201cThis will be framed by the U.S. as Europe overreaching,\u201d said Edward Kleinbard, a professor at the University of Southern California\u2019s Gould School of Law and a former chief of staff to the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. \u201cThat overreaction will make it a lot more difficult to police companies\u2019 international tax structures.\u201dApple, Irish authorities and European competition authorities declined to comment. The tax decision was earlier reported by RTE, the Irish broadcaster.Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s top antitrust official, is expected to say on Tuesday that the Irish government gave Apple preferential treatment on its local tax arrangements. These deals, related to agreements from 1991 and 2007, gave Apple an unfair advantage over other companies, and broke Europe\u2019s so-called state-aid rules that forbid any government from providing unfair assistance to certain companies over others, she is expected to say.Ireland can appeal any judgment by suing in the Court of Justice of the European Union to stop any resulting penalty, and Apple could seek to support such an appeal. Such appeals are likely to take years.For Apple, the potential tax clawback would be a blow to the company\u2019s approximately 30 years of activity in Ireland, where it currently employs around 5,500 people, mostly in Cork, a city in the south of the country.The tech giant has repeatedly denied that it received unfair tax treatment from Irish authorities, saying that it complies with all tax laws wherever it operates. While Apple has a large operation in Ireland, the company said its main corporate tax liabilities remain within the United States where it is based and conducts the majority of its research and development.The European Commission has been seeking a greater say over tax issues for decades. Those efforts accelerated after the 2008 financial crisis amid complaints that prosperous corporations were enjoying tax breaks while citizens faced mounting tax demands and cuts to their public services.Ms. Vestager has already ordered Luxembourg to claw back 30 million euros, or $33 million, from Fiat, the Italian carmaker, and the Netherlands to recover a similar amount from Starbucks. Both Luxembourg and the Netherlands have appealed those decisions. She still is investigating similar cases in Luxembourg affecting Amazon and McDonald\u2019s.Last year, in another case, Ms. Vestager ordered France to recover \u20ac1.4 billion, or $1.6 billion, from state-controlled \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France for failing to pay enough corporation tax in 1997. At the time, E.D.F. said it would make the reimbursement but was considering an appeal to the Court of Justice of the European Union.\u201cOur aim is very simple,\u201d Ms. Vestager said in an interview earlier this year. \u201cProfits should be taxed where profits are made.\u201dThe European Union\u2019s investigation into the Irish treatment of Apple began under Ms. Vestager\u2019s predecessor, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia. It was prompted in part by a United States Senate investigation in 2013 that found that Apple, the world\u2019s largest public company by market capitalization, sheltered tens of billions of dollars in profit from tax in offshore entities including in Ireland. The European Commission opened a formal investigation in June 2014 into whether the tax deals granted to Apple in Ireland amounted to illegal state support.Ireland strongly objected to the investigation. The ruling is likely to be a hard pill to swallow for the country, which has spent decades championing its low corporate tax rate and other tax breaks to entice American companies to its shores.The Irish government has said that it will appeal any tax decision announced by European officials, putting the country in the somewhat odd position of turning down potentially billions of dollars of extra revenue from Apple.\u201cThe decision by the Irish government to fight this case is bizarre,\u201d said James Stewart, a professor at Trinity College, Dublin. \u201cThe Irish government is opposed to any global tax harmonization because it will harm its ability to attract foreign direct investment.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Has Big Plans for Alexa: Running the \u2018Star Trek\u2019 Home", "Date": "2016-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Amazon surprised a lot of people when its Echo, a $180 so-called smart speaker, became a hit, giving them a novel way to play music, turn on the lights in their homes and set thermostats with voice commands.Amazon, though, has much bigger plans for the technology behind Echo. It wants the Alexa Voice Service, which powers Echo, to be an ingredient in devices around the home and beyond, even if they aren\u2019t made by Amazon.The vision of an omnipresent intelligent assistant is one Amazon shares, in one form or another, with most other big technology companies, including Apple, Google and Microsoft. Along with a handful of start-ups, these companies see their intelligent assistants as powerful new ways for users to interact with devices and internet services \u2014 just as smartphone touch screens were.Many technology specialists think that people will be O.K. with a single intelligent assistant in their lives but that most won\u2019t have the patience to regularly use two or three of them, each with its individual quirks. As a result, each company is racing to weave its assistant into as many devices and services as possible.\u201cWe\u2019re taking $180 worth of utility and adding it into a $200 device,\u201d he said.Ford Motor is working with Amazon to integrate Alexa into its vehicles so drivers can control smart-home features like lights, thermostats and security systems from their cars.Over 10,000 developers have registered to integrate Alexa into their products, Amazon said. It won\u2019t say how many Echo units it has sold, except to say that millions of devices with Alexa in them have been purchased.In an interview this spring, David Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for devices, said that the company wanted there to be as many Alexa-linked \u201cendpoints\u201d around the home as possible and that Amazon did not really care who made those devices. Amazon has expanded its lineup of devices that use Alexa with its Echo Dot, a miniature version of the Echo speaker, and Amazon Tap, a portable Bluetooth speaker.\u201cThe longer-term vision is a little bit like the \u2018Star Trek\u2019 computer,\u201d Mr. Limp said. \u201cCaptain Kirk or Picard could sit on the bridge and ask anything and get the right answer.\u201dBut while Amazon has made a lot of progress in this regard, it may have a hard time extending Alexa\u2019s reach outside the home because of its weaknesses in mobile technology, analysts say.The success of Echo has been described as a redemption of sorts for Amazon after it suffered a brutal defeat in the smartphone market with its Fire Phone, which the company stopped selling after poor sales \u2014 a misstep that has left Amazon vulnerable.Apple and Google have clear advantages over Amazon because of their dominant positions in the mobile market. And they are pushing their versions of Alexa \u2014 Siri and Google\u2019s assistant \u2014 as ways to control other devices throughout the home.As intelligent assistants improve in quality, Jan Dawson, an analyst at Jackdaw Research, thinks people will want these virtual helpers to follow them all day like a companion. \u201cWhat you want from an assistant is that they are always available to you everywhere,\u201d he said.While Amazon could eventually give people access to Alexa\u2019s functions through apps on smartphones (a couple of apps from independent developers do this already), Mr. Dawson is skeptical that Amazon will be able to make them work as well as assistants more deeply integrated into smartphones by Apple and Google.\u201cThey\u2019re basically absent on smartphones, which are devices we take everywhere we go,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Miracle Mosquito Repellent Is Hard to Come By", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "Supported byAs tens of thousands of people arrive in Rio de Janeiro for the Summer Olympics this week, millions of mosquitoes, some perhaps carrying the Zika virus, await them.But what may be the best repellent around is also the hardest to get.It comes in a greenish-gray tube. It is a sticky gel, but it has a mild, pleasant odor, which is kind of floral. It is simply called Repelente Gel, and it is produced by and for the Brazilian Army.A military lab makes it, so good luck getting your hands on it.The occasional civilian who has managed to find it has often ended up swearing by it. I know. I am one of them. I encountered this repellent in Haiti while on assignment for The New York Times in 2010, covering the cholera epidemic and a presidential election.Brazilian soldiers were a large part of the United Nations peacekeeping force helping to police Haiti. One afternoon, I rode along with them on a patrol. As I got on a truck, a smiling soldier handed me a tube of his repellent and in English said, \u201cFor you, for the mosquitoes.\u201dI was intrigued at what a soldier from an Amazonian country would use. The stuff I had always picked up at the drugstore had never seemed to be quite enough.So I slathered it on. No allergic reaction, good. Better yet, even hours later, no mosquitoes \u2014 at least noticeably fewer. No buzzing in my ears. No patchwork of bites.I strained to conserve this miracle gel for the remaining days of that trip and subsequent ones, despairing when it ran out. (Hey, guys, how about another ride-along?)I was not alone. Simon Romero, my colleague in The Times\u2019s Rio de Janeiro bureau, swears by the stuff, too, having used it on trips with the military into the Amazon jungle.So what\u2019s the secret? And more important, where can you get it?Well, the Brazilian Army prefers to keep its product for soldiers and is circumspect about saying exactly what makes it so effective.It is found in mosquito repellents available the world over, but the army\u2019s public relations office did not answer questions about how much DEET was in it (other than to say the amount was \u201csimilar\u201d to that found in commercially available products) or whether it contained other antimosquito ingredients. (It did say the repellent worked on \u201ca broad spectrum of insects.\u201d)The peerless swimmer Katie Ledecky; a photo essay of Olympians and their heroes; the sprinter Justin Gatlin\u2019s comeback; how Boston\u2019s citizens fought to reject their city\u2019s bid; and 10 writers on their memories of Games past.The office said the repellent had been developed over the course of 20 years and \u201cwas tested in the laboratory and the field by the land forces across the whole country.\u201dThe office added, \u201cIt showed excellent results in areas of major insect pest infestation, such as Amazon, Pantanal, Angola and Haiti.\u201dThere is no \u201cplan for external commercialization,\u201d the statement said.Word is getting around, though, about how good it is.The Brazilian Health Ministry wanted the gel, too. In December, the ministry asked the army for it, to give to pregnant women as part of anti-Zika measures, but negotiations apparently stalled. The army had expressed concern, according to news reports, that its lab could not produce the repellent on the scale that the health ministry wanted.\u201cThe army and all the country\u2019s laboratories which we have consulted are not prepared to produce the volume of repellent we need immediately,\u201d the health minister, Marcelo Castro, said in January.There is some hope for Olympic visitors.To protect the Games, Brazilian officials have said, they have deployed more than 85,000 soldiers and police officers to Rio de Janeiro.

So he has extended the deadline to Sept. 20 from Aug. 11.When asked if he had a Plan C if he had still not received enough entries in a month, he offered a blunt analogy: He could extend the deadline again, he said, but that would be \u201clike pounding your thumb with a hammer \u2014 it\u2019s not going to stop hurting.\u201dThat could sum up the newspaper business these days, at least for many big dailies, which have been upended by the internet and are in a frantic race to reinvent themselves to stay relevant in today\u2019s crowded and fragmented news media environment. The New England landscape is dotted with papers of significant lineage, many of them going through upheavals in ownership as they struggle to survive.But, Mr. Benton cautioned, the ad base can dry up, especially in the era of Amazon and big-box stores.The Gazette has been operating for 127 years, growing along with the town\u2019s granite industry. Work at the quarries peaked in 1910, as did Hardwick\u2019s population, hitting 3,200. The town then retrenched as it returned to its agricultural roots.Mr. Connelly, a trim man with close-cropped white hair and a steady gaze, who has carved out a small sitting space in front of piles of paper on his overstuffed wooden desk, has been the Gazette\u2019s steward for three decades. He is determined to find someone to whom to pass the torch.But when the contest closed Aug. 11, he had not received the 700 essays that he said was the minimum needed to make the contest financially viable. He would not say how many he had received, nor would he share the contents of the entries, saying he did not want to skew the judging.He did say that the paper, which has a paid circulation of 2,200, grossed $240,000 last year. He had figured that, with a contest entry fee of $175, 700 essays would yield enough, $122,500, to cover the Gazette building, computers and taxes and send him on his glide to retirement.He has a few guesses about why not enough entries materialized.\u201cMaybe the people who have experience know that you\u2019re not going to get rich and you\u2019re going to work your butt off,\u201d he said. \u201cThe hours are long and the pay is not great, and so they were smart enough to say, \u2018I don\u2019t want any part of this.\u2019\u201d\u201cAnd,\u201d he added, \u201cthere\u2019s a generation and a half now of people who don\u2019t even know what a newspaper is.\u201dWhat it is not, he said, is social media. \u201cFor someone to hold up a Facebook post as journalism is kind of an affront,\u201d he said.Journalism at The Gazette consists of keeping track of local government and the goings on here and in a few surrounding towns: With milk prices falling, for example, dairy farmers are banding together to increase their clout. The nearby town of Craftsbury, a Gazette reporter wrote, is \u201cjoining the 21st century\u201d with high-speed internet.Mr. Connelly says that he has also covered topics that some readers objected to, including a big bank scandal involving a local resident and the harassment of a transgender police officer by a town official.The paper, running 10 or 12 pages, is filled with the staples of community weeklies: local sports, calendars, birth announcements and obituaries, the police blotter and reviews of artistic endeavors. In last week\u2019s edition, one correspondent, Michael Bielawski, wrote five of the seven front-page stories.\u201cYou have to keep going back and become a familiar face to them, and then they begin to understand that we\u2019re a local business just like they are,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you have to spend four hours to get two ads, that\u2019s what you do.\u201dMr. Connelly takes a dim view of the headphone-wearing, phone-obsessed, plugged-in culture. So it is little surprise that The Gazette has avoided being available online.\u201cI don\u2019t believe in giving away my product,\u201d Mr. Connelly said. \u201cThat was one of the big mistakes newspapers made, because now you have people thinking it\u2019s free.\u201dIn his view, the hard copy of the paper fosters civic engagement in a way that a smartphone does not.\u201cWhen you pick up your paper, you may see a headline or a photograph that will grab your attention, and you\u2019ll say to the cashier or the person next to you, \u2018Did you see that?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt brings people together. It is a building block of democracy.\u201dNor is he impressed with social media; the anonymity of it, he said, can breed anarchy. By contrast, he prints letters to the editor only if they include the writer\u2019s signature, name, address and phone number.Mr. Connelly and his wife initially lived on the second floor of the Gazette building. Their son, Sawyer, 25, who works for a wildlife conservation group in Montana, wrote on the contest website his reminiscence of growing up at the paper.On production nights, he said, he would curl up under his mother\u2019s desk with the family dog \u201cand fall asleep amidst the sounds of keystrokes and the smell of coffee and ink.\u201dHe said that he and his father were unprepared to deal with his mother\u2019s death. The Gazette, he said, \u201cwas very much the two of them.\u201dNow, he said, \u201cand I\u2019m sure my mother would agree, it\u2019s time for my father to begin his next adventure.\u201dAdvertisement"}

You know what they say in baseball \u2014 if you get a hit one out of every three at-bats, you\u2019re in the Hall of Fame.The TV series, which at least at the start is set in Marfa, the arts-and-academic community in Texas, certainly has casting going for it. Kevin Bacon is Dick, and Griffin Dunne is Chris\u2019s husband, Sylv\u00e8re. The series, though, rises or falls on the shoulders of the Chris character, and Kathryn Hahn, one of the most reliable actresses around, looks in the pilot as if she could end up with some statuettes for her portrayal.The pilot doesn\u2019t progress far into the story \u2014 Chris has barely had time to meet Dick and share one dismissive dinner with him and her husband \u2014 but it\u2019s clear that Ms. Hahn\u2019s character is eager to go exploring and that Ms. Soloway intends to make a challenging, simmering, provocative sort of comedy.Another cult following also gets a pilot to chew on: \u201cThe Tick,\u201d the latest try at making a TV series out of the comic book character that Ben Edlund created in the 1980s. The title character (played here by Peter Serafinowicz) is a parody of a superhero, wearing a blue tick costume and speaking in overblown phrases that sometimes sort of make sense.And then there\u2019s \u201cJean-Claude Van Johnson,\u201d in which Jean-Claude Van Damme tries to parody his own action-movie persona. He plays himself, but it turns out he has an undercover identity as Jean-Claude Van Johnson, a vaguely defined contractor who does black-ops work.But \u2014 pay attention because this gets confusing \u2014 to go undercover as Van Johnson, Van Johnson has to assume the identity of Jean-Claude Van Damme, because a movie shoot is what gets him into Bulgaria, where Van Johnson needs to be. If that seems like a convoluted way to get to a simple gag, it is, and though the pilot does pay off in a pretty funny fight sequence, it\u2019s not at all clear by its end where this series intends to go with what seems like a one-joke premise.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Miracle Mosquito Repellent Is Hard to Come By", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs tens of thousands of people arrive in Rio de Janeiro for the Summer Olympics this week, millions of mosquitoes, some perhaps carrying the Zika virus, await them.But what may be the best repellent around is also the hardest to get.It comes in a greenish-gray tube. It is a sticky gel, but it has a mild, pleasant odor, which is kind of floral. It is simply called Repelente Gel, and it is produced by and for the Brazilian Army.A military lab makes it, so good luck getting your hands on it.The occasional civilian who has managed to find it has often ended up swearing by it. I know. I am one of them. I encountered this repellent in Haiti while on assignment for The New York Times in 2010, covering the cholera epidemic and a presidential election.Brazilian soldiers were a large part of the United Nations peacekeeping force helping to police Haiti. One afternoon, I rode along with them on a patrol. As I got on a truck, a smiling soldier handed me a tube of his repellent and in English said, \u201cFor you, for the mosquitoes.\u201dI was intrigued at what a soldier from an Amazonian country would use. The stuff I had always picked up at the drugstore had never seemed to be quite enough.So I slathered it on. No allergic reaction, good. Better yet, even hours later, no mosquitoes \u2014 at least noticeably fewer. No buzzing in my ears. No patchwork of bites.I strained to conserve this miracle gel for the remaining days of that trip and subsequent ones, despairing when it ran out. (Hey, guys, how about another ride-along?)I was not alone. Simon Romero, my colleague in The Times\u2019s Rio de Janeiro bureau, swears by the stuff, too, having used it on trips with the military into the Amazon jungle.So what\u2019s the secret? And more important, where can you get it?Well, the Brazilian Army prefers to keep its product for soldiers and is circumspect about saying exactly what makes it so effective.It is found in mosquito repellents available the world over, but the army\u2019s public relations office did not answer questions about how much DEET was in it (other than to say the amount was \u201csimilar\u201d to that found in commercially available products) or whether it contained other antimosquito ingredients. (It did say the repellent worked on \u201ca broad spectrum of insects.\u201d)The peerless swimmer Katie Ledecky; a photo essay of Olympians and their heroes; the sprinter Justin Gatlin\u2019s comeback; how Boston\u2019s citizens fought to reject their city\u2019s bid; and 10 writers on their memories of Games past.The office said the repellent had been developed over the course of 20 years and \u201cwas tested in the laboratory and the field by the land forces across the whole country.\u201dThe office added, \u201cIt showed excellent results in areas of major insect pest infestation, such as Amazon, Pantanal, Angola and Haiti.\u201dThere is no \u201cplan for external commercialization,\u201d the statement said.Word is getting around, though, about how good it is.The Brazilian Health Ministry wanted the gel, too. In December, the ministry asked the army for it, to give to pregnant women as part of anti-Zika measures, but negotiations apparently stalled. The army had expressed concern, according to news reports, that its lab could not produce the repellent on the scale that the health ministry wanted.\u201cThe army and all the country\u2019s laboratories which we have consulted are not prepared to produce the volume of repellent we need immediately,\u201d the health minister, Marcelo Castro, said in January.There is some hope for Olympic visitors.To protect the Games, Brazilian officials have said, they have deployed more than 85,000 soldiers and police officers to Rio de Janeiro. You never know what a friendly soldier might share.Tania Franco contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Power of Memories: \u2018Muriel\u2019 and \u2018Cemetery of Splendor\u2019", "Date": "2016-08-25", "News": "Supported byOn DVDTime and memory were consistent concerns for the French director Alain Resnais, who died in 2014 at 91. Historical trauma was a preoccupation as well, at least during the first stage of Mr. Resnais\u2019s long career.For these reasons, among others, \u201cMuriel, or The Time of Return\u201d (1963) can be considered his quintessential film. As revisited in Criterion\u2019s excellent new Blu-ray transfer, made from a 2015 digital restoration, it also appears to be his greatest.As compared with \u201cMarienbad,\u201d \u201cMuriel\u201d tells a relatively straightforward story. (The script was by Jean Cayrol, the concentration camp survivor who wrote the narration for Mr. Resnais\u2019s classic documentary \u201cNight and Fog.\u201d) It\u2019s the way in which the plot unfolds that is radically unconventional. The action is chronological but fragmentary, filled with parallels and mysteries.\u201cMuriel\u201d is set in Boulogne-sur-Mer, a town on the French side of the English Channel largely destroyed by Allied bombs during World War II and subsequently rebuilt. The protagonist, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne (Delphine Seyrig), is a widowed antique dealer and unlucky gambler whose world is further rocked when her prewar lover, Alphonse (Jean-Pierre K\u00e9rien), returns to court her, despite having a young mistress in tow.Meanwhile, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s stepson, Bernard (Jean-Baptiste Thi\u00e9rr\u00e9e), is coping with the aftermath of the recent colonial war in Algeria, where he served as a soldier. High-strung and reclusive, he speaks of a nonexistent girlfriend, Muriel, who manifests the guilty memory of a wartime atrocity in which he participated.H\u00e9l\u00e8ne lives in a reconstructed town, surrounded by old objects she sells for a living. Alphonse keeps bringing up, and most likely fictionalizing, their distant personal history, while Bernard alternately denies and attempts to document his. \u201cI\u2019m collecting evidence,\u201d he explains more than once. \u201cMuriel\u201d is all about all the ways that the past makes itself present.\u201cMuriel\u201d is also about representing life as a movie. The aggressively atonal soundtrack by the German composer Hans Werner Henze calls attention to the film as a construct. So do Mr. Resnais\u2019s percussive camera moves and dense editing.The screenplay supplies the exits and entrances of a stage play. But the largely associative montage is highly cinematic and overtly modernist, based less on the characters\u2019 histrionics than a sense of clashing vectors and visual force fields. At times, Mr. Resnais intercuts multiple conversations or matches the sound of one interaction to the image of another so that the movie seems to be talking to itself.Around the time that one character angrily asks, \u201cCan\u2019t we be done with the past?,\u201d Mr. Resnais decides the clear the stage. The movie becomes almost antic and then powerfully abrupt as the principals begin to disappear.In essence, \u201cMuriel\u201d is a series of ruptures \u2014 both for Mr. Resnais\u2019s characters and within his film \u2014 that serve to dramatize the way in which war and colonialism can disrupt individual lives as well as conventional narratives.His distinctive, highly personal movies, which can appear deliberately na\u00efve and are characterized by what seems to be a Buddhist-inflected animism, can be even more mysterious than those of Mr. Resnais\u2019s.\u201cCemetery of Splendor\u201d (out on Blu-ray and DVD from Strand Releasing) may be Mr. Weerasethakul\u2019s most political movie, set in a bucolic hospital for narcoleptic soldiers in Khon Kaen, the filmmaker\u2019s hometown, in northeast Thailand. A former school, the hospital was built atop an ancient ruin and perhaps serves as cover for a secret government project.The three main characters are the young soldier Itt; a middle-aged hospital volunteer, Jen (Jenjira Pongpas Widner, a frequent presence in Mr. Weerasethakul\u2019s movies), who sits with Itt while he sleeps and keeps him company during his brief, unpredictable periods of wakefulness; and a younger woman, Keng, the hospital\u2019s resident medium, who can \u201csee\u201d the sleeping soldiers\u2019 dreams.Frequent close-ups of spinning ceiling fans promote a hypnotic mood. At one point, an overhead shot of a movie theater\u2019s overlapping escalators provides a pattern that suggests a \u201cfound\u201d mandala. Intimations of perpetual civil war notwithstanding, Mr. Weerasethakul\u2019s criticism is oblique, as befits a movie made under martial law. Beside each sleeping soldier is an upright neon tube reminiscent of a Dan Flavin sculpture, described as a machine initially developed to promote \u201cgood dreams\u201d for American soldiers in Afghanistan.Given the many local references, the \u201cSplendor\u201d disc could have benefited from notes, like the fine essay by James Quandt accompanying \u201cMuriel.\u201d It does, however, include as an extra Mr. Weerasethakul\u2019s short feature \u201cMekong Hotel,\u201d a gentle ghost story \u2014 possibly the ghost of an unfinished project \u2014 made in 2012.NEWLY RELEASEDAdvertisement"}

She wanted character, not shiny out of the box. Some of the cymbals she got were grimy with age and water spots that hinted of concerts in the rain. Others were chipped, dinged and dented.\u201cYou walk through space and you have cause and effect,\u201d she said.But like Mr. Allen himself, who has fingerprints on much of the city\u2019s explosion of growth, geekiness only touches the surface.Now his passion for art, as a collector and benefactor, is resonating too. The fair, which featured 84 galleries from locations as varied as New York, Los Angeles, Seoul and Miami \u2014 up from 60 in its first year \u2014 drew more than 15,000 visitors last year, and had about 18,000 by the fair\u2019s close on Sunday.What the fair says about Seattle, and whether its art community was sufficiently represented, with 18 Pacific Northwest galleries on the roster \u2014 and only 10 from Seattle \u2014 remains a continuing debate.\u201cIf there\u2019s going to be all this energy, and all these collectors coming in from out of town, and critics and press talking about it, we can either, as an art community, sit on the sideline and watch the spectacle, or we can participate and ride that wave. I\u2019m not one to sit out a big opportunity,\u201d said Greg Lundgren, Out of Sight\u2019s founder.\u201cPeople are really trying to rise to the occasion,\u201d said Kirsten Anderson, Roq La Rue\u2019s owner and founder. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard as much complaining this year,\u201d she added.Carl and Jeannette Pergam, both retired physicians who were visiting the fair from a Seattle suburb, said they were struck by the high prices, which they said spoke to them partly about the art\u2019s quality, but also about the wave of wealth in Seattle from the explosion of growth at technology companies like Amazon and Microsoft.\u201cThe ones I would put up on my wall are sparse,\u201d said Ms. Vartanian, 47, a cancer researcher who lives in Seattle. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of important work here.\u201dMr. Allen said in an interview that he pushed no particular vision of what the fair should be about, but that he likes the interplay of intellect and emotion.\u201cThere\u2019s always this interesting tension between fairly intellectual pursuits like science, and more visceral pursuits like art, and how they respond and bond to each other,\u201d he said. He also deeply appreciates, he added, the simple joy of the unexpected.Laura Fried, the Seattle Art Fair\u2019s artistic director, said that she gravitated to what the artists were trying to say about the connection between technology and modern life.\u201cThe conceptual underpinnings are more what I find interesting,\u201d she said.\u201cThe way that we are arranging our world is changing, with digital space merging with physical space,\u201d she said. \u201cI really love thinking about softness in public.\u201dMs. Kasper said she thought about the human stories behind the objects in assembling her cymbals project.

Please.As one walks down the sidewalks in residential areas, shaded by mature trees and basking in the city\u2019s sunny, mild weather, it\u2019s not too hard to understand why homeowners are trying to keep Palo Alto small despite its reputation for giving birth to the world\u2019s next big thing.But as symbols go, it\u2019s hard to beat the paradox of bad cellphone reception in the cradle of cutting-edge technology.Brian Reid, a computer scientist and Palo Alto resident, blames \u201can unbelievable, fanatical fear of cell towers\u201d among Palo Alto residents for the somewhat spotty coverage, and he said heavy data usage compounded the problem.Mr. Reid, who lives four doors from the house of Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple who died in 2011, remembers the irony in 2007, a time of even worse cellphone coverage, when the iPhone was being introduced.

{"Headline": "U.S. Women\u2019s Soccer Team Has Changed, but Hunt for Gold Has Not", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "Supported byAnalysisRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Scroll back to 2011 for a minute. In the quarterfinals of the Women\u2019s World Cup, with the United States down a goal and a player in the final seconds of overtime, Megan Rapinoe curled a 45-yard crossing pass onto the forehead of Abby Wambach, who smashed it into the net for a 2-2 tie in a game that the Americans won on penalty kicks.The degree of difficulty alone made it one of the great goals in United States soccer history \u2014 think of sinking a 50-foot putt on the 18th green to win the United States Open \u2014 and it propelled Rapinoe and Wambach, and their teammates, to the final, where they had a 2-1 lead late in overtime against Japan but could not protect it as Japan won on penalty kicks.Check out 2012 for a second. At the Summer Olympics in London, the same group of American women fought off a huge upset bid by Canada in the semifinals, finally prevailing, 4-3, when Alex Morgan headed in the winning goal, again in the final seconds of overtime. This time the United States held onto a 2-1 lead against Japan in the finals, only because Hope Solo made a great body-extension save in the final minutes of regulation to prevent a tying goal.Finally, there is 2015, and the Women\u2019s World Cup in Canada. In a semifinal game against Germany, with the score 0-0 in the second half, Solo psyched out Celia Susic on a penalty kick to keep the game scoreless and the United States from falling into a dangerous hole. The Americans took over the game and won, 2-0. In the final, again against Japan, Carli Lloyd led an early onslaught \u2014 four goals in the first 16 minutes \u2014 that gave the United States a 5-2 victory, a World Cup title and a ticker-tape parade in Manhattan that affirmed the team\u2019s soaring status and appeal.Now the American women, with some inevitable additions to and subtractions from the roster and a continuing wage dispute with the national soccer federation, are back at it again. In one of the initial events of the Rio Olympics, the Americans will face New Zealand in a first-round game in Belo Horizonte on Wednesday night, 48 hours before the opening ceremony.There are 12 women\u2019s teams in the Olympic competition, and two-thirds of them will advance to the quarterfinals, in contrast to the format of last year\u2019s World Cup, which had 24 teams and an elimination round that began with 16 teams, rather than eight.Still, the Olympics count for a lot. If the United States wins this tournament, it will represent the first time in women\u2019s soccer that the same country has won the World Cup and the Olympics in consecutive years. It will also give the American women four straight Olympic gold medals.Most significant, perhaps, it will add to the notion that the women are America\u2019s most compelling national team. The roster includes several familiar faces \u2014 Rapinoe, Morgan, Lloyd, Solo, Julie Johnston, Becky Sauerbrunn, Meghan Klingenberg, Morgan Brien, Tobin Heath, Kelley O\u2019Hara and Ali Krieger \u2014 and some significant new ones.Most notable in that group are Crystal Dunn, 24, who nearly made the World Cup roster last year and has now emerged as a dynamic scorer, and the U.C.L.A.-bound Mallory Pugh, who at 18 is the youngest player on the team and is, like Dunn, an offensive threat.Gone from the team, and into retirement, are some stalwarts: Wambach, Christie Rampone, Shannon Boxx and Lauren Holiday.And on the bubble, perhaps, is Rapinoe, 32, who is still probably the most creative and colorful player on the team \u2014 provided she is healthy. She injured her right knee in December, having twice hurt her left knee in college, and did not take part in any of the tuneup games leading to the Olympics.Whether she can participate in group play remains to be seen. In addition to New Zealand, the United States is in a group with France, a tough team that the Americans were able to avoid in last year\u2019s World Cup, and Colombia, which the Americans did meet in the World Cup and beat, 2-0.But at some point, Rapinoe is likely to be called on \u2014 just not in a final against Japan. Somehow, that nation failed to qualify for the tournament despite its sustained run of success in recent years.The American women, in contrast, always show up. Their group schedule includes a game in Manaus, in the Amazon, on Aug. 9. And their track record suggests a date in the final in Rio on Aug. 19, opponent to be named.Advertisement"}

Legg Mason, which is based in Baltimore, said Thursday that Mr. Miller had agreed to purchase the entirety of the firm\u2019s interests in LMM, giving him full ownership of the entity.In the 1990s and the early part of the 2000s, Mr. Miller was the Joe DiMaggio of mutual fund investors, achieving fame for beating the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index for 15 consecutive years, from 1991 to 2005.But with the advent of exchange-traded funds and the investing public\u2019s embrace of passive, low-cost investing as opposed to active stock picking, Mr. Miller\u2019s style has fallen out of favor.A deep-value investor who made big, concentrated bets on a select number of companies and then stuck with them through their worst days, Mr. Miller embodied the active style of mutual fund investing that prevailed in the earlier era.And even though stocks of technology companies are not typically what value investors buy, he was an early booster of AOL and Dell and was among the first mutual fund managers that bet big on Amazon.In its heyday, Legg Mason Value Trust was one of the biggest, most popular mutual funds around, and Mr. Miller regularly graced the covers of the many personal finance magazines that flourished during this period.But Mr. Miller\u2019s stubborn style of investing hurt him during the 2008 financial crisis, when he accumulated big positions in Bear Stearns, Freddie Mac, the American International Group and other struggling financial stocks.Although he recovered from these depths, the assets he managed at Legg Mason were of a considerably smaller size.In recent years, Legg Mason has branched out aggressively into E.T.F.\u2019s, investment vehicles that track an index or mimic a style of investing and that have attracted billions of dollars in investor money \u2014 much of which has come from underperforming, actively managed mutual funds.\u201cBill has been an important part of the growth and success of Legg Mason over the years and we appreciate his many contributions,\u201d Joseph A. Sullivan, Legg Mason\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement on Thursday.Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. \u201cI am excited about the future of LMM, and our team is dedicated to our long-term, value-driven approach and to true active management. I am thankful to Legg Mason for our 35-year relationship and to the many great people I\u2019ve worked with along the way,\u201d Mr. Miller said in a statement.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Even Uber Couldn\u2019t Bridge the China Divide", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtTravis Kalanick, the co-founder and chief executive of the ride-hailing giant Uber, often defended his eagerness to risk billions on winning the Chinese market with a simple question: If you have a chance to become Amazon and Alibaba at the same time, why not try?The implication was simple. Over the last couple of decades, Amazon, Facebook, Google and other American technology giants have each followed a similar script for world domination. Like an imperial armada rolling out from North America\u2019s West Coast, these companies would try to establish beachheads on every other continent.But when American giants tried to enter the waters of China, the world\u2019s largest internet market, the armada invariably ran aground.Plagued by opaque and ever-shifting regulations and a culturally abstruse way of doing business, American companies fell to a series of local giants. Instead of Google, Baidu. Instead of Facebook, WeChat, owned by the giant Tencent. And instead of Amazon, Alibaba.That has left us with a divide: Today, there is the Chinese internet, and there is the internet of the rest of the world. A network seen in its early days as a tool to foster financial and political unity across a fragmented planet has irrevocably cleaved into two completely separate spheres.Entrepreneurs across the globe can choose to win in China or the rest of the world. You can be Alibaba or you can be Amazon. You can be Uber or you can be Didi. But you can\u2019t be both. Given the rising Chinese market and increasing tension over the role of American tech firms in the rest of the globe, the gulf between the two sides promises to become one of the most important factors in determining the shape of global tech innovation.How exactly might the war play out? In some ways, being at the mercy of two poles of internet leadership could be good for citizens of planet Earth. In emerging markets like India, the Middle East and parts of Africa and South America, the giants of China and the United States are increasingly investing billions to compete for local customers in e-commerce, social networking, ride sharing and other markets.\u201cAmazon is increasingly making its own branded products, taking on Procter & Gamble and others, and also getting into the logistics business, and shipping, and everything else,\u201d Mr. Clark said. \u201cBut Alibaba is a marketplace that doesn\u2019t hold inventory and describes themselves as helping local merchants \u2014 so maybe there\u2019s some argument that Alibaba could serve as a counter globally to Amazon.\u201d\u201cIn that way it could be like the Yalta Conference,\u201d said Mr. Clark, referring to the 1945 meeting in which the victors of World War II determined the postwar geopolitical order.\u201cThe barrels that will be thrown at you when you\u2019re trying to do business in China will just never stop,\u201d said Mark Natkin, the managing director of Marbridge Consulting, an advisory firm based in Beijing. \u201cYou\u2019ll constantly be above one barrel or recovering from jumping one, and as you\u2019re dusting yourself off you look down the road and here comes the next one.\u201dCompared with previous failures, Uber seemed to do everything right in China. It set up a separate company, Uber China, which had a buy-in from local investors, including from a local giant, Baidu. It hired many local experts, and worked closely with the national government to foster friendly relations.Insiders say Mr. Kalanick was also personally invested in the deal. He visited China eight times in the last year and a half, and became something of a tech star in the Chinese media.Publicly Mr. Kalanick had insisted he was fighting for total victory in China. But he must have known that Uber would always struggle to achieve dominance, given the emerging centrality of ride-sharing to the future of infrastructure in China. Still, even if he failed to win everything in China, investing early in the country seemed too big to skip.For now, it\u2019s especially delicious frosting. The $2 billion Uber spent tackling China is now worth about $7 billion in the new merged entity; if Didi does become one of China\u2019s largest tech companies, the value of Uber\u2019s stake in China could rise geometrically, making the firm much more attractive in a potential initial public offering. Pulling out of China also frees up Uber to invest more in other markets \u2014 India and Indonesia are big targets \u2014 as well as expand its expertise in core technological initiatives like mapping data and self-driving cars.But if spending big to tackle China ultimately works out for Uber, it will be an anomaly, and certainly not a model for other American tech giants.\u201cThe ride-sharing market is one the few markets where the upside is big enough to justify going in,\u201d Mr. Thompson said. \u201cFor most other companies, going into China is still going to be nothing but pain.\u201dEmail: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Becomes a Green Energy Supplier, With Itself as Customer", "Date": "2016-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 The words are stenciled on the front of the Apple Store, a glass box sandwiched between a nondescript Thai restaurant and a CVS pharmacy in downtown Palo Alto: \u201cThis store runs on 100 percent renewable energy.\u201dIf Apple\u2019s plans play out, it will be able to make that claim not only for its operations throughout California but also beyond, as the company aims to meet its growing needs for electricity with green sources like solar, wind and hydroelectric power.Like other big companies before it, including Walmart and Google, Apple recently received a federal designation for its energy subsidiary that allows it to become a wholesale seller of electricity from coast to coast. In effect, Apple is creating its own green utility company, although the main customer is itself.The motives may be economic as much as they are environmental. As a wholesaler, Apple could reduce the cost of its electricity load, which reached 831 million kilowatt-hours in the last fiscal year \u2014 enough to power about 76,000 homes for a year. But like a growing number of corporations, Apple is intent on reducing carbon dioxide emissions from electricity production \u2014 one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.In one ambitious venture, Apple has contracted with First Solar to begin buying a little less than half of the power later this year from California Flats, a solar energy farm now under construction. Under the terms of the deal, Apple will pay $848 million for the electricity over 25 years and receive the farm\u2019s total output by the end of the agreement. It is one of largest commercial clean energy contracts yet.Lisa Jackson, the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency who is now the Apple executive overseeing environmental policy, social initiatives and worldwide government affairs, said she hoped Apple could serve as a model for the many other big corporate power users that are now embracing clean energy.\u201cThis is just another sort of innovative way to get that power onto the grid so we don\u2019t have to take the California grid-mix default, which still includes fossil fuel,\u201d Ms. Jackson said.Although much of Apple\u2019s manufacturing is done offshore, it still has extensive needs for electric power in the United States \u2014 and not only for the sprawling new corporate campus it is building at its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., and its 270 retail stores around the country.One of Apple\u2019s biggest demands for electricity comes from operating the computing cloud through which it sells apps, music and videos to users of its iPhones, iPads and Mac computers.Apple\u2019s move comes as prices for renewable energy continue to plummet. And signing long-term contracts allows businesses to shield themselves from potentially higher, more volatile charges from a power company. Apple would not say how much it was paying for California Flats\u2019s energy, but Ms. Jackson said last year at a Wall Street Journal conference that it was less than what it paid for commercial power. She said she expected the company to save hundreds of millions of dollars over the life of the contract.Google, which received its federal energy wholesale designation from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 2010, is a big proponent of the approach Apple is now taking.\u201cRunning any kind of business, having predictability in terms of your operating costs can be very important,\u201d said Gary Demasi, director of operations for data center energy and location strategy at Google, which has been a leading investor in and user of clean energy. \u201cRenewable energy, from a cost perspective, is now competitive with other forms of energy, much more so than it was a few years ago.\u201dExecutives face greater pressure from shareholders and customers to show that they are doing their part to fight climate change. At the same time, corporate energy use has exploded, driven in many cases by the ravenous demands of the data cloud.\u201cWe are all becoming very large energy players, and this is a shift,\u201d said Brian Janous, director of energy strategy at Microsoft. \u201cEnergy is not something that Microsoft or Amazon or Google really ever had to think much about prior to the advent of the cloud.\u201dElectric utilities have begun to respond by creating products and services to meet the corporate demand for clean energy, said Letha Tawney, the World Resources Institute\u2019s director of utility innovation.One such product is a green tariff. It was pioneered in North Carolina by Duke Energy and is now under consideration in about a dozen states. It allows companies to designate that they are paying for a renewable energy supply.Another is a synthetic or virtual power purchase agreement, under which companies contract to buy the output of a clean power plant, as Apple is doing with California Flats.Although the companies say these arrangements mean they are running their businesses on renewable energy, in reality the clean power often does not flow directly to their facilities. They typically buy the renewable energy in amounts to match what they draw from the grid \u2014 a system of swaps that Ms. Jackson of Apple likened to using an A.T.M.\u201cThe dollar you deposit in the bank might not be the exact same bill that you get out,\u201d she said.Robert F. Shapiro, a partner at the law firm Chadbourne & Parke who focuses on project finance and energy, describes it as meaningful symbolism.\u201cThey\u2019re actually getting power from their local utility, which may be coal,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cBut they\u2019re deemed to have put into the world carbon-neutral energy, which they are deemed to have used for their load.\u201dTo keep track of the clean energy credits, power generators work with registries to issue numbered certificates.\u201cThe power flows into the grid. The electrons go where they go,\u201d Ms. Tawney said. \u201cBut because there\u2019s a renewable-energy certificate, no one else can claim the same zero-carbon benefit.\u201dSuch complexities are necessary, executives and clean energy advocates say, because it is not often feasible to install enough renewable-power generators at corporate sites to meet companies\u2019 full energy needs.Walmart, despite having installed solar panels, wind turbines and fuel cells at stores and distribution centers, can nonetheless meet only about a third of those operations\u2019 energy needs. So it also buys renewable energy from generators and utilities, said David Ozment, director of energy at Walmart stores.Procter & Gamble, another member of the energy buyers\u2019 alliance, has arranged to purchase all of the steam from a biomass generator under construction at a plant in Georgia where it makes Charmin toilet paper and Bounty paper towels, said Jack McAneny, the company\u2019s director of sustainability.But that was possible, he said, only because of the plant\u2019s location near a source of waste wood and pulp for fuel and the cooperation of P&G\u2019s partners. Among those partners are the local utility, Georgia Power, which will buy the electricity from the generator for its customers from Constellation, the company that developed and will own and operate the generator.At Apple, where the purchase or production of renewable energy has more than tripled since 2012, the company would prefer to not have to go to great lengths to ensure a clean energy supply, Ms. Jackson said. But the public energy grid is simply still too dependent on carbon-based fuels to make that possible.\u201cIf we had our preference, we\u2019d just be able to say, \u2018We want 100 percent green power everywhere we use power,\u2019\u201d Ms. Jackson said. \u201cThe best would be if we could run every one of our stores, every one of our data centers, every office complex, every building we have, on 100 percent renewable \u2014 and if we didn\u2019t have to spend a whole bunch of our time and energy figuring out how to get that done.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Since then, he\u2019s been bouncing among friends\u2019 apartments and Airbnb rentals.Mr. Altucher is simply practicing what he preaches. Over the last half-decade, this former tech entrepreneur, venture capitalist and financial pundit has reinvented himself as a gimlet-eyed self-help guru, preaching survival in an era when the American Dream \u2014 the gold-embossed college diploma, the corner office, the three-bedroom home \u2014 seems like a sham.

It\u2019s a fierce worldview that is rooted in Mr. Altucher\u2019s own roller-coaster life.In the 1990s, as a young Silicon Alley start-up whiz, Mr. Altucher made millions with a web-design company, Reset Inc., that counted Sony and Miramax as clients.Soon, he and his wife at the time, Anne (they divorced in 2010), were living in a 5,000-square-foot loft in TriBeCa that he bought for $1.8 million and spent another $1 million renovating. He felt flush enough to take a helicopter to Atlantic City on weekends to play poker.The lavish lifestyle did not fill his emotional void. \u201cNobody should feel sorry for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI was really stupid, but I thought I was dirt poor. I felt like I needed $100 million to be happy. So I just started investing in all these other companies, and they were just stupid companies. Zero of these investments worked out.\u201dAs his fortunes collapsed, he was forced to sell his apartment for a $1 million loss (it was after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001).\u201cFinancial people were like watching a train wreck in real time,\u201d Mr. Altucher said. \u201cI had friends I hadn\u2019t talked to since high school call me and say, \u2018Hey, are you O.K.?\u2019\u201dHe soon discovered a sizable audience of people whose own dreams had just gone down the sinkhole. They, too, were looking to claw their way out.\u201cThe No. 1 search phrase on Google that takes people to my blog is \u2018I want to die,\u2019\u201d Mr. Altucher said.But Mr. Altucher seems like an unlikely person to look to for solace. Bookish, contrarian and given to speaking in staccato bursts, this skinny computer geek from North Brunswick, N.J., is like the anti-Anthony Robbins, the strapping self-help star.His regular-guy appearance turned out to be a plus, as he developed a following blogging about his win-some-lose-some \u201clife hacker\u201d experiments.It helped that Mr. Altucher, despite his biting views on topics like college, maintained a positive tone. \u201cI am an optimist,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a great novel from the \u201860s by Richard Fari\u00f1a called \u2018Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me.\u2019 Basically, I\u2019ve been down on the floor so many times, I know now that I can always bounce back, and it gets faster each time.\u201dHis philosophy is perhaps most clearly articulated in \u201cChoose Yourself,\u201d which he summarized over lunch like this: \u201cIf you don\u2019t choose the life you want to live, chances are, someone else is going to choose it for you. And the results are probably not going to be pretty.\u201dChapters include \u201cHow to Be Less Stupid\u201d (\u201cI lose at least 20 percent of my intelligence when I am resentful\u201d) and \u201cThe Seven Habits of Highly Effective Mediocre People\u201d (procrastination, he writes, \u201cis your body telling you that you need to back off a bit and think more about what you are doing\u201d).He calls them the four pillars of happiness. \u201cA chair needs four legs to be stable,\u201d he said.And there has never been a better time to choose yourself, he said.He would know. \u201cChoose Yourself,\u201d which Mr. Altucher self-published on Amazon, sold more than a half-million copies, he said, and made The Wall Street Journal\u2019s best-seller list.Mr. Altucher, in fact, disputes that he is a guru in the first place. \u201cI am not a self-help guy at all,\u201d he said.\u201cAdvice is autobiography,\u201d he added. \u201cI only say what has worked for me, and then others can choose to try it or not.\u201dBesides, what worked yesterday may not work tomorrow.\u201cIt\u2019s like Mike Tyson says,\u201d Mr. Altucher said. \u201c\u2018Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.\u2019\u201dAn article on Aug. 7 about the self-help guru James Altucher misstated the name of a website where people may learn basic web development.

{"Headline": "Ursula Le Guin Has Earned a Rare Honor. Just Don\u2019t Call Her a Sci-Fi Writer.", "Date": "2016-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPORTLAND, Ore. \u2014 If you\u2019re a big-deal American writer, you hope for a couple of things to cement your legacy. Finding out one fine October morning that your presence is being requested in Sweden would be ideal. Almost as good is enshrinement in the Library of America, the closest thing to immortality between hardcovers.The Library of America usually restricts itself to Melville, Twain, Hawthorne and the other distinguished dead. But a handful of times it has been so sure of a novelist\u2019s importance that its austere black volumes started appearing while the writer was still alive. Eudora Welty, Saul Bellow and Philip Roth got the call.Ursula K. Le Guin is now on this very shortlist. The library\u2019s original idea was to begin with some of her classic science fiction. But she pressed it to start instead with a volume of her lesser-known work.\u201cThere\u2019s some innate arrogance here: I want to do it my way,\u201d Ms. Le Guin said in an interview at her home here. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be reduced to being \u2018the sci-fi writer.\u2019 People are always trying to push me off the literary scene, and to hell with it.\u201dShe chuckled. \u201cI won\u2019t be pushed.\u201dThe result is that Ms. Le Guin\u2019s \u201cThe Complete Orsinia\u201d is being published on Sept. 6 as Library of America Vol. 281. It includes a little-known novel, \u201cMalafrena,\u201d set in an imaginary Central European country, and 13 related stories. The material spans the first half of Ms. Le Guin\u2019s career, from her first published story in 1961 to 1990.It is definitely not science fiction, and not quite fantasy either. Ms. Le Guin\u2019s more casual fans, she acknowledged, might be surprised by it \u2014 a realistic work set in the early 19th century, a tale of a hopeful revolutionary at a moment when revolutions are impossible.\u201cSomeone who pigeonholed me firmly will say, \u2018What the hell?\u2019 But that\u2019s their problem.\u201dMs. Le Guin is 86. She says \u201cwhat the hell\u201d a lot. She is too old, she says, to get on airplanes or even do events in Portland beyond an occasional bookstore appearance. So the world comes to her \u2014 up a hill, past a sign marked \u201cno outlet,\u201d across a bridge spanning a ravine too deep for trolls.Her 1899 house is shielded by pink, yellow and red roses. In the living room there is a volume of word puzzles on a table and the books Ms. Le Guin and her husband, Charles, a retired historian, are reading aloud at night (\u201cTwo Years Before the Mast\u201d and the poetry of Theodore Roethke). There is not a clue that anyone who lives here is a writer, much less America\u2019s greatest living science fiction writer.This early work was done at the margins of the culture. \u201cA Wizard of Earthsea\u201d (1968), now regarded as one of the great fantasies of the era, was published by a small press in Berkeley, Calif. \u201cThe Left Hand of Darkness\u201d (1969), probably her most influential work, was issued as a 95-cent mass-market paperback.\u201cI published as a genre writer when genre was not literature,\u201d she said. \u201cI paid the price, you could say. Don DeLillo, who comes off as literary without question, takes the award over me\u201d \u2014 at the 1985 National Book Awards \u2014 \u201cbecause I published in genre and he didn\u2019t. Also, he\u2019s a man and I\u2019m a woman.\u201d (Mr. DeLillo won for \u201cWhite Noise\u201d; her book, \u201cAlways Coming Home,\u201d was about a far-future California utopia.)Mellowing with age is clearly not Ms. Le Guin\u2019s style. In 2014, she received the National Book Foundation\u2019s Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters. She spent six months writing her six-minute speech.\u201cWho was I to spit in the publishers\u2019 punch bowl at the annual industry party?\u201d she recounts in \u201cWords Are My Matter,\u201d a collection of nonfiction appearing this fall from Small Beer Press. \u201cWell, I was, in fact, the one to do it. So I did it.\u201dShe used her speech to decry \u201ccommodity profiteers\u201d who sold writers \u201clike deodorant, and tell us what to publish, what to write.\u201d She criticized our \u201cobsessive technologies\u201d that promote fear and greed.The speech, and her outrage, went viral. \u201cA writer in her mid-80s simply has less to lose,\u201d she said. \u201cAn author in midcareer who defies the hegemony of Google and Amazon, and names their immoral or unfair practices as such, takes an immediate risk of vengeance from them and of enmity from fellow writers who are cozy with them. I\u2019m taking the same risks, but what the hell. My work is out there \u2014 visible, existent.\u201d\u201cThat story is both a call and a practice for Le Guin,\u201d Mr. Diaz said. \u201cShe has spent all these decades trying to chart a path for those who wish to walk away from Omelas \u2014 also known as the horror of our civilization.\u201d\u201cThe Complete Orsinia\u201d is Ms. Le Guin in a quieter key. \u201cThe editorial challenge of the Library of America is to strike a balance,\u201d said Max Rudin, the library\u2019s publisher. \u201cOn the one hand to publish writers and works that are indisputably part of the American canon, and on the other hand to publish books that stretch people\u2019s imagination of what great American writing is.\u201dIn the introduction, she quotes from a 1975 notebook in which she wrote that much of her work was concerned with one central notion: \u201cTrue pilgrimage consists in coming home.\u201d The hero of \u201cMalafrena\u201d must leave his provincial farm only to find it again.\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between the circle and the spiral,\u201d Ms. Le Guin said. \u201cWe say the Earth has a circular orbit around the sun, but of course it doesn\u2019t. You never come back to the same place, you just come back to the same point on the spiral. That image is very deep in my thinking.\u201d\u201cOrsinia\u201d has another spiral: As Ms. Le Guin\u2019s works are being put in the canon, she has largely stopped writing. \u201cThe fiction isn\u2019t coming. You can\u2019t get water from a dry well.\u201d She still writes poetry, which is a consolation.There remains that other big legacy-cementing possibility. Last year, Ms. Le Guin was given Nobel odds of 25-1. Her conclusion: \u201cAll I have to do in the next 25 years is outlive the other 24 writers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Legg Mason, which is based in Baltimore, said Thursday that Mr. Miller had agreed to purchase the entirety of the firm\u2019s interests in LMM, giving him full ownership of the entity.In the 1990s and the early part of the 2000s, Mr. Miller was the Joe DiMaggio of mutual fund investors, achieving fame for beating the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index for 15 consecutive years, from 1991 to 2005.But with the advent of exchange-traded funds and the investing public\u2019s embrace of passive, low-cost investing as opposed to active stock picking, Mr. Miller\u2019s style has fallen out of favor.A deep-value investor who made big, concentrated bets on a select number of companies and then stuck with them through their worst days, Mr. Miller embodied the active style of mutual fund investing that prevailed in the earlier era.And even though stocks of technology companies are not typically what value investors buy, he was an early booster of AOL and Dell and was among the first mutual fund managers that bet big on Amazon.In its heyday, Legg Mason Value Trust was one of the biggest, most popular mutual funds around, and Mr. Miller regularly graced the covers of the many personal finance magazines that flourished during this period.But Mr. Miller\u2019s stubborn style of investing hurt him during the 2008 financial crisis, when he accumulated big positions in Bear Stearns, Freddie Mac, the American International Group and other struggling financial stocks.Although he recovered from these depths, the assets he managed at Legg Mason were of a considerably smaller size.In recent years, Legg Mason has branched out aggressively into E.T.F.\u2019s, investment vehicles that track an index or mimic a style of investing and that have attracted billions of dollars in investor money \u2014 much of which has come from underperforming, actively managed mutual funds.\u201cBill has been an important part of the growth and success of Legg Mason over the years and we appreciate his many contributions,\u201d Joseph A.

If Rackspace\u2019s strategic shift to sell services on these platforms succeeds, Apollo will have a nice payday.About 70 percent of Rackspace\u2019s revenue comes from managing server farms for individual companies. That is a stable but relatively low-growth business. The excitement has come from its public cloud operations, where it competes against Amazon Web Services and Microsoft\u2019s Azure, selling on-demand computing and services.The problem is this is a business of scale. Bigger companies can negotiate to buy servers and power for less, and deploy gear more effectively. So Amazon and Microsoft can offer better deals to customers without suffering a big hit to margins.Rackspace is trying a bit of jujitsu. While it is not abandoning its efforts, the company realizes it cannot effectively compete with Amazon and Microsoft. So it has become a partner, selling services and helping companies connect their data and software to Amazon Web Services and Azure. There is an additional benefit to Apollo. It takes a lot less capital to offer consulting services than to build and run server farms.There is risk. While its existing business of managing server farms for individual businesses probably will provide enough cash flow to cover costs and service debt, success will rely on its new partnerships taking off. That may not happen. Customers may wonder whether it makes sense to pay for additional support and services, especially as Amazon and Microsoft continually make their web services easier to use. The growth of cloud computing, however, may mean there\u2019s plenty of room on the Amazon and Microsoft bandwagons.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Big Pause You Should Take Before Co-Signing a Student Loan", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "Supported byYour MoneySo someone has asked you to co-sign for a student loan.Chances are, it\u2019s your child or grandchild, or perhaps a niece or nephew. You have unrelenting faith in this teenage freshman, or near certainty that graduate school will lead to a lifetime of gainful employment. And maybe you feel badly that the family has not been able to save enough to pay the bills outright.Fine. But be very, very careful.When you co-sign for a loan, you, too, are responsible for it. If the primary borrower can\u2019t pay, you have to. If that borrower pays late, your credit could get nicked as well. And the mere existence of the loan on your credit report may keep you from being able to get other kinds of loans, since lenders don\u2019t always want to do business with people who already have a lot of debt.The $102 billion in outstanding private student loans make up just 7.5 percent of the $1.36 trillion in total student loan debt; the rest is made up of federal student loans. Undergraduates, however, can borrow only so much each year from the federal government before hitting limits.Most private lenders require borrowers to have a co-signer to get a loan at all or to get a better rate. During the 2015-16 academic year, 94 percent of new undergraduate private loans had a co-signer, while 61 percent of graduate school loans did, according to MeasureOne\u2019s analysis of data from six large lenders that make up about two-thirds of the overall market.For graduate students, the numbers were 4.59 percent for duos and 6.21 percent for people going it alone. For its average undergraduate loan \u2014 $19,232, paid off in eight years \u2014 the savings over time would be $1,896, which comes to about $20 a month.A guide to student loans at various universities, and what it takes after graduation to repay that debt.But Sallie Mae said that more than half of its borrowers who make this request succeed. For PNC, the figure was 45 percent for the last 12 months. Citizens Bank reported a 64 percent number, while Wells Fargo said so few people had asked for a release that it did not track the number. (It\u2019s possible that many don\u2019t know that it\u2019s possible, as the bureau chided lenders for not making the rules clear.)What accounts for this gap? The bureau\u2019s sample includes many loans that the original lenders sold to investors. These anonymous loan owners may not have the same incentive to be customer-friendly as big-name banks.Some co-signers can\u2019t get a release because the primary borrower doesn\u2019t have sufficient income or a good enough credit score \u2014 fair and square. But sometimes it\u2019s neither fair nor square. The bureau reports numerous instances where people make several months\u2019 worth of payments in a lump sum but then don\u2019t get credit for the consecutive monthly payments that some lenders use to keep score on people who are aiming to release their co-signers.Worse still, co-signers who make payments themselves may discover after the fact that the lender requires the primary borrower to make years of on-time monthly payments before it will consider a release. So efforts by the co-signer to help the primary borrower stay on track may foil their very attempt to get themselves off the loan later.There are rarer horrors, too, where the death or the bankruptcy of the co-signer causes an automatic default, according to the bureau. At that point, a mourning child can receive a bill for the full balance, and debt collectors may chase after the executor of the estate for a dead grandfather who co-signed a loan years ago. The big banks that offer private student loans say they do no such things.As for more likely events, like credit-sullying late payments, just 4.37 percent of borrowers were at least 30 days late on their loans at the end of the first quarter, according to MeasureOne\u2019s look at the big private lenders. But it\u2019s not necessarily the same 4.37 percent who are overdue at any given moment. Moreover, that number will go higher during the next downturn, and there might be more than one bad economic cycle during any individual\u2019s tenure as a co-signer.So where does this leave someone trying to help and tempted to co-sign? The tough-love reply goes like this: If you need a private loan as an undergraduate especially, then your college of choice is simply not affordable. Federal loans plus savings and current income should be enough to pay all of your costs, and if they aren\u2019t, then it\u2019s community college and living at home for you. And no, we won\u2019t take the debt on in our names only or yank money from home equity, since we need to think about retirement and not be a burden to you later.But can you really bring yourself, as a parent in particular, to deny a teenager or an ambitious graduate student a shot at the better opportunities that a more prestigious and expensive school might bring, as long as the debt isn\u2019t outsize? Even an aspiring engineer who will earn plenty?Many people simply will not be able to say no. So a few words for them. First, keep in mind that the teenagers you\u2019re betting on may never graduate. And if they don\u2019t, the odds are higher of the co-signer being liable for the private loan while the college dropout earns a modest hourly wage. So be especially wary if you think there is even a chance that your child or grandchild is not committed to college.Finally, look the primary borrower in the eye and draw out a commitment of total and utter transparency. \u201cDon\u2019t assume that the primary borrower is making the payments, and make sure you have an open enough dialogue that they will tell you about it before they miss that payment,\u201d said Dan Macklin, co-founder of SoFi, a company that helps many people refinance older student loans. \u201cI\u2019ve seen too many people where it\u2019s an embarrassment and not spoken about, and it\u2019s not very healthy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple, Congress and the Missing Taxes", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialApple and the United States are crying foul over the ruling in Europe that Apple received illegal tax breaks from Ireland and must hand over 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion), a record tax penalty in Europe.But Apple and the United States have only themselves to blame for the situation.Initially, deferral was a convenience for multinationals, as they sought investment opportunities abroad. Today, it is the taproot of global tax avoidance. Financial engineering has let American companies shift profits into foreign accounts, while they lobby Congress for tax-rate cuts in exchange for repatriating the money. Currently, there is some $2 trillion in corporate profits in offshore tax-deferred accounts; besides Apple, Microsoft, Google, Cisco and Oracle also have large stashes. Apple is one of nearly two dozen major corporations pushing Congress for a \u201ctax holiday,\u201d which would let companies bring back foreign-held money over the course of a year at a discounted tax rate, rather than the current rate, 35 percent.Before the European ruling on Tuesday, the debate over a tax holiday had pitted Republicans, who have generally favored the idea, against Democrats, who have viewed it as an unjustified reward for tax avoidance. The Democrats have history on their side. A tax holiday in 2005 lowered the corporate rate to 5.25 percent, enticing corporations to repatriate some $300 billion. It was billed as a way to create jobs and increase investment, but the money was used mostly for dividend payments, share buybacks (which tend to raise executive pay) and severance for laid-off employees. Worse, the tax holiday inspired multinationals to stash as much money abroad as they possibly could in anticipation of another holiday.The European ruling, however, could sharply alter the terms of the congressional debate. Republicans and Democrats alike have always assumed that foreign-held profits would one day be repatriated. The big question was the rate at which they would ultimately be taxed. Similarly, the Treasury assumes that deferred foreign profits will one day be taxed when it projects future revenues \u2014 an important measure of the nation\u2019s fiscal health.But the money won\u2019t be repatriated and taxed under American law if Europeans, in the course of enforcing their own laws against tax havens, get their hands on it first. And that, in a nutshell, is why members of Congress and Treasury officials are so upset about the Apple ruling. They understand, correctly, that tax-law enforcement in Europe could reduce the sums they expect to collect taxes on someday. What they don\u2019t understand, or aren\u2019t saying, is that they brought the problem on themselves.The way forward is not to declare a tax war with Europe. It is for Congress to agree on a way to tax foreign-held corporate profits. President Obama put forth a reasonable approach in 2015, when he proposed a mandatory 14 percent tax on multinationals\u2019 current offshore profits \u2014 whether they are repatriated or not \u2014 and, thereafter, a new minimum tax rate of 19 percent on profits moved offshore. An even better approach would be to simply end indefinite corporate tax deferral, imposing American taxes on profits when they are made.Republicans rejected Mr. Obama\u2019s proposal in 2015, and there is no chance that lawmakers will engage in such a debate so close to the election. But the next president and Congress will need to act to ensure that at long last, American corporations pay their fair share in taxes.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Halt and Catch Fire\u2019 Clears Its Cache for Season 3", "Date": "2016-08-19", "News": "Supported byATLANTA \u2014 When it comes to AMC\u2019s 1980s tech drama \u201cHalt and Catch Fire,\u201d its main cast members have been one of the show\u2019s few constants. The relationships, subject matter and locations have all gotten a CTRL-ALT-DEL at the outset of each of the show\u2019s three 10-episode seasons.The series, which debuted in 2014 one week after the \u201cMad Men\u201d midseason finale, shared that show\u2019s time slot as well as its workplace vibe, enigmatic antihero (here, Lee Pace from \u201cPushing Daisies\u201d) and intricate engagement with historical events. The characters and stories on \u201cHalt\u201d are fictional but run alongside the early histories of companies like Hewlett-Packard, Apple and IBM, which was a major presence in each of the show\u2019s first two seasons.\u201cHalt and Catch Fire,\u201d a phrase that refers to a computer problem that necessitates a reboot, is appropriate for a show that has gone through a number of permutations: It began as a series about the emergence of personal computing, pivoted into one about the genesis of online communities, and is now moving from Texas to Silicon Valley to focus on the development of internet commerce.There\u2019s also a reboot behind the camera. The new season, which begins on Tuesday, Aug. 23, will be the first with Christopher Cantwell and Christopher C. Rogers as showrunners; they created the series and worked for two seasons under the showrunner Jonathan Lisco, who left to create this summer\u2019s TNT series \u201cAnimal Kingdom.\u201dOn a soundstage here in June, Mr. Rogers explained that the tech industry, even in the \u201980s, was in a state of constant change. \u201cThe industry was so much about failing fast, figuring out what went wrong and making a whole new thing out of it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting every year, because we\u2019re starting over in a sense, and at this point we have an emotional back story with these characters that we can bring to new scenarios.\u201dThe first season centered on a computer executive (Mr. Pace) and a hardware genius (Scoot McNairy) who hack the market-leading IBM computer and build a lighter, faster version called the Giant. They start a PC division from scratch at the electronics company where they work and bring the Giant to market with bravado, cunning and gamesmanship.\u201cSeason 1 was almost a corporate thriller that had a clandestine, fun, sexy, dark feeling to it,\u201d said Kerry Bish\u00e9, whose character, Donna Clark, evolved from a risk-averse Texas Instruments assistant to a reluctant entrepreneur. \u201cWe\u2019re a world away from that now.\u201dIn Season 2, Mr. Pace and Mr. McNairy\u2019s characters went their separate ways, and the focus shifted to the origin story of a fictional online community called Mutiny that was a precursor to dial-up services like CompuServe and AOL. Mackenzie Davis, whose Cameron Howe was a supporting character in the first season, and Ms. Bish\u00e9\u2019s Donna start Mutiny as an outlet for online games and spend the season figuring out whether games or chat rooms have the brighter future.The more fluid and collaborative approach that the women took with Mutiny was in pointed contrast to the schemes and power games that the men undertook in developing the Giant. It was a shift that many critics focused on when praising the second season, but one that Ms. Davis and Ms. Bish\u00e9 play down.Ms. Davis said the show has never emphasized the characters\u2019 gender. \u201cIt comes up, but the Chrises [Mr. Rogers and Mr. Cantwell] are more interested in what it\u2019s like for entrepreneurs and idealists and ambitious people to succeed greatly and to fail greatly rather than focusing on the fact that they\u2019re women.\u201dMs. Bish\u00e9 added, \u201cMackenzie and I are of the mind that we treat these characters as people first, and whatever conclusion an audience draws about them being women is almost incidental.\u201dThe new season follows Mutiny\u2019s expansion from a dial-up service, which had to lease server space, to a 100,000-user community with its own mainframe. And while it is set in 1986, the issues \u2014 online privacy, technology creeping into people\u2019s daily lives, even recreational marijuana use \u2014 are strikingly contemporary.\u201cI.P.O. culture and the way Silicon Valley is with money and the progression of women in power are certainly in the ether right now,\u201d Ms. Davis said.AMC\u2019s \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d which ended in 2013, grew over time as viewers found earlier seasons of the series on Netflix, caught up and came back to AMC for later seasons. Streaming services have created a new revenue stream for networks like AMC, but the idea that Netflix viewers would come back to AMC for new seasons of shows has not borne out.\u201cEven with the emergence of Netflix, Hulu and Amazon, season-to-season growth is a real rarity,\u201d said Joel Stillerman, president of original programming and development for AMC. \u201cThere is a tiny handful of shows launched in the era of streaming video that have had season-to-season growth. \u2018Breaking Bad\u2019 was perfectly timed to take advantage of the emergence of Netflix, but it has not worked out that having a show on Netflix leads to bigger ratings.\u201dHBO\u2019s \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d lampoons the arrogant grandeur of today\u2019s tech industry, and shows like USA\u2019s \u201cMr. Robot\u201d and Netflix\u2019s \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d examine the darker aspects of tech in our lives. But in continuing to reinvent itself, \u201cHalt and Catch Fire\u201d is a stripped-down exploration of those ideas that began in the 1980s.\u201cThere were major players in Silicon Valley by that time,\u201d Mr. Cantwell said. \u201cOur characters are coming into that as the new kids on the block. They think they can play in the big leagues now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Women\u2019s Soccer Team Fights to Quiet What-Ifs in Tough Win Over France", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 In winning the 2015 women\u2019s World Cup, the United States was fortunate to avoid a surprisingly strong French club that lost to Germany in a quarterfinal game in which France seemed to be the better team.So Saturday\u2019s first-round match between the Americans and the French was, in some ways, the World Cup game that never happened. The United States scored the only goal at the Mineir\u00e3o stadium in Belo Horizonte, where the crowd again jeered the American goalkeeper Hope Solo and the French created most of the scoring chances.The 1-0 victory was the Americans\u2019 second straight, and it moved them into the quarterfinals of the tournament, although they still have one more game to play in the first round \u2014 against Colombia, in the Amazon.The French, who beat Colombia in their first game and still must play New Zealand, are likely to advance, too. It would not be surprising if the United States and France faced each other again in the gold medal final in Rio de Janeiro.The goal came in the 63rd minute when Tobin Heath fired a shot that deflected off the right post and landed near Carli Lloyd, the United States\u2019 captain, who quickly knocked the ball into the net.Before and after Lloyd\u2019s goal, the French created scary moments for the Americans. But whenever they did, Solo got in the way and kept France from scoring. Late in the first half, Marie Laure Delie broke in alone on Solo\u2019s left and fired a shot that Solo managed to smother between her legs.And then, 76 minutes into the game, Solo made a split-second save on a close-in header. That kept the score at 1-0.France outshot the Americans, 14-7, and had eight corners compared with three for the Americans. France also hit the crossbar on a free kick in the 16th minute of the first half on a shot that the leaping Solo was just able to deflect slightly upward.All of Solo\u2019s fine play came with a derisive soundtrack. As was the case in the same stadium on Wednesday, when the United States beat New Zealand, 2-0, the crowd was on Solo\u2019s case every time the ball came her way. When she grabbed it in her hands there were loud boos. When she kicked it downfield, there were derisive cries of \u201cZika!\u2019\u2019Solo has been targeted because of several Twitter posts she made in July in reference to mosquitoes and the Zika virus. She may have thought the posts were funny, but Brazilians clearly did not. One included a photo of Solo wearing what appeared to be a beekeeper\u2019s mask; another showed dozens of containers of insect repellent spread across a bed.Although Solo subsequently expressed sympathy for the people of Brazil when she and her teammates arrived here, not all has been forgiven, and there is the distinct possibility the jeers will follow her the rest of the tournament. Not that any of this seems to be bothering her.Aside from Solo, the rest of the American team had a fairly modest game. On offense, Crystal Dunn started in place of Mallory Pugh, although Dunn did not have the impact that she did when she came on in the second half Wednesday, her debut as an Olympian. On defense, Whitney Engen replaced the injured Julie Johnston.Still not getting on the field was Megan Rapinoe, who has yet to play since ripping up her knee last December. Without her clever passing, the American attack was uninspiring. Alex Morgan and Morgan Brian had brief moments when it looked as if they were about to score, but neither put the ball in the net. But Lloyd did, and Solo did the rest, and the United States, which did not lose a game in last year\u2019s World Cup, has yet to lose one here, either.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook Helps Develop Software That Puts Students in Charge of Their Lesson Plans", "Date": "2016-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPriscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook, last month. They were the catalysts for Facebook\u2019s partnership to build classroom software with Summit Public Schools.Facebook is out to upend the traditional student-teacher relationship.Rather than have teachers hand out class assignments, the Facebook-Summit learning management system puts students in charge of selecting their projects and setting their pace. The idea is to encourage students to develop skills, like resourcefulness and time management, that might help them succeed in college.\u201cAs parents and kids and teachers get access to this type of learning, I think more and more will want it,\u201d Diane Tavenner, the co-founder and chief executive of Summit Public Schools, said in a telephone interview.But the Summit-Facebook system, called the \u201cSummit Personalized Learning Platform,\u201d is different.The software gives students a full view of their academic responsibilities for the year in each class and breaks them down into customizable lesson modules they can tackle at their own pace. A student working on a science assignment, for example, may choose to create a project using video, text or audio files. Students may also work asynchronously, tackling different sections of the year\u2019s work at the same time.The system inverts the traditional teacher-led classroom hierarchy, requiring schools to provide intensive one-on-one mentoring and coaching to help each student adapt.This summer, more than 1,500 educators and leaders of public, private and charter schools participating in the program, called Summit Basecamp, attended sessions to learn how to use the system. Among the 19 schools that introduced the new learning approach last year, at least a few educators and administrators reported a steep learning curve.\u201cThere were many points where we weren\u2019t sure the Summit Basecamp model was what our students needed,\u201d said Claire Fisher, the principal of Urban Promise Academy, a public middle school in Oakland, Calif., which introduced the platform in its sixth-grade classes.By the end of the school year, however, 31 percent of the school\u2019s sixth graders were reading at or above their grade level, compared with just 9 percent in the fall. That was a larger improvement in reading than students in seventh and eighth grades, which did not use the platform, Ms. Fisher said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Criticism\u2019s Sting: The Author Curtis Sittenfeld on Book Reviews", "Date": "2016-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byO.K., the obvious questions first: Do you read all your reviews?No. I read more of the early ones and more of the ones from publications I respect. I think of reviews being mapped on a graph with four quadrants, and I\u2019ll read the ones that are smart and positive, smart and negative, or dumb and positive (hey, all our egos need a little sustenance!). But there\u2019s no point in reading a dumb, negative review.You\u2019ve now written five books. Your feelings toward reviews must have evolved over the years, yes? I take criticism less personally, and I recognize that sometimes fate smiles on you and sometimes it doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m aware more than I was before I had books published that any review is a bit arbitrary \u2014 it\u2019s not really, say, The New York Times that\u2019s authoritatively weighing in on the quality of a book, though it seems this way to the public. It\u2019s actually one reviewer weighing in (maybe a daily reviewer like you, but maybe a random novelist like me who reviews one or two books a year), and all of us as individuals have quirky, subjective taste.When my first book, \u201cPrep,\u201d was published, I also realized I had to accept that many reviews would contain factual errors, and some would misunderstand the book. Unless you receive a rave, especially in The Times, it\u2019s tempting to write a letter to set the record straight, but I literally don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever read a letter from a writer complaining about his or her negative review that made the writer look good. You\u2019re better off just biting your tongue.Which review was the most hurtful, and how did you react to it? Reassuring, believe me.Which review was the most gratifying, and how did you react to that? Which one (if any) was the most helpful/constructive?When my second novel came out, I read a brief review on Amazon by a total stranger, and the person basically said, \u201cThis book is O.K., but Curtis Sittenfeld is capable of a lot more, and I wish she had challenged herself.\u201d This was like the kind version of The Times review I mentioned above, and its kindness made me feel both even more embarrassed but also a lot more inspired. After \u201cAmerican Wife\u201d came out \u2014 and \u201cA.W.\u201d was definitely a book where I had challenged myself \u2014 this same person posted a review that was something like: \u201cBravo, Curtis! I knew you could do it.\u201d I will always have an enormous soft spot in my heart for you, Random Anonymous Amazon Reviewer.Do you have a nightmare reviewer? You do not have to name this person, just curious if you do.The nightmare reviewer is the reviewer who has some sort of agenda that precludes him or her responding sincerely to the book. Often that agenda is seeming clever and/or taking someone who has received more than her fair share of attention down a notch. But again, there are people who are just on a different wavelength from you, and it\u2019s not that they misunderstand your book \u2014 it\u2019s that they really in their heart of hearts don\u2019t like it. That\u2019s actually fair.Do you like doing criticism yourself?My husband pointed out to me years ago that there\u2019s something strange about novelists\u2019 reviewing other novelists\u2019 books \u2014 we all have too much dog in the fight. And, say, Meryl Streep would never review another actress\u2019s performance. (Maybe one of the reasons I\u2019m married to my husband is that I get to be Meryl Streep in this analogy?) So, I consider writing reviews a professional minefield, and then an editor reaches out and asks if I\u2019d like to review a book that I really want to read, and because I am a nerdy writer, I find it fun to analyze books, to sort of take them apart and see what made them work or not work. Thus, against my better judgment, I say yes.What is the one thing that someone could say to you that would send you over the moon? Or under a desk?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Debt. Terror. Politics. To Seattle Millennials, the Future Looks Scary.", "Date": "2016-08-18", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Part of Jillian Boshart\u2019s life plays out in tidy, ordered lines of JavaScript computer code, and part in a flamboyant whirl of corsets and crinoline. She\u2019s a tech student by day, an enthusiastic burlesque artist and producer by night. \u201cCode-mode\u201d and \u201cshow-mode,\u201d she calls those different guises.\u201cMy mother got stage fright for me,\u201d she said on a recent night while talking about her childhood performances and dreams. She looked like a 1940s starlet in a tight black sequined dress, a red rose pinned into her red hair. \u201cI like to be prepared,\u201d she said. \u201cI like to be in control.\u201dAt age 31, she seems to be. This year she won a coveted spot here at a nonprofit tech school for women, whose recent graduates have found jobs with starting salaries averaging more than $90,000 a year. Seattle, where she came after college in Utah to study musical theater, is booming with culture and youthful energy.But again and again, life has taught Ms. Boshart, and others in her generation, that control can be elusive. In the dot-com crash of the early 2000s, her family lost the college savings they had been putting aside for her. Her father, a nurse, was laid off after 35 years on the job. Her sister and brother-in-law lost their house during the Great Recession. And very little in the world around Ms. Boshart has led her to feel a sense of comfort and ease: not the soaring costs of living in Seattle, not the whirlwind roar of reinvention in the tech world, certainly not the barbed clamor of national politics.Even for someone who seems to have drawn one of her generation\u2019s winning hands, it feels like a daunting time to be coming of age in America.\u201cI don\u2019t just expect things to unfold, or think, \u2018Well, now I\u2019ve got it made,\u2019 because there\u2019s always a turn just ahead of you and you don\u2019t know what\u2019s around that corner,\u201d she said.On the 10th floor of a downtown office building here on a rainy morning in June, a software development instructor stood in a darkened classroom, the images and words from a screen projection branding his white shirt with the fractured punctuation-mark language of computer code.The students at Ada \u2014 Adies, as they affectionately call one other \u2014 are in many ways representative of Seattle\u2019s churning, anxious arc of growth and change. The 61 women who have graduated since the school\u2019s founding in 2013 have been drawn here from across the nation and several other countries. Tuition is free for applicants who pass the rigorous admissions process, with costs underwritten by Seattle tech giants like Amazon.Of the 13 most populous counties in the nation, King County in the Seattle metro area is second only to Brooklyn in the highest percentage of residents age 25 to 34, part of the biggest demographic wave since the baby boom, according to census data. And Seattle is luring those millennials from all over, with King ranking second among big counties in the percentage of people who moved here within the past year from another state.But even in a place of alluring opportunity, the Adies, like Ms. Boshart, mirror their generation\u2019s anxieties.Hailey Willis, for example, was accepted to Ada and arrived here last year from Chicago with six months of savings to her name. In Seattle, markedly more expensive, the money was gone in 90 days. Asked about her financial future, Ms. Willis, 31, said she saw no chance that anything like Social Security would be there for her or anyone her age.Elsa Moluf, 26, an Ada graduate, said the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, still resonated when she thought about personal safety \u2014 a feeling compounded recently by a shooting on a Seattle street in broad daylight only a few feet from her. \u201cIn the era of terrorism, I think about stuff like, \u2018If I go to this crowded festival, what are the chances,\u2019 \u201d she said.Baby boomers, to whom millennials are often compared \u2014 if only by the force of their numbers \u2014 also reached adulthood amid tumult and angst, during the Vietnam War and the struggle for civil rights. But people now in their 20s and 30s say that the 1960s were different, that there seemed to be a clearer goal then \u2014 to end racial segregation, poverty or the war. The economy seemed better and the nation\u2019s future more assured.Now, from niche anxieties like genetically modified crops to defining ones like climate change, questions feel open-ended and unprecedented: Is the food we eat still food? How do you get your head around a threat to the entire planet?Contradictions and paradoxes, millennials say, come with the territory. Ms. Boshart, for example, would love to own a house someday. But at the same time, debt to her feels perilous. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be beholden to any bank, ever,\u201d she said with quiet vehemence. She counts the months until the tech job she hopes to get after Ada can help pay off the $22,000 student debt she has left.And then there are presidential politics, with one candidate, Donald J. Trump, who scares her to death and another, Hillary Clinton, whom she admires but is sometimes hesitant to praise too loudly in an area where most people she knew supported Senator Bernie Sanders.She sees politics through a feminist lens and believes that women\u2019s rights would be undermined by a Trump presidency and a Trump-selected Supreme Court. And even though recent polls and surveys show Sanders supporters largely rallying to Mrs. Clinton, it is not enough to create any sense of security, Ms. Boshart said, that an October surprise of hacked data or a hidden pool of misogyny and rage do not still lie in wait.\u201cThere are just so many things you can be anxious about \u2014 it\u2019s an anxious time,\u201d she said. \u201cMy biggest fear is that America hates women more than they hate Donald Trump.\u201dRiley Spicer, 26, said she cannot help buying food on sale and socking it away. She arrived in Seattle last year from rural Oregon to start classes at Ada, and she and her boyfriend, Jakob Lundy, 27, a fireman, have planted a garden and started a beehive to harvest honey.\u201cI had the radishes today in my salad at work,\u201d Ms. Spicer said on a recent evening, as she carefully exposed the leaves to reveal red-topped bulbs. \u201cWhen I go to the store and I get three bags of mushrooms, they\u2019re like, \u2018What are you doing?\u2019 I\u2019m stuffing mushrooms and freezing them \u2014 doesn\u2019t everyone do that?\u201dMs. Spicer, who studied philosophy and the history of science at St. John\u2019s College in Annapolis, Md., has had jobs as a barista, a taxi dispatcher and a deli worker. She has $72,000 of student debt and has never been paid an annual wage, she said, of more than $17,000. Based on the track record of Ada graduates, she could soon be making five times as much.So on one level, she and Mr. Lundy \u2014 young, in love and employed or soon to be \u2014 might look as if they are living the American dream.But neither one is buying it.\u201cI look out there and it just seems completely hopeless to me,\u201d she said as their 12-year-old mutt, Cordelia, wandered through their apartment. \u201cThe political system seems so overwhelmingly broken that I have no idea what to do about it.\u201dMr. Lundy rejects the two-party political system entirely and has voted mostly for third-party candidates, if only as a statement of opposition to the choice of a Republican or a Democrat. He is not sure what he will do this year.\u201cI don\u2019t want to support the false dichotomy,\u201d he said. He said he liked Mr. Sanders partly because a Sanders insurgency \u201cwould be best at reforming the party, or tearing it apart from the inside.\u201d He also applauded Mr. Trump\u2019s antics, which Mr. Lundy believes will shatter the Republican Party, too.Either way, he added, a shake-up is coming. \u201cThings are going to have to burn before they get better,\u201d he said.Technology is the sea that millennials swim in \u2014 a kind of second nature, especially to Adies. But many of them feel a deep ambivalence. Tech, they say, means military drones, loss of privacy and cyberbullying. Social media, the new town square, often feels more like a combat zone than a place to share ideas. Tech companies are driving up rent in places like Seattle, forcing out lower-income people, even while creating excellent jobs that Adies are likely to get.\u201cThe tech industry is a huge part of the problem,\u201d said Jessica Weeber, 31, who is studying at Ada alongside Ms. Boshart. \u201cAs people get paid more and work in tech jobs, rents and housing go up and gentrification happens,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to solve it.\u201dBut tech is also an unquestionably powerful tool.\u201cTech gives us the power to change \u2014 that\u2019s why I\u2019m here,\u201d said Mindy Carson, 31, an Ada student and strong supporter of Mr. Sanders. She wants to start a nonprofit after graduation, using technology to work on social justice issues. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to take what they\u2019re saying on TV for face value, we don\u2019t have to take limited information for face value, because we see the truth, we are connected,\u201d she added.Ms. Boshart used technology in a recent burlesque performance, including a recorded voice-over appearance by the astronomer Carl Sagan, to make a point about humanity\u2019s intertwined role with science.She walked on stage wearing a glamorous evening gown, opera gloves, and a corset underneath with 160 LED lights and a tiny computer to run them. Mr. Sagan\u2019s voice came on, talking about the cosmos. As her clothing came off, she said, \u201cI became more and more human. And that was kind of the point: We are artifice to the world, what we present, but as we get deeper and deeper into the human element we are atoms and star dust.\u201dMs. Boshart gravitated to burlesque, she said, partly to make such statements. But after her mother died last summer, things became more profound and personal. The women of the Seattle Burlesque Society showed up at the apartment she shares with her fianc\u00e9. They brought food. They cleaned. They carved out a quiet corner for grieving and meditation.They became, in their embrace, her sisters. Like many people in her generation, Ms. Boshart does not expect to find those connections in political parties. She no longer goes to church. The workplace doesn\u2019t seem to offer much hope either.\u201cMy dad was laid off after 35 years, and that was supposed to be his community, right? That was supposed to be the group of people that understood,\u201d she said before a recent Monday night performance that she was producing at a brewpub north of downtown. \u201cHe worked for years and years for you and he\u2019s just out? It was appalling to me.\u2019\u2019What should be tossed out, or clung to, is the question of the moment, she said. And for her, a big part of her answer lies in the proud and quirky universe of burlesque, her anchor of belonging in a world that can feel fragmented and frayed.As she got up from the table for a final chat with the cast, music pounded out as performers \u2014 various ages and body types in heavy eye shadow and feathered boas \u2014 got ready to go on. They hugged, and she cautioned them about a low table with sharp corners that would be hard to see in the dark. One small peril avoided, it was time for show-mode.Advertisement"}

Maybe These Devices Should Go Along", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "Supported byTech FixWHEN Vanessa Arreola, 18, starts her freshman year at Stanford University this fall, the top item on her back-to-school wish list is a MacBook Pro.She said she wouldn\u2019t consider a tablet because she prefers a traditional keyboard. She relies on apps like Google Docs for documents and Google Slides for presentations, which are available through a web browser.\u201cA tablet is just like your cellphone, but bigger,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see a point of getting a tablet.\u201dBut Claire Ashcroft, 19, who studies public health at Brigham Young University in Idaho, said the opposite. Half of her textbooks are digitized, and she uses apps like Microsoft Excel and Word \u2014 so her ideal school device would be a Windows machine with a touch screen, like a Microsoft Surface tablet.The polarizing responses illustrate how back-to-school shopping for technology gadgets has become increasingly complex for parents. In the past, the dilemma for most students was whether to get a Windows PC or a Mac. Now, because of a proliferation of different computing forms with the rise of mobile devices, the debate has shifted toward whether to buy a computer or a tablet \u2014 and which operating system on top of that.Then there are the different types of software and tools that students use, like flashcard apps or readers for digital textbooks, some of which are for mobile devices and others for computers.To make back-to-school season easier, parents should have a conversation with their children about what devices and which operating system to buy based on their student\u2019s area of studies and the apps they use.I also compiled a guide to some of the best back-to-school products, including computers, mobile devices, audio accessories and food gadgets. The list was curated after testing dozens of products and interviewing five college students about the tools that help them do homework and get through cramming sessions. (While this list focuses on college students, many of whom will be getting their own computers for the first time, some items would also be a good fit for high schoolers.)The students I polled were split on whether a laptop or tablet would be the best study tool. In general, students in science-oriented fields would probably benefit from a laptop, which can handle multitasking more easily and run more powerful apps than tablets. For designers and liberal arts majors who are using more lightweight apps for writing essays or drawing sketches, a tablet may be a better fit.There are two caveats. First, Apple is expected to release a brand-new iPhone this fall; so if you go the Apple route, it would be wise to wait a few months. Second, these are high-end phones that cost roughly $700, which could easily blow your budget.High-quality audio gear is a sound investment for students.

{"Headline": "Is Hayden a Boy or Girl? Both. \u2018Post-Gender\u2019 Baby Names Are on the Rise.", "Date": "2016-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTheir choice hardly seems unusual in a culture where Heidi Klum, Jessica Simpson and Drew Barrymore have all chosen names for their daughters that could go either way and collectively sound like a frontcourt for the 1962 Detroit Pistons (Lou, for Ms. Klum\u2019s daughter; Maxwell, for Ms. Simpson\u2019s; and Frankie, for Ms. Barrymore\u2019s).The increase was even greater over the last three decades, with the number of unisex baby names having risen 88 percent since 1985.The most popular unisex names in 2015, the researchers found, were Hayden (about 39 percent girls, 61 percent boys) Charlie (about 48 percent girls, 52 percent boys), Emerson (about 60 percent girls, 40 percent boys), Rowan (about 35 percent girls, 65 percent boys), and Finley (about 60 percent girls, 40 percent boys). Rounding out the post-gender Top 10 were River, Dakota, Skyler, Phoenix and Tatum.(For the purposes of the article, Nameberry researchers defined a name as unisex when at least 35 percent of the babies given it were of one sex, and the rest of the other.)Some of the unisex names are novel and could be called the new-parent version of neologisms: Royal, Justice and Phoenix. Others are traditional, and have lost their sex-specific identity over time.Thirty years ago, for example, Tracy was nearly eight times more common for girls than for boys. Last year, there was a nearly 50-50 split between boys and girls named Tracy, according to government data. Similarly, Elliott (in its various spellings) was running almost 100-to-1 in favor of boys years ago; last year, about one Elliott in four was a girl.Other names have seen their gender-specificity eroded more quickly. Boys make up about 38 percent of children named Tatum, but it was 90 percent girls a decade ago, according to Social Security records. Haydens are now about 39 percent girls, up from 11 percent 10 years ago.\u201cThey want their children to grow up and be themselves, free from stereotypes,\u201d she said. \u201cBoys can wear nail polish, girls can ride skateboards. It\u2019s all good.\u201dThe vogue for unisex names is being driven, in part, by millennials, who are in their 20s and early 30s and in their prime child-bearing years. \u201cMillennials are an open-minded and accepting group,\u201d Ms. Murray said, \u201cand they don\u2019t want their children to feel pressured to conform to stereotypes that might be restrictive.\u201dIndeed, marketers have found that gender neutrality is a selling point for millennials raised in an era of growing economic opportunities for women and increasing tolerance for nontraditional gender roles and identities.Raising a child free of gender stereotypes was a goal for Chelsea Marsh, a millennial parent from Fort Wayne, Ind., when she and her husband gave their 6-month-old daughter the either-or name Paris.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go as far as to name my baby girl Jack,\u201d said Ms. Marsh, a 27-year-old sales agent. \u201cBut my goal is to allow her to experience the world without the barriers of pink girlie things. I want her to be strong, play in the dirt and challenge herself to try new things, even if it\u2019s not \u2018what girls do.\u2019\u201d\u201cI would do the same for my son,\u201d she added, \u201cif he wanted to be a dancer instead of a basketball player.\u201dSame-sex parents, whose numbers are growing, may also be inclined to blur traditional gender boundaries.To Yojana Vazquez and her wife, Elaine, choosing the gender-neutral names Kai and Kalo for their twin daughters, now 2, was part of a larger plan to keep gender options open, Ms. Vazquez said.\u201cInstead of always referring to them as our daughters, we say our children or kids,\u201d said Ms. Vazquez, 29, of Springfield, Va. \u201cWe also try to dress them in clothing from all over the children\u2019s department. We mix and match, a pink girlie shirt with a boy\u2019s cargo shorts. A superhero boy\u2019s shirt with a tutu skirt.\u201dThe goal, she said, is \u201cto make sure not to influence them on who they are and, ultimately, who they will grow up to be.\u201dGender-ambiguous names have come into vogue before, Ms. Satran said, first in the 1960s among counterculture types (recall the babies named Sunshine and Rain), and again in the 1980s among baby boomer parents who hoped that giving their daughters names like Blake or Madison would better equip them to take on men in the workplace.Still, unisex baby names account for only a small percentage of those chosen each year. Of the 3.9 million babies born last year, only 1.7 percent were given unisex names, according to Nameberry\u2019s analysis of government data. The most popular baby names in the country continued to be Noah and Liam for boys, and Emma and Olivia for girls.Even so, in an era marked by Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s endlessly publicized transition from Bruce, as well as gender-bending shows like Amazon\u2019s \u201cTransparent,\u201d the unisex baby name may also prove to be in its infancy.\u201cFeminism is cool again, gay marriage is the law of the land and transgender celebrities have come into the mainstream,\u201d said Ms. Satran, the author of 10 baby-name books. \u201cSo who knows? We may yet see the day when boys are named Caitlyn and girls are named Bruce, and nobody thinks twice.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Race and the Olympic Games", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "Supported byAnd now, think Rio.What will the story line of these Games be? To what extent will race be a part of that narrative?Q. The opening ceremony included an acknowledgment of slavery (as captured in the photo above). How would you interpret what was going on there?Rio was the epicenter of this trade, and even within Brazil there is a misconception about how it functioned; many people here still think Salvador in the northeast received far more slaves when that just wasn\u2019t the case.Rio was the economic heart of Brazil at that time and then it was the seat of the empire. It was this linchpin of just a really brutal period in the country\u2019s history. So I think it\u2019s contributing to greater awareness and more discussion about the origins of the country.Somewhat symbolically, the first gold medal winner for Brazil, Rafaela Silva, was also this incredibly gifted competitor in judo and she grew up very poor \u2014 she\u2019s Afro-Brazilian, and she grew up very poor in Cidade de Deus, the City of God, the huge favela where Fernando Meirelles, the director of the opening ceremony, made his film of the same name. And her victory really resonated with a lot of people in Brazil, including in the favela where she was raised.Because back in 2012 when she lost in London, many of Brazil\u2019s sort of more uglier aspects in the debate over race and ethnicity surfaced; she suffered this torrent of abuse on Twitter. One person even called her a monkey. It was really painful to see that tension exploded in that way. She responded to people who were attacking her; her family felt really wounded and insulted.Then when she won her medal, her mom remarked that it was just a real victory for her and her family after everything that had happened.So this tension is bubbling to the surface in different ways in the country in a really interesting fashion.On a related note, Brazil\u2019s indigenous peoples were also portrayed during the opening ceremony, with dances that were similar to what you\u2019d see in the Amazon.But at the same time, there was no mention of the incredible indignities and suffering that indigenous peoples have had to endure in Brazil over the last five centuries, including genocide.There are these stunning discoveries that have been made about how complex societies were across Brazil before the European conquest and little was really made of that, so indigenous leaders are calling attention to that omission and questioning why they\u2019re being left out.Q. Do we know how much of a role the government played in shaping that message?There is a long tradition of this in Brazil going back at least to when the U.S. was segregated, of course, but Brazil was not.At the same time, it\u2019s still clear that racism persists in many ways. This is a country that is majority black and mixed race, according to the latest census figures, and yet if you walked into any corporate board room, or now into the ministry for Brazil\u2019s interim president, you\u2019re not going to find any Afro-Brazilians there. It\u2019s very rare to have Afro-Brazilians in positions of power in the country. It\u2019s just this incredible disconnect.Q. The Olympics seem to reflect that as well; there\u2019s been a fair amount of commentary about the fact that the people working the Games, say selling concessions, tend to be Afro-Brazilians, while those in the stands tend to be white. Are the Olympics bringing Brazilians together or reminding them of that divide? A lot of people were very excited when Rafaela won the medal. Her image was on the front pages of all of Brazil\u2019s major newspapers. Her postvictory interview was so moving; it was impossible not to be touched by that if you\u2019re Brazilian or if you have some connection to Brazil.I certainly felt incredibly moved.But there\u2019s also the realization: This is only two weeks out of the year in Brazil; many things will go back to normal once the Games are finished. This could just be a temporary salve for these issues.Q. Beyond the Olympics, where is Brazil when it comes to race? How does it compare to the United States?But the reality speaks for itself in Brazil: the huge gaps in opportunity in access, in wealth, in living conditions \u2014 that\u2019s so obvious in the country.Something that\u2019s fascinating in Brazil right now is there are these different movements coalescing around the country clamoring for more rights and more access to institutions of power around the country. It\u2019s similar to what we\u2019ve seen in the United States before, but they are also going about it in their own way.Sadly, in Brazil, there is also just a grim sense of acceptance of the inequality that still persists in so many spheres of life in the country.It\u2019s been interesting to witness from afar the debate over #BlackLivesMatter and the killing of police there in the United States because Brazil suffers from the exactly same problem but in a more intense way; far more people are killed by police in Brazil than in the United States, but the public conversation around those killings is really just starting.It\u2019s like many communities are just, I don\u2019t know, bewildered by the challenges they are facing.Advertisement"}

It had belonged to a friend of his grandfather\u2019s. Mr. Madere said he was forgiven.But these are still the early days of drone racing, mostly a sport of part-timers. Mr. Madere, for example, works in a graphic design shop. Another pilot here, Steve Zoumas, 31, works in his family\u2019s contracting firm on Long Island.It is also a sport for do-it-yourselfers, tinkerers and improvisers. Some drone pilots start a day of flying with six or seven drones and go home with only one or two still working. Sometimes the onboard battery fails and the drone does not respond to joystick commands from the remote-control module. And sometimes the drone is nowhere to be found.That race lasted about 25 hours 9 minutes longer than each drone race here.So drone racing is about the thrill of speed, like hot-rodding?\u201cHundred percent,\u201d said Mr. Zoumas, who has a way of saying \u201chundred percent\u201d when he means \u201cyes.\u201dWhat about the high-pitched whistling noise that a drone makes when it is going that fast?

The United States scored the only goal at the Mineir\u00e3o stadium in Belo Horizonte, where the crowd again jeered the American goalkeeper Hope Solo and the French created most of the scoring chances.The 1-0 victory was the Americans\u2019 second straight, and it moved them into the quarterfinals of the tournament, although they still have one more game to play in the first round \u2014 against Colombia, in the Amazon.The French, who beat Colombia in their first game and still must play New Zealand, are likely to advance, too. It would not be surprising if the United States and France faced each other again in the gold medal final in Rio de Janeiro.The goal came in the 63rd minute when Tobin Heath fired a shot that deflected off the right post and landed near Carli Lloyd, the United States\u2019 captain, who quickly knocked the ball into the net.Before and after Lloyd\u2019s goal, the French created scary moments for the Americans. But whenever they did, Solo got in the way and kept France from scoring. Late in the first half, Marie Laure Delie broke in alone on Solo\u2019s left and fired a shot that Solo managed to smother between her legs.And then, 76 minutes into the game, Solo made a split-second save on a close-in header. That kept the score at 1-0.France outshot the Americans, 14-7, and had eight corners compared with three for the Americans. France also hit the crossbar on a free kick in the 16th minute of the first half on a shot that the leaping Solo was just able to deflect slightly upward.All of Solo\u2019s fine play came with a derisive soundtrack. As was the case in the same stadium on Wednesday, when the United States beat New Zealand, 2-0, the crowd was on Solo\u2019s case every time the ball came her way. When she grabbed it in her hands there were loud boos. When she kicked it downfield, there were derisive cries of \u201cZika!\u2019\u2019Solo has been targeted because of several Twitter posts she made in July in reference to mosquitoes and the Zika virus. She may have thought the posts were funny, but Brazilians clearly did not. One included a photo of Solo wearing what appeared to be a beekeeper\u2019s mask; another showed dozens of containers of insect repellent spread across a bed.Although Solo subsequently expressed sympathy for the people of Brazil when she and her teammates arrived here, not all has been forgiven, and there is the distinct possibility the jeers will follow her the rest of the tournament. Not that any of this seems to be bothering her.Aside from Solo, the rest of the American team had a fairly modest game. On offense, Crystal Dunn started in place of Mallory Pugh, although Dunn did not have the impact that she did when she came on in the second half Wednesday, her debut as an Olympian. On defense, Whitney Engen replaced the injured Julie Johnston.Still not getting on the field was Megan Rapinoe, who has yet to play since ripping up her knee last December. Without her clever passing, the American attack was uninspiring. Alex Morgan and Morgan Brian had brief moments when it looked as if they were about to score, but neither put the ball in the net. But Lloyd did, and Solo did the rest, and the United States, which did not lose a game in last year\u2019s World Cup, has yet to lose one here, either.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Becomes a Green Energy Supplier, With Itself as Customer", "Date": "2016-08-23", "News": "Supported byPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 The words are stenciled on the front of the Apple Store, a glass box sandwiched between a nondescript Thai restaurant and a CVS pharmacy in downtown Palo Alto: \u201cThis store runs on 100 percent renewable energy.\u201dIf Apple\u2019s plans play out, it will be able to make that claim not only for its operations throughout California but also beyond, as the company aims to meet its growing needs for electricity with green sources like solar, wind and hydroelectric power.Like other big companies before it, including Walmart and Google, Apple recently received a federal designation for its energy subsidiary that allows it to become a wholesale seller of electricity from coast to coast. In effect, Apple is creating its own green utility company, although the main customer is itself.The motives may be economic as much as they are environmental. As a wholesaler, Apple could reduce the cost of its electricity load, which reached 831 million kilowatt-hours in the last fiscal year \u2014 enough to power about 76,000 homes for a year. But like a growing number of corporations, Apple is intent on reducing carbon dioxide emissions from electricity production \u2014 one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.In one ambitious venture, Apple has contracted with First Solar to begin buying a little less than half of the power later this year from California Flats, a solar energy farm now under construction. Under the terms of the deal, Apple will pay $848 million for the electricity over 25 years and receive the farm\u2019s total output by the end of the agreement. It is one of largest commercial clean energy contracts yet.Lisa Jackson, the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency who is now the Apple executive overseeing environmental policy, social initiatives and worldwide government affairs, said she hoped Apple could serve as a model for the many other big corporate power users that are now embracing clean energy.\u201cThis is just another sort of innovative way to get that power onto the grid so we don\u2019t have to take the California grid-mix default, which still includes fossil fuel,\u201d Ms. Jackson said.Although much of Apple\u2019s manufacturing is done offshore, it still has extensive needs for electric power in the United States \u2014 and not only for the sprawling new corporate campus it is building at its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., and its 270 retail stores around the country.One of Apple\u2019s biggest demands for electricity comes from operating the computing cloud through which it sells apps, music and videos to users of its iPhones, iPads and Mac computers.Apple\u2019s move comes as prices for renewable energy continue to plummet. And signing long-term contracts allows businesses to shield themselves from potentially higher, more volatile charges from a power company. Apple would not say how much it was paying for California Flats\u2019s energy, but Ms. Jackson said last year at a Wall Street Journal conference that it was less than what it paid for commercial power. She said she expected the company to save hundreds of millions of dollars over the life of the contract.Google, which received its federal energy wholesale designation from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 2010, is a big proponent of the approach Apple is now taking.\u201cRunning any kind of business, having predictability in terms of your operating costs can be very important,\u201d said Gary Demasi, director of operations for data center energy and location strategy at Google, which has been a leading investor in and user of clean energy. \u201cRenewable energy, from a cost perspective, is now competitive with other forms of energy, much more so than it was a few years ago.\u201dExecutives face greater pressure from shareholders and customers to show that they are doing their part to fight climate change. At the same time, corporate energy use has exploded, driven in many cases by the ravenous demands of the data cloud.\u201cWe are all becoming very large energy players, and this is a shift,\u201d said Brian Janous, director of energy strategy at Microsoft. \u201cEnergy is not something that Microsoft or Amazon or Google really ever had to think much about prior to the advent of the cloud.\u201dElectric utilities have begun to respond by creating products and services to meet the corporate demand for clean energy, said Letha Tawney, the World Resources Institute\u2019s director of utility innovation.One such product is a green tariff. It was pioneered in North Carolina by Duke Energy and is now under consideration in about a dozen states. It allows companies to designate that they are paying for a renewable energy supply.Another is a synthetic or virtual power purchase agreement, under which companies contract to buy the output of a clean power plant, as Apple is doing with California Flats.Although the companies say these arrangements mean they are running their businesses on renewable energy, in reality the clean power often does not flow directly to their facilities. They typically buy the renewable energy in amounts to match what they draw from the grid \u2014 a system of swaps that Ms. Jackson of Apple likened to using an A.T.M.\u201cThe dollar you deposit in the bank might not be the exact same bill that you get out,\u201d she said.Robert F. Shapiro, a partner at the law firm Chadbourne & Parke who focuses on project finance and energy, describes it as meaningful symbolism.\u201cThey\u2019re actually getting power from their local utility, which may be coal,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cBut they\u2019re deemed to have put into the world carbon-neutral energy, which they are deemed to have used for their load.\u201dTo keep track of the clean energy credits, power generators work with registries to issue numbered certificates.\u201cThe power flows into the grid. The electrons go where they go,\u201d Ms. Tawney said. \u201cBut because there\u2019s a renewable-energy certificate, no one else can claim the same zero-carbon benefit.\u201dSuch complexities are necessary, executives and clean energy advocates say, because it is not often feasible to install enough renewable-power generators at corporate sites to meet companies\u2019 full energy needs.Walmart, despite having installed solar panels, wind turbines and fuel cells at stores and distribution centers, can nonetheless meet only about a third of those operations\u2019 energy needs. So it also buys renewable energy from generators and utilities, said David Ozment, director of energy at Walmart stores.Procter & Gamble, another member of the energy buyers\u2019 alliance, has arranged to purchase all of the steam from a biomass generator under construction at a plant in Georgia where it makes Charmin toilet paper and Bounty paper towels, said Jack McAneny, the company\u2019s director of sustainability.But that was possible, he said, only because of the plant\u2019s location near a source of waste wood and pulp for fuel and the cooperation of P&G\u2019s partners. Among those partners are the local utility, Georgia Power, which will buy the electricity from the generator for its customers from Constellation, the company that developed and will own and operate the generator.At Apple, where the purchase or production of renewable energy has more than tripled since 2012, the company would prefer to not have to go to great lengths to ensure a clean energy supply, Ms. Jackson said. But the public energy grid is simply still too dependent on carbon-based fuels to make that possible.\u201cIf we had our preference, we\u2019d just be able to say, \u2018We want 100 percent green power everywhere we use power,\u2019\u201d Ms. Jackson said. \u201cThe best would be if we could run every one of our stores, every one of our data centers, every office complex, every building we have, on 100 percent renewable \u2014 and if we didn\u2019t have to spend a whole bunch of our time and energy figuring out how to get that done.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Secret to Cutting Spending: Wait 72 Hours Before You Buy", "Date": "2016-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySketch GuyI\u2019m going to assume for a minute that you\u2019re one of the millions of people who have a recurrently frustrating relationship with spending. It probably starts with a commitment to sticking to your budget, and you do for a few days. Then, despite your resolve, you break down, pull out the credit card and do something that you promised you wouldn\u2019t. You wake up in the morning ashamed and resolve never to do it again.Then you repeat.Been there? Done that?Frustrated, you wonder what\u2019s wrong. You\u2019re smart, you\u2019re successful, and when you set your mind to something, you\u2019re able to do it.I think we can all relate. If not money, insert food. So what can we do about this problem of knowing we should act one way but repeatedly doing something different?The answer lies in understanding the relationship between the stimulus to do something, how we respond and a little secret I\u2019ll share in a minute.But first, here\u2019s the problem as I see it: Almost all personal finance advice focuses on controlling the stimulus or your response to it. Gurus tell you to stop looking at Instagram, stay off Facebook, fire all your nonfrugal friends and disown your spendthrift family members. That is an effort to control the stimulus.Then, you\u2019re told to control your response. Most of this advice centers on making it painful to spend. Cut up your credit cards. Use only cash. Track, review and feel bad about your spending.It works until it doesn\u2019t anymore. You can\u2019t ignore all the voices screaming at you to spend, and making spending painful increases the feelings of shame when we do something wrong. It only leads to more spending as a form of self-medicating.Whoa! There is a third element to this little dance with stimulus and response. To break this frustrating spending cycle, we can focus on creating space between the two of them.It starts by acknowledging that the space exists. Most of us don\u2019t even know it\u2019s there. We see a Twitter post about a book someone likes, the post has a link to Amazon, we click the \u201cone click buy\u201d button, and then we own a book with little to no thought.So we need to practice pausing once we\u2019re in that space between. The advice to use cash or to lock up the credit cards can be useful here if it creates space between our desire to buy and our actual buying. It can also be as simple as training ourselves to notice the desire. How does it feel to want something?I didn\u2019t need to bar myself from reading book reviews or allow myself to buy books only with cash. By adding a little space, I gave myself the opportunity to change my response. How you add space is up to you, but once you get good at creating it, then some of the other things matter less.This is just one simple trick to create space. I think you\u2019ll find that by focusing on the space between, you can let go of your anxious grasp on the stimulus and response. If you get the space right, the other two take care of themselves.I\u2019d love to hear from you. What have you done to create space? How has it helped you?Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of an Austrian psychiatrist on second reference.

{"Headline": "Everyone Despises SolarCity Deal, Except Tesla Shareholders", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseCorporate governance experts are up in arms, because Tesla\u2019s visionary founder, the entrepreneur Elon Musk, also founded SolarCity and is the largest shareholder in both companies. SolarCity\u2019s chief executive is Mr. Musk\u2019s cousin. There are overlapping directors. Critics called it blatant self-dealing and accused Mr. Musk of using valuable Tesla shares to bail out a struggling SolarCity.James S. Chanos \u2014 an investor who, it should be noted, is betting against both stocks \u2014 called it a \u201cshameful example of corporate governance at its worst.\u201dBut what if the critics are wrong?Many auto industry experts also said the idea of combining Tesla, an electric-car manufacturer, with SolarCity, which makes solar energy panels, makes no strategic sense. Even if energy generation, storage and an auto powertrain are a seamless product, so-called vertical integration, in which one manufacturer makes all the components, was the old Henry Ford model and later, General Motors\u2019. That approach has gone down in automotive history as a colossal failure.Adam Jonas, the influential auto industry analyst at Morgan Stanley, slashed his price target for Tesla and wrote in a note to clients that potential rewards would not adequately compensate investors for the greater risks and cash flow drain. Expanding into a non-auto business like solar energy exposes Tesla to \u201cuntested cost, competitive and regulatory forces,\u201d he warned.Perhaps the harshest verdict came from the market itself: Tesla shares dropped more than 10 percent the day the deal was announced.Mr. Musk \u201cwent overnight from being a genius to an idiot,\u201d said Joseph Dennison, portfolio manager at Zevenbergen Capital Investments, a large Tesla shareholder.Largely overlooked in the din, however, is that few, if any, of Tesla\u2019s harshest critics are Tesla\u2019s current shareholders. And they are the only ones who truly matter, because they\u2019ll have a vote on the deal and it\u2019s their money on the line.Tesla\u2019s four biggest shareholders after Mr. Musk are mutual fund managers, including the industry giants Fidelity, Vanguard and T. Rowe Price. None have announced how they\u2019ll vote, but they have a history of supporting management generally, and specifically Mr. Musk.Even before the deal was announced, a Fidelity portfolio manager, Gavin Baker, told investors, \u201cWe are fans not just of Tesla products but of the concepts underpinning the firm and potential future partnerships ahead of it.\u201dRonald Baron, founder of Baron Capital, which owns 1.5 million Tesla shares, said his initial reaction was, \u201cWhy on earth would anyone want to do this? Can\u2019t you buy these panels much cheaper in China?\u201dHe said he had looked into investing in SolarCity several times, and each time decided to pass (a wise decision considering that SolarCity shares have fallen more than 50 percent this year.)But after further research and discussions with Tesla management, Mr. Baron told me his concerns had been largely assuaged. \u201cUntil I read the proxy, I can\u2019t tell you how I\u2019m going to vote,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the more we researched this, the more sense it made to combine Tesla with solar panels. We believe they can make better products, make them more efficiently, and realize tremendous savings by selling the two products together.\u201dOther investors have also been reconsidering the merits of the deal. Tesla shares have more than recovered what they lost after the deal was announced. And investors brushed off an announcement on Wednesday of worse-than-expected quarterly losses, focusing instead on higher vehicle production and new orders.Tesla tried to do its best to allay concerns about Mr. Musk\u2019s conflict of interest. Mr. Musk will not vote, nor will other insiders who own shares in both companies, a step that was not mandated by law.Tesla maintains that various committees of directors that it says are independent vigorously negotiated terms of the deal, and that Mr. Musk did not know the price before it was agreed on. When the deal became final on Monday, the price was slightly lower than that announced in June, suggesting some genuine haggling went on.But realistically, Mr. Musk\u2019s dominant role in both companies means that \u201cit\u2019s an intractable problem,\u201d said Charles M. Elson, an expert in corporate governance at the University of Delaware. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to resolve this. The only way would be not to do it.\u201dTesla says that would elevate corporate governance purity at the expense of common sense. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to take every appropriate step\u201d to minimize the conflict issues, Todd A. Maron, Tesla\u2019s general counsel, told me this week. \u201cBut if there are synergies, which there are, and we can make the best product under one company\u2019s ownership, and we can persuade the independent shareholders to support the deal, there shouldn\u2019t be a strict prohibition just because someone is on both sides.\u201dMr. Dennison of Zevenbergen Capital said that focusing on conflicts \u201cis missing the bigger picture.\u201d\u201cTo make these future products as good, integrated and efficient as possible,\u201d he added, \u201cyou need the two companies working together.\u201d He said his firm had not announced how it would vote, but he has typically sided with management.From Zip2 to OpenAI, a look at the entrepreneur\u2019s many companies.As for making its own batteries and solar panels and being vertically integrated, Tesla maintains it had little choice. \u201cTesla does not believe in vertical integration as an objective in and of itself,\u201d Mr. Maron said, but \u201cgoes down that path because there\u2019s no better option.\u201d Tesla has said its planned auto production volume would consume \u201ctoday\u2019s entire worldwide production of lithium ion batteries.\u201d\u201cCreate a smoothly integrated and beautiful solar-roof-with-battery product that just works, empowering the individual as their own utility, and then scale that throughout the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t do this well if Tesla and SolarCity are different companies, which is why we need to combine and break down the barriers inherent to being separate companies.\u201dAdmittedly, that\u2019s a long-term vision that has little to do with the latest quarterly earnings. If Tesla owners were plugging their cars into outlets with electricity from coal-fired power plants, there would not be much sustainability to get excited about.\u201cMusk\u2019s vision from Day 1 10 years ago was to accelerate sustainable energy, \u201c said Mr. Dennison. \u201cThat\u2019s a much bigger vision than building cars.\u201dAnd vision is what Tesla\u2019s shareholders are buying into, just as Amazon investors put their faith in Jeff Bezos. That\u2019s why, for all the controversy, the SolarCity deal will almost surely be approved by Tesla shareholders.\u201cIf you\u2019re investing in a Musk business, you\u2019re investing in something that hasn\u2019t happened yet, so it\u2019s risky,\u201d said Mr. Baron. \u201cBut I love the guy. He\u2019s totally focused. He\u2019s already accomplished what people said could never be done.\u201dMr. Dennison agreed. \u201cYou\u2019re investing in the people who make and execute decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is obviously tied to a bigger picture and a longer-term road map than most. But Tesla management has executed on all the goals they\u2019ve laid out. I\u2019d say this is an investment based on faith, but not blind faith.\u201dThe Common Sense column on Aug. 5, about the proposed merger of Tesla Motors and SolarCity, described SolarCity\u2019s product incorrectly. The company makes solar energy generating panels, not storage devices.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: In \u2018Hillbilly Elegy,\u2019 a Tough Love Analysis of the Poor Who Back Trump", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of The TimesAfter reading \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d you can easily understand why. This is a historically peculiar election cycle, boisterously disrupted by outsiders, one of whom found the perfect host body in the Republican Party and became its presidential nominee. An investigation of voter estrangement has never felt more urgent, and we\u2019re certainly not getting one from the lacquered chatterers on the boob tube.Now, along comes Mr. Vance, offering a compassionate, discerning sociological analysis of the white underclass that has helped drive the politics of rebellion, particularly the ascent of Donald J. Trump. Combining thoughtful inquiry with firsthand experience, Mr. Vance has inadvertently provided a civilized reference guide for an uncivilized election, and he\u2019s done so in a vocabulary intelligible to both Democrats and Republicans.Imagine that.On the checklist of modern privilege, Mr. Vance, 31, has the top four in the bag: He is white, male, straight and Protestant.But his profile is misleading. His people \u2014 hillbillies, rednecks, white trash, choose your epithet (or term of affection, depending on your point of view) \u2014 didn\u2019t step off the Mayflower and become part of America\u2019s ascendant class. \u201cPoverty is the family tradition,\u201d he writes. His ancestors and kin were sharecroppers, coal miners, machinists, millworkers \u2014 all low-paying, body-wearying occupations that over the years have vanished or offered diminished security.Mr. Vance was raised in Middletown, Ohio, a now-decaying steel town filled with Kentucky transplants, which at one point included his Mamaw and Papaw \u2014 in newscaster English, that\u2019s grandma and grandpa \u2014 who moved there shortly after World War II. Though the couple eventually managed to achieve the material comforts of a middle-class life (house, car), they brought their Appalachian values and habits with them. Some were wonderfully positive, like loyalty and love of country. But others, like a tendency toward violence and verbal abuse, were inimical to family life.Papaw was forever coming home drunk. Mamaw, \u201ca violent nondrunk,\u201d was forever tormenting him, whether by serving him artfully arranged plates of garbage for dinner or dousing him with gasoline. All this guerrilla warfare affected their children. Mr. Vance\u2019s mother was an empress of instability \u2014 violent, feckless, prone to hysteria. A long stint in rehab couldn\u2019t shake her addiction to prescription narcotics (she\u2019d later move on to heroin). She spun through more boyfriends than this reader could count and at least five husbands.The only reason Mr. Vance made it out in one piece is because his grandparents eventually reconciled, becoming his unofficial guardians. (He also spent a terrifically affirming four years in the Marines.) Mamaw was especially encouraging. She was tough as snakeskin, foul-mouthed as a mobster and filled with love. In a town where many children don\u2019t finish high school, she raised a grandson who managed to graduate from Ohio State University and Yale Law School, defying skyscraping odds.\u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d in my mind, divides into two components: the family stories Mr. Vance tells \u2014 most of which are no doubt better experienced on the page than they were in real life \u2014 and the questions he raises. Chief among them: How much should he hold his hillbilly kin responsible for their own misfortunes?In Mr. Vance\u2019s estimation, the answer is: a lot. Economic insecurity, he\u2019s convinced, accounts for only a small part of his community\u2019s problems; the much larger issue is hillbilly culture itself. Though proud of it in many ways, he\u2019s also convinced that it \u201cincreasingly encourages social decay instead of counteracting it.\u201dHis frustration with the nonworking white poor is especially acute. He recalls being a cashier at a Middletown grocery store and watching resentfully as his neighbors, who had creatively gamed the welfare system, jabbered on their cellphones as they were going through the checkout line.He could not afford a cellphone.\u201cPolitical scientists have spent millions of words trying to explain how Appalachia and the South went from staunchly Democratic to staunchly Republican in less than a generation,\u201d Mr. Vance writes. He suspects those cellphones have a lot to do with it. \u201cI could never understand why our lives felt like a struggle while those living off of government largess enjoyed trinkets that I only dreamed about.\u201dTime and again, Mr. Vance preaches a message of tough love and personal responsibility. He has no patience with an old acquaintance who told him he quit his job because he hated waking up early, only to take to Facebook to blame the \u201cObama economy.\u201d Or with a former co-worker at a tile warehouse who missed work once a week though his girlfriend was pregnant.The difference is that President Obama believes poverty, though it may have a cultural component, is largely a structural problem, one the government can play a large role in fixing. Mr. Vance, a conservative, takes a far dimmer view.Whether you agree with Mr. Vance or not, you must admire him for his head-on confrontation with a taboo subject. And he frames his critique generously, stipulating that it isn\u2019t laziness that\u2019s destroying hillbilly culture but what the psychologist Martin Seligman calls \u201clearned helplessness\u201d \u2014 the fatalistic belief, born of too much adversity, that nothing can be done to change your lot.What he\u2019s really writing about is despair.Never is Mr. Vance more aware of this pessimism and estrangement than when he leaves for Ohio State University. He\u2019s plumped with hope; his neighbors, left behind, feel its opposite. \u201cThere was something almost spiritual,\u201d he writes, \u201cabout the cynicism of the community at large.\u201dHis friends and relations are convinced that the media lies. That politicians lie. That the military, an institution they revere, is fighting two fruitless wars. Universities feel \u201crigged\u201d and inaccessible; job prospects are slim. For what purpose do you live under such circumstances? When the stanchions of your life have sunk into the muck?Mr. Vance doesn\u2019t have all the answers. But he\u2019s advancing the conversation.Hillbilly ElegyA Memoir of a Family and Culture in CrisisBy J. D. Vance264 pages. Harper. $27.99.Advertisement"}

Please.As one walks down the sidewalks in residential areas, shaded by mature trees and basking in the city\u2019s sunny, mild weather, it\u2019s not too hard to understand why homeowners are trying to keep Palo Alto small despite its reputation for giving birth to the world\u2019s next big thing.But as symbols go, it\u2019s hard to beat the paradox of bad cellphone reception in the cradle of cutting-edge technology.Brian Reid, a computer scientist and Palo Alto resident, blames \u201can unbelievable, fanatical fear of cell towers\u201d among Palo Alto residents for the somewhat spotty coverage, and he said heavy data usage compounded the problem.Mr. Reid, who lives four doors from the house of Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple who died in 2011, remembers the irony in 2007, a time of even worse cellphone coverage, when the iPhone was being introduced.

The relationships, subject matter and locations have all gotten a CTRL-ALT-DEL at the outset of each of the show\u2019s three 10-episode seasons.The series, which debuted in 2014 one week after the \u201cMad Men\u201d midseason finale, shared that show\u2019s time slot as well as its workplace vibe, enigmatic antihero (here, Lee Pace from \u201cPushing Daisies\u201d) and intricate engagement with historical events. The characters and stories on \u201cHalt\u201d are fictional but run alongside the early histories of companies like Hewlett-Packard, Apple and IBM, which was a major presence in each of the show\u2019s first two seasons.\u201cHalt and Catch Fire,\u201d a phrase that refers to a computer problem that necessitates a reboot, is appropriate for a show that has gone through a number of permutations: It began as a series about the emergence of personal computing, pivoted into one about the genesis of online communities, and is now moving from Texas to Silicon Valley to focus on the development of internet commerce.There\u2019s also a reboot behind the camera. The new season, which begins on Tuesday, Aug. 23, will be the first with Christopher Cantwell and Christopher C. Rogers as showrunners; they created the series and worked for two seasons under the showrunner Jonathan Lisco, who left to create this summer\u2019s TNT series \u201cAnimal Kingdom.\u201dOn a soundstage here in June, Mr. Rogers explained that the tech industry, even in the \u201980s, was in a state of constant change. \u201cThe industry was so much about failing fast, figuring out what went wrong and making a whole new thing out of it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting every year, because we\u2019re starting over in a sense, and at this point we have an emotional back story with these characters that we can bring to new scenarios.\u201dThe first season centered on a computer executive (Mr. Pace) and a hardware genius (Scoot McNairy) who hack the market-leading IBM computer and build a lighter, faster version called the Giant. They start a PC division from scratch at the electronics company where they work and bring the Giant to market with bravado, cunning and gamesmanship.\u201cSeason 1 was almost a corporate thriller that had a clandestine, fun, sexy, dark feeling to it,\u201d said Kerry Bish\u00e9, whose character, Donna Clark, evolved from a risk-averse Texas Instruments assistant to a reluctant entrepreneur. \u201cWe\u2019re a world away from that now.\u201dIn Season 2, Mr. Pace and Mr. McNairy\u2019s characters went their separate ways, and the focus shifted to the origin story of a fictional online community called Mutiny that was a precursor to dial-up services like CompuServe and AOL. Mackenzie Davis, whose Cameron Howe was a supporting character in the first season, and Ms. Bish\u00e9\u2019s Donna start Mutiny as an outlet for online games and spend the season figuring out whether games or chat rooms have the brighter future.The more fluid and collaborative approach that the women took with Mutiny was in pointed contrast to the schemes and power games that the men undertook in developing the Giant. It was a shift that many critics focused on when praising the second season, but one that Ms. Davis and Ms. Bish\u00e9 play down.Ms. Davis said the show has never emphasized the characters\u2019 gender. \u201cIt comes up, but the Chrises [Mr. Rogers and Mr. Cantwell] are more interested in what it\u2019s like for entrepreneurs and idealists and ambitious people to succeed greatly and to fail greatly rather than focusing on the fact that they\u2019re women.\u201dMs. Bish\u00e9 added, \u201cMackenzie and I are of the mind that we treat these characters as people first, and whatever conclusion an audience draws about them being women is almost incidental.\u201dThe new season follows Mutiny\u2019s expansion from a dial-up service, which had to lease server space, to a 100,000-user community with its own mainframe. And while it is set in 1986, the issues \u2014 online privacy, technology creeping into people\u2019s daily lives, even recreational marijuana use \u2014 are strikingly contemporary.\u201cI.P.O. culture and the way Silicon Valley is with money and the progression of women in power are certainly in the ether right now,\u201d Ms. Davis said.AMC\u2019s \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d which ended in 2013, grew over time as viewers found earlier seasons of the series on Netflix, caught up and came back to AMC for later seasons. Streaming services have created a new revenue stream for networks like AMC, but the idea that Netflix viewers would come back to AMC for new seasons of shows has not borne out.\u201cEven with the emergence of Netflix, Hulu and Amazon, season-to-season growth is a real rarity,\u201d said Joel Stillerman, president of original programming and development for AMC. \u201cThere is a tiny handful of shows launched in the era of streaming video that have had season-to-season growth. \u2018Breaking Bad\u2019 was perfectly timed to take advantage of the emergence of Netflix, but it has not worked out that having a show on Netflix leads to bigger ratings.\u201dHBO\u2019s \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d lampoons the arrogant grandeur of today\u2019s tech industry, and shows like USA\u2019s \u201cMr. Robot\u201d and Netflix\u2019s \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d examine the darker aspects of tech in our lives. But in continuing to reinvent itself, \u201cHalt and Catch Fire\u201d is a stripped-down exploration of those ideas that began in the 1980s.\u201cThere were major players in Silicon Valley by that time,\u201d Mr. Cantwell said. \u201cOur characters are coming into that as the new kids on the block. They think they can play in the big leagues now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Is Said to Owe Back Taxes to Irish Government", "Date": "2016-08-29", "News": "Supported byThe European Union\u2019s competition authorities are poised to announce a major tax ruling against Apple\u2019s tax dealings with the Irish government on Tuesday, a decision that will likely increase trans-Atlantic tension over how some of the world\u2019s largest companies pay taxes on their global operations.The ruling, expected to be announced early Tuesday in Brussels, will result in Apple having to pay back taxes to the Irish government, according to three people briefed on the decision who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The amount is anticipated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars, one of these people said.The decision is set to further stoke tensions between American officials and their European counterparts, with Europe claiming the right to oversee tax policies for companies like Apple and Amazon, among others, that have used complicated tax structures in nations like Ireland and Luxembourg to reduce the amount of corporate tax they pay in other countries.\u201cThis will be framed by the U.S. as Europe overreaching,\u201d said Edward Kleinbard, a professor at the University of Southern California\u2019s Gould School of Law and a former chief of staff to the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. \u201cThat overreaction will make it a lot more difficult to police companies\u2019 international tax structures.\u201dApple, Irish authorities and European competition authorities declined to comment. The tax decision was earlier reported by RTE, the Irish broadcaster.Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s top antitrust official, is expected to say on Tuesday that the Irish government gave Apple preferential treatment on its local tax arrangements. These deals, related to agreements from 1991 and 2007, gave Apple an unfair advantage over other companies, and broke Europe\u2019s so-called state-aid rules that forbid any government from providing unfair assistance to certain companies over others, she is expected to say.Ireland can appeal any judgment by suing in the Court of Justice of the European Union to stop any resulting penalty, and Apple could seek to support such an appeal. Such appeals are likely to take years.For Apple, the potential tax clawback would be a blow to the company\u2019s approximately 30 years of activity in Ireland, where it currently employs around 5,500 people, mostly in Cork, a city in the south of the country.The tech giant has repeatedly denied that it received unfair tax treatment from Irish authorities, saying that it complies with all tax laws wherever it operates. While Apple has a large operation in Ireland, the company said its main corporate tax liabilities remain within the United States where it is based and conducts the majority of its research and development.The European Commission has been seeking a greater say over tax issues for decades. Those efforts accelerated after the 2008 financial crisis amid complaints that prosperous corporations were enjoying tax breaks while citizens faced mounting tax demands and cuts to their public services.Ms. Vestager has already ordered Luxembourg to claw back 30 million euros, or $33 million, from Fiat, the Italian carmaker, and the Netherlands to recover a similar amount from Starbucks. Both Luxembourg and the Netherlands have appealed those decisions. She still is investigating similar cases in Luxembourg affecting Amazon and McDonald\u2019s.Last year, in another case, Ms. Vestager ordered France to recover \u20ac1.4 billion, or $1.6 billion, from state-controlled \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France for failing to pay enough corporation tax in 1997. At the time, E.D.F. said it would make the reimbursement but was considering an appeal to the Court of Justice of the European Union.\u201cOur aim is very simple,\u201d Ms. Vestager said in an interview earlier this year. \u201cProfits should be taxed where profits are made.\u201dThe European Union\u2019s investigation into the Irish treatment of Apple began under Ms. Vestager\u2019s predecessor, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia. It was prompted in part by a United States Senate investigation in 2013 that found that Apple, the world\u2019s largest public company by market capitalization, sheltered tens of billions of dollars in profit from tax in offshore entities including in Ireland. The European Commission opened a formal investigation in June 2014 into whether the tax deals granted to Apple in Ireland amounted to illegal state support.Ireland strongly objected to the investigation. The ruling is likely to be a hard pill to swallow for the country, which has spent decades championing its low corporate tax rate and other tax breaks to entice American companies to its shores.The Irish government has said that it will appeal any tax decision announced by European officials, putting the country in the somewhat odd position of turning down potentially billions of dollars of extra revenue from Apple.\u201cThe decision by the Irish government to fight this case is bizarre,\u201d said James Stewart, a professor at Trinity College, Dublin. \u201cThe Irish government is opposed to any global tax harmonization because it will harm its ability to attract foreign direct investment.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It wants the Alexa Voice Service, which powers Echo, to be an ingredient in devices around the home and beyond, even if they aren\u2019t made by Amazon.The vision of an omnipresent intelligent assistant is one Amazon shares, in one form or another, with most other big technology companies, including Apple, Google and Microsoft. Along with a handful of start-ups, these companies see their intelligent assistants as powerful new ways for users to interact with devices and internet services \u2014 just as smartphone touch screens were.Many technology specialists think that people will be O.K. with a single intelligent assistant in their lives but that most won\u2019t have the patience to regularly use two or three of them, each with its individual quirks. As a result, each company is racing to weave its assistant into as many devices and services as possible.\u201cWe\u2019re taking $180 worth of utility and adding it into a $200 device,\u201d he said.Ford Motor is working with Amazon to integrate Alexa into its vehicles so drivers can control smart-home features like lights, thermostats and security systems from their cars.Over 10,000 developers have registered to integrate Alexa into their products, Amazon said. It won\u2019t say how many Echo units it has sold, except to say that millions of devices with Alexa in them have been purchased.In an interview this spring, David Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for devices, said that the company wanted there to be as many Alexa-linked \u201cendpoints\u201d around the home as possible and that Amazon did not really care who made those devices. Amazon has expanded its lineup of devices that use Alexa with its Echo Dot, a miniature version of the Echo speaker, and Amazon Tap, a portable Bluetooth speaker.\u201cThe longer-term vision is a little bit like the \u2018Star Trek\u2019 computer,\u201d Mr. Limp said. \u201cCaptain Kirk or Picard could sit on the bridge and ask anything and get the right answer.\u201dBut while Amazon has made a lot of progress in this regard, it may have a hard time extending Alexa\u2019s reach outside the home because of its weaknesses in mobile technology, analysts say.The success of Echo has been described as a redemption of sorts for Amazon after it suffered a brutal defeat in the smartphone market with its Fire Phone, which the company stopped selling after poor sales \u2014 a misstep that has left Amazon vulnerable.Apple and Google have clear advantages over Amazon because of their dominant positions in the mobile market. And they are pushing their versions of Alexa \u2014 Siri and Google\u2019s assistant \u2014 as ways to control other devices throughout the home.As intelligent assistants improve in quality, Jan Dawson, an analyst at Jackdaw Research, thinks people will want these virtual helpers to follow them all day like a companion. \u201cWhat you want from an assistant is that they are always available to you everywhere,\u201d he said.While Amazon could eventually give people access to Alexa\u2019s functions through apps on smartphones (a couple of apps from independent developers do this already), Mr. Dawson is skeptical that Amazon will be able to make them work as well as assistants more deeply integrated into smartphones by Apple and Google.\u201cThey\u2019re basically absent on smartphones, which are devices we take everywhere we go,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Criticism\u2019s Sting: The Author Curtis Sittenfeld on Book Reviews", "Date": "2016-08-23", "News": "Supported byO.K., the obvious questions first: Do you read all your reviews?No. I read more of the early ones and more of the ones from publications I respect. I think of reviews being mapped on a graph with four quadrants, and I\u2019ll read the ones that are smart and positive, smart and negative, or dumb and positive (hey, all our egos need a little sustenance!). But there\u2019s no point in reading a dumb, negative review.You\u2019ve now written five books. Your feelings toward reviews must have evolved over the years, yes? I take criticism less personally, and I recognize that sometimes fate smiles on you and sometimes it doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m aware more than I was before I had books published that any review is a bit arbitrary \u2014 it\u2019s not really, say, The New York Times that\u2019s authoritatively weighing in on the quality of a book, though it seems this way to the public. It\u2019s actually one reviewer weighing in (maybe a daily reviewer like you, but maybe a random novelist like me who reviews one or two books a year), and all of us as individuals have quirky, subjective taste.When my first book, \u201cPrep,\u201d was published, I also realized I had to accept that many reviews would contain factual errors, and some would misunderstand the book. Unless you receive a rave, especially in The Times, it\u2019s tempting to write a letter to set the record straight, but I literally don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever read a letter from a writer complaining about his or her negative review that made the writer look good. You\u2019re better off just biting your tongue.Which review was the most hurtful, and how did you react to it? Reassuring, believe me.Which review was the most gratifying, and how did you react to that? Which one (if any) was the most helpful/constructive?When my second novel came out, I read a brief review on Amazon by a total stranger, and the person basically said, \u201cThis book is O.K., but Curtis Sittenfeld is capable of a lot more, and I wish she had challenged herself.\u201d This was like the kind version of The Times review I mentioned above, and its kindness made me feel both even more embarrassed but also a lot more inspired. After \u201cAmerican Wife\u201d came out \u2014 and \u201cA.W.\u201d was definitely a book where I had challenged myself \u2014 this same person posted a review that was something like: \u201cBravo, Curtis! I knew you could do it.\u201d I will always have an enormous soft spot in my heart for you, Random Anonymous Amazon Reviewer.Do you have a nightmare reviewer? You do not have to name this person, just curious if you do.The nightmare reviewer is the reviewer who has some sort of agenda that precludes him or her responding sincerely to the book. Often that agenda is seeming clever and/or taking someone who has received more than her fair share of attention down a notch. But again, there are people who are just on a different wavelength from you, and it\u2019s not that they misunderstand your book \u2014 it\u2019s that they really in their heart of hearts don\u2019t like it. That\u2019s actually fair.Do you like doing criticism yourself?My husband pointed out to me years ago that there\u2019s something strange about novelists\u2019 reviewing other novelists\u2019 books \u2014 we all have too much dog in the fight. And, say, Meryl Streep would never review another actress\u2019s performance. (Maybe one of the reasons I\u2019m married to my husband is that I get to be Meryl Streep in this analogy?) So, I consider writing reviews a professional minefield, and then an editor reaches out and asks if I\u2019d like to review a book that I really want to read, and because I am a nerdy writer, I find it fun to analyze books, to sort of take them apart and see what made them work or not work. Thus, against my better judgment, I say yes.What is the one thing that someone could say to you that would send you over the moon? Or under a desk?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why It\u2019s Not Enough Just to Be Disruptive", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "Supported byAnother ViewThe unanimous takeaway has been that incumbents everywhere are poised to get their clocks cleaned by a stampede of disruptive insurgents \u2014 unless they buy them first.This analysis, however, misdiagnoses recent transactions as a series of new-versus-old shootouts.To be sure, the web has been grinding down barriers to entry for 20 years, reducing the advantages of incumbents. For new entrants, this flatter playing field creates opportunity. But since the key tools at their disposal are universally available \u2014 including to companies like Facebook and Google, with enormous scale advantages \u2014 this only helps them get into the game, not capture any value lost by legacy firms. Short-term success may be driven by exceptional execution; long-term value creation requires building a defensible model.Any microeconomics textbook will tell you there are limited sources of competitive advantage. The most valuable companies combine several reinforcing strands, like scale and customer loyalty. Gillette has long been, literally, a textbook example.In 1996, Warren E. Buffett, then the largest shareholder in Gillette, commented: \u201cYou go to bed feeling very comfortable just thinking about two and a half billion males with hair growing while you sleep. No one at Gillette has trouble sleeping.\u201dBut 20 years later, management at Gillette (long since acquired by Procter & Gamble) is probably tossing and turning a little more. Gillette\u2019s scale still provides formidable advantages (wide retail distribution, superior patented technology through large R.&D. investment), and its well-known brand (reinforced through mass-media advertising) creates a strong habit in loyal customers acquired early in their lives.However, those advantages are plainly no longer as formidable as they were at the company\u2019s zenith. For an insurgent like Dollar Shave Club, online sales reduce the impact of Gillette\u2019s big lead in drugstore shelf space, and cloud-computing services reduce the required upfront technology investment. Targeted direct marketing on Facebook and other social channels obviates the need for a mass-media campaign, while customer reviews and word-of-mouth can spread the word. At the high end, Gillette\u2019s patented, multi-blade, vibrating razor is a tough opponent, so naturally new entrants focus on the entry level \u2014 where they can rebrand cheap, no-name blades to compete.In Jet\u2019s case, the serial entrepreneur Marc Lore was able to build a large e-commerce company for a few hundred million dollars in just a couple of years by taking an innovative approach to pricing and distribution. And Walmart is plainly convinced that Jet\u2019s expertise and momentum will help it compete with Amazon. Jet\u2019s negative gross margins, which would have required large continuing investments, will disappear when combined with Walmart\u2019s purchasing and distribution scale.While it is hard to stay ahead solely through superior execution over an extended period, it is sometimes enough in the short term to draw a deep-pocketed buyer where there are strong, immediate synergies. Creating enormous value over the long term requires turning a tactical edge into some form of durable advantage.While there are plenty of extraordinary start-ups creating new markets with a path to genuine advantage, self-described \u201cdisrupters\u201d often find that the same forces that allowed them to get going initially also let in a horde of rivals. Competition drains away profit.This is particularly likely where the \u201cdisruptive innovation\u201d does not greatly change the cost structure or end-user experience. Putting a thin layer of software on a people-intensive service business, for instance, may win some immediate sales against Luddite competitors, but it is not necessarily sustainable, nor will it conjure up fat margins. New and existing competitors can often spiff up their supporting tech, too.As the Columbia Business School Professor Bruce C. Greenwald pointed out in his book \u201cCompetition Demystified,\u201d product differentiation on its own is not the basis for sustainable advantage. In his renowned example, \u201calmost everybody makes toasters\u201d \u2014 and if consumers one day demanded \u201ctoasters that sing when the bread is ready\u201d \u2014 soon every manufacturer would offer a \u201ccrooning toaster.\u201dThe rise of web-fueled competition is plainly inexorable. Computers are infinitely patient and accurate in comparing prices and opportunities, and now companies can provide a complete set of services to atomize the fixed costs formerly required for market entry.However, despite the threat to profits, there is no cause for gloom. Superior tactical execution can still create real value, particularly where it provides ammunition for a bigger war (like Walmart\u2019s battle with Amazon). And in the long term, value is created not by disruption, but by weaving together advantages (as both Amazon and Walmart have done in different ways) that together create a barrier that is hard to storm.Jeremy G. Philips is a general partner at Spark Capital and an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School.Advertisement"}

Don\u2019t Count on It", "Date": "2016-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixWHAT do subscriptions to a newspaper, magazine or Netflix account have in common? Once you sign up, you expect to pay the same rate every month.I learned this the hard way while reviewing an email summary of my Amazon subscriptions. A pack of lint rollers that I had subscribed to for more than two years recently jumped to $18.04 a pack, up from $12.44 since the last delivery a few months ago, or almost a 50 percent increase.Amazon declined to comment. The company emails people 10 days before a recurring subscription delivery, when it informs customers of a new price of their item so they can change or skip the order.Any sticker shock, analysts said, may be the result of Amazon\u2019s complex pricing system coming into conflict with consumer expectations of a traditional subscription.Jared Wiesel, a partner at Revenue Analytics, a pricing and sales consulting firm, said of Amazon, \u201cI think they\u2019ve violated the psychological concept of a subscription with their customers in changing prices like this. When people think of a subscription, they think of locking in a set cadence of receiving a good.\u201dAmazon\u2019s dynamic pricing system, in which it frequently adjusts item prices based on a sophisticated set of variables like supply and demand, time of day and prices offered by competitors, is the company\u2019s way of making it look as if you are always getting the best deal, Mr. Wiesel said.Prices of goods can also fall, of course. But even when prices decline, people need to beware because Amazon\u2019s pricing tends to fluctuate more widely and more frequently than at your local grocery store or Walmart, Mr. Wiesel added. In traditional retail, the major price changes typically happen during promotions, he said.Prices of most items, including dishwasher soap and toilet bowl cleaner, changed frequently. As often as weekly, prices rose, dipped and rose again like a roller coaster. In extreme cases, prices for items like instant coffee and napkins jumped between 90 and 170 percent. (Prices below reflect subscription discounts.)\u2022 Folgers Coffee, 30.5-Ounce Tub\u2022 Vanity Fair Napkins______Only five of the Subscribe & Save items held steady.\u2022 Sparkle Paper Towels\u2022 Death Wish CoffeeAfter the service\u2019s 5 percent discount, the paper towels cost $24.69 and the coffee cost $18.99. Not bad.______In the end, whether you save money depends on when your subscription order is placed and what items you buy. The downside of buying through Amazon\u2019s subscription program is the lack of predictability, Mr. Wiesel said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen this type of price fluctuation in a brick-and-mortar store,\u201d he added. Some highlights over the last six months (with subscription discounts applied):\u2022 GermGuardian Air Purifier Replacement Filter\u2022 Honeywell Humidifier Replacement Filter\u2022 Lysol Disinfecting Wipes (3-Pack)______Mr. Wiesel noted that it would be tough for Amazon to revise its subscription program to offer items at fixed rates. A majority of sales on Amazon are one-time purchases, and dynamic pricing is fundamental to how the company operates. If, for example, Subscribe & Save prices remained static, those customers could miss out when prices go down for one-time purchases of the same products.If you truly want to save money on Amazon, one approach is to sign up for price alerts on Camel Camel Camel to get an email when a price drops to a desired amount. When that happens, manually reorder \u2014 yes, that\u2019s an extra step \u2014 your instant coffee, toilet cleaner or lint rollers.Sucharita Mulpuru-Kodali, an analyst for Forrester Research who follows Amazon, said the retailer was probably pushing prices up to test how loyal customers are to products and how much more they are willing to pay for them. Yet the sharp price changes on Subscribe & Save items caught her by surprise.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem as customer-friendly as Amazon typically is,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s unusual.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Pandora, the internet radio giant, was one of several digital music outlets then trying to curry favor with him, Questlove said.\u201cI went in there to talk about playlists, and I ended up with a job as an equity partner,\u201d Questlove, whose real name is Ahmir Thompson, said in an interview.For Pandora, which has clashed with the music industry in the past, the involvement of an authority like Questlove \u2014 whose group is the house band on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d \u2014 is an important endorsement as the company embarks on its biggest challenge yet: expanding its service beyond radio to compete directly with Spotify, Apple Music and Tidal.\u201cWe are entering into a new phase for the company,\u201d Mr. Westergren said. \u201cWe are working more directly with labels and artists. We really want to invest a lot in that nexus, and having someone like him bridge that and speak on our behalf is really powerful.\u201dPandora, which began in 2005 and went public in 2011, has long been the most popular internet radio service, and it is one of a handful of digital music brands that have become household names. But its growth has slowed as it has faced more pressure from streaming competitors. Pandora\u2019s number of average monthly listeners reached its peak at the end of 2014, at 81.5 million.\u201cPandora is in a difficult chapter,\u201d said Mark Mulligan, a digital media analyst with Midia Research. \u201cWall Street doesn\u2019t like mature growth stories in young tech companies.

In its earlier days, Pandora stayed largely independent of the music industry, relying on statutory licensing processes rather than dealing with record labels, which has sometimes resulted in ill will over royalties. Last year, Pandora reported that it paid $610 million, or about 52 percent of its revenue, in royalties and related costs.These days, Pandora is eager to promote the marketing platforms it makes available to artists, such as audio messages that can be delivered to fans and detailed data about the popularity of particular songs.

Since then, he\u2019s been bouncing among friends\u2019 apartments and Airbnb rentals.Mr. Altucher is simply practicing what he preaches. Over the last half-decade, this former tech entrepreneur, venture capitalist and financial pundit has reinvented himself as a gimlet-eyed self-help guru, preaching survival in an era when the American Dream \u2014 the gold-embossed college diploma, the corner office, the three-bedroom home \u2014 seems like a sham. So one by one, he has shed all of them.\u201cI have ambition,\u201d he said, \u201cto have no ambition.\u201d\u201cIn the past 25 years, income has gone down for the 18-to-35-year-olds, student loan debt is at an all-time high,\u201d Mr. Altucher said over a lunch of zucchini pancakes at a Russian restaurant in the Flatiron district. \u201cWe had $3 trillion in bailout money, and income inequality got higher than ever. People feel like they were scammed.\u201dMr. Altucher\u2019s diagnosis will come as no surprise to the anxious middle class, the downsized and the dispossessed who have propelled the angry populism of Bernie Sanders and Donald J. Trump.But while there is no shortage of anger and confusion about the supposed waning of the American Dream, what makes Mr. Altucher stand out are his Cassandra-like conclusions.Similarly, he believes homeownership is a rip-off foisted upon unwitting citizens by a $14 trillion mortgage industry.And he think stocks are a racket. It\u2019s a fierce worldview that is rooted in Mr. Altucher\u2019s own roller-coaster life.In the 1990s, as a young Silicon Alley start-up whiz, Mr. Altucher made millions with a web-design company, Reset Inc., that counted Sony and Miramax as clients.Soon, he and his wife at the time, Anne (they divorced in 2010), were living in a 5,000-square-foot loft in TriBeCa that he bought for $1.8 million and spent another $1 million renovating. He felt flush enough to take a helicopter to Atlantic City on weekends to play poker.The lavish lifestyle did not fill his emotional void. \u201cNobody should feel sorry for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI was really stupid, but I thought I was dirt poor. I felt like I needed $100 million to be happy. So I just started investing in all these other companies, and they were just stupid companies. Zero of these investments worked out.\u201dAs his fortunes collapsed, he was forced to sell his apartment for a $1 million loss (it was after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001).\u201cFinancial people were like watching a train wreck in real time,\u201d Mr. Altucher said. \u201cI had friends I hadn\u2019t talked to since high school call me and say, \u2018Hey, are you O.K.?\u2019\u201dHe soon discovered a sizable audience of people whose own dreams had just gone down the sinkhole. They, too, were looking to claw their way out.\u201cThe No. 1 search phrase on Google that takes people to my blog is \u2018I want to die,\u2019\u201d Mr. Altucher said.But Mr. Altucher seems like an unlikely person to look to for solace. Bookish, contrarian and given to speaking in staccato bursts, this skinny computer geek from North Brunswick, N.J., is like the anti-Anthony Robbins, the strapping self-help star.His regular-guy appearance turned out to be a plus, as he developed a following blogging about his win-some-lose-some \u201clife hacker\u201d experiments.It helped that Mr. Altucher, despite his biting views on topics like college, maintained a positive tone. \u201cI am an optimist,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a great novel from the \u201860s by Richard Fari\u00f1a called \u2018Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me.\u2019 Basically, I\u2019ve been down on the floor so many times, I know now that I can always bounce back, and it gets faster each time.\u201dHis philosophy is perhaps most clearly articulated in \u201cChoose Yourself,\u201d which he summarized over lunch like this: \u201cIf you don\u2019t choose the life you want to live, chances are, someone else is going to choose it for you. And the results are probably not going to be pretty.\u201dChapters include \u201cHow to Be Less Stupid\u201d (\u201cI lose at least 20 percent of my intelligence when I am resentful\u201d) and \u201cThe Seven Habits of Highly Effective Mediocre People\u201d (procrastination, he writes, \u201cis your body telling you that you need to back off a bit and think more about what you are doing\u201d).He calls them the four pillars of happiness. \u201cA chair needs four legs to be stable,\u201d he said.And there has never been a better time to choose yourself, he said.He would know. \u201cChoose Yourself,\u201d which Mr. Altucher self-published on Amazon, sold more than a half-million copies, he said, and made The Wall Street Journal\u2019s best-seller list.Mr. Altucher, in fact, disputes that he is a guru in the first place. \u201cI am not a self-help guy at all,\u201d he said.\u201cAdvice is autobiography,\u201d he added. \u201cI only say what has worked for me, and then others can choose to try it or not.\u201dBesides, what worked yesterday may not work tomorrow.\u201cIt\u2019s like Mike Tyson says,\u201d Mr. Altucher said. \u201c\u2018Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.\u2019\u201dAn article on Aug. 7 about the self-help guru James Altucher misstated the name of a website where people may learn basic web development.

{"Headline": "Oracle, Having Bet Billions on Its Future, Sets Sights on Data Analysis", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsOracle Corporation may well be the single most important technology firm for businesses. Over 300,000 companies around the world use its database, and 100,000 customers have purchased its business applications. Even companies gunning for Oracle \u2014 like Amazon, Google and Salesforce \u2014 have used Oracle\u2019s technology.Besides selling applications more efficiently, he said, Oracle has pooled a large amount of information derived from over 1,500 data providers. \u201cMarketers and brands find this very powerful,\u201d he said in an email, as Oracle targets \u201cover 45,000 different dimensions (demographic, geography, online and offline behavior).\u201dIn other words, what Google and Facebook know based on your online life, as well as what companies learn from your shopping habits, credit and warranty behavior, among other things. Oracle will also have data on what customers do after an ad campaign, so advertisers can check the outcome of a Google ad blitz.The same data-heavy approach can be used in functions of business like procurement, human capital management, sales and service, Mr. Kurian thinks. \u201cWe know how payrolls change around job titles, the rate of salary changes in Silicon Valley versus Bangalore, or how many people in a company are buying a $10 printer cartridge,\u201d he told me in an earlier interview.This data analysis could become a valuable adjunct to many of Oracle\u2019s database and applications businesses. Equally, it drives home how the competition in cloud computing is moving from cost savings \u2014 Amazon Web Services started by selling cheap computing and storage \u2014 to value creation through better insight.In that business, large amounts of data are a critical asset \u2014 what Mr. Kurian termed \u201ctrying to be at the center of data gravity.\u201d Oracle definitely has a place there, perhaps a better one than any company.Other elements of success will most likely include reliability, ease of use and price. Oracle may be challenged there, precisely because it has built a big and complicated system of databases, bigger than anything Amazon, Microsoft or Google sells. It has to keep those older customers happy, even as it makes data easier to move around, in and out of the cloud, for different kinds of analysis.In that, Oracle has a powerful and little-noted asset: Despite its reputation as a hard-edge company, it has good engineers with decades of experience. Employees fly in and out of Google or Facebook, but they seem to stay longer, on average, at Oracle.That can be an advantage when it comes to working on complex projects. \u201cUnderstanding complex software takes a year,\u201d Mr. Kurian said. \u201cUnderstanding the intentions behind it, which you need if you\u2019re going to adapt it, takes even longer.\u201dSlow, steady and reliable may make people at the fast, young tech companies snicker.

{"Headline": "G.E., the 124-Year-Old Software Start-Up", "Date": "2016-08-27", "News": "Supported byIt may not qualify as a lightning-bolt eureka moment, but Jeffrey R. Immelt, chief executive of General Electric, recalls the June day in 2009 that got him thinking. He was speaking with G.E. scientists about new jet engines they were building, laden with sensors to generate a trove of data from every flight \u2014 but to what end?That data could someday be as valuable as the machinery itself, if not more so. But G.E. couldn\u2019t make use of it.But in 2011, G.E. also quietly opened a software center in San Ramon, Calif., 24 miles east of San Francisco, across the bay.Today one of San Ramon\u2019s most important projects is to build a computer operating system, but on an industrial scale \u2014 a Microsoft Windows or Google Android for factories and industrial equipment. The project is central to G.E.\u2019s drive to become what Mr. Immelt says will be a \u201ctop 10 software company\u201d by 2020.Silicon Valley veterans are skeptical.Many industries see digital threats, of course. Yet the scope of the challenge is magnified at G.E., a 124-year-old company and the nation\u2019s largest manufacturer, with more than 300,000 employees worldwide. Employees companywide have been making pilgrimages to San Ramon for technology briefings, but also to soak in the culture. Their marching orders are to try to adapt the digital wizardry and hurry-up habits of Silicon Valley to G.E.\u2019s world of industrial manufacturing.6 PhotosG.E.\u2019s success or failure over the next decade, Mr. Immelt says, depends on this transformation. He calls it \u201cprobably the most important thing I\u2019ve worked on in my career.\u201dApparently, there is no Plan B. \u201cIt\u2019s this or bust,\u201d he said.The march of digital technology \u2014 mainly inexpensive sensors, powerful computing and clever software \u2014 into the industrial world has been underway for years under the guise of \u201cthe internet of things\u201d or \u201cthe industrial internet.\u201d It is the next battlefield as companies fight to develop the dominant software layer that connects the machines.It promises to be a huge market for new products, improved service and efficiency gains in industries like energy, transportation and health care. By 2020, the industrial internet market will reach $225 billion, G.E. executives predicted in a recent meeting with analysts.So far, a major application has been predictive maintenance. Software analyzes the data generated by a machine to identify early warning signals that it needs repair, before it breaks down.The data volumes are exploding as machines new and old spawn sensors. By 2020, G.E. estimates that the data flowing off its machines in use will jump a hundredfold. That should enable far more detailed analysis, giving G.E. a chance to sell its customers not machines but \u201cbusiness outcomes,\u201d like fuel savings. Mr. Immelt sees this as a move up the industrial food chain.Yet all of this exposes G.E. to new competition beyond its traditional rivals like Rockwell Automation, Siemens and United Technologies. Tech giants, including Amazon, Cisco, Google, IBM and Microsoft also have their eye on the industrial internet market, as do a bevy of start-ups.There is precedent for trouble in other industries, of course. Google and Facebook transformed media and advertising, Amazon redefined retailing, and Uber applied an entirely new business model to taxis, which hadn\u2019t changed much in generations.\u201cThe real danger is that the data and analysis becomes worth more than the installed equipment itself,\u201d said Karim R. Lakhani, a professor at the Harvard Business School. \u201cG.E. has no choice but to try to do that itself.\u201dUntil this year, Darren Haas hadn\u2019t thought about G.E., certainly not working there. To him, G.E. meant little more than than kitchen appliances and light bulbs. \u201cI had no idea,\u201d Mr. Haas said.But he was intrigued after he met with Harel Kodesh, an expert in mobile and cloud computing who led teams at Microsoft and VMware, a maker of data-center software. Less than two years ago, Mr. Kodesh joined G.E., and he is now chief technology officer of GE Digital.That someone of Mr. Kodesh\u2019s caliber was a G.E. convert got Mr. Haas\u2019s attention. Then, Mr. Haas started grasping the role that G.E. equipment plays across the economy \u2014 in transportation, in hospitals \u2014 \u201ca whole world,\u201d he said. \u201cI found that really, really compelling.\u201dThe other thing Mr. Haas, 41, found appealing was the big computing challenge that lies ahead for the company. In May, he joined G.E. from Apple, where he was a member of the founding team at Siri, the voice-based digital assistant start-up Apple acquired in 2010. When he left Apple, Mr. Haas was head of cloud engineering, managing the computing engine behind Siri, iTunes and iCloud.At GE Digital, Mr. Haas has a similar title, head of platform cloud engineering, but in a different setting. He describes his job as applying modern software technology \u2014 machine learning, artificial intelligence and cloud computing \u2014 to the industrial arena. \u201cI\u2019ve got my work cut out for me,\u201d he said.Mr. Haas is working on the centerpiece of G.E.\u2019s software strategy, a product called Predix. Its evolution mirrors G.E.\u2019s software ambitions.Predix began as little more than a brand of software used by G.E. to service the gear it sells. One showcase use was in jet engines to do predictive maintenance, saving downtime. Around 2013, William Ruh, a former Cisco Systems executive brought in to put together the San Ramon software center, started expanding Predix to other G.E. industrial businesses.But that soon felt too small. The issue was \u201coutside disrupters,\u201d Mr. Ruh said, citing the online lodging start-up Airbnb as an example of rivals that can appear seemingly out of nowhere and that \u201cbring greater productivity \u2014 but don\u2019t own the assets they sell.\u201d G.E., Mr. Ruh notes, is the ultimate big-asset company.The other threat was rising interest among tech companies to take their internet connectivity expertise and try to apply it to industrial businesses. To get ahead of all this, G.E. reimagined Predix as a cloud-based operating system for industrial applications.Mr. Kodesh leads that effort. He ticks off the looming competitors: Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and others. \u201cThose companies are going to encroach on the territory,\u201d Mr. Kodesh said. \u201cAre we going to capitulate, or build something like Predix?\u201dThe basic idea is that G.E. and outside software developers will write programs to run on Predix. This software might, for instance, monitor the health and fine-tune the operation of equipment like oil-field rigs and wind-farm turbines, improving performance, reducing wear and adapting to changing environmental conditions. It amounts to software delivering the equivalent of personalized medicine for machines.Like any other computer operating system, Predix aims to take the complexity out of writing programs, so more people can create them. And while the instincts of the industrial world are proprietary, G.E. is following an open-source model with Predix, providing a basic design, but one open to outside contributors \u2014 more like Android from Google than Windows from Microsoft.Predix, Mr. Kodesh said, will be improved using the software equivalent of Lego blocks. \u201cSome will be G.E.\u2019s, and some will be made by third-party developers,\u201d he said.G.E. is betting that its deep knowledge of industry will give it an edge in this software arms race. The stakes for this kind of programming can be high.For a regular consumer using the internet, a misfiring algorithm in the software \u2014 \u201ca false positive\u201d \u2014 might mean a person sees an irrelevant online ad, or a bad Amazon book suggestion or Netflix movie recommendation, Mr. Kodesh said. Useless, perhaps, but not necessarily costly. But a false positive that prompts an airline to take a jet engine off the wing, Mr. Kodesh said, is a $100,000 mistake.\u201cWe really do need to have different technology, different algorithms and a different cloud, than in the consumer internet,\u201d he said.G.E. has set an ambitious target for Predix. It hopes to attract $100 million in orders this year, on its way to $4 billion in revenue by 2020. By then, the company forecasts that its total digital business \u2014 more than 90 percent of it software \u2014 may reach as much as $15 billion, up from $6 billion now.For Predix to reach its potential, though, G.E. needs outside programmers to write software for it. The company, with its deep pockets, can start the software-writing parade, but will others follow?This will be a major test. And G.E.\u2019s campaign to build an industrial operating system and create a flourishing ecosystem of software for it is just getting underway in earnest.In late July, G.E. hosted a Predix conference in Las Vegas, which attracted 1,200 software developers. Such developer gatherings are part of the playbook of every major software company but unusual for an industrial corporation.G.E. has some built-in advantages. Its installed base is huge. For example, the company says more than a third of the world\u2019s electricity is generated on G.E. equipment. It can make progress simply by winning over the aircraft makers, oil companies, hospitals and utilities that now depend on G.E. machinery.G.E. is starting to attract a developer following. Tata Consultancy Services, for one, says it now has 500 programmers designing and developing Predix applications for customers in the electric-utility, aviation and health care industries. G.E. also promotes partnerships with Infosys, Wipro and Capgemini to help business write Predix software.When he joined in 2011, Mr. Ruh had no illusions that making software a strength at a heavy-industry company would be easy. At the time, he told Mr. Immelt that would be \u201ca 10-year journey,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of that journey.\u201dPart of that is an effort to change an engineering culture that stretches back generations. \u201cIf G.E. is truly going to be a digital-industrial company, we can\u2019t be separate here,\u201d Mr. Ruh said of his software division. Digital \u201ctools and habits\u201d need to be embedded \u201cin how people do their jobs,\u201d he said.In its factory in Greenville, S.C., G.E. produces both giant power generators and evidence that this metamorphosis might work.The three-story building is crowded with immense cranes and milling, grinding and welding machines, overseen by manufacturing engineers and technicians. The finishing touches are being put on one of G.E.\u2019s new gas turbines.It looks like the business end of a rocket ship lying on its side, a gleaming steel dynamo at rest. It weighs 950,000 pounds. It fires up at nearly 2,900 degrees Fahrenheit, and it can generate enough electricity to supply more than 500,000 households.The gas turbine was brought to market in half the typical five years. That kind of accelerated product development is a performance that G.E. hopes to replicate across its industrial businesses. And it is a story of changes in design and manufacturing practices made possible by digital technology.John Lammas, the 56-year-old vice president for power generation engineering, started his working career 40 years ago, on the shop floor of a Rolls-Royce jet engine factory in Birmingham, England. He has been with G.E. for 31 years, moving up the ranks of the company\u2019s jet engine and power turbine divisions.\u201cI\u2019m an old mechanical guy,\u201d he said. But a couple of years ago, he issued an edict: no more paper drawings.In the past, a model of a new part would be made and then converted to detailed blueprints running to 70 pages or more. These would then be physically sent to G.E. manufacturing engineers and outside suppliers to begin setting up the tooling, casting and cutting for the part.This prototype-and-blueprint routine took up to eight weeks. Now, engineers use 3-D computer models, skip the prototype step and instantly send the models electronically.This goes a step beyond computer-aided design, which is commonplace. In Greenville, the designers are for the first time linked directly with manufacturers and suppliers in real time, in what G.E. calls a \u201cdigital thread.\u201d This means they can collaborate in ways that have changed the work process while making it more likely that problems or defects are spotted sooner.Traditionally, one set of engineers designed a part, and only then passed it on to manufacturing. If a problem arose on the supplier side, the design was kicked back and the process started over. \u201cJobs are combining in this digital world,\u201d Mr. Lammas said.Greenville\u2019s own equipment has been a Predix guinea pig. The machinery and factory were retrofitted with data-generating sensors and the software. Matt Krause, the plant manager, said that last winter, when a snowstorm shut the factory for a day, the sensor network detected that the plant had consumed 1,000 pounds of argon, an inert gas used in coatings for parts. The leak was fixed, saving $350,000 a year.\u201cWe can see things we never did before,\u201d Mr. Krause said. Over all, 60 of 200 steps in design and production have been automated or eliminated, reducing work time by 530,000 hours over three years, G.E. estimates.Not all the start-up ideas that G.E. is trying to breed translate comfortably to heavy industry. Lean proponents urge companies to come up with \u201cminimum viable products,\u201d particularly test versions of software programs. But no one wants a minimum viable jet engine or power generator.Yet in Greenville, engineers in the design stages are encouraged to move faster in smaller steps, conduct more experiments, and be willing to fail and try again. It amounts to a sea change in the engineering culture of heavy industry.\u201cAs an engineer, not getting it right the first time, I find painful,\u201d said Bill Byrne, an engineering manager. \u201cIt\u2019s uncomfortable. But it\u2019s been incredibly liberating.\u201dThe old ways, said Mr. Lammas, the engineering chief, had merit. Each step and rule was logical on its own. But the emphasis on flawless execution and perfection fostered a fear of failure. \u201cOvercoming that culture was probably the biggest challenge,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Ellison, Oracle\u2019s brash executive chairman, is still an outsize personality at the company he co-founded, Mr. Kurian has been the key figure in Oracle\u2019s attempted reinvention, overseeing sweeping changes in its engineering. That includes the creation of a network of 21 data centers around the world, a project that has cost perhaps $15 billion. NetSuite is Oracle\u2019s first major acquisition intended to tie right into this new global system.\u201cMoney isn\u2019t the problem for us,\u201d said Mr. Kurian, who is Oracle\u2019s president of product development. He added that \u201cbetween 2004 and 2014 we spent some $40 billion to $45 billion on acquisitions.\u201dOracle became a giant by selling directly to businesses software packages that do things like manage the books and keep track of customers.

{"Headline": "Chip Technology Keeps Checked Luggage in Check", "Date": "2016-08-21", "News": "Supported byItinerariesOn a recent Southwest Airlines flight from Baltimore, Shvilla Rasheem arrived in Indianapolis, but her luggage did not.Ms. Rasheem, a 34-year-old consultant, said she always checks her bag when flying on Southwest because there is no fee. \u201cI never thought of the possibility that I would not get my luggage,\u201d she said.She had good reason not to worry. Statistics compiled by Sita, an aviation technology company, show a steadily decreasing likelihood of bags going astray.Last year had the lowest rate of wayward luggage \u2014 6.5 bags per 1,000 \u2014 in the dozen years Sita has been keeping track.Various advances in technology and bag-handling procedures deserve credit, including improvements over the years in the bar-coded tags and optical scanners that have long been in use for identifying and sorting checked luggage. But optical-scanning systems have their limits, and the airline industry has been slow to adopt methods used by other industries that need to track items through the shipping process.Where bar-coded tags fall short is if the tag is wrinkled, smudged or torn, or not in line of sight of the scanner. If the tag is not readable, the bag can get lost without being noticed \u2014 which could be why no one was aware that Ms. Rasheem\u2019s bag did not get loaded onto her flight.Bar code readers have a \u201cread rate\u201d of 80 to 95 percent of baggage tags, according to Nick Gates, a director at Sita responsible for baggage technology. \u201cIf you can improve the read rate of bag tags,\u201d Mr. Gates said, \u201cthere is less chance the bag will be delayed as it moves through the airport.\u201dThat is why the airline industry and some airport managers are intent on improving the tracking rate by looking beyond the 30-year-old baggage bar code. They are adopting tags that do not need to be seen to be read.Delta Air Lines has installed a system using bar-code tags that also have an embedded radio frequency identification, or R.F.I.D., chip. Such chips can store travel information and need to be only close to radio scanners along the way for the bag\u2019s progress to be recorded. As with Delta\u2019s older barcode tags, fliers will be able to use the airline\u2019s travel app to keep track of their bags.\u201cThis is the next step in reliability,\u201d said Rodney Brooks, general manager of airport operations at Delta.Air France, the German airline Lufthansa and Qantas of Australia are among those that have experimented with radio chip luggage tags. But adoption has lagged at airlines in the United States \u2014 which could change, with Delta\u2019s decision.The airline is spending $50 million on the necessary scanners, printers and radio tags, which also use bar codes and look little different from conventional bar-code tags. The system is now in place at all of the 344 airports into which Delta flies and is expected to be operational by the end of this month.Though still fairly novel in airline applications, R.F.I.D. technology is hardly new. It has been used for decades to keep track of shipments of merchandise, which is why many people wonder why it has not already been adopted by airlines, said Ryan Ghee, editor of FutureTravelExperience.com.\u201cLook at online retailing like Amazon and the logistics industry,\u201d Mr. Ghee said. \u201cPeople ordered something and could have it delivered immediately to where they wanted it to go. Every step on the journey they could see, \u2018Where is my parcel?\u2019 People got used to that.\u201dWidespread adoption of radio chip tags in the air travel industry has not been easy to achieve, despite the efforts of the International Air Transport Association, a trade group. It has set a deadline of summer 2018 when all 265 member airlines should be able to track and fully trace bags \u2014 not only on their own flights, but also when passengers connect to other carriers.\u201cIt won\u2019t matter what technology they choose,\u201d said Nick Careen, an executive with the association, as long as bags can be tracked once they leave the traveler\u2019s hands and traced if they are missing.Airline bag tracking is difficult for a number of reasons. Updating to the latest technology requires infrastructure changes that can be expensive and disruptive. And because most airports leave it to each airline to handle its own bag-checking system, the technology and procedures vary widely.McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas is an exception, having decided as part of a renovation in 2005 to become fully capable of incorporating radio chips into the bag-checking and sorting system, which the airport runs.The radio chips embedded in the paper tags being used in Las Vegas ensure that checked suitcases move more quickly and accurately through the system and increase the likelihood that the bags make it onto the right airplanes.\u201cR.F.I.D. runs for us day in and day out very, very accurately \u2014 99.5 percent accuracy,\u201d said Samuel G. Ingalls, the airport\u2019s assistant director of information systems. The airport has handled 160 million chip-tagged bags in the last 10 years.There are many ways airlines and airports can use radio chips. In 2010, when Qantas became one of the first airlines to start using the technology, it sold a hard plastic reusable baggage tag for $60. A spokesman said 1.5 million tags were in circulation.Customers \u201clike the speed of checking in and the sense of control and recognition that comes with having their own permanent tag,\u201d said Phil Capps, Qantas\u2019s head of product and service development.Delta\u2019s single-use paper tags, like the ones in at McCarran, are much cheaper, at just pennies apiece.Accurate bag handling can save an airline the size of Delta a lot of money. Last year, it mishandled about 276,000 of the 120 million passenger bags it transported, according to statistics that it reported to the Department of Transportation. While that misfire rate \u2014 0.23 percent \u2014 is well below the international average of 0.65 percent for mishandled bags, it still adds up to a lot of unhappy customers.Even one passenger\u2019s bad experience can become a big embarrassment for an airline, given the effect of social media. During the day Ms. Rasheem was separated from her bag, which contained notes for a presentation she was to give, she tweeted her frustration \u2014 not just to Southwest but also to her 1,500 followers on Twitter.Ms. Rasheem\u2019s notes and clothes arrived before her conference began, with no explanation about what had happened.Southwest said it was still exploring what bag handling options it will use to meet the new target of the International Air Transport Association.While the airlines work toward a tracking standard, various vendors have rushed in with disparate versions of bags, tags and apps \u2014 some working in partnership with airlines. Rimowa, a German maker of luxe luggage, has an e-ink bar code and radio chip permanently affixed to the suitcases it sells. Passengers using the bags on Lufthansa flights can speed through check-in.\u201cWhenever you come with such a bag already tagged, you can place it on the bag drop belt and it will be checked automatically,\u201d said Bj\u00f6rn Becker, a senior director at Lufthansa who oversees ground and digital services.Whatever approach the airlines take, Mr. Careen of the air transport association echoes the sentiments of travelers like Ms. Rasheem when he says fliers should \u201cknow at all times where their bag is.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But it\u2019s also the essence of cultural nostalgia: the longing to find some \u201cthis\u201d that reproduces the cherished pleasures of some long-ago \u201cthat.\u201dNeither of them \u2014 unlike this year\u2019s \u201cThe X-Files\u201d or \u201cGhostbusters\u201d \u2014 is based on an existing franchise. They tickle our memory centers without inviting unflattering comparisons to some sainted original. They might succeed or not, but they\u2019re at least trying to reproduce part of what made us love our childhood favorites way back when: the joy of discovering something for the first time.As Joyce, whose son Will is sucked into a parallel plane of existence, Ms. Ryder plays the kind of single-mom character common in movies like \u201cE.T. the Extraterrestrial\u201d from the early \u201980s, a time of high divorce rates. But her circumstances are a little more raw and dire. (It\u2019s a financial hardship, for instance, for her to replace the landline phone Will blows up in his attempt to communicate.) The teenage characters, meanwhile, both recall and respond to their horror-movie forebears, like Nancy (Natalia Dyer), who has sex with her boyfriend yet doesn\u2019t become monster food as punishment.\u201cStranger Things\u201d isn\u2019t revolutionary \u2014 it\u2019s a tasty campfire s\u2019more, the kind of summer movie that the actual summer movie season didn\u2019t provide. But it manages to deliver on the appeal of nostalgia \u2014 the allure of simpler, innocent times \u2014 while letting on that it realizes those times were neither simpler nor more innocent.\u201cThe Get Down\u201d performs the opposite trick: It takes a period fixed in popular history as a nadir and turns it into a moment shimmering with possibility.From Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cSummer of Sam\u201d to the ESPN mini-series \u201cThe Bronx Is Burning\u201d (based on a book by The New York Times\u2019s Jonathan Mahler), 1977 has been portrayed as the year New York City bottomed out. \u201cThe Get Down,\u201d a fanciful origin story of hip-hop in the Bronx, presents it as the year a new urban culture impossibly took flight.Part of this is the influence of the creator Baz Luhrmann, who has never met a subject he wouldn\u2019t blast with a glitter cannon. The sensibility of \u201cThe Get Down\u201d is defiantly joyous, more \u201cThe Wiz\u201d than \u201cThe Warriors.\u201d There may be arson-torched apartment buildings and gaudily art-directed murders, but the series\u2019 true love is for orange limousines and tight, bumping disco pants.The show\u2019s stylistic pastiche is less blatant than those in \u201cStranger Things,\u201d but it even more forcefully wrestles with the popular conception of its setting. Where we expect to see problems, it sees opportunities \u2014 chances for invention and self-invention, even if it takes struggle.Compared with HBO\u2019s somber and now-canceled 1970s music drama, \u201cVinyl,\u201d \u201cThe Get Down\u201d is mainly a young people\u2019s story. It refuses to be pessimistic, and it\u2019s cast with vibrant young actors like Justice Smith and Herizen Guardiola, whose performances each contain a full day\u2019s supply of vitamin C.Like \u201cStranger Things,\u201d with its brick-size walkie-talkies, \u201cThe Get Down\u201d fetishizes predigital technology (here, turntables and crayon-marked LPs) as a means of liberating ingenious kids. Midseason, the Bronx is hit by the notorious blackout of 1977, whose chaos and looting got record players and mixing boards into the hands of the youth, written off, who will help create an American art form.\u201cStranger Things\u201d is much more fully formed. \u201cThe Get Down\u201d is plagued by a undisciplined ambition to be every story \u2014 melodrama, history, romance, musical comedy, political intrigue. It has electric moments, but only becomes focused intermittently, in the last couple hours of its six-episode initial run.But both shows are encouraging examples of how to use nostalgia for more than cheap hits of \u201cRemember that?\u201d Not unlike the DJs of \u201cThe Get Down,\u201d they practice a kind of scavenger\u2019s art, weaving samples and familiar hooks into kinetic new rhythms.

Work at the quarries peaked in 1910, as did Hardwick\u2019s population, hitting 3,200. The town then retrenched as it returned to its agricultural roots.Mr. Connelly, a trim man with close-cropped white hair and a steady gaze, who has carved out a small sitting space in front of piles of paper on his overstuffed wooden desk, has been the Gazette\u2019s steward for three decades. He is determined to find someone to whom to pass the torch.But when the contest closed Aug. 11, he had not received the 700 essays that he said was the minimum needed to make the contest financially viable. He would not say how many he had received, nor would he share the contents of the entries, saying he did not want to skew the judging.He did say that the paper, which has a paid circulation of 2,200, grossed $240,000 last year. He had figured that, with a contest entry fee of $175, 700 essays would yield enough, $122,500, to cover the Gazette building, computers and taxes and send him on his glide to retirement.He has a few guesses about why not enough entries materialized.\u201cMaybe the people who have experience know that you\u2019re not going to get rich and you\u2019re going to work your butt off,\u201d he said. \u201cThe hours are long and the pay is not great, and so they were smart enough to say, \u2018I don\u2019t want any part of this.\u2019\u201d\u201cAnd,\u201d he added, \u201cthere\u2019s a generation and a half now of people who don\u2019t even know what a newspaper is.\u201dWhat it is not, he said, is social media. \u201cFor someone to hold up a Facebook post as journalism is kind of an affront,\u201d he said.Journalism at The Gazette consists of keeping track of local government and the goings on here and in a few surrounding towns: With milk prices falling, for example, dairy farmers are banding together to increase their clout. The nearby town of Craftsbury, a Gazette reporter wrote, is \u201cjoining the 21st century\u201d with high-speed internet.Mr. Connelly says that he has also covered topics that some readers objected to, including a big bank scandal involving a local resident and the harassment of a transgender police officer by a town official.The paper, running 10 or 12 pages, is filled with the staples of community weeklies: local sports, calendars, birth announcements and obituaries, the police blotter and reviews of artistic endeavors. In last week\u2019s edition, one correspondent, Michael Bielawski, wrote five of the seven front-page stories.\u201cYou have to keep going back and become a familiar face to them, and then they begin to understand that we\u2019re a local business just like they are,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you have to spend four hours to get two ads, that\u2019s what you do.\u201dMr. Connelly takes a dim view of the headphone-wearing, phone-obsessed, plugged-in culture. So it is little surprise that The Gazette has avoided being available online.\u201cI don\u2019t believe in giving away my product,\u201d Mr. Connelly said. \u201cThat was one of the big mistakes newspapers made, because now you have people thinking it\u2019s free.\u201dIn his view, the hard copy of the paper fosters civic engagement in a way that a smartphone does not.\u201cWhen you pick up your paper, you may see a headline or a photograph that will grab your attention, and you\u2019ll say to the cashier or the person next to you, \u2018Did you see that?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt brings people together. It is a building block of democracy.\u201dNor is he impressed with social media; the anonymity of it, he said, can breed anarchy. By contrast, he prints letters to the editor only if they include the writer\u2019s signature, name, address and phone number.Mr. Connelly and his wife initially lived on the second floor of the Gazette building. Their son, Sawyer, 25, who works for a wildlife conservation group in Montana, wrote on the contest website his reminiscence of growing up at the paper.On production nights, he said, he would curl up under his mother\u2019s desk with the family dog \u201cand fall asleep amidst the sounds of keystrokes and the smell of coffee and ink.\u201dHe said that he and his father were unprepared to deal with his mother\u2019s death. The Gazette, he said, \u201cwas very much the two of them.\u201dNow, he said, \u201cand I\u2019m sure my mother would agree, it\u2019s time for my father to begin his next adventure.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Facebook was a college social site before it became a global media hub; Amazon was a bookseller before it was, well, everything.Joe MacMillan (Lee Pace), a mysterious, smooth-talking drifter of a businessman, was paired with Gordon Clark (Scoot McNairy), a brilliant but failed engineer, in a sketchy scheme to bring an IBM clone to market. As a plot, it was less than inspiring, and as a character story, less than inspired: an 8-bit Don Draper and a Walter White who dealt in megabytes rather than meth.But at the end of its first season, \u201cHalt\u201d did something almost unheard-of in television, if not in tech: It upended its entire project. With the introduction of the Apple Macintosh, Joe and Gordon discovered that they had been chasing yesterday\u2019s dream. They were thinking too small, too incrementally. The quest of the entire season had been a failure of imagination.The headlines then were about computing power coming to your desktop. But the long-term change, barely glimmering in the days of telephone modems, lay in the connection of every desktop to every other. It was the birth of the social internet, where we now live.Season 2 followed Mutiny, a nascent online gaming company started by Gordon\u2019s wife, Donna (Kerry Bish\u00e9), and Cameron Howe (Mackenzie Davis), an impassioned sparkplug of a programmer.For all practical purposes, the series changed not just its focus but its lead characters. Cameron was visionary but impractical; Donna relished the new start but chafed at being forced into the role of the buzz kill adult in the room. (Ms. Bish\u00e9 gave a nuanced, undersung performance.)This was something we hadn\u2019t seen so often before: a tricky but fruitful alliance between two women in a male-dominated industry. Cameron had the digital native\u2019s instinct to see the online world as a place of constant invention. Donna had the emotional intelligence to notice that Mutiny\u2019s social component \u2014 its chat rooms \u2014 was the future of the future.Season 3, which begins on Tuesday, continues the show\u2019s iterative-learning process, picking up in 1986, as Mutiny has relocated from Texas to Silicon Valley and is beginning to reconceive itself one more time. (Cameron and Donna have noticed their gamers\u2019 taking over Mutiny chat to negotiate real-world trades \u2014 shades of Craigslist or eBay.)The growing pains continue, throwing the women into the unfamiliar and testosterone-heavy world of venture capitalists. \u201cIt only takes one of them to ask you to the dance,\u201d says their consigliere, John Bosworth (Toby Huss). Cameron replies, \u201cI love how even the metaphors in this business are sexist.\u201d They find a possible ally in Diane (Annabeth Gish), a sympathetic but bluntly honest investor.Gordon has come along in tow, feeling at loose ends in a managerial role at Mutiny. The chameleonic Joe, meanwhile, has landed in California as the head of a software-security firm, sporting a Steve Jobsian beard and speaking in pretentious koans. (\u201cI\u2019ve been accused of selling fear,\u201d he tells a rapt audience. \u201cBut let me ask you: Is it fear or is it truth?\u201d)Joe\u2019s re-reinvention as a smug tech guru suits Mr. Pace, a striking but peculiar presence whom the show has struggled to use effectively. (He was well cast in the \u201cHobbit\u201d movies as the frosty, Eurotrash-y elven king Thranduil.) He seems fully at home now, strutting around his office listening to Gary Numan music, carrying himself like a human Patrick Nagel print.The new season takes time to reset, and the movement in the early episodes is slow. The character dynamics are solid, though, and the \u201980s details continue to be spot on. (At a fancy Valley restaurant, Donna stumbles over the pronunciation of a trendy new dish: risotto.)But any well-produced period piece can recreate bygone days. \u201cHalt\u201d lets you see them as the cusp of bracing change. The real product in its tech business isn\u2019t hardware or software \u2014 it\u2019s tomorrow, and \u201cHalt and Catch Fire\u201d makes its past future feel dewy and new.Advertisement"}

This fear is seen again in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s treatment of Muslim refugees. As an American teen, I see why people may fear these refugees. The media in all forms have consistently backed the trope depicting Muslims as terrorists. However, as a Muslim who has always been preached patience and kindness, I struggle to accept the ease with which my community has been maligned for late night TV show jokes/attention grabbing news headlines. However, reading \u00e2\u0080\u009cRefugees Encounter a Foreign Word: Welcome\u00e2\u0080\u009d renewed my faith that people are not blind to the unfair condemnation I see.

My parents were immigrants, and the tales of the trials they faced thirty years ago still brings tears to their eyes. I imagine an American guide could have eliminated years of their suffering. The Canadian program ensures refugees are becoming productive members of society and are not consistently running from the ghost of starvation or stuck behind the seemingly insurmountable language barrier. This article was a refreshing break from the anti-Muslim rhetoric common in the media.I don\u2019t think the act of some extremists should condemn over 1.6 billion others. Reading this heartfelt article, I was touched to see these Muslim refugees being treated like what they are.

{"Headline": "1.28 Billion Minutes Streamed (and NBC Is Still Counting)", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "Supported byTV SportsSTAMFORD, Conn. \u2014 NBC Sports\u2019 promise to stream every sport live at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro is fulfilled here at its headquarters \u2014 a former Clairol factory \u2014 where the digital feeds from every event are sent to tablets, computers, smartphones and other connected devices. They are visible on flat screens throughout the vast broadcast operations center \u2014 mosaics of sports that are being played simultaneously.Streaming is a part of NBC\u2019s Olympic future \u2014 an extension and repudiation of a history in which the prime-time broadcast was not to be trifled with. But the new model is unfolding in Rio: unfettered live streaming of all events and live Olympic programming on NBCUniversal\u2019s cable networks, combined with NBC\u2019s traditional prime-time broadcast, which has live and taped elements.Through Thursday, NBC\u2019s live streaming had reached 1.28 billion minutes \u2014 more than in all of the 2012 London Olympics. The minutes have helped NBC add the equivalent of a few hundred thousand viewers to a prime-time broadcast audience that has fallen since 2012. Still, NBC\u2019s streaming is less than halfway to the 2.6 billion live minutes that ESPN streamed during the 2014 World Cup.\u201cGoing past one billion minutes \u2014 I\u2019m impressed, excited and overjoyed,\u201d said Eric Black, the chief technology officer of NBC Sports Group Digital, who has watched Olympic streaming advance, sometimes fitfully, over several Olympics. He recalled an unexpectedly large surge of streaming during the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, for the men\u2019s United States-Russia preliminary-round game in hockey, at 7:30 a.m. Eastern.\u201cWe expected an O.K. crowd, but it went viral, and went to a shootout,\u201d he said. \u201cThe numbers rose dramatically, and we had to add more video sources to back it up.\u201d Nearly 600,000 unique users streamed the game, the most in Olympic hockey\u2019s short online viewing history.16 PhotosSo far in Rio, that number has been eclipsed by five streams: two from swimming, the opening ceremony (which was not shown live), and the women\u2019s gymnastics all-around final (1.16 million) and team final (1.35 million).By comparison, the average World Cup game on ESPN two years ago averaged about 900,000 unique users.Chris Reed, a freelance writer and publicist in Los Angeles, said in an interview Friday that he had been streaming gymnastics live in the afternoon on his tablet because he was unwilling to wait until NBC showed it on a tape delay on the West Coast.\u201cTake gymnastics yesterday,\u201d he said, referring to the all-around final won by Simone Biles of the United States. \u201cDo I stay up until midnight to see how they did and avoid all social media, or watch it live? The answer was to watch it live and celebrate with the rest of the country.\u201dStreaming has become an essential way to view sports and entertainment as people change the way they consume media: cutting the cords to their subscriptions with satellite, cable and telephone companies; binge-watching new series on internet services like Netflix and Amazon; and choosing mobile devices for watching the sports that they (or their parents) once tuned in to their televisions for.The NBC building is in full Olympics mode, and not only for streaming. It is a bustling northern outpost of the International Broadcast Center in Rio. One of its large studios is filled with portable announcing and production booths where announcers call many of the sports NBC is showing, from archery and badminton to rugby and weight lifting. They describe the action using video feeds from Rio with the ambient sounds of the venues piped to their headsets. In one quirk of the setup, Mary Carillo calls tennis from the broadcast center in Brazil; one of her partners, Rennae Stubbs, speaks from one of the booths in Stamford; and a reporter works on site at the tennis arena.Black and his staff spend much of their time making sure the live streams run without serious glitches, a task that was largely unheard-of when he began working in the early 2000s as the webmaster at WNBC-TV\u2019s website in New York. \u201cWe pointed a camera at the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree \u2014 it was like Yule log \u2014 and people watched it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you think about it, that was pretty advanced for 2002.\u201dOn a wall in Black\u2019s office is a large heat map \u2014 its colors ranging from pale yellow to dark orange \u2014 that shows the number of concurrent video feeds scheduled, in 15-minute intervals, to be streamed or televised by the NBC networks carrying the Rio Games every day. The peak was reached last Saturday when about 50 feeds were live simultaneously, 40 of them streams produced by the Olympics\u2019 world broadcaster.\u201cMy 5-year-old godson loves it that Uncle Eric makes it possible to watch soccer on the iPhone,\u201d Black said.Although he is a devoted fan of New York teams and of boxing, his job has led him to redefine what his favorite sports are.They are, he said, \u201cthe streams that start and end successfully.\u201dHe added, \u201cAfter we streamed our first Super Bowl, I had no idea who won.\u201dBut those who stream often care, some quite deeply, in a world where people want to be entertained on demand \u2014 and buffering of the live hammer throw or trouble signing on to NBCOlympics.com can be causes for an angry tweet.Email: sandor@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}

Often, faith has been relegated to syrupy treatments (\u201cTouched by an Angel\u201d), used as a vehicle for supernatural plots (see Fox\u2019s \u201cThe Exorcist,\u201d coming this fall, and Cinemax\u2019s \u201cOutcast\u201d) or ignored altogether. It\u2019s rare to see the kind of immersive depiction that a series like \u201cGreenleaf\u201d makes possible: religion as a way of life, a means for good and bad and struggling people to engage with existence.Given the sheer number of series in the age of peak TV and the recent focus on diversity of all kinds, there should be room for religion and religious diversity, too. But are things changing, and how? Here, the New York Times critics Margaret Lyons and James Poniewozik survey how television\u2019s congregation has expanded and where there\u2019s still room for improvement.Prayer on TV is sort of a pet project for me. I\u2019m always on the lookout for it because it\u2019s something that\u2019s extremely common in life but comparatively rare on TV. According to a Pew Forum survey, 55 percent of American adults say they pray at least daily. And 77 percent say that religion is either very or somewhat important in their lives. I don\u2019t in any way expect or even want TV to be a strictly representative portrayal of society, but this strikes me as something it is particularly unlikely to depict. (\u201cLast Chance U\u201d is a documentary, so it plays by different rules than scripted programming.) Is it something you keep an eye out for?Why does this kind of representation matter? Because religious diversity is not getting any less important in public life. Because good stories are specific, and personal faith (or the conscious lack of it) is as specific as it gets. And because religion tries to answer some of the same questions that art does, about human frailties and emotion and dealing with the knowledge that you will die someday.All of which can be legitimate \u2014 some people do turn to a higher power only when things get rough. But there\u2019s also religion as a routine, even dull part of daily life. \u201cFriday Night Lights\u201d did this well: Christianity (this was small-town Texas) was a steady part of life from Sunday church to Landry\u2019s speed-metal garage band. (Crucifictorius forever!) But it was an exception.Still, these are exceptions, whether because of nervousness or plain old secularist bias. Which areas of TV do you think are doing well by religion now? And do you find it sneaking in any places you wouldn\u2019t have expected?Lots of shows that aren\u2019t about religion still have That One Character Who\u2019s Christian \u2014 think April Kepner, who initially avoided premarital sex and struggled to align her Christianity with her (now ex-) husband\u2019s atheism on \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d or Grace, the teenage daughter on \u201cThe Good Wife.\u201d Maybe this character is called upon to pray during particularly trying times, or to provide a morality lesson to other characters. This is maybe my least favorite deployment of TV God.There\u2019s nothing wrong with stories in which religion or religiosity is a symbol. But most of us don\u2019t experience our religious \u2014 or atheist, or agnostic or \u201cspiritual\u201d \u2014 identities as metaphor. We experience it the way the characters on \u201cGreenleaf\u201d experience it, which is as a matter of course.Yet good comedies should be among the best places to treat religion. It\u2019s comedies, more than dramas, through which we get stories of workaday and family life outside heightened circumstances. Believers can be as funny as anyone \u2014 so can clergy members, even when they\u2019re not walking into a bar in groups of three.So far, so Christian. (I come from a mixed Christian-and-Jewish family; I went to Catholic church with my father as a kid; now my wife and kids and I are very secular Jews.) We\u2019ve come a ways since the days \u201ctoo Jewish\u201d was a byword on TV, but it\u2019s still a rarity to see a show like Amazon\u2019s \u201cTransparent,\u201d which is so thoroughly Jewish that its second-season holiday episode took place on Yom Kippur \u2014 as befits a show where everyone has things to atone for.But beyond that? It\u2019s nice to see a Jewish-Hindu wedding on \u201cNew Girl.\u201d But we\u2019re still waiting for the much-theorized-about Muslim equivalent of \u201cThe Cosby Show\u201d \u2014 the mainstream hit series that lets a wide audience embrace another culture on the deepest, most humane level of laughs.If we\u2019re talking comedy, let\u2019s shout-out the most churchgoing family on TV: the Simpsons. That show has found plenty of comic material in religion, including with God himself. \u201cSouth Park\u201d has, notoriously, not shied away from addressing religion, though it engages with the idea of religion from a strictly secular gaze.Way, way on the other side of things is a drama conflicted about its ideas on non-Christian religion: \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d (I have complained to my \u201cGoT\u201d-fan friends that the show really needs a Hildegard of Bingen-type character. I am fun!) The show uses religion both in metaphorical and literal ways: General structures of power, both religious and not, are corrupted and crumbling. But \u201cmagic,\u201d broadly defined, is also re-entering everyday life. We\u2019re meant to be skeptical of religion qua institution but open to the idea that its teachings are perhaps legitimate.This is maybe a good place to say a word for considered nonbelief, which is a kind of belief in itself. You mentioned Grace on \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d; her embrace of God especially matters in contrast with the atheism of her mother, Alicia (a particular liability, the show made clear, for an aspiring politician). Neither is portrayed as right or wrong \u2014 the important thing, from the show\u2019s perspective, is that they\u2019re each asking moral questions, not how they come to the answers.I\u2019d also argue that \u201cThe Leftovers,\u201d for all its attention to fictional cults, is about the importance of religion as we know it, and more specifically, what happens when faith is shaken. In its world, the underpinnings of every established religion are struck at once, after 2 percent of the Earth\u2019s population vanishes, in a way that does not comport with any denomination\u2019s teaching. Overtly, it asks what would happen if millions of people vanished. Implicitly, it asks what would happen if God did. (A question \u201cPreacher\u201d is also asking now, with a lot more slapstick and gore and a lot less reflection.)Advertisement"}

And because religion tries to answer some of the same questions that art does, about human frailties and emotion and dealing with the knowledge that you will die someday.All of which can be legitimate \u2014 some people do turn to a higher power only when things get rough. But there\u2019s also religion as a routine, even dull part of daily life. \u201cFriday Night Lights\u201d did this well: Christianity (this was small-town Texas) was a steady part of life from Sunday church to Landry\u2019s speed-metal garage band. (Crucifictorius forever!) But it was an exception.Still, these are exceptions, whether because of nervousness or plain old secularist bias. Which areas of TV do you think are doing well by religion now? And do you find it sneaking in any places you wouldn\u2019t have expected?Lots of shows that aren\u2019t about religion still have That One Character Who\u2019s Christian \u2014 think April Kepner, who initially avoided premarital sex and struggled to align her Christianity with her (now ex-) husband\u2019s atheism on \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d or Grace, the teenage daughter on \u201cThe Good Wife.\u201d Maybe this character is called upon to pray during particularly trying times, or to provide a morality lesson to other characters. This is maybe my least favorite deployment of TV God.There\u2019s nothing wrong with stories in which religion or religiosity is a symbol. But most of us don\u2019t experience our religious \u2014 or atheist, or agnostic or \u201cspiritual\u201d \u2014 identities as metaphor. We experience it the way the characters on \u201cGreenleaf\u201d experience it, which is as a matter of course.Yet good comedies should be among the best places to treat religion. It\u2019s comedies, more than dramas, through which we get stories of workaday and family life outside heightened circumstances. Believers can be as funny as anyone \u2014 so can clergy members, even when they\u2019re not walking into a bar in groups of three.So far, so Christian. (I come from a mixed Christian-and-Jewish family; I went to Catholic church with my father as a kid; now my wife and kids and I are very secular Jews.) We\u2019ve come a ways since the days \u201ctoo Jewish\u201d was a byword on TV, but it\u2019s still a rarity to see a show like Amazon\u2019s \u201cTransparent,\u201d which is so thoroughly Jewish that its second-season holiday episode took place on Yom Kippur \u2014 as befits a show where everyone has things to atone for.But beyond that? It\u2019s nice to see a Jewish-Hindu wedding on \u201cNew Girl.\u201d But we\u2019re still waiting for the much-theorized-about Muslim equivalent of \u201cThe Cosby Show\u201d \u2014 the mainstream hit series that lets a wide audience embrace another culture on the deepest, most humane level of laughs.If we\u2019re talking comedy, let\u2019s shout-out the most churchgoing family on TV: the Simpsons. That show has found plenty of comic material in religion, including with God himself. \u201cSouth Park\u201d has, notoriously, not shied away from addressing religion, though it engages with the idea of religion from a strictly secular gaze.Way, way on the other side of things is a drama conflicted about its ideas on non-Christian religion: \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d (I have complained to my \u201cGoT\u201d-fan friends that the show really needs a Hildegard of Bingen-type character. I am fun!) The show uses religion both in metaphorical and literal ways: General structures of power, both religious and not, are corrupted and crumbling. But \u201cmagic,\u201d broadly defined, is also re-entering everyday life. We\u2019re meant to be skeptical of religion qua institution but open to the idea that its teachings are perhaps legitimate.This is maybe a good place to say a word for considered nonbelief, which is a kind of belief in itself. You mentioned Grace on \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d; her embrace of God especially matters in contrast with the atheism of her mother, Alicia (a particular liability, the show made clear, for an aspiring politician). Neither is portrayed as right or wrong \u2014 the important thing, from the show\u2019s perspective, is that they\u2019re each asking moral questions, not how they come to the answers.I\u2019d also argue that \u201cThe Leftovers,\u201d for all its attention to fictional cults, is about the importance of religion as we know it, and more specifically, what happens when faith is shaken. In its world, the underpinnings of every established religion are struck at once, after 2 percent of the Earth\u2019s population vanishes, in a way that does not comport with any denomination\u2019s teaching. Overtly, it asks what would happen if millions of people vanished. Implicitly, it asks what would happen if God did. (A question \u201cPreacher\u201d is also asking now, with a lot more slapstick and gore and a lot less reflection.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Raiding an Illegal Gold-Mining Ring in Peru\u2019s Amazon Jungle? Easy. Getting There? Next to Impossible.", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI braced myself when I realized the water was about to go over the top of my rubber boots. I had already spent hours working my way down a path in the Amazon jungle, traveling with Peruvian soldiers who were on a mission to close down illegal gold-mining operations.\u201cTake the step,\u201d I thought to myself. \u201cYou have no choice anyhow. You can\u2019t turn around now. And it can\u2019t get much worse.\u201dI was wrong. Soon, I was in swirling water up to my armpits, and I heard one of the soldiers ask whether I knew how to swim. It would take us another six hours to get out of there.None of this was part of my plan. My plan had been simple. Illegal gold miners were destroying Peru\u2019s Amazon jungle. The government was intent on shutting them down. I would go on a ride-along, swooping into the jungle in a helicopter filled with government agents whose mission was to surprise the miners, destroy their camps and put them out of business. By night fall, the helicopter would have me back to a semi-decent hotel, hot water and a good bed.I had pestered for months to get permission to see Peru\u2019s efforts to halt the army of illegal miners that was already turning patches of the Tambopata reserve, one of the most biologically diverse places on earth, into toxic wasteland.I wanted to see the fight up close, not just because such access is rare but because there is no substitute for being there. It offers an understanding that no amount of reading and talking with experts \u2014 or looking at detailed satellite photos \u2014 can make up for. It allows you to tell a story with a special kind of authority. Whatever the discomfort, it is usually worth the effort.And yet sometimes you have little insight into what\u2019s coming. The night before we were to go, photographer Tomas Munita and I got word that we would be traveling by road, mostly on motorbikes, and spending the night at a rangers outpost in a remote area along the Malinowski river.Still, I thought, I was traveling with soldiers. What could happen?Tomas and I went off to the local market to buy rubber boots and ponchos, choosing the thick expensive ones. I packed a change of clothes in a small gym bag that looked waterproof. Tomas suggested I pack everything inside in plastic bags, just in case \u2014 an idea that turned out to be brilliant.By 6 a.m., we were at the mouth of a trail. Only then did the rangers explain that they had just four working dirt bikes, and they intended to run a shuttle service for our group of about 12 people. Tomas (who had agreed to be my translator since I was not allowed to bring one) was hustled onto one of the bikes. I would not see him again for 11 hours. Those of us left behind were told to start walking. My group included a small band of armed soldiers and two young women less than half my age \u2014 one a ranger intern, the other their videographer.At first, there was plenty of chitchat, much of which I could not understand. But as the trail disappeared under water \u2014 and it became harder and harder to keep from slipping, tripping or falling into a hole \u2014 we moved in total silence. The loudest sound in the forest was the rain hitting leaves, hard.Gangs controlled the other \u201croads,\u201d and there was a possibility we would be ambushed even here, a factor that was in the back of my mind. But soon the conditions were so bad that an attack seemed a very remote possibility. I was more worried about broken legs, snakebites, parasites and other gross things.No one had a radio. Our cellphones didn\u2019t work. And it was clear that no bikes would be coming back to get us.I was in one of the most beautiful settings on earth. But that fact intruded on my thoughts only occasionally. We walked for nine and a half hours, mostly in water. The poncho turned out to be porous. The new boots, soaking wet, were heavy and began to kill my toes. I had expected heat. But the water was cold. I was shivering. As with every other time I have ended up in a dangerous situation while reporting, my mind went over and over where I had made the stupid mistake that had landed me in such a spot.Eventually, some of the rangers who had gone ahead on bikes waded back to help us out of there. Perhaps because I was old enough to be their mother, the soldiers and rangers seemed unsure of how to deal with me. But one finally offered me his hand. I wondered later whether he regretted it. I did not let go of him for at least two hours as he inched forward first, trying to guide me to solid footing.Over the next two days (yes, one night turned into two) I watched these young men work so hard to do their job right. Some showed a deep knowledge and love of the rain forest they were trying to protect. But it was a shock to see how poorly equipped and vastly outmanned they were.Most spoke not a word of English. But even so, as I slipped down the 15-foot muddy embankment to get into a motorized canoe or got my boots stuck in the quicksand-like beach along the river, one of them always seemed there to hold my hand.My Fitbit didn\u2019t survive the soaking. The clothes I wore and slept in were so stained with gooey muck that they would go straight into the garbage. I am in the process of losing one of my toe nails.But as we headed for a different path home, I knew I had gotten what I wanted for my story. Going up the river away from the miners, we were in a still-pristine area. There, at dawn, we spotted a jaguar in the water swimming from shore to shore. The men turned off the boat engine to watch as the animal climbed out on a pebbly stretch.Then they burst out laughing. Our jaguar was fat. In this area of the reserve, at least for now, all was well.Advertisement"}

Synchronized Swimming Themes Can Be Mystifying", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Down in the pool, the Australian synchronized swimming duo was performing a three-minute whistle-stop tour of the animals of the outback \u2014 kookaburras, emus, centipedes \u2014 to music from \u201cCrocodile Dundee.\u201d In the stands, the American mother-daughter duo of Ruth and Emily Thunstrum was trying to figure out what, exactly, was going on.\u201cThere was definitely a bird of some kind,\u201d Emily said.\u201cI think there was a crocodile,\u201d Ruth answered. \u201cYou should know \u2014 you spent that time in Australia.\u201dYou do not have to be from someplace other than Australia to be mystified by synchronized swimming, a sport that lies in the corner of the Twilight Zone where Kabuki opera meets advanced underwater survival. It may look as if the athletes are simply gesticulating emphatically, flinging themselves around in improbable aquatic configurations, and executing shockingly complex leg movements while upside down and not breathing. But that\u2019s not the half of it.Each synchro routine also has an elaborate theme, and each theme must be conveyed with grace, precision and dramatically relevant facial gestures, as well as moves like the catalina rotation (rotate your body while holding your leg, ballet-style, in the air) and the vertical descent (descend, straight upside down, until your toes are submerged). The athletes also have to do each move at the same time and make it seem fun and not hard at all, even when they are heaving, hypoxic and about to pass out.Sometimes the themes are obvious and careworn: Every competition seems to include at least one \u201cSwan Lake\u201d (hello, Austria). They can also be hideously ill conceived.One strange feature of the sport is that despite all the attention lavished on the themes, even the judges cannot always work out what they are.\u201cNot all the judges get the story,\u201d said Irene Hawes, a longtime synchro judge.Take the \u201cFirebird\u201d suite by Stravinsky, she said. \u201cThere\u2019s the phoenix rising and the battle and all that. A lot of people don\u2019t know that.\u201dShe continued, \u201cI remember one routine was meant to be a tumbleweed, and the athletes were rolling along the deck, and people were wondering what they were doing.\u201d She figured it out, she said, only when the competition ended and \u201cthe country handed out a flier.\u201dStill, synchro athletes said, the narratives help both them and the spectators.\u201cIt\u2019s much more interesting to watch a routine that has a specific theme in it,\u201d said Bianca Hammett, captain of the Australian synchro team.She said the team\u2019s free routine was \u201ca journey through the unique flora and fauna of Australia.\u201d It features both the obvious (crocodiles: athletes\u2019 legs snapping open and shut) and the not.\u201cWe have a lizards\u2019 dance party,\u201d Hammett said. \u201cWe put our hands near our heads, like we\u2019re mimicking lizards.\u201dMany synchro teams pick themes celebrating their countries. The Spanish duo in Rio is doing a Flamenco routine while the Brazilians are depicting natural life in the Amazon. Britain is representing snakes (always popular, because of their watery sinuousness); the Kazakhs, ravens. The Swiss theme is \u201cOrient bazaar,\u201d whatever that means, while the French, with renewed Gallic ambition, have selected \u201cAfrica.\u201d The Russians, who almost always win, are modestly pretending to be mermaids.Another challenge: The choreography has to fit the music.\u201cIf you used a ballet but did, like, robot-type movements, we would see it as strange,\u201d Hawes said. \u201cSame thing if it has a crescendo and you\u2019re doing absolutely nothing but laying on your back. If it has a winding type of sound, which wants spinning, and you\u2019re doing marches \u2014 these are factors.\u201dEvery judge has pet peeves. Many people at the 2012 London Games did not care for Canada\u2019s team program, which looked more like an Esther Williams extravaganza than a sports routine and which Hawes denounced as \u201cgross.\u201d13 Photos\u201cIt had to do with their headgear \u2014 large swimming caps covered with plastic flowers \u2014 their extreme facial moves, and the spitting of water,\u201d Hawes said.As for Linda Loehndorf, another judge \u2014 spare her the circus programs.\u201cIt\u2019s like, ugh,\u201d she said. \u201cI get it. You\u2019re a clown. You don\u2019t need to stick your tongue out at me.\u201dAnd then there are particularly memorable performances. Last year, for instance, China unveiled an electrifying routine that at first seemed destined for clich\u00e9 corner.\u201cI thought, Oh, jeez, not that again \u2014 \u2018The Phantom of the Opera,\u2019\u201d Loehndorf said. \u201cIt\u2019s something you hear over and over again. But they managed to tell the whole story in four and a half minutes, and I got it completely. It was a goosebumps-on-the-arms sort of thing.\u201dAnd people still speak with awe about Spain\u2019s daring 2009 performance to \u201cStairway to Heaven,\u201d the cryptic song that launched a thousand sweaty slow dances.For those who have long been made to wonder, the team\u2019s interpretation of the always challenging \u201cbustle in your hedgerow\u201d lyric offered as plausible an explanation as any. There was a line of athletes lying head-to-toe in the water, arms and legs stretched out, possibly like a hedge wearing a selection of bathing suits; there were two athletes off to the side, performing what was surely a bustle.\u201cIt was gorgeous,\u201d Loehndorf said.Advertisement"}

The company, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, also earned more money from vendors, who pay to sell and advertise their goods on its sites.The company said sales rose 59 percent in the first quarter to $4.8 billion. Its operating profit rose 71 percent to $1.3 billion.For many American investors, Alibaba is seen as a proxy for the health of the Chinese economy and the strength of its consumers. The company has outperformed the broader retail market in China. It has also been investing in the growth of e-commerce in the country \u2014 focusing on logistics and on rural areas where fewer people are online \u2014 so it can continue to grow even as the country\u2019s economy slows.The company is also working hard to brace itself for a further slowdown in China, pushing out of its conventional online shopping business into cloud computing, entertainment through online video and gaming, and even a food delivery business. Those long-term efforts have had mixed results. Results this quarter, for instance, showed that the company\u2019s smartphone-based food delivery business, Koubei, continued to burn cash competing with rivals.Yet other sectors have been more promising. Alibaba\u2019s cloud computing service, which is similar to the one offered by Amazon, has quickly gained traction in China, where businesses have been relying on Alibaba for computing power.Alibaba\u2019s gross merchandise volume, a closely watched measure of the transactions on the company\u2019s websites, grew 24 percent compared with the same period a year earlier, about the same pace as the prior quarter.Investors bid Alibaba\u2019s shares up more than 2 percent in premarket trading on the results.The underlying assumption that slowing growth in China will eventually hurt Alibaba\u2019s sales has focused more attention on its other businesses. During its recent investor day, Alibaba said it would start to offer more information on its efforts in sectors like entertainment and food delivery.\u201cWe have already started to see early signs of business breakthroughs in new categories and some of its burgeoning growth assets,\u201d Evan Zhou, a Credit Suisse analyst, wrote in a recent report.Yet those new breakthroughs come with risk. In the cloud computing sector, Alibaba has to contend with foreign rivals, and it faces a domestic challenge from the search engine Baidu. Its food delivery business risks becoming a drain on earnings, as many similar companies fight to gain customers by offering big commissions to drivers.Alibaba has also recently increased its focus on international expansion. While much of its efforts are centered on bringing foreign vendors to sell to Chinese consumers \u2014 and in turn spending marketing dollars on Alibaba\u2019s platforms \u2014 the company has also made bets on e-commerce in neighboring developing markets.The company invested in the Indian commerce companies Paytm and Snapdeal, and this year, it made its largest overseas acquisition, paying $1 billion to take over Lazada, a popular Southeast Asian shopping website.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Macy\u2019s to Close 100 Stores as E-Rivals and Discounting Hit Legacy Retailers", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor legacy stores, the fallout from this shift has been profound, perhaps never more apparent than this week. Macy\u2019s, the country\u2019s largest department store, said on Thursday that it would close 100 stores, saying they were more valuable as real estate properties. Walmart, the world\u2019s largest retailer, announced on Monday that it would buy a small online rival for more than $3 billion. The hope is that the deal will reverse its sputtering online growth.Other retailers have taken aggressive action, too, trying to turn their fortunes around. Billions of dollars have been poured into e-commerce efforts. Stores have turned to sharp discounting, temporarily lifting sales but hurting profits and upsetting partners.But almost always, these efforts have led to mediocre results. And the decisions by Walmart and Macy\u2019s, two towering figures in the industry, have sent a clear message: The pressure to keep up with customers is at a boiling point.\u201cThese legacy players are having a terrible time navigating through that shift successfully,\u201d said Mark A. Cohen, the director of retail studies at Columbia Business School.For decades, Americans have relied on the country\u2019s dense footprint of shopping centers and department stores for their prom dresses, paper towels and everything in between. Often, they were willing to drive to the mall, pay full price or wait for annual sales to get a deal.But that has been transformed in the last decade, with the meteoric rise of the online giant Amazon, discount and low-cost stores like T. J. Maxx gaining popularity, and a long recession that reset the value of a dollar.\u201cGiven the convenience of e-commerce, the consumer needs a really good reason to go to a store and park their car,\u201d said Edward Yruma, a managing director at KeyBanc Capital Markets. \u201cIt has to be exciting and have something new, because if not, why wouldn\u2019t I sit on my couch in my pajamas and shop on my iPad?\u201dFor retailers, that new reality is playing out in a variety of ways. Some, like Sports Authority, have thrown up their hands and closed. Others, like Express, have started opening outlet stores in regular malls.T. J. Maxx, Marshalls and outlet stores have boomed by loudly advertising big savings over their full-priced department store rivals, spurring some to create their own versions. Nordstrom long ago created Nordstrom Rack, for example, while Macy\u2019s recently introduced Macy\u2019s Backstage. But in many cases, heavy discounts and lower-priced offshoots have eroded the power of traditional stars to lure in shoppers.The situations at Macy\u2019s and Walmart, and their reactions this week, capture the large forces at play, and the sense that major changes need to be made to thrive.Walmart is already a discount behemoth, with 4,627 stores in the United States, but it has not been able to duplicate its dominance online. It isn\u2019t for lack of trying. The company has dedicated its deep pockets to the effort, building a large engineering outpost in Silicon Valley, the heart of the tech industry.But like other discount retailers, it has been unable to convert its vast network of warehouses and stores into a seamless and highly profitable online enterprise. In some ways, the ease of its online shopping site also lags those of some tech competitors. While Walmart is the second largest online retailer, it is far behind Amazon, which has an efficient network of distribution centers and a robust, standard-setting site.\u201cSomething drastic had to be done,\u201d said Bernard Sosnick, a retail analyst at Madison Global Partners.That something was buying Jet.com, an unprofitable, year-old start-up, for about $3 billion, the biggest e-commerce acquisition ever in the United States. Jet offers Walmart an edge in the online bulk-buying space. It also gives it Marc Lore, a founder of Jet who is widely considered a top e-commerce executive. Another company he helped start, Quidsi.com, was sold to Amazon for more than $500 million.\u201cNone of these traditional brick-and-mortar retailers feel like they can move fast enough to stave off the competition,\u201d said Liz Dunn, chief executive of Talmage Advisors, a retail consulting firm.As companies like Sears and J. C. Penney experienced long and fast declines, Macy\u2019s had often been held up as one of the few retailers that had managed to withstand the new environment. But it, too, now feels pressure on multiple fronts.It faces major competition from online sites like Amazon, which is beginning to make inroads in apparel. The biggest threat, though, comes from discount chains like T. J. Maxx, some of which have little online presence.The challenges have put heavy shareholder pressure on the company. Shares in the stock have fallen more than 40 percent in the last 12 months. In June, the company announced that Jeffrey Gennette, its president and a longtime Macy\u2019s executive, would replace Terry J. Lundgren as chief executive next year.As the share price has fallen, investors have pressured Macy\u2019s to sell some of its real estate. Macy\u2019s closed 41 stores in its last fiscal year, and said on Thursday that it was in talks to sell its men\u2019s store on San Francisco\u2019s Union Square.The store closings were announced along with quarterly earnings, in which Macy\u2019s reported that profits fell to $11 million last quarter, down from $217 million in the same period last year. Sales fell 3.9 percent, to $5.87 billion.Investors were clearly upbeat about the overall message, though. The stock rose more than 17 percent on Thursday.Macy\u2019s currently operates 728 stores, including 675 full-line locations. It did not specify which stores would close. And it said it did not know how many employees would be laid off, but said that it would offer severance to full- and part-time workers.\u201cFor Macy\u2019s, they still believe in stores. They\u2019re just acknowledging that a lot of the business has shifted online and away from some lower-quality malls,\u201d Ms. Dunn said.Advertisement"}

But Netflix owns a bigger percentage of it than most, simply because the past is built into its business model.\u201cIf you liked that, you\u2019ll like this\u201d is the watchword of the streaming service\u2019s algorithm. But it\u2019s also the essence of cultural nostalgia: the longing to find some \u201cthis\u201d that reproduces the cherished pleasures of some long-ago \u201cthat.\u201dNeither of them \u2014 unlike this year\u2019s \u201cThe X-Files\u201d or \u201cGhostbusters\u201d \u2014 is based on an existing franchise. They tickle our memory centers without inviting unflattering comparisons to some sainted original. They might succeed or not, but they\u2019re at least trying to reproduce part of what made us love our childhood favorites way back when: the joy of discovering something for the first time.As Joyce, whose son Will is sucked into a parallel plane of existence, Ms. Ryder plays the kind of single-mom character common in movies like \u201cE.T. the Extraterrestrial\u201d from the early \u201980s, a time of high divorce rates. But her circumstances are a little more raw and dire. (It\u2019s a financial hardship, for instance, for her to replace the landline phone Will blows up in his attempt to communicate.) The teenage characters, meanwhile, both recall and respond to their horror-movie forebears, like Nancy (Natalia Dyer), who has sex with her boyfriend yet doesn\u2019t become monster food as punishment.\u201cStranger Things\u201d isn\u2019t revolutionary \u2014 it\u2019s a tasty campfire s\u2019more, the kind of summer movie that the actual summer movie season didn\u2019t provide. But it manages to deliver on the appeal of nostalgia \u2014 the allure of simpler, innocent times \u2014 while letting on that it realizes those times were neither simpler nor more innocent.\u201cThe Get Down\u201d performs the opposite trick: It takes a period fixed in popular history as a nadir and turns it into a moment shimmering with possibility.From Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cSummer of Sam\u201d to the ESPN mini-series \u201cThe Bronx Is Burning\u201d (based on a book by The New York Times\u2019s Jonathan Mahler), 1977 has been portrayed as the year New York City bottomed out. \u201cThe Get Down,\u201d a fanciful origin story of hip-hop in the Bronx, presents it as the year a new urban culture impossibly took flight.Part of this is the influence of the creator Baz Luhrmann, who has never met a subject he wouldn\u2019t blast with a glitter cannon. The sensibility of \u201cThe Get Down\u201d is defiantly joyous, more \u201cThe Wiz\u201d than \u201cThe Warriors.\u201d There may be arson-torched apartment buildings and gaudily art-directed murders, but the series\u2019 true love is for orange limousines and tight, bumping disco pants.The show\u2019s stylistic pastiche is less blatant than those in \u201cStranger Things,\u201d but it even more forcefully wrestles with the popular conception of its setting. Where we expect to see problems, it sees opportunities \u2014 chances for invention and self-invention, even if it takes struggle.Compared with HBO\u2019s somber and now-canceled 1970s music drama, \u201cVinyl,\u201d \u201cThe Get Down\u201d is mainly a young people\u2019s story. It refuses to be pessimistic, and it\u2019s cast with vibrant young actors like Justice Smith and Herizen Guardiola, whose performances each contain a full day\u2019s supply of vitamin C.Like \u201cStranger Things,\u201d with its brick-size walkie-talkies, \u201cThe Get Down\u201d fetishizes predigital technology (here, turntables and crayon-marked LPs) as a means of liberating ingenious kids. Midseason, the Bronx is hit by the notorious blackout of 1977, whose chaos and looting got record players and mixing boards into the hands of the youth, written off, who will help create an American art form.\u201cStranger Things\u201d is much more fully formed. \u201cThe Get Down\u201d is plagued by a undisciplined ambition to be every story \u2014 melodrama, history, romance, musical comedy, political intrigue. It has electric moments, but only becomes focused intermittently, in the last couple hours of its six-episode initial run.But both shows are encouraging examples of how to use nostalgia for more than cheap hits of \u201cRemember that?\u201d Not unlike the DJs of \u201cThe Get Down,\u201d they practice a kind of scavenger\u2019s art, weaving samples and familiar hooks into kinetic new rhythms.

{"Headline": "Why It\u2019s Not Enough Just to Be Disruptive", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother ViewThe unanimous takeaway has been that incumbents everywhere are poised to get their clocks cleaned by a stampede of disruptive insurgents \u2014 unless they buy them first.This analysis, however, misdiagnoses recent transactions as a series of new-versus-old shootouts.To be sure, the web has been grinding down barriers to entry for 20 years, reducing the advantages of incumbents. For new entrants, this flatter playing field creates opportunity. But since the key tools at their disposal are universally available \u2014 including to companies like Facebook and Google, with enormous scale advantages \u2014 this only helps them get into the game, not capture any value lost by legacy firms. Short-term success may be driven by exceptional execution; long-term value creation requires building a defensible model.Any microeconomics textbook will tell you there are limited sources of competitive advantage. The most valuable companies combine several reinforcing strands, like scale and customer loyalty. Gillette has long been, literally, a textbook example.In 1996, Warren E. Buffett, then the largest shareholder in Gillette, commented: \u201cYou go to bed feeling very comfortable just thinking about two and a half billion males with hair growing while you sleep. No one at Gillette has trouble sleeping.\u201dBut 20 years later, management at Gillette (long since acquired by Procter & Gamble) is probably tossing and turning a little more. Gillette\u2019s scale still provides formidable advantages (wide retail distribution, superior patented technology through large R.&D. investment), and its well-known brand (reinforced through mass-media advertising) creates a strong habit in loyal customers acquired early in their lives.However, those advantages are plainly no longer as formidable as they were at the company\u2019s zenith. For an insurgent like Dollar Shave Club, online sales reduce the impact of Gillette\u2019s big lead in drugstore shelf space, and cloud-computing services reduce the required upfront technology investment. Targeted direct marketing on Facebook and other social channels obviates the need for a mass-media campaign, while customer reviews and word-of-mouth can spread the word. At the high end, Gillette\u2019s patented, multi-blade, vibrating razor is a tough opponent, so naturally new entrants focus on the entry level \u2014 where they can rebrand cheap, no-name blades to compete.In Jet\u2019s case, the serial entrepreneur Marc Lore was able to build a large e-commerce company for a few hundred million dollars in just a couple of years by taking an innovative approach to pricing and distribution. And Walmart is plainly convinced that Jet\u2019s expertise and momentum will help it compete with Amazon. Jet\u2019s negative gross margins, which would have required large continuing investments, will disappear when combined with Walmart\u2019s purchasing and distribution scale.While it is hard to stay ahead solely through superior execution over an extended period, it is sometimes enough in the short term to draw a deep-pocketed buyer where there are strong, immediate synergies. Creating enormous value over the long term requires turning a tactical edge into some form of durable advantage.While there are plenty of extraordinary start-ups creating new markets with a path to genuine advantage, self-described \u201cdisrupters\u201d often find that the same forces that allowed them to get going initially also let in a horde of rivals. Competition drains away profit.This is particularly likely where the \u201cdisruptive innovation\u201d does not greatly change the cost structure or end-user experience. Putting a thin layer of software on a people-intensive service business, for instance, may win some immediate sales against Luddite competitors, but it is not necessarily sustainable, nor will it conjure up fat margins. New and existing competitors can often spiff up their supporting tech, too.As the Columbia Business School Professor Bruce C. Greenwald pointed out in his book \u201cCompetition Demystified,\u201d product differentiation on its own is not the basis for sustainable advantage. In his renowned example, \u201calmost everybody makes toasters\u201d \u2014 and if consumers one day demanded \u201ctoasters that sing when the bread is ready\u201d \u2014 soon every manufacturer would offer a \u201ccrooning toaster.\u201dThe rise of web-fueled competition is plainly inexorable. Computers are infinitely patient and accurate in comparing prices and opportunities, and now companies can provide a complete set of services to atomize the fixed costs formerly required for market entry.However, despite the threat to profits, there is no cause for gloom. Superior tactical execution can still create real value, particularly where it provides ammunition for a bigger war (like Walmart\u2019s battle with Amazon). And in the long term, value is created not by disruption, but by weaving together advantages (as both Amazon and Walmart have done in different ways) that together create a barrier that is hard to storm.Jeremy G.

The play has become an overnight blockbuster, selling more than two million hardcover copies in the first 48 hours, Scholastic said on Wednesday, calling the sales \u201cunprecedented for a script book.\u201dThe play, which is being billed as the eighth book in the Harry Potter series, is a continuation of the story, but also with a stark departure in style and form. It was written by the playwright Jack Thorne, with input from the creator of the series, J. K. Rowling, and the play\u2019s director, John Tiffany. The plot unfolds 19 years after the Battle of Hogwarts, when an adult Harry Potter, now a father and a civil servant working at the Ministry of Magic, sees his own children off to Hogwarts.The publication coincided with the opening of the play in London, which drew rapturous reviews from theater critics and fans.But the book, which arrives nearly a decade after Ms. Rowling officially ended the series, has already caused a minor schism among devoted Potterheads. While many readers were ecstatic about the chance to have more material on Harry and his friends, others have faulted Ms. Rowling for licensing out her story and characters. Some fans have lashed out online, saying they feel they were duped and misled by the prominence of Ms. Rowling\u2019s name on the cover.\u201cThis is NOT a Harry Potter book I frankly feel disgusted even adding it to the collection,\u201d one disappointed fan wrote on Amazon. \u201cIt reads like a poorly written fan fiction.\u201dFor Scholastic, the Harry Potter books have been a reliable cash cow, with more than 160 million copies sold in the United States and more than 450 million copies sold worldwide. In the fiscal quarter ending on May 31, Scholastic\u2019s children\u2019s trade sales rose 12 percent in the fourth quarter and 14 percent for the year overall, \u201clargely due to strength in core publishing, both frontlist and backlist, and its Harry Potter franchise,\u201d the company said.The sales of \u201cCursed Child\u201d are a testament to the longevity of the franchise, though they fell far short of the sales record set in 2007 by \u201cHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,\u201d the seventh book in the series. \u201cDeathly Hallows\u201d sold 8.3 million copies in the United States during its first 24 hours on sale.Some fans hoped that Ms. Rowling, who has moved on to publishing fiction for adults, might bring Harry out of retirement and write more novels.

The company, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, also earned more money from vendors, who pay to sell and advertise their goods on its sites.The company said sales rose 59 percent in the first quarter to $4.8 billion. Its operating profit rose 71 percent to $1.3 billion.For many American investors, Alibaba is seen as a proxy for the health of the Chinese economy and the strength of its consumers. The company has outperformed the broader retail market in China. It has also been investing in the growth of e-commerce in the country \u2014 focusing on logistics and on rural areas where fewer people are online \u2014 so it can continue to grow even as the country\u2019s economy slows.The company is also working hard to brace itself for a further slowdown in China, pushing out of its conventional online shopping business into cloud computing, entertainment through online video and gaming, and even a food delivery business. Those long-term efforts have had mixed results. Results this quarter, for instance, showed that the company\u2019s smartphone-based food delivery business, Koubei, continued to burn cash competing with rivals.Yet other sectors have been more promising. Alibaba\u2019s cloud computing service, which is similar to the one offered by Amazon, has quickly gained traction in China, where businesses have been relying on Alibaba for computing power.Alibaba\u2019s gross merchandise volume, a closely watched measure of the transactions on the company\u2019s websites, grew 24 percent compared with the same period a year earlier, about the same pace as the prior quarter.Investors bid Alibaba\u2019s shares up more than 2 percent in premarket trading on the results.The underlying assumption that slowing growth in China will eventually hurt Alibaba\u2019s sales has focused more attention on its other businesses. During its recent investor day, Alibaba said it would start to offer more information on its efforts in sectors like entertainment and food delivery.\u201cWe have already started to see early signs of business breakthroughs in new categories and some of its burgeoning growth assets,\u201d Evan Zhou, a Credit Suisse analyst, wrote in a recent report.Yet those new breakthroughs come with risk. In the cloud computing sector, Alibaba has to contend with foreign rivals, and it faces a domestic challenge from the search engine Baidu. Its food delivery business risks becoming a drain on earnings, as many similar companies fight to gain customers by offering big commissions to drivers.Alibaba has also recently increased its focus on international expansion. While much of its efforts are centered on bringing foreign vendors to sell to Chinese consumers \u2014 and in turn spending marketing dollars on Alibaba\u2019s platforms \u2014 the company has also made bets on e-commerce in neighboring developing markets.The company invested in the Indian commerce companies Paytm and Snapdeal, and this year, it made its largest overseas acquisition, paying $1 billion to take over Lazada, a popular Southeast Asian shopping website.videoAdvertisement"}

That\u2019s one of several things that often makes China\u2019s market unique in the world, along with a strong nationalist streak, local innovation and good old-fashioned protectionism.Whichever of these you consider paramount, they create a strangely familiar outcome in Uber\u2019s decision to sell its China operations to Didi Chuxing, the local version of Uber\u2019s ride-hailing service.In the business of technology infrastructure, China has also been a tough market. Cisco Systems manages to sell some products, but it has lost much business to Huawei, a Chinese maker of internet gear. Cisco once sued Huawei, accusing it of copying Cisco\u2019s stuff, but it now says relations are fine. They are, except Huawei executives privately fume at the difficulties they have entering the American market.The way Cisco and Huawei dominate their home markets and the way local Chinese cloud companies are likely to have a big role in China but little elsewhere for now suggest a likely fate for Didi-Uber: The Chinese company gets its big market, and the Americans get theirs, and much of the world besides. Don\u2019t expect to see a big push by Didi in, say, Europe, where Uber already has operations.For now. After all, China is a huge market.

{"Headline": "Letter of Recommendation: Safety Razors", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "Supported byLetter of RecommendationThe first razor I can remember owning is one I received as a present for my 18th birthday. It came in the mail from Gillette. I don\u2019t know how the company knew, but I was happy to be in its database. The Fusion, with its novel five-blade design, had recently hit the market. I was thrilled, and I cycled back and forth through the cartridges until they were all hair-\u00adclogged and uselessly dull. When I found out the price of a Fusion blade-\u00adrefill box, I saw my whole life stretch in front of me.For years I got used to two sad sights: a set of overused Gillette cartridges in the bathroom cabinet and my scruffy face in the mirror. It wasn\u2019t just the cost that made me resent the Fusion. The razor\u2019s shining plastic felt nice when I was a teenager, but into my 20s it still looked like the kind of product that only a teenager would be proud to own. The handle has all the heft of a Happy Meal toy.Shaving cartridges are so beloved in business circles that the strategy has its own name: the \u201crazor and blades\u201d model. You give away something free, or below cost, in order to get consumers hooked on the refills. Keurig K-Cups and Swiffers, for example. Not only are they ripoffs, but they\u2019re also incredibly wasteful, both in terms of packaging and the marketing required to make us forget, for example, that mops exist. Other times, they\u2019re all but unavoidable, as with smartphones (with their expensive data plans) and printers (with their extortionate ink refills).Cartridge razors are the incorrect answer to a common eighth-grade algebra problem: the cost equation. These typically compare two imaginary products, one with a high upfront cost and a low variable cost, the other the opposite. Their lesson (beyond how to find where lines intersect on a graph) is that for a consumer it\u2019s usually better to pay now for an expensive handle, not forever-\u00adafter for expensive blades. So three years ago, I went online and spent $33 on a Merkur Safety Razor 23C.It wasn\u2019t meant to be this way. King Camp Gillette introduced his safety razor, with disposable double-\u00adedge blades, around the turn of the 20th century. But before he was an inventor, Gillette was a starry-\u00adeyed utopian socialist. In 1894, he published \u201cThe Human Drift,\u201d a book that, among other things, envisioned most of the population of North America living in a huge metropolis powered by Niagara Falls. Production would be fully centralized, making for the greatest efficiency, while all goods would be free to everyone. That\u2019s the only way Gillette saw to ensure that the benefits of technological development would be shared. \u201cNo system can ever be a perfect system, and free from incentive for crime,\u201d he wrote, employing a prescient metaphor, \u201cuntil money and all representative value of material is swept from the face of the earth.\u201d His blade was a model socialist innovation: Gillette replaced toilsome sharpening labor with the smallest, most easily produced part imaginable. The very existence of the Gillette Fusion is an insult to his memory.To maintain growth, today\u2019s Gillette has to keep coming up with gimmicks, even sometimes at the expense of the truth. In 2005, a Federal District Court found that some of the company\u2019s ad claims about its vibrating M3 Power razor \u2014 that \u201cmicropulses\u201d lift hair up and away from the skin, allowing for a closer shave \u2014 were \u201cliterally false.\u201d King Camp imagined a modern world where each innovation would yield more luxury and freedom for everyone. Instead, his name represents a company that sells us increasingly absurd instruments as though they\u2019re the exclusive option for personal grooming. Advertisers pulled off an incredible coup by convincing us that the manliest choice is one that shields us from sharp objects.I use my Merkur every morning, letting its hefty handle warm in the sink. And every day, I use a fresh Astra blade. It\u2019s the kind of efficient extravagance I think King Camp might appreciate. Gillette, the company, actually bought Astra \u2014 a Czech company \u2014 in 1996 in order to expand its business in Eastern Europe. Now Astra has been swallowed up by Procter & Gamble, which acquired Gillette in 2005. On shaving forums and Reddit, users discuss stockpiling thousands of double-\u00adedge blades in anticipation of P.&G.\u2019s eventual success and the triumph of capitalist waste. Until then, King Camp Gillette\u2019s dream holds on by the thinnest margin.Malcolm Harris is a freelance writer and a columnist at Pacific Standard.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Join the Army and Choose Whichever God You Like", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "Supported byEvery August, the oldest synagogue in the United States celebrates the fact that George Washington hated tolerance.In 1790, a couple of months after Rhode Island became the last state to ratify the Constitution, Moses Seixas of Touro Synagogue in Newport wrote his president a nice note about what a relief it was to live in a republic \u201cdeeming every one, of whatever Nation, tongue, or language, equal parts of the great governmental Machine.\u201dWashington replied to Seixas and his brethren, \u201cIt is now no more that toleration is spoken of, as if it was by the indulgence of one class of people, that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights.\u201d Tolerance, he meant, was small, petty and obsolete because they lived in a big new country where citizens stood side by side. For the United States government, he wrote, \u201cgives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance.\u201d He added, \u201cEvery one shall sit in safety under his own vine and figtree, and there shall be none to make him afraid.\u201dPause here for a century or two until \u201cevery one\u201d actually includes everyone. While we wait, it\u2019s worth remembering that colonial Rhode Island had attracted so many Jews, Quakers, Baptists and other denominations because non-Puritans were persecuted in neighboring Massachusetts. And that in 1774, the First Continental Congress almost fell apart in its first five minutes because a couple of Episcopalians refused to pray with a bunch of shifty Quakers and Congregationalists.So it was a civil rights landmark when the first American president publicly invited non-Christians to join him on equal footing on the First Amendment\u2019s front porch. Now, after Khizr Khan appeared on national television offering to lend Donald J. Trump a paperback Constitution he had pulled out of his jacket, thereby turning the pocket Constitution into an Amazon best seller, next Sunday\u2019s annual reading of Washington\u2019s letter at Touro Synagogue is sure to crackle with newsy excitement.A few months before Washington wrote to the Touro Jews, he confided to a British historian: \u201cI walk on untrodden ground. There is scarcely any part of my conduct which may not hereafter be drawn into precedent.\u201d Because he was all too aware of inventing the presidency, the letter addressed to the Rhode Island synagogue is also addressed to us. As the first president, which is to say the first executive with the job of preserving, protecting and defending the Constitution, he was making a blunt statement on what he believed that Constitution was supposed to be about.While Washington was enough of a republican to throw in with the Continental Congress from the get-go, eight years commanding the Continental Army transformed him. When he arrived in Boston to take charge of the gathered militias, he wrote a snooty letter to a Virginia crony complaining of \u201can unaccountable kind of stupidity in the lower class of these people, which, believe me, prevails but too generally among the officers of the Massachusetts part of the Army.\u201dThen Boston\u2019s Henry Knox volunteered to go to Fort Ticonderoga in New York to fetch its stash of cannons, mortars and howitzers, which he dragged back over the Berkshires. In winter! The British occupying Boston took one look at that fearsome artillery pointing down at them and high-tailed it to Canada. And the Massachusetts part of the Army suddenly struck Washington as a lot less stupid.Similarly, in February of 1777, Washington fired off a bitter missive to Congress complaining about the \u201cevil\u201d of unemployed French soldiers who had washed ashore expecting to steal American officers\u2019 jobs. Nine months later, Washington wrote to Congress suggesting that they let the freakishly brave Frenchman Lafayette command his own division.In Washington\u2019s farewell orders to his troops in 1783, he marveled \u201cthat Men who came from the different parts of the Continent, strongly disposed, by the habits of education, to despise and quarrel with each other, would instantly become but one patriotic band of Brothers.\u201dCivilians envy this. I have qualms about the Spanish-American War \u2014 who doesn\u2019t? But I wolfed down the part of Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s book \u201cThe Rough Riders\u201d portraying the men he commanded in Cuba: sheriffs and sharpshooters, Creeks and Chickasaws, a Louisiana bookworm, an Idaho hunter, a Jew nicknamed Pork-chop and a cowpuncher who went by \u201cthe Dude,\u201d all living together in \u201ccomplete equality.\u201dThe last time Ghazala Khan spoke to her son Humayun, an Army captain, before he was killed in action in Iraq, he waved off her pleas to avoid heroics and stay safe, she said. \u201cMom,\u201d he told her, \u201cthese are my soldiers, these are my people. I have to take care of them.\u201dIt was heartening to read the letter signed by 50 Republican national security officials who announced on Monday, \u201cNone of us will vote for Donald Trump.\u201d Among their reasons: \u201cHe appears to lack basic knowledge about and belief in the U.S. Constitution.\u201dOne of the signers, who has served in every Republican presidential administration since Nixon\u2019s, stands out as having the most Republican name since Henry Cabot Lodge: William Howard Taft IV. He is the great-grandson of the Republican overachiever who was our 27th president and our 10th chief justice. So while every Republican stalwart on the list has my respect for abandoning their party\u2019s nominee, I would imagine it took extra guts for Mr. Taft to add his family name to the list of mutineers.Yet by breaking with Mr. Trump on constitutional grounds, Mr. Taft is not a Taftian turncoat, but is rather harking back to his forebears\u2019 roots in the party of Lincoln.Mr. Taft\u2019s great-great-grandfather Alphonso Taft was a delegate to the first Republican National Convention, back in 1856. On the Cincinnati Superior Court in 1870, Judge Taft weighed in during the \u201cCincinnati Bible Wars,\u201d a series of public quarrels and court cases about whether the Protestant King James Bible was the appropriate go-to spiritual reference in a school district also serving Catholics and Jews. In one case, Board of Education of Cincinnati v. Minor, Judge Taft asserted in an opinion that the Bill of Rights protected \u201cevery sect.\u201d Expounding on freedom of religion in general, he declared, \u201cthe idea, that a man has less conscience because he is a Rationalist, or a Spiritualist, or even an Atheist, than the believer in any one of the accepted forms of faith, may be current, but it is not a constitutional idea, in the State of Ohio.\u201dThe Republican old guard will spend the coming years trying to figure out how to salvage the moral foundation built by original delegates like Great-great-grandfather Taft while warding off barmy xenophobes. Perhaps the party should start requiring potential presidential candidates to take a test about the meaning and mechanics of the Constitution. Such a test exists.

{"Headline": "Apple, Congress and the Missing Taxes", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "Supported byEditorialApple and the United States are crying foul over the ruling in Europe that Apple received illegal tax breaks from Ireland and must hand over 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion), a record tax penalty in Europe.But Apple and the United States have only themselves to blame for the situation.Initially, deferral was a convenience for multinationals, as they sought investment opportunities abroad. Today, it is the taproot of global tax avoidance. Financial engineering has let American companies shift profits into foreign accounts, while they lobby Congress for tax-rate cuts in exchange for repatriating the money. Currently, there is some $2 trillion in corporate profits in offshore tax-deferred accounts; besides Apple, Microsoft, Google, Cisco and Oracle also have large stashes. Apple is one of nearly two dozen major corporations pushing Congress for a \u201ctax holiday,\u201d which would let companies bring back foreign-held money over the course of a year at a discounted tax rate, rather than the current rate, 35 percent.Before the European ruling on Tuesday, the debate over a tax holiday had pitted Republicans, who have generally favored the idea, against Democrats, who have viewed it as an unjustified reward for tax avoidance. The Democrats have history on their side. A tax holiday in 2005 lowered the corporate rate to 5.25 percent, enticing corporations to repatriate some $300 billion. It was billed as a way to create jobs and increase investment, but the money was used mostly for dividend payments, share buybacks (which tend to raise executive pay) and severance for laid-off employees. Worse, the tax holiday inspired multinationals to stash as much money abroad as they possibly could in anticipation of another holiday.The European ruling, however, could sharply alter the terms of the congressional debate. Republicans and Democrats alike have always assumed that foreign-held profits would one day be repatriated. The big question was the rate at which they would ultimately be taxed. Similarly, the Treasury assumes that deferred foreign profits will one day be taxed when it projects future revenues \u2014 an important measure of the nation\u2019s fiscal health.But the money won\u2019t be repatriated and taxed under American law if Europeans, in the course of enforcing their own laws against tax havens, get their hands on it first. And that, in a nutshell, is why members of Congress and Treasury officials are so upset about the Apple ruling. They understand, correctly, that tax-law enforcement in Europe could reduce the sums they expect to collect taxes on someday. What they don\u2019t understand, or aren\u2019t saying, is that they brought the problem on themselves.The way forward is not to declare a tax war with Europe. It is for Congress to agree on a way to tax foreign-held corporate profits. President Obama put forth a reasonable approach in 2015, when he proposed a mandatory 14 percent tax on multinationals\u2019 current offshore profits \u2014 whether they are repatriated or not \u2014 and, thereafter, a new minimum tax rate of 19 percent on profits moved offshore. An even better approach would be to simply end indefinite corporate tax deferral, imposing American taxes on profits when they are made.Republicans rejected Mr. Obama\u2019s proposal in 2015, and there is no chance that lawmakers will engage in such a debate so close to the election. But the next president and Congress will need to act to ensure that at long last, American corporations pay their fair share in taxes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Brazil, Where Men\u2019s Soccer Once Was King, the Women\u2019s Game Rules", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "Supported bySports of The TimesMANAUS, Brazil \u2014 Late Tuesday evening, as the Amazon temperature danced at 90 degrees with humidity in step, Janine van Wyk, a defender with South Africa\u2019s women\u2019s soccer team, paused just a second to take in the packed and throbbing Amaz\u00f4nia Arena, filled with 43,000 gloriously nuts fans.She thought to herself, \u201cThis is amazing, to realize that all these people are supporting the women\u2019s game,\u201d she told me later. \u201cThis lets younger girls everywhere know our sport is growing.\u201dShe flashed a quick smile even though her team had just been knocked out of the Olympic tournament.The wheels of change are turning in what Brazilians freely describe as their macho society. Their men\u2019s team collapsed in a heap in the World Cup two years ago and continues to play with a listlessness and diffidence in these Olympics. (Manauaras, the locals here, say the male players \u201care walking on high heels,\u201d which means, roughly and after consultation with eminent linguists, \u201carrogant snots.\u201d)The women\u2019s game \u2014 the Brazilian women in particular, but with applause left over for foreign teams as well \u2014 has captured the collective imagination here. As a colleague, Tania Franco, and I wandered around Manaus before the game, and later as we walked through the stands, the sense was that this nation\u2019s enraptured, besotted relationship with soccer had finally lapped over onto the women\u2019s side.Much of this is owed to the Brazilian women\u2019s players, who kick and run with an artful joie de vivre, offering ankle-breaking stutter steps and swashbuckling kicks. Marta, the ponytailed star long known as the Pel\u00e9 of the women\u2019s game, spent too much of her career as a soccer prophet without much honor in her own country. Now she hears loud applause every time her foot touches the ball.15 PhotosWe came upon Danyelle Christine da Silva Beleza, 14, standing and jumping and cheering in this stadium, which was built at fantastical cost and sits like a massive white orb astride northern Manaus. Her family and their neighbors\u2019 family had taken two cars and driven from Rond\u00f4nia to Manaus for this game. That sounds easy enough; a map shows mileage roughly equivalent to the seven-and-a-half-hour trip from New York City to Cleveland. Except that they traversed a \u201chighway\u201d that had been closed for 30 years and that remained a dirt track through the Amazon jungle. The two families bounced and jostled for 14 hours.No matter. They wanted to see the women play.\u201cBrazil is a macho-man society; it is wonderful this is changing,\u201d Danyelle said, beaming. \u201cI want Marta\u2019s jersey instead of Neymar\u2019s.\u201dAs it happened, the Brazilian women could not deliver a grand victory on Tuesday night. The South African women, by their own admission playing over their heads in the drive-a-stake-through-the-eye heat, held the Brazilians to a 0-0 tie.A similar fate befell the favored American women in their game here on Tuesday as the Colombian women, riding two brilliant free kicks by Catalina Usme, a striker with a ponytail Mohawk, tied the score at 2-2.Both games were accompanied by asterisks. The Brazilian and American teams were already assured of spots in the next round, and their coaches were not willing to watch key players melt into puddles in the Amazonian heat. So some key players sat; others played part of the game. Marta played only in the second half, and only because another player came up lame at halftime.\u201cI wanted to spare Marta this heat,\u201d the Brazilian coach, Vad\u00e3o, said. \u201cIf I got her hurt here. \u2026\u201dHe allowed that thought to trail off unspoken, no doubt figuring that had Marta gone down, he\u2019d have had to take up residency under an assumed name in a distant corner of the Amazon.The American coach, Jill Ellis, offered a wry, are-you-kidding look when asked if her players had slowed toward the end of their game. \u201cYeah, I would challenge anyone to run around in that heat,\u201d she said.Solo tried to backtrack. She began tweeting photos of the sunset over the Amazon. That fooled no one. She has been jeered since the Olympics began, and a boom of boos lowered on her every time she touched the ball on Tuesday. As she ran off the field at the half, she was washed over by chants of \u201cZika! Zika!\u201dChristiane Luizedo was one of those lustful booers. \u201cWe know that some people see Brazil as a third-world country,\u201d she said. \u201cShe has disrespected our nation. Now she has to deal with the consequences.\u201dThat Solo had one of the worst games of her career was occasion for paroxysms of joy. Although, in truth, that anger did not feel deep. More striking was the newfound support for the women. Wandering through downtown Manaus, a place of pastel-colored, colonial-age buildings and perpetually busy markets that is ringed by a forest of office towers, I heard again and again a respect mixed with chagrin that fans had taken so long to embrace the women\u2019s game.Renato Andrade da Silva, a cabdriver, had the Olympics playing on a tiny screen in his cab as he hurtled through traffic. That night\u2019s game was must-see television.\u201cThe women are such a great surprise, and the men, not so much,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to like the men more; that was my mistake.\u201dAt a cafe in a baroque old opera house, I spoke with the barista Marcelo Gadhella, 30. \u201cThe women should be given a lot more credit,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the men deserve less credit.\u201dAt a nearby table, Karen Marinho, 25, nodded. She is an aspiring archaeologist and loves the women\u2019s game. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of women nowadays who go to watch, and they bring their spouses,\u201d she said. \u201cThe macho men say: \u2018Oh! Now the women play like little men.\u2019\u201dShe rolled her eyes. More money, she said, needs to go into promotion and player development. The women\u2019s championship games run only on obscure cable channels; the men\u2019s game is on all public channels.Vad\u00e3o, the Brazilian coach, noted that his team took a cheap flight to Manaus, which is four hours by air from Rio de Janeiro. There was no food, and his players were crowded in economy.Such problems are not unique to Brazil. American female players have filed suit seeking pay equity with the less successful American men\u2019s national team. Players in women\u2019s leagues in Europe and elsewhere remain distinct second-class citizens, their games underpublicized and spottily attended.Perhaps Tuesday evening\u2019s double bill offered a window into a better future. Such was the view of Vera Pauw, the lithe Dutch woman who coaches the South African team. She came to the interview room with jaw set grim, her Olympic road at an end. Then she spoke of the artistry of the Brazilians and of the grit of her team, and especially of all those cheering fans.\u201cBrazil showcased a very mature women\u2019s play and pace; it was beautiful,\u201d she said. \u201cNow we know what we could do with a professional league in South Africa.\u201dShe smiled at herself. People, she said, will tell you that she is not one to gush. She could not help herself. \u201cTo see a huge stadium filled, with fans behind every women\u2019s kick, was fantastic,\u201d she said.That is an Amazonian reverie right there.Email: powellm@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chip Technology Keeps Checked Luggage in Check", "Date": "2016-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byItinerariesOn a recent Southwest Airlines flight from Baltimore, Shvilla Rasheem arrived in Indianapolis, but her luggage did not.Ms. Rasheem, a 34-year-old consultant, said she always checks her bag when flying on Southwest because there is no fee. \u201cI never thought of the possibility that I would not get my luggage,\u201d she said.She had good reason not to worry. Statistics compiled by Sita, an aviation technology company, show a steadily decreasing likelihood of bags going astray.Last year had the lowest rate of wayward luggage \u2014 6.5 bags per 1,000 \u2014 in the dozen years Sita has been keeping track.Various advances in technology and bag-handling procedures deserve credit, including improvements over the years in the bar-coded tags and optical scanners that have long been in use for identifying and sorting checked luggage. But optical-scanning systems have their limits, and the airline industry has been slow to adopt methods used by other industries that need to track items through the shipping process.Where bar-coded tags fall short is if the tag is wrinkled, smudged or torn, or not in line of sight of the scanner. If the tag is not readable, the bag can get lost without being noticed \u2014 which could be why no one was aware that Ms. Rasheem\u2019s bag did not get loaded onto her flight.Bar code readers have a \u201cread rate\u201d of 80 to 95 percent of baggage tags, according to Nick Gates, a director at Sita responsible for baggage technology. \u201cIf you can improve the read rate of bag tags,\u201d Mr. Gates said, \u201cthere is less chance the bag will be delayed as it moves through the airport.\u201dThat is why the airline industry and some airport managers are intent on improving the tracking rate by looking beyond the 30-year-old baggage bar code. They are adopting tags that do not need to be seen to be read.Delta Air Lines has installed a system using bar-code tags that also have an embedded radio frequency identification, or R.F.I.D., chip. Such chips can store travel information and need to be only close to radio scanners along the way for the bag\u2019s progress to be recorded. As with Delta\u2019s older barcode tags, fliers will be able to use the airline\u2019s travel app to keep track of their bags.\u201cThis is the next step in reliability,\u201d said Rodney Brooks, general manager of airport operations at Delta.Air France, the German airline Lufthansa and Qantas of Australia are among those that have experimented with radio chip luggage tags. But adoption has lagged at airlines in the United States \u2014 which could change, with Delta\u2019s decision.The airline is spending $50 million on the necessary scanners, printers and radio tags, which also use bar codes and look little different from conventional bar-code tags. The system is now in place at all of the 344 airports into which Delta flies and is expected to be operational by the end of this month.Though still fairly novel in airline applications, R.F.I.D. technology is hardly new. It has been used for decades to keep track of shipments of merchandise, which is why many people wonder why it has not already been adopted by airlines, said Ryan Ghee, editor of FutureTravelExperience.com.\u201cLook at online retailing like Amazon and the logistics industry,\u201d Mr. Ghee said. \u201cPeople ordered something and could have it delivered immediately to where they wanted it to go. Every step on the journey they could see, \u2018Where is my parcel?\u2019 People got used to that.\u201dWidespread adoption of radio chip tags in the air travel industry has not been easy to achieve, despite the efforts of the International Air Transport Association, a trade group. It has set a deadline of summer 2018 when all 265 member airlines should be able to track and fully trace bags \u2014 not only on their own flights, but also when passengers connect to other carriers.\u201cIt won\u2019t matter what technology they choose,\u201d said Nick Careen, an executive with the association, as long as bags can be tracked once they leave the traveler\u2019s hands and traced if they are missing.Airline bag tracking is difficult for a number of reasons. Updating to the latest technology requires infrastructure changes that can be expensive and disruptive. And because most airports leave it to each airline to handle its own bag-checking system, the technology and procedures vary widely.McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas is an exception, having decided as part of a renovation in 2005 to become fully capable of incorporating radio chips into the bag-checking and sorting system, which the airport runs.The radio chips embedded in the paper tags being used in Las Vegas ensure that checked suitcases move more quickly and accurately through the system and increase the likelihood that the bags make it onto the right airplanes.\u201cR.F.I.D. runs for us day in and day out very, very accurately \u2014 99.5 percent accuracy,\u201d said Samuel G. Ingalls, the airport\u2019s assistant director of information systems. The airport has handled 160 million chip-tagged bags in the last 10 years.There are many ways airlines and airports can use radio chips. In 2010, when Qantas became one of the first airlines to start using the technology, it sold a hard plastic reusable baggage tag for $60. A spokesman said 1.5 million tags were in circulation.Customers \u201clike the speed of checking in and the sense of control and recognition that comes with having their own permanent tag,\u201d said Phil Capps, Qantas\u2019s head of product and service development.Delta\u2019s single-use paper tags, like the ones in at McCarran, are much cheaper, at just pennies apiece.Accurate bag handling can save an airline the size of Delta a lot of money. Last year, it mishandled about 276,000 of the 120 million passenger bags it transported, according to statistics that it reported to the Department of Transportation. While that misfire rate \u2014 0.23 percent \u2014 is well below the international average of 0.65 percent for mishandled bags, it still adds up to a lot of unhappy customers.Even one passenger\u2019s bad experience can become a big embarrassment for an airline, given the effect of social media. During the day Ms. Rasheem was separated from her bag, which contained notes for a presentation she was to give, she tweeted her frustration \u2014 not just to Southwest but also to her 1,500 followers on Twitter.Ms. Rasheem\u2019s notes and clothes arrived before her conference began, with no explanation about what had happened.Southwest said it was still exploring what bag handling options it will use to meet the new target of the International Air Transport Association.While the airlines work toward a tracking standard, various vendors have rushed in with disparate versions of bags, tags and apps \u2014 some working in partnership with airlines. Rimowa, a German maker of luxe luggage, has an e-ink bar code and radio chip permanently affixed to the suitcases it sells. Passengers using the bags on Lufthansa flights can speed through check-in.\u201cWhenever you come with such a bag already tagged, you can place it on the bag drop belt and it will be checked automatically,\u201d said Bj\u00f6rn Becker, a senior director at Lufthansa who oversees ground and digital services.Whatever approach the airlines take, Mr. Careen of the air transport association echoes the sentiments of travelers like Ms. Rasheem when he says fliers should \u201cknow at all times where their bag is.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Viacom, Now Comes the Hard Part", "Date": "2016-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the summer of 1987, Sumner M. Redstone wrested control of Viacom in a hostile corporate takeover that left scorched relationships with the company\u2019s management. Still bitter, executives sent Thomas E. Dooley, Viacom\u2019s 30-year-old treasurer, to greet Mr. Redstone when he visited the Viacom office, the new boss wearing a plaid jacket bought on his way, the Filene\u2019s Basement price tag still visible.On Friday, Viacom elevated Mr. Dooley to interim chief executive from chief operating officer. He was appointed as Viacom announced that the embattled Philippe P. Dauman had stepped down as chief executive, with a severance package valued at about $72 million. (Since being named chief executive of Viacom in 2006, Mr. Dauman\u2019s total reported compensation was $409.7 million even as the company has struggled in recent years.)With a truce declared in the battle for control of the 93-year-old Mr. Redstone\u2019s companies, a harsh spotlight now is focused on Viacom\u2019s struggling business. The company, which owns the MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon cable television networks and the Paramount Pictures film and television studio, has had a nearly 50 percent plunge in its share price in the last two years.This was the company that ignited the careers of Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, brought to life characters like SpongeBob SquarePants and Dora the Explorer and had generations demanding the music videos of MTV.But in recent years, the company has been overshadowed by popular digital outlets like Netflix, Amazon and Snapchat and plagued by weak ratings and declines in advertising sales across several of its TV networks. At the same time, its film studio has delivered dismal results. \u201cBen Hur,\u201d Paramount\u2019s production with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, is expected to be yet another box-office disappointment.The resolution to the legal dispute left investors and analysts with a list of questions about the fate of Viacom: Would the company pursue a sale of Paramount? Will the Redstones push to reunite Viacom with CBS after the two companies split a decade ago? Will the genial Mr. Dooley, who is interim chief executive through Sept. 30, take on the chief executive title permanently?\u201cYou and I are buying a house together, and it is called a fixer-upper, darling,\u201d Mario Gabelli, whose investment firm, Gamco, is the second-largest voting shareholder in Viacom and CBS, said in an interview when discussing the state of the company.\u201cThe main question is, what is Shari going to do?\u201d added Mr. Gabelli, who said that he had met with Ms. Redstone twice in the last 12 months.The settlement, which Viacom\u2019s board approved Thursday night, firmly put the fate of the company under the control of Mr. Redstone, who is in failing health, and his daughter. The board of National Amusements, the private theater chain company through which Mr. Redstone controls about 80 percent of the voting shares in Viacom and CBS, met later and approved the deal.\u201cThe agreement serves the best interests of Viacom, its shareholders, and you, our employees, and it paves the way for our future,\u201d Mr. Dooley said in a memo to the Viacom staff on Friday. \u201cI know we all share a desire to guide the company through this transition in the best possible way.\u201dThe settlement makes way for Viacom\u2019s board to expand to include the five new directors that National Amusements put forward in June. They include Nicole Seligman, a former Sony executive and lawyer who represented President Bill Clinton during his impeachment trial; and Kenneth Lerer, a venture capitalist, a co-founder of The Huffington Post and chairman of BuzzFeed.Mr. Dooley, who started at Viacom in 1980, is expected to work closely with the new board during the next month and a half to develop a new plan for the struggling company. He is said to want the top job but also is committed to working with the new board through a transition period on whatever outcome is best for the company.Mr. Dooley, a longstanding partner to Mr. Dauman who helped create much of the company\u2019s strategy in the last several years, has much to prove. In his memo to staff, Mr. Dooley wrote more than 200 words about his close friendship with Mr. Dauman, recognizing and thanking the ousted chief executive.War has spread across the empire of Sumner Redstone, one of the entertainment industry\u2019s most tenacious titans. At stake are the fortunes of his family and confidants, as well as the fate of Viacom and CBS.\u201cHe is a solid guy, with institutional knowledge, but is he a creative guy?\u201d Mr. Gabelli said of Mr. Dooley. \u201cHe is a compromised guy.\u201dMr. Dooley and Viacom\u2019s new board are expected to try to figure out how to reinvigorate the company and change the perception of its current businesses, without the overhang of the public power struggle that impeded business. That includes evaluating programming across the TV networks, new digital distribution methods, the international business and Paramount.Other options include exploring strategic partnerships, asset sales and other merger and acquisition activity.Some investors and analysts have pushed for Viacom and CBS to combine. Michael Nathanson, an analyst with MoffettNathanson Research, said such a deal would cut costs for executive salaries and put \u201ca real programmer in charge of the business,\u201d a reference to Leslie Moonves, CBS\u2019s well-respected chief executive.Yet other analysts said such a deal was unlikely, as the boards of both companies must act in the best interests of all of their shareholders.In addition, the settlement states that Mr. Dauman will stay on as nonexecutive chairman of Viacom until Sept. 13. He will have the opportunity to present his proposal to sell a 49 percent stake in Paramount to the Viacom board. Yet that transaction would require the unanimous approval of the Viacom board and is unlikely to receive the green light.Advertisement"}

The street is teeming with food trucks representing just about every other ethnicity imaginable.It wasn\u2019t always so.Bruno Cardoso, from Bahia, Brazil, has managed Emporium Brasil since it opened as a pastry snack bar 25 years ago.\u201cAugust is a really slow month, but it\u2019s been busier here for a week before the Olympics,\u201d he told us over a Guaran\u00e1 Antarctica, a Brazilian soda made with fruit from the Amazon.Stop by for happy hour: The restaurant is showing the Olympics and serving chicken croquettes with its popular malagueta sauce.But the extent of the celebrations will depend, largely, on Brazil\u2019s performance.Here\u2019s what else is happening:Sound familiar?The weekend looks much the same.There is a little variety: Saturday afternoon could bring with it a rain shower.Saturday Sunday Having a countdown clock on your subway platform might not make the train arrive any sooner, but it\u2019s nice knowing how long you\u2019ll be waiting.You can grab a snack. You can find a bench. Whether the train is two or 10 minutes away, you\u2019re assured that it is eventually coming.Soon, eight stations along the N, Q and R lines will have new clocks that rely on Bluetooth devices.

{"Headline": "Join the Army and Choose Whichever God You Like", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEvery August, the oldest synagogue in the United States celebrates the fact that George Washington hated tolerance.In 1790, a couple of months after Rhode Island became the last state to ratify the Constitution, Moses Seixas of Touro Synagogue in Newport wrote his president a nice note about what a relief it was to live in a republic \u201cdeeming every one, of whatever Nation, tongue, or language, equal parts of the great governmental Machine.\u201dWashington replied to Seixas and his brethren, \u201cIt is now no more that toleration is spoken of, as if it was by the indulgence of one class of people, that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights.\u201d Tolerance, he meant, was small, petty and obsolete because they lived in a big new country where citizens stood side by side. For the United States government, he wrote, \u201cgives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance.\u201d He added, \u201cEvery one shall sit in safety under his own vine and figtree, and there shall be none to make him afraid.\u201dPause here for a century or two until \u201cevery one\u201d actually includes everyone. While we wait, it\u2019s worth remembering that colonial Rhode Island had attracted so many Jews, Quakers, Baptists and other denominations because non-Puritans were persecuted in neighboring Massachusetts. And that in 1774, the First Continental Congress almost fell apart in its first five minutes because a couple of Episcopalians refused to pray with a bunch of shifty Quakers and Congregationalists.So it was a civil rights landmark when the first American president publicly invited non-Christians to join him on equal footing on the First Amendment\u2019s front porch. Now, after Khizr Khan appeared on national television offering to lend Donald J. Trump a paperback Constitution he had pulled out of his jacket, thereby turning the pocket Constitution into an Amazon best seller, next Sunday\u2019s annual reading of Washington\u2019s letter at Touro Synagogue is sure to crackle with newsy excitement.A few months before Washington wrote to the Touro Jews, he confided to a British historian: \u201cI walk on untrodden ground. There is scarcely any part of my conduct which may not hereafter be drawn into precedent.\u201d Because he was all too aware of inventing the presidency, the letter addressed to the Rhode Island synagogue is also addressed to us. As the first president, which is to say the first executive with the job of preserving, protecting and defending the Constitution, he was making a blunt statement on what he believed that Constitution was supposed to be about.While Washington was enough of a republican to throw in with the Continental Congress from the get-go, eight years commanding the Continental Army transformed him. When he arrived in Boston to take charge of the gathered militias, he wrote a snooty letter to a Virginia crony complaining of \u201can unaccountable kind of stupidity in the lower class of these people, which, believe me, prevails but too generally among the officers of the Massachusetts part of the Army.\u201dThen Boston\u2019s Henry Knox volunteered to go to Fort Ticonderoga in New York to fetch its stash of cannons, mortars and howitzers, which he dragged back over the Berkshires. In winter! The British occupying Boston took one look at that fearsome artillery pointing down at them and high-tailed it to Canada. And the Massachusetts part of the Army suddenly struck Washington as a lot less stupid.Similarly, in February of 1777, Washington fired off a bitter missive to Congress complaining about the \u201cevil\u201d of unemployed French soldiers who had washed ashore expecting to steal American officers\u2019 jobs. Nine months later, Washington wrote to Congress suggesting that they let the freakishly brave Frenchman Lafayette command his own division.In Washington\u2019s farewell orders to his troops in 1783, he marveled \u201cthat Men who came from the different parts of the Continent, strongly disposed, by the habits of education, to despise and quarrel with each other, would instantly become but one patriotic band of Brothers.\u201dCivilians envy this. I have qualms about the Spanish-American War \u2014 who doesn\u2019t? But I wolfed down the part of Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s book \u201cThe Rough Riders\u201d portraying the men he commanded in Cuba: sheriffs and sharpshooters, Creeks and Chickasaws, a Louisiana bookworm, an Idaho hunter, a Jew nicknamed Pork-chop and a cowpuncher who went by \u201cthe Dude,\u201d all living together in \u201ccomplete equality.\u201dThe last time Ghazala Khan spoke to her son Humayun, an Army captain, before he was killed in action in Iraq, he waved off her pleas to avoid heroics and stay safe, she said. \u201cMom,\u201d he told her, \u201cthese are my soldiers, these are my people. I have to take care of them.\u201dIt was heartening to read the letter signed by 50 Republican national security officials who announced on Monday, \u201cNone of us will vote for Donald Trump.\u201d Among their reasons: \u201cHe appears to lack basic knowledge about and belief in the U.S. Constitution.\u201dOne of the signers, who has served in every Republican presidential administration since Nixon\u2019s, stands out as having the most Republican name since Henry Cabot Lodge: William Howard Taft IV. He is the great-grandson of the Republican overachiever who was our 27th president and our 10th chief justice. So while every Republican stalwart on the list has my respect for abandoning their party\u2019s nominee, I would imagine it took extra guts for Mr. Taft to add his family name to the list of mutineers.Yet by breaking with Mr. Trump on constitutional grounds, Mr. Taft is not a Taftian turncoat, but is rather harking back to his forebears\u2019 roots in the party of Lincoln.Mr. Taft\u2019s great-great-grandfather Alphonso Taft was a delegate to the first Republican National Convention, back in 1856. On the Cincinnati Superior Court in 1870, Judge Taft weighed in during the \u201cCincinnati Bible Wars,\u201d a series of public quarrels and court cases about whether the Protestant King James Bible was the appropriate go-to spiritual reference in a school district also serving Catholics and Jews. In one case, Board of Education of Cincinnati v. Minor, Judge Taft asserted in an opinion that the Bill of Rights protected \u201cevery sect.\u201d Expounding on freedom of religion in general, he declared, \u201cthe idea, that a man has less conscience because he is a Rationalist, or a Spiritualist, or even an Atheist, than the believer in any one of the accepted forms of faith, may be current, but it is not a constitutional idea, in the State of Ohio.\u201dThe Republican old guard will spend the coming years trying to figure out how to salvage the moral foundation built by original delegates like Great-great-grandfather Taft while warding off barmy xenophobes. Perhaps the party should start requiring potential presidential candidates to take a test about the meaning and mechanics of the Constitution. Such a test exists. Mr. and Mrs. Khan had to pass it to become naturalized citizens of the United States.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the location of Washington and his troops. It was New York City, not Suffolk County, Mass.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Giants Gobble Start-Ups in an Antitrust Blind Spot", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorLike Facebook\u2019s acquisition of WhatsApp, the Walmart deal will probably end up being another example of an upstart internet company being swallowed up to preserve the stranglehold of a giant.This happens because antitrust regulators are stuck in an outdated view of the world, while the internet giants are more attuned to their nascent competitive threats. The deal for Jet.com is just the latest defensive internet acquisition of an emerging start-up that will preserve the hegemony of a select few.And now it is being swallowed up by Walmart.This could be seen as a victory for competition. Walmart will now have a more dynamic management and brand to buttress its own internet sales operation, which trails Amazon by quite a distance. This will allow it to better compete against Amazon. The likely result is that competition in online retailing will eventually be a slugfest between Amazon and Walmart with everyone else thrown by the wayside.The problem with this narrative is that it cements the positions of Walmart and Amazon as the only players in town.This is the modus operandi of the big internet behemoths. They live in fear of new technology disrupting their businesses and killing them off.Mr. Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez was a Facebook product manager when the company faced its greatest threat: Google Plus. Facebook won because it enforced an ethos of all work, all the time, spurred by constant fear of extinction.Facebook and its elite brethren will do anything to make sure they are not the next Yahoo or Radio Shack, killed by disruption and failure to innovate. This translates into paying obscene sums for technology that might challenge their dominance one day.If you don\u2019t believe this, there is a poignant passage in \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d where Mr. Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez notes that Mark Zuckerberg saw that there were two companies with \u201chockey stick growth\u201d that matched Facebook\u2019s own: Instagram and WhatsApp. Both were amassing users at an amazing rate and both were an existential threat to Facebook.Did Mr. Zuckerberg rev up the Facebook machine to try to outcompete them? No. Instead, he bought Instagram for about $1 billion and WhatsApp for an astounding $21.8 billion.Today, Facebook is dominant, with more than 1.7 billion monthly active users. WhatsApp has more than 1 billion monthly active users and Instagram, more than 500 million.Another Google example is YouTube, which was bought for $1.65 billion in 2006 and is now a constant stream of users for Google. Indeed, YouTube, with more than one billion active monthly users, is a top driver of Alphabet\u2019s user growth.Billions of dollars are made in Silicon Valley by selling nascent upstarts to the giants. And the dominant players pay eagerly to remain dominant. That is what is going on with the Jet.com acquisition and perhaps even the $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn by Microsoft.Where are the antitrust authorities in all of this? The guiding standard under the law is that no acquisition should be allowed if it would \u201clessen competition.\u201dUnder the traditional view of antitrust, when Facebook, for example, tries to buy a company like Instagram, it can argue that anyone can start such a website. And there are other competitors like Google and Snapchat. And so this gets past the antitrust authorities, who seem more concerned with how the data will be used rather than the accumulation of users. Both United States and European Union regulators examined the WhatsApp deal, but it passed muster because WhatsApp was viewed as a messenger service, something where there was alternative competition.This misses the point that domination is all about users and views. Those companies with users and page views can dominate, and accumulating those users is everything, something only an infinitesimally small number of companies can find the key to doing.The antitrust system results in the increasing oligopoly that we have, where a few companies dominate major industries, accruing the wealth and power that go with it as potential disrupters are swallowed at birth, the way Cronus, the titan in Greek mythology, ate his young to prevent their uprising.No one knows what might happen to Jet if it remained independent. Perhaps it would fail. Amazon is dominant and Walmart may truly be the only real competitor. The same could be said of any of these acquisitions of high-growth companies. So preventing this acquisition may result not in creating a competitor to Amazon but in the eventual death of Jet. This of course would leave its founder and investors much poorer, a true cost.The flip side of this risk is that the big tech companies continue unchallenged in their dominance. Perhaps it is time to rethink antitrust enforcement, and take the risks associated with a different view of antitrust that looks at potential dominance and at breaking up oligopolies. Rhea protected Zeus from Cronus, which eventually led to Cronus\u2019s destruction.If antitrust authorities do not adapt and emerging competitors continue to be bought up, we should not be surprised of the continued dominance of a very few companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Walmart.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lyft Is Said to Seek a Buyer, Without Success", "Date": "2016-08-19", "News": "Supported byIt is not an easy thing to be an independent ride-hailing company these days.For one, it takes billions of dollars and hundreds of employees to spread to new cities, to market the service and to recruit drivers. Legislators and local laws are often not in your favor. And competitors with deep pockets from all over the world are waiting to cheer if you happen to fail.Lyft, the second-biggest ride-hailing company in the United States behind Uber, is grappling with those forces \u2014 but has found that its options are limited.The company, which is based in San Francisco, has in recent months held talks or made approaches to sell itself to companies including General Motors, Apple, Google, Amazon, Uber and Didi Chuxing, according to a dozen people who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. One person said it was Lyft who was approached by interested parties.Lyft\u2019s discussions were most serious with G.M., which is one of the ride-hailing company\u2019s largest investors. Still, G.M. never made a written offer to buy Lyft, said the people, and in the end, Lyft did not find a buyer.Lyft is not in danger of closing down and has a cash cushion of $1.4 billion, some of these people added, so the company will continue as an independent entity.Still, the talks underline how difficult it has become to operate in the ride-hailing market, where people can book rides from drivers through a smartphone app. While ride-hailing companies do not own fleets of cars and instead rely on drivers who have their own vehicles, the business is highly capital-intensive. Venture capitalists and other investors have poured billions of dollars into the companies.Lyft, a four-year-old company founded by Logan Green and John Zimmer, sprang out of an early long-distance car-pooling program, then called Zimride, in 2007. The goal, the two co-founders have said, was to create a new kind of social ride-sharing, an attempt to decrease the number of cars on the road and to improve congestion, reduce humanity\u2019s environmental footprint and create more efficiency in transportation.That idea has turned into a global movement, as companies worldwide \u2014 like Grab in Southeast Asia, Ola in India, BlaBlaCar in Europe and Uber \u2014 look to upend the global transportation infrastructure.The effort to sell Lyft was aided by bankers at Qatalyst Partners, the boutique investment bank founded by the veteran Silicon Valley banker Frank Quattrone, said the people with knowledge of the talks. Qatalyst declined to comment.Lyft also struggled to find a buyer because of the challenging economics of the ride-hailing business. Companies like Lyft and Uber typically take 20 percent to 25 percent of the cost of each ride. With Lyft drivers expected to pick up an estimated $2 billion or so in fares this year, that meant Lyft\u2019s annual revenue would be about $400 million, according to a person familiar with the company\u2019s financials.That $400 million shrinks after marketing costs are factored in. To win loyalty from drivers who can also work for Uber, Lyft also sometimes lets drivers keep that 20 percent to 25 percent of some rides, so the company effectively earns no revenue in those situations. And in some cases, Lyft provides drivers with additional cash incentives simply to get out on the road, adding to its costs.\u201cOne of the challenges for these companies is to figure out how to grow and sustain that latent demand for these businesses, but also to eventually become profitable,\u201d said Susan Shaheen, co-director of the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cPart of the challenge in evolving those services is just balancing out those factors. And that\u2019s not an easy task.\u201dLyft is not profitable, said a person briefed on the company\u2019s finances. Yet it has a $1.4 billion cash hoard, the person added, and the company thinks that will shield it as it works toward achieving profitability.Ms. Shaheen said an acquisition might still make sense for ride-hailing companies that needed more resources and a bigger size to compete.\u201cThere isn\u2019t a single company that has all of this expertise \u2014 software, manufacturing, ride-sharing \u2014 under one roof,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s where acquisition comes in.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Then, despite your resolve, you break down, pull out the credit card and do something that you promised you wouldn\u2019t.

Gurus tell you to stop looking at Instagram, stay off Facebook, fire all your nonfrugal friends and disown your spendthrift family members. That is an effort to control the stimulus.Then, you\u2019re told to control your response. Most of this advice centers on making it painful to spend. Cut up your credit cards. Use only cash. Track, review and feel bad about your spending.It works until it doesn\u2019t anymore. You can\u2019t ignore all the voices screaming at you to spend, and making spending painful increases the feelings of shame when we do something wrong. It only leads to more spending as a form of self-medicating.Whoa! There is a third element to this little dance with stimulus and response. To break this frustrating spending cycle, we can focus on creating space between the two of them.It starts by acknowledging that the space exists. Most of us don\u2019t even know it\u2019s there. We see a Twitter post about a book someone likes, the post has a link to Amazon, we click the \u201cone click buy\u201d button, and then we own a book with little to no thought.So we need to practice pausing once we\u2019re in that space between. The advice to use cash or to lock up the credit cards can be useful here if it creates space between our desire to buy and our actual buying. It can also be as simple as training ourselves to notice the desire. How does it feel to want something?I didn\u2019t need to bar myself from reading book reviews or allow myself to buy books only with cash. By adding a little space, I gave myself the opportunity to change my response. How you add space is up to you, but once you get good at creating it, then some of the other things matter less.This is just one simple trick to create space. I think you\u2019ll find that by focusing on the space between, you can let go of your anxious grasp on the stimulus and response. If you get the space right, the other two take care of themselves.I\u2019d love to hear from you. What have you done to create space? How has it helped you?Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of an Austrian psychiatrist on second reference. As was correctly noted in the first reference, he is Viktor Frankl, not Frank.Advertisement"}

That\u2019s one of several things that often makes China\u2019s market unique in the world, along with a strong nationalist streak, local innovation and good old-fashioned protectionism.Whichever of these you consider paramount, they create a strangely familiar outcome in Uber\u2019s decision to sell its China operations to Didi Chuxing, the local version of Uber\u2019s ride-hailing service.In the business of technology infrastructure, China has also been a tough market. Cisco Systems manages to sell some products, but it has lost much business to Huawei, a Chinese maker of internet gear. Cisco once sued Huawei, accusing it of copying Cisco\u2019s stuff, but it now says relations are fine. They are, except Huawei executives privately fume at the difficulties they have entering the American market.The way Cisco and Huawei dominate their home markets and the way local Chinese cloud companies are likely to have a big role in China but little elsewhere for now suggest a likely fate for Didi-Uber: The Chinese company gets its big market, and the Americans get theirs, and much of the world besides. Don\u2019t expect to see a big push by Didi in, say, Europe, where Uber already has operations.For now. After all, China is a huge market. When you\u2019ve got 5,000 years of history, it\u2019s easy to play a long game.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Hayden a Boy or Girl? Both. \u2018Post-Gender\u2019 Baby Names Are on the Rise.", "Date": "2016-08-18", "News": "Supported byTheir choice hardly seems unusual in a culture where Heidi Klum, Jessica Simpson and Drew Barrymore have all chosen names for their daughters that could go either way and collectively sound like a frontcourt for the 1962 Detroit Pistons (Lou, for Ms. Klum\u2019s daughter; Maxwell, for Ms. Simpson\u2019s; and Frankie, for Ms. Barrymore\u2019s).The increase was even greater over the last three decades, with the number of unisex baby names having risen 88 percent since 1985.The most popular unisex names in 2015, the researchers found, were Hayden (about 39 percent girls, 61 percent boys) Charlie (about 48 percent girls, 52 percent boys), Emerson (about 60 percent girls, 40 percent boys), Rowan (about 35 percent girls, 65 percent boys), and Finley (about 60 percent girls, 40 percent boys). Rounding out the post-gender Top 10 were River, Dakota, Skyler, Phoenix and Tatum.(For the purposes of the article, Nameberry researchers defined a name as unisex when at least 35 percent of the babies given it were of one sex, and the rest of the other.)Some of the unisex names are novel and could be called the new-parent version of neologisms: Royal, Justice and Phoenix. Others are traditional, and have lost their sex-specific identity over time.Thirty years ago, for example, Tracy was nearly eight times more common for girls than for boys. Last year, there was a nearly 50-50 split between boys and girls named Tracy, according to government data. Similarly, Elliott (in its various spellings) was running almost 100-to-1 in favor of boys years ago; last year, about one Elliott in four was a girl.Other names have seen their gender-specificity eroded more quickly. Boys make up about 38 percent of children named Tatum, but it was 90 percent girls a decade ago, according to Social Security records. Haydens are now about 39 percent girls, up from 11 percent 10 years ago.\u201cThey want their children to grow up and be themselves, free from stereotypes,\u201d she said. \u201cBoys can wear nail polish, girls can ride skateboards. It\u2019s all good.\u201dThe vogue for unisex names is being driven, in part, by millennials, who are in their 20s and early 30s and in their prime child-bearing years. \u201cMillennials are an open-minded and accepting group,\u201d Ms. Murray said, \u201cand they don\u2019t want their children to feel pressured to conform to stereotypes that might be restrictive.\u201dIndeed, marketers have found that gender neutrality is a selling point for millennials raised in an era of growing economic opportunities for women and increasing tolerance for nontraditional gender roles and identities.Raising a child free of gender stereotypes was a goal for Chelsea Marsh, a millennial parent from Fort Wayne, Ind., when she and her husband gave their 6-month-old daughter the either-or name Paris.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go as far as to name my baby girl Jack,\u201d said Ms. Marsh, a 27-year-old sales agent. \u201cBut my goal is to allow her to experience the world without the barriers of pink girlie things. I want her to be strong, play in the dirt and challenge herself to try new things, even if it\u2019s not \u2018what girls do.\u2019\u201d\u201cI would do the same for my son,\u201d she added, \u201cif he wanted to be a dancer instead of a basketball player.\u201dSame-sex parents, whose numbers are growing, may also be inclined to blur traditional gender boundaries.To Yojana Vazquez and her wife, Elaine, choosing the gender-neutral names Kai and Kalo for their twin daughters, now 2, was part of a larger plan to keep gender options open, Ms. Vazquez said.\u201cInstead of always referring to them as our daughters, we say our children or kids,\u201d said Ms. Vazquez, 29, of Springfield, Va. \u201cWe also try to dress them in clothing from all over the children\u2019s department. We mix and match, a pink girlie shirt with a boy\u2019s cargo shorts. A superhero boy\u2019s shirt with a tutu skirt.\u201dThe goal, she said, is \u201cto make sure not to influence them on who they are and, ultimately, who they will grow up to be.\u201dGender-ambiguous names have come into vogue before, Ms. Satran said, first in the 1960s among counterculture types (recall the babies named Sunshine and Rain), and again in the 1980s among baby boomer parents who hoped that giving their daughters names like Blake or Madison would better equip them to take on men in the workplace.Still, unisex baby names account for only a small percentage of those chosen each year. Of the 3.9 million babies born last year, only 1.7 percent were given unisex names, according to Nameberry\u2019s analysis of government data. The most popular baby names in the country continued to be Noah and Liam for boys, and Emma and Olivia for girls.Even so, in an era marked by Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s endlessly publicized transition from Bruce, as well as gender-bending shows like Amazon\u2019s \u201cTransparent,\u201d the unisex baby name may also prove to be in its infancy.\u201cFeminism is cool again, gay marriage is the law of the land and transgender celebrities have come into the mainstream,\u201d said Ms. Satran, the author of 10 baby-name books. \u201cSo who knows?

Facebook was a college social site before it became a global media hub; Amazon was a bookseller before it was, well, everything.Joe MacMillan (Lee Pace), a mysterious, smooth-talking drifter of a businessman, was paired with Gordon Clark (Scoot McNairy), a brilliant but failed engineer, in a sketchy scheme to bring an IBM clone to market. As a plot, it was less than inspiring, and as a character story, less than inspired: an 8-bit Don Draper and a Walter White who dealt in megabytes rather than meth.But at the end of its first season, \u201cHalt\u201d did something almost unheard-of in television, if not in tech: It upended its entire project. With the introduction of the Apple Macintosh, Joe and Gordon discovered that they had been chasing yesterday\u2019s dream. They were thinking too small, too incrementally. The quest of the entire season had been a failure of imagination.The headlines then were about computing power coming to your desktop. But the long-term change, barely glimmering in the days of telephone modems, lay in the connection of every desktop to every other. It was the birth of the social internet, where we now live.Season 2 followed Mutiny, a nascent online gaming company started by Gordon\u2019s wife, Donna (Kerry Bish\u00e9), and Cameron Howe (Mackenzie Davis), an impassioned sparkplug of a programmer.For all practical purposes, the series changed not just its focus but its lead characters. Cameron was visionary but impractical; Donna relished the new start but chafed at being forced into the role of the buzz kill adult in the room. (Ms. Bish\u00e9 gave a nuanced, undersung performance.)This was something we hadn\u2019t seen so often before: a tricky but fruitful alliance between two women in a male-dominated industry. Cameron had the digital native\u2019s instinct to see the online world as a place of constant invention. Donna had the emotional intelligence to notice that Mutiny\u2019s social component \u2014 its chat rooms \u2014 was the future of the future.Season 3, which begins on Tuesday, continues the show\u2019s iterative-learning process, picking up in 1986, as Mutiny has relocated from Texas to Silicon Valley and is beginning to reconceive itself one more time. (Cameron and Donna have noticed their gamers\u2019 taking over Mutiny chat to negotiate real-world trades \u2014 shades of Craigslist or eBay.)The growing pains continue, throwing the women into the unfamiliar and testosterone-heavy world of venture capitalists. \u201cIt only takes one of them to ask you to the dance,\u201d says their consigliere, John Bosworth (Toby Huss). Cameron replies, \u201cI love how even the metaphors in this business are sexist.\u201d They find a possible ally in Diane (Annabeth Gish), a sympathetic but bluntly honest investor.Gordon has come along in tow, feeling at loose ends in a managerial role at Mutiny. The chameleonic Joe, meanwhile, has landed in California as the head of a software-security firm, sporting a Steve Jobsian beard and speaking in pretentious koans. (\u201cI\u2019ve been accused of selling fear,\u201d he tells a rapt audience. \u201cBut let me ask you: Is it fear or is it truth?\u201d)Joe\u2019s re-reinvention as a smug tech guru suits Mr. Pace, a striking but peculiar presence whom the show has struggled to use effectively. (He was well cast in the \u201cHobbit\u201d movies as the frosty, Eurotrash-y elven king Thranduil.) He seems fully at home now, strutting around his office listening to Gary Numan music, carrying himself like a human Patrick Nagel print.The new season takes time to reset, and the movement in the early episodes is slow. The character dynamics are solid, though, and the \u201980s details continue to be spot on. (At a fancy Valley restaurant, Donna stumbles over the pronunciation of a trendy new dish: risotto.)But any well-produced period piece can recreate bygone days. \u201cHalt\u201d lets you see them as the cusp of bracing change.

{"Headline": "In the Brazilian Rain Forest, \u2018a White Elephant, a Big One\u2019", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "Supported bySports of The TimesMANAUS, Brazil \u2014 Our tale takes metaphorical root in the early 1880s and the fevered imaginings of rubber barons. Sitting by the vast Amazon River, bewitched by pink river dolphins and torrential downpours, surrounded by rain forest, these men hungered for a legacy worthy of kings.So they imported an Italian architect, the mellifluously named Celestial Sacardim, to build an opera house. He conceived a heaven: columns of Carrara marble; chandeliers of Murano glass; 36,000 hand-painted roof tiles from Alsace; parquet floors of walnut, oak and Norwegian maple; tapestries from the looms of Flanders. Liverpool foundries provided the steel.The Teatro Amazonas was beautiful and insanely expensive and as ephemeral as everything else in this sweltering land. The rubber barons, legend has it, persuaded Enrico Caruso to journey here and sing Verdi. Then the rubber economy collapsed, and the opera house, which still stands in the colonial quarter, fell into decade upon decade of damp disuse.All of which brings us to a new hallucination: the Arena da Amaz\u00f4nia in Manaus, a city whose name comes from a local tribe and means Mother of the Gods. When Brazil embarked on an orgy of arena construction for the World Cup in 2014, Manaus city leaders decided to build the grandest arena of all. Years in the making, at a cost of $220 million, it was crafted to resemble a giant white basket of a type common in the region, atop a four-story concrete plaza. The arena seats 44,351 people.Save for the rarest of occasions, such as when Olympic women\u2019s soccer teams played here recently, this arena sits empty. Manaus is surrounded by a rain forest the size of France, Spain, Sweden, Greece and Italy combined, and it is reachable only by airplane or boat. Most in this hard-working city of two million have more on their mind than sports. The debt for this ziggurat has piled high and requires siphoning off of money intended for schools and hospitals. One-quarter of Manauarans are extremely poor; many lack running water.I wandered into the high-ceiling marble cafe of that opera house, which has been reincarnated as a tourist attraction and for music and dance events. Erica Damasceno, 20, sipped coffee as I asked about the stadium.She wagged her hand. \u201cI never go there,\u201d she said.Never? She shook her head. \u201cNever. So much money was put into it, and we have such great needs: schools, hospitals. Every big public project is an excuse to steal money.\u201dI stepped outside into an equatorial sun that felt like a fat hand pressed down on my skull. I found Maciel De Souza sitting in the shade of a tree with his co-worker Natalia Vilacio, tourist guides without tourists. Do you go to the stadium?\u201cYes,\u201d De Souza replied. How often? \u201cOnce.\u201dHe shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s a white elephant, a big one,\u201d he said in Portuguese through an interpreter. \u201cSometimes tourists like to see it. No one is ever inside.\u201dArena dreams tend toward the ridiculous, from Milwaukee to Minneapolis to Manaus. Promises of economic benefits are as illusory as lost civilizations. FIFA, the world soccer federation, required that World Cup host nations build at least eight stadiums. Brazil, in a fit of prideful excess, insisted on building 10, at a cost of nearly $2 billion.Those stadiums have become aspiring archaeological digs. Bras\u00edlia spent $550 million to build its stadium; it doubles as a municipal bus depot. The stadium in Cuiab\u00e1 cost $230 million, and homeless men sleep in the locker rooms. Managers at Recife\u2019s grand Arena Pernambuco are at such wits\u2019 end that they rented it out for a 15-year-old boy\u2019s birthday.The magazine Americas Quarterly found that Brazil\u2019s expenses for the World Cup greatly outran its revenue. Brazil repeated its wasteful act for the Olympics. There are corruption inquiries in a half-dozen states, with construction companies and hapless officials under the magnifying glass.That brings us back to Manaus and its Fitzcarraldo-esque excess. (Fitzcarraldo was the dreamer in a Werner Herzog movie who had the unhinged ambition to haul a steamship over a mountain in the Peruvian Amazon.)As was true for the opera house, no expense was spared in the construction of the Arena da Amaz\u00f4nia. Steel was poured in Europe and loaded at the port of Aveiro in Portugal. Workers filled three giant freighters to the gills with steel, and a fourth ferried the membrane that serves as the roof. It took this fleet 20 days to trundle across the Atlantic and many more to edge up the Amazon.Construction was a dank nightmare. Three workers died. Foundations were poured, and repoured. Steel joints buckled in the humidity. Project managers discovered that \u201can unwelcome tributary of the French River\u201d ran under the site. From December to March, Manaus receives about 45 inches of rain, so there was the Noah problem, too.No roads run to Manaus other than dangerous dirt tracks impassable in wet weather. As the project manager said at the time, \u201cThis was a huge, huge, huge challenge.\u201dThose challenges later turned to red ink. The local soccer teams here are the equivalent of the Rookie League Kingsport Mets and draw 1,000 fans on the best nights. They could not afford the rent. A few big league teams, those from S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, sometimes played here, but only if the state containing Manaus provided a subsidy of one sort or another. It is a four-hour flight from Rio to this capital of the Amazon.I imagine that Bono and Beyonc\u00e9 and Kendrick Lamar might dream of singing beneath a canopy of giant kapok trees. So far, none have journeyed here to do so.Fabricio Lima, Manaus\u2019s secretary of state for youth, sports and leisure, sat for an interview last week with my colleague Tania Franco. He faces daunting numbers. From January to April, the Arena da Amaz\u00f4nia generated $180,000 in revenue. Its expenses in that period totaled $560,000.That was its least-terrible performance in a while. So far, Lima\u2019s best customers are the Amazon\u2019s many evangelical ministers.Each night he dreams grandly; each morning he acts modestly. What is his latest idea for the arena? He smiled and replied, \u201cWeddings and birthday parties.\u201dLater that day, I walked through the old wrought-iron market down by the banks of the Amazon. A hot wind eddied and swirled, and I listened as Marcio Morais, an herb merchant, explained how his grandfather, who was raised in the jungle, taught him to harvest herbs. Liver inflammation, kidney problems, asthma, erectile dysfunction: He has an herb for nearly every ailment. Our talk turned to the arena.He frowned. \u201cOlympic Games are nice, but why are we spending money on this?\u201d he said. \u201cIt could have been a university. It could have been a school. Do you know we have an opera house? Such big dreams.\u201dI allowed that I knew of those dreams. \u201cSometimes you have to wake up,\u201d he replied.With that, we shook hands, and I stepped out into the dream-inducing heat.Email: powellm@nytimes.comslide showAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Walmart Rewrites Its E-Commerce Strategy With $3.3 Billion Deal for Jet.com", "Date": "2016-08-08", "News": "Supported byTraditional retailers have spent more than a decade and billions of dollars trying to transform their brick-and-mortar businesses for the online shopper. Yet Amazon and other digital upstarts continue to lap them.The purchase, and a shuffling in the executive ranks that comes with it, are Walmart\u2019s clearest acknowledgments yet that its online strategy is not working. It also sends a strong message to the rest of the consumer and retail industry: When it comes to competing against Amazon, not even the mightiest brick-and-mortar stores can go at it alone.\u201cThe other retailers are going to be looking up to it and saying, \u2018You know, absolutely, we\u2019ve been failing at doing this,\u2019\u201d said Jharonne Martis, a retail analyst at Thomson Reuters. \u201cBringing in an expert might be the key to it.\u201dOver all, Walmart\u2019s e-commerce sales have stalled. The online business grew just 7 percent last quarter, a number that Doug McMillon, the company\u2019s president and chief executive, acknowledged at the time was \u201ctoo slow.\u201d Most recently, the company has focused much of its online strategy on expanding its curbside grocery pickup business.Jet is perhaps best known for an algorithm that encourages bulk buying, an area where Walmart.com has fallen short and could energize its sagging online growth.Walmart said Jet offered it access to \u201curban and millennial customers,\u201d two groups that the retailer\u2019s large rural footprint has been slow to attract. Walmart said on Monday that Jet had added more than 400,000 users monthly.Jet says it uses a complex formula to offer items 10 to 15 percent less than competitors by adjusting prices based on the quantity of products bought at once. The company relies heavily on suppliers, and Walmart offers more pricing power and potentially better distribution operations through its vast network of warehouses across the country.Still, the $3.3 billion figure is eye-popping, given that Jet.com started selling products barely a year ago.Walmart is not valuing Jet.com solely based on traditional metrics like profitability, which the start-up does not have. The retailer is spending billions in cash and stock in large part for something \u2014 or someone \u2014 else: Marc Lore. Mr. Lore, a serial e-commerce entrepreneur who started Jet.com, is seen as one of the few executives who can help put a dent in Amazon\u2019s edge.\u201cIf you looked at Jet from a fundamentals perspective, the company wouldn\u2019t be worth what they\u2019re paying for it,\u201d said Anand Sanwal, the chief executive of CB Insights, a research firm covering venture capital. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to inject Marc and probably some of the veterans on his team, and try and help Walmart figure this out.\u201dMr. Lore, 46, will take over responsibility for Walmart.com in the United States and will continue running Jet, which will operate separately, Mr. McMillon said in a call with reporters. Walmart will be \u201cthoughtful\u201d about how it merges the two companies, and will focus on expanding both brands in the short-term, he said.Mr. Lore will replace Walmart\u2019s current top e-commerce executive, Neil Ashe, who will leave the company. Mr. McMillon said that now was the \u201cnatural inflection point\u201d for a leadership change and praised Mr. Ashe for doing an \u201coutstanding\u201d job building the company\u2019s online business.Mr. Lore co-founded a company, Quidsi, that grew into a collection of e-commerce websites, including Diapers.com and Soap.com. The company was sold to Amazon in 2010 for more than $500 million. He stayed at Amazon for two years, then left to figure out a new project.Investors lined up to back Mr. Lore on his next venture, Jet.com. He raised more than $200 million before the company sold a single product, and more than $500 million over all. In the latest funding in November, the company was valued at $1.5 billion, according to data compiled by CB Insights.He is seen as someone who can bring a unique approach when it comes to e-commerce, according to Adam Silverman, an analyst at Forrester, a research firm.\u201cMarc has been a creative force within the industry, creating pretty innovative business models, including Jet.com,\u201d Mr. Silverman said in a phone interview. \u201cHe\u2019s proven that he can create businesses from scratch, and Walmart needs a bit of that entrepreneurship within their e-commerce business.\u201dConnecting with Walmart could help Jet.com amplify its business without the stress of private fund-raising in a market that has become more challenging for unprofitable companies.Walmart said that while it would incorporate some of Jet\u2019s ideas and talent into Walmart.com, Jet would remain a separate brand, too. Yet both sites will continue to face a daunting reality: Amazon.com continues to wallop the competition.Amazon does more business online than any other retailer, yet still reports double-digit growth. In 2015, Amazon reported that net product sales rose 13 percent to $79.3 billion, while Walmart reported that global annual e-commerce revenue had risen 12 percent, to $13.7 billion, in its latest fiscal year.For Walmart, buying Jet may not be about beating Amazon at its own game, according to Charlie O\u2019Shea, the lead retail analyst for Moody\u2019s.\u201cWe view this as a race for second,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Shea said. \u201cAmazon\u2019s lead is so great that it\u2019s going to be virtually impossible to catch them, but you can compete with them.\u201dWhile legacy retailers continue to struggle with how best to compete online, e-commerce represents only 8 percent of all sales, Mr. O\u2019Shea said.\u201cAll Walmart has to do is be better than the other brick-and-mortar guys,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

He has worked frequently in episodic television, most recently directing for \u201cHawaii Five-O,\u201d and he is raising money to make a feature film about Mr. Corman, \u201cThe Man With Kaleidoscope Eyes.\u201dBut Mr. Dante is trenchantly realistic: \u201cMovies are a 20th-century art form, and the 20th century is over,\u201d he said during an interview in which he discussed fighting to keep the grimmest of Christmas tales in \u201cGremlins,\u201d working with a young Ethan Hawke and River Phoenix on their first movie and creating a \u201cGremlins 2\u201d character, who resembles a certain Republican presidential nominee. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.It was not a popular feature of the movie with the studio, or almost anyone. The studio took umbrage at it, and after our successful preview the only note they had was to get rid of that scene. I suppose I could have taken it out. In Chris Columbus\u2019s original script, it had been a throwaway. Phoebe really liked it because up until she tells that story, her character had been a pretty generic girlfriend \u2014 this gave her a secret. Because Steven Spielberg was the executive producer, I was able to get him to back me on keeping it in.\u201cExplorers\u201d (1985) is a movie you feel didn\u2019t quite work out, but it did introduce some terrific then-child actors, including Ethan Hawke and River Phoenix. What were they and the others like to work with? They were wonderful, very giving and open. I do love working with kids. It was like being a dad for a summer. Ethan wasn\u2019t even officially auditioning, he was with another actor who was auditioning and we really liked him. When we had Ethan, River and Jason Presson trapped up in the blue-screen \u201cspaceship,\u201d they were miked up, so we overheard their conversations, and it was remarkably reassuring that they were saying the same things I\u2019d said with my friends when I was 13.The 1987 science-fiction comedy \u201cInnerspace\u201d has a miniaturized Dennis Quaid piloting through the body of Martin Short \u2014 two very different types. How did you get them to interact in the illusion of a shared space?That\u2019s not quite how it worked, the idea of shooting one half of their performance. Wherever we were, whenever we were shooting, Dennis would be on the set in a booth, so the interaction was really happening. Dennis would hew to the script a little more than Marty. After you got a scene in the can, he\u2019d beg for more takes, in the voice of Katharine Hepburn, which was hard to resist.Carrie Fisher is one of the funniest people in Hollywood, but her comedic talents are rarely used, which is why she\u2019s an outstanding feature of 1989\u2019s \u201cThe \u2019Burbs\u201d with Tom Hanks. I\u2019m also a fan of \u201cLooney Tunes: Back in Action\u201d (2003), but I hear you\u2019re not.I took that on because my friend Chuck Jones had recently passed away and I felt I owed it to him to present the characters as accurately as possible, which hadn\u2019t been the case with \u201cSpace Jam.\u201d It was very frustrating to make: We got so much input from people who were never going to see the movie. I learned here that it\u2019s not a good idea to go to work angry, although it might have helped with the Daffy Duck segments. When I saw its final cut, I thought it was a noisy, annoying movie of the sort that other people make. I do feel it does represent the characters accurately. I came out feeling exhausted. But that\u2019s the norm these days.Among other outrageous characters, \u201cGremlins 2: The New Batch\u201d features a media mogul-real estate tycoon named Daniel Clamp, author of \u201cI Took Manhattan,\u201d played by John Glover. Do you find his real-life model as funny as he was back in 1990?Had I but known! He\u2019s definitely not as funny as he used to be. Because the movie treats the character with some skewed affection, I now like to think Clamp is more Ted Turner than Donald Trump.An article on Thursday about the director Joe Dante quoted incorrectly from his comments about the actors in a scene in his film \u201cExplorers.\u201d One of them is Jason Presson, not Bobby Fite.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How a Bird Feeder Revived My Marriage", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "Supported byModern LoveMy husband was no longer the man I had married. He had become grumpy and short-tempered, acting as if life had dealt him a bad hand.He works in publishing, an industry that has its own share of problems. A self-made man, he worries that our sons have been handed too much. Our marriage was facing the familiar strains of midlife. All of this was getting him down.Until he installed the bird feeder.\u201cBut that\u2019s so messy,\u201d I said. In Mumbai, India, where we live, apartments are tiny. And while we have a little veranda with a few green plants, we do not have birds, and I did not see the point of putting up a bird feeder on our small open space to feed nonexistent creatures.To try to feed birds in a city that\u2019s rife with starvation and poverty also seemed too privileged and romantic a notion, something only rich people did in the Western world. Not here. Not in Mumbai.\u201cWe live in India,\u201d I reminded him.\u201cBirds belong to the world,\u201d he replied. And that was that.So up it went, an ugly contraption he bought on Amazon and had shipped to us. It was transparent, cylindrical and odd-looking. Grain was dutifully filled, and I watched skeptically as it stood solitary and defiant on our veranda in the muggy monsoon weather in a city where I neither saw birds fly nor come to roost.Our lives were busy with the inevitable commotion that forms the basis of any marriage today. We worked hard. We spoke less. We watched too much television. We spent many evenings answering emails and responding to texts. Our sons were grown-up and had their own lives. We had ours.One lonely morning in a long succession of lonely mornings, I caught my husband\u2019s eye over the newspaper. He was signaling to me in that grotesque, animated fashion adults use to convey something unspoken through improvised sign language, pointing to our little veranda.I turned. And there it was: a bright green parrot with a red beak perched on the ledge of the bird feeder. The parrot cocked his head. We cocked ours. The parrot studied us. We studied him. And then he settled down and dug right in.I glanced at my husband. He beamed in response. He looked as if he had just given birth.And soon our mornings became a bit more than the rush to catch the bus. There was anticipation to our workday until our winged visitors would arrive. One morning, a cocky sparrow came to us.\u201cDid you know they are almost extinct in this city?\u201d my husband whispered.We waited to see which feathered friend would drop in next. Who would be vying for top spot? Who would win the day?\u201cSo you think it\u2019s too tiny, the entrance?\u201d my husband asked me one evening.I looked at the doorway to our apartment, puzzled, only to realize that he meant the entrance to the bird feeder. \u201cWell, they have tiny beaks,\u201d I muttered. \u201cThey don\u2019t need a granary.\u201dHe looked contemplative, as if he were seriously considering my response. \u201cBut it helps when you have a wider plate on the dining table, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d he said.\u201cThat\u2019s a little sunbird!\u201d I exclaimed with disbelief. \u201cIn Mumbai!\u201dAnd suddenly the grumpy man\u2019s face lit up, his stress lines disappearing. Could this be a new him?He would measure the level of the grain with great care and fill the feeder.\u201cOh, no,\u201d he would exclaim with dismay. \u201cThey did not eat today.\u201d But he was not referring to our sons, whom we seldom saw, or to any human beings. He meant the birds. Everything was about his feathered friends.Our mornings became the hours I most looked forward to. We exchanged far more than a glance. It was like the intrepid excitement of opening our doors to strangers or new friends and having a meal ready. Will they come? Will the food be enough? Will they enjoy their dinner and come back for more?One evening, I came home to find my husband sitting with little bowls of different grains of different textures. \u201cThis food is very good for the birds,\u201d he said as the grains slipped though his fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s good for their digestion.\u201dI watched the sifting grains, thinking: What\u2019s next?He spent many a Sunday on the internet researching birds, bird food and eating patterns. When do they feed? How much? Why so little?Our conversations often began with a bird fact. A male songbird sings 2,000 times a day, for example. A pigeon\u2019s feathers outweigh its bones.At night, my husband took stock of his day by keeping track of how many birds had visited and for how long.One very windy Sunday, as we both gazed out from our little veranda, he seemed pensive. \u201cIs it your job?\u201d I asked anxiously, eager to help.\u201cNo,\u201d he said, glaring at me for being so hopelessly insensitive. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a bird visit in the last 24 hours. I\u2019ve been watching.\u201d\u201cPerhaps it needs a GPS tracker,\u201d I said jokingly. I mean, they were just birds. I was the wife.That evening, I found that he had moved the bird feeder to another location.\u201cIt\u2019s easier for them to find it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to be comfortable. After all, they come to eat.\u201dCan you be jealous of birds? They commanded his attention more than I did. I began glaring at the pigeons and muttering cuss words at the noisy crow. \u201cYou are upstaging me,\u201d I muttered to the cooing dove.Sea gulls gave me the eye, and I was suspicious of the eagle that swooped too low. I felt like Cruella de Vil from Disney\u2019s \u201c101 Dalmatians,\u201d devious plotter and coldhearted criminal. I was coming in the way of their happiness. And his.As I cleaned up after dinner one evening, I thought of the food on our table, feeling grateful for all we have in a country where malnourishment is rampant. \u201cFinish what\u2019s in front of you,\u201d I used to snap at my sons. \u201cAnd no, you have to eat what\u2019s at home, not order a pizza again.\u201dOne morning while my husband was away, I sat in my little nook nursing a coffee. My father had been hospitalized, and I was inundated with work and a pressing deadline. The hopelessness of life kept creeping up on me. I wiped my tears in anger and gazed at the bird feeder, which was now an out-of-focus blur.Someone cocked his head around the feeder. It was my friend the parrot. Or rather, my husband\u2019s friend.Well, tough luck, pal, I thought. There\u2019s just me to contend with today.He stared at me. I stared back. We seemed to be playing a silly game of who blinks first. I moved closer, but he didn\u2019t budge.He continued eating in little bites from the bird feeder as I inched closer. And just when I could see him up close in his magnificent finery, he looked at me sideways and a little crossly. Keep your distance, he threatened.And for once I listened. I watched the bird eat and fill his tummy. I imagined his pleasure. I shared in his contentment. If he were able to roll onto his back and rub his belly, he would have.It was such a simple joy. Such a simple kindness. I smiled as fresh tears threatened to spill again.That night, I snuggled close to my once-grumpy man and held his hand tight.\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d he asked.\u201cYes,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI shared a meal with your friend today.\u201dThese days, my husband smiles more and grumbles less. He now looks at the trees in the neighborhood and talks about how important they are.\u201cFor the birds, you mean?\u201d\u201cFor us,\u201d he says quietly.And perhaps that\u2019s it. You reach a stage in life when you yearn to do something new. You yearn to do something good. To give back. To find yourself. To rediscover love. In order to live better.Some nurture a hobby. Others donate to charity. A few travel the world or volunteer to teach. The wealthy may take themselves out for elaborate meals or on a trip to an exotic city, where they can dance in the rain or go bungee-jumping or learn to speak Mandarin.My husband did none of those things. He visited none of those places. Didn\u2019t tick off items on his bucket list.But he found himself anyway. And in doing so, he found us. All he did was go online and order an ugly bird feeder. And it has made all the difference.Tista Sen lives in Mumbai, India, where she works as national creative director at the J.

{"Headline": "When Every Company Is a Tech Company, Does the Label Matter?", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "Supported byStrategiesApple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon have created something of a watershed moment in the stock market.They became the four most valuable companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index at the close of trading on Aug. 1, according to S.&P.\u2019s official tally. That meant that tech companies, by one common definition, occupied the four top spots in the market capitalization rankings, a rare and brief occurrence.\u201cIt may never have happened before at the close of trading,\u201d said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. The full history of daily rankings isn\u2019t readily available, however, so we can\u2019t be certain, and such rankings are evanescent, shifting with every tick of the stock market. In fact, on Friday, Amazon dropped back into sixth place.But no matter: The early August rankings were a reminder of how far tech has come. It is a dominant force in the stock market and the economy, one so all-encompassing that tech may no longer even be a useful concept for understanding today\u2019s stock market.One of them is Exxon Mobil, the energy giant and the most valuable company in the S.&P. as recently as 2012. But Exxon Mobil has been cut down in size by the oil price debacle. The other is Berkshire Hathaway, Warren E. Buffett\u2019s conglomerate, which the S.&P. categorizes as a financial services company \u2014 the only such company left in the Top 10 market cap list. Berkshire announced its own earnings after trading closed on Friday. We\u2019ll soon learn whether the market is pleased enough to vault Berkshire further ahead of Amazon.The three tech companies at the very top in market cap \u2014 Apple, Google and Microsoft \u2014 have held high positions for a long while. (Google, ranked second, trades as Alphabet, the name of its parent company.) Google passed Apple in value briefly this year, but Apple regained the top perch, which it has held since 2012. Microsoft, now No. 3, was the most valuable company during the last tech boom, in the early 2000s.Virtually no one disputes S.&P.\u2019s formal classification of Apple, Google and Microsoft as \u201cinformation technology\u201d companies. The same is true of Facebook, which held seventh place in the latest list of most valuable companies. But while Amazon is often described as a tech company \u2014 and undoubtedly uses and creates innovative technology \u2014 S.&P. has never classified it as one.In fact, Amazon is formally known as a \u201cconsumer discretionary company,\u201d like Walmart, which it has displaced as a member of the Top 10 most valuable companies. Amazon is the only consumer discretionary company left in the Top 10. Is it in some sense a tech company? Certainly, and we\u2019ll get back to that.But the same can be said, to one degree or another, about the three other members of the Top 10 \u2014 old companies that are still prospering in large part because of their mastery of advanced technologies. Johnson & Johnson, for example, which is ranked eighth, is a health care company, yet it is heavily involved in technology of a biological kind. Then there is General Electric, the diversified industrial company (and, until recently, also a financial services company), once described as a bellwether for the entire market. It conducts advanced research and sells tech products.Last on the list is AT&T, a telecommunications company, which, in an early form, helped create computer languages and operating systems on which modern tech companies are built. In 1957, when the S.&P. 500 was born, an ancestral version of AT&T was the most valuable company in the United States by a very wide margin, said Jeremy J. Siegel, a Wharton business school professor, the author of \u201cStocks for the Long Run\u201d and a market historian.\u201cAT&T back then was a highly regulated old phone company,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a giant, later broken up into smaller companies. And it was an outlier, because the other big companies in the S.&P. 500 in that era were mainly materials companies \u2014 like United States Steel, DuPont and Union Carbide \u2014 and an awful lot of oil companies.\u201dIn 1957, the economy ran on oil, and the biggest energy company was Standard Oil of New Jersey \u2014 an ancestor of Exxon Mobil. No pure tech company ranked in the Top 10 back then, not even IBM, which soon became the dominant tech company, a position it held until Microsoft surpassed it in the mid-1990s. That was the decade of the great tech boom, culminating in the bubble that burst in March 2000. Microsoft was No. 1 in market cap at the end of 1999, and four other tech companies \u2014 Cisco Systems, Intel, IBM and America Online \u2014 were also among the Top 10 most valuable companies. The stock market celebrated tech\u2019s ascendance then, as it does now.But this is a different era. When you dig deeper into the S.&P. 500, it\u2019s clear that while the valuations of tech companies swelled to unrealistically high proportions in those bubble years, the valuations of most companies are far more modest now. In March 2000, the height of the bubble, the value of information technology companies swelled to 34.5 percent of the total market cap of the S.&P. 500. At the moment, the comparable figure is only 20.7 percent, data from the Bespoke Investment Group shows. That\u2019s not much more than the 15.7 percent share of financial companies or the 15.2 percent share of the health care sector. By contrast, finance ballooned as high as 22.3 percent at the end of 2006, in what can be seen in hindsight as a financial bubble.On the other hand, materials and energy companies, which together constituted almost half of the total value of the S.&P. 500 in 1957, now account for less than 10 percent of it. That reflects the collapse of energy and commodity prices over the last few years, and it may well be a temporary phenomenon. In the meantime, diversified energy companies like Exxon Mobil are investing heavily in technology, a necessity if they are to flourish.It\u2019s clear even to energy companies, in other words, that tech\u2019s abiding power in the marketplace is not temporary. Technology permeates every sector of the economy, even those not formally classified as high-tech. Whether companies like Amazon and Johnson & Johnson should carry tech labels is beside the point. Tech has already taken over.These days every company is a tech company, but some have better niches, faster growth, more attractive offerings or more favorable share prices than others. These kinds of fundamental distinctions will influence the Top 10 rankings of the future.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

When Mossberg pressed him, Spiegel still seemed hesitant. \u201cThere are so many things that feed into diversity and inequality that unpacking them on the stage is probably not the best use of time,\u201d he said.To me, these two incidents do underscore the importance of a diverse work force: Tech companies are usually small groups of homogeneous people who are trying to make products that satisfy the entire planet. At the very least, a diverse work force can help guard against them making choices that offend large swaths of their potential userbase. Even more than that, a diverse work force can help them come up with new ideas that may not have occurred to 20-something Stanford bros.One would hope this doesn\u2019t happen again, but this is tech: anything goes, however terrible.On that note, have a good weekend, friend!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In the Brazilian Rain Forest, \u2018a White Elephant, a Big One\u2019", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySports of The TimesMANAUS, Brazil \u2014 Our tale takes metaphorical root in the early 1880s and the fevered imaginings of rubber barons. Sitting by the vast Amazon River, bewitched by pink river dolphins and torrential downpours, surrounded by rain forest, these men hungered for a legacy worthy of kings.So they imported an Italian architect, the mellifluously named Celestial Sacardim, to build an opera house. He conceived a heaven: columns of Carrara marble; chandeliers of Murano glass; 36,000 hand-painted roof tiles from Alsace; parquet floors of walnut, oak and Norwegian maple; tapestries from the looms of Flanders. Liverpool foundries provided the steel.The Teatro Amazonas was beautiful and insanely expensive and as ephemeral as everything else in this sweltering land. The rubber barons, legend has it, persuaded Enrico Caruso to journey here and sing Verdi. Then the rubber economy collapsed, and the opera house, which still stands in the colonial quarter, fell into decade upon decade of damp disuse.All of which brings us to a new hallucination: the Arena da Amaz\u00f4nia in Manaus, a city whose name comes from a local tribe and means Mother of the Gods. When Brazil embarked on an orgy of arena construction for the World Cup in 2014, Manaus city leaders decided to build the grandest arena of all. Years in the making, at a cost of $220 million, it was crafted to resemble a giant white basket of a type common in the region, atop a four-story concrete plaza. The arena seats 44,351 people.Save for the rarest of occasions, such as when Olympic women\u2019s soccer teams played here recently, this arena sits empty. Manaus is surrounded by a rain forest the size of France, Spain, Sweden, Greece and Italy combined, and it is reachable only by airplane or boat. Most in this hard-working city of two million have more on their mind than sports. The debt for this ziggurat has piled high and requires siphoning off of money intended for schools and hospitals. One-quarter of Manauarans are extremely poor; many lack running water.I wandered into the high-ceiling marble cafe of that opera house, which has been reincarnated as a tourist attraction and for music and dance events. Erica Damasceno, 20, sipped coffee as I asked about the stadium.She wagged her hand. \u201cI never go there,\u201d she said.Never? She shook her head. \u201cNever. So much money was put into it, and we have such great needs: schools, hospitals. Every big public project is an excuse to steal money.\u201dI stepped outside into an equatorial sun that felt like a fat hand pressed down on my skull. I found Maciel De Souza sitting in the shade of a tree with his co-worker Natalia Vilacio, tourist guides without tourists. Do you go to the stadium?\u201cYes,\u201d De Souza replied. How often? \u201cOnce.\u201dHe shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s a white elephant, a big one,\u201d he said in Portuguese through an interpreter. \u201cSometimes tourists like to see it. No one is ever inside.\u201dArena dreams tend toward the ridiculous, from Milwaukee to Minneapolis to Manaus. Promises of economic benefits are as illusory as lost civilizations. FIFA, the world soccer federation, required that World Cup host nations build at least eight stadiums. Brazil, in a fit of prideful excess, insisted on building 10, at a cost of nearly $2 billion.Those stadiums have become aspiring archaeological digs. Bras\u00edlia spent $550 million to build its stadium; it doubles as a municipal bus depot. The stadium in Cuiab\u00e1 cost $230 million, and homeless men sleep in the locker rooms. Managers at Recife\u2019s grand Arena Pernambuco are at such wits\u2019 end that they rented it out for a 15-year-old boy\u2019s birthday.The magazine Americas Quarterly found that Brazil\u2019s expenses for the World Cup greatly outran its revenue. Brazil repeated its wasteful act for the Olympics. There are corruption inquiries in a half-dozen states, with construction companies and hapless officials under the magnifying glass.That brings us back to Manaus and its Fitzcarraldo-esque excess. (Fitzcarraldo was the dreamer in a Werner Herzog movie who had the unhinged ambition to haul a steamship over a mountain in the Peruvian Amazon.)As was true for the opera house, no expense was spared in the construction of the Arena da Amaz\u00f4nia. Steel was poured in Europe and loaded at the port of Aveiro in Portugal. Workers filled three giant freighters to the gills with steel, and a fourth ferried the membrane that serves as the roof. It took this fleet 20 days to trundle across the Atlantic and many more to edge up the Amazon.Construction was a dank nightmare. Three workers died. Foundations were poured, and repoured. Steel joints buckled in the humidity. Project managers discovered that \u201can unwelcome tributary of the French River\u201d ran under the site. From December to March, Manaus receives about 45 inches of rain, so there was the Noah problem, too.No roads run to Manaus other than dangerous dirt tracks impassable in wet weather. As the project manager said at the time, \u201cThis was a huge, huge, huge challenge.\u201dThose challenges later turned to red ink. The local soccer teams here are the equivalent of the Rookie League Kingsport Mets and draw 1,000 fans on the best nights. They could not afford the rent. A few big league teams, those from S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, sometimes played here, but only if the state containing Manaus provided a subsidy of one sort or another. It is a four-hour flight from Rio to this capital of the Amazon.I imagine that Bono and Beyonc\u00e9 and Kendrick Lamar might dream of singing beneath a canopy of giant kapok trees. So far, none have journeyed here to do so.Fabricio Lima, Manaus\u2019s secretary of state for youth, sports and leisure, sat for an interview last week with my colleague Tania Franco. He faces daunting numbers. From January to April, the Arena da Amaz\u00f4nia generated $180,000 in revenue. Its expenses in that period totaled $560,000.That was its least-terrible performance in a while. So far, Lima\u2019s best customers are the Amazon\u2019s many evangelical ministers.Each night he dreams grandly; each morning he acts modestly. What is his latest idea for the arena? He smiled and replied, \u201cWeddings and birthday parties.\u201dLater that day, I walked through the old wrought-iron market down by the banks of the Amazon. A hot wind eddied and swirled, and I listened as Marcio Morais, an herb merchant, explained how his grandfather, who was raised in the jungle, taught him to harvest herbs. Liver inflammation, kidney problems, asthma, erectile dysfunction: He has an herb for nearly every ailment. Our talk turned to the arena.He frowned. \u201cOlympic Games are nice, but why are we spending money on this?\u201d he said. \u201cIt could have been a university. It could have been a school. Do you know we have an opera house? Such big dreams.\u201dI allowed that I knew of those dreams. \u201cSometimes you have to wake up,\u201d he replied.With that, we shook hands, and I stepped out into the dream-inducing heat.Email: powellm@nytimes.comslide showAdvertisement"}

Like an imperial armada rolling out from North America\u2019s West Coast, these companies would try to establish beachheads on every other continent.But when American giants tried to enter the waters of China, the world\u2019s largest internet market, the armada invariably ran aground.Plagued by opaque and ever-shifting regulations and a culturally abstruse way of doing business, American companies fell to a series of local giants. Instead of Google, Baidu. Instead of Facebook, WeChat, owned by the giant Tencent. And instead of Amazon, Alibaba.That has left us with a divide: Today, there is the Chinese internet, and there is the internet of the rest of the world. A network seen in its early days as a tool to foster financial and political unity across a fragmented planet has irrevocably cleaved into two completely separate spheres.Entrepreneurs across the globe can choose to win in China or the rest of the world. You can be Alibaba or you can be Amazon. You can be Uber or you can be Didi. But you can\u2019t be both. Given the rising Chinese market and increasing tension over the role of American tech firms in the rest of the globe, the gulf between the two sides promises to become one of the most important factors in determining the shape of global tech innovation.How exactly might the war play out? In some ways, being at the mercy of two poles of internet leadership could be good for citizens of planet Earth. In emerging markets like India, the Middle East and parts of Africa and South America, the giants of China and the United States are increasingly investing billions to compete for local customers in e-commerce, social networking, ride sharing and other markets.\u201cAmazon is increasingly making its own branded products, taking on Procter & Gamble and others, and also getting into the logistics business, and shipping, and everything else,\u201d Mr. Clark said. \u201cBut Alibaba is a marketplace that doesn\u2019t hold inventory and describes themselves as helping local merchants \u2014 so maybe there\u2019s some argument that Alibaba could serve as a counter globally to Amazon.\u201d\u201cIn that way it could be like the Yalta Conference,\u201d said Mr. Clark, referring to the 1945 meeting in which the victors of World War II determined the postwar geopolitical order.\u201cThe barrels that will be thrown at you when you\u2019re trying to do business in China will just never stop,\u201d said Mark Natkin, the managing director of Marbridge Consulting, an advisory firm based in Beijing. \u201cYou\u2019ll constantly be above one barrel or recovering from jumping one, and as you\u2019re dusting yourself off you look down the road and here comes the next one.\u201dCompared with previous failures, Uber seemed to do everything right in China. It set up a separate company, Uber China, which had a buy-in from local investors, including from a local giant, Baidu. It hired many local experts, and worked closely with the national government to foster friendly relations.Insiders say Mr. Kalanick was also personally invested in the deal. He visited China eight times in the last year and a half, and became something of a tech star in the Chinese media.Publicly Mr. Kalanick had insisted he was fighting for total victory in China. But he must have known that Uber would always struggle to achieve dominance, given the emerging centrality of ride-sharing to the future of infrastructure in China. Still, even if he failed to win everything in China, investing early in the country seemed too big to skip.For now, it\u2019s especially delicious frosting. The $2 billion Uber spent tackling China is now worth about $7 billion in the new merged entity; if Didi does become one of China\u2019s largest tech companies, the value of Uber\u2019s stake in China could rise geometrically, making the firm much more attractive in a potential initial public offering. Pulling out of China also frees up Uber to invest more in other markets \u2014 India and Indonesia are big targets \u2014 as well as expand its expertise in core technological initiatives like mapping data and self-driving cars.But if spending big to tackle China ultimately works out for Uber, it will be an anomaly, and certainly not a model for other American tech giants.\u201cThe ride-sharing market is one the few markets where the upside is big enough to justify going in,\u201d Mr. Thompson said. \u201cFor most other companies, going into China is still going to be nothing but pain.\u201dEmail: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Off to College? Maybe These Devices Should Go Along", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixWHEN Vanessa Arreola, 18, starts her freshman year at Stanford University this fall, the top item on her back-to-school wish list is a MacBook Pro.She said she wouldn\u2019t consider a tablet because she prefers a traditional keyboard. She relies on apps like Google Docs for documents and Google Slides for presentations, which are available through a web browser.\u201cA tablet is just like your cellphone, but bigger,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see a point of getting a tablet.\u201dBut Claire Ashcroft, 19, who studies public health at Brigham Young University in Idaho, said the opposite. Half of her textbooks are digitized, and she uses apps like Microsoft Excel and Word \u2014 so her ideal school device would be a Windows machine with a touch screen, like a Microsoft Surface tablet.The polarizing responses illustrate how back-to-school shopping for technology gadgets has become increasingly complex for parents. In the past, the dilemma for most students was whether to get a Windows PC or a Mac. Now, because of a proliferation of different computing forms with the rise of mobile devices, the debate has shifted toward whether to buy a computer or a tablet \u2014 and which operating system on top of that.Then there are the different types of software and tools that students use, like flashcard apps or readers for digital textbooks, some of which are for mobile devices and others for computers.To make back-to-school season easier, parents should have a conversation with their children about what devices and which operating system to buy based on their student\u2019s area of studies and the apps they use.I also compiled a guide to some of the best back-to-school products, including computers, mobile devices, audio accessories and food gadgets. The list was curated after testing dozens of products and interviewing five college students about the tools that help them do homework and get through cramming sessions. (While this list focuses on college students, many of whom will be getting their own computers for the first time, some items would also be a good fit for high schoolers.)The students I polled were split on whether a laptop or tablet would be the best study tool. In general, students in science-oriented fields would probably benefit from a laptop, which can handle multitasking more easily and run more powerful apps than tablets. For designers and liberal arts majors who are using more lightweight apps for writing essays or drawing sketches, a tablet may be a better fit.There are two caveats. First, Apple is expected to release a brand-new iPhone this fall; so if you go the Apple route, it would be wise to wait a few months. Second, these are high-end phones that cost roughly $700, which could easily blow your budget.High-quality audio gear is a sound investment for students. Roommates can be loud distractions from schoolwork and sleep, plus a bit of music can ease the pain of typing out a tedious essay.Speaking of water kettles, a food gadget or two will not go amiss in students\u2019 lives, especially if the devices offer a shortcut to downing some caffeine or gobbling up ramen.But she would like a Microsoft Surface tablet.\u201cIf we\u2019re talking wishful here, I would choose that,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a couple of friends with those, and I think they\u2019re pretty nice.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the maker of the Nexus 6P.

{"Headline": "Time Warner Acquires 10% Stake in Hulu", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "Supported byTime Warner announced on Wednesday that it had joined forces with several rival media companies to chart a new future for the streaming television service Hulu, acquiring a 10 percent stake in it and committing programming for its new live TV offering.Time Warner paid $583 million in cash for the stake, valuing Hulu at $5.8 billion, an executive said during a conference call on Wednesday. Hulu\u2019s other corporate owners are 21st Century Fox, Comcast and the Walt Disney Company.The development makes Time Warner \u201can official member of the \u2018cool kids\u2019 club,\u2019\u201d Todd Juenger, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, said in a research note.The new Hulu service is an attempt by its traditional entertainment company owners to secure their footing in television\u2019s digital future, where streaming has become the norm and competition from deep-pocketed rivals like Netflix and Amazon has intensified. Hulu has more than 10 million subscribers, compared with Netflix\u2019s 46 million paid subscribers in the United States.\u201cThis investment from Time Warner marks a major step for Hulu as we continue to redefine television for both consumers and advertisers,\u201d Mike Hopkins, Hulu\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement.The transaction came at a crucial time for Hulu. The service was \u201cfacing rapidly mounting losses approaching $500 million\u201d a year, according to Richard Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG Research. The investment from Time Warner reduces the amount of funding needed from its existing owners, he added.\u201cHulu is locked in a fierce battle for content with far larger Netflix and a far better funded Amazon, with Hulu\u2019s subbase not scaling as rapidly as we would expect based on its content investments,\u201d Mr. Greenfield said in a research note. \u201cIn turn, the Hulu partnership is eager to find additional partner(s) to enter the joint venture to help fund the losses, which are likely to increase meaningfully\u201d with the start of the new live service.Time Warner said that its TNT, TBS, CNN and other Turner cable networks would be available live and on demand on Hulu\u2019s new live-streaming service.\u201cOur investment in Hulu underscores Time Warner\u2019s commitment to supporting and developing new platforms for the delivery of high-quality content and great consumer experiences to audiences around the globe,\u201d Mr. Bewkes said.The transaction includes no representation on the board of Hulu, which gives Time Warner less say in dictating Hulu\u2019s destiny but also reduces the complicated ownership structure of the venture. Time Warner previously was in discussions about coming in as an equal partner in the venture, according to a person briefed on the discussions.\u201cWe don\u2019t have an active role, and coming in as the 10 percent investor without a board seat, we think it reduces complications around governance,\u201d Mr. Bewkes said during a conference call.He added that the transaction would infuse Hulu with more resources to \u201cfostering competition and innovation\u201d among streaming services as well as traditional cable and satellite distributors.One big concern about the new streamlined bundle from Hulu is that traditional cable and satellite distributors view it as a threat. That could put at risk the billions of dollars that the TV networks receive each year from those traditional distributors.Both Hulu and its corporate owners have downplayed those concerns, stating that it is designed for people who don\u2019t subscribe to a traditional pay television service.Total revenue was down 5 percent in the quarter to $7 billion, with a decline at the company\u2019s Warner Brothers film and television studios offset by growth at its Turner and HBO units.Advertisement"}

We really want to invest a lot in that nexus, and having someone like him bridge that and speak on our behalf is really powerful.\u201dPandora, which began in 2005 and went public in 2011, has long been the most popular internet radio service, and it is one of a handful of digital music brands that have become household names. But its growth has slowed as it has faced more pressure from streaming competitors. Pandora\u2019s number of average monthly listeners reached its peak at the end of 2014, at 81.5 million.\u201cPandora is in a difficult chapter,\u201d said Mark Mulligan, a digital media analyst with Midia Research. \u201cWall Street doesn\u2019t like mature growth stories in young tech companies.

In its earlier days, Pandora stayed largely independent of the music industry, relying on statutory licensing processes rather than dealing with record labels, which has sometimes resulted in ill will over royalties. Last year, Pandora reported that it paid $610 million, or about 52 percent of its revenue, in royalties and related costs.These days, Pandora is eager to promote the marketing platforms it makes available to artists, such as audio messages that can be delivered to fans and detailed data about the popularity of particular songs. When asked, Questlove said he initially had some hesitation about working with Pandora given its past conflicts with music world, but said he was confident that the company paid its royalty obligations properly and that part of his job would be to speak up for musicians in the company.Mr. Westergren said he was \u201cvery open to a candid assessment of how artists think about it.\u201dQuestlove said he was most excited about the possibilities of producing a radio show that would open listeners\u2019 eyes to more than just the biggest and most heavily promoted pop.

You know what they say in baseball \u2014 if you get a hit one out of every three at-bats, you\u2019re in the Hall of Fame.The TV series, which at least at the start is set in Marfa, the arts-and-academic community in Texas, certainly has casting going for it. Kevin Bacon is Dick, and Griffin Dunne is Chris\u2019s husband, Sylv\u00e8re. The series, though, rises or falls on the shoulders of the Chris character, and Kathryn Hahn, one of the most reliable actresses around, looks in the pilot as if she could end up with some statuettes for her portrayal.The pilot doesn\u2019t progress far into the story \u2014 Chris has barely had time to meet Dick and share one dismissive dinner with him and her husband \u2014 but it\u2019s clear that Ms. Hahn\u2019s character is eager to go exploring and that Ms. Soloway intends to make a challenging, simmering, provocative sort of comedy.Another cult following also gets a pilot to chew on: \u201cThe Tick,\u201d the latest try at making a TV series out of the comic book character that Ben Edlund created in the 1980s. The title character (played here by Peter Serafinowicz) is a parody of a superhero, wearing a blue tick costume and speaking in overblown phrases that sometimes sort of make sense.And then there\u2019s \u201cJean-Claude Van Johnson,\u201d in which Jean-Claude Van Damme tries to parody his own action-movie persona. He plays himself, but it turns out he has an undercover identity as Jean-Claude Van Johnson, a vaguely defined contractor who does black-ops work.But \u2014 pay attention because this gets confusing \u2014 to go undercover as Van Johnson, Van Johnson has to assume the identity of Jean-Claude Van Damme, because a movie shoot is what gets him into Bulgaria, where Van Johnson needs to be. If that seems like a convoluted way to get to a simple gag, it is, and though the pilot does pay off in a pretty funny fight sequence, it\u2019s not at all clear by its end where this series intends to go with what seems like a one-joke premise.Advertisement"}

Consequently, Soviet authorities assign three commissars to repatriate the composer; when they succumb to the pleasures of Paris and delay their mission, the stern and beautiful Ninotchka (Cyd Charisse) is dispatched to bring them all back \u2014 unless, of course, Paris works its magic on her.Structurally, \u201cSilk Stockings\u201d is similar to \u201cFunny Face,\u201d another musical ode to Paris released earlier in 1957, wherein Mr. Astaire\u2019s glib fashion photographer successfully wooed Audrey Hepburn\u2019s diffident beatnik. But \u201cSilk Stockings\u201d is less seamless entertainment, in part because of its ambivalence regarding American show business.The movie starts with the rousing \u201cToo Bad We Can\u2019t Go Back to Moscow,\u201d an implicit paean to the melting pot by the three commissars \u2014 Joseph Buloff, Jules Munshin and Peter Lorre, each actor channeling a distinct theatrical tradition. (Mr. Buloff came out of Yiddish \u201cart\u201d theater; Mr. Munshin was schooled in the Catskills; and Mr. Lorre, advertised as making his \u201cfirst big comedy role,\u201d had achieved some fame acting with Bertolt Brecht in Berlin.) The number turns ecstatic when Mr. Astaire, then in his late 50s, joins with his own version of a cha-cha.Best remembered for his early sound films, including the musicals \u201cApplause\u201d and \u201cLove Me Tonight,\u201d the director Rouben Mamoulian (1898-1987) had a notable theatrical career, staging the original Broadway productions of \u201cPorgy and Bess,\u201d \u201cOklahoma!\u201d and \u201cCarousel,\u201d among others. His most canny strategy in directing the movie, which would be his swan song, was to treat \u201cSilk Stockings\u201d as a dance musical \u2014 and dance itself as a form of liberation.\u201cSilk Stockings\u201d has been criticized for its reactionary politics, sexual and otherwise. But if Western consumption triumphs over Soviet ideals, and Ninotchka becomes \u201ca real woman,\u201d capitalist victory is not cost-free. Ninotchka\u2019s personhood is diminished, even as the composer\u2019s work is vulgarized. (Perhaps Mr. Astaire\u2019s is as well: His final number, \u201cThe Ritz Roll and Rock,\u201d is a misguided attempt to be \u201cwith it.\u201d)Upbeat as it is, \u201cSilk Stockings\u201d has an underlying melancholy. The fondness with which it sends up Russian culture is striking, perhaps more today than in 1957.Thirteen years before \u201cSilk Stockings,\u201d MGM envisioned another romantic alliance between a debonair American musical artist and a sober, if winsome, Soviet lass: \u201cSong of Russia\u201d (available on DVD from Warner Archive).Its star Robert Taylor, who told the House Un-American Activities Committee he\u2019d been coerced by the Office of War Information into making the movie, plays an American conductor.

{"Headline": "When the Shop Looks a Lot Like Home", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySign of the TimesAs shopping online from the comfort of your home continues its unchecked expansion \u2014 almost $100 billion in online sales in the first quarter of 2016 \u2014 in-store shopping is turning increasingly homey. Beyond the physical space, note the proliferation of amenities that soften the pecuniary nature of the retail experience: At one end of the spectrum, a cup holder on the handlebar of your grocery-store cart; at the other end, silver platters of chilled San Pellegrino at the ready. And since nothing kills the domestic vibe like a wait at the checkout line, the final transaction that punctuates a purchase is currently being remodeled. In a luxury boutique, your credit card is now likely to be whisked away \u2014 the grubby reality of commerce happens out of sight \u2014 only to be discreetly, and somewhat apologetically, returned in a supple leather binder or on a zebrawood tray. In the more democratic Apple store, the exchange is decentralized: Scan your purchase on your phone, then waltz out of the store unassailed. It\u2019s like everything is yours already.While we may, in pursuit of a bargain, suffer the cacophony of Century 21 or allow Ikea to swallow us whole and squeeze us through its labyrinthine intestine, the relationship between the big commercial store and the luxury object is fraught. That ultra-precious handbag tends to hemorrhage aura when set in context of innumerable clones. When luxury goods are offered in a simulated domestic setting, the brutal impersonality of mass production and merchandising is disguised behind the fantasy of exclusivity. Intimacy equals desirability.There was a time when bigness was in. Big meant choice. Big meant entertainment. Big meant the whole world in a box. Malls touted square footage as the metric of shopping exhilaration. Macy\u2019s Herald Square billed itself as the \u201cworld\u2019s largest store.\u201d In the early decades of the last century, shoppers entered the fabled Wanamaker\u2019s department store in Philadelphia through a towering Corinthian portico to browse in a great Roman-Doric court, a fantastical Egyptian hall, and Byzantine, Empire and Art Nouveau period rooms. Merchandise from across the globe was displayed with exhibitions of Old Master paintings and exotic objets d\u2019art. The grand department store was a portal to the world, the commercial twin of the great encyclopedic civic museums, where uplifting and educating the masses was serious business.At the same time, Sears, Roebuck & Co. and Montgomery Ward were delivering bigness to the rural masses through the original home shopping network: consolidated mail-order catalogs, some over 700 pages, that offered everything from button-hooks and brassieres to motor buggies, delivered directly to their customer\u2019s doorstep via the U.S.P.S. An early Sears catalog cover, boasting \u201cOur trade reaches around the world,\u201d featured a fair-skinned maiden, addressed envelope in hand, floating over a bucolic American farmstead astride a cornucopia spilling furniture, guns, pianos and clothing. The mail-order catalog provided nationwide domestic access to a previously unimaginable selection of products. Inventory was king.By the \u201960s, Sears alone reportedly accounted for almost 1 percent of the U.S. gross national product, employed 350,000 people and provided credit cards to over half the population. (The hippie-domestic Whole Earth Catalog was launched as that era\u2019s proto-Brooklyn, D.I.Y. alternative \u2014 the original Etsy.) Fast-forward to the now-familiar narrative of the exurban big-box revolution. Walmart became the world\u2019s largest retailer and QVC and Home Shopping Network began to deliver 24/7 in-home access to cubic zirconium, spot remover and miracle knife sets to anyone with a television and telephone.And then something came along that was bigger than all that came before it, with the real potential to access the whole earth, and everything changed. The internet made shopping the world not only a reality but an essential feature of everyday life for millions of people. Enter global shopping with a hyperlocal interface: as local as your own couch. Amazon has out-bigged the biggest big box \u2014 adding 17 million square feet of warehouse space just last year \u2014 and in achieving such massive scale, fomented the expectation that anything you could possibly need is always in stock, immediately available and just a keystroke away.Now even the keystroke has been disrupted. With the recent innovation of Amazon Dash buttons \u2014 branded clickers that automatically place an order for a specific product \u2014 the home is the interface and the pantry has been outsourced. Out of Tide? Just hit the button on the Dash device, and that familiar orange box will appear on your doorstep in a matter of minutes by way of a friendly union-free drone. As it is estimated that the average American woman uses a mere fraction of her wardrobe and wears a new purchase only a handful of times, that logic of linked distribution will almost certainly spread to your closet. It may be only a matter of time before we have a Chanel Dash button, a Calvin Dash button. Winter clothes storage in the summer? Forget it. Out of style? Just send it back. Same with sizing. Your wardrobe will follow your climate, your body and your mood. All that warehouse space is an extension of your own personal space.As our shelves and closets are sensored for automatic fulfillment, and our pantries communicate directly with the public larders to keep them perpetually brimming with the bounty of American plenty, there will be ever less reason to leave the comfortable confines of our homes. The comprehensive sites such as Amazon and Zappos, and the curated ones like Net-a-Porter and Yoox, provide our great database of commodities. As product research and price comparison are relocated from physical spaces to virtual ones \u2014 it\u2019s called a browser for a reason \u2014 the function of stores shifts from a site of discovery and transaction to something else ... what, exactly, is at the moment hotly contested.Bigness, at least in terms of luxury, seems to be a dwindling proposition. Discovery and selection in the physical world can never match the reach of the internet with its huge-scale aggregators, branded e-commerce shops, curatorial shopping sites, and the long trail of small boutiques and Etsy home-crafters offering anything and everything. What the shop can offer, however, are things difficult to achieve online: an intimate relationship with things, a haptic appreciation of materiality, a personal interaction with a sympathetic helper, an experience that contextualizes objects, a place to socialize with like-minded connoisseurs and, most importantly, a respite from the avalanche of too much stuff. Consider that the much-vaunted Apple store, which has the highest profit per-square-foot of any store in the United States, essentially offers variants of four products: telephone, watch, music player and laptop. In an ironic reversal, stores now may have to offer less to stay relevant.If we\u2019ve become used to, and adept at, shopping from bed, and as our homes are increasingly conjoined to distant warehouses that monitor their status, shops themselves may become extensions of the social function of our domestic space. As simple fulfillment of household commodities becomes automated, browsing, research and cost comparison become the prelude to shopping, not its raison d\u2019\u00eatre. A visit to the store may revert back to John Wanamaker\u2019s original dream: shopping as a form of education and cultural edification. Maybe we learn best in the places that we feel most comfortable in: places that feel like our own living room, only nicer.Oh, and whatever happened to Wanamaker\u2019s? In Manhattan, the gargantuan old department store now houses a corporate headquarters ... for Facebook.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "We\u2019re Here! RB Leipzig\u2019s Rise to Bundesliga Isn\u2019t Welcomed by All", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLEIPZIG, Germany \u2014 A little more than three years ago, the man in charge of the most ambitious project in European soccer sat in front of a promising young player in a Cypriot hotel and told him the future.At the time, the man, Ralf Rangnick, a well-traveled German coach with an urbane, faintly academic air, seemed an unlikely clairvoyant. And his pitch to Yussuf Poulsen, a young Danish forward, did not seem to be a strong one. Rangnick\u2019s club, RB Leipzig, was attempting to escape the fourth tier of German soccer. It did not have a famous name, or much of a history. His predictions, too, struck Poulsen as distinctly outlandish: promotion all the way to a place among Germany\u2019s elite in just three seasons.\u201cHe said this club was the club of the future,\u201d Poulsen recalled last week.Poulsen signed on, and the rapid ascent Rangnick had laid out in the hotel \u2014 a romantic rise or a cash-fueled corporate push, depending on one\u2019s point of view \u2014 continued.On Sunday, the final part of Rangnick\u2019s prophecy was set to come to pass: Poulsen and his RB Leipzig teammates traveled to Hoffenheim for the club\u2019s first-ever game in the Bundesliga, the completion of its relentless rise. RB Leipzig can now count Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund as its peers. The future, exactly as and when Rangnick predicted it, has arrived.Not everyone in Germany shares Poulsen\u2019s delight at the dawn of the new age. Many in the country recoil from a future in the shape of RB Leipzig, a corporate creation younger than even the most junior players in its academy. Every step of the club\u2019s remarkable rise \u2014 its founding in 2009 and then its moves through the patchwork pitches of the lower leagues to the rarefied air of the elite \u2014 has been taken against a backdrop of controversy and contempt, rancor and rage.Poulsen can reel off all the protests he has witnessed. Some have been violent \u2014 the team\u2019s bus was attacked with stones after his debut, against Hallescher F.C. \u2014 but more often, they have been visual.The problem is encapsulated in the RB Leipzig name. Officially, RB stands for RasenBallsport \u2014 a neologism meaning \u201clawn ball\u201d \u2014 but it takes only one glance at the team, its uniforms, its stadium or its $30 million training base to see through the disguise. To many, RB Leipzig will never be anything more than another marketing venture started by the Austrian energy-drink maker Red Bull.The antipathy dates to the club\u2019s birth. Dietrich Mateschitz, the billionaire Red Bull founder, already had soccer clubs in Salzburg, in his native Austria, and New York, as well as interests in Formula One auto racing and extreme sports.But he had wanted, for some time, to add a German franchise to his slate. He had held talks with teams in Munich, D\u00fcsseldorf and Hamburg, but Leipzig had always been his first choice. It is not hard to see why.There is no major club within 150 miles \u2014 the nearest Bundesliga rival is Hertha Berlin \u2014 and the city, once part of East Germany, is a boomtown known to locals as Hypezig. Leipzig had been extensively remodeled after unification, and its population was expanding, from 450,000 at the end of the 1990s to a projected 600,000 in 2020. A slew of international companies had followed. BMW, DHL, Porsche and Amazon each have a presence in the city; there is a vibrant technology start-up scene, too.The city also had a new stadium, refurbished for the 2006 World Cup, sitting empty. Neither of the two local teams had played in the Bundesliga since 1994; both were now toiling away in the twilight of the semiprofessional lower leagues, their names stained by fan violence and far-right politics.Indeed, East German football in general had withered since the Berlin Wall fell. The year Mateschitz established RB Leipzig \u2014 by buying and rebranding a fifth-division team called SSV Markranst\u00e4dt \u2014 was also the year Energie Cottbus, the last team from the old German Democratic Republic to play at the top level, was relegated. This was a city, and a region, crying out for an elite team.Unlike the English Premier League, though, where outside investors are welcomed and the game\u2019s authorities are officially \u201cownership neutral,\u201d Germany jealously protects what is known as its 50+1 model, in which clubs are regarded as social institutions that must be majority-owned by their members. Red Bull\u2019s arrival ran counter to all that.Out of respect to the rules, the club does have members, but only 17, each of whom pays 800 euros a year (just under $900) for a share. Bayern Munich, by contrast, has more than 224,000 members, at a much more affordable \u20ac60. As with the name, the sleight of hand was interpreted not as a nod to tradition, but as a slap in the face.RB Leipzig acknowledges that the manner of its conception did not make it popular, but its chairman, Oliver Mintzlaff, insisted that only a \u201cminority of hard-core supporters\u201d actively opposed it. That is, perhaps, playing it down a little. Seven years removed from the days when clubs refused to play RB Leipzig, even in friendlies, anger still simmers.Thirty minutes up the road in Halle, home of Hallescher, the club\u2019s ultra fans wear T-shirts bearing the slogan \u201cTradition Hat Einen Namen\u201d: \u201cTradition Has a Name.\u201d Historically, Hallescher\u2019s biggest rival was F.C. Magdeburg. Now, said Julius Kappen, \u201cwe hate RB more.\u201dHe explained: \u201cThey are just money. A team is the colors, the badge, the identity.\u201d\u201cBut look at the name,\u201d said Marko Hofmann, a schoolteacher who volunteers with Lokomotive. \u201cHoffenheim 1899 \u2014 they existed before Hopp. It is the same with Wolfsburg and Leverkusen \u2014 they existed initially to play football. RB is just marketing. It exists only to sell more energy drinks. And what happens if they lose interest, or if Dieter Mateschitz dies? What if they decide to leave the town? Or if they examine the books and say it is not working? What happens then?\u201dThat, those inside RB Leipzig maintain, should not be a worry. Their future, as they see it, rests on being sustainable. Red Bull, according to Mintzlaff, volunteered to sign \u201ccontracts stating a commitment for more than 20 years\u201d with the German league authorities, the D.F.L., while he emphasized the work being done to \u201cbuild a connection\u201d with the city.\u201cNot everyone was happy in the beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cThey wanted to know what this was, what we were doing. But now it feels like part of the city. I love tradition. It is hugely important to our culture. But you must be allowed to start something new, without a tradition. Time is running, time is changing, and we have to be able to move on.\u201dThis is more than just posturing. For all the controversy about the source of the team\u2019s wealth, it is hard to argue with how RB Leipzig has spent it. Its training base is ultramodern, with individual relaxation spaces for the players; a light, airy cafeteria; and an indoor, artificial-turf sprint track to gauge players\u2019 strength and speed.Terrence Boyd, the team\u2019s American forward, described the facilities as \u201camong the best you could find anywhere, a huge draw for the club.\u201dWhat Mintzlaff describes as RB\u2019s \u201cphilosophy,\u201d instituted by Rangnick, centers exclusively on youth. The club tries to sign only players between the ages of 17 and 24, and there is a stated dedication to producing as many young, homegrown prospects as possible. The club is not, Mintzlaff said, \u201cjust buying players.\u201d Its style of play \u2014 indicative of the philosophy of Rangnick, regarded by many as the godfather of the German pressing game \u2014 is attractive and expansive.The city seems to have responded. RB Leipzig has sold about 20,000 season tickets for the coming Bundesliga campaign. \u201cWe could easily have sold 25,000,\u201d Mintzlaff said. Only a handful of the most traditional Bundesliga clubs can match those figures. Mintzlaff says RB Leipzig is proud of the euphoria in the city and the region.The rest of the league, too, is coming around.\u201cI was on a plane with Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, the chief executive of Bayern Munich, on Wednesday,\u201d Mintzlaff said. \u201cHe said, and I agree entirely, that it would be awesome for Bayern to have more competition. The secret of the Premier League is that there are five or six strong teams. Here, it is just Bayern and Dortmund. We need more. It is about having a competitive league, not just one club that wins every year. With the power of Red Bull and a lot of hard work, in a few years, we could help that.\u201dIn the meantime, RB Leipzig\u2019s players have grown used to the hostility, and so have their fans. It has died down over time, if not yet disappeared. \u201cFor a while, Hoffenheim were the enemy of the nation,\u201d said David Grabow, one of the 20,000 to buy a season ticket. \u201cBut after awhile, people have accepted they are here to stay.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China, Not Silicon Valley, Is Cutting Edge in Mobile Tech", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "Supported byAll of these developments have something in common: The technology was first popularized in China.Silicon Valley has long been the world\u2019s tech capital: It birthed social networking and iPhones and spread those tech products across the globe. The rap on China has been that it always followed in the Valley\u2019s footsteps as government censorship abetted the rise of local versions of Google, YouTube and Twitter.But China\u2019s tech industry \u2014 particularly its mobile businesses \u2014 has in some ways pulled ahead of the United States. Some Western tech companies, even the behemoths, are turning to Chinese firms for ideas.\u201cWe just see China as further ahead,\u201d said Ted Livingston, the founder of Kik, which is headquartered in Waterloo, Ontario.The shift suggests that China could have a greater say in the global tech industry\u2019s direction. Already in China, more people use their mobile devices to pay their bills, order services, watch videos and find dates than anywhere else in the world. Mobile payments in the country last year surpassed those in the United States. By some estimates, loans from a new breed of informal online banks called peer-to-peer lenders did too.The future of online payments and engagements can be found at Liu Zheng\u2019s noodle shop in central Beijing. Liu Xiu\u2019e, 60, and her neighbor, Zhang Lixin, 55, read about the noodle shop on WeChat. Then they ordered and paid for their lunches and took and posted selfies of themselves outside the restaurant, all using the same app.Liu Zheng, who is not related to Liu Xiu\u2019e, said the automated ordering and payments meant he could cut down on wages for waiters. \u201cIn the future, we will only need one waiter to help in the restaurant and one to help with seating,\u201d Mr. Liu said.Before Venmo became the app for millennials to transfer money in the United States, both young and old in China were investing, reimbursing each other, paying bills,and buying products from stores with smartphone-based digital wallets.\u201cQuite frankly, the trope that China copies the U.S. hasn\u2019t been true for years, and in mobile it\u2019s the opposite: The U.S. often copies China,\u201d said Ben Thompson, the founder of the tech research firm Stratechery. \u201cFor the Facebook Messenger app, for example, the best way to understand their road map is to look at WeChat.\u201dA Facebook spokesman declined to comment. Tencent did not respond to requests for comment.Executives from companies like Facebook and smaller rivals like Kik are trying to replicate what has emerged in China: dominant online platforms where users will spend much of their time. Much of that effort is focused on chat.\u201cThe cool thing about chat is it becomes an operating system for your daily life,\u201d Mr. Livingston said. \u201cGoing up to a vending machine, ordering food, getting a cab: Chat can power those interactions, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing with WeChat.\u201dThe biggest advantage for China\u2019s tech industry, according to many analysts, is that it was able to fill a vacuum after the country essentially created much of its economy from scratch following the end of the Cultural Revolution, in 1976. Unlike in the United States, where banks and retailers already have strong holds on customers, China\u2019s state-run lenders are inefficient, and retailers never expanded broadly enough to serve a fast-growing middle class.Many Chinese also never bought a personal computer, meaning smartphones are the primary \u2014 and often first \u2014 computing device for the more than 600 million who have them in China.\u201cThe U.S. was first to credit cards, and everyone there has a personal computer. But China, where everyone is on their phones all the time, is now ahead in mobile commerce and mobile payments by virtue of leapfrogging the PC and credit cards,\u201d Mr. Thompson said.Chinese companies also approach the internet in a different way. In the United States, tech firms emphasize simplicity in their apps. But in China, its three major internet companies \u2014 Alibaba, Baidu and the WeChat parent Tencent \u2014 compete to create a single app with as many functions as they can stuff into it.On Alibaba\u2019s Taobao shopping app, people can also buy groceries, buy credits for online games, scan coupons and find deals at stores nearby. Baidu\u2019s mapping app lets users order an Uber, reserve a restaurant or hotel, order in food, buy movie tickets and find just about any type of store nearby.Tencent has opened up WeChat to other companies, allowing them to create apps within WeChat. Ebaoyang \u2014 a start-up that enables people to order oil changes for their cars directly on smartphones \u2014 was at first almost totally reliant on WeChat to attract business. Gao Feng, one of Ebaoyang\u2019s founders, said the company still relied on the app for 50 percent of its payments and 20 percent of new customers.\u201cWe started from WeChat. So it was our main, original source for getting customers,\u201d he said.Between fees for its services and money it makes through online games, WeChat manages to generate $7 in revenue per user each year, according to Nomura. The app has roughly 700 million users, more than the total number of smartphone users in China, in part because some users are outside the country and in part because people have multiple accounts.Much of that comes not from ads, as it might in the United States, but from spending on games, services and goods sold on the app. Those models may not translate from one market to the other, but the two can still borrow from each other, said Carmen Chang, a partner at the venture capital firm New Enterprise Associates.\u201cChina was able to develop a lot of innovative business models, which arose in a different kind of economy,\u201d said Ms. Chang, who spends time in both China and in Menlo Park, Calif. \u201cWhether or not we admit it here in Silicon Valley, it\u2019s had an impact on us and our thinking.\u201dCao Li in Beijing contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Daily Report: More Clean Energy, Brought to You by the Cloud", "Date": "2016-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsThe cloud, as it turns out, may have a very green lining.A prime reason for this is the growing demand from its cloud computing centers, where Apple keeps its customers\u2019 music, photos and much more.On this front, Apple joins a number of other cloud providers, who collectively may change the face of energy production by increasing demand for renewable energy.Big cloud-computing companies are building facilities on an unparalleled scale, and at a time when few others are increasing demand. Dominion Virginia Power, which supplies perhaps the world\u2019s greatest concentration of data centers, reported that overall demand rose 1 percent last year, but demand from data centers rose 9 percent.Amazon Web Services has since committed to obtaining 100 percent of its power from renewable sources. Last year the company purchased a 250,000-panel, 80-megawatt plant in Virginia, which it later sold to Dominion.Other data centers have long been situated near big dams, which provide cheap as well as green power. Lots of building is happening in Iowa, Texas and elsewhere in America\u2019s great wind corridor, to encourage the construction of more wind-driven facilities.Remote locations have other benefits. \u201cWhen your nearest neighbor is 100 acres away, you don\u2019t get as many complaints about the power lines,\u201d said Joe Kava, who heads Google\u2019s data center operations.There are signs it is affecting the way utilities plan future construction. American Electric Power, which operates in 11 states, has said it will add 6,300 megawatts of new wind power and 3,100 megawatts of new solar generation before 2033. An AEP official told me that much of this was attributable to demand from data centers.For many of these companies, it\u2019s not just about saving the planet; power has moved from an incidental cost to a main determinant of profitability. Like nothing else, that has affected the operation of data centers in ways that may improve other big companies\u2019 power consumption.The traditional measure of data center efficiency is power usage effectiveness, or P.U.E. This measures how much power goes into a data center and how much of that is used by computing equipment. For a poorly run center, this number can be 2.0 or higher, meaning it takes two watts of power to put one watt into a computer.Together, these companies are building with their clouds a new kind of industrial infrastructure. It would be something if it also reshaped our power usage for the better.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "London, as You\u2019ve Never Heard It Before", "Date": "2016-08-05", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 On a recent Saturday, Ian Rawes, a part-time deliveryman, spent several hours walking around London with two microphones strapped to his head. He went into a vegetable market and got so caught up recording the sound of birds in its rafters that he almost got hit by a cabbage-laden forklift hurtling toward him.He went to a park, only to decide that the stream dribbling through it wasn\u2019t worth recording. Then he headed to Stamford Hill, a traditionally Hasidic Jewish community, where he wove around men in towering fur hats, capturing snatches of their conversations in Yiddish.\u201cA good morning\u2019s work, two more tiny fragments of the mosaic that is London,\u201d he said as he took off the microphones.The thrill of the chase aside, Mr. Rawes says he is performing a vital historical service. \u201cAs time goes by and cultural, technological, economic conditions change, these recordings will become more and more interesting,\u201d he said.\u201cI mean, could you imagine if you could hear the sounds of 18th-century London today?\u201d he said. \u201cEven if it was just the sound of people spitting in the street, coughing \u2014 and a lot of people were sick back then, so it probably would be \u2014 it\u2019d be fascinating.\u201dMr. Rawes was working at the British Library\u2019s sound archive about 10 years ago when he stumbled across tapes of the sounds of every bus route in the county of Yorkshire, complete with dense handwritten notes.\u201cWe\u2019d probably now diagnose the person who made them as on the autism spectrum,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it made me think, \u2018God, if he can do that, there must be something in London to record.\u2019\u201dIt has proved more difficult than expected to find dramatic sounds in London, Mr. Rawes said. \u201cThere are some places you can go, and you\u2019d have to be spectacularly incompetent not to make an interesting recording,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Amazon rain forest at night, for example.\u201dHe added, \u201cIn cities, it\u2019s harder to find great sounds, unless you love the sound of cars.\u201dField recording has a long history. In 1889, an 8-year-old German, Ludwig Koch, made the first known recording of birdsongs using a phonograph that his parents gave him.Musicians have long incorporated such recordings into their work, but Mr. Rawes and others like him are fixated on the raw sounds themselves.Why do people listen to her records? \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s still very difficult for me to go to a dinner party and say, \u2018I compose what\u2019s loosely called music from field recordings.\u2019 It\u2019s not the average way to make a living. But more people are getting interested in nature, and more listen to experimental music, so naturally they discover it.\u201dThe most prominent field recordist today is Chris Watson, a soft-spoken 62-year-old from Sheffield, England, who has won numerous awards including for his work on BBC nature documentaries.Mr. Watson has been making recordings since he was 11, when his parents gave him a reel-to-reel tape recorder, and he left it on a bird feeder to see if he could hear what birds sounded like eating.\u201cI was amazed when I played it back,\u201d he said. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t believe you could eavesdrop onto a world where you could never be yourself. I\u2019m still excited by that idea.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the sound of them rubbing their penises beneath their abdomens to sing to attract females,\u201d Mr. Watson said with a boyish smile. \u201cI love the fact that in this relatively tranquil environment, all that noise is going on below the surface.\u201dAt a recent performance of the town-moor piece in a movie theater in Newcastle, the audience sat in darkness, surrounded by speakers. \u201cIt\u2019s like the old clich\u00e9 that radio is better than television because the pictures are better,\u201d Mr. Watson told the audience. \u201cSound surrounds you. It releases your imagination.\u201dMr. Watson says he seeks to capture the \u201cspirit of places\u201d in his music, but he also sees the world as being filled with breathtaking sounds that instruments cannot reproduce that more people should hear.\u201cEveryone should listen more,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they should just start with what they\u2019ve got.

Just Don\u2019t Call Her a Sci-Fi Writer.", "Date": "2016-08-28", "News": "Supported byPORTLAND, Ore. \u2014 If you\u2019re a big-deal American writer, you hope for a couple of things to cement your legacy. Finding out one fine October morning that your presence is being requested in Sweden would be ideal. Almost as good is enshrinement in the Library of America, the closest thing to immortality between hardcovers.The Library of America usually restricts itself to Melville, Twain, Hawthorne and the other distinguished dead. But a handful of times it has been so sure of a novelist\u2019s importance that its austere black volumes started appearing while the writer was still alive. Eudora Welty, Saul Bellow and Philip Roth got the call.Ursula K. Le Guin is now on this very shortlist. The library\u2019s original idea was to begin with some of her classic science fiction. But she pressed it to start instead with a volume of her lesser-known work.\u201cThere\u2019s some innate arrogance here: I want to do it my way,\u201d Ms. Le Guin said in an interview at her home here. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be reduced to being \u2018the sci-fi writer.\u2019 People are always trying to push me off the literary scene, and to hell with it.\u201dShe chuckled. \u201cI won\u2019t be pushed.\u201dThe result is that Ms. Le Guin\u2019s \u201cThe Complete Orsinia\u201d is being published on Sept. 6 as Library of America Vol. 281. It includes a little-known novel, \u201cMalafrena,\u201d set in an imaginary Central European country, and 13 related stories. The material spans the first half of Ms. Le Guin\u2019s career, from her first published story in 1961 to 1990.It is definitely not science fiction, and not quite fantasy either. Ms. Le Guin\u2019s more casual fans, she acknowledged, might be surprised by it \u2014 a realistic work set in the early 19th century, a tale of a hopeful revolutionary at a moment when revolutions are impossible.\u201cSomeone who pigeonholed me firmly will say, \u2018What the hell?\u2019 But that\u2019s their problem.\u201dMs. Le Guin is 86. She says \u201cwhat the hell\u201d a lot. She is too old, she says, to get on airplanes or even do events in Portland beyond an occasional bookstore appearance. So the world comes to her \u2014 up a hill, past a sign marked \u201cno outlet,\u201d across a bridge spanning a ravine too deep for trolls.Her 1899 house is shielded by pink, yellow and red roses. In the living room there is a volume of word puzzles on a table and the books Ms. Le Guin and her husband, Charles, a retired historian, are reading aloud at night (\u201cTwo Years Before the Mast\u201d and the poetry of Theodore Roethke). There is not a clue that anyone who lives here is a writer, much less America\u2019s greatest living science fiction writer.This early work was done at the margins of the culture. \u201cA Wizard of Earthsea\u201d (1968), now regarded as one of the great fantasies of the era, was published by a small press in Berkeley, Calif. \u201cThe Left Hand of Darkness\u201d (1969), probably her most influential work, was issued as a 95-cent mass-market paperback.\u201cI published as a genre writer when genre was not literature,\u201d she said. \u201cI paid the price, you could say. Don DeLillo, who comes off as literary without question, takes the award over me\u201d \u2014 at the 1985 National Book Awards \u2014 \u201cbecause I published in genre and he didn\u2019t. Also, he\u2019s a man and I\u2019m a woman.\u201d (Mr. DeLillo won for \u201cWhite Noise\u201d; her book, \u201cAlways Coming Home,\u201d was about a far-future California utopia.)Mellowing with age is clearly not Ms. Le Guin\u2019s style. In 2014, she received the National Book Foundation\u2019s Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters. She spent six months writing her six-minute speech.\u201cWho was I to spit in the publishers\u2019 punch bowl at the annual industry party?\u201d she recounts in \u201cWords Are My Matter,\u201d a collection of nonfiction appearing this fall from Small Beer Press. \u201cWell, I was, in fact, the one to do it. So I did it.\u201dShe used her speech to decry \u201ccommodity profiteers\u201d who sold writers \u201clike deodorant, and tell us what to publish, what to write.\u201d She criticized our \u201cobsessive technologies\u201d that promote fear and greed.The speech, and her outrage, went viral. \u201cA writer in her mid-80s simply has less to lose,\u201d she said. \u201cAn author in midcareer who defies the hegemony of Google and Amazon, and names their immoral or unfair practices as such, takes an immediate risk of vengeance from them and of enmity from fellow writers who are cozy with them. I\u2019m taking the same risks, but what the hell. My work is out there \u2014 visible, existent.\u201d\u201cThat story is both a call and a practice for Le Guin,\u201d Mr. Diaz said. \u201cShe has spent all these decades trying to chart a path for those who wish to walk away from Omelas \u2014 also known as the horror of our civilization.\u201d\u201cThe Complete Orsinia\u201d is Ms. Le Guin in a quieter key. \u201cThe editorial challenge of the Library of America is to strike a balance,\u201d said Max Rudin, the library\u2019s publisher. \u201cOn the one hand to publish writers and works that are indisputably part of the American canon, and on the other hand to publish books that stretch people\u2019s imagination of what great American writing is.\u201dIn the introduction, she quotes from a 1975 notebook in which she wrote that much of her work was concerned with one central notion: \u201cTrue pilgrimage consists in coming home.\u201d The hero of \u201cMalafrena\u201d must leave his provincial farm only to find it again.\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between the circle and the spiral,\u201d Ms. Le Guin said. \u201cWe say the Earth has a circular orbit around the sun, but of course it doesn\u2019t. You never come back to the same place, you just come back to the same point on the spiral. That image is very deep in my thinking.\u201d\u201cOrsinia\u201d has another spiral: As Ms. Le Guin\u2019s works are being put in the canon, she has largely stopped writing. \u201cThe fiction isn\u2019t coming. You can\u2019t get water from a dry well.\u201d She still writes poetry, which is a consolation.There remains that other big legacy-cementing possibility. Last year, Ms. Le Guin was given Nobel odds of 25-1. Her conclusion: \u201cAll I have to do in the next 25 years is outlive the other 24 writers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Everyone Despises SolarCity Deal, Except Tesla Shareholders", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseCorporate governance experts are up in arms, because Tesla\u2019s visionary founder, the entrepreneur Elon Musk, also founded SolarCity and is the largest shareholder in both companies. SolarCity\u2019s chief executive is Mr. Musk\u2019s cousin. There are overlapping directors. Critics called it blatant self-dealing and accused Mr. Musk of using valuable Tesla shares to bail out a struggling SolarCity.James S. Chanos \u2014 an investor who, it should be noted, is betting against both stocks \u2014 called it a \u201cshameful example of corporate governance at its worst.\u201dBut what if the critics are wrong?Many auto industry experts also said the idea of combining Tesla, an electric-car manufacturer, with SolarCity, which makes solar energy panels, makes no strategic sense. Even if energy generation, storage and an auto powertrain are a seamless product, so-called vertical integration, in which one manufacturer makes all the components, was the old Henry Ford model and later, General Motors\u2019. That approach has gone down in automotive history as a colossal failure.Adam Jonas, the influential auto industry analyst at Morgan Stanley, slashed his price target for Tesla and wrote in a note to clients that potential rewards would not adequately compensate investors for the greater risks and cash flow drain. Expanding into a non-auto business like solar energy exposes Tesla to \u201cuntested cost, competitive and regulatory forces,\u201d he warned.Perhaps the harshest verdict came from the market itself: Tesla shares dropped more than 10 percent the day the deal was announced.Mr. Musk \u201cwent overnight from being a genius to an idiot,\u201d said Joseph Dennison, portfolio manager at Zevenbergen Capital Investments, a large Tesla shareholder.Largely overlooked in the din, however, is that few, if any, of Tesla\u2019s harshest critics are Tesla\u2019s current shareholders. And they are the only ones who truly matter, because they\u2019ll have a vote on the deal and it\u2019s their money on the line.Tesla\u2019s four biggest shareholders after Mr. Musk are mutual fund managers, including the industry giants Fidelity, Vanguard and T. Rowe Price. None have announced how they\u2019ll vote, but they have a history of supporting management generally, and specifically Mr. Musk.Even before the deal was announced, a Fidelity portfolio manager, Gavin Baker, told investors, \u201cWe are fans not just of Tesla products but of the concepts underpinning the firm and potential future partnerships ahead of it.\u201dRonald Baron, founder of Baron Capital, which owns 1.5 million Tesla shares, said his initial reaction was, \u201cWhy on earth would anyone want to do this? Can\u2019t you buy these panels much cheaper in China?\u201dHe said he had looked into investing in SolarCity several times, and each time decided to pass (a wise decision considering that SolarCity shares have fallen more than 50 percent this year.)But after further research and discussions with Tesla management, Mr. Baron told me his concerns had been largely assuaged. \u201cUntil I read the proxy, I can\u2019t tell you how I\u2019m going to vote,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the more we researched this, the more sense it made to combine Tesla with solar panels. We believe they can make better products, make them more efficiently, and realize tremendous savings by selling the two products together.\u201dOther investors have also been reconsidering the merits of the deal. Tesla shares have more than recovered what they lost after the deal was announced. And investors brushed off an announcement on Wednesday of worse-than-expected quarterly losses, focusing instead on higher vehicle production and new orders.Tesla tried to do its best to allay concerns about Mr. Musk\u2019s conflict of interest. Mr. Musk will not vote, nor will other insiders who own shares in both companies, a step that was not mandated by law.Tesla maintains that various committees of directors that it says are independent vigorously negotiated terms of the deal, and that Mr. Musk did not know the price before it was agreed on. When the deal became final on Monday, the price was slightly lower than that announced in June, suggesting some genuine haggling went on.But realistically, Mr. Musk\u2019s dominant role in both companies means that \u201cit\u2019s an intractable problem,\u201d said Charles M. Elson, an expert in corporate governance at the University of Delaware. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to resolve this. The only way would be not to do it.\u201dTesla says that would elevate corporate governance purity at the expense of common sense. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to take every appropriate step\u201d to minimize the conflict issues, Todd A. Maron, Tesla\u2019s general counsel, told me this week. \u201cBut if there are synergies, which there are, and we can make the best product under one company\u2019s ownership, and we can persuade the independent shareholders to support the deal, there shouldn\u2019t be a strict prohibition just because someone is on both sides.\u201dMr. Dennison of Zevenbergen Capital said that focusing on conflicts \u201cis missing the bigger picture.\u201d\u201cTo make these future products as good, integrated and efficient as possible,\u201d he added, \u201cyou need the two companies working together.\u201d He said his firm had not announced how it would vote, but he has typically sided with management.From Zip2 to OpenAI, a look at the entrepreneur\u2019s many companies.As for making its own batteries and solar panels and being vertically integrated, Tesla maintains it had little choice. \u201cTesla does not believe in vertical integration as an objective in and of itself,\u201d Mr. Maron said, but \u201cgoes down that path because there\u2019s no better option.\u201d Tesla has said its planned auto production volume would consume \u201ctoday\u2019s entire worldwide production of lithium ion batteries.\u201d\u201cCreate a smoothly integrated and beautiful solar-roof-with-battery product that just works, empowering the individual as their own utility, and then scale that throughout the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t do this well if Tesla and SolarCity are different companies, which is why we need to combine and break down the barriers inherent to being separate companies.\u201dAdmittedly, that\u2019s a long-term vision that has little to do with the latest quarterly earnings. If Tesla owners were plugging their cars into outlets with electricity from coal-fired power plants, there would not be much sustainability to get excited about.\u201cMusk\u2019s vision from Day 1 10 years ago was to accelerate sustainable energy, \u201c said Mr. Dennison. \u201cThat\u2019s a much bigger vision than building cars.\u201dAnd vision is what Tesla\u2019s shareholders are buying into, just as Amazon investors put their faith in Jeff Bezos. That\u2019s why, for all the controversy, the SolarCity deal will almost surely be approved by Tesla shareholders.\u201cIf you\u2019re investing in a Musk business, you\u2019re investing in something that hasn\u2019t happened yet, so it\u2019s risky,\u201d said Mr. Baron. \u201cBut I love the guy. He\u2019s totally focused. He\u2019s already accomplished what people said could never be done.\u201dMr. Dennison agreed. \u201cYou\u2019re investing in the people who make and execute decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is obviously tied to a bigger picture and a longer-term road map than most. But Tesla management has executed on all the goals they\u2019ve laid out. I\u2019d say this is an investment based on faith, but not blind faith.\u201dThe Common Sense column on Aug. 5, about the proposed merger of Tesla Motors and SolarCity, described SolarCity\u2019s product incorrectly. The company makes solar energy generating panels, not storage devices.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cloud Computing Brings Sprawling Centers, but Few Jobs, to Small Towns", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "Supported byBoydton JournalBOYDTON, Va. \u2014 A giant Microsoft facility just outside this very small town hides behind a quarter-mile berm and a guard house, across the highway from the rubble of a demolished prison.Behind the berm, six unmarked hangars each hold tens of thousands of computer servers. Microsoft has cleared enough scrub trees and vines for at least 15 of these buildings, and six more are already under construction.One thing there isn\u2019t much of at this Microsoft complex, one single computer data center, is long-term work. Microsoft says it might have \u201cseveral dozen\u201d employees in a place like this. They are mostly elite computer workers who tend not to come from Boydton, which lost a lot of good jobs when nearby factories closed and the prison shut down.So it is in a number of small towns across the country, as technology giants like Amazon, Google and Microsoft race to build networks of unprecedented size to provide services over the internet, a technology trend known as cloud computing. Local people, along with many economists and officials, often think these data centers are a key to an industrial revival. But the reality is less impressive.\u201cI\u2019ve worked on a lot of nuclear power plants, and these things are a lot bigger than that,\u201d said E. W. Gregory, the head of the local electrical workers\u2019 union. But \u201cthe first thing they put in was a guard shack and a fence. I\u2019ve filled rooms with people looking for entry-level work. None of it lasts.\u201dThe companies come to places like Boydton for basics like land, water and electricity. Even with low local wages, people are a high-cost item. As small as the staffs at these mammoth facilities are, companies say, perhaps a third of the company jobs will eventually be filled by robots.Google started building in eastern Oregon to be near cheap hydroelectric power on the Columbia River, and most recently it has focused on Iowa, Alabama and Tennessee. Microsoft has a center in Wyoming, and it bought a nine-hole golf course as part of a complex near West Des Moines, Iowa. Amazon recently built similar giant facilities on the outer reaches of Columbus, Ohio, and Dulles, Va.\u201cA lot of this stuff is put in rural parts of the country that used to be part of a manufacturing economy\u201d that has gone overseas, said Bill Coughran, a partner at the venture investment firm Sequoia Capital who ran much of Google\u2019s big engineering for eight years. \u201cTextiles and furniture created a big power grid in the south. Then those jobs went away.\u201dThat\u2019s been the story for Boydton, population 430, in the middle of tobacco country a few miles from the North Carolina border. The prison across from the Microsoft center closed in 2012. A nearby Burlington Industries textile plant that employed more than 2,000 shut in 2002. It was razed in 2012.The South Virginia tobacco economy collapsed as Americans cut back on smoking. But in 1999, Virginia used some of the $4.1 billion it received in a settlement with cigarette makers to build high-speed fiber-optic lines throughout the region.The broadband drew Microsoft, along with some financial perks. Mecklenburg County, which received $2.1 million from the state for the project, has given Microsoft 350 acres and offset personal property taxes by 82.5 percent, according to Wayne Carter, the county administrator.Initially, Apple, which is building a big cloud center for consumers\u2019 photos and music, wanted the Boydton site, but it went across the border to North Carolina, which promised tax breaks on its data center equipment. Not to be outdone, Virginia passed laws in 2009 and 2010 that exempted sales taxes on things like data center computer servers, software, power generators and chillers to cool all that equipment.\u201cWe\u2019ve had six years of construction work,\u201d said Mr. Carter. That has helped the county, he said, because even temporary workers rent houses, stay in hotels and eat in local restaurants.Microsoft did not dispute reports that it would spend $1.1 billion on the Boydton data center, and said that \u201con average, data centers employ tens to several dozen people,\u201d in a mixture of corporate and contracted positions. It declined to let a reporter tour the site.\u201cThey talked about 100 jobs, but it\u2019s a slow process,\u201d said Thomas C. Coleman III, the mayor of Boydton. So far, he says, the biggest impact \u201chas been a couple of lunch tables at the Triangle gas station.\u201dHe understates matters, but not by much. Mr. Gregory, the electrician, said his union had hundreds of applicants for work digging ditches and laying pipe, starting at $10.88 an hour. Wiring paid $28.59. Both jobs tended to last about six months, he said, with lots of attrition for the hard outdoor labor.Working as a security guard or as someone testing the wires inside the data center offers better money, but there are not many positions. Microsoft prefers to fly in its own specialists for some work, and it doesn\u2019t like hiring people who have worked in other big companies\u2019 cloud-computing centers, Mr. Gregory said. (Microsoft said it did not exclude candidates based on previous experience.)\u201cWe can provide a place to live, but all those contractors will move on to the next town where they\u2019re building,\u201d Mr. Coleman said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you can count on.\u201dThe big cloud networks are immensely profitable for the few companies who can operate these global systems. The biggest three cloud companies estimate that the global market in business computing is worth $1 trillion or more, and they are rushing to expand globally. In interviews, all said they spend more than $2 billion annually on this.\u201cIt\u2019s phenomenal how rapidly they are growing,\u201d said Erik Brynjolfsson, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has written extensively on the impact of new technologies. \u201cIt is the key enabler of all kinds of technology advances, starting with the things companies do now, but lots cheaper, including outsourcing tech jobs.\u201dThat is hard to imagine in places where local roots go so deep. Conversations here usually start with people explaining where they are from, and what their families did here for generations. \u201cBoydton is the quintessential quaint courthouse town,\u201d said Leigh Lambert, the town librarian. \u201cPeople from here love it. It feels like it\u2019s always with you.\u201dMs. Lambert grew up nearby, tried New York, and returned to work next to the court, which is adorned with a statue of a Confederate soldier. Microsoft initially came to a couple of town meetings, and it seemed to offer a way Boydton could come back. \u201cNow they\u2019re off by themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cWe hear they have a really nice Starbucks machine.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Think Amazon\u2019s Drone Delivery Idea Is a Gimmick? Think Again", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtAmazon is the most obscure large company in the tech industry.It isn\u2019t just secretive, the way Apple is, but in a deeper sense, Jeff Bezos\u2019 e-commerce and cloud-storage giant is opaque. Amazon rarely explains either its near-term tactical aims or its long-term strategic vision. It values surprise.To understand Amazon, then, is necessarily to engage in a kind of Kremlinology. That\u2019s especially true of the story behind one of its most important business areas: the logistics by which it ships orders to its customers.So what\u2019s Amazon\u2019s ultimate aim in delivery? After talking to analysts, partners and competitors, and prying some very minimal input from Amazon itself, I suspect the company has a two-tiered vision for the future of shipping.First, it\u2019s not trying to replace third-party shippers. Instead, over the next few years, Amazon wants to add as much capacity to its operations as possible, and rather than replace partners like UPS and FedEx, it is spending boatloads on planes, trucks, crowdsourcing and other novel delivery services to add to its overall capacity and efficiency.Amazon\u2019s longer-term goal is more fantastical \u2014 and, if it succeeds, potentially transformative. It wants to escape the messy vicissitudes of roads and humans. It wants to go fully autonomous, up in the sky. The company\u2019s drone program, which many in the tech press dismissed as a marketing gimmick when Mr. Bezos unveiled it on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in 2013, is central to this future; drones could be combined with warehouses manned by robots and trucks that drive themselves to unlock a new autonomous future for Amazon.If Amazon\u2019s drone program succeeds (and Amazon says it is well on track), it could fundamentally alter the company\u2019s cost structure. A decade from now, drones would reduce the unit cost of each Amazon delivery by about half, analysts at Deutsche Bank projected in a recent research report. If that happens, the economic threat to competitors would be punishing \u2014 \u201cretail stores would cease to exist,\u201d Deutsche\u2019s analysts suggested, and we would live in a world more like that of \u201cThe Jetsons\u201d than our own.Shipping has always been at the core of Amazon\u2019s strategic investments. In its earliest days, as part of an effort to avoid collecting sales tax from most customers, Amazon purposefully placed warehouses in low-tax, low-population states, and then shipped goods to populous areas within three to five days.As consumer and commercial drones increase in popularity, the government is taking more steps to address safety concerns and regulate the aerial vehicles.The 2005 introduction of Amazon\u2019s Prime subscription program, which gives customers two-day delivery on many goods for an annual price of $99, changed Amazon\u2019s shipping needs. Prime encouraged customers to buy a lot more stuff, and it also forced Amazon to deliver packages more quickly.For Amazon, that projected future is catastrophic: Pretty much all of Amazon\u2019s current investments in shipping \u2014 in trucks, planes and crowdsourced delivery cars \u2014 depend on the traditional shipping infrastructure.All, that is, except for drones \u2014 which explains why they are integral to Amazon\u2019s vision of the future of retail.When I began talking to others in the drone industry about Amazon\u2019s interest in autonomous flight, they all pointed out that drones offer a way to leapfrog roads. Because they operate in a new, untrammeled layer of physical space \u2014 below 400 feet, an airspace that is currently unoccupied in most of the country \u2014 they open up a vast new shipping lane.Scenes like that are most likely in the far-off future. But according to Amazon, the earliest incarnation of drone deliveries will happen much sooner \u2014 we will see it within five years, somewhere in the world.Email: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Women\u2019s Soccer Team Has Changed, but Hunt for Gold Has Not", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnalysisRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Scroll back to 2011 for a minute. In the quarterfinals of the Women\u2019s World Cup, with the United States down a goal and a player in the final seconds of overtime, Megan Rapinoe curled a 45-yard crossing pass onto the forehead of Abby Wambach, who smashed it into the net for a 2-2 tie in a game that the Americans won on penalty kicks.The degree of difficulty alone made it one of the great goals in United States soccer history \u2014 think of sinking a 50-foot putt on the 18th green to win the United States Open \u2014 and it propelled Rapinoe and Wambach, and their teammates, to the final, where they had a 2-1 lead late in overtime against Japan but could not protect it as Japan won on penalty kicks.Check out 2012 for a second. At the Summer Olympics in London, the same group of American women fought off a huge upset bid by Canada in the semifinals, finally prevailing, 4-3, when Alex Morgan headed in the winning goal, again in the final seconds of overtime. This time the United States held onto a 2-1 lead against Japan in the finals, only because Hope Solo made a great body-extension save in the final minutes of regulation to prevent a tying goal.Finally, there is 2015, and the Women\u2019s World Cup in Canada. In a semifinal game against Germany, with the score 0-0 in the second half, Solo psyched out Celia Susic on a penalty kick to keep the game scoreless and the United States from falling into a dangerous hole. The Americans took over the game and won, 2-0. In the final, again against Japan, Carli Lloyd led an early onslaught \u2014 four goals in the first 16 minutes \u2014 that gave the United States a 5-2 victory, a World Cup title and a ticker-tape parade in Manhattan that affirmed the team\u2019s soaring status and appeal.Now the American women, with some inevitable additions to and subtractions from the roster and a continuing wage dispute with the national soccer federation, are back at it again. In one of the initial events of the Rio Olympics, the Americans will face New Zealand in a first-round game in Belo Horizonte on Wednesday night, 48 hours before the opening ceremony.There are 12 women\u2019s teams in the Olympic competition, and two-thirds of them will advance to the quarterfinals, in contrast to the format of last year\u2019s World Cup, which had 24 teams and an elimination round that began with 16 teams, rather than eight.Still, the Olympics count for a lot. If the United States wins this tournament, it will represent the first time in women\u2019s soccer that the same country has won the World Cup and the Olympics in consecutive years. It will also give the American women four straight Olympic gold medals.Most significant, perhaps, it will add to the notion that the women are America\u2019s most compelling national team. The roster includes several familiar faces \u2014 Rapinoe, Morgan, Lloyd, Solo, Julie Johnston, Becky Sauerbrunn, Meghan Klingenberg, Morgan Brien, Tobin Heath, Kelley O\u2019Hara and Ali Krieger \u2014 and some significant new ones.Most notable in that group are Crystal Dunn, 24, who nearly made the World Cup roster last year and has now emerged as a dynamic scorer, and the U.C.L.A.-bound Mallory Pugh, who at 18 is the youngest player on the team and is, like Dunn, an offensive threat.Gone from the team, and into retirement, are some stalwarts: Wambach, Christie Rampone, Shannon Boxx and Lauren Holiday.And on the bubble, perhaps, is Rapinoe, 32, who is still probably the most creative and colorful player on the team \u2014 provided she is healthy. She injured her right knee in December, having twice hurt her left knee in college, and did not take part in any of the tuneup games leading to the Olympics.Whether she can participate in group play remains to be seen. In addition to New Zealand, the United States is in a group with France, a tough team that the Americans were able to avoid in last year\u2019s World Cup, and Colombia, which the Americans did meet in the World Cup and beat, 2-0.But at some point, Rapinoe is likely to be called on \u2014 just not in a final against Japan. Somehow, that nation failed to qualify for the tournament despite its sustained run of success in recent years.The American women, in contrast, always show up. Their group schedule includes a game in Manaus, in the Amazon, on Aug. 9. And their track record suggests a date in the final in Rio on Aug. 19, opponent to be named.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China, Not Silicon Valley, Is Cutting Edge in Mobile Tech", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAll of these developments have something in common: The technology was first popularized in China.Silicon Valley has long been the world\u2019s tech capital: It birthed social networking and iPhones and spread those tech products across the globe. The rap on China has been that it always followed in the Valley\u2019s footsteps as government censorship abetted the rise of local versions of Google, YouTube and Twitter.But China\u2019s tech industry \u2014 particularly its mobile businesses \u2014 has in some ways pulled ahead of the United States. Some Western tech companies, even the behemoths, are turning to Chinese firms for ideas.\u201cWe just see China as further ahead,\u201d said Ted Livingston, the founder of Kik, which is headquartered in Waterloo, Ontario.The shift suggests that China could have a greater say in the global tech industry\u2019s direction. Already in China, more people use their mobile devices to pay their bills, order services, watch videos and find dates than anywhere else in the world. Mobile payments in the country last year surpassed those in the United States. By some estimates, loans from a new breed of informal online banks called peer-to-peer lenders did too.The future of online payments and engagements can be found at Liu Zheng\u2019s noodle shop in central Beijing. Liu Xiu\u2019e, 60, and her neighbor, Zhang Lixin, 55, read about the noodle shop on WeChat. Then they ordered and paid for their lunches and took and posted selfies of themselves outside the restaurant, all using the same app.Liu Zheng, who is not related to Liu Xiu\u2019e, said the automated ordering and payments meant he could cut down on wages for waiters. \u201cIn the future, we will only need one waiter to help in the restaurant and one to help with seating,\u201d Mr. Liu said.Before Venmo became the app for millennials to transfer money in the United States, both young and old in China were investing, reimbursing each other, paying bills,and buying products from stores with smartphone-based digital wallets.\u201cQuite frankly, the trope that China copies the U.S. hasn\u2019t been true for years, and in mobile it\u2019s the opposite: The U.S. often copies China,\u201d said Ben Thompson, the founder of the tech research firm Stratechery. \u201cFor the Facebook Messenger app, for example, the best way to understand their road map is to look at WeChat.\u201dA Facebook spokesman declined to comment. Tencent did not respond to requests for comment.Executives from companies like Facebook and smaller rivals like Kik are trying to replicate what has emerged in China: dominant online platforms where users will spend much of their time. Much of that effort is focused on chat.\u201cThe cool thing about chat is it becomes an operating system for your daily life,\u201d Mr. Livingston said. \u201cGoing up to a vending machine, ordering food, getting a cab: Chat can power those interactions, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing with WeChat.\u201dThe biggest advantage for China\u2019s tech industry, according to many analysts, is that it was able to fill a vacuum after the country essentially created much of its economy from scratch following the end of the Cultural Revolution, in 1976. Unlike in the United States, where banks and retailers already have strong holds on customers, China\u2019s state-run lenders are inefficient, and retailers never expanded broadly enough to serve a fast-growing middle class.Many Chinese also never bought a personal computer, meaning smartphones are the primary \u2014 and often first \u2014 computing device for the more than 600 million who have them in China.\u201cThe U.S. was first to credit cards, and everyone there has a personal computer. But China, where everyone is on their phones all the time, is now ahead in mobile commerce and mobile payments by virtue of leapfrogging the PC and credit cards,\u201d Mr. Thompson said.Chinese companies also approach the internet in a different way. In the United States, tech firms emphasize simplicity in their apps. But in China, its three major internet companies \u2014 Alibaba, Baidu and the WeChat parent Tencent \u2014 compete to create a single app with as many functions as they can stuff into it.On Alibaba\u2019s Taobao shopping app, people can also buy groceries, buy credits for online games, scan coupons and find deals at stores nearby. Baidu\u2019s mapping app lets users order an Uber, reserve a restaurant or hotel, order in food, buy movie tickets and find just about any type of store nearby.Tencent has opened up WeChat to other companies, allowing them to create apps within WeChat. Ebaoyang \u2014 a start-up that enables people to order oil changes for their cars directly on smartphones \u2014 was at first almost totally reliant on WeChat to attract business. Gao Feng, one of Ebaoyang\u2019s founders, said the company still relied on the app for 50 percent of its payments and 20 percent of new customers.\u201cWe started from WeChat. So it was our main, original source for getting customers,\u201d he said.Between fees for its services and money it makes through online games, WeChat manages to generate $7 in revenue per user each year, according to Nomura. The app has roughly 700 million users, more than the total number of smartphone users in China, in part because some users are outside the country and in part because people have multiple accounts.Much of that comes not from ads, as it might in the United States, but from spending on games, services and goods sold on the app. Those models may not translate from one market to the other, but the two can still borrow from each other, said Carmen Chang, a partner at the venture capital firm New Enterprise Associates.\u201cChina was able to develop a lot of innovative business models, which arose in a different kind of economy,\u201d said Ms. Chang, who spends time in both China and in Menlo Park, Calif. \u201cWhether or not we admit it here in Silicon Valley, it\u2019s had an impact on us and our thinking.\u201dCao Li in Beijing contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Viacom, Now Comes the Hard Part", "Date": "2016-08-19", "News": "Supported byIn the summer of 1987, Sumner M. Redstone wrested control of Viacom in a hostile corporate takeover that left scorched relationships with the company\u2019s management. Still bitter, executives sent Thomas E. Dooley, Viacom\u2019s 30-year-old treasurer, to greet Mr. Redstone when he visited the Viacom office, the new boss wearing a plaid jacket bought on his way, the Filene\u2019s Basement price tag still visible.On Friday, Viacom elevated Mr. Dooley to interim chief executive from chief operating officer. He was appointed as Viacom announced that the embattled Philippe P. Dauman had stepped down as chief executive, with a severance package valued at about $72 million. (Since being named chief executive of Viacom in 2006, Mr. Dauman\u2019s total reported compensation was $409.7 million even as the company has struggled in recent years.)With a truce declared in the battle for control of the 93-year-old Mr. Redstone\u2019s companies, a harsh spotlight now is focused on Viacom\u2019s struggling business. The company, which owns the MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon cable television networks and the Paramount Pictures film and television studio, has had a nearly 50 percent plunge in its share price in the last two years.This was the company that ignited the careers of Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, brought to life characters like SpongeBob SquarePants and Dora the Explorer and had generations demanding the music videos of MTV.But in recent years, the company has been overshadowed by popular digital outlets like Netflix, Amazon and Snapchat and plagued by weak ratings and declines in advertising sales across several of its TV networks. At the same time, its film studio has delivered dismal results. \u201cBen Hur,\u201d Paramount\u2019s production with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, is expected to be yet another box-office disappointment.The resolution to the legal dispute left investors and analysts with a list of questions about the fate of Viacom: Would the company pursue a sale of Paramount? Will the Redstones push to reunite Viacom with CBS after the two companies split a decade ago? Will the genial Mr. Dooley, who is interim chief executive through Sept. 30, take on the chief executive title permanently?\u201cYou and I are buying a house together, and it is called a fixer-upper, darling,\u201d Mario Gabelli, whose investment firm, Gamco, is the second-largest voting shareholder in Viacom and CBS, said in an interview when discussing the state of the company.\u201cThe main question is, what is Shari going to do?\u201d added Mr. Gabelli, who said that he had met with Ms. Redstone twice in the last 12 months.The settlement, which Viacom\u2019s board approved Thursday night, firmly put the fate of the company under the control of Mr. Redstone, who is in failing health, and his daughter. The board of National Amusements, the private theater chain company through which Mr. Redstone controls about 80 percent of the voting shares in Viacom and CBS, met later and approved the deal.\u201cThe agreement serves the best interests of Viacom, its shareholders, and you, our employees, and it paves the way for our future,\u201d Mr. Dooley said in a memo to the Viacom staff on Friday. \u201cI know we all share a desire to guide the company through this transition in the best possible way.\u201dThe settlement makes way for Viacom\u2019s board to expand to include the five new directors that National Amusements put forward in June. They include Nicole Seligman, a former Sony executive and lawyer who represented President Bill Clinton during his impeachment trial; and Kenneth Lerer, a venture capitalist, a co-founder of The Huffington Post and chairman of BuzzFeed.Mr. Dooley, who started at Viacom in 1980, is expected to work closely with the new board during the next month and a half to develop a new plan for the struggling company. He is said to want the top job but also is committed to working with the new board through a transition period on whatever outcome is best for the company.Mr. Dooley, a longstanding partner to Mr. Dauman who helped create much of the company\u2019s strategy in the last several years, has much to prove. In his memo to staff, Mr. Dooley wrote more than 200 words about his close friendship with Mr. Dauman, recognizing and thanking the ousted chief executive.War has spread across the empire of Sumner Redstone, one of the entertainment industry\u2019s most tenacious titans. At stake are the fortunes of his family and confidants, as well as the fate of Viacom and CBS.\u201cHe is a solid guy, with institutional knowledge, but is he a creative guy?\u201d Mr. Gabelli said of Mr. Dooley. \u201cHe is a compromised guy.\u201dMr. Dooley and Viacom\u2019s new board are expected to try to figure out how to reinvigorate the company and change the perception of its current businesses, without the overhang of the public power struggle that impeded business. That includes evaluating programming across the TV networks, new digital distribution methods, the international business and Paramount.Other options include exploring strategic partnerships, asset sales and other merger and acquisition activity.Some investors and analysts have pushed for Viacom and CBS to combine. Michael Nathanson, an analyst with MoffettNathanson Research, said such a deal would cut costs for executive salaries and put \u201ca real programmer in charge of the business,\u201d a reference to Leslie Moonves, CBS\u2019s well-respected chief executive.Yet other analysts said such a deal was unlikely, as the boards of both companies must act in the best interests of all of their shareholders.In addition, the settlement states that Mr. Dauman will stay on as nonexecutive chairman of Viacom until Sept. 13. He will have the opportunity to present his proposal to sell a 49 percent stake in Paramount to the Viacom board. Yet that transaction would require the unanimous approval of the Viacom board and is unlikely to receive the green light.Advertisement"}

It had belonged to a friend of his grandfather\u2019s. Mr. Madere said he was forgiven.But these are still the early days of drone racing, mostly a sport of part-timers. Mr. Madere, for example, works in a graphic design shop. Another pilot here, Steve Zoumas, 31, works in his family\u2019s contracting firm on Long Island.It is also a sport for do-it-yourselfers, tinkerers and improvisers. Some drone pilots start a day of flying with six or seven drones and go home with only one or two still working. Sometimes the onboard battery fails and the drone does not respond to joystick commands from the remote-control module. And sometimes the drone is nowhere to be found.That race lasted about 25 hours 9 minutes longer than each drone race here.So drone racing is about the thrill of speed, like hot-rodding?\u201cHundred percent,\u201d said Mr. Zoumas, who has a way of saying \u201chundred percent\u201d when he means \u201cyes.\u201dWhat about the high-pitched whistling noise that a drone makes when it is going that fast?

The drone he was flying had four small purple props.)So if he hears a change in sound, something is not right?\u201cHundred percent,\u201d he said.Some drone pilots say their sport has been scapegoated and that drones pose little danger if they are flown by pilots who know what they are doing. \u201cThe thing that separates it from other sports is there\u2019s less of a risk,\u201d Mr. Madere said. \u201cYou get to put yourself in a high-intensity situation without the risk of hurting yourself.\u201dEven before the first race, Mr. Madere had heard about the gate on the side of the science center building that his drone would have to dive through. This prompted the obvious question: Had he leapt tall buildings in a single bound?\u201cThe F.A.A. doesn\u2019t want me to answer that question,\u201d he said, although he acknowledged that what he meant was that he did not want the Federal Aviation Administration to read his answer, which was: once.And then, faster than you could say: \u201cIt\u2019s a bird!

{"Headline": "As Games End, Rio Celebrates While Looking Warily to Future", "Date": "2016-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The skies opened on Sunday night over Maracan\u00e3, the stadium where Brazil bade farewell to the Rio Olympics with a spectacle celebrating everything from the giants of Brazilian music to the rock art drawn by tribesmen thousands of years ago, as if the heavens were lamenting the end of the 17-day sports extravaganza.Nodding to Brazil\u2019s diversity as Latin America\u2019s largest country, the ceremony also honored facets of an astonishingly rich musical heritage that are often overlooked, promoting As Ganhadeiras de Itapu\u00e3, a group of former washerwomen rescuing Afro-Brazilian songs in northeast Brazil, as well as Arnaldo Antunes, a poet and vocalist who once sang for Tit\u00e3s, a pioneering S\u00e3o Paulo rock band.Despite widespread fears that the city would be unprepared, or that crime and disorganization might turn the Olympics into a national embarrassment, many Brazilians came to view the Games as a triumph and a much-needed distraction from the country\u2019s economic malaise and political upheaval.In the days after the opening ceremony, the criticisms that the Games were an inappropriate use of public money at a time of crisis were mostly subsumed by a sense that Brazil had largely met the logistical challenges, delivering the world\u2019s biggest sporting event for the half-million visitors who flocked to Rio for South America\u2019s first Olympics.\u201cWe know the city isn\u2019t an easy place to live in, but Rio flung its arms wide open, and we need to congratulate ourselves for our receptiveness and joy in making such a beautiful party,\u201d said Naid\u00ea Gouv\u00eaa Lira, 45, a logistics analyst.The ebullience was further buoyed on Saturday by the Brazilian soccer team\u2019s win over Germany, a victory that yielded one of the country\u2019s seven gold medals in the Games and helped ease the sting of its humiliating 2014 World Cup loss to the Germans.14 PhotosOver all, Brazilians seemed satisfied with their relatively modest medal count, which placed the country among the top 14 nations, its best Olympic showing ever. Many are still savoring their first gold of the Rio Games, won in judo by Rafaela Silva, 24, a black woman from an impoverished part of Rio.\u201cTo see her win really lifted our spirits,\u201d said Fabio Costa dos Santos, 47, an unemployed carpenter who, like Silva, hails from City of God, a favela in the city\u2019s western suburbs.The Games were far from trouble free. Even after the authorities deployed an 85,000-strong security force to ease crime fears, Portugal\u2019s education minister was robbed at knifepoint. An Olympic bus carrying journalists was attacked by people throwing rocks.Outside the Olympic bubble, gun battles between the police and drug gangs in Complexo do Alem\u00e3o, a collection of favelas, the poor urban areas that emerged as squatter settlements, were a stubborn reminder of the untamed violence and yawning inequities in a city that officials had promised would be the world\u2019s safest during the Games.A police officer deployed to Rio for the Games was killed when the vehicle he was in came under fire in a favela controlled by drug gangs. The killing of the officer, H\u00e9lio Vieira Andrade, from Roraima State in the Brazilian Amazon, focused scrutiny on Rio\u2019s priorities during the Olympics.\u201cThere wasn\u2019t even a tear shed for him in the ocean that was the Olympics,\u201d Fernando Gabeira, a politician and writer, said, noting the contrast with emotions expressed around the victories and defeats of Brazil\u2019s athletes.Transportation gridlock frustrated visitors as they rushed between events on opposite sides of a sprawling metropolis. And many people complained about the glaring sight of empty seats, even at the closing ceremony, partly the result of unsold tickets that proved unaffordable to the working poor.The organizers seemed to stumble on several fronts, at least early on. Long security lines and shortages of food at some sites left spectators grumbling. A mysterious green tint in the diving and water polo pools was highly embarrassing.Here is a breakdown of all the medals awarded and the athletes who have competed at each Olympics, starting with the 1896 Games in Athens. The schedule for the Games in Rio de Janeiro and all the medal winners there are also listed.Still, 57 percent of Brazilians said that the Olympics had generated a more positive image of the country around the world, according to Ibope. The poll, conducted from Aug. 11 to 15 in interviews with 2,002 people, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus two percentage points.Those mixed feelings produced something of a paradox: a \u201cwasteful event that worked out,\u201d in the words of Jos\u00e9 Roberto de Toledo, a columnist for the newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo, who analyzed the poll.Still, many of the worst fears proved unfounded. Zika, the mosquito-borne virus that prompted some foreign athletes to stay home, was largely forgotten as the Games got underway.So, too, were anxieties over a potential terrorist attack. And while the state government failed to meet promises that it would clean up the sewage-infested Guanabara Bay, boating competitions took place without any collisions between sailors and floating sofas.Anderson Gurgel, a sports researcher at Mackenzie Presbyterian University in S\u00e3o Paulo, commended the organizers for dealing with the unexpected problems, although he said they were sometimes slow to act.\u201cEvery event of this size has problems; the issue is how to manage them,\u201d Gurgel said. \u201cBrazilians need to learn things won\u2019t always go wrong, that there won\u2019t always be chaos.\u201dStill, the closing ceremony exuded simplicity while lacking the over-the-top dazzle of other Olympic spectacles, creating a buoyant atmosphere inside Maracan\u00e3 by mixing performances by contemporary musicians like Lenine with homages for giants of Brazilian culture like the composer Luiz Gonzaga. Athletes paraded under the rain to the samba tunes.The Rio Games will also be remembered for a debacle that was not of its own making: the false claims by the American swimmer Ryan Lochte that he and some of his teammates had been pulled over and robbed at gunpoint by men describing themselves as police officers.On Saturday, Lochte tried to put the controversy to rest by admitting that he had exaggerated the details of the incident. \u201cI let my team down,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cI learned my lesson.\u201dStill, the victory of Brazil\u2019s national soccer team over Germany\u2019s allowed many in the country to pivot from the episode involving the swimmers. Globo, Brazil\u2019s dominant television network, luxuriated in the conquest of the soccer gold medal, devoting the bulk of its nightly news program to the triumph.But even amid the celebrations, the rising polarization of Brazil\u2019s unruly if functioning democracy was on display.Indeed, the sense of reverie will be tested in the coming weeks as Brazilians confront the ugly realities of surging unemployment, rampant corruption and the intensifying political drama in the capital, Bras\u00edlia.The respite will be brief: In the coming days, Brazil\u2019s Senate will start its trial of Ms. Rousseff on charges that she illegally manipulated the federal budget. Michel Temer, the interim president, did not event attend the closing spectacle after he was greeted with a chorus of boos during the opening ceremony.For Rio residents, the intoxicating mood of the past two weeks will inevitably give way to an array of challenges: the inadequate sewage-treatment system, the growing poverty and a broken state government unable to pay thousands of civil servants on time. Rio\u2019s mayor, Eduardo Paes, who hitched his political fortunes to the organization of the Games, was booed when he appeared on stage Sunday night, a reception that stood in contrast to the applause for Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who appeared to mark the transition to the next Summer Olympics in Tokyo in 2020.Most worrisome, many say, is what happens after the tens of thousands of soldiers and military police personnel who were dispatched to Rio for the Games go back to their home states. A last-minute cash infusion from the federal government helped finance the surge in security, but a police union official has warned of strikes should the city\u2019s police force go unpaid.Elizabeth Rezende, 61, a retired maid, said she was bracing for a return of the status quo. \u201cSure, the Games have been a good thing for Rio, but once they are over, poor people like us will be back in hell,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be locked in our homes while the criminals roam the streets with impunity.\u201dPaula Moura and Anna Jean Kaiser contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Power of Memories: \u2018Muriel\u2019 and \u2018Cemetery of Splendor\u2019", "Date": "2016-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn DVDTime and memory were consistent concerns for the French director Alain Resnais, who died in 2014 at 91. Historical trauma was a preoccupation as well, at least during the first stage of Mr. Resnais\u2019s long career.For these reasons, among others, \u201cMuriel, or The Time of Return\u201d (1963) can be considered his quintessential film. As revisited in Criterion\u2019s excellent new Blu-ray transfer, made from a 2015 digital restoration, it also appears to be his greatest.As compared with \u201cMarienbad,\u201d \u201cMuriel\u201d tells a relatively straightforward story. (The script was by Jean Cayrol, the concentration camp survivor who wrote the narration for Mr. Resnais\u2019s classic documentary \u201cNight and Fog.\u201d) It\u2019s the way in which the plot unfolds that is radically unconventional. The action is chronological but fragmentary, filled with parallels and mysteries.\u201cMuriel\u201d is set in Boulogne-sur-Mer, a town on the French side of the English Channel largely destroyed by Allied bombs during World War II and subsequently rebuilt. The protagonist, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne (Delphine Seyrig), is a widowed antique dealer and unlucky gambler whose world is further rocked when her prewar lover, Alphonse (Jean-Pierre K\u00e9rien), returns to court her, despite having a young mistress in tow.Meanwhile, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s stepson, Bernard (Jean-Baptiste Thi\u00e9rr\u00e9e), is coping with the aftermath of the recent colonial war in Algeria, where he served as a soldier. High-strung and reclusive, he speaks of a nonexistent girlfriend, Muriel, who manifests the guilty memory of a wartime atrocity in which he participated.H\u00e9l\u00e8ne lives in a reconstructed town, surrounded by old objects she sells for a living. Alphonse keeps bringing up, and most likely fictionalizing, their distant personal history, while Bernard alternately denies and attempts to document his. \u201cI\u2019m collecting evidence,\u201d he explains more than once. \u201cMuriel\u201d is all about all the ways that the past makes itself present.\u201cMuriel\u201d is also about representing life as a movie. The aggressively atonal soundtrack by the German composer Hans Werner Henze calls attention to the film as a construct. So do Mr. Resnais\u2019s percussive camera moves and dense editing.The screenplay supplies the exits and entrances of a stage play. But the largely associative montage is highly cinematic and overtly modernist, based less on the characters\u2019 histrionics than a sense of clashing vectors and visual force fields. At times, Mr. Resnais intercuts multiple conversations or matches the sound of one interaction to the image of another so that the movie seems to be talking to itself.Around the time that one character angrily asks, \u201cCan\u2019t we be done with the past?,\u201d Mr. Resnais decides the clear the stage. The movie becomes almost antic and then powerfully abrupt as the principals begin to disappear.In essence, \u201cMuriel\u201d is a series of ruptures \u2014 both for Mr. Resnais\u2019s characters and within his film \u2014 that serve to dramatize the way in which war and colonialism can disrupt individual lives as well as conventional narratives.His distinctive, highly personal movies, which can appear deliberately na\u00efve and are characterized by what seems to be a Buddhist-inflected animism, can be even more mysterious than those of Mr. Resnais\u2019s.\u201cCemetery of Splendor\u201d (out on Blu-ray and DVD from Strand Releasing) may be Mr. Weerasethakul\u2019s most political movie, set in a bucolic hospital for narcoleptic soldiers in Khon Kaen, the filmmaker\u2019s hometown, in northeast Thailand. A former school, the hospital was built atop an ancient ruin and perhaps serves as cover for a secret government project.The three main characters are the young soldier Itt; a middle-aged hospital volunteer, Jen (Jenjira Pongpas Widner, a frequent presence in Mr. Weerasethakul\u2019s movies), who sits with Itt while he sleeps and keeps him company during his brief, unpredictable periods of wakefulness; and a younger woman, Keng, the hospital\u2019s resident medium, who can \u201csee\u201d the sleeping soldiers\u2019 dreams.Frequent close-ups of spinning ceiling fans promote a hypnotic mood. At one point, an overhead shot of a movie theater\u2019s overlapping escalators provides a pattern that suggests a \u201cfound\u201d mandala. Intimations of perpetual civil war notwithstanding, Mr. Weerasethakul\u2019s criticism is oblique, as befits a movie made under martial law. Beside each sleeping soldier is an upright neon tube reminiscent of a Dan Flavin sculpture, described as a machine initially developed to promote \u201cgood dreams\u201d for American soldiers in Afghanistan.Given the many local references, the \u201cSplendor\u201d disc could have benefited from notes, like the fine essay by James Quandt accompanying \u201cMuriel.\u201d It does, however, include as an extra Mr. Weerasethakul\u2019s short feature \u201cMekong Hotel,\u201d a gentle ghost story \u2014 possibly the ghost of an unfinished project \u2014 made in 2012.NEWLY RELEASEDAdvertisement"}

In recent years, the company has been battered by Amazon\u2019s rise as a leading bookseller and crippled by losses from its Nook e-reader division. Its fleet of retail stores has shrunk to 640 from 720 in the last six years.Mr. Boire, who previously worked in top posts at Sears Canada, Brookstone and Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, tried to transform Barnes & Noble by expanding its selection of games, toys, art supplies and music and by offering coding and 3D printing workshops. On corporate earnings calls, Mr. Boire often talked about how strong sales of coloring books and vinyl records were bolstering revenue.\u201cEverything we do around learning, personal growth and development fits with our brand,\u201d he said in an interview with The New York Times in December.There were some encouraging signs of stability. The company announced plans to open four new retail stores in the 2017 fiscal year.But the chain has still struggled to recover from its heavy investments in its Nook e-reader, a device that was meant to give it a foothold in the digital marketplace but ended up hemorrhaging money instead. Mr. Boire\u2019s attempts to turn the company\u2019s fortunes around have largely fallen short. In an earnings report for the final quarter of the current fiscal year, Barnes & Noble reported a loss of $30.6 million, or 42 cents a share, compared to losses of $19.4 million, or 37 cents a share, in the same period the previous year. Revenue dropped 3.7 percent to $876.7 million during the period, while Nook sales tumbled 20 percent.Perhaps most troubling, Barnes & Noble\u2019s troubles have persisted even as many other physical book retailers, particularly independent bookstores, have flourished. Sales of books in physical stores grew 1.8 percent, to $4.15 billion, in 2015 compared to 2014, according to the Association of American Publishers. Print book sales have rebounded as well: revenues from hardcover books rose by 8.3 percent last year, while e-book unit sales fell by 9.7 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On DVD, an American in Paris (and in the Soviet Union)", "Date": "2016-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn DVDAmerican insouciance melts Russian sanctimony in Arthur Freed\u2019s 1957 production \u201cSilk Stockings,\u201d the jauntiest of Cold War movies.Adapted from Cole Porter\u2019s Broadway musical of the same name, itself based on Ernst Lubitsch\u2019s \u201cNinotchka\u201d (1939), \u201cSilk Stockings\u201d (now on Blu-ray from Warner Archive) is a contest between rival utopian ideologies \u2014 Soviet communism and Hollywood make-believe. \u201cThe Iron Curtain dissolved by music,\u201d exults the film\u2019s protagonist, an American movie producer in Paris played by Fred Astaire. \u201cWhat propaganda!\u201dThis shifty producer has finagled a famous Soviet composer into providing the score for his latest project. Consequently, Soviet authorities assign three commissars to repatriate the composer; when they succumb to the pleasures of Paris and delay their mission, the stern and beautiful Ninotchka (Cyd Charisse) is dispatched to bring them all back \u2014 unless, of course, Paris works its magic on her.Structurally, \u201cSilk Stockings\u201d is similar to \u201cFunny Face,\u201d another musical ode to Paris released earlier in 1957, wherein Mr. Astaire\u2019s glib fashion photographer successfully wooed Audrey Hepburn\u2019s diffident beatnik. But \u201cSilk Stockings\u201d is less seamless entertainment, in part because of its ambivalence regarding American show business.The movie starts with the rousing \u201cToo Bad We Can\u2019t Go Back to Moscow,\u201d an implicit paean to the melting pot by the three commissars \u2014 Joseph Buloff, Jules Munshin and Peter Lorre, each actor channeling a distinct theatrical tradition. (Mr. Buloff came out of Yiddish \u201cart\u201d theater; Mr. Munshin was schooled in the Catskills; and Mr. Lorre, advertised as making his \u201cfirst big comedy role,\u201d had achieved some fame acting with Bertolt Brecht in Berlin.) The number turns ecstatic when Mr. Astaire, then in his late 50s, joins with his own version of a cha-cha.Best remembered for his early sound films, including the musicals \u201cApplause\u201d and \u201cLove Me Tonight,\u201d the director Rouben Mamoulian (1898-1987) had a notable theatrical career, staging the original Broadway productions of \u201cPorgy and Bess,\u201d \u201cOklahoma!\u201d and \u201cCarousel,\u201d among others. His most canny strategy in directing the movie, which would be his swan song, was to treat \u201cSilk Stockings\u201d as a dance musical \u2014 and dance itself as a form of liberation.\u201cSilk Stockings\u201d has been criticized for its reactionary politics, sexual and otherwise. But if Western consumption triumphs over Soviet ideals, and Ninotchka becomes \u201ca real woman,\u201d capitalist victory is not cost-free. Ninotchka\u2019s personhood is diminished, even as the composer\u2019s work is vulgarized. (Perhaps Mr. Astaire\u2019s is as well: His final number, \u201cThe Ritz Roll and Rock,\u201d is a misguided attempt to be \u201cwith it.\u201d)Upbeat as it is, \u201cSilk Stockings\u201d has an underlying melancholy. The fondness with which it sends up Russian culture is striking, perhaps more today than in 1957.Thirteen years before \u201cSilk Stockings,\u201d MGM envisioned another romantic alliance between a debonair American musical artist and a sober, if winsome, Soviet lass: \u201cSong of Russia\u201d (available on DVD from Warner Archive).Its star Robert Taylor, who told the House Un-American Activities Committee he\u2019d been coerced by the Office of War Information into making the movie, plays an American conductor. Touring the Soviet Union, he falls for a young music student (Susan Peters) who pounds out a Tchaikovsky piano concerto with as much brio as she drives a kolkhoz tractor. Their romance and marriage takes on historical significance once Nazi Germany invades the bride\u2019s native village.Michael Visaroff, a native of Moscow and veteran of 113 Hollywood films, plays Stalin (uncredited). The cast includes a number of other performers born in imperial Russia: Michael Chekhov (renowned teacher of the Stanislavsky method), Leo Bulgakov (director of an American-made Ukrainian-language film) and the Yiddish radio star Moishe Oysher, appearing under a pseudonym to sing \u201cAnd Russia Is Her Name.\u201d They are Ninotchka\u2019s cousins, if not her brethren.NEWLY RELEASEDAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Despite Sales, \u2018Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\u2019 Isn\u2019t Magical to Some Fans", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byScholastic had high expectations for \u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child,\u201d which arrived on July 31 with an enormous first printing of 4.5 million copies.The publisher\u2019s optimism was well warranted, it seems. The play has become an overnight blockbuster, selling more than two million hardcover copies in the first 48 hours, Scholastic said on Wednesday, calling the sales \u201cunprecedented for a script book.\u201dThe play, which is being billed as the eighth book in the Harry Potter series, is a continuation of the story, but also with a stark departure in style and form. It was written by the playwright Jack Thorne, with input from the creator of the series, J. K. Rowling, and the play\u2019s director, John Tiffany. The plot unfolds 19 years after the Battle of Hogwarts, when an adult Harry Potter, now a father and a civil servant working at the Ministry of Magic, sees his own children off to Hogwarts.The publication coincided with the opening of the play in London, which drew rapturous reviews from theater critics and fans.But the book, which arrives nearly a decade after Ms. Rowling officially ended the series, has already caused a minor schism among devoted Potterheads. While many readers were ecstatic about the chance to have more material on Harry and his friends, others have faulted Ms. Rowling for licensing out her story and characters. Some fans have lashed out online, saying they feel they were duped and misled by the prominence of Ms. Rowling\u2019s name on the cover.\u201cThis is NOT a Harry Potter book I frankly feel disgusted even adding it to the collection,\u201d one disappointed fan wrote on Amazon. \u201cIt reads like a poorly written fan fiction.\u201dFor Scholastic, the Harry Potter books have been a reliable cash cow, with more than 160 million copies sold in the United States and more than 450 million copies sold worldwide. In the fiscal quarter ending on May 31, Scholastic\u2019s children\u2019s trade sales rose 12 percent in the fourth quarter and 14 percent for the year overall, \u201clargely due to strength in core publishing, both frontlist and backlist, and its Harry Potter franchise,\u201d the company said.The sales of \u201cCursed Child\u201d are a testament to the longevity of the franchise, though they fell far short of the sales record set in 2007 by \u201cHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,\u201d the seventh book in the series. \u201cDeathly Hallows\u201d sold 8.3 million copies in the United States during its first 24 hours on sale.Some fans hoped that Ms. Rowling, who has moved on to publishing fiction for adults, might bring Harry out of retirement and write more novels. But Ms. Rowling quickly put an end to those hopes over the weekend.Advertisement"}

Cupping Has an Olympic Moment", "Date": "2016-08-08", "News": "The ancient healing method of cupping is being used by several Olympians in Rio de Janeiro. The technique is intended to stimulate blood flow.RIO DE JANEIRO \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Olympics trivia: What has 19 gold medals and a bunch of purple circles?If you watched a certain swimmer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Rio Games debut on Sunday night, when he propelled the United States 4\u00d7100-meter relay team to a gold medal, you know the answer: Michael Phelps.While it may look like Phelps and several other Olympians with those skin marks have been in a bar fight, the telltale dots actually are signs of \u00e2\u0080\u009ccupping,\u00e2\u0080\u009d an ancient Chinese healing practice that is experiencing an Olympic moment.\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause this particular recovery modality shows blemishes on his skin, he walks around and looks like a Dalmatian or a really bad tattoo sleeve,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Keenan Robinson, Phelps\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal trainer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just another recovery modality. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing really particularly special about it.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe suction typically lasts for only a few minutes, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enough time to cause the capillaries just beneath the surface to rupture, creating the circular, eye-catching bruises that have been so visible on Phelps as well as members of the United States men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gymnastics team. If the bruising effect looks oddly familiar, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the same thing that happens when someone sucks on your neck and leaves a hickey.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done it before meets, pretty much every meet I go to,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Phelps said on Monday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo I asked for a little cupping yesterday because I was sore and the trainer hit me pretty hard and left a couple of bruises.\u00e2\u0080\u009dPhysiologically, cupping is thought to draw blood to the affected area, reducing soreness and speeding healing of overworked muscles. Athletes who use it swear by it, saying it keeps them injury free and speeds recovery. Phelps, whose shoulders were dotted with the purple marks as he powered the relay team, featured a cupping treatment in a recent video for a sponsor. He also posted an Instagram photo showing himself stretched on a table as his Olympic swimming teammate Allison Schmitt placed several pressurized cups along the back of his thighs. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThanks for my cupping today!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a psychological component where Michael has been doing this to feel good for a long time, about two years,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Robinson said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnything you can do to get the body to feel good \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you have to use an educational assessment on it. You have to make sure that what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing is causing a physiological intent to recover.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not just going to throw a stick of butter on him,\u201d Robinson said, adding, \u201cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to make sure I have an educated approach to it.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhile there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no question that many athletes, coaches and trainers believe in the treatment, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not much science to determine whether cupping offers a real physiological benefit or whether the athletes simply are enjoying a placebo effect.Still, a placebo effect can be beneficial, and for athletes at the Olympic level any legal edge, however tenuous, may be worth a few eye-catching bruises.Even so, Dr. Kalichman said he believes the treatment has a real physiological effect as well. It may be that cupping, by causing local inflammation, triggers the immune system to produce cytokines, small proteins that enhance communication between cells and help to modulate the immune response.Last year, Swimming World magazine noted that some college programs had begun using cupping therapy as well as the former Olympian Natalie Coughlin, who has posted a number of photos of herself undergoing the treatment.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe know that science says it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t detrimental,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Robinson said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe know that science says it does in some cases help out. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re at least going to expose the athletes to it years out so they can at least get a routine into it.\u00e2\u0080\u009dTodd Schmitz, who coaches the Olympic swimmer Missy Franklin, said Franklin started using cupping when she joined the swim team at Cal-Berkeley. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would say cupping is very much along the lines of ice baths,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Schmitz said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSome people will tell you that ice baths have no purpose whatsoever. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of those things if you think it helps you, you leave it in your repertoire.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe American gymnast Alexander Naddour was sporting the purple dots during the men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s qualifying rounds on Saturday in Rio. He told USA Today that he bought a do-it-yourself cupping kit from Amazon. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been the secret that I have had through this year that keeps me healthy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Naddour told USA Today. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been better than any money I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve spent on anything else.\u00e2\u0080\u009dKevin Rindal, the chiropractor for the United States swim teams, is one of only four chiropractors Phelps trusts to work on him. Rindal said that the device they use can be found on Amazon for $30. He acknowledged that some practitioners might not use it effectively.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI had a patient come in and he had a headache and he had a huge cup on his forehead because he thought he could cup his forehead,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rindal said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo people do some ridiculous stuff.\u00e2\u0080\u009dYour health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "Letter of Recommendation: Safety Razors", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter of RecommendationThe first razor I can remember owning is one I received as a present for my 18th birthday. It came in the mail from Gillette. I don\u2019t know how the company knew, but I was happy to be in its database. The Fusion, with its novel five-blade design, had recently hit the market. I was thrilled, and I cycled back and forth through the cartridges until they were all hair-\u00adclogged and uselessly dull. When I found out the price of a Fusion blade-\u00adrefill box, I saw my whole life stretch in front of me.For years I got used to two sad sights: a set of overused Gillette cartridges in the bathroom cabinet and my scruffy face in the mirror. It wasn\u2019t just the cost that made me resent the Fusion. The razor\u2019s shining plastic felt nice when I was a teenager, but into my 20s it still looked like the kind of product that only a teenager would be proud to own. The handle has all the heft of a Happy Meal toy.Shaving cartridges are so beloved in business circles that the strategy has its own name: the \u201crazor and blades\u201d model. You give away something free, or below cost, in order to get consumers hooked on the refills. Keurig K-Cups and Swiffers, for example. Not only are they ripoffs, but they\u2019re also incredibly wasteful, both in terms of packaging and the marketing required to make us forget, for example, that mops exist. Other times, they\u2019re all but unavoidable, as with smartphones (with their expensive data plans) and printers (with their extortionate ink refills).Cartridge razors are the incorrect answer to a common eighth-grade algebra problem: the cost equation. These typically compare two imaginary products, one with a high upfront cost and a low variable cost, the other the opposite. Their lesson (beyond how to find where lines intersect on a graph) is that for a consumer it\u2019s usually better to pay now for an expensive handle, not forever-\u00adafter for expensive blades. So three years ago, I went online and spent $33 on a Merkur Safety Razor 23C.It wasn\u2019t meant to be this way. King Camp Gillette introduced his safety razor, with disposable double-\u00adedge blades, around the turn of the 20th century. But before he was an inventor, Gillette was a starry-\u00adeyed utopian socialist. In 1894, he published \u201cThe Human Drift,\u201d a book that, among other things, envisioned most of the population of North America living in a huge metropolis powered by Niagara Falls. Production would be fully centralized, making for the greatest efficiency, while all goods would be free to everyone. That\u2019s the only way Gillette saw to ensure that the benefits of technological development would be shared. \u201cNo system can ever be a perfect system, and free from incentive for crime,\u201d he wrote, employing a prescient metaphor, \u201cuntil money and all representative value of material is swept from the face of the earth.\u201d His blade was a model socialist innovation: Gillette replaced toilsome sharpening labor with the smallest, most easily produced part imaginable. The very existence of the Gillette Fusion is an insult to his memory.To maintain growth, today\u2019s Gillette has to keep coming up with gimmicks, even sometimes at the expense of the truth. In 2005, a Federal District Court found that some of the company\u2019s ad claims about its vibrating M3 Power razor \u2014 that \u201cmicropulses\u201d lift hair up and away from the skin, allowing for a closer shave \u2014 were \u201cliterally false.\u201d King Camp imagined a modern world where each innovation would yield more luxury and freedom for everyone. Instead, his name represents a company that sells us increasingly absurd instruments as though they\u2019re the exclusive option for personal grooming. Advertisers pulled off an incredible coup by convincing us that the manliest choice is one that shields us from sharp objects.I use my Merkur every morning, letting its hefty handle warm in the sink. And every day, I use a fresh Astra blade. It\u2019s the kind of efficient extravagance I think King Camp might appreciate. Gillette, the company, actually bought Astra \u2014 a Czech company \u2014 in 1996 in order to expand its business in Eastern Europe. Now Astra has been swallowed up by Procter & Gamble, which acquired Gillette in 2005. On shaving forums and Reddit, users discuss stockpiling thousands of double-\u00adedge blades in anticipation of P.&G.\u2019s eventual success and the triumph of capitalist waste. Until then, King Camp Gillette\u2019s dream holds on by the thinnest margin.Malcolm Harris is a freelance writer and a columnist at Pacific Standard.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Raiding an Illegal Gold-Mining Ring in Peru\u2019s Amazon Jungle? Easy. Getting There? Next to Impossible.", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "Supported byI braced myself when I realized the water was about to go over the top of my rubber boots. I had already spent hours working my way down a path in the Amazon jungle, traveling with Peruvian soldiers who were on a mission to close down illegal gold-mining operations.\u201cTake the step,\u201d I thought to myself. \u201cYou have no choice anyhow. You can\u2019t turn around now. And it can\u2019t get much worse.\u201dI was wrong. Soon, I was in swirling water up to my armpits, and I heard one of the soldiers ask whether I knew how to swim. It would take us another six hours to get out of there.None of this was part of my plan. My plan had been simple. Illegal gold miners were destroying Peru\u2019s Amazon jungle. The government was intent on shutting them down. I would go on a ride-along, swooping into the jungle in a helicopter filled with government agents whose mission was to surprise the miners, destroy their camps and put them out of business. By night fall, the helicopter would have me back to a semi-decent hotel, hot water and a good bed.I had pestered for months to get permission to see Peru\u2019s efforts to halt the army of illegal miners that was already turning patches of the Tambopata reserve, one of the most biologically diverse places on earth, into toxic wasteland.I wanted to see the fight up close, not just because such access is rare but because there is no substitute for being there. It offers an understanding that no amount of reading and talking with experts \u2014 or looking at detailed satellite photos \u2014 can make up for. It allows you to tell a story with a special kind of authority. Whatever the discomfort, it is usually worth the effort.And yet sometimes you have little insight into what\u2019s coming. The night before we were to go, photographer Tomas Munita and I got word that we would be traveling by road, mostly on motorbikes, and spending the night at a rangers outpost in a remote area along the Malinowski river.Still, I thought, I was traveling with soldiers. What could happen?Tomas and I went off to the local market to buy rubber boots and ponchos, choosing the thick expensive ones. I packed a change of clothes in a small gym bag that looked waterproof. Tomas suggested I pack everything inside in plastic bags, just in case \u2014 an idea that turned out to be brilliant.By 6 a.m., we were at the mouth of a trail. Only then did the rangers explain that they had just four working dirt bikes, and they intended to run a shuttle service for our group of about 12 people. Tomas (who had agreed to be my translator since I was not allowed to bring one) was hustled onto one of the bikes. I would not see him again for 11 hours. Those of us left behind were told to start walking. My group included a small band of armed soldiers and two young women less than half my age \u2014 one a ranger intern, the other their videographer.At first, there was plenty of chitchat, much of which I could not understand. But as the trail disappeared under water \u2014 and it became harder and harder to keep from slipping, tripping or falling into a hole \u2014 we moved in total silence. The loudest sound in the forest was the rain hitting leaves, hard.Gangs controlled the other \u201croads,\u201d and there was a possibility we would be ambushed even here, a factor that was in the back of my mind. But soon the conditions were so bad that an attack seemed a very remote possibility. I was more worried about broken legs, snakebites, parasites and other gross things.No one had a radio. Our cellphones didn\u2019t work. And it was clear that no bikes would be coming back to get us.I was in one of the most beautiful settings on earth. But that fact intruded on my thoughts only occasionally. We walked for nine and a half hours, mostly in water. The poncho turned out to be porous. The new boots, soaking wet, were heavy and began to kill my toes. I had expected heat. But the water was cold. I was shivering. As with every other time I have ended up in a dangerous situation while reporting, my mind went over and over where I had made the stupid mistake that had landed me in such a spot.Eventually, some of the rangers who had gone ahead on bikes waded back to help us out of there. Perhaps because I was old enough to be their mother, the soldiers and rangers seemed unsure of how to deal with me. But one finally offered me his hand. I wondered later whether he regretted it. I did not let go of him for at least two hours as he inched forward first, trying to guide me to solid footing.Over the next two days (yes, one night turned into two) I watched these young men work so hard to do their job right. Some showed a deep knowledge and love of the rain forest they were trying to protect. But it was a shock to see how poorly equipped and vastly outmanned they were.Most spoke not a word of English. But even so, as I slipped down the 15-foot muddy embankment to get into a motorized canoe or got my boots stuck in the quicksand-like beach along the river, one of them always seemed there to hold my hand.My Fitbit didn\u2019t survive the soaking. The clothes I wore and slept in were so stained with gooey muck that they would go straight into the garbage. I am in the process of losing one of my toe nails.But as we headed for a different path home, I knew I had gotten what I wanted for my story. Going up the river away from the miners, we were in a still-pristine area. There, at dawn, we spotted a jaguar in the water swimming from shore to shore. The men turned off the boat engine to watch as the animal climbed out on a pebbly stretch.Then they burst out laughing. Our jaguar was fat. In this area of the reserve, at least for now, all was well.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Race and the Olympic Games", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd now, think Rio.What will the story line of these Games be? To what extent will race be a part of that narrative?Q. The opening ceremony included an acknowledgment of slavery (as captured in the photo above). How would you interpret what was going on there?Rio was the epicenter of this trade, and even within Brazil there is a misconception about how it functioned; many people here still think Salvador in the northeast received far more slaves when that just wasn\u2019t the case.Rio was the economic heart of Brazil at that time and then it was the seat of the empire. It was this linchpin of just a really brutal period in the country\u2019s history. So I think it\u2019s contributing to greater awareness and more discussion about the origins of the country.Somewhat symbolically, the first gold medal winner for Brazil, Rafaela Silva, was also this incredibly gifted competitor in judo and she grew up very poor \u2014 she\u2019s Afro-Brazilian, and she grew up very poor in Cidade de Deus, the City of God, the huge favela where Fernando Meirelles, the director of the opening ceremony, made his film of the same name. And her victory really resonated with a lot of people in Brazil, including in the favela where she was raised.Because back in 2012 when she lost in London, many of Brazil\u2019s sort of more uglier aspects in the debate over race and ethnicity surfaced; she suffered this torrent of abuse on Twitter. One person even called her a monkey. It was really painful to see that tension exploded in that way. She responded to people who were attacking her; her family felt really wounded and insulted.Then when she won her medal, her mom remarked that it was just a real victory for her and her family after everything that had happened.So this tension is bubbling to the surface in different ways in the country in a really interesting fashion.On a related note, Brazil\u2019s indigenous peoples were also portrayed during the opening ceremony, with dances that were similar to what you\u2019d see in the Amazon.But at the same time, there was no mention of the incredible indignities and suffering that indigenous peoples have had to endure in Brazil over the last five centuries, including genocide.There are these stunning discoveries that have been made about how complex societies were across Brazil before the European conquest and little was really made of that, so indigenous leaders are calling attention to that omission and questioning why they\u2019re being left out.Q. Do we know how much of a role the government played in shaping that message?There is a long tradition of this in Brazil going back at least to when the U.S. was segregated, of course, but Brazil was not.At the same time, it\u2019s still clear that racism persists in many ways. This is a country that is majority black and mixed race, according to the latest census figures, and yet if you walked into any corporate board room, or now into the ministry for Brazil\u2019s interim president, you\u2019re not going to find any Afro-Brazilians there. It\u2019s very rare to have Afro-Brazilians in positions of power in the country. It\u2019s just this incredible disconnect.Q. The Olympics seem to reflect that as well; there\u2019s been a fair amount of commentary about the fact that the people working the Games, say selling concessions, tend to be Afro-Brazilians, while those in the stands tend to be white. Are the Olympics bringing Brazilians together or reminding them of that divide? A lot of people were very excited when Rafaela won the medal. Her image was on the front pages of all of Brazil\u2019s major newspapers. Her postvictory interview was so moving; it was impossible not to be touched by that if you\u2019re Brazilian or if you have some connection to Brazil.I certainly felt incredibly moved.But there\u2019s also the realization: This is only two weeks out of the year in Brazil; many things will go back to normal once the Games are finished. This could just be a temporary salve for these issues.Q. Beyond the Olympics, where is Brazil when it comes to race? How does it compare to the United States?But the reality speaks for itself in Brazil: the huge gaps in opportunity in access, in wealth, in living conditions \u2014 that\u2019s so obvious in the country.Something that\u2019s fascinating in Brazil right now is there are these different movements coalescing around the country clamoring for more rights and more access to institutions of power around the country. It\u2019s similar to what we\u2019ve seen in the United States before, but they are also going about it in their own way.Sadly, in Brazil, there is also just a grim sense of acceptance of the inequality that still persists in so many spheres of life in the country.It\u2019s been interesting to witness from afar the debate over #BlackLivesMatter and the killing of police there in the United States because Brazil suffers from the exactly same problem but in a more intense way; far more people are killed by police in Brazil than in the United States, but the public conversation around those killings is really just starting.It\u2019s like many communities are just, I don\u2019t know, bewildered by the challenges they are facing.Advertisement"}
