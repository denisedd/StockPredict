{"Headline": "Wet Blanket", "Date": "2016-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWordplaySATURDAY PUZZLE \u2014 Thank goodness for fill-in-the-blank clues. On a Saturday, they can be life savers. Generally the easiest type of clue because your brain loves filling in missing information, even the fill-in-the-blanks are tougher on a Saturday, but they can also provide us with a much-needed toehold in an otherwise impenetrable puzzle. I got started in Mark Diehl\u2019s puzzle in just this way, filling in \u201cThe ODESSA File,\u201d Edmond DANTES, and ANSON Williams right off the bat.The best way to expand your territory from there is to look for clues that are in your wheelhouse, or that involve topics with which you are familiar. I haven\u2019t gotten around to reading it, but I knew that Nikola TESLA\u2019s biography is called \u201cLightning in His Hand,\u201d so in that went as well.Next, assume that almost everything will be misdirected in some way. Set your brain the task of unraveling these clues, and take nothing at face value. Even a clue like \u201cBacking for a cartoonist\u201d sounds like we\u2019re supposed to be thinking about financial backing, but we\u2019re not; the answer is ART BOARD. On Saturday, you may or may not see a question mark at the end of a clue.Dr. Diehl (he has a D.D.S.) debuts 11 entries today, and my favorite of these is SMOKY TOPAZ. Other entries that caught my eye were RUMBLE SEAT, GROANER and UP-TEMPO.\u2022 11A: A \u201cTall tale producer?\u201d can be a fibber, but it can also be IMAX, which produces movies that are shown on very big screens.\u2022 18A: If you\u2019re going to guess in a game of \u201cBattleship,\u201d it might as well be D-TEN, right? This was tough to get from the crossings, but I had X AND Y AXES, noted that the clue probably had to do with the board game, what with \u201cBattleship\u201d capitalized at the beginning of the clue, and took a huge leap of faith. Eventually getting 11D helped.\u2022 27A: Has your brain become primed to question any clue with a question mark? If you\u2019ve been reading for a while, it\u2019s a good habit to establish. A \u201cwet blanket\u201d is an idiom that means \u201cparty pooper\u201d in some circles, but if you think about it, DEW can be a wet blanket, too.\u2022 30A: Math alert! Well, not really; all you have to know is the number ONE. In the clue \u201cGirl\u2019s name in which the last three letters are equivalent to the first?\u201d, ONE is equivalent to 1 or I, so the answer is IONE.\u2022 46A: Speaking of the number one, read this clue carefully: \u201cOne not yet one, say\u201d hints at someone who is not yet the age of one, or an INFANT.\u2022 1D: \u201cOne might be involved in a sting\u201d is the kind of clue that should perk up your brain cells, especially on a Saturday. It sounds perfectly innocent, doesn\u2019t it? It\u2019s probably talking about some law enforcement sting operation, wouldn\u2019t you think? Not a chance. Stay suspicious, my friends. If you see a clue sitting there all quiet and innocent-like, immediately become suspicious and start thinking of alternate meanings for the word \u201csting.\u201d Today, the answer is WASP.\u2022 3D: Another clue word to look for: \u201cit.\u201d Use it as a substitution for the answer, if that helps. In the clue \u201cStick with it,\u201d you\u2019re being misled into thinking that the answer has to do with persistence, but it doesn\u2019t here. If you reread the clue as \u201cStick with ___,\u201d you\u2019re much closer to guessing that the answer is TAPE.\u2022 26D: Use the crossings, Luke. That\u2019s pretty much the only way I know of to get ONE IN FORTY for \u201c2.5%.\u201dI usually try to set a goal or two for every themeless I make.It may be specific entries I\u2019d like to see the light of day in a puzzle, or perhaps a wide-open grid that has caught my eye, or even an interesting stacking pattern in the middle of the grid. For this puzzle I wanted W-X-Y-Z in the four corners, in order. Nailed it!Also wanted dual symmetry with radiating triple stacks of 10-letter entries in each corner. Failed on both counts by including a pair of cheater squares when I became enamored with X AND Y AXES. Oh well. But I did like the open flow through the center from the stacks. I picture this type of center like the tines of a pasta server with intertwined entries acting like spaghetti flowing every which way in the grid. Yum.Your thoughts?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Speeds Toward a Driverless Future, Putting Jobs in Danger", "Date": "2016-08-18", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsTravis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s chief executive, has made no secret of wanting to replace its chauffeurs with cars that can ferry passengers without driver input. Uber is not alone. From old-school car and truck manufacturers and parts makers to Silicon Valley interlopers like Tesla, Apple and Alphabet, dozens of companies are racing to develop driverless technology.Along with saving valuable time, fully autonomous vehicles could reduce traffic accidents by 90 percent or more, the Boston Consulting Group has estimated. That would avoid hundreds of billions of dollars in injuries, vehicle damage and lost productivity caused by traffic accidents, which kill more than 30,000 Americans each year.There is a big downside, though. Heavy trucking employs nearly two million people across the United States, with a median salary of over $40,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That is about double what hundreds of thousands of others employed as taxi and limousine drivers make. Both industries are now firmly in Uber\u2019s cross hairs.The jobs might not disappear completely, of course. Moreover, shifting from today\u2019s limited autonomy features like automatic braking and lane correction to truly self-driving vehicles across the country is a huge technology challenge that could take years and draw serious political resistance. Even in a fully autonomous world, freight haulers and livery services would still need mechanics and tech specialists to keep fleets rolling.Still, the threat is clear. And America\u2019s threadbare social safety net and worker-retraining programs may struggle to support a mass retooling of skills. That would heap further pressure on working-class communities already reeling from the loss of more than five million manufacturing jobs over the last two decades.Uber\u2019s new partnerships are the latest sign that the push to driverless is accelerating. Policy makers and politicians should consider themselves forewarned.Advertisement"}

They are something else altogether.The 488 GTB, which is the successor to the 458, is an automobile to be sure, but also equal parts art, science, music and Six Flags roller coaster riding on an aluminum structure.Want to know what it\u2019s like to be Oprah? Buy one of these. Fingers point. People jump and scream. Hundreds of smartphone cameras bear down on the sensuous aluminum skin. You\u2019ve been warned.This passport to instant celebrity status starts at about $250,000, but, undoubtedly, most 488 buyers will want extras. The example I\u2019m swooning over is $353,858, meaning the cost of the options alone would outfit a family of four with new Honda Civics for all. Of course, if you have to ask how much, you probably can\u2019t afford it.A blizzard of carbon fiber pieces make up most of the upcharges; the rear diffuser alone is $9,616. Don\u2019t miss the Goldrake carbon fiber seats at $10,799 (available in small, medium and large). Oh, and the $12,486 Rosso Corsa metallic paint is a must. God intended all Ferraris to have red paint this rich.Its predecessor, the 458, was naturally aspirated. The 3.9-liter V8 in the 488 gets twin-turbocharging. The result is a staggering 661 horsepower (or would that be stallions?) and 561 pound-feet of torque. Fun fact. The 488 gets its moniker from the displacement of each cylinder: 488cc.Power is routed to the back wheels through a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox. Nope, a manual transmission is not available for the three of you in America who might want one. Drive modes tailor the car from racetrack-ready to slogging through a crowd of drooling admirers. The 488 can be a pussycat to drive, if you want.It can also be a Saturn V rocket. Everyone should experience a zero to 60 miles-an-hour rush of 2.9 seconds at least once. The 488\u2019s precision and velocity make it easy to look down after a launch to discover triple digits on the speedo. I get it, Tesla\u2019s Model S can achieve similar oomph. The S does it, however, without (and this is important!) the operatic mechanical note that the Ferrari sings. It drills deep into your soul and never goes away.I\u2019d be lying if I claimed to have discovered the GTB\u2019s handling limits. It simply can\u2019t be done on public roads. Curved fins under the body near the front tires act as vortex generators, increasing downforce. Look closely at the huge gills on the rear hips to find they aren\u2019t just for engine cooling, they also vent out near the taillamps. Those and a subtle slot integrated into the tail act as aerodynamic aids. No tacked-on wings or spoilers sully the seductive shape here.This is not a quiet car \u2014 thank goodness \u2014 nor softly sprung. And while the adjustable suspension goes nowhere near cushy, a 200-mile day in the 488 GTB doesn\u2019t wring the life force out of a driver. Wallets take a drubbing though. Heavy on highway miles (and admittedly, much hard right-foot activity), I managed 17 miles per gallon using premium fuel. The E.P.A. rates it at 15 city and 22 highway.If I were judging this as a practical car, I\u2019d complain that the front trunk can carry only two carry-on-size suitcases, the navigational system is cumbersome to operate and my particular copy lacked a much-needed backup camera. There\u2019s no sunroof option either, so you\u2019ll have to go with the retractable-paneled Spider version for more sun. Sadly, the convertible also eliminates the crowd-pleasing glass dome that showcases the V8. Those form-fitting Goldrake seats are manually adjusted (a plus for me, actually).But no one turns to Maranello for practicality. Keep in mind, even if you have the funds to pay for a Ferrari, you can\u2019t just waltz into a dealership to snap one up. It takes time, and the company is known to cater to the faithful first.But if I\u2019ve persuaded you that you simply can\u2019t go another day without a 488, there\u2019s always the chance that a buyer has had a change of heart (or fortune). So don\u2019t be discouraged. And even if you have to wait, it will be worth it. To quote Ferris Bueller, \u201cIf you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Bolt\u2019s Long Shadow, Ashton Eaton\u2019s Excellence Peeks Through", "Date": "2016-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn OlympicsRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The decathletes, long ago a source of greater fascination, were in no position Thursday night to be anything more than a warm-up act for the headliner Usain Bolt.There is no dishonor in that. Bolt, with his easy charm and easily understood talents, is an irresistible force in the attention-grabbing department.Even before the Rio Olympics, he was considered the greatest sprinter ever. Now he is the first, and quite possibly the last, to sweep the 100 meters and the 200 meters in three consecutive Games.But there is potential all-time greatness at work in the decathlon, too, and Ashton Eaton has a very different task and style from Bolt.Bolt\u2019s events are over in a flash: 9.81 seconds in the 100, then 19.78 seconds in the 200. Eaton\u2019s work unfolds over two days and nights and 10 events, some of them contested in the heat of the day with few spectators in the stadium.Bolt is playful and brash, mugging for the cameras, pounding his chest and merrily reminding his frustrated opponents of their lot in life during and after the racing. Consider Thursday\u2019s comment about the 200-meter silver medalist Andre De Grasse, made with De Grasse sitting next to him: \u201cYou should always want to be the best,\u201d Bolt said. \u201cI respect him for that, but I tell every youngster, I don\u2019t allow young kids to beat me.\u2019\u201dEaton is measured and modest and would no sooner talk smack than he would turn down a chance to meet Elon Musk, the tech entrepreneur behind Tesla and SpaceX, who is Eaton\u2019s true aspirational figure.\u201cI think Ash might prefer being an engineer sometimes; I really do,\u201d said Don Butzner, Eaton\u2019s physical therapist.For now, he remains a decathlete, and though the focus Thursday was on Bolt\u2019s eighth career gold medal, Eaton joined an elite club of his own by successfully defending his Olympic title.\u201cThe decathlon is exclusive company,\u201d Eaton said after beating the fast-improving Frenchman K\u00e9vin Mayer for gold with a total of 8,893 points. \u201cI\u2019m just happy to be part of the family, the decathlon family, regardless of the records.\u201dIt does feel more like a brotherhood than a guild, and one of the more reaffirming moments in sports is when the decathlon\u2019s final event, the 1,500 meters, is done and the exhausted contestants \u2014 when they\u2019ve finally picked themselves up after collapsing \u2014 congratulate one another for simply finishing.\u201cWe are competing against ourselves,\u201d Eaton said.By that standard, Eaton lost Thursday, failing to surpass his world-record score of 9,045 points, set last year at the world championships in Beijing. But by purely Olympic standards, it was a more successful night, one that also gave the Eaton family its second track and field medal of these Games.Eaton\u2019s wife, Brianne Theisen-Eaton, who trains with him under their coach, Harry Marra, won a bronze medal last week for Canada in the heptathlon, the seven-event women\u2019s competition.She was there in the Olympic Stadium on Thursday night, just as Eaton had been there for her last week when he took some seriously out-of-line internet flak for wearing a Canada cap as a show of support.\u201cShe is a massive, massive inspiration for me,\u201d Eaton said Thursday. \u201cAnd for us to have done this together is \u2026\u201dHis voice began to break. \u201cI can\u2019t word it,\u201d he said, moving down the line in the interview area.Eaton had a string of injuries \u2014 nagging and more significant \u2014 this season. He tore a quadriceps muscle during a meet in the Czech Republic on May 20, which gave him little more than a month to heal before the United States Olympic trials in Eugene, Ore., in early July. \u201cIt was scary,\u201d Marra said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know whether that muscle would stay together at the trials. One event? O.K. But 10 events? Come on.\u201dThe problem, Marra said, was \u201ca big blood clot\u201d that was restricting Eaton\u2019s range of leg motion. \u201cLess than a week before the trials, they went in with a needle,\u201d Marra said. \u201cAnd the doctor says, \u2018Here we go,\u2019 and he pulled on this thing and the clot pulled right out into the syringe, and you could just see the muscle go back to its normal position.\u201dMarra said Eaton, by compensating for the quad injury, then strained a hamstring early in the trials and made just one attempt in the long jump. That jump, according to Marra, was Eaton\u2019s only one between May 20 and the Olympics, in an effort to protect his leg.That should help explain why Eaton never seriously challenged his world record in Rio, although he did tie the Olympic record.Afterward, there was \u2014 as is now customary at major championships \u2014 considerable discussion of why the decathlon, once the de facto method to determine the world\u2019s greatest athlete, has dipped in prestige since Bruce Jenner won it in 1976.It is about declining attention spans colliding with an event that unfolds sporadically over two days; about ever more air and space occupied by the major team sports. It is about the dearth of major track and field moments in the United States between Olympics, where the glut of medal events means competition for mindshare even at the Games is ever fiercer.It is also about the esoteric nature of the decathlon itself: an early-20th-century tribute to the ancient Greek pentathlon with a mix of running, jumping and throwing events, including the 100 meters, the long jump, the discus and shot-put and the pole vault.\u201cI don\u2019t think it has the reverence from the public that it used to, and I think that\u2019s part of the problem,\u201d said Ato Boldon, a track analyst and former sprinter.Eaton and others agree that there is a lack of understanding of the decathlon\u2019s rigors and particulars. Eaton said that he liked the comedian Bill Murray\u2019s suggestion that they put \u201can average Joe\u201d into every event to provide a frame of reference.For now, ask the average Joe to name the world\u2019s greatest athlete, and the odds are good that he would come up with LeBron James or Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo or even Bolt before coming up with Eaton.\u201cIt all depends what you\u2019re talking about when you say greatest athlete,\u201d said Karl Robert Saluri, a decathlete from Estonia. \u201cIn my view, Ashton is the best all-around athlete.\u201dThat seems a smarter way of phrasing it. Who else has to get so good at so many diverse athletic skills, and then spend four years building to their major moment?Marra, 69, said he would not be coaching the Eatons for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. Eaton, 28, said he put the chances at \u201cless than 50 percent\u201d that he would still be competing in 2020.All the more reason then for coach and pupil to savor the moment Thursday night, even if it had to be savored in the shadow of Bolt.Not that there was bitterness. This was Ashton Eaton, after all.\u201cIt has been a pleasure being in the same era,\u201d Eaton said. \u201cI mean, the guy\u2019s last name is Bolt, and he\u2019s the fastest man ever. You can\u2019t write a story like that, and so to be in the pages in there is nice.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Space-age adhesives are being used more widely, just one of the many leaps manufacturers are taking to reduce weight and save fuel.But to continue their gains, automakers must find additional innovations. One promising technology on the horizon is a new type of gas-electric hybrid that draws power from a 48-volt battery, which is more powerful than a standard 12-volt auto battery but less expensive and less complicated than the power packs of 200 volts or more found in hybrids like the Toyota Prius.The 48-volt battery drives an electric motor that gives the engine an extra 20 or so horsepower, cutting fuel use in starts and acceleration.Mary Gustanski, vice president of engineering and program management at Delphi, an auto supplier that is going to produce 48-volt systems for car companies, believes these hybrids can improve the fuel economy of normal gasoline-powered cars by 15 percent or more with little additional cost. \u201cIs it leaps and bounds?\u201d she said. \u201cNo, but does it move us further along? Definitely.\u201dHyundai Motor, the Korean automaker, is \u201cworking very hard on 48-volt technology,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Brien, the company\u2019s vice president of corporate and product planning. He declined to say when those cars would be on the market. G.M. also expects to offer 48-volt cars in the United States market in the next few years, an executive said.Ms. Gustanski said Delphi\u2019s technology would first appear in Europe and China in 2018. Continental, another supplier, plans to begin producing 48-volt systems for automakers by the end of this year.Even with new technologies, automakers still have a steep uphill climb to keep pace with gas-mileage targets. By 2025, they are supposed to sell a fleet of vehicles that hits an average of 54.5 miles per gallon.That number is based on a complicated formula that gives credits for reducing emissions from air-conditioners and selling electric vehicles, among other things. In real-world driving, the target equals a fleet average of about 40 miles per gallon. The average for cars and light trucks that were sold in July was 25.4 miles per gallon, according to the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute.Last month, a joint report from the Environmental Protection Agency and the Transportation Department said automakers were probably able to reach only an average rating of about 50 miles per gallon by 2025 \u2014 about 36 miles per gallon in real-world situations.The main problem is that low gasoline prices and the absence of high fuel taxes that are common in most other advanced industrial nations have enticed Americans to move away from cars and buy more pickup trucks and S.U.V.s, which score lower on fuel efficiency.Missing the 2025 target would result in higher levels of carbon dioxide emissions, which regulators are trying to reduce in a bid to battle climate change.Regulators have just begun a review of the fuel-efficiency standards and by April 2018 must decide whether to ease them in some ways \u2014 a path automakers would prefer \u2014 or leave them unchanged.Automakers and regulators are at odds. At an industry conference in Michigan earlier this month, the E.P.A.\u2019s director for air quality, Christopher Grundler, shrugged off suggestions that the 2025 target should be lowered. He said the standards were \u201cworking spectacularly,\u201d and noted that carmakers had made good progress and already offered many models that met the 2025 level.These include hybrid and plug-in models from Ford Motor, Hyundai, Toyota and others, as well as pure electric vehicles like Tesla models and G.M.\u2019s Chevrolet Bolt. Ford\u2019s aluminum-bodied F-150 pickup truck, when equipped with the company\u2019s EcoBoost V6 engine, comes close to the 2025 requirement \u2014 23 miles per gallon in real-world driving \u2014 for vehicles of that size.Automakers agree that electric cars offer impressive fuel-economy numbers, but counter that consumers buy too few of them to move the average number. The big challenge, they say, is in improving fuel economy in conventional gasoline-powered cars without adding so much cost that consumers turn away.\u201cIt is going to be extremely difficult for traditional powertrains to hit those targets in the last couple of years\u201d leading to 2025, said Richard L. Gezelle, a senior program manager at Toyota.Toyota is one automaker that has less interest in 48-volt \u201cmild\u201d hybrids, as they are known in the industry. Mr. Gezelle said his company thought automakers would need to focus more on breakthrough technologies \u2014 such as electric cars and hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles \u2014 that can meet the 2025 standard and continue improving fuel efficiency beyond then.For now, automakers are making gains from a series of technologies they started introducing about six years ago. These include shrinking the size of engines while adding turbocharging, which increases power and efficiency by forcing extra air into an engine. This approach enables a 4-cylinder engine to put out about the same power as a traditional V6, and a V6 to replace a V8.At the same time, automakers are hoping for advancements from a new wave of innovations.

He said the standards were \u201cworking spectacularly,\u201d and noted that carmakers had made good progress and already offered many models that met the 2025 level.These include hybrid and plug-in models from Ford Motor, Hyundai, Toyota and others, as well as pure electric vehicles like Tesla models and G.M.\u2019s Chevrolet Bolt. Ford\u2019s aluminum-bodied F-150 pickup truck, when equipped with the company\u2019s EcoBoost V6 engine, comes close to the 2025 requirement \u2014 23 miles per gallon in real-world driving \u2014 for vehicles of that size.Automakers agree that electric cars offer impressive fuel-economy numbers, but counter that consumers buy too few of them to move the average number. The big challenge, they say, is in improving fuel economy in conventional gasoline-powered cars without adding so much cost that consumers turn away.\u201cIt is going to be extremely difficult for traditional powertrains to hit those targets in the last couple of years\u201d leading to 2025, said Richard L. Gezelle, a senior program manager at Toyota.Toyota is one automaker that has less interest in 48-volt \u201cmild\u201d hybrids, as they are known in the industry. Mr. Gezelle said his company thought automakers would need to focus more on breakthrough technologies \u2014 such as electric cars and hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles \u2014 that can meet the 2025 standard and continue improving fuel efficiency beyond then.For now, automakers are making gains from a series of technologies they started introducing about six years ago. These include shrinking the size of engines while adding turbocharging, which increases power and efficiency by forcing extra air into an engine. This approach enables a 4-cylinder engine to put out about the same power as a traditional V6, and a V6 to replace a V8.At the same time, automakers are hoping for advancements from a new wave of innovations.

{"Headline": "Setting the Body\u2019s \u2018Serial Killers\u2019 Loose on Cancer", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "After a long, intense pursuit, researchers are close to bringing to market a daring new treatment: cell therapy that turbocharges the immune system to fight cancer.Supported byBETHESDA, Md. \u2014 The young surgeon was mystified. A fist-size tumor had been removed from the stomach of his patient 12 years earlier, but his doctors had not been able to cut out many smaller growths in his liver. The cancer should have killed him, yet here he lay on the table for a routine gallbladder operation.The surgeon, Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg, examined the man\u2019s abdominal cavity, sifting his liver in his fingers, feeling for hard, dense tumors \u2014 but he could find no trace of cancer.It was 1968. Dr. Rosenberg had a hunch he had just witnessed an extraordinary case in which a patient\u2019s immune system had vanquished cancer. Hoping there was an elixir in the man\u2019s blood, Dr. Rosenberg got permission to transfuse some of it into a patient dying of stomach cancer. The effort failed. But it was the beginning of a lifelong quest.\u201cSomething began to burn in me,\u201d he would write later, \u201csomething that has never gone out.\u201dHalf a century later, Dr. Rosenberg, who turns 76 on Tuesday and is chief of surgery at the National Cancer Institute here, is part of a small fraternity of researchers who have doggedly pursued a dream \u2014 turbocharging the body\u2019s immune system so that more cancer patients can experience recoveries like his long-ago patient\u2019s.Dr. Rosenberg, Dr. Carl H. June of the University of Pennsylvania and Dr. Michel Sadelain of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center have been at the forefront of this research for decades, laboring in separate labs in an intense sometimes-cooperative, sometimes-competitive pursuit to bring to fruition a daring therapy that few colleagues believed would work. Now, versions of the therapy for a limited number of blood cancers are nearing approval by federal regulators, and could reach the market as early as next year.The technique, known as cell therapy, gives each patient an individualized and souped-up version of their own immune system, one that \u201cworks better than nature made it,\u201d as Dr. June puts it.The patient\u2019s T-cells, the soldiers of the immune system, are extracted from the patient\u2019s blood, then genetically engineered to recognize and destroy cancer. The redesigned cells are multiplied in the laboratory, and millions or billions of them are put back into the patient\u2019s bloodstream, set loose like a vast army of tumor assassins.This is an unusual pharmaceutical \u2014 a drug that is alive and can multiply once inside the body. Dr. June calls these cells \u201cserial killers.\u201d A single one can destroy up to 100,000 cancer cells.The killer cells are genetically engineered to produce a complex protein, an amalgam of pieces from different parts of the immune system that is unlike anything seen before.\u201cI call it a Frankenstein-like molecule,\u201d said Dr. Renier J. Brentjens, the director of cellular therapeutics at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.This radical, science-fictionlike therapy differs sharply from the more established type of immunotherapy, developed by other researchers. Those off-the-shelf drugs, known as checkpoint inhibitors, release a molecular brake on the immune system, freeing it to fight the cancer much as it fights infections by bacteria or viruses.Cell therapy, in contrast, is brewed specially for each patient, one of the many challenges the field faces in broadening its use. So far, the number of patients treated with cell therapy is in the hundreds, not thousands. And for now it works only for certain types of blood cancers, not common malignancies like breast and lung cancer. Researchers are also still working out how to control potentially lethal side effects. Just recently, a clinical trial was briefly halted after three patients died of brain swelling.Still, cell therapy has produced complete remissions in some patients who were out of treatment options, stirring excitement among doctors and patients and setting off a race among companies to bring the treatments to market.Getting to this point has taken decades of painstaking work, with many false starts and setbacks.\u201cIt was conceivable we were pursuing a ghost,\u201d Dr. Rosenberg recalled.The son of Orthodox Jews who immigrated from Poland to New York and ran luncheonettes, Steven Rosenberg was about 6 years old when his family learned that many relatives, including six of his father\u2019s nine siblings, had been murdered in the Holocaust.\u201cI saw so much evil in the world that early on I decided I wanted to do something that would help people, not hurt people,\u201d he said in an interview here. He received a medical degree from Johns Hopkins and a doctorate in biophysics from Harvard.From the start, he was a workaholic. At one point he tried to call off his relationship with Alice O\u2019Connell, whom he would later marry, because he was afraid it would distract him from research.\u201cI loved the night,\u201d Dr. Rosenberg wrote in his book, \u201cThe Transformed Cell,\u201d published in 1992. \u201cI remember the exhilaration of working through the night in the lab, drinking thick pasty coffee that had been on the burner for hours, walking out into the sunrise.\u201d He added: \u201cTo be alone and out on the edge like that, there was no feeling like it in the world.\u201dWhen Dr. Rosenberg arrived at the National Cancer Institute in 1974, his first attempt at immunotherapy was to give patients T-cells harvested from pigs. That failed.He then began giving patients interleukin-2, or IL-2, a protein made by the body that spurs T-cells to proliferate. In some cases he treated patients with their own white blood cells that had been incubated in IL-2. The treatments sometimes set off such a violent immune system reaction that patients had to be placed in intensive care.From 1980 to 1984, he treated 66 patients without success. Then, in late 1984, he encountered patient No. 67, Linda Taylor, a Navy officer with melanoma whose personnel file carried the stamp \u201cdeath imminent.\u201dThe New York Times would like to hear from doctors and patients who have experience giving or receiving immunotherapy treatment for cancer.Ms. Taylor is still alive; her case and others catapulted Dr. Rosenberg and IL-2 onto the cover of Newsweek and the front pages of newspapers. Some of his colleagues at the National Cancer Institute began referring to him as Stevie Wonder, thinking he had developed a swelled head.But IL-2\u2019s vaunted prowess fizzled, helping only a few percent of patients with melanoma or kidney cancer.Dr. Rosenberg then tried to surgically remove tumors and extract the T-cells that had already penetrated them, so-called tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. He multiplied those cells in the lab and infused them back in the patient, along with shots of IL-2. He limited his focus to melanoma, the skin cancer that seemed most susceptible to immune attack.The treatment eventually achieved remissions in about 10 percent to 25 percent of patients. But it was labor-intensive and its application to other cancers unclear.There had to be a better way. Indeed, one approach was taking shape across the street from Dr. Rosenberg, at the Naval Medical Research Institute in Bethesda.The Navy was not Carl June\u2019s desired career choice. Accepted at Stanford in 1971, he instead chose the Naval Academy to avoid the draft and Vietnam. The Navy sent him to medical school and for training in bone-marrow transplantation, geared toward treating people irradiated by nuclear weapons.When the Cold War ended, the Navy lost interest.Dr. June turned to working with T-cells at the Naval Medical Research Institute in the mid-1980s. He and a colleague, Dr. Bruce Levine, found a way to multiply T-cells in huge numbers outside the body, a method still used today. And in the mid-1990s, working with Cell Genesys, a gene therapy company, Dr. June began trying to genetically modify patients\u2019 T-cells to kill H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS.But when his wife, Cindy, the mother of the couple\u2019s three children, developed ovarian cancer in 1996, Dr. June\u2019s research turned personal.Dr. June had tried everything to save her, including the primitive immune therapies under development. But Ms. June died in 2001.\u201cA lot of other scientists would have been disillusioned by the failure, in his case the personal tragedy,\u201d said Sean Parker, the internet billionaire who is funding some of Dr. June\u2019s work.Instead, Dr. June, who had moved to the University of Pennsylvania, stopped treating patients, and devoted himself to creating cell therapies for cancer.\u201cThings that were back burner on cell therapy became front burner,\u201d he said.In the 1980s, scientists began experimenting with gene therapy, putting new genes into cells of the body to treat disease. Michel Sadelain, while still a graduate student studying immunology at the University of Alberta, told colleagues that he thought the technique could be used to supercharge T-cells to fight cancer.\u201cAt the time it sounded very pipe dream,\u201d said Douglas Green, who was one of Dr. Sadelain\u2019s doctoral thesis advisers and is now chairman of immunology at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital.But Dr. Sadelain, he continued, \u201cbelieved in his approach and he pursued it relentlessly.\u201dAfter earning his Ph.D., Dr. Sadelain headed for the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Mass., to learn how to do gene therapy, using disabled viruses that could not cause disease to deliver genes into cells. By 1992, he had demonstrated that he could genetically engineer mouse T-cells.He then moved to Sloan Kettering. In 2003, he and his colleagues \u2014 including his partner and now wife, Isabelle Rivi\u00e8re \u2014 showed that genetically engineered T-cells could eradicate certain cancers in mice.How is this done? To fight cancer, T-cells have to recognize cancerous cells.Each T-cell in the body has unique receptors, sort of like claws that jut out from its surface. T-cells patrol the body looking for protein fragments that indicate a cell might be infected by a bacterium or virus. If one of its claws latches on to such a fragment, the T-cell destroys the cell displaying it.But cancer cells are mutated versions of the body\u2019s own cells, not outsiders. T-cells do not always recognize them as something to kill.So scientists like Dr. Sadelain decided to put a new claw on the T-cells, one that could recognize cancer by latching on to a telltale protein on cancer cells.The new claws came from another part of the immune system known as antibodies. Drug companies already knew how to make antibodies with claws that bind to specific proteins in the body.But the claw was not enough. Once a claw binds to a target protein, it needs a molecule to signal the T-cell to go into killing mode. Yet another signal helps sustain the killing. The DNA instructions for all three components are inserted into the patient\u2019s T-cells.Since this concoction is part antibody and part T-cell, it is a chimera, like the monster of Greek mythology that is part lion, part goat and part serpent. The claw is called a receptor and the protein it binds to on the cancer cell, the target, is called an antigen. So the whole construct is called a chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, and the use of it to treat cancer is called CAR T-cell therapy, or CAR-T.Dr. Sadelain was not alone in this work. Zelig Eshhar, an Israeli scientist, is credited with developing one of the first crude CARs around 1989. Dr. Rosenberg, always on the lookout for new types of immunotherapy, invited Dr. Eshhar to be a visiting scientist in his laboratory at the National Cancer Institute.Another early developer was Dr. Dario Campana of St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital.As scientists worked to perfect the formula in the 1990s and early 2000s, there was quite a bit of sharing. Cancer cell therapy was still mostly an academic exercise; it was highly uncertain whether it would ever really work.Dr. June, after hearing a presentation by Dr. Campana at a conference in 2003, requested a sample of Dr. Campana\u2019s CAR. Dr. Sadelain shared his design with both Dr. June and Dr. Rosenberg. The most prominent CAR developed at the National Cancer Institute owes a lot to Dr. Sadelain, Dr. Rosenberg said.But the science proved difficult and the research money scarce. Pharmaceutical companies showed little interest, preferring mass-produced drugs, one size fits all, rather than a treatment that would be made separately for each patient.Again, a death from cancer propelled the field forward. In 2001, a 44-year-old woman, Kimberly Lawrence Netter, succumbed to breast cancer. Her father-in-law, Edward Netter, a wealthy financial services entrepreneur, and his wife, Barbara, formed the nonprofit Alliance for Cancer Gene Therapy, which issued some of its first grants to Dr. June and Dr. Sadelain. Dr. June also got support from the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.\u201cWithout that,\u201d Dr. June said of the charities, \u201cwe would not have had a clinical trial.\u201dAs the first decade of this century neared its end, the three pioneers were ready for the big moment \u2014 testing their treatments in patients. They scrambled to be the first to announce peer-reviewed results.Dr. Rosenberg and colleagues published first, in the journal Blood in 2010. They described a single patient with lymphoma whose tumors shrank after treatment. (The patient later received more therapy, and has been free of cancer since.)But the approach really attracted attention the next year when Dr. June reported that two of three patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia went into complete remission.One of them, Doug Olson, a chemist from Tinicum Township, Pa., left the hospital and immediately bought a sailboat. He also took to running half-marathons.\u201cIt was like this weight that had been sitting there was gone,\u201d said Mr. Olson, who is free of cancer nearly six years later.Bill Ludwig, a retired captain in the New Jersey Department of Corrections, had already paid for his funeral when he started treatment in August 2010. Once his genetically engineered T-cells were unleashed in his system, Mr. Ludwig\u2019s lungs started to fail, his legs ballooned to twice their size, his blood pressure dropped and he began hallucinating.When he emerged from the ordeal, doctors searched for cancer. Detecting none, they ordered another test, certain of error. But there was no mistake. Five pounds of tumor had been destroyed.Mr. Ludwig, now 71, and his wife bought an R.V. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make up for lost time,\u201d he said. He has celebrated the high school graduations of five grandchildren and welcomed his first great-grandchild.As for Dr. June, Mr. Ludwig said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe someone who basically saved your life. He lost the one he loved, and turned around and saved me years later.\u201dThe 2011 publication of Dr. June\u2019s results transformed the field.Novartis, the big Swiss pharmaceutical company, licensed the rights to the therapies created in Dr. June\u2019s lab at the University of Pennsylvania, throwing aside concerns that treatments manufactured for individual patients would not be good business. That set off a commercial rush, flooding the field with cash after years of doubt.While various companies are in pursuit, three are in the lead. They hope to win approval from the Food and Drug Administration to bring the first CAR treatments to market as early as 2017 or 2018, although it is not yet clear how easy it will be to get regulatory approval for such a novel therapy.The companies are teamed with academic pioneers: Novartis with Penn; Kite Pharma with the National Cancer Institute; and Juno Therapeutics with Sloan Kettering, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital.Somewhat predictably, success provoked jostling and envy. Rather than being allies against a disbelieving world, the pioneers now had something worth fighting over \u2014 credit, and the gleam of a possible Nobel Prize.While the Sloan Kettering researchers had done some of the early genetic engineering, they did not publish strong results in five patients until 2013. By then, they had been scooped by Dr. Rosenberg with one patient and Dr. June with three.St. Jude sued the University of Pennsylvania. Novartis sided with Penn, and Juno Therapeutics with St. Jude.Patrick M. Coughlin, who teaches anatomy at the Commonwealth Medical College in Scranton, Pa., now explains the immune system to his classes by telling how one man overcame cancer. Only gradually does it become clear that he is referring to himself.Now 63, Mr. Coughlin noticed a mass the size of a softball in his abdomen in summer 2013. It was a form of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. Three different types of chemotherapy and a bone-marrow transplant all failed to help him. Desperate, he came to the National Institutes of Health campus here last year for the cell therapy developed by Dr. Rosenberg\u2019s team.The battle between Mr. Coughlin\u2019s genetically engineered immune cells and the cancer was brutal. For four days he had a fever as high as 105, chills and bed-soaking sweats. Even his brain malfunctioned \u2014 at one point he could not count to 10 or write his wife\u2019s name.But when the battle ended, the cancer was no longer there. \u201cIf I had gotten this thing five years ago,\u201d he said of his disease, \u201cI\u2019d be dead.\u201dYet for all the excitement, there are reasons for caution. The CAR therapy works now only for patients with some B-cell lymphomas and leukemias, which account for only about 80,000 of the 1.7 million cases of cancer diagnosed in the United States each year. It has not been successfully used to treat malignancies of the lungs, breast, prostate, colon or other organs.\u201cThe solid tumors that kill over 90 percent of people do not respond to anything we have now,\u201d Dr. Rosenberg said.Because it is personalized, cell therapy is likely to be frightfully expensive \u2014 probably hundreds of thousands of dollars per patient, though the companies bringing these treatments to market have not yet said how much they would charge.Producing the re-engineered cells is lengthy and complex. Some patients have died during the two to four weeks it took to genetically modify and multiply their cells.And the therapy itself can be arduous. First, patients get chemotherapy to wipe out many of their existing T-cells to make room for the engineered ones. Once those enter the body, they can set off a ferocious immune response as well as temporary neurological problems like memory loss, seizures and hallucinations.Recently Juno Therapeutics had to temporarily halt its clinical trial after three patients died from brain swelling. The problem arose when the company added a second chemotherapy drug to the regimen preparing the patients for the cell infusion. The authorities allowed the trial to resume without that chemotherapy drug.Still, some patients find themselves hoping they get violently ill, since that is a sign the treatment is working.\u201cEvery morning my wife would ask me how I\u2019m feeling,\u201d said Myles Stiefvater, a copier salesman from Newark, Del., who had the treatment in 2014. When he said he felt O.K., they were disappointed.Researchers are also finding, to their dismay, that remissions do not always last. The therapy has had its biggest success in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, producing complete remissions for 60 percent to more than 90 percent of patients. Yet up to half of those patients eventually suffer a relapse.In some cases, the tumor evolves so that it no longer displays on its surface what the claw binds to, making it invisible to the engineered cells. In other cases, the engineered cells might not last long enough in the body, giving the cancer a chance to resurge.Karen Shollenberger, a student at Drexel University with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, thought she was in the clear after being in remission for nine months after a CAR-T treatment.But in September, as the school year was beginning, the cancer returned.She entered a new trial testing a new CAR therapy directed at another protein on B-cells. Again the cancer went into remission, and she returned to school.But fear lurked in her: What if the new therapy also stopped working? That indeed happened recently. Her best hope now is a bone-marrow transplant.\u201cEach relapse is increasingly terrifying as the options continue to shrink,\u201d said Ms. Shollenberger, 22. But, she said, the cell therapies have given her nearly two good years.The big thrust now is to expand the use of cell therapy to additional types of cancer.The key is to find protein targets that the engineered T-cells can latch on to to kill cancer cells. Ideally, such a protein should be on all the tumor cells, so the entire cancer would be eradicated. But it should not be on healthy cells, or they would also be destroyed, causing side effects.\u201cT-cells are very powerful,\u201d said Dr. Campana, formerly of St. Jude and now at the National University of Singapore. \u201cIn the same way they can eliminate cancer, they can also kill you.\u201dA protein called HER2, for instance, is found on many breast and other tumors, making it a seemingly good target. But it is also found in tiny amounts in the lungs. When Dr. Rosenberg\u2019s team infused killer T-cells aimed at HER2 into a patient, she went into respiratory distress within 15 minutes and died five days later.The treatments work for the blood cancers because there is a good target. But finding these for the most common cancers has been difficult.One problem is that CARs, because of how they are made, can bind only to proteins on the surface of cancer cells. But most proteins made by these cells, or by any cell for that matter, are inside the cell, out of reach.There is an alternative approach that is gaining interest. Patients\u2019 immune cells can be engineered to make what are called T-cell receptors, or TCRs. These can recognize proteins inside the cancer cells.Some experts say TCRs, which have a far wider array of potential targets, represent the best hope of using cell therapy to treat solid tumors. There have been hints of effectiveness already in treating one of those, a type of sarcoma.It might turn out that the best target for each patient will be unique to that person. Scientists are now experimenting with using DNA sequencing and other techniques to find the best mutated protein in each person\u2019s tumor at which to aim the claw.\u201cThink of how dauntingly personalized this is,\u201d Dr. Rosenberg said. \u201cWe are using their own cells to treat a unique mutation in their own tumor.\u201dHe said this approach might allow cell therapy to be used for most patients.Many other improvements are on the runway.Dr. Sadelain and Juno are working on \u201carmored CARs\u201d that not only bind to the target but produce immune-stimulating chemicals. Cellectis, a French company, has treated two babies with an off-the-shelf CAR treatment that does not require each patient\u2019s cells to be processed. Bellicum Pharmaceuticals is working on genetic switches that dim or shut off the CAR if the treatment is endangering the patient.\u201cWe\u2019re in the Model T version of the CAR now,\u201d said Dr. Levine, now the director of the cell production facility at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cWhat\u2019s coming along are Google CARs and Tesla CARs.\u201dIn February, the Novartis-Penn Center for Advanced Cellular Therapeutics opened on the ninth floor of a Penn medical building, paid for mainly by $20 million from Novartis. It has gleaming new laboratory space, clean rooms with the capacity to manufacture therapy for 400 patients a year, and a great view of downtown Philadelphia. On the wall are photographs of patients with success stories, like Doug Olson running a half-marathon and, of course, Emily Whitehead.Dr. June, who remarried and had two more children, now jets off regularly to attend conferences and give talks. A world map hanging outside his office is titled \u201cWhere in the World Is Carl June?\u201d It has pins stuck in every location he has been, and a picture of him on a bicycle pinned to his location at the moment.In the last two years he has visited more than 150 cities in more than 20 countries. This year alone he has accumulated more than 200,000 airline miles. Despite that schedule, he runs ultramarathons and participated in July in the Death Ride, a grueling bicycle race in California.Dr. Rosenberg still arrives at the National Cancer Institute nearly seven days a week. The walls outside his office are covered with signed photographs of the hundreds of fellows who have trained under him, many of them now leaders in immunotherapy. Every five years, they gather for a reunion, to reminisce and honor their mentor.Arie Belldegrun, who was a fellow in the 1980s, now runs Kite, the company commercializing the National Cancer Institute\u2019s CAR technology. He recounted what happened when he tried to get Dr. Rosenberg to join the company.\u201cHe sits quietly, quietly, quietly, and then he asks, \u2018Arie, why don\u2019t you ask me what I want to do?\u2019\u201cHe said: \u2018Every day that I go to work, I\u2019m as excited as a kid coming to a new place for the first time. If you ask me what I want to do, I want to die on this desk one day.\u2019\u201dBut not before he conquers cancer.\u201cI want to end this holocaust,\u201d Dr. Rosenberg said in the interview. \u201cI think I\u2019m finally getting the hang of what it will take to widely apply this to cancers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ford Promises Fleets of Driverless Cars Within Five Years", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "Supported byIn the race to develop driverless cars, several automakers and technology companies are already testing vehicles that pilot themselves on public roads. And others have outlined plans to expand their development fleets over the next few years.But few have gone so far as to give a definitive date for the commercial debut of these cars of the future.Now Ford Motor has done just that.At a news conference on Tuesday at the company\u2019s research center in Palo Alto, Calif., Mark Fields, Ford\u2019s chief executive, said the company planned to mass produce driverless cars and have them in commercial operation in a ride-hailing service by 2021.Beyond that, Mr. Fields\u2019s announcement was short on specifics. But he said that the vehicles Ford envisioned would be radically different from those that populate American roads now.\u201cThat means there\u2019s going to be no steering wheel. There\u2019s going to be no gas pedal. There\u2019s going to be no brake pedal,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cIf someone had told you 10 years ago, or even five years ago, that the C.E.O. of a major automaker American car company is going to be announcing the mass production of fully autonomous vehicles, they would have been called crazy or nuts or both.\u201dThe company also said on Tuesday that as part of the effort, it planned to expand its Palo Alto center, doubling the number of employees who work there over the next year, from the current 130.Ford also said it had acquired an Israeli start-up, Saips, that specializes in computer vision, a crucial technology for self-driving cars. And the automaker announced investments in three other companies involved in major technologies for driverless vehicles.For several years, automakers have understood that their industry is being reshaped by the use of advanced computer chips, software and sensors to develop cars designed to drive themselves. The tech companies Google and Apple have emerged as potential future competitors to automakers, while Tesla Motors has already proved a competitive threat to luxury brands like BMW and Mercedes-Benz with driver-assistance and collision-avoidance technologies.More recently, ride-sharing service providers like Uber have raised the competitive concerns of the conventional auto industry. The ride-hailing services aim to operate fleets of driverless cars that, in the future, might provide ready transportation to anyone, making it easier for people to get around without owning a car or even having a driver\u2019s license.A Barclays analyst, Brian Johnson, recently predicted that once autonomous vehicles are in widespread use, auto sales could fall as much as 40 percent as people rely on such services for transportation and choose not to own cars.Mr. Fields said on Tuesday that the combination of driverless cars and ride-sharing services represented a \u201cseismic shift\u201d for the auto industry that would be greater than the advent of the moving production line was roughly a century ago.\u201cThe world is changing, and it\u2019s changing rapidly,\u201d he said, adding that Ford now sees itself as not just a carmaker but a \u201cmobility company.\u201dBMW and Mercedes-Benz are among the carmakers that have seized upon the concept of \u201ctransportation as a service,\u201d as it is called, by starting ride-sharing services of their own.

{"Headline": "Ford Promises Fleets of Driverless Cars Within Five Years", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the race to develop driverless cars, several automakers and technology companies are already testing vehicles that pilot themselves on public roads. And others have outlined plans to expand their development fleets over the next few years.But few have gone so far as to give a definitive date for the commercial debut of these cars of the future.Now Ford Motor has done just that.At a news conference on Tuesday at the company\u2019s research center in Palo Alto, Calif., Mark Fields, Ford\u2019s chief executive, said the company planned to mass produce driverless cars and have them in commercial operation in a ride-hailing service by 2021.Beyond that, Mr. Fields\u2019s announcement was short on specifics. But he said that the vehicles Ford envisioned would be radically different from those that populate American roads now.\u201cThat means there\u2019s going to be no steering wheel. There\u2019s going to be no gas pedal. There\u2019s going to be no brake pedal,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cIf someone had told you 10 years ago, or even five years ago, that the C.E.O. of a major automaker American car company is going to be announcing the mass production of fully autonomous vehicles, they would have been called crazy or nuts or both.\u201dThe company also said on Tuesday that as part of the effort, it planned to expand its Palo Alto center, doubling the number of employees who work there over the next year, from the current 130.Ford also said it had acquired an Israeli start-up, Saips, that specializes in computer vision, a crucial technology for self-driving cars. And the automaker announced investments in three other companies involved in major technologies for driverless vehicles.For several years, automakers have understood that their industry is being reshaped by the use of advanced computer chips, software and sensors to develop cars designed to drive themselves. The tech companies Google and Apple have emerged as potential future competitors to automakers, while Tesla Motors has already proved a competitive threat to luxury brands like BMW and Mercedes-Benz with driver-assistance and collision-avoidance technologies.More recently, ride-sharing service providers like Uber have raised the competitive concerns of the conventional auto industry. The ride-hailing services aim to operate fleets of driverless cars that, in the future, might provide ready transportation to anyone, making it easier for people to get around without owning a car or even having a driver\u2019s license.A Barclays analyst, Brian Johnson, recently predicted that once autonomous vehicles are in widespread use, auto sales could fall as much as 40 percent as people rely on such services for transportation and choose not to own cars.Mr. Fields said on Tuesday that the combination of driverless cars and ride-sharing services represented a \u201cseismic shift\u201d for the auto industry that would be greater than the advent of the moving production line was roughly a century ago.\u201cThe world is changing, and it\u2019s changing rapidly,\u201d he said, adding that Ford now sees itself as not just a carmaker but a \u201cmobility company.\u201dBMW and Mercedes-Benz are among the carmakers that have seized upon the concept of \u201ctransportation as a service,\u201d as it is called, by starting ride-sharing services of their own. General Motors has teamed up with, and bought a stake in, Lyft, the main rival of Uber.GM and Lyft plan to have driverless vehicles operating in tests within a year.

{"Headline": "In Tesla and SolarCity Deal, a Glimpse of Musk\u2019s Clean-Energy Aspirations", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "Supported byIn the face of questions about debt, widening losses, governance and strategic logic, Tesla Motors and SolarCity announced a $2.6 billion stock merger on Monday.Now, it is up to Elon Musk to persuade the shareholders of the two companies \u2014 he founded both \u2014 that the deal makes sense. The transaction requires the approval this year of a majority of shareholders from both Tesla and SolarCity, excluding Mr. Musk and other insiders.Completion of the deal may come down to whether enough investors have the patience to accept the near-term headaches while waiting for Mr. Musk\u2019s long-term vision.His idea is that Tesla\u2019s batteries could store the power that SolarCity\u2019s panels have harnessed, a bet on the increasing use of solar energy. Most analysts, though, say this vision could take years, maybe even decades, to play out on a large scale \u2014 often longer than many investors tend to wait.\u201cI don\u2019t know why people would be voting in favor of it,\u201d said Efraim Levy, chief automotive analyst at Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Market Intelligence. \u201cThe valuation is excessive given the current prospects and the time horizon we\u2019re looking at.\u201dBut Mr. Musk, who also founded a third company with the hope of sending humans to Mars one day, is known for his visionary zeal. By doing this deal, he sees Tesla eventually moving beyond autos to become more of a clean-energy company that also happens to sell cars.\u201cThis is really all part of solving the sustainable-energy problem,\u201d Mr. Musk said in a conference call with analysts on Monday. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re all doing this \u2014 is to try to accelerate the advent of a sustainable-energy world.\u201dFrom Zip2 to OpenAI, a look at the entrepreneur\u2019s many companies.The stocks traded on Monday as if most investors expected the deal would get done. Under the terms of the deal, SolarCity shareholders will receive 0.11 Tesla shares for each SolarCity share they own. That represents $25.30 per SolarCity share, or about 58 cents under where the shares ended trading on Monday.Subsequently, independent members of the Tesla and SolarCity boards conducted due diligence and consulted with financial and legal advisers to arrive at the agreed-upon price.Tesla, which will report its second-quarter earnings on Wednesday, is going through a major transition as a car company. It is expanding its assembly plant in California, in hopes of beginning to fill the more than 300,000 preorders for its coming Model 3 sedan by next year. To speed the process, Mr. Musk has overhauled his manufacturing team, bringing in new executives from rival automakers such as Audi.Tesla is also facing more pressure from federal regulators and Congress about its Autopilot assisted-driving system, which was operational in a Model S that crashed into the side of a tractor-trailer in Florida on May 7. The driver, Joshua Brown, was killed in the accident \u2014 the first known fatality in a vehicle being driven by computer technology.Tesla has until late August to respond to a set of detailed questions from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration about the accident, as well any others involving the Autopilot system, which includes assisted steering, adaptive cruise control, collision avoidance and emergency braking.The National Transportation Safety Board and the Senate Commerce Committee are also investigating the incident.The safety investigations may not directly affect the approval process for the proposed merger. But they could be seen as setbacks in Tesla\u2019s grand expansion strategy, and a distraction for Mr. Musk as he tries to win over investors.Monday\u2019s deal includes a so-called go-shop period, which enables SolarCity to continue soliciting proposals from other parties until Sept. 14.The two companies plan to cut about $150 million in costs through the transaction in the first full year after the deal closes. They expect customers to benefit through lower hardware and installation costs, and they plan to use Tesla\u2019s 190 stores to expand SolarCity\u2019s reach.Through Tesla\u2019s stores, SolarCity would get easier, cheaper access to millions of customers; SolarCity has struggled to reduce its customer acquisition costs. In addition, it could benefit from the carmaker\u2019s expertise in manufacturing, just as SolarCity prepares to produce its own solar panels at a heavily subsidized factory in Buffalo.Mr. Rive, of SolarCity, said in the conference call that he expected almost all solar systems to include battery storage within three to five years, and that the combined company would be able to prosper by providing those systems, along with energy services for the grid. Adding rooftop solar to the overall energy mix, Mr. Musk said, would allow utility companies to avoid building new substations and transmission lines as the rising use of electric vehicles and heating systems increases demand for power.The merger, he said, would help Tesla take better advantage of all the customers it attracts to its stores by offering them more products. Making the solar systems appealing, he said, was important.Although some investors have expressed support for the deal, many analysts and investors have continued to question whether it makes sense for the carmaker to take on SolarCity, which has piled on debt as it seeks to continue its aggressive expansion. Last month, SolarCity said it had raised $345 million in tax-equity financing and added $110 million to a loan agreement, bringing its total to $760 million.And on Monday, SolarCity reduced projections for residential system installations for 2016 by nearly 10 percent because the pace of installations had been slower than expected in the first half of the year.Many analysts are still optimistic that, despite the risks, the deal will ultimately get done.\u201cEverything about Elon is for the long term,\u201d said David Whiston, an analyst with Morningstar. \u201cI suspect the big, institutional shareholders understand that and they\u2019re all in on Elon, and I expect the large shareholders will vote yes for the deal.\u201dDiane Cardwell contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Delphi and Mobileye to Produce System for Self-Driving Cars", "Date": "2016-08-23", "News": "Supported byThe race to build self-driving cars is becoming an increasingly crowded field.And then there are suppliers, like Delphi Automotive and Mobileye, that intend to develop turnkey self-driving systems that automakers could build into their vehicles.Delphi, formed out of the former parts division of General Motors, and Mobileye, a rising Israeli company known for producing the sensors and other technology that help cars recognize obstacles in the road, said on Tuesday that they had formed a partnership to provide self-driving components to automakers by the end of 2019.Mobileye and Delphi said they expected to demonstrate an early version of their system in January at the 2017 International CES, the annual consumer electronics show, in Las Vegas and to begin production of a commercial version within two years.Mobileye is already a vendor of computer-vision technology and other related systems to carmakers. For Delphi, the partnership is an extension of its other efforts to develop self-driving cars, including a project with the government of Singapore to field a test fleet of driverless taxis. In 2015, a driverless car built by Delphi completed a 3,400-mile trip from San Francisco to New York in nine days.The Mobileye-Delphi collaboration \u201cwill accelerate the time to market\u201d and enable carmakers to produce vehicles capable of driving themselves \u201cwithout the need for huge capital investments,\u201d Amnon Shashua, chairman and chief technology officer of Mobileye, said on Tuesday in a conference call with reporters.Delphi\u2019s chief executive, Kevin Clark, added, \u201cWe believe this reshapes the automated driving landscape.\u201dNot so long ago, it seemed that Google and, separately, the electric carmaker Tesla Motors had clear leads over the traditional auto industry in developing technology for autonomous vehicles.Google has been testing its self-driving cars for a few years. Tesla grabbed the spotlight for a time after introducing its Autopilot feature last fall, although a fatal accident in May of a driver using the system has made clear that Autopilot is still far from being a self-driving car technology.But efforts to create self-driving cars are evolving so rapidly that traditional carmakers see an opening.Ford said last week that it would have a fully autonomous vehicle \u2014 with no steering wheels or pedals \u2014 operating in a ride-hailing service like Uber within five years. It expects to have 30 self-driving test cars on public roads by the end of this year and up to 90 by the end of 2017.The conventional car companies, with millions of vehicles already on the road, are trying to create a transition from driver-assistance and collision-avoidance systems already in their most advanced vehicles to a future of fully self-driving vehicles.BMW in July said it was partnering with Mobileye and Intel, the chip maker, in plans to offer a self-driving model by 2021.G.M. and Audi expect to offer enhanced cruise control and collision-avoidance systems in some 2018 models that they say will be the equals of, or more capable than, Tesla\u2019s Autopilot.Tesla\u2019s position is also uncertain because of the fatal crash in which Autopilot failed to recognize a truck crossing a road. Since news of that crash emerged, the company has emphasized that Autopilot is not intended to be a fully autonomous system and that drivers must keep their hands on the steering wheel and eyes on the road while using it, although YouTube videos show that some drivers do not follow the company\u2019s instructions.Autopilot uses Mobileye\u2019s sensor and processing technology. But the companies have recently parted ways. In a conference call, Mr. Shashua said Mobileye was unhappy with the way Tesla was using its technology.Not all carmakers predict that self-driving cars will proliferate rapidly. Honda Motor argues that more advanced technology is needed beyond the cameras and radar systems that are in use for the current driver-assist and collision-prevention systems, said Jim Keller, chief engineer at Honda\u2019s research center in Southfield, Mich.\u201cSensing technology is getting better and better, but it\u2019s not perfect,\u201d he said. Honda also says it believes cars need vehicle-to-vehicle, or V2V, communication devices that allow them to transmit their position and speed to other vehicles.\u201cRadar or a camera can only see what it can see,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what\u2019s around the corner or behind a building? You need V2V for that.\u201dDelphi, in the partnership with Mobileye, plans to provide automated driving software it has developed, as well as technology that uses cameras, radar and lidar, a type of radar based on laser beams. Delphi\u2019s current radar and sensing technology is used by many automakers for collision-avoidance, lane keeping, cruise control and automatic braking systems.The system the partners produce is intended to go first into automobiles that have steering wheels and gas and brake pedals, and it will be meant to assist, rather than replace, drivers.But the aim is to adapt those systems for fully self-driving cars.Mr. Shashua said the companies were relying on advances in sensing and \u201ca new class of machine intelligence\u201d to be successful. Fully autonomous vehicles \u201cneed sensing capable of recognizing moving objects and merging into traffic in a way that mimics human behavior,\u201d he said.Mr. Clark, the Delphi chief, said the companies would spend \u201chundreds of millions of dollars\u201d on the partnership without giving a more precise estimate.Mr. Shashua added that Mobileye\u2019s work with Delphi would complement the collaboration his company announced this summer with BMW and Intel.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Aims for an Edge in the Race for a Self-Driving Future", "Date": "2016-08-18", "News": "Supported byA world in which cars drive themselves may come sooner than once thought.On Thursday, Uber said that it would begin testing self-driving cars in Pittsburgh in a matter of weeks, allowing people in the city to hail modified versions of Volvo sport utility vehicles to get around the city.Uber also said it had acquired Otto, a 90-person start-up including former Google and Carnegie Mellon engineers that is focused on developing self-driving truck technology to upend the shipping industry.Those moves are the most recent indications of Uber\u2019s ambitions for autonomous vehicles that can provide services to both consumers and businesses.Suddenly, it seems, both Silicon Valley and Detroit are doubling down on their bets for autonomous vehicles. And in what could emerge as a self-driving-car arms race, the players are investing in, or partnering with, or buying outright the specialty companies most focused on the requisite hardware, software and artificial intelligence capabilities.Despite their multitude of sensors and processors, autonomous cars have a lot of trouble with some everyday aspects of driving.\u201cIt appears 2016 will go down in history as the year of the autonomous vehicle partnership,\u201d said Karl Brauer, an analyst with the auto research firm Kelley Blue Book.But the Ford and Uber initiatives are not without risk. Federal auto safety regulators are preparing guidelines for autonomous vehicles that may or may not include the need for a steering wheel or require the presence of a driver who can step in should computerized systems falter.In a nod to the highly experimental nature of its Pittsburgh plan, Uber intends to have an actual human being behind the wheel \u2014 just in case. But while Ford is looking five years out, Uber is moving aggressively toward driverless fleets, despite the regulatory uncertainties.\u201cThere\u2019s an urgency to our mission about being part of the future,\u201d Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s chief executive, said on Thursday in an interview. \u201cThis is not a side project. This is existential for us.\u201dThat explains Uber\u2019s other announcement on Thursday \u2014 its deal to buy Otto for undisclosed terms, to beef up its own in-house expertise in self-driving technology.The acquisition of Otto follows Uber\u2019s recent opening of an advanced technology center in Pittsburgh, in conjunction with Carnegie Mellon University. The company has also hired engineers directly away from Google, which has been immersed in developing autonomous cars for a decade.Like Uber, Google is intent on developing self-driving cars for urban taxi use \u2014 reasoning that the slow speeds and relatively predictable environment of city streets that can be thoroughly, digitally mapped is the best and safest near-term purpose of autonomous vehicles. But for Uber, such cars are not a side bet but a way to be more fully in control of its business by eliminating the need for drivers who expect to be paid.\u201cUber arguably has more at stake in creating self-driving cars than any other automotive entity,\u201d Mr. Brauer said.Although the market for big sales of fully self-driving cars is still years away, the investment and research activities are on a fast track.Uber plans to open a 180,000-square-foot facility in Palo Alto, Calif., to house Otto, which will operate as a stand-alone company focused specifically on upending the long-distance trucking industry. Otto engineers will also work out of offices in San Francisco and Pittsburgh.But that talent and technology will apply more broadly to the technology behind Uber\u2019s grander self-driving car efforts, Mr. Kalanick said. He said he believed that his company\u2019s approach \u2014 a combination of teaming up with hardware manufacturers, Otto\u2019s software expertise and a large network of more than 50 million monthly riders as recently as July \u2014 places Uber in the best position to be competitive with companies like Google.\u201cThe first company in the space is not always the winner,\u201d Anthony Levandowski, chief executive of Otto, said on Thursday. \u201cIntel was not the first chip maker. Facebook wasn\u2019t the first social network.\u201dThe self-driving revolution has already hit a few speed bumps, in vehicles that are not fully autonomous but employ some elements of the technology. The electric-car maker Tesla is under investigation by federal regulators looking into a fatal crash in May of a Tesla Model S sedan whose driver had the vehicle\u2019s Autopilot assisted-driving system engaged.After Joshua Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio, was killed driving a Tesla Model S in the first fatality involving a self-driving car, questions have arisen about the safety of the car\u2019s technology.The German automaker Daimler was forced recently to pull an advertisement in the United States that possibly overstated the safety of assisted-driving options in a new Mercedes-Benz model.And Google is continuously explaining how minor accidents are occurring in self-driving vehicles it has been testing for some time in California.But potential safety concerns have hardly slowed the pace of research and investment by G.M., Ford and others. In Uber\u2019s case, Mr. Kalanick said he was confident that government officials would approve self-driving vehicles once the industry proves their effectiveness in real-world conditions.\u201cRegulators are going to optimistically make it work, while making it safer for the whole community,\u201d he said.In the Pittsburgh pilot program, Uber plans not only to have human drivers aboard as a safety precaution. Passengers who use the vehicles will have to \u201copt in\u201d and agree to be participants in the road test before riding, according to Uber.G.M. and Lyft are also planning their own testing program for autonomous ride-hailing vehicles, although they have not disclosed details.That plan, along with this week\u2019s announcements by Uber and Ford make clear that the initial market for robotic cars will likely be for commercial fleets rather than vehicles consumers would park in their own garages.Industry analysts see ride-hailing firms and delivery businesses as natural customers for the first autonomous vehicles, in part because the cars and trucks are expected to carry high price tags.Ford officials said this week that ride-hailing services are able to generate the passenger revenues needed to cover the high cost of the cars.Raj Nair, Ford\u2019s global product development chief, said that eliminating human drivers would drastically lower the cost of a ride-hailing fare. By catering to those companies, Ford expects to build a small, but profitable business segment.Ford has not said how many self-driving vehicles it expects to produce on an annual basis, or whether it would adapt one of its current models or build an entirely new vehicle.But the company\u2019s chief executive, Mark Fields, pledged that the vehicles would \u201cbring mobility to millions of people\u201d who do not own cars themselves. And doing so will create a \u201cvery good business\u201d for Ford.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Everyone Despises SolarCity Deal, Except Tesla Shareholders", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseCorporate governance experts are up in arms, because Tesla\u2019s visionary founder, the entrepreneur Elon Musk, also founded SolarCity and is the largest shareholder in both companies. SolarCity\u2019s chief executive is Mr. Musk\u2019s cousin. There are overlapping directors. Critics called it blatant self-dealing and accused Mr. Musk of using valuable Tesla shares to bail out a struggling SolarCity.James S. Chanos \u2014 an investor who, it should be noted, is betting against both stocks \u2014 called it a \u201cshameful example of corporate governance at its worst.\u201dBut what if the critics are wrong?Many auto industry experts also said the idea of combining Tesla, an electric-car manufacturer, with SolarCity, which makes solar energy panels, makes no strategic sense. Even if energy generation, storage and an auto powertrain are a seamless product, so-called vertical integration, in which one manufacturer makes all the components, was the old Henry Ford model and later, General Motors\u2019. That approach has gone down in automotive history as a colossal failure.Adam Jonas, the influential auto industry analyst at Morgan Stanley, slashed his price target for Tesla and wrote in a note to clients that potential rewards would not adequately compensate investors for the greater risks and cash flow drain. Expanding into a non-auto business like solar energy exposes Tesla to \u201cuntested cost, competitive and regulatory forces,\u201d he warned.Perhaps the harshest verdict came from the market itself: Tesla shares dropped more than 10 percent the day the deal was announced.Mr. Musk \u201cwent overnight from being a genius to an idiot,\u201d said Joseph Dennison, portfolio manager at Zevenbergen Capital Investments, a large Tesla shareholder.Largely overlooked in the din, however, is that few, if any, of Tesla\u2019s harshest critics are Tesla\u2019s current shareholders. And they are the only ones who truly matter, because they\u2019ll have a vote on the deal and it\u2019s their money on the line.Tesla\u2019s four biggest shareholders after Mr. Musk are mutual fund managers, including the industry giants Fidelity, Vanguard and T. Rowe Price. None have announced how they\u2019ll vote, but they have a history of supporting management generally, and specifically Mr. Musk.Even before the deal was announced, a Fidelity portfolio manager, Gavin Baker, told investors, \u201cWe are fans not just of Tesla products but of the concepts underpinning the firm and potential future partnerships ahead of it.\u201dRonald Baron, founder of Baron Capital, which owns 1.5 million Tesla shares, said his initial reaction was, \u201cWhy on earth would anyone want to do this? Can\u2019t you buy these panels much cheaper in China?\u201dHe said he had looked into investing in SolarCity several times, and each time decided to pass (a wise decision considering that SolarCity shares have fallen more than 50 percent this year.)But after further research and discussions with Tesla management, Mr. Baron told me his concerns had been largely assuaged. \u201cUntil I read the proxy, I can\u2019t tell you how I\u2019m going to vote,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the more we researched this, the more sense it made to combine Tesla with solar panels. We believe they can make better products, make them more efficiently, and realize tremendous savings by selling the two products together.\u201dOther investors have also been reconsidering the merits of the deal. Tesla shares have more than recovered what they lost after the deal was announced. And investors brushed off an announcement on Wednesday of worse-than-expected quarterly losses, focusing instead on higher vehicle production and new orders.Tesla tried to do its best to allay concerns about Mr. Musk\u2019s conflict of interest. Mr. Musk will not vote, nor will other insiders who own shares in both companies, a step that was not mandated by law.Tesla maintains that various committees of directors that it says are independent vigorously negotiated terms of the deal, and that Mr. Musk did not know the price before it was agreed on. When the deal became final on Monday, the price was slightly lower than that announced in June, suggesting some genuine haggling went on.But realistically, Mr. Musk\u2019s dominant role in both companies means that \u201cit\u2019s an intractable problem,\u201d said Charles M. Elson, an expert in corporate governance at the University of Delaware. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to resolve this. The only way would be not to do it.\u201dTesla says that would elevate corporate governance purity at the expense of common sense. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to take every appropriate step\u201d to minimize the conflict issues, Todd A. Maron, Tesla\u2019s general counsel, told me this week. \u201cBut if there are synergies, which there are, and we can make the best product under one company\u2019s ownership, and we can persuade the independent shareholders to support the deal, there shouldn\u2019t be a strict prohibition just because someone is on both sides.\u201dMr. Dennison of Zevenbergen Capital said that focusing on conflicts \u201cis missing the bigger picture.\u201d\u201cTo make these future products as good, integrated and efficient as possible,\u201d he added, \u201cyou need the two companies working together.\u201d He said his firm had not announced how it would vote, but he has typically sided with management.From Zip2 to OpenAI, a look at the entrepreneur\u2019s many companies.As for making its own batteries and solar panels and being vertically integrated, Tesla maintains it had little choice. \u201cTesla does not believe in vertical integration as an objective in and of itself,\u201d Mr. Maron said, but \u201cgoes down that path because there\u2019s no better option.\u201d Tesla has said its planned auto production volume would consume \u201ctoday\u2019s entire worldwide production of lithium ion batteries.\u201d\u201cCreate a smoothly integrated and beautiful solar-roof-with-battery product that just works, empowering the individual as their own utility, and then scale that throughout the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t do this well if Tesla and SolarCity are different companies, which is why we need to combine and break down the barriers inherent to being separate companies.\u201dAdmittedly, that\u2019s a long-term vision that has little to do with the latest quarterly earnings. If Tesla owners were plugging their cars into outlets with electricity from coal-fired power plants, there would not be much sustainability to get excited about.\u201cMusk\u2019s vision from Day 1 10 years ago was to accelerate sustainable energy, \u201c said Mr. Dennison. \u201cThat\u2019s a much bigger vision than building cars.\u201dAnd vision is what Tesla\u2019s shareholders are buying into, just as Amazon investors put their faith in Jeff Bezos. That\u2019s why, for all the controversy, the SolarCity deal will almost surely be approved by Tesla shareholders.\u201cIf you\u2019re investing in a Musk business, you\u2019re investing in something that hasn\u2019t happened yet, so it\u2019s risky,\u201d said Mr. Baron. \u201cBut I love the guy. He\u2019s totally focused.

Turkish stocks and bonds have been rising, in spite of the country\u2019s debt being downgraded. It seems a 10-year bond offering a 9 percent reward is too tempting to turn down, even if the inflation rate is 8.7 percent and the currency is heading south.And its expansion plans cannot mask the challenges it faces in turning its innovations into mass productions and serious revenue. The company has to satisfy more than 300,000 preorders for its cheaper Model 3 sedan and meet its production targets while contending with heightened scrutiny from federal auto safety regulators and the Securities and Exchange Commission.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Aims for an Edge in the Race for a Self-Driving Future", "Date": "2016-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA world in which cars drive themselves may come sooner than once thought.On Thursday, Uber said that it would begin testing self-driving cars in Pittsburgh in a matter of weeks, allowing people in the city to hail modified versions of Volvo sport utility vehicles to get around the city.Uber also said it had acquired Otto, a 90-person start-up including former Google and Carnegie Mellon engineers that is focused on developing self-driving truck technology to upend the shipping industry.Those moves are the most recent indications of Uber\u2019s ambitions for autonomous vehicles that can provide services to both consumers and businesses.Suddenly, it seems, both Silicon Valley and Detroit are doubling down on their bets for autonomous vehicles. And in what could emerge as a self-driving-car arms race, the players are investing in, or partnering with, or buying outright the specialty companies most focused on the requisite hardware, software and artificial intelligence capabilities.Despite their multitude of sensors and processors, autonomous cars have a lot of trouble with some everyday aspects of driving.\u201cIt appears 2016 will go down in history as the year of the autonomous vehicle partnership,\u201d said Karl Brauer, an analyst with the auto research firm Kelley Blue Book.But the Ford and Uber initiatives are not without risk. Federal auto safety regulators are preparing guidelines for autonomous vehicles that may or may not include the need for a steering wheel or require the presence of a driver who can step in should computerized systems falter.In a nod to the highly experimental nature of its Pittsburgh plan, Uber intends to have an actual human being behind the wheel \u2014 just in case. But while Ford is looking five years out, Uber is moving aggressively toward driverless fleets, despite the regulatory uncertainties.\u201cThere\u2019s an urgency to our mission about being part of the future,\u201d Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s chief executive, said on Thursday in an interview. \u201cThis is not a side project. This is existential for us.\u201dThat explains Uber\u2019s other announcement on Thursday \u2014 its deal to buy Otto for undisclosed terms, to beef up its own in-house expertise in self-driving technology.The acquisition of Otto follows Uber\u2019s recent opening of an advanced technology center in Pittsburgh, in conjunction with Carnegie Mellon University. The company has also hired engineers directly away from Google, which has been immersed in developing autonomous cars for a decade.Like Uber, Google is intent on developing self-driving cars for urban taxi use \u2014 reasoning that the slow speeds and relatively predictable environment of city streets that can be thoroughly, digitally mapped is the best and safest near-term purpose of autonomous vehicles. But for Uber, such cars are not a side bet but a way to be more fully in control of its business by eliminating the need for drivers who expect to be paid.\u201cUber arguably has more at stake in creating self-driving cars than any other automotive entity,\u201d Mr. Brauer said.Although the market for big sales of fully self-driving cars is still years away, the investment and research activities are on a fast track.Uber plans to open a 180,000-square-foot facility in Palo Alto, Calif., to house Otto, which will operate as a stand-alone company focused specifically on upending the long-distance trucking industry. Otto engineers will also work out of offices in San Francisco and Pittsburgh.But that talent and technology will apply more broadly to the technology behind Uber\u2019s grander self-driving car efforts, Mr. Kalanick said. He said he believed that his company\u2019s approach \u2014 a combination of teaming up with hardware manufacturers, Otto\u2019s software expertise and a large network of more than 50 million monthly riders as recently as July \u2014 places Uber in the best position to be competitive with companies like Google.\u201cThe first company in the space is not always the winner,\u201d Anthony Levandowski, chief executive of Otto, said on Thursday. \u201cIntel was not the first chip maker. Facebook wasn\u2019t the first social network.\u201dThe self-driving revolution has already hit a few speed bumps, in vehicles that are not fully autonomous but employ some elements of the technology. The electric-car maker Tesla is under investigation by federal regulators looking into a fatal crash in May of a Tesla Model S sedan whose driver had the vehicle\u2019s Autopilot assisted-driving system engaged.After Joshua Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio, was killed driving a Tesla Model S in the first fatality involving a self-driving car, questions have arisen about the safety of the car\u2019s technology.The German automaker Daimler was forced recently to pull an advertisement in the United States that possibly overstated the safety of assisted-driving options in a new Mercedes-Benz model.And Google is continuously explaining how minor accidents are occurring in self-driving vehicles it has been testing for some time in California.But potential safety concerns have hardly slowed the pace of research and investment by G.M., Ford and others. In Uber\u2019s case, Mr. Kalanick said he was confident that government officials would approve self-driving vehicles once the industry proves their effectiveness in real-world conditions.\u201cRegulators are going to optimistically make it work, while making it safer for the whole community,\u201d he said.In the Pittsburgh pilot program, Uber plans not only to have human drivers aboard as a safety precaution. Passengers who use the vehicles will have to \u201copt in\u201d and agree to be participants in the road test before riding, according to Uber.G.M. and Lyft are also planning their own testing program for autonomous ride-hailing vehicles, although they have not disclosed details.That plan, along with this week\u2019s announcements by Uber and Ford make clear that the initial market for robotic cars will likely be for commercial fleets rather than vehicles consumers would park in their own garages.Industry analysts see ride-hailing firms and delivery businesses as natural customers for the first autonomous vehicles, in part because the cars and trucks are expected to carry high price tags.Ford officials said this week that ride-hailing services are able to generate the passenger revenues needed to cover the high cost of the cars.Raj Nair, Ford\u2019s global product development chief, said that eliminating human drivers would drastically lower the cost of a ride-hailing fare. By catering to those companies, Ford expects to build a small, but profitable business segment.Ford has not said how many self-driving vehicles it expects to produce on an annual basis, or whether it would adapt one of its current models or build an entirely new vehicle.But the company\u2019s chief executive, Mark Fields, pledged that the vehicles would \u201cbring mobility to millions of people\u201d who do not own cars themselves. And doing so will create a \u201cvery good business\u201d for Ford.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Producing Clean Power Turned Out to Be a Messy Business", "Date": "2016-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn the edge of a bucolic field in Princeton, N.J., an eco-friendly office building recently opened its doors. Plants festoon the roof, a living wall is planned for the lobby, and rainwater storage tanks supply the building\u2019s needs. In the parking lot there are wind turbines, solar panels and electric vehicle charging stations.It is the picture of a sustainable future, one in which society\u2019s insatiable demand for electricity can be met without polluting the planet.The same cannot be said of the building\u2019s tenant, NRG Energy.The biggest independent power producer in the country, NRG sells electricity to utilities, companies and individual homes. To generate all that wattage, it burns enormous amounts of natural gas, coal and oil, making NRG one of the country\u2019s biggest polluters.It isn\u2019t trying to muck up the planet; that\u2019s just the nature of the business NRG is in. The electricity industry is the biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. In 2014, NRG was the fourth-largest emitter of carbon dioxide among the country\u2019s power producers.The business of providing Americans with electricity hasn\u2019t evolved much in a century. But today, growing concerns about climate change, affordable wind and solar power, and the potential for distributed generation are pressuring utilities and power producers like NRG to clean up their acts, and fast.\u201cOur industry is going though massive transformation, the likes of which we\u2019ve never seen,\u201d said Mauricio Gutierrez, the recently installed chief executive of NRG. \u201cThe industry has never seen this much turnover.\u201dAll this transformation has been particularly tumultuous for NRG, which has weathered more than its share of mishaps and unintended consequences: In May, for example, a fire knocked out a crucial tower at a cutting-edge but troubled solar power plant that the company manages in the Southern California desert. Its big bets on residential solar and on a national charging network for electric vehicles were ahead of their time and fizzled.The shale and fracking booms in the United States made natural gas cheap and abundant, pulling down the price of electricity and making power sources that NRG still depends on heavily \u2014 including coal, nuclear and renewables \u2014 less profitable. Investors lost faith in the company, NRG\u2019s stock plummeted, and its previous chief executive was summarily fired, replaced by Mr. Gutierrez.Far from emerging as an industry pioneer, NRG has become a cautionary tale. A power-hungry nation needs to change the way it is fueled, but as NRG shows, transitioning to clean power is messy business.\u201cThe power producers and utilities are the canaries in the coal mine,\u201d said Aron Cramer, C.E.O. of Business for Social Responsibility, a consulting firm. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a lot of road kill in the midst of this transition to a lower-carbon energy system.\u201dNo two companies face the exact same set of challenges. But at some level, the quandary preoccupying NRG is one that all power producers and utilities will ultimately face: how to make more electricity while emitting fewer greenhouse gases.NRG wasn\u2019t always a clean-energy proponent. Until recently, it was just another power producer, burning fossil fuels to electrify the grid.In 2003, it tapped David Crane to be its chief executive. Mr. Crane, who previously ran a traditional London-based power company, set about expanding NRG\u2019s core business. He acquired Reliant Energy, which sells electricity to homes and businesses in Texas, as well as GenOn Energy, a rival based in Houston. These moves vastly expanded NRG\u2019s scale, and its emissions.By 2006, Mr. Crane began to respond to the climate crisis and became one of the country\u2019s most unlikely environmentalists.At first, he made modest changes. NRG bought a wind power company, which it later sold. Soon, though, Mr. Crane made large investments in wind and solar plants and spent heavily on pet projects like a national network of electric-car charging stations.Seemingly overnight, the fossil fuels executive became a champion of renewable energy. He wanted to turn the hub-and-spoke utility model \u2014 with big power plants sending electricity out to homes and businesses \u2014 inside out.\u201cIt\u2019s the destiny of NRG to be a leader,\u201d Mr. Crane said at the groundbreaking of the new headquarters, \u201cto create a more sustainable and prosperous future while winning the fight against climate change.\u201dMr. Crane was channeling the spirit of the time. In December, world leaders in Paris pledged to combat climate change. The United States said it would cut its greenhouse gas emissions by more than a quarter in 10 years. With wind and solar power cheaper than ever and consumers starting to embrace energy-saving technologies, these targets could be within reach.But the climate crisis won\u2019t be solved with more Teslas alone. If the goals set in Paris are to be met, big electricity producers like NRG will need to reduce emissions while increasing power production. So Mr. Crane set about trying to retool NRG\u2019s fleet of dirty power plants while building a new generation of utility-scale wind and solar projects.NRG\u2019s dual personality \u2014 fossil fuel giant and clean energy pioneer \u2014 is on display at two relatively new facilities on opposite ends of the country.Just south of Los Angeles International Airport, four smokestacks punctuate the sandy coastline. There in one form or another since the 1950s, they are part of the El Segundo Energy Center, which produces enough electricity to power nearly 450,000 homes.At first glance, it is just another power plant burning cheap and abundant natural gas. Yet the El Segundo plant is among the most sophisticated of its kind. The two operational units, which came online in 2013, replaced inefficient relics constructed a half-century ago. Wastewater is recycled, emissions controls minimize the production of nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide, and a mix of combustion and steam turbines greatly enhance the amount of energy derived from the gas.And perhaps most critically, the El Segundo Energy Center is only occasionally generating power.A generation ago, it operated almost constantly, feeding the vast energy needs of Los Angeles. But over the last several years, big power companies \u2014 including NRG \u2014 have constructed enormous solar power plants in Southern California, supplying a growing share of daytime electricity.When the sun is shining, NRG\u2019s new high-tech gas-fired power plant is often dormant, coming alive only when demand ramps up and the sun has dimmed. In that sense, the El Segundo plant is a big leap forward. Yet the very need to pour millions of dollars into retrofitting this gas-fired plant on the picturesque shore of the Pacific Ocean shows just how much work has yet to be done.Across the country, in Spencer, Mass., NRG is putting the final touches on a community solar project on the grounds of St. Joseph\u2019s Abbey, a Trappist monastery. There, on rolling green hills near the monks\u2019 quarters, hundreds of hard-hatted workers are busy erecting thousands of solar panels.The electricity generated from those panels will flow through new transmission lines, which were required because the existing grid infrastructure could not handle the influx of solar energy. The project will power about 2,000 nearby homes, which should have lower and more reliable electricity bills.By NRG\u2019s standards, the solar plant is relatively small, but more are in the works. With enough such plants on the grid, they could help NRG achieve its ambitious emissions reductions targets.This is exactly the kind of change that Mr. Crane championed. And yet he is no longer the chief executive of NRG. He was abruptly fired in December, after NRG stock plummeted 63 percent in a year.Earnings fell as cheap natural gas made NRG\u2019s coal-fired plants less competitive, and investors had grown weary of Mr. Crane\u2019s focus on clean energy. Even as NRG\u2019s core business was losing money, Mr. Crane devoted much of his quarterly earnings calls to discussions about clean-power projects.\u201cWe all believe in renewables,\u201d said Shahriar Pourreza, an analyst with Guggenheim Partners. \u201cBut there was such a change in the message of the company that investors lost confidence in the management team.\u201dThe NRG board named the company\u2019s chief operating officer, Mr. Gutierrez, as the new leader. He had grown up in Mexico City, where electricity was sometimes spotty. Mr. Gutierrez joined his family\u2019s engineering company, then worked for Dynegy, a power producer in Houston, before joining NRG. Yet he says that like his predecessor, he is committed to environmental stewardship.\u201cWhen a spiritual leader like the pope calls out our moral responsibility toward the environment, it\u2019s a pretty big thing,\u201d Mr. Gutierrez said. \u201cIt transcends science and policy.\u201dHe was engaged in efforts to combat climate change well before Paris. As Mr. Crane\u2019s C.O.O., he led an NRG task force that recommended that the company adopt ambitious targets for emissions reduction. Mr. Gutierrez recently recommitted to those goals. \u201cRenewables is something that\u2019s very important for our portfolio,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s good business.\u201dMr. Gutierrez has a tricky balancing act. He must appease demanding investors and a skittish board, which most likely means reining in some of Mr. Crane\u2019s clean-energy ventures. Yet he must also fill the shoes of a chief executive who had raised hopes among environmentalists that a big energy producer was getting serious about climate change. He must profitably manage gas and coal assets \u2014 which still make up most of the company\u2019s power generation, sales and profits \u2014 while also preparing for a future that is more dependent on solar and wind.Analysts are pleased with Mr. Gutierrez\u2019s performance so far. He has simplified the corporate structure, played down some of Mr. Crane\u2019s side projects and focused on the balance sheet. NRG shares have risen 40 percent since Mr. Gutierrez took over.\u201cWith the old management, there was such a change in message, the company started to lose credibility,\u201d Mr. Pourreza said. \u201cMauricio is leading this company in the right direction.\u201dBut how NRG will actually achieve vast reductions in its carbon footprint is unclear. As long as it is burning so much gas and coal, it will remain a major emitter of greenhouse gases. And while Mr. Gutierrez speaks hopefully of developments in carbon-capture technology and utility-scale battery storage, practical solutions remain elusive. \u201cDo we have a perfect line of sight on how we\u2019re going to get there? No,\u201d he said. \u201cDo we have a road map? Yes.\u201dComplicating matters, the Obama administration\u2019s signature effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector \u2014 the Clean Power Plan \u2014 is tied up in the courts. (NRG was among the companies that petitioned the E.P.A. to modify the plan, arguing that it made the power sector too reliant on natural gas.) The ambiguous fate of that plan has added regulatory uncertainty to an industry already in flux.\u201cYou have these goals set in Paris, you have a framework for getting there through the Clean Power Plan, and you have the judicial branch saying stop,\u201d said Ralph Izzo, chief executive of Public Service Enterprise Group, a New Jersey utility. \u201cYou can\u2019t make economic decisions in that environment.\u201dEven NRG\u2019s big renewable projects \u2014 installations that are supposed to one day replace coal- and gas-fired plants \u2014 are mired in problems. In the Southern California desert, NRG oversees operations at Ivanpah, the world\u2019s largest solar thermal installation, where thousands of mirrors reflect the sun at enormous towers and water is converted to steam that powers turbines. NRG owns the plant along with BrightSource Energy and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.Heralded as a beacon of clean energy when it opened in 2014, Ivanpah has been continually troubled.From the outset, it produced less electricity than expected. Over the last few years, the cost of solar panels fell sharply, making Ivanpah\u2019s power comparatively expensive. In March, the consortium that owns the plant nearly defaulted on a contract with Pacific Gas & Electric, the Northern California utility.Then in May, a fire at the plant knocked out one of the towers, raising new questions about the project\u2019s viability. Last week, when NRG reported quarterly earnings, it said that revenue from its renewables businesses was down 14 percent to $57 million, largely the result of problems at Ivanpah.This isn\u2019t the first time that a big energy company has made ambitious plans to become a leader in green energy, only to be reined in. In 2000, BP introduced its \u201cBeyond Petroleum\u201d tagline and began investing heavily in renewable energy. It committed billions of dollars to wind and solar projects, and made investments in carbon capture and biofuels.After a decade of investment, BP largely backed off its renewables program. Most of its money was still coming from oil and gas, and the company set about selling its solar and wind power assets. They simply weren\u2019t profitable enough.\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to recall that 10 years ago BP was one of the darlings of the green movement,\u201d said Justin Adams, managing director of global lands for the Nature Conservancy and a former executive at BP working on renewables.\u201cThrough that period, some investors were interested, most were ambivalent at best and some downright skeptical at worst,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat on earth was BP doing, taking its eyes off its core business and tinkering around with renewables?\u201dAt NRG, Mr. Gutierrez has already backed away from residential solar and electric-vehicle charging projects that Mr. Crane held so dear. So far, however, there are no signs that NRG will completely reverse course. Mr. Gutierrez is still pushing community solar power, and NRG provides solar installations to big companies like Whole Foods. Last week, NRG spent nearly $200 million to acquire more solar and wind assets.Today, NRG generates about 9 percent of its electricity from renewable assets, up from less than 1 percent in 2008, and that figure is likely to grow. Across the industry, a majority of power plants being built today use renewables, not fossil fuels.\u201cThe sad moral of this story is that it\u2019s very hard to be a C.E.O. for tomorrow, when the markets only care about being a C.E.O. for today,\u201d said Mr. Cramer of Business for Social Responsibility. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone really questions his vision, but he wasn\u2019t given any opportunity to put it into action.\u201dMr. Gutierrez says he shares his predecessor\u2019s vision. By 2050, he envisions enormous batteries storing solar power generated during the day, allowing people to use it at night. Distributed energy will be more common, as Mr. Crane predicted. Carbon-capture technology will make the burning of fossil fuels much less environmentally destructive, Mr. Gutierrez hopes. Perhaps coal-fired power plants will be gone altogether.\u201cWe are a part of the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are also a big part of the solution.\u201dIt\u2019s an appealing vision of a green energy system, one that could fulfill the needs of an electricity-hungry world without spoiling the environment. But how NRG gets there \u2014 especially with investors and a board that seem intolerant of bold steps \u2014 remains vague at best.

{"Headline": "Delphi and Mobileye to Produce System for Self-Driving Cars", "Date": "2016-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe race to build self-driving cars is becoming an increasingly crowded field.And then there are suppliers, like Delphi Automotive and Mobileye, that intend to develop turnkey self-driving systems that automakers could build into their vehicles.Delphi, formed out of the former parts division of General Motors, and Mobileye, a rising Israeli company known for producing the sensors and other technology that help cars recognize obstacles in the road, said on Tuesday that they had formed a partnership to provide self-driving components to automakers by the end of 2019.Mobileye and Delphi said they expected to demonstrate an early version of their system in January at the 2017 International CES, the annual consumer electronics show, in Las Vegas and to begin production of a commercial version within two years.Mobileye is already a vendor of computer-vision technology and other related systems to carmakers. For Delphi, the partnership is an extension of its other efforts to develop self-driving cars, including a project with the government of Singapore to field a test fleet of driverless taxis. In 2015, a driverless car built by Delphi completed a 3,400-mile trip from San Francisco to New York in nine days.The Mobileye-Delphi collaboration \u201cwill accelerate the time to market\u201d and enable carmakers to produce vehicles capable of driving themselves \u201cwithout the need for huge capital investments,\u201d Amnon Shashua, chairman and chief technology officer of Mobileye, said on Tuesday in a conference call with reporters.Delphi\u2019s chief executive, Kevin Clark, added, \u201cWe believe this reshapes the automated driving landscape.\u201dNot so long ago, it seemed that Google and, separately, the electric carmaker Tesla Motors had clear leads over the traditional auto industry in developing technology for autonomous vehicles.Google has been testing its self-driving cars for a few years. Tesla grabbed the spotlight for a time after introducing its Autopilot feature last fall, although a fatal accident in May of a driver using the system has made clear that Autopilot is still far from being a self-driving car technology.But efforts to create self-driving cars are evolving so rapidly that traditional carmakers see an opening.Ford said last week that it would have a fully autonomous vehicle \u2014 with no steering wheels or pedals \u2014 operating in a ride-hailing service like Uber within five years. It expects to have 30 self-driving test cars on public roads by the end of this year and up to 90 by the end of 2017.The conventional car companies, with millions of vehicles already on the road, are trying to create a transition from driver-assistance and collision-avoidance systems already in their most advanced vehicles to a future of fully self-driving vehicles.BMW in July said it was partnering with Mobileye and Intel, the chip maker, in plans to offer a self-driving model by 2021.G.M. and Audi expect to offer enhanced cruise control and collision-avoidance systems in some 2018 models that they say will be the equals of, or more capable than, Tesla\u2019s Autopilot.Tesla\u2019s position is also uncertain because of the fatal crash in which Autopilot failed to recognize a truck crossing a road. Since news of that crash emerged, the company has emphasized that Autopilot is not intended to be a fully autonomous system and that drivers must keep their hands on the steering wheel and eyes on the road while using it, although YouTube videos show that some drivers do not follow the company\u2019s instructions.Autopilot uses Mobileye\u2019s sensor and processing technology. But the companies have recently parted ways. In a conference call, Mr. Shashua said Mobileye was unhappy with the way Tesla was using its technology.Not all carmakers predict that self-driving cars will proliferate rapidly. Honda Motor argues that more advanced technology is needed beyond the cameras and radar systems that are in use for the current driver-assist and collision-prevention systems, said Jim Keller, chief engineer at Honda\u2019s research center in Southfield, Mich.\u201cSensing technology is getting better and better, but it\u2019s not perfect,\u201d he said. Honda also says it believes cars need vehicle-to-vehicle, or V2V, communication devices that allow them to transmit their position and speed to other vehicles.\u201cRadar or a camera can only see what it can see,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what\u2019s around the corner or behind a building? You need V2V for that.\u201dDelphi, in the partnership with Mobileye, plans to provide automated driving software it has developed, as well as technology that uses cameras, radar and lidar, a type of radar based on laser beams. Delphi\u2019s current radar and sensing technology is used by many automakers for collision-avoidance, lane keeping, cruise control and automatic braking systems.The system the partners produce is intended to go first into automobiles that have steering wheels and gas and brake pedals, and it will be meant to assist, rather than replace, drivers.But the aim is to adapt those systems for fully self-driving cars.Mr. Shashua said the companies were relying on advances in sensing and \u201ca new class of machine intelligence\u201d to be successful. Fully autonomous vehicles \u201cneed sensing capable of recognizing moving objects and merging into traffic in a way that mimics human behavior,\u201d he said.Mr. Clark, the Delphi chief, said the companies would spend \u201chundreds of millions of dollars\u201d on the partnership without giving a more precise estimate.Mr. Shashua added that Mobileye\u2019s work with Delphi would complement the collaboration his company announced this summer with BMW and Intel.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Wet Blanket", "Date": "2016-08-19", "News": "Supported byWordplaySATURDAY PUZZLE \u2014 Thank goodness for fill-in-the-blank clues. On a Saturday, they can be life savers. Generally the easiest type of clue because your brain loves filling in missing information, even the fill-in-the-blanks are tougher on a Saturday, but they can also provide us with a much-needed toehold in an otherwise impenetrable puzzle. I got started in Mark Diehl\u2019s puzzle in just this way, filling in \u201cThe ODESSA File,\u201d Edmond DANTES, and ANSON Williams right off the bat.The best way to expand your territory from there is to look for clues that are in your wheelhouse, or that involve topics with which you are familiar. I haven\u2019t gotten around to reading it, but I knew that Nikola TESLA\u2019s biography is called \u201cLightning in His Hand,\u201d so in that went as well.Next, assume that almost everything will be misdirected in some way. Set your brain the task of unraveling these clues, and take nothing at face value. Even a clue like \u201cBacking for a cartoonist\u201d sounds like we\u2019re supposed to be thinking about financial backing, but we\u2019re not; the answer is ART BOARD. On Saturday, you may or may not see a question mark at the end of a clue.Dr. Diehl (he has a D.D.S.) debuts 11 entries today, and my favorite of these is SMOKY TOPAZ. Other entries that caught my eye were RUMBLE SEAT, GROANER and UP-TEMPO.\u2022 11A: A \u201cTall tale producer?\u201d can be a fibber, but it can also be IMAX, which produces movies that are shown on very big screens.\u2022 18A: If you\u2019re going to guess in a game of \u201cBattleship,\u201d it might as well be D-TEN, right? This was tough to get from the crossings, but I had X AND Y AXES, noted that the clue probably had to do with the board game, what with \u201cBattleship\u201d capitalized at the beginning of the clue, and took a huge leap of faith. Eventually getting 11D helped.\u2022 27A: Has your brain become primed to question any clue with a question mark? If you\u2019ve been reading for a while, it\u2019s a good habit to establish. A \u201cwet blanket\u201d is an idiom that means \u201cparty pooper\u201d in some circles, but if you think about it, DEW can be a wet blanket, too.\u2022 30A: Math alert! Well, not really; all you have to know is the number ONE. In the clue \u201cGirl\u2019s name in which the last three letters are equivalent to the first?\u201d, ONE is equivalent to 1 or I, so the answer is IONE.\u2022 46A: Speaking of the number one, read this clue carefully: \u201cOne not yet one, say\u201d hints at someone who is not yet the age of one, or an INFANT.\u2022 1D: \u201cOne might be involved in a sting\u201d is the kind of clue that should perk up your brain cells, especially on a Saturday. It sounds perfectly innocent, doesn\u2019t it? It\u2019s probably talking about some law enforcement sting operation, wouldn\u2019t you think? Not a chance. Stay suspicious, my friends. If you see a clue sitting there all quiet and innocent-like, immediately become suspicious and start thinking of alternate meanings for the word \u201csting.\u201d Today, the answer is WASP.\u2022 3D: Another clue word to look for: \u201cit.\u201d Use it as a substitution for the answer, if that helps. In the clue \u201cStick with it,\u201d you\u2019re being misled into thinking that the answer has to do with persistence, but it doesn\u2019t here. If you reread the clue as \u201cStick with ___,\u201d you\u2019re much closer to guessing that the answer is TAPE.\u2022 26D: Use the crossings, Luke. That\u2019s pretty much the only way I know of to get ONE IN FORTY for \u201c2.5%.\u201dI usually try to set a goal or two for every themeless I make.It may be specific entries I\u2019d like to see the light of day in a puzzle, or perhaps a wide-open grid that has caught my eye, or even an interesting stacking pattern in the middle of the grid. For this puzzle I wanted W-X-Y-Z in the four corners, in order. Nailed it!Also wanted dual symmetry with radiating triple stacks of 10-letter entries in each corner. Failed on both counts by including a pair of cheater squares when I became enamored with X AND Y AXES. Oh well. But I did like the open flow through the center from the stacks. I picture this type of center like the tines of a pasta server with intertwined entries acting like spaghetti flowing every which way in the grid. Yum.Your thoughts?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Tesla and SolarCity Deal, a Glimpse of Musk\u2019s Clean-Energy Aspirations", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the face of questions about debt, widening losses, governance and strategic logic, Tesla Motors and SolarCity announced a $2.6 billion stock merger on Monday.Now, it is up to Elon Musk to persuade the shareholders of the two companies \u2014 he founded both \u2014 that the deal makes sense. The transaction requires the approval this year of a majority of shareholders from both Tesla and SolarCity, excluding Mr. Musk and other insiders.Completion of the deal may come down to whether enough investors have the patience to accept the near-term headaches while waiting for Mr. Musk\u2019s long-term vision.His idea is that Tesla\u2019s batteries could store the power that SolarCity\u2019s panels have harnessed, a bet on the increasing use of solar energy. Most analysts, though, say this vision could take years, maybe even decades, to play out on a large scale \u2014 often longer than many investors tend to wait.\u201cI don\u2019t know why people would be voting in favor of it,\u201d said Efraim Levy, chief automotive analyst at Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Market Intelligence. \u201cThe valuation is excessive given the current prospects and the time horizon we\u2019re looking at.\u201dBut Mr. Musk, who also founded a third company with the hope of sending humans to Mars one day, is known for his visionary zeal. By doing this deal, he sees Tesla eventually moving beyond autos to become more of a clean-energy company that also happens to sell cars.\u201cThis is really all part of solving the sustainable-energy problem,\u201d Mr. Musk said in a conference call with analysts on Monday. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re all doing this \u2014 is to try to accelerate the advent of a sustainable-energy world.\u201dFrom Zip2 to OpenAI, a look at the entrepreneur\u2019s many companies.The stocks traded on Monday as if most investors expected the deal would get done. Under the terms of the deal, SolarCity shareholders will receive 0.11 Tesla shares for each SolarCity share they own. That represents $25.30 per SolarCity share, or about 58 cents under where the shares ended trading on Monday.Subsequently, independent members of the Tesla and SolarCity boards conducted due diligence and consulted with financial and legal advisers to arrive at the agreed-upon price.Tesla, which will report its second-quarter earnings on Wednesday, is going through a major transition as a car company. It is expanding its assembly plant in California, in hopes of beginning to fill the more than 300,000 preorders for its coming Model 3 sedan by next year. To speed the process, Mr. Musk has overhauled his manufacturing team, bringing in new executives from rival automakers such as Audi.Tesla is also facing more pressure from federal regulators and Congress about its Autopilot assisted-driving system, which was operational in a Model S that crashed into the side of a tractor-trailer in Florida on May 7. The driver, Joshua Brown, was killed in the accident \u2014 the first known fatality in a vehicle being driven by computer technology.Tesla has until late August to respond to a set of detailed questions from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration about the accident, as well any others involving the Autopilot system, which includes assisted steering, adaptive cruise control, collision avoidance and emergency braking.The National Transportation Safety Board and the Senate Commerce Committee are also investigating the incident.The safety investigations may not directly affect the approval process for the proposed merger. But they could be seen as setbacks in Tesla\u2019s grand expansion strategy, and a distraction for Mr. Musk as he tries to win over investors.Monday\u2019s deal includes a so-called go-shop period, which enables SolarCity to continue soliciting proposals from other parties until Sept. 14.The two companies plan to cut about $150 million in costs through the transaction in the first full year after the deal closes. They expect customers to benefit through lower hardware and installation costs, and they plan to use Tesla\u2019s 190 stores to expand SolarCity\u2019s reach.Through Tesla\u2019s stores, SolarCity would get easier, cheaper access to millions of customers; SolarCity has struggled to reduce its customer acquisition costs. In addition, it could benefit from the carmaker\u2019s expertise in manufacturing, just as SolarCity prepares to produce its own solar panels at a heavily subsidized factory in Buffalo.Mr. Rive, of SolarCity, said in the conference call that he expected almost all solar systems to include battery storage within three to five years, and that the combined company would be able to prosper by providing those systems, along with energy services for the grid. Adding rooftop solar to the overall energy mix, Mr. Musk said, would allow utility companies to avoid building new substations and transmission lines as the rising use of electric vehicles and heating systems increases demand for power.The merger, he said, would help Tesla take better advantage of all the customers it attracts to its stores by offering them more products. Making the solar systems appealing, he said, was important.Although some investors have expressed support for the deal, many analysts and investors have continued to question whether it makes sense for the carmaker to take on SolarCity, which has piled on debt as it seeks to continue its aggressive expansion. Last month, SolarCity said it had raised $345 million in tax-equity financing and added $110 million to a loan agreement, bringing its total to $760 million.And on Monday, SolarCity reduced projections for residential system installations for 2016 by nearly 10 percent because the pace of installations had been slower than expected in the first half of the year.Many analysts are still optimistic that, despite the risks, the deal will ultimately get done.\u201cEverything about Elon is for the long term,\u201d said David Whiston, an analyst with Morningstar. \u201cI suspect the big, institutional shareholders understand that and they\u2019re all in on Elon, and I expect the large shareholders will vote yes for the deal.\u201dDiane Cardwell contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Setting the Body\u2019s \u2018Serial Killers\u2019 Loose on Cancer", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "After a long, intense pursuit, researchers are close to bringing to market a daring new treatment: cell therapy that turbocharges the immune system to fight cancer.Supported byBETHESDA, Md. \u2014 The young surgeon was mystified. A fist-size tumor had been removed from the stomach of his patient 12 years earlier, but his doctors had not been able to cut out many smaller growths in his liver. The cancer should have killed him, yet here he lay on the table for a routine gallbladder operation.The surgeon, Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg, examined the man\u2019s abdominal cavity, sifting his liver in his fingers, feeling for hard, dense tumors \u2014 but he could find no trace of cancer.It was 1968. Dr. Rosenberg had a hunch he had just witnessed an extraordinary case in which a patient\u2019s immune system had vanquished cancer. Hoping there was an elixir in the man\u2019s blood, Dr. Rosenberg got permission to transfuse some of it into a patient dying of stomach cancer. The effort failed. But it was the beginning of a lifelong quest.\u201cSomething began to burn in me,\u201d he would write later, \u201csomething that has never gone out.\u201dHalf a century later, Dr. Rosenberg, who turns 76 on Tuesday and is chief of surgery at the National Cancer Institute here, is part of a small fraternity of researchers who have doggedly pursued a dream \u2014 turbocharging the body\u2019s immune system so that more cancer patients can experience recoveries like his long-ago patient\u2019s.Dr. Rosenberg, Dr. Carl H. June of the University of Pennsylvania and Dr. Michel Sadelain of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center have been at the forefront of this research for decades, laboring in separate labs in an intense sometimes-cooperative, sometimes-competitive pursuit to bring to fruition a daring therapy that few colleagues believed would work. Now, versions of the therapy for a limited number of blood cancers are nearing approval by federal regulators, and could reach the market as early as next year.The technique, known as cell therapy, gives each patient an individualized and souped-up version of their own immune system, one that \u201cworks better than nature made it,\u201d as Dr. June puts it.The patient\u2019s T-cells, the soldiers of the immune system, are extracted from the patient\u2019s blood, then genetically engineered to recognize and destroy cancer. The redesigned cells are multiplied in the laboratory, and millions or billions of them are put back into the patient\u2019s bloodstream, set loose like a vast army of tumor assassins.This is an unusual pharmaceutical \u2014 a drug that is alive and can multiply once inside the body. Dr. June calls these cells \u201cserial killers.\u201d A single one can destroy up to 100,000 cancer cells.The killer cells are genetically engineered to produce a complex protein, an amalgam of pieces from different parts of the immune system that is unlike anything seen before.\u201cI call it a Frankenstein-like molecule,\u201d said Dr. Renier J. Brentjens, the director of cellular therapeutics at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.This radical, science-fictionlike therapy differs sharply from the more established type of immunotherapy, developed by other researchers. Those off-the-shelf drugs, known as checkpoint inhibitors, release a molecular brake on the immune system, freeing it to fight the cancer much as it fights infections by bacteria or viruses.Cell therapy, in contrast, is brewed specially for each patient, one of the many challenges the field faces in broadening its use. So far, the number of patients treated with cell therapy is in the hundreds, not thousands. And for now it works only for certain types of blood cancers, not common malignancies like breast and lung cancer. Researchers are also still working out how to control potentially lethal side effects. Just recently, a clinical trial was briefly halted after three patients died of brain swelling.Still, cell therapy has produced complete remissions in some patients who were out of treatment options, stirring excitement among doctors and patients and setting off a race among companies to bring the treatments to market.Getting to this point has taken decades of painstaking work, with many false starts and setbacks.\u201cIt was conceivable we were pursuing a ghost,\u201d Dr. Rosenberg recalled.The son of Orthodox Jews who immigrated from Poland to New York and ran luncheonettes, Steven Rosenberg was about 6 years old when his family learned that many relatives, including six of his father\u2019s nine siblings, had been murdered in the Holocaust.\u201cI saw so much evil in the world that early on I decided I wanted to do something that would help people, not hurt people,\u201d he said in an interview here. He received a medical degree from Johns Hopkins and a doctorate in biophysics from Harvard.From the start, he was a workaholic. At one point he tried to call off his relationship with Alice O\u2019Connell, whom he would later marry, because he was afraid it would distract him from research.\u201cI loved the night,\u201d Dr. Rosenberg wrote in his book, \u201cThe Transformed Cell,\u201d published in 1992. \u201cI remember the exhilaration of working through the night in the lab, drinking thick pasty coffee that had been on the burner for hours, walking out into the sunrise.\u201d He added: \u201cTo be alone and out on the edge like that, there was no feeling like it in the world.\u201dWhen Dr. Rosenberg arrived at the National Cancer Institute in 1974, his first attempt at immunotherapy was to give patients T-cells harvested from pigs. That failed.He then began giving patients interleukin-2, or IL-2, a protein made by the body that spurs T-cells to proliferate. In some cases he treated patients with their own white blood cells that had been incubated in IL-2. The treatments sometimes set off such a violent immune system reaction that patients had to be placed in intensive care.From 1980 to 1984, he treated 66 patients without success. Then, in late 1984, he encountered patient No. 67, Linda Taylor, a Navy officer with melanoma whose personnel file carried the stamp \u201cdeath imminent.\u201dThe New York Times would like to hear from doctors and patients who have experience giving or receiving immunotherapy treatment for cancer.Ms. Taylor is still alive; her case and others catapulted Dr. Rosenberg and IL-2 onto the cover of Newsweek and the front pages of newspapers. Some of his colleagues at the National Cancer Institute began referring to him as Stevie Wonder, thinking he had developed a swelled head.But IL-2\u2019s vaunted prowess fizzled, helping only a few percent of patients with melanoma or kidney cancer.Dr. Rosenberg then tried to surgically remove tumors and extract the T-cells that had already penetrated them, so-called tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. He multiplied those cells in the lab and infused them back in the patient, along with shots of IL-2. He limited his focus to melanoma, the skin cancer that seemed most susceptible to immune attack.The treatment eventually achieved remissions in about 10 percent to 25 percent of patients. But it was labor-intensive and its application to other cancers unclear.There had to be a better way. Indeed, one approach was taking shape across the street from Dr. Rosenberg, at the Naval Medical Research Institute in Bethesda.The Navy was not Carl June\u2019s desired career choice. Accepted at Stanford in 1971, he instead chose the Naval Academy to avoid the draft and Vietnam. The Navy sent him to medical school and for training in bone-marrow transplantation, geared toward treating people irradiated by nuclear weapons.When the Cold War ended, the Navy lost interest.Dr. June turned to working with T-cells at the Naval Medical Research Institute in the mid-1980s. He and a colleague, Dr. Bruce Levine, found a way to multiply T-cells in huge numbers outside the body, a method still used today. And in the mid-1990s, working with Cell Genesys, a gene therapy company, Dr. June began trying to genetically modify patients\u2019 T-cells to kill H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS.But when his wife, Cindy, the mother of the couple\u2019s three children, developed ovarian cancer in 1996, Dr. June\u2019s research turned personal.Dr. June had tried everything to save her, including the primitive immune therapies under development. But Ms. June died in 2001.\u201cA lot of other scientists would have been disillusioned by the failure, in his case the personal tragedy,\u201d said Sean Parker, the internet billionaire who is funding some of Dr. June\u2019s work.Instead, Dr. June, who had moved to the University of Pennsylvania, stopped treating patients, and devoted himself to creating cell therapies for cancer.\u201cThings that were back burner on cell therapy became front burner,\u201d he said.In the 1980s, scientists began experimenting with gene therapy, putting new genes into cells of the body to treat disease. Michel Sadelain, while still a graduate student studying immunology at the University of Alberta, told colleagues that he thought the technique could be used to supercharge T-cells to fight cancer.\u201cAt the time it sounded very pipe dream,\u201d said Douglas Green, who was one of Dr. Sadelain\u2019s doctoral thesis advisers and is now chairman of immunology at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital.But Dr. Sadelain, he continued, \u201cbelieved in his approach and he pursued it relentlessly.\u201dAfter earning his Ph.D., Dr. Sadelain headed for the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Mass., to learn how to do gene therapy, using disabled viruses that could not cause disease to deliver genes into cells. By 1992, he had demonstrated that he could genetically engineer mouse T-cells.He then moved to Sloan Kettering. In 2003, he and his colleagues \u2014 including his partner and now wife, Isabelle Rivi\u00e8re \u2014 showed that genetically engineered T-cells could eradicate certain cancers in mice.How is this done? To fight cancer, T-cells have to recognize cancerous cells.Each T-cell in the body has unique receptors, sort of like claws that jut out from its surface. T-cells patrol the body looking for protein fragments that indicate a cell might be infected by a bacterium or virus. If one of its claws latches on to such a fragment, the T-cell destroys the cell displaying it.But cancer cells are mutated versions of the body\u2019s own cells, not outsiders. T-cells do not always recognize them as something to kill.So scientists like Dr. Sadelain decided to put a new claw on the T-cells, one that could recognize cancer by latching on to a telltale protein on cancer cells.The new claws came from another part of the immune system known as antibodies. Drug companies already knew how to make antibodies with claws that bind to specific proteins in the body.But the claw was not enough. Once a claw binds to a target protein, it needs a molecule to signal the T-cell to go into killing mode. Yet another signal helps sustain the killing. The DNA instructions for all three components are inserted into the patient\u2019s T-cells.Since this concoction is part antibody and part T-cell, it is a chimera, like the monster of Greek mythology that is part lion, part goat and part serpent. The claw is called a receptor and the protein it binds to on the cancer cell, the target, is called an antigen. So the whole construct is called a chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, and the use of it to treat cancer is called CAR T-cell therapy, or CAR-T.Dr. Sadelain was not alone in this work. Zelig Eshhar, an Israeli scientist, is credited with developing one of the first crude CARs around 1989. Dr. Rosenberg, always on the lookout for new types of immunotherapy, invited Dr. Eshhar to be a visiting scientist in his laboratory at the National Cancer Institute.Another early developer was Dr. Dario Campana of St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital.As scientists worked to perfect the formula in the 1990s and early 2000s, there was quite a bit of sharing. Cancer cell therapy was still mostly an academic exercise; it was highly uncertain whether it would ever really work.Dr. June, after hearing a presentation by Dr. Campana at a conference in 2003, requested a sample of Dr. Campana\u2019s CAR. Dr. Sadelain shared his design with both Dr. June and Dr. Rosenberg. The most prominent CAR developed at the National Cancer Institute owes a lot to Dr. Sadelain, Dr. Rosenberg said.But the science proved difficult and the research money scarce. Pharmaceutical companies showed little interest, preferring mass-produced drugs, one size fits all, rather than a treatment that would be made separately for each patient.Again, a death from cancer propelled the field forward. In 2001, a 44-year-old woman, Kimberly Lawrence Netter, succumbed to breast cancer. Her father-in-law, Edward Netter, a wealthy financial services entrepreneur, and his wife, Barbara, formed the nonprofit Alliance for Cancer Gene Therapy, which issued some of its first grants to Dr. June and Dr. Sadelain. Dr. June also got support from the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.\u201cWithout that,\u201d Dr. June said of the charities, \u201cwe would not have had a clinical trial.\u201dAs the first decade of this century neared its end, the three pioneers were ready for the big moment \u2014 testing their treatments in patients. They scrambled to be the first to announce peer-reviewed results.Dr. Rosenberg and colleagues published first, in the journal Blood in 2010. They described a single patient with lymphoma whose tumors shrank after treatment. (The patient later received more therapy, and has been free of cancer since.)But the approach really attracted attention the next year when Dr. June reported that two of three patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia went into complete remission.One of them, Doug Olson, a chemist from Tinicum Township, Pa., left the hospital and immediately bought a sailboat. He also took to running half-marathons.\u201cIt was like this weight that had been sitting there was gone,\u201d said Mr. Olson, who is free of cancer nearly six years later.Bill Ludwig, a retired captain in the New Jersey Department of Corrections, had already paid for his funeral when he started treatment in August 2010. Once his genetically engineered T-cells were unleashed in his system, Mr. Ludwig\u2019s lungs started to fail, his legs ballooned to twice their size, his blood pressure dropped and he began hallucinating.When he emerged from the ordeal, doctors searched for cancer. Detecting none, they ordered another test, certain of error. But there was no mistake. Five pounds of tumor had been destroyed.Mr. Ludwig, now 71, and his wife bought an R.V. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make up for lost time,\u201d he said. He has celebrated the high school graduations of five grandchildren and welcomed his first great-grandchild.As for Dr. June, Mr. Ludwig said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe someone who basically saved your life. He lost the one he loved, and turned around and saved me years later.\u201dThe 2011 publication of Dr. June\u2019s results transformed the field.Novartis, the big Swiss pharmaceutical company, licensed the rights to the therapies created in Dr. June\u2019s lab at the University of Pennsylvania, throwing aside concerns that treatments manufactured for individual patients would not be good business. That set off a commercial rush, flooding the field with cash after years of doubt.While various companies are in pursuit, three are in the lead. They hope to win approval from the Food and Drug Administration to bring the first CAR treatments to market as early as 2017 or 2018, although it is not yet clear how easy it will be to get regulatory approval for such a novel therapy.The companies are teamed with academic pioneers: Novartis with Penn; Kite Pharma with the National Cancer Institute; and Juno Therapeutics with Sloan Kettering, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital.Somewhat predictably, success provoked jostling and envy. Rather than being allies against a disbelieving world, the pioneers now had something worth fighting over \u2014 credit, and the gleam of a possible Nobel Prize.While the Sloan Kettering researchers had done some of the early genetic engineering, they did not publish strong results in five patients until 2013. By then, they had been scooped by Dr. Rosenberg with one patient and Dr. June with three.St. Jude sued the University of Pennsylvania. Novartis sided with Penn, and Juno Therapeutics with St. Jude.Patrick M. Coughlin, who teaches anatomy at the Commonwealth Medical College in Scranton, Pa., now explains the immune system to his classes by telling how one man overcame cancer. Only gradually does it become clear that he is referring to himself.Now 63, Mr. Coughlin noticed a mass the size of a softball in his abdomen in summer 2013. It was a form of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. Three different types of chemotherapy and a bone-marrow transplant all failed to help him. Desperate, he came to the National Institutes of Health campus here last year for the cell therapy developed by Dr. Rosenberg\u2019s team.The battle between Mr. Coughlin\u2019s genetically engineered immune cells and the cancer was brutal. For four days he had a fever as high as 105, chills and bed-soaking sweats. Even his brain malfunctioned \u2014 at one point he could not count to 10 or write his wife\u2019s name.But when the battle ended, the cancer was no longer there. \u201cIf I had gotten this thing five years ago,\u201d he said of his disease, \u201cI\u2019d be dead.\u201dYet for all the excitement, there are reasons for caution. The CAR therapy works now only for patients with some B-cell lymphomas and leukemias, which account for only about 80,000 of the 1.7 million cases of cancer diagnosed in the United States each year. It has not been successfully used to treat malignancies of the lungs, breast, prostate, colon or other organs.\u201cThe solid tumors that kill over 90 percent of people do not respond to anything we have now,\u201d Dr. Rosenberg said.Because it is personalized, cell therapy is likely to be frightfully expensive \u2014 probably hundreds of thousands of dollars per patient, though the companies bringing these treatments to market have not yet said how much they would charge.Producing the re-engineered cells is lengthy and complex. Some patients have died during the two to four weeks it took to genetically modify and multiply their cells.And the therapy itself can be arduous. First, patients get chemotherapy to wipe out many of their existing T-cells to make room for the engineered ones. Once those enter the body, they can set off a ferocious immune response as well as temporary neurological problems like memory loss, seizures and hallucinations.Recently Juno Therapeutics had to temporarily halt its clinical trial after three patients died from brain swelling. The problem arose when the company added a second chemotherapy drug to the regimen preparing the patients for the cell infusion. The authorities allowed the trial to resume without that chemotherapy drug.Still, some patients find themselves hoping they get violently ill, since that is a sign the treatment is working.\u201cEvery morning my wife would ask me how I\u2019m feeling,\u201d said Myles Stiefvater, a copier salesman from Newark, Del., who had the treatment in 2014. When he said he felt O.K., they were disappointed.Researchers are also finding, to their dismay, that remissions do not always last. The therapy has had its biggest success in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, producing complete remissions for 60 percent to more than 90 percent of patients. Yet up to half of those patients eventually suffer a relapse.In some cases, the tumor evolves so that it no longer displays on its surface what the claw binds to, making it invisible to the engineered cells. In other cases, the engineered cells might not last long enough in the body, giving the cancer a chance to resurge.Karen Shollenberger, a student at Drexel University with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, thought she was in the clear after being in remission for nine months after a CAR-T treatment.But in September, as the school year was beginning, the cancer returned.She entered a new trial testing a new CAR therapy directed at another protein on B-cells. Again the cancer went into remission, and she returned to school.But fear lurked in her: What if the new therapy also stopped working? That indeed happened recently. Her best hope now is a bone-marrow transplant.\u201cEach relapse is increasingly terrifying as the options continue to shrink,\u201d said Ms. Shollenberger, 22. But, she said, the cell therapies have given her nearly two good years.The big thrust now is to expand the use of cell therapy to additional types of cancer.The key is to find protein targets that the engineered T-cells can latch on to to kill cancer cells. Ideally, such a protein should be on all the tumor cells, so the entire cancer would be eradicated. But it should not be on healthy cells, or they would also be destroyed, causing side effects.\u201cT-cells are very powerful,\u201d said Dr. Campana, formerly of St. Jude and now at the National University of Singapore. \u201cIn the same way they can eliminate cancer, they can also kill you.\u201dA protein called HER2, for instance, is found on many breast and other tumors, making it a seemingly good target. But it is also found in tiny amounts in the lungs. When Dr. Rosenberg\u2019s team infused killer T-cells aimed at HER2 into a patient, she went into respiratory distress within 15 minutes and died five days later.The treatments work for the blood cancers because there is a good target. But finding these for the most common cancers has been difficult.One problem is that CARs, because of how they are made, can bind only to proteins on the surface of cancer cells. But most proteins made by these cells, or by any cell for that matter, are inside the cell, out of reach.There is an alternative approach that is gaining interest. Patients\u2019 immune cells can be engineered to make what are called T-cell receptors, or TCRs. These can recognize proteins inside the cancer cells.Some experts say TCRs, which have a far wider array of potential targets, represent the best hope of using cell therapy to treat solid tumors. There have been hints of effectiveness already in treating one of those, a type of sarcoma.It might turn out that the best target for each patient will be unique to that person. Scientists are now experimenting with using DNA sequencing and other techniques to find the best mutated protein in each person\u2019s tumor at which to aim the claw.\u201cThink of how dauntingly personalized this is,\u201d Dr. Rosenberg said. \u201cWe are using their own cells to treat a unique mutation in their own tumor.\u201dHe said this approach might allow cell therapy to be used for most patients.Many other improvements are on the runway.Dr. Sadelain and Juno are working on \u201carmored CARs\u201d that not only bind to the target but produce immune-stimulating chemicals. Cellectis, a French company, has treated two babies with an off-the-shelf CAR treatment that does not require each patient\u2019s cells to be processed. Bellicum Pharmaceuticals is working on genetic switches that dim or shut off the CAR if the treatment is endangering the patient.\u201cWe\u2019re in the Model T version of the CAR now,\u201d said Dr. Levine, now the director of the cell production facility at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cWhat\u2019s coming along are Google CARs and Tesla CARs.\u201dIn February, the Novartis-Penn Center for Advanced Cellular Therapeutics opened on the ninth floor of a Penn medical building, paid for mainly by $20 million from Novartis. It has gleaming new laboratory space, clean rooms with the capacity to manufacture therapy for 400 patients a year, and a great view of downtown Philadelphia. On the wall are photographs of patients with success stories, like Doug Olson running a half-marathon and, of course, Emily Whitehead.Dr. June, who remarried and had two more children, now jets off regularly to attend conferences and give talks. A world map hanging outside his office is titled \u201cWhere in the World Is Carl June?\u201d It has pins stuck in every location he has been, and a picture of him on a bicycle pinned to his location at the moment.In the last two years he has visited more than 150 cities in more than 20 countries. This year alone he has accumulated more than 200,000 airline miles. Despite that schedule, he runs ultramarathons and participated in July in the Death Ride, a grueling bicycle race in California.Dr. Rosenberg still arrives at the National Cancer Institute nearly seven days a week. The walls outside his office are covered with signed photographs of the hundreds of fellows who have trained under him, many of them now leaders in immunotherapy. Every five years, they gather for a reunion, to reminisce and honor their mentor.Arie Belldegrun, who was a fellow in the 1980s, now runs Kite, the company commercializing the National Cancer Institute\u2019s CAR technology. He recounted what happened when he tried to get Dr. Rosenberg to join the company.\u201cHe sits quietly, quietly, quietly, and then he asks, \u2018Arie, why don\u2019t you ask me what I want to do?\u2019\u201cHe said: \u2018Every day that I go to work, I\u2019m as excited as a kid coming to a new place for the first time. If you ask me what I want to do, I want to die on this desk one day.\u2019\u201dBut not before he conquers cancer.\u201cI want to end this holocaust,\u201d Dr. Rosenberg said in the interview. \u201cI think I\u2019m finally getting the hang of what it will take to widely apply this to cancers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Producing Clean Power Turned Out to Be a Messy Business", "Date": "2016-08-13", "News": "Supported byOn the edge of a bucolic field in Princeton, N.J., an eco-friendly office building recently opened its doors. Plants festoon the roof, a living wall is planned for the lobby, and rainwater storage tanks supply the building\u2019s needs. In the parking lot there are wind turbines, solar panels and electric vehicle charging stations.It is the picture of a sustainable future, one in which society\u2019s insatiable demand for electricity can be met without polluting the planet.The same cannot be said of the building\u2019s tenant, NRG Energy.The biggest independent power producer in the country, NRG sells electricity to utilities, companies and individual homes. To generate all that wattage, it burns enormous amounts of natural gas, coal and oil, making NRG one of the country\u2019s biggest polluters.It isn\u2019t trying to muck up the planet; that\u2019s just the nature of the business NRG is in. The electricity industry is the biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. In 2014, NRG was the fourth-largest emitter of carbon dioxide among the country\u2019s power producers.The business of providing Americans with electricity hasn\u2019t evolved much in a century. But today, growing concerns about climate change, affordable wind and solar power, and the potential for distributed generation are pressuring utilities and power producers like NRG to clean up their acts, and fast.\u201cOur industry is going though massive transformation, the likes of which we\u2019ve never seen,\u201d said Mauricio Gutierrez, the recently installed chief executive of NRG. \u201cThe industry has never seen this much turnover.\u201dAll this transformation has been particularly tumultuous for NRG, which has weathered more than its share of mishaps and unintended consequences: In May, for example, a fire knocked out a crucial tower at a cutting-edge but troubled solar power plant that the company manages in the Southern California desert. Its big bets on residential solar and on a national charging network for electric vehicles were ahead of their time and fizzled.The shale and fracking booms in the United States made natural gas cheap and abundant, pulling down the price of electricity and making power sources that NRG still depends on heavily \u2014 including coal, nuclear and renewables \u2014 less profitable. Investors lost faith in the company, NRG\u2019s stock plummeted, and its previous chief executive was summarily fired, replaced by Mr. Gutierrez.Far from emerging as an industry pioneer, NRG has become a cautionary tale. A power-hungry nation needs to change the way it is fueled, but as NRG shows, transitioning to clean power is messy business.\u201cThe power producers and utilities are the canaries in the coal mine,\u201d said Aron Cramer, C.E.O. of Business for Social Responsibility, a consulting firm. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a lot of road kill in the midst of this transition to a lower-carbon energy system.\u201dNo two companies face the exact same set of challenges. But at some level, the quandary preoccupying NRG is one that all power producers and utilities will ultimately face: how to make more electricity while emitting fewer greenhouse gases.NRG wasn\u2019t always a clean-energy proponent. Until recently, it was just another power producer, burning fossil fuels to electrify the grid.In 2003, it tapped David Crane to be its chief executive. Mr. Crane, who previously ran a traditional London-based power company, set about expanding NRG\u2019s core business. He acquired Reliant Energy, which sells electricity to homes and businesses in Texas, as well as GenOn Energy, a rival based in Houston. These moves vastly expanded NRG\u2019s scale, and its emissions.By 2006, Mr. Crane began to respond to the climate crisis and became one of the country\u2019s most unlikely environmentalists.At first, he made modest changes. NRG bought a wind power company, which it later sold. Soon, though, Mr. Crane made large investments in wind and solar plants and spent heavily on pet projects like a national network of electric-car charging stations.Seemingly overnight, the fossil fuels executive became a champion of renewable energy. He wanted to turn the hub-and-spoke utility model \u2014 with big power plants sending electricity out to homes and businesses \u2014 inside out.\u201cIt\u2019s the destiny of NRG to be a leader,\u201d Mr. Crane said at the groundbreaking of the new headquarters, \u201cto create a more sustainable and prosperous future while winning the fight against climate change.\u201dMr. Crane was channeling the spirit of the time. In December, world leaders in Paris pledged to combat climate change. The United States said it would cut its greenhouse gas emissions by more than a quarter in 10 years. With wind and solar power cheaper than ever and consumers starting to embrace energy-saving technologies, these targets could be within reach.But the climate crisis won\u2019t be solved with more Teslas alone. If the goals set in Paris are to be met, big electricity producers like NRG will need to reduce emissions while increasing power production. So Mr. Crane set about trying to retool NRG\u2019s fleet of dirty power plants while building a new generation of utility-scale wind and solar projects.NRG\u2019s dual personality \u2014 fossil fuel giant and clean energy pioneer \u2014 is on display at two relatively new facilities on opposite ends of the country.Just south of Los Angeles International Airport, four smokestacks punctuate the sandy coastline. There in one form or another since the 1950s, they are part of the El Segundo Energy Center, which produces enough electricity to power nearly 450,000 homes.At first glance, it is just another power plant burning cheap and abundant natural gas. Yet the El Segundo plant is among the most sophisticated of its kind. The two operational units, which came online in 2013, replaced inefficient relics constructed a half-century ago. Wastewater is recycled, emissions controls minimize the production of nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide, and a mix of combustion and steam turbines greatly enhance the amount of energy derived from the gas.And perhaps most critically, the El Segundo Energy Center is only occasionally generating power.A generation ago, it operated almost constantly, feeding the vast energy needs of Los Angeles. But over the last several years, big power companies \u2014 including NRG \u2014 have constructed enormous solar power plants in Southern California, supplying a growing share of daytime electricity.When the sun is shining, NRG\u2019s new high-tech gas-fired power plant is often dormant, coming alive only when demand ramps up and the sun has dimmed. In that sense, the El Segundo plant is a big leap forward. Yet the very need to pour millions of dollars into retrofitting this gas-fired plant on the picturesque shore of the Pacific Ocean shows just how much work has yet to be done.Across the country, in Spencer, Mass., NRG is putting the final touches on a community solar project on the grounds of St. Joseph\u2019s Abbey, a Trappist monastery. There, on rolling green hills near the monks\u2019 quarters, hundreds of hard-hatted workers are busy erecting thousands of solar panels.The electricity generated from those panels will flow through new transmission lines, which were required because the existing grid infrastructure could not handle the influx of solar energy. The project will power about 2,000 nearby homes, which should have lower and more reliable electricity bills.By NRG\u2019s standards, the solar plant is relatively small, but more are in the works. With enough such plants on the grid, they could help NRG achieve its ambitious emissions reductions targets.This is exactly the kind of change that Mr. Crane championed. And yet he is no longer the chief executive of NRG. He was abruptly fired in December, after NRG stock plummeted 63 percent in a year.Earnings fell as cheap natural gas made NRG\u2019s coal-fired plants less competitive, and investors had grown weary of Mr. Crane\u2019s focus on clean energy. Even as NRG\u2019s core business was losing money, Mr. Crane devoted much of his quarterly earnings calls to discussions about clean-power projects.\u201cWe all believe in renewables,\u201d said Shahriar Pourreza, an analyst with Guggenheim Partners. \u201cBut there was such a change in the message of the company that investors lost confidence in the management team.\u201dThe NRG board named the company\u2019s chief operating officer, Mr. Gutierrez, as the new leader. He had grown up in Mexico City, where electricity was sometimes spotty. Mr. Gutierrez joined his family\u2019s engineering company, then worked for Dynegy, a power producer in Houston, before joining NRG. Yet he says that like his predecessor, he is committed to environmental stewardship.\u201cWhen a spiritual leader like the pope calls out our moral responsibility toward the environment, it\u2019s a pretty big thing,\u201d Mr. Gutierrez said. \u201cIt transcends science and policy.\u201dHe was engaged in efforts to combat climate change well before Paris. As Mr. Crane\u2019s C.O.O., he led an NRG task force that recommended that the company adopt ambitious targets for emissions reduction. Mr. Gutierrez recently recommitted to those goals. \u201cRenewables is something that\u2019s very important for our portfolio,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s good business.\u201dMr. Gutierrez has a tricky balancing act. He must appease demanding investors and a skittish board, which most likely means reining in some of Mr. Crane\u2019s clean-energy ventures. Yet he must also fill the shoes of a chief executive who had raised hopes among environmentalists that a big energy producer was getting serious about climate change. He must profitably manage gas and coal assets \u2014 which still make up most of the company\u2019s power generation, sales and profits \u2014 while also preparing for a future that is more dependent on solar and wind.Analysts are pleased with Mr. Gutierrez\u2019s performance so far. He has simplified the corporate structure, played down some of Mr. Crane\u2019s side projects and focused on the balance sheet. NRG shares have risen 40 percent since Mr. Gutierrez took over.\u201cWith the old management, there was such a change in message, the company started to lose credibility,\u201d Mr. Pourreza said. \u201cMauricio is leading this company in the right direction.\u201dBut how NRG will actually achieve vast reductions in its carbon footprint is unclear. As long as it is burning so much gas and coal, it will remain a major emitter of greenhouse gases. And while Mr. Gutierrez speaks hopefully of developments in carbon-capture technology and utility-scale battery storage, practical solutions remain elusive. \u201cDo we have a perfect line of sight on how we\u2019re going to get there? No,\u201d he said. \u201cDo we have a road map? Yes.\u201dComplicating matters, the Obama administration\u2019s signature effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector \u2014 the Clean Power Plan \u2014 is tied up in the courts. (NRG was among the companies that petitioned the E.P.A. to modify the plan, arguing that it made the power sector too reliant on natural gas.) The ambiguous fate of that plan has added regulatory uncertainty to an industry already in flux.\u201cYou have these goals set in Paris, you have a framework for getting there through the Clean Power Plan, and you have the judicial branch saying stop,\u201d said Ralph Izzo, chief executive of Public Service Enterprise Group, a New Jersey utility. \u201cYou can\u2019t make economic decisions in that environment.\u201dEven NRG\u2019s big renewable projects \u2014 installations that are supposed to one day replace coal- and gas-fired plants \u2014 are mired in problems. In the Southern California desert, NRG oversees operations at Ivanpah, the world\u2019s largest solar thermal installation, where thousands of mirrors reflect the sun at enormous towers and water is converted to steam that powers turbines. NRG owns the plant along with BrightSource Energy and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.Heralded as a beacon of clean energy when it opened in 2014, Ivanpah has been continually troubled.From the outset, it produced less electricity than expected. Over the last few years, the cost of solar panels fell sharply, making Ivanpah\u2019s power comparatively expensive. In March, the consortium that owns the plant nearly defaulted on a contract with Pacific Gas & Electric, the Northern California utility.Then in May, a fire at the plant knocked out one of the towers, raising new questions about the project\u2019s viability. Last week, when NRG reported quarterly earnings, it said that revenue from its renewables businesses was down 14 percent to $57 million, largely the result of problems at Ivanpah.This isn\u2019t the first time that a big energy company has made ambitious plans to become a leader in green energy, only to be reined in. In 2000, BP introduced its \u201cBeyond Petroleum\u201d tagline and began investing heavily in renewable energy. It committed billions of dollars to wind and solar projects, and made investments in carbon capture and biofuels.After a decade of investment, BP largely backed off its renewables program. Most of its money was still coming from oil and gas, and the company set about selling its solar and wind power assets. They simply weren\u2019t profitable enough.\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to recall that 10 years ago BP was one of the darlings of the green movement,\u201d said Justin Adams, managing director of global lands for the Nature Conservancy and a former executive at BP working on renewables.\u201cThrough that period, some investors were interested, most were ambivalent at best and some downright skeptical at worst,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat on earth was BP doing, taking its eyes off its core business and tinkering around with renewables?\u201dAt NRG, Mr. Gutierrez has already backed away from residential solar and electric-vehicle charging projects that Mr. Crane held so dear. So far, however, there are no signs that NRG will completely reverse course. Mr. Gutierrez is still pushing community solar power, and NRG provides solar installations to big companies like Whole Foods. Last week, NRG spent nearly $200 million to acquire more solar and wind assets.Today, NRG generates about 9 percent of its electricity from renewable assets, up from less than 1 percent in 2008, and that figure is likely to grow. Across the industry, a majority of power plants being built today use renewables, not fossil fuels.\u201cThe sad moral of this story is that it\u2019s very hard to be a C.E.O. for tomorrow, when the markets only care about being a C.E.O. for today,\u201d said Mr. Cramer of Business for Social Responsibility. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone really questions his vision, but he wasn\u2019t given any opportunity to put it into action.\u201dMr. Gutierrez says he shares his predecessor\u2019s vision. By 2050, he envisions enormous batteries storing solar power generated during the day, allowing people to use it at night. Distributed energy will be more common, as Mr. Crane predicted. Carbon-capture technology will make the burning of fossil fuels much less environmentally destructive, Mr. Gutierrez hopes. Perhaps coal-fired power plants will be gone altogether.\u201cWe are a part of the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are also a big part of the solution.\u201dIt\u2019s an appealing vision of a green energy system, one that could fulfill the needs of an electricity-hungry world without spoiling the environment. But how NRG gets there \u2014 especially with investors and a board that seem intolerant of bold steps \u2014 remains vague at best. For now, Mr. Gutierrez is caught in the middle: hoping to arrive at a cleaner future while still satisfying today\u2019s investors, rolling out fields of solar while also burning tons of gas and coal.\u201cLet\u2019s all acknowledge that we can\u2019t change our energy system overnight,\u201d Mr. Cramer said. \u201cBut how do we start making meaningful progress? Saying 90 percent by 2050 is the easy part. We need to start making progress now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video Review: The Ferrari 488 GTB Is an Operatic Thrill", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDrivenCARS? Cars are transportation. Ferraris? They are something else altogether.The 488 GTB, which is the successor to the 458, is an automobile to be sure, but also equal parts art, science, music and Six Flags roller coaster riding on an aluminum structure.Want to know what it\u2019s like to be Oprah? Buy one of these. Fingers point. People jump and scream. Hundreds of smartphone cameras bear down on the sensuous aluminum skin. You\u2019ve been warned.This passport to instant celebrity status starts at about $250,000, but, undoubtedly, most 488 buyers will want extras. The example I\u2019m swooning over is $353,858, meaning the cost of the options alone would outfit a family of four with new Honda Civics for all. Of course, if you have to ask how much, you probably can\u2019t afford it.A blizzard of carbon fiber pieces make up most of the upcharges; the rear diffuser alone is $9,616. Don\u2019t miss the Goldrake carbon fiber seats at $10,799 (available in small, medium and large). Oh, and the $12,486 Rosso Corsa metallic paint is a must. God intended all Ferraris to have red paint this rich.Its predecessor, the 458, was naturally aspirated. The 3.9-liter V8 in the 488 gets twin-turbocharging. The result is a staggering 661 horsepower (or would that be stallions?) and 561 pound-feet of torque. Fun fact. The 488 gets its moniker from the displacement of each cylinder: 488cc.Power is routed to the back wheels through a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox. Nope, a manual transmission is not available for the three of you in America who might want one. Drive modes tailor the car from racetrack-ready to slogging through a crowd of drooling admirers. The 488 can be a pussycat to drive, if you want.It can also be a Saturn V rocket. Everyone should experience a zero to 60 miles-an-hour rush of 2.9 seconds at least once. The 488\u2019s precision and velocity make it easy to look down after a launch to discover triple digits on the speedo. I get it, Tesla\u2019s Model S can achieve similar oomph. The S does it, however, without (and this is important!) the operatic mechanical note that the Ferrari sings. It drills deep into your soul and never goes away.I\u2019d be lying if I claimed to have discovered the GTB\u2019s handling limits. It simply can\u2019t be done on public roads. Curved fins under the body near the front tires act as vortex generators, increasing downforce. Look closely at the huge gills on the rear hips to find they aren\u2019t just for engine cooling, they also vent out near the taillamps. Those and a subtle slot integrated into the tail act as aerodynamic aids. No tacked-on wings or spoilers sully the seductive shape here.This is not a quiet car \u2014 thank goodness \u2014 nor softly sprung. And while the adjustable suspension goes nowhere near cushy, a 200-mile day in the 488 GTB doesn\u2019t wring the life force out of a driver. Wallets take a drubbing though. Heavy on highway miles (and admittedly, much hard right-foot activity), I managed 17 miles per gallon using premium fuel. The E.P.A. rates it at 15 city and 22 highway.If I were judging this as a practical car, I\u2019d complain that the front trunk can carry only two carry-on-size suitcases, the navigational system is cumbersome to operate and my particular copy lacked a much-needed backup camera. There\u2019s no sunroof option either, so you\u2019ll have to go with the retractable-paneled Spider version for more sun. Sadly, the convertible also eliminates the crowd-pleasing glass dome that showcases the V8. Those form-fitting Goldrake seats are manually adjusted (a plus for me, actually).But no one turns to Maranello for practicality. Keep in mind, even if you have the funds to pay for a Ferrari, you can\u2019t just waltz into a dealership to snap one up.

{"Headline": "Everyone Despises SolarCity Deal, Except Tesla Shareholders", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseCorporate governance experts are up in arms, because Tesla\u2019s visionary founder, the entrepreneur Elon Musk, also founded SolarCity and is the largest shareholder in both companies. SolarCity\u2019s chief executive is Mr. Musk\u2019s cousin. There are overlapping directors. Critics called it blatant self-dealing and accused Mr. Musk of using valuable Tesla shares to bail out a struggling SolarCity.James S. Chanos \u2014 an investor who, it should be noted, is betting against both stocks \u2014 called it a \u201cshameful example of corporate governance at its worst.\u201dBut what if the critics are wrong?Many auto industry experts also said the idea of combining Tesla, an electric-car manufacturer, with SolarCity, which makes solar energy panels, makes no strategic sense. Even if energy generation, storage and an auto powertrain are a seamless product, so-called vertical integration, in which one manufacturer makes all the components, was the old Henry Ford model and later, General Motors\u2019. That approach has gone down in automotive history as a colossal failure.Adam Jonas, the influential auto industry analyst at Morgan Stanley, slashed his price target for Tesla and wrote in a note to clients that potential rewards would not adequately compensate investors for the greater risks and cash flow drain. Expanding into a non-auto business like solar energy exposes Tesla to \u201cuntested cost, competitive and regulatory forces,\u201d he warned.Perhaps the harshest verdict came from the market itself: Tesla shares dropped more than 10 percent the day the deal was announced.Mr. Musk \u201cwent overnight from being a genius to an idiot,\u201d said Joseph Dennison, portfolio manager at Zevenbergen Capital Investments, a large Tesla shareholder.Largely overlooked in the din, however, is that few, if any, of Tesla\u2019s harshest critics are Tesla\u2019s current shareholders. And they are the only ones who truly matter, because they\u2019ll have a vote on the deal and it\u2019s their money on the line.Tesla\u2019s four biggest shareholders after Mr. Musk are mutual fund managers, including the industry giants Fidelity, Vanguard and T. Rowe Price. None have announced how they\u2019ll vote, but they have a history of supporting management generally, and specifically Mr. Musk.Even before the deal was announced, a Fidelity portfolio manager, Gavin Baker, told investors, \u201cWe are fans not just of Tesla products but of the concepts underpinning the firm and potential future partnerships ahead of it.\u201dRonald Baron, founder of Baron Capital, which owns 1.5 million Tesla shares, said his initial reaction was, \u201cWhy on earth would anyone want to do this? Can\u2019t you buy these panels much cheaper in China?\u201dHe said he had looked into investing in SolarCity several times, and each time decided to pass (a wise decision considering that SolarCity shares have fallen more than 50 percent this year.)But after further research and discussions with Tesla management, Mr. Baron told me his concerns had been largely assuaged. \u201cUntil I read the proxy, I can\u2019t tell you how I\u2019m going to vote,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the more we researched this, the more sense it made to combine Tesla with solar panels. We believe they can make better products, make them more efficiently, and realize tremendous savings by selling the two products together.\u201dOther investors have also been reconsidering the merits of the deal. Tesla shares have more than recovered what they lost after the deal was announced. And investors brushed off an announcement on Wednesday of worse-than-expected quarterly losses, focusing instead on higher vehicle production and new orders.Tesla tried to do its best to allay concerns about Mr. Musk\u2019s conflict of interest. Mr. Musk will not vote, nor will other insiders who own shares in both companies, a step that was not mandated by law.Tesla maintains that various committees of directors that it says are independent vigorously negotiated terms of the deal, and that Mr. Musk did not know the price before it was agreed on. When the deal became final on Monday, the price was slightly lower than that announced in June, suggesting some genuine haggling went on.But realistically, Mr. Musk\u2019s dominant role in both companies means that \u201cit\u2019s an intractable problem,\u201d said Charles M. Elson, an expert in corporate governance at the University of Delaware. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to resolve this. The only way would be not to do it.\u201dTesla says that would elevate corporate governance purity at the expense of common sense. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to take every appropriate step\u201d to minimize the conflict issues, Todd A. Maron, Tesla\u2019s general counsel, told me this week. \u201cBut if there are synergies, which there are, and we can make the best product under one company\u2019s ownership, and we can persuade the independent shareholders to support the deal, there shouldn\u2019t be a strict prohibition just because someone is on both sides.\u201dMr. Dennison of Zevenbergen Capital said that focusing on conflicts \u201cis missing the bigger picture.\u201d\u201cTo make these future products as good, integrated and efficient as possible,\u201d he added, \u201cyou need the two companies working together.\u201d He said his firm had not announced how it would vote, but he has typically sided with management.From Zip2 to OpenAI, a look at the entrepreneur\u2019s many companies.As for making its own batteries and solar panels and being vertically integrated, Tesla maintains it had little choice. \u201cTesla does not believe in vertical integration as an objective in and of itself,\u201d Mr. Maron said, but \u201cgoes down that path because there\u2019s no better option.\u201d Tesla has said its planned auto production volume would consume \u201ctoday\u2019s entire worldwide production of lithium ion batteries.\u201d\u201cCreate a smoothly integrated and beautiful solar-roof-with-battery product that just works, empowering the individual as their own utility, and then scale that throughout the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t do this well if Tesla and SolarCity are different companies, which is why we need to combine and break down the barriers inherent to being separate companies.\u201dAdmittedly, that\u2019s a long-term vision that has little to do with the latest quarterly earnings. If Tesla owners were plugging their cars into outlets with electricity from coal-fired power plants, there would not be much sustainability to get excited about.\u201cMusk\u2019s vision from Day 1 10 years ago was to accelerate sustainable energy, \u201c said Mr. Dennison. \u201cThat\u2019s a much bigger vision than building cars.\u201dAnd vision is what Tesla\u2019s shareholders are buying into, just as Amazon investors put their faith in Jeff Bezos. That\u2019s why, for all the controversy, the SolarCity deal will almost surely be approved by Tesla shareholders.\u201cIf you\u2019re investing in a Musk business, you\u2019re investing in something that hasn\u2019t happened yet, so it\u2019s risky,\u201d said Mr. Baron. \u201cBut I love the guy. He\u2019s totally focused. He\u2019s already accomplished what people said could never be done.\u201dMr. Dennison agreed. \u201cYou\u2019re investing in the people who make and execute decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is obviously tied to a bigger picture and a longer-term road map than most. But Tesla management has executed on all the goals they\u2019ve laid out. I\u2019d say this is an investment based on faith, but not blind faith.\u201dThe Common Sense column on Aug. 5, about the proposed merger of Tesla Motors and SolarCity, described SolarCity\u2019s product incorrectly. The company makes solar energy generating panels, not storage devices.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Bolt\u2019s Long Shadow, Ashton Eaton\u2019s Excellence Peeks Through", "Date": "2016-08-19", "News": "Supported byOn OlympicsRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The decathletes, long ago a source of greater fascination, were in no position Thursday night to be anything more than a warm-up act for the headliner Usain Bolt.There is no dishonor in that. Bolt, with his easy charm and easily understood talents, is an irresistible force in the attention-grabbing department.Even before the Rio Olympics, he was considered the greatest sprinter ever. Now he is the first, and quite possibly the last, to sweep the 100 meters and the 200 meters in three consecutive Games.But there is potential all-time greatness at work in the decathlon, too, and Ashton Eaton has a very different task and style from Bolt.Bolt\u2019s events are over in a flash: 9.81 seconds in the 100, then 19.78 seconds in the 200. Eaton\u2019s work unfolds over two days and nights and 10 events, some of them contested in the heat of the day with few spectators in the stadium.Bolt is playful and brash, mugging for the cameras, pounding his chest and merrily reminding his frustrated opponents of their lot in life during and after the racing. Consider Thursday\u2019s comment about the 200-meter silver medalist Andre De Grasse, made with De Grasse sitting next to him: \u201cYou should always want to be the best,\u201d Bolt said. \u201cI respect him for that, but I tell every youngster, I don\u2019t allow young kids to beat me.\u2019\u201dEaton is measured and modest and would no sooner talk smack than he would turn down a chance to meet Elon Musk, the tech entrepreneur behind Tesla and SpaceX, who is Eaton\u2019s true aspirational figure.\u201cI think Ash might prefer being an engineer sometimes; I really do,\u201d said Don Butzner, Eaton\u2019s physical therapist.For now, he remains a decathlete, and though the focus Thursday was on Bolt\u2019s eighth career gold medal, Eaton joined an elite club of his own by successfully defending his Olympic title.\u201cThe decathlon is exclusive company,\u201d Eaton said after beating the fast-improving Frenchman K\u00e9vin Mayer for gold with a total of 8,893 points. \u201cI\u2019m just happy to be part of the family, the decathlon family, regardless of the records.\u201dIt does feel more like a brotherhood than a guild, and one of the more reaffirming moments in sports is when the decathlon\u2019s final event, the 1,500 meters, is done and the exhausted contestants \u2014 when they\u2019ve finally picked themselves up after collapsing \u2014 congratulate one another for simply finishing.\u201cWe are competing against ourselves,\u201d Eaton said.By that standard, Eaton lost Thursday, failing to surpass his world-record score of 9,045 points, set last year at the world championships in Beijing. But by purely Olympic standards, it was a more successful night, one that also gave the Eaton family its second track and field medal of these Games.Eaton\u2019s wife, Brianne Theisen-Eaton, who trains with him under their coach, Harry Marra, won a bronze medal last week for Canada in the heptathlon, the seven-event women\u2019s competition.She was there in the Olympic Stadium on Thursday night, just as Eaton had been there for her last week when he took some seriously out-of-line internet flak for wearing a Canada cap as a show of support.\u201cShe is a massive, massive inspiration for me,\u201d Eaton said Thursday. \u201cAnd for us to have done this together is \u2026\u201dHis voice began to break. \u201cI can\u2019t word it,\u201d he said, moving down the line in the interview area.Eaton had a string of injuries \u2014 nagging and more significant \u2014 this season. He tore a quadriceps muscle during a meet in the Czech Republic on May 20, which gave him little more than a month to heal before the United States Olympic trials in Eugene, Ore., in early July. \u201cIt was scary,\u201d Marra said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know whether that muscle would stay together at the trials. One event? O.K. But 10 events? Come on.\u201dThe problem, Marra said, was \u201ca big blood clot\u201d that was restricting Eaton\u2019s range of leg motion. \u201cLess than a week before the trials, they went in with a needle,\u201d Marra said. \u201cAnd the doctor says, \u2018Here we go,\u2019 and he pulled on this thing and the clot pulled right out into the syringe, and you could just see the muscle go back to its normal position.\u201dMarra said Eaton, by compensating for the quad injury, then strained a hamstring early in the trials and made just one attempt in the long jump. That jump, according to Marra, was Eaton\u2019s only one between May 20 and the Olympics, in an effort to protect his leg.That should help explain why Eaton never seriously challenged his world record in Rio, although he did tie the Olympic record.Afterward, there was \u2014 as is now customary at major championships \u2014 considerable discussion of why the decathlon, once the de facto method to determine the world\u2019s greatest athlete, has dipped in prestige since Bruce Jenner won it in 1976.It is about declining attention spans colliding with an event that unfolds sporadically over two days; about ever more air and space occupied by the major team sports. It is about the dearth of major track and field moments in the United States between Olympics, where the glut of medal events means competition for mindshare even at the Games is ever fiercer.It is also about the esoteric nature of the decathlon itself: an early-20th-century tribute to the ancient Greek pentathlon with a mix of running, jumping and throwing events, including the 100 meters, the long jump, the discus and shot-put and the pole vault.\u201cI don\u2019t think it has the reverence from the public that it used to, and I think that\u2019s part of the problem,\u201d said Ato Boldon, a track analyst and former sprinter.Eaton and others agree that there is a lack of understanding of the decathlon\u2019s rigors and particulars. Eaton said that he liked the comedian Bill Murray\u2019s suggestion that they put \u201can average Joe\u201d into every event to provide a frame of reference.For now, ask the average Joe to name the world\u2019s greatest athlete, and the odds are good that he would come up with LeBron James or Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo or even Bolt before coming up with Eaton.\u201cIt all depends what you\u2019re talking about when you say greatest athlete,\u201d said Karl Robert Saluri, a decathlete from Estonia. \u201cIn my view, Ashton is the best all-around athlete.\u201dThat seems a smarter way of phrasing it. Who else has to get so good at so many diverse athletic skills, and then spend four years building to their major moment?Marra, 69, said he would not be coaching the Eatons for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. Eaton, 28, said he put the chances at \u201cless than 50 percent\u201d that he would still be competing in 2020.All the more reason then for coach and pupil to savor the moment Thursday night, even if it had to be savored in the shadow of Bolt.Not that there was bitterness. This was Ashton Eaton, after all.\u201cIt has been a pleasure being in the same era,\u201d Eaton said. \u201cI mean, the guy\u2019s last name is Bolt, and he\u2019s the fastest man ever. You can\u2019t write a story like that, and so to be in the pages in there is nice.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Speeds Toward a Driverless Future, Putting Jobs in Danger", "Date": "2016-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsTravis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s chief executive, has made no secret of wanting to replace its chauffeurs with cars that can ferry passengers without driver input. Uber is not alone. From old-school car and truck manufacturers and parts makers to Silicon Valley interlopers like Tesla, Apple and Alphabet, dozens of companies are racing to develop driverless technology.Along with saving valuable time, fully autonomous vehicles could reduce traffic accidents by 90 percent or more, the Boston Consulting Group has estimated. That would avoid hundreds of billions of dollars in injuries, vehicle damage and lost productivity caused by traffic accidents, which kill more than 30,000 Americans each year.There is a big downside, though. Heavy trucking employs nearly two million people across the United States, with a median salary of over $40,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That is about double what hundreds of thousands of others employed as taxi and limousine drivers make. Both industries are now firmly in Uber\u2019s cross hairs.The jobs might not disappear completely, of course. Moreover, shifting from today\u2019s limited autonomy features like automatic braking and lane correction to truly self-driving vehicles across the country is a huge technology challenge that could take years and draw serious political resistance. Even in a fully autonomous world, freight haulers and livery services would still need mechanics and tech specialists to keep fleets rolling.Still, the threat is clear. And America\u2019s threadbare social safety net and worker-retraining programs may struggle to support a mass retooling of skills. That would heap further pressure on working-class communities already reeling from the loss of more than five million manufacturing jobs over the last two decades.Uber\u2019s new partnerships are the latest sign that the push to driverless is accelerating. Policy makers and politicians should consider themselves forewarned.Advertisement"}
