Tierney, the government antitrust lawyer who oversaw the complaint accusing six major Silicon Valley companies of colluding not to recruit competitors\u2019 employees, is leaving the federal job to join the law firm Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe.The chief of the Justice Department\u2019s networks and technology enforcement section, Mr. Tierney, 62, worked for the government for 26 years. He oversaw all civil antitrust enforcement and competition policy in the areas of computer hardware and software, high technology component manufacturing, financial services, securities industries and professional associations.In the no-poaching case, the government accused Adobe Systems, Apple, Google, Intel, Intuit and Pixar Animation of entering into agreements that blocked the recruiting of each other\u2019s employees. The government argued that such a pact undercut competition among companies vying for employees with advanced or highly specialized skills, and squelched competition among workers \u2014 effectively putting a lid on wages and depriving them of access to better job opportunities.The agreements, overseen by senior executives, had barred companies from \u201ccold calling\u201d a competitor\u2019s workers to make better compensation offers, according to a 2010 settlement.The companies did not admit legal wrongdoing when they signed the settlement, which disallowed practices like the ban on cold calling and which was effective for five years.Mr. Tierney, who has been the networks and technology section head since 2006, will join Orrick\u2019s office in Washington as a partner with an antitrust practice, starting on Aug. 22.

{"Headline": "Why Poets Can Make Better Search Engines", "Date": "2016-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDaniel Nadler spends most of his waking hours running the technology start-up Kensho, which has become a darling of the financial industry, attracting big investments from Goldman Sachs and venture capitalists.But in the mornings and on weekends, Mr. Nadler, 33, writes poetry \u2014 an art he studied while at Harvard, where he was a student of the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Jorie Graham. Mr. Nadler\u2019s first collection, \u201cLacunae: 100 Imagined Ancient Love Poems,\u201d is being published this week by Farrar Straus and Giroux.Mr. Nadler may work with technology, but his book imagines a world before computers and telephones. The unnamed narrators of these love poems live in an unidentified place in a distant mythic past. Jonathan Galassi, Mr. Nadler\u2019s editor at Farrar Straus, said he was drawn to the pared-down, direct nature of the work: \u201cNot many poets today are bold enough to be this simple.\u201dMr. Nadler has developed some rather austere practices for separating his poetry from his job as an entrepreneur. When he is writing he doesn\u2019t check his email, speak or even look in a mirror.But he also says that his work at Kensho \u2014 on what is essentially a search engine for economic events and data \u2014 is deeply informed by his experience as a poet, and vice versa.We talked to Mr. Nadler about his habits, his day job and why poets can make better search engines. Below are edited excerpts from the conversation.When do you write your poetry?I write in the morning.I make a habit of not looking at email and try to make it so I have a period of time in which whatever is going on in the world hasn\u2019t arrived at the threshold of my consciousness yet.Why?Poetry is inseparable from the idea of a voice \u2014 from singing. To isolate what in your voice could be used to sing, or to even speak an utterance that is poetic, you need to have some buffer between the use of your voice as a utilitarian instrument and the use of your voice as a human instrument.I heard that you also avoid looking in mirrors.I never look in a mirror until I am finished writing for the day.My own reflection in a mirror reminds me that I am an organism situated in time, one that once was not here, one that will at some point not be here.That seems like it could be particularly useful in these poems, in which you imagine yourself into a different time.I am writing poetry in which a human being is the character and where what\u2019s common about our humanity is the aspect of the character I am trying to explore. In order to do that, I need to get as far away from what is idiosyncratic about me as a human being as possible.Can you explain the concept behind this volume of poetry?In my mind, I created this idea of ancient poems that in reality have never been written. My project is the same project that I believe Pablo Neruda was pursuing, which was a direct encounter with nature, unburdened by the history of allusion and the history of symbolism, and the history of footnotes.What is the world these characters live in?A world without technology \u2014 a world without the internet \u2014 in a world without complex political and economic structures. In such a time, the most conspicuous thing on the horizon is love.The exploration of that world was the path through which to get back to the basic elemental truths about love and human relationships.It seems a bit odd for a technologist to be writing about a time before technology, no?Artificial intelligence and machine intelligence are about decreasing the length of human perception. Google autocomplete is an attempt to shorten the time and path between thought and a response \u2014 to decrease the time and path between seeing something and categorizing it or identifying it and moving on.To me what poetry in particular is so good at is defamiliarization. Increasing the length of perception. Allowing grown adults to return to the childlike state in which routine experiences, or ordinary objects seem totally strange or foreign.To me that is the role that art in general and poetry specifically must play in the 21st century. As a counterweight to the many things pushing to decrease the length of perception.How do you achieve that yourself?As long as I can remember, I had this odd, almost what I call neurological pathology, where I experienced the parts of things before the whole. I almost went through the world as in an early Picasso or Braque painting with things decomposed, and it would take me a while to see the whole object and it would only come after seeing the parts.I try as hard as I can to retain that wonderful ability. I want to increase the length of perception and recover the sensation of the first perception of a thing. Those are the things I am working at, as a poet and as a human.Why choose poetry as your art form? My generation has grown up through video games and immersive worlds. In a video game your character can see a rock and then just sort of walk around the rock. That\u2019s a very different modality than a movie, which is a totally directed experience.Poetry is the most directly analogous high art form to environments like video games and virtual reality. Poetry is entirely about regulating the pace of your own emotional transportation, and it is the one that is going to be the most native to millennials who have grown up with that idea.Does your poetry complement your day job or distract from it?They are wonderfully synergistic, which is why I never feel myself needing to divide my time.Poetry teaches you how to build a better search engine because it teaches you how to reflect on the needed balance between expectation, utility and serendipity.If a search engine only provides exactly what you are looking for, then it is only as smart or as dumb as you are. We all know from using search engines that a pleasure of life is serendipitous discovery. It\u2019s one of the reasons we like using Wikipedia. As a design principle, that\u2019s a way to build a better search engine.An earlier version of this article misstated the time during which Mr. Nadler studied poetry with Jorie Graham. It was while he was studying for a Ph.D., not during his time as an undergraduate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Think Tank Scholar or Corporate Consultant? It Depends on the Day", "Date": "2016-08-08", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Over the many months that officials in Washington debated sweeping new regulations for internet providers, Jeffrey A. Eisenach, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, was hard to miss.And he has plenty of company.An examination of 75 think tanks found an array of researchers who had simultaneously worked as registered lobbyists, members of corporate boards or outside consultants in litigation and regulatory disputes, with only intermittent disclosure of their dual roles.With their expertise and authority, think tank scholars offer themselves as independent arbiters, playing a vital role in Washington\u2019s political economy. Their imprimatur helps shape government decisions that can be lucrative to corporations.But the examination identified dozens of examples of scholars conducting research at think tanks while corporations were paying them to help shape government policy. Many think tanks also readily confer \u201cnonresident scholar\u201d status on lobbyists, former government officials and others who earn their primary living working for private clients, with few restrictions on such outside work.Largely free from disclosure requirements, the researchers\u2019 work is often woven into elaborate corporate lobbying campaigns.And it is a decidedly bipartisan practice.The overlapping roles are often not made clear, and even members of Congress say they are frequently unaware of the financial ties between industries and the witnesses with think tank titles appearing before them at hearings.\u201cThey can make a very deceptive and false claim to credibility that is totally lacking,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who said he had become increasingly disturbed by the role of think tank experts on Capitol Hill. \u201cI think about it every time there is a witness now from a \u2018think tank,\u2019 putting that term in very boldface quotes.\u201dScholars sometimes include general references to their private-sector work in their official biographies. Mr. Eisenach, for example, notes that he is an executive at NERA Economic Consulting in addition to his position at the American Enterprise Institute. And when a private company pays him or his consulting firm to publish a study, he discloses the name of the corporate sponsor on the study.But there is no way for the public or policy makers to know Mr. Eisenach\u2019s full roster of NERA clients. And there is no comprehensive disclosure of these clients when he writes his think tank reports or academic papers, testifies before Congress, or meets with F.C.C. members or staff.Mr. Eisenach declined repeated requests to comment in detail. But a spokeswoman for the American Enterprise Institute, Judy Mayka Stecker, said she saw no conflict in his roles.\u201cWe believe in the open competition of ideas and encourage our scholars to engage with experts from all sectors and viewpoints,\u201d she said.A footnote on the first page of the letter indicated that none of the scholars who signed had been compensated by stakeholder companies. But of the dozen studies they submitted as evidence, more than half had been funded by telecommunications giants or based on other work for the companies, industry ties that were disclosed only in footnotes in the original studies.No federal rules required broader disclosure. Yet on many highly technical policy issues like telecommunications regulation, scholarship is dominated by industry-funded research, according to a review of hundreds of studies, regulatory filings and other documents.\u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re in legal and you want to have a paper that says what you want it to say,\u201d said Dennis Weller, a former Verizon economist who occasionally consults for telecommunications companies and international organizations. \u201cYou could have a bunch of economists in house and ask them if they agree with you. How much easier would it be to go to an outside economist and say, \u2018How about if I pay you $100,000 to write this?\u2019\u201dFew policy battles have had higher stakes in recent years than the debate over net neutrality \u2014 a catchall term for proposals to restrict internet service providers from blocking websites or regulating speed.To bolster their claims that the regulations would hurt consumers, companies have financed research that contends the rules would reduce investment in new services and raise prices. That work is used to shape the public debate and to build an industry-funded narrative in the regulatory record, one that the F.C.C. is required by law to evaluate.Industry-sponsored research has also figured prominently in court battles over F.C.C. efforts to regulate the internet. When Verizon successfully opposed an earlier F.C.C. rule on net neutrality, more than half of the 23 studies or expert declarations cited in court filings had been sponsored directly by telecommunications companies or trade associations, according to an analysis by The Times. Other studies had been published under the banner of think tanks but written by scholars who consulted extensively for companies.The attacks began to grow particularly heated nearly two years ago, when Mr. Obama called on Mr. Wheeler and his fellow F.C.C. commissioners to regulate the internet like traditional phone lines.The study mentioned their employment at Economists Incorporated, a consulting firm in Washington. But a reader would have had to do more research to learn that Economists Incorporated\u2019s clients included AT&T and Verizon, companies leading the industry\u2019s charge against the commission proposal. That was disclosed on a \u201cselect client list\u201d on the Economists Incorporated website.\u201cPeople who are running advertisements are not going to say, \u2018In a study we paid for,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Litan, now an adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cIn the public discourse, the disclaimers often do get dropped.\u201d\u201cNone of us works for free,\u201d Mr. Singer wrote. \u201cSo let\u2019s focus on the merits & be nice to each other!\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Singer said he \u2014 like most scholars \u2014 disclosed when a client commissioned a particular study published through his consulting firm. Most specialists in the telecommunications field, he suggested, are well aware of his business connections and views on regulatory issues.\u201cEverybody is on different teams,\u201d Mr. Singer said. \u201cSo long as you tell the audience what team you are on, you can then offer the opinions. Disclosure is the antidote to all of this.\u201dFew scholars have been as active in the net neutrality debate as Mr. Eisenach.\u201cJeff is good at linking big theoretical ideas to policy, and he\u2019s been good at making money doing that,\u201d said Mr. Weller, the former Verizon economist. \u201cHe\u2019s been good at moving from think tank to think tank and company to company, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever lost money doing it.\u201dAt a given moment, it can be difficult to determine which hat Mr. Eisenach is wearing.In September 2014, at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on net neutrality, the formal meeting agenda listed Mr. Eisenach as a visiting scholar at the institute.Scholar, consultant, expert witness \u2014 Jeffrey A. Eisenach has worn all these hats while playing a leading role in the debate over telecommunications policy in the United States. Here is a look at the potential conflicts that this situation creates for Mr. Eiensach, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.He then detailed his vehement opposition to further federal regulation of the internet.Mr. Eisenach was similarly ambiguous when he interacted with members of the F.C.C., according to dozens of emails obtained by The Times, all but one of which was sent from Mr. Eisenach\u2019s email address at the American Enterprise Institute.On behalf of the think tank, he sought meetings with F.C.C. commissioners and lawyers to discuss the rules, and briefed the commission\u2019s Republican members on what its general counsel was telling him about Mr. Wheeler\u2019s thinking. Mr. Eisenach offered speaking slots at American Enterprise Institute events to the two Republican members on the commission, urging one to use a January 2015 forum to speak out against the proposed regulations.Ms. Stecker, the institute spokeswoman, said it should be no surprise that the opinions of experts like Mr. Eisenach were in demand. The think tank requires scholars to submit an annual report on any \u201coutside activities,\u201d she added, and A.E.I. has \u201cnot as an institution sought to influence or constrain\u201d this work.While private consulting arrangements can leave scholars\u2019 ties to corporate interests murky, the conflict is more apparent when think tank researchers do double duty as registered lobbyists.Mr. Verdery, a former senior official at the Department of Homeland Security whose office helped run the inspection program at foreign airports, briefly mentioned that in addition to his status as a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, he was the founder of the Monument Policy Group.Officials at the Toronto airport, with Mr. Verdery\u2019s help, have been trying to persuade the American authorities to increase staff and equipment to reduce bottlenecks sometimes created by the preclearance program.Asked whether it was appropriate for a lobbyist to host his clients at a think tank event, Mr. Verdery said, \u201cIt is fairly typical.\u201dMr. Verdery is not paid by the think tank, he noted. He does benefit from the C.S.I.S. title, however, when laying out a client\u2019s case.As of late last year, at least 70 unpaid senior advisers and associates listed on the think tank\u2019s website had simultaneously worked as consultants. Seven others listed as C.S.I.S. senior advisers or associates during the past five years had worked as registered corporate lobbyists while holding the positions.Officials at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, when asked about Mr. Verdery, said his December presentation should not have occurred.\u201cThis event did not meet our standards of transparency and integrity,\u201d the think tank said in a statement in response to questions. \u201cThis constituted a lapse in oversight from C.S.I.S.\u201dMr. Verdery is no longer listed among the think tank\u2019s senior associates.Bruce Bartlett, a scholar who has worked at the Cato Institute and the Heritage Foundation, said it was becoming the norm in Washington for lobbyists and consultants like Mr. Verdery to vie for nonresident scholar posts to help them burnish sales pitches to corporate clients.\u201cClients prefer it that way,\u201d Mr. Bartlett said. \u201cThey get a chance to have their work done by scholars.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think they see any downside,\u201d Mr. Miller said of his corporate clients and the think tank.While Mr. Miller is not well known, he has high-profile company.Mr. Dorgan did not immediately register as a lobbyist, but his firm has oil and gas industry clients.Asked if his dual role represented a conflict of interest, Mr. Dorgan said that the premise of the Bipartisan Policy Center was \u201cto bring interested parties together to find solutions to difficult problems,\u201d and that he was proud to work there.Mr. Zakheim, of the American Enterprise Institute, is also a lobbyist at Covington & Burling L.L.P., where, on behalf of BAE Systems, he is urging Congress and the Defense Department to increase spending on ground combat vehicles that the company manufactures. Other clients include Northrop Grumman, which is building a new long-range Air Force bomber.Some scholars add another twist: They serve on corporate boards directly related to their areas of expertise at think tanks.Dr. McClellan, a former commissioner at the Food and Drug Administration who until January was a senior fellow at Brookings, has been a go-to expert for the federal government as it debates how to cope with surging costs of prescription drugs.At public events, Dr. McClellan emphasized the extraordinary progress by the pharmaceutical industry in coming up with treatments for diseases like diabetes, H.I.V. and hepatitis C.Dr. McClellan, in a statement, disputed any suggestion that he might have had a conflict.\u201cMy entire career in academics, government and public policy has focused on evidence-based ways to improve health and restrain costs for consumers, and my extensive track record speaks for itself,\u201d he said.She said that her change of heart on nuclear power had predated her engagement with Nuclear Matters, and was motivated by her desire to combat climate change, not by payment from the industry.\u201cObviously, the single most important thing any individual has is their reputation,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cI have worked really hard to be forthcoming about what I stand for and believe in. I am who I am.\u201dAdam S. Posen, the president of the Peterson Institute, considered the world\u2019s pre-eminent think tank on global economics, has a commanding view of the construction of the new headquarters for the American Enterprise Institute, as well as the main office of Brookings. In his office, he recently had a series of uncomfortable conversations with three scholars he had decided to let go.After much internal debate, Mr. Posen decided to formally prohibit Peterson\u2019s scholars from holding outside jobs that directly related to the field they wrote about on behalf of the think tank.The three who had such outside engagements were terminated.Mr. Posen noted that the change did not imply the researchers had done anything wrong. But tighter rules are needed, he said, to respond to a growing sense he shares with the Peterson board that the think tank industry must reassert its commitment to impartiality.\u201cI live in a glass house,\u201d said Mr. Posen, a Harvard-trained economist who previously served on the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England, gesturing toward the floor-to-ceiling glass that provides him stunning views.\u201cOur reputation is built on our credibility,\u201d Mr. Posen said. \u201cWithout being perceived as credible and objective, our studies just get thrown on the scrap heap.\u201dThe Urban Institute, a Washington-based think tank that focuses on issues confronting cities, has decided to require that its scholars with any outside jobs detail the relationship in their writings.And at Brookings, executives imposed new rules in December requiring that unpaid nonresident scholars use their title from any paying job, not from Brookings, if they testify before Congress. They are also prohibited from using their affiliation with Brookings in any research report they publish under contract with an outside party.\u201cI\u2019ve moved on to other issues,\u201d Mr. Eisenach said.\u201cIt has gotten to the point where everyone in Washington has their own expert,\u201d Mr. Medvetz said. \u201cIt is yet another reflection of the tremendous influence of economic power in American politics \u2014 as with money, you can create your own vehicles of political influence.\u201dStill, not everyone is worried about the multiple roles played by think tank scholars.\u201cEveryone\u2019s got their point of view,\u201d Mr. Walden said in an interview last year. \u201cAnd some of them get paid to have that point of view.\u201dBrooke Williams is a reporter at the New England Center for Investigative Reporting, which collaborated with The New York Times on this series.

{"Headline": "In the U.S., VW Owners Get Cash. In Europe, They Get Plastic Tubes.", "Date": "2016-08-15", "News": "Supported byThe startling gap in treatment is the result of European laws that shield corporations from class-action suits brought by unhappy consumers. Now a group of online legal start-ups wants to change the status quo.The campaigns are attracting people like J\u00fcrgen Franz, a retired advertising executive in Munich who says his Volkswagen, a diesel Tiguan sport utility vehicle, burns more fuel after a software update that was part of a mandatory recall. He drives the same route every morning and now fills his tank more often.\u201cWhy are they getting so much and we\u2019re getting nothing?\u201d Mr. Franz said of American owners.Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers hope the efforts will signal a turning point in European jurisprudence, opening up a clearer path for aggrieved customers to join forces across borders to sue big corporations. The case could be the largest consumer action of its kind in Europe.Owners\u2019 representatives in Europe are seeking a maximum of 5,000 euros per car, or about $5,600, much less than in the United States. But even that figure could be financially devastating. There are 8.5 million tainted diesels in Europe, compared with about 500,000 in the United States that are covered by the settlement.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.European governments, traditionally deferential to Volkswagen, one of the region\u2019s largest employers, have joined in as well. The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, is coordinating efforts by national consumer groups to collect money from the carmaker. And the German state of Bavaria says it will sue Volkswagen on behalf of its employees\u2019 pension fund, which owns sharply devalued shares in the company.The biggest financial threat may come from new online businesses that have found ways around European obstacles to class-action suits.While laws vary, most European countries do not allow large class actions of the variety that led to the $15 billion settlement in the United States. Nor do many European countries, including Germany, allow lawyers to work on commission, so customers who sue companies risk paying not only their own legal fees but also the other side\u2019s if they lose.That is in contrast to the United States, where it is standard practice for lawyers to collect a hefty percentage of the award if a suit is successful and nothing if it\u2019s not.The start-ups are taking advantage of a loophole that allows European consumers to sign over their legal claims to third-party service providers, which then try to recover damages. And the internet has made it possible to recruit huge numbers of consumers who share similar gripes.People who search Google for the German words for \u201cVolkswagen damage claim\u201d see an ad for the website My-right.de, one of several start-ups using the internet to recruit Volkswagen owners. In Paris, Weclaim.com is attracting French customers. Both websites have teamed up with lawyers and are expanding into other European countries.The companies use technology to automate the laborious task of processing the claims, and usually find investors to finance legal costs in return for a share of the eventual judgment. The result is a de facto class action.\u201cThe model has existed for a long time,\u201d said Sven Bode, managing director of Financialright, the Hamburg-based company that owns My-right.de. \u201cWhat is new is that we can do it on a massive basis.\u201dMr. Bode has previously overseen efforts to help airline passengers obtain compensation for canceled or delayed flights, and to pressure banks to refund improper fees. But because Volkswagen is Europe\u2019s largest carmaker by far, Mr. Bode said, \u201cthis is a unique dimension.\u201dBecause the start-ups are considered collection agencies rather than law firms, they are allowed to work on commission. Clients who sign up agree to pay about a third of any money they collect, similar to contingency fees for lawyers in the United States. The Volkswagen owners owe nothing if the efforts to collect are unsuccessful.About 100,000 Volkswagen owners have registered with My-right.de so far, said Christopher Rother, managing partner of the law firm Hausfeld in Berlin, which is working with the website. The firm\u2019s founder, Michael Hausfeld, who is based in Washington, is one of the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers leading the class action against Volkswagen in the United States.That is only about 5 percent of the eligible owners in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Mr. Rother said the goal was to assemble at least 400,000 customers and collect up to \u20ac5,000 for each one.Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Pelouze, chief executive of Weclaim.com, the Paris-based website that is recruiting owners, said the carmaker was underestimating how vulnerable it was to new legal strategies. \u201cThe rules are changing, and I don\u2019t think Volkswagen is getting it,\u201d Mr. Pelouze said.For now, Volkswagen is standing firm.The American settlement allows owners to sell their cars back to Volkswagen at the pre-scandal price or take the cars in for an emissions upgrade, in addition to a cash payout of up to $10,000. All told, about $10 billion is earmarked for the buybacks, recalls and compensation, or about $20,000 per car.But the company has refused to give European owners any money or to buy back cars, disputing claims that diesels in Europe have lost value. It argues that dealers will be able to bring the cars in line with pollution standards without any decline in performance or fuel economy.Volkswagen has also refused to negotiate with owners\u2019 representatives. \u201cOur view is that there is no legal basis for customer claims,\u201d the company said in a statement.The carmaker has begun recalls in Germany that it plans to replicate in other countries. Vehicle owners will receive the software update and, in some cases, a tubular plastic \u201cflow transformer\u201d designed to improve air flow in the engine and to reduce emissions.That\u2019s it.But as in the United States, many people in Europe bought Volkswagen diesels thinking they were doing something good for the environment, only to learn that the cars emit far more poisonous nitrogen oxides than allowed.Guy Samson, a retired electrician who lives outside Paris, said that his friends gave him a hard time about his diesel Tiguan, and that its resale value had plunged.\u201cPeople, friends, they look at you and they kind of make fun of you behind your back,\u201d Mr. Samson said. \u201cEven to your face sometimes.\u201dMartin de Bourmont contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sydney Morning Herald Faces Uncertain Print Future in Australia", "Date": "2016-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey pushed for women to get the vote in Australia\u2019s national elections. They brought down a central bank board member. And they helped convict a state official.The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and their sister publications at Fairfax Media have been among the most powerful voices in Australia for more than 150 years, shaping public opinion on politics, exposing shady business practices and targeting vast criminal operations. Once mocked as a \u201cGranny\u201d for its cautious, worldly perspective, The Herald long ago embraced the reputation and the nickname.But Fairfax\u2019s newspapers now face a diminished future, with company executives even discussing whether to stop printing The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age on weekdays. If they do, it would signal a new low in the decline of the global newspaper business, the radical retreat of centuries-old, mainstream metropolitan newspapers with national influence.The prospect has dismayed many Australians who wonder what it means for civic life and what it says about the country\u2019s place in the world. Australians consider themselves a highly informed and highly educated society, despite their geographic isolation. And The Herald and Age, with a history of sending correspondents to far-flung locales like the battlefields of Europe and Southeast Asia, have been central to the discourse.The weakening of independent voices like The Herald also leaves the Australian market increasingly dominated by the partisan agenda of News Corporation, which owns the country\u2019s top three newspapers by weekday circulation. The struggles at Fairfax represent an especially satisfying victory for News Corporation, run by the homegrown billionaire Rupert Murdoch, who turned his family\u2019s original asset \u2014 a single provincial Australian newspaper \u2014 into a global media empire. Although News Corporation has faced its own financial strains, its other successful businesses, like a real estate website, have provided better support for its journalistic operations.Trouble at Fairfax Media \u201cconstitutes a crisis in civic journalism in our country, because the resources will no longer be there,\u201d said Eric Beecher, a former top editor at The Herald and at News Corporation who is now the publisher of Crikey, a news website. \u201cThe Age and The Sydney Morning Herald have always done the heavy lifting of civic journalism and investigative journalism.\u201dEven by the newspaper industry\u2019s standards, readers of Australia\u2019s print newspapers have been declining at an unusually rapid rate.The chief executive for Fairfax Media, Greg Hywood, said the company had not made a decision whether to halt weekday printing, although it was under review. If printing is halted, he said, the company\u2019s journalistic approach would not be affected.\u201cOur readers have never been hungrier for good-quality news reporting,\u201d Mr. Hywood said.When The Herald opened its state-of-the-art, $260 million presses in 1995, the newspaper\u2019s Saturday edition was a hefty 400 pages. The company predicted it would easily grow to 600 pages.After all, The Herald and the rest of the Fairfax Media papers had practically cornered the market in Sydney and Melbourne for classified advertising for cars, jobs and real estate. Those so-called rivers of gold helped support a robust reporting operation.\u201cWe wondered how on earth we would print a paper that size,\u201d said Mr. Hywood, who was once the Washington correspondent for another Fairfax newspaper, The Australian Financial Review.It was also the same year that Fairfax started its first digital news site, in retrospect, roughly the peak for the print business.The Saturday edition has now shrunk to around 200 pages. Fairfax has cut more than 500 jobs at city newspapers over the last five years, including 100 in April, according to Australia\u2019s union for journalists. And last year The Herald\u2019s cherished printing presses were sold for $34 million.The headwinds now buffeting The Herald and Age are global, as the internet erodes the protections once afforded by geography. There\u2019s the ubiquitous competition from Facebook and Google. Digital native publications like BuzzFeed and The Huffington Post each have small Australian newsrooms without the sizable costs of legacy papers like The Herald.The \u201crivers of gold\u201d have evaporated. Advertising and subscriptions have particularly wilted on weekdays; weekends now represent two-thirds of the revenues at Fairfax\u2019s major newspapers.In the sign of the depths of the print problems, the company this month wrote off much of its investment in the newspapers. Fairfax\u2019s main saving grace has been its fast-growing real estate website, Domain, which has helped offset the losses.Such industry challenges forced papers in some large American cities to rethink their print presence years ago. The Times-Picayune of New Orleans cut printing to three days a week, while The Seattle Post-Intelligencer is online only. Facing cutthroat competition in the crowded British market, The Independent in London, which started in the 1980s to shake up the media establishment, went digital this year.Some of The Herald\u2019s wounds were self-inflicted.As the dot-com boom took off and media companies moved online, Fairfax separated its digital operations, in the hope of eventually taking the group public. At The Herald, there were two newsrooms, one for the newspaper and one for the web.The division created a rift. A younger online staff chased clicks, loading the site up with gossip-fueled content, heavy on sex, celebrity and crime. It rankled more seasoned veterans in the print newsroom, who lamented the shift away from weightier topics like the domestic economy and global politics.\u201cIt was viewed that online there was a lot more Paris Hilton than Paris, France, and that to win online you needed to be a tabloid newspaper,\u201d said Mark Scott, a former Fairfax executive who most recently served as chief executive of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. \u201cThe Herald\u2019s strength had always been its great quality, broadsheet traditions.\u201dThe newsrooms were eventually merged and the website now takes a somewhat more balanced approach. But stories about Kylie Jenner\u2019s Vogue cover and the abs of Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, are still intermingled online with more hard-hitting newspaper articles about the terror links in a child care fraud and the serious flaws in the country\u2019s census.Like many media operations, Fairfax is trying to strike a difficult balance. The meatier topics may play well to the newspaper audience, generally an older crowd. But Mr. Hywood, the Fairfax chief, said that online readers, who skew younger, want a broader mix.In terms of readers, the digital strategy appears to be clicking. The Herald is the nation\u2019s leading website, by the number of paying subscribers.\u201cThat can be criticized by people who prefer highbrow content,\u201d said Megan Brownlow, an executive director in the Sydney offices of PricewaterhouseCoopers, the consulting firm. \u201cBut when you\u2019re in a numbers game like internet advertising, highbrow content is hard to monetize.\u201dEven so, it strikes a nerve within the newsroom, which worries about losing its voice within Australian society.The ranks of The Herald, like so many newspapers around the world, have been decimated by cuts over the years. Reporters have gone on strike, deriding the rounds of job losses.Some losses have cut to the core. Four years ago, 70 journalists were laid off within one week. Gone were the urban affairs editor, a senior political correspondent, a specialist feature writer, a senior business reporter, the health editor, arts editor and senior crime reporter.Mr. Hywood denies that reporters are now thin on the ground. Fairfax plans to use the profits from non-news properties, like Domain and a television streaming service, Stan, to promote and support the company\u2019s journalism.But the financial picture at the newspapers continues to deteriorate, forcing Fairfax to contemplate the once-unthinkable. If The Herald drastically cuts its publication schedule, the fear inside and outside the newsroom is that the journalistic endeavors will suffer.Kate McClymont, 58, has been breaking news at The Sydney Morning Herald for decades. One of the newspaper\u2019s marquee journalists, Ms. McClymont appears in the paper\u2019s ads.\u201cWe have been holding the powerful in this city to account for a long time,\u201d Ms. McClymont said.Most recently, she pursued a state government minister, Eddie Obeid, uncovering how his private businesses were improperly benefiting from his public role. Mr. Obeid was found guilty in June of misusing his public office. He will soon face a second court case over mining leases he obtained from the state government.\u201cWe have shone a light where crooks would prefer places remained dark,\u201d Ms. McClymont said. \u201cI hate the idea of people getting away with anything.\u201d\u201cIt is bad for democracy,\u201d she added, \u201cif this voice is diminished in any way.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The country is on the wrong track. We\u2019re getting our clocks cleaned in global trade deals. We\u2019re still suffering from the humiliation of Iraq.The share of Americans who say that democracy is a \u201cfairly bad\u201d or \u201cvery bad\u201d system of government is rising sharply. A quarter of young Americans feel that way, according to data drawn from the World Values Survey. A majority of young Americans believe that the United States should stay out of world affairs, according to a Chicago Council on Global Affairs report.Yet when you watch the Olympics, we don\u2019t seem like some sad-sack country in terminal decline. If anything, the coverage gets a little boring because we\u2019re always winning! And the winners have such amazingly American stories and personality types (Biles, Ledecky, and, yes, Lochte).American Olympic performance has been astoundingly consistent over the recent decades. With rare exception, we can be counted on to win between 101 and 110 medals Olympiad after Olympiad. The 2016 team seems on pace to win at least that many.We\u2019re not great when measured by medals per capita (New Zealand, Denmark, Hungary, Australia and Britain are the big winners there), but America does have more medals than any other nation in history, and that lead is widening.Moreover, America doesn\u2019t win because we have better athletes (talent must be distributed equally). America does well because it has such great systems for preparing athletes. Medals are won by institutions as much as by individuals. The Germans have a great system for training kayakers, equestrians and throwers \u2014 the discus or javelin. The U.S. has amazing institutions to prepare jumpers, swimmers, basketball players, gymnasts, runners and decathletes.The big question is: Is the greatness of America\u2019s sports institutions reflective of the country\u2019s strong institutions generally, or is it more like the Soviet Union\u2019s sports greatness, a Potemkin show masking national rot?Well, if you step outside the pall of the angry campaign rhetoric, you see that America\u2019s institutions are generally quite strong. Over the past decades, some developing countries, like Brazil, India and China, posted glitzy economic growth numbers. But those countries are now all being hampered by institutional weakness and growth is plummeting.But America\u2019s economic success is like our Olympic success, writ large. The nation\u2019s troubles are evident, but our country has sound fundamentals. The American dollar is by far the world\u2019s currency. The Food and Drug Administration is the benchmark for medical standards. The American patent system is the most important in the world.Nine of Forbes\u2019s 10 most valuable brands are American (Apple, Google, IBM and so on). The U.S. is the leading energy producer. We have 15 (at least!) of the world\u2019s top 20 universities, while Hollywood is as dominant as ever.America is also quite good at change. The median age in the U.S. is 37.8, compared with 46.5 for both Germany and Japan. The newer a technology is the more the U.S. is likely to dominate it \u2014 whether it\u2019s the cloud or the sharing economy. According to The Economist, 91 percent of online searches are done through American companies\u2019 services, and 99 percent of smartphones run on American-made operating systems.Some American industries have declined, but others are rising. American fund managers handle 55 percent of the world\u2019s assets. American businesses host 61 percent of the world\u2019s social media users.On the campaign circuit, global trade is portrayed as this great national disaster. We\u2019re being destroyed by foreigners! The Trans-Pacific Partnership was the central dominating boogeyman at the Democratic National Convention, especially among people who have no clue what\u2019s in it.In fact, America succeeds in global trade about as well as at the Olympics. We rank third, behind Switzerland and Singapore, in global competitive rankings put out by the World Economic Forum. When trade is leveled by international agreements, American firms take advantage and win customers.Over the past five years, Zoellick wrote, the U.S. has run a $320 billion trade surplus in manufactured goods with its free-trade partners. The country\u2019s farmers and ranchers boosted exports to free-trade partners by 130 percent between 2003 and 2013.In one important way sports is not like economics. In Rio there are only three medals in each event. Global trade is not zero-sum. It spreads vast benefits across societies, while undeniably hurting some businesses in narrow fields along the way.Of course, we have to take care of those who are hurt, but the biggest threat now is unmerited pessimism itself, and the stupid and fearful choices that inevitably flow from it.Advertisement"}

His grandparents were mainstays of the Yiddish theater, at times performing from the Sholom Aleichem stories that became \u201cFiddler on the Roof.\u201dTalk about tradition.Herschel Bernardi played Tevye, a cash-poor but faith-rich Jewish milkman with five daughters living in czarist Russia, more than 700 times on Broadway and several hundred more times on the road; he was nominated for a Tony Award for playing the role in a 1981 Broadway revival. While his son plays the show\u2019s innkeeper \u2014 a minor role \u2014 in the revival, which opened last year, he is also one of two Tevye understudies, and at Wednesday\u2019s matinee he will step in for the show\u2019s star, Danny Burstein.As in every performance, Mr. Bernardi will be wearing his father\u2019s brown leather Tevye boots.\u201cIt\u2019s taken me a long time to really process what all of this means,\u201d Mr. Bernardi said during an interview in his shared fifth-floor dressing room at the Broadway Theater, where there are costume sketches, pictures of Jews in shtetls and a keep-it-real note to himself (\u201cMordcha didn\u2019t go to acting school\u201d), but no photos of his father. \u201cThere are certain times when it\u2019s like: \u2018Am I a guinea pig in some scientific, psychological journal right now? What is going on?\u2019\u201dThe younger Mr. Bernardi started performing publicly at age 8, doing stand-up comedy in Los Angeles, where he grew up. In high school he discovered a passion for plays \u2014 he says he preferred them to musicals as he tried to find his own way in the theater. He studied acting at the State University of New York, Purchase.He had to be persuaded. \u201cI had this moment where I could feel the fear,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like: \u2018Oh, God, that\u2019s the ring of fire, to play the role that your father was famous for. Oh, God. Comparison, comparison, comparison.\u2019 But I knew I had to do it.\u201dThat production\u2019s director, Ron Fassler, is also an actor; he said he was certain the younger Mr. Bernardi could play Tevye. \u201cI knew it was inside him, but he was tentative, and it scared him a little,\u201d Mr. Fassler said, recalling an evening, just before opening, when Mr. Bernardi burst into tears after a rehearsal, overwhelmed by the experience.Mr. Bernardi, who wore his father\u2019s jacket, vest, cap and shirt through that summer run, was not the only one who felt the connection: One night, a couple approached him after the performance, offering him the Playbill from a \u201cFiddler\u201d performance starring his father that they had attended on their first date more than four decades earlier.While performing in Massachusetts, Mr. Bernardi sent in an audition tape for the Broadway revival; he heard nothing back, but went to New York to introduce himself to the casting directors. Ultimately, he got the role of Mordcha and has been in the show since it began performances last November.\u201cIn the beginning, honestly, I felt like I was doing a s\u00e9ance,\u201d Mr. Bernardi said. \u201c\u2018Fiddler\u2019 already conjures up so many images of people\u2019s histories, of their immigrant parents \u2014 when you go to the stage door, people say, \u2018It was like I was watching my grandparents rise from the floor.\u2019\u201dMr. Bernardi said he shared that sentiment but has to move past it.\u201cTo do the job, and to tell the story, I can\u2019t live there,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve really had to make a concerted effort to know what Mordcha knows, to know what Tevye knows, and to live their story \u2014 and I can trust that my story is there.\u201dAnd his story is inextricably bound up with \u201cFiddler.\u201d In utero, his mother says, he would kick when his father would sing; his father turned to \u201cFiddler\u201d material to calm his mother while she was delivering him via emergency C-section. In the years after his father\u2019s death, the younger Mr. Bernardi would listen to \u201cAn Evening With Herschel Bernardi,\u201d an album of live performances of folk songs and stories. (The cover image: his father\u2019s face inside a bagel.) And, in the age of Google and YouTube, the younger Mr. Bernardi has been able to watch performances by his father online.\u201cHe was a kid that really missed having a father, and he asked a lot of questions about him,\u201d said his mother, Teri Bernardi. \u201cThe only way I could connect him to his father, when he did ask, was to tell him stories his father had told me.\u201dMr. Bernardi said that being in the revival had \u201cprovided me with the fatherly lessons that I\u2019ve craved for over 30 years and never got.\u201d And, he said, he could feel his dad\u2019s presence.\u201cOnce in a blue moon, I\u2019ll be sitting alone, maybe having an issue, and I just let it get real quiet, and connect,\u201d he said. \u201cListen, I believe in science, and science hasn\u2019t really proven anything when it comes to the afterlife, and so I can accept that the voice that I hear back is a part of my own brain. But I know that it is a part of my brain that\u2019s the best father that could possibly be.\u201dHe is scheduled to play Tevye for just that one performance, and acknowledges that he has no idea how it will go, or what he will do after the revival closes on Dec. 31. But he has invited his mother, his father\u2019s children from his first marriage and other relatives and friends, determined to share the moment.\u201cRegardless of if I fall into the orchestra pit, it\u2019s going to be an incredible sense of pride to know that I stood on the Broadway stage and played Tevye,\u201d he said.\u201cThe stories of Sholom Aleichem, and \u2018Fiddler on the Roof\u2019, have put food on my family\u2019s table for generations,\u201d he added. \u201cEven if I never sang one note of \u2018Fiddler,\u2019 this show is responsible for my survival \u2014 it\u2019s responsible for my life.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "When Every Company Is a Tech Company, Does the Label Matter?", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesApple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon have created something of a watershed moment in the stock market.They became the four most valuable companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index at the close of trading on Aug. 1, according to S.&P.\u2019s official tally. That meant that tech companies, by one common definition, occupied the four top spots in the market capitalization rankings, a rare and brief occurrence.\u201cIt may never have happened before at the close of trading,\u201d said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. The full history of daily rankings isn\u2019t readily available, however, so we can\u2019t be certain, and such rankings are evanescent, shifting with every tick of the stock market. In fact, on Friday, Amazon dropped back into sixth place.But no matter: The early August rankings were a reminder of how far tech has come. It is a dominant force in the stock market and the economy, one so all-encompassing that tech may no longer even be a useful concept for understanding today\u2019s stock market.One of them is Exxon Mobil, the energy giant and the most valuable company in the S.&P. as recently as 2012. But Exxon Mobil has been cut down in size by the oil price debacle. The other is Berkshire Hathaway, Warren E. Buffett\u2019s conglomerate, which the S.&P. categorizes as a financial services company \u2014 the only such company left in the Top 10 market cap list. Berkshire announced its own earnings after trading closed on Friday. We\u2019ll soon learn whether the market is pleased enough to vault Berkshire further ahead of Amazon.The three tech companies at the very top in market cap \u2014 Apple, Google and Microsoft \u2014 have held high positions for a long while. (Google, ranked second, trades as Alphabet, the name of its parent company.) Google passed Apple in value briefly this year, but Apple regained the top perch, which it has held since 2012. Microsoft, now No. 3, was the most valuable company during the last tech boom, in the early 2000s.Virtually no one disputes S.&P.\u2019s formal classification of Apple, Google and Microsoft as \u201cinformation technology\u201d companies. The same is true of Facebook, which held seventh place in the latest list of most valuable companies. But while Amazon is often described as a tech company \u2014 and undoubtedly uses and creates innovative technology \u2014 S.&P. has never classified it as one.In fact, Amazon is formally known as a \u201cconsumer discretionary company,\u201d like Walmart, which it has displaced as a member of the Top 10 most valuable companies. Amazon is the only consumer discretionary company left in the Top 10. Is it in some sense a tech company? Certainly, and we\u2019ll get back to that.But the same can be said, to one degree or another, about the three other members of the Top 10 \u2014 old companies that are still prospering in large part because of their mastery of advanced technologies. Johnson & Johnson, for example, which is ranked eighth, is a health care company, yet it is heavily involved in technology of a biological kind. Then there is General Electric, the diversified industrial company (and, until recently, also a financial services company), once described as a bellwether for the entire market. It conducts advanced research and sells tech products.Last on the list is AT&T, a telecommunications company, which, in an early form, helped create computer languages and operating systems on which modern tech companies are built. In 1957, when the S.&P. 500 was born, an ancestral version of AT&T was the most valuable company in the United States by a very wide margin, said Jeremy J. Siegel, a Wharton business school professor, the author of \u201cStocks for the Long Run\u201d and a market historian.\u201cAT&T back then was a highly regulated old phone company,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a giant, later broken up into smaller companies. And it was an outlier, because the other big companies in the S.&P. 500 in that era were mainly materials companies \u2014 like United States Steel, DuPont and Union Carbide \u2014 and an awful lot of oil companies.\u201dIn 1957, the economy ran on oil, and the biggest energy company was Standard Oil of New Jersey \u2014 an ancestor of Exxon Mobil. No pure tech company ranked in the Top 10 back then, not even IBM, which soon became the dominant tech company, a position it held until Microsoft surpassed it in the mid-1990s. That was the decade of the great tech boom, culminating in the bubble that burst in March 2000. Microsoft was No. 1 in market cap at the end of 1999, and four other tech companies \u2014 Cisco Systems, Intel, IBM and America Online \u2014 were also among the Top 10 most valuable companies. The stock market celebrated tech\u2019s ascendance then, as it does now.But this is a different era. When you dig deeper into the S.&P. 500, it\u2019s clear that while the valuations of tech companies swelled to unrealistically high proportions in those bubble years, the valuations of most companies are far more modest now. In March 2000, the height of the bubble, the value of information technology companies swelled to 34.5 percent of the total market cap of the S.&P. 500. At the moment, the comparable figure is only 20.7 percent, data from the Bespoke Investment Group shows. That\u2019s not much more than the 15.7 percent share of financial companies or the 15.2 percent share of the health care sector. By contrast, finance ballooned as high as 22.3 percent at the end of 2006, in what can be seen in hindsight as a financial bubble.On the other hand, materials and energy companies, which together constituted almost half of the total value of the S.&P. 500 in 1957, now account for less than 10 percent of it. That reflects the collapse of energy and commodity prices over the last few years, and it may well be a temporary phenomenon. In the meantime, diversified energy companies like Exxon Mobil are investing heavily in technology, a necessity if they are to flourish.It\u2019s clear even to energy companies, in other words, that tech\u2019s abiding power in the marketplace is not temporary. Technology permeates every sector of the economy, even those not formally classified as high-tech. Whether companies like Amazon and Johnson & Johnson should carry tech labels is beside the point. Tech has already taken over.These days every company is a tech company, but some have better niches, faster growth, more attractive offerings or more favorable share prices than others. These kinds of fundamental distinctions will influence the Top 10 rankings of the future.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is Our Country as Good as Our Athletes Are?", "Date": "2016-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPessimism has flavored this election campaign. America is in decline. The country is on the wrong track. We\u2019re getting our clocks cleaned in global trade deals. We\u2019re still suffering from the humiliation of Iraq.The share of Americans who say that democracy is a \u201cfairly bad\u201d or \u201cvery bad\u201d system of government is rising sharply. A quarter of young Americans feel that way, according to data drawn from the World Values Survey. A majority of young Americans believe that the United States should stay out of world affairs, according to a Chicago Council on Global Affairs report.Yet when you watch the Olympics, we don\u2019t seem like some sad-sack country in terminal decline. If anything, the coverage gets a little boring because we\u2019re always winning! And the winners have such amazingly American stories and personality types (Biles, Ledecky, and, yes, Lochte).American Olympic performance has been astoundingly consistent over the recent decades. With rare exception, we can be counted on to win between 101 and 110 medals Olympiad after Olympiad. The 2016 team seems on pace to win at least that many.We\u2019re not great when measured by medals per capita (New Zealand, Denmark, Hungary, Australia and Britain are the big winners there), but America does have more medals than any other nation in history, and that lead is widening.Moreover, America doesn\u2019t win because we have better athletes (talent must be distributed equally). America does well because it has such great systems for preparing athletes. Medals are won by institutions as much as by individuals. The Germans have a great system for training kayakers, equestrians and throwers \u2014 the discus or javelin. The U.S. has amazing institutions to prepare jumpers, swimmers, basketball players, gymnasts, runners and decathletes.The big question is: Is the greatness of America\u2019s sports institutions reflective of the country\u2019s strong institutions generally, or is it more like the Soviet Union\u2019s sports greatness, a Potemkin show masking national rot?Well, if you step outside the pall of the angry campaign rhetoric, you see that America\u2019s institutions are generally quite strong. Over the past decades, some developing countries, like Brazil, India and China, posted glitzy economic growth numbers. But those countries are now all being hampered by institutional weakness and growth is plummeting.But America\u2019s economic success is like our Olympic success, writ large. The nation\u2019s troubles are evident, but our country has sound fundamentals. The American dollar is by far the world\u2019s currency. The Food and Drug Administration is the benchmark for medical standards. The American patent system is the most important in the world.Nine of Forbes\u2019s 10 most valuable brands are American (Apple, Google, IBM and so on). The U.S. is the leading energy producer. We have 15 (at least!) of the world\u2019s top 20 universities, while Hollywood is as dominant as ever.America is also quite good at change. The median age in the U.S. is 37.8, compared with 46.5 for both Germany and Japan. The newer a technology is the more the U.S. is likely to dominate it \u2014 whether it\u2019s the cloud or the sharing economy. According to The Economist, 91 percent of online searches are done through American companies\u2019 services, and 99 percent of smartphones run on American-made operating systems.Some American industries have declined, but others are rising. American fund managers handle 55 percent of the world\u2019s assets. American businesses host 61 percent of the world\u2019s social media users.On the campaign circuit, global trade is portrayed as this great national disaster. We\u2019re being destroyed by foreigners! The Trans-Pacific Partnership was the central dominating boogeyman at the Democratic National Convention, especially among people who have no clue what\u2019s in it.In fact, America succeeds in global trade about as well as at the Olympics. We rank third, behind Switzerland and Singapore, in global competitive rankings put out by the World Economic Forum. When trade is leveled by international agreements, American firms take advantage and win customers.Over the past five years, Zoellick wrote, the U.S. has run a $320 billion trade surplus in manufactured goods with its free-trade partners. The country\u2019s farmers and ranchers boosted exports to free-trade partners by 130 percent between 2003 and 2013.In one important way sports is not like economics. In Rio there are only three medals in each event. Global trade is not zero-sum. It spreads vast benefits across societies, while undeniably hurting some businesses in narrow fields along the way.Of course, we have to take care of those who are hurt, but the biggest threat now is unmerited pessimism itself, and the stupid and fearful choices that inevitably flow from it.Advertisement"}

No, we\u2019re not talking about dropping the Wall Street bull\u2019s testicles on to the floor of Congress, though that was how clever editing made it look last week. Rather, Darlene and her core crew \u2014 the nebbish Mobley, who\u2019s ready to run; the more cautious Trenton, who has her Iranian immigrant family to consider; and Darlene\u2019s ex-boyfriend Cisco, their link to the fearsome Dark Army \u2014 record and broadcast a conference call about the F.B.I.\u2019s \u201cOperation Berenstain,\u201d which is warrantlessly monitoring the communications of millions of Americans to hunt for the hack\u2019s perpetrators.\u201cBackdoor access to every smartphone,\u201d a list of cooperating companies that includes \u201cGoogle, AT&T, Uber, Apple, Verizon, Facebook\u201d: This wholesale collusion between the state and corporations to violate privacy is so grimly plausible it barely qualifies as fiction, even before footage of Edward Snowden is repurposed to comment on the scandal.Yet Darlene\u2019s rhetoric in the broadcast, alarmingly violent even by the standards of a group that uses a slasher\u2019s mask as its sigil, is an early indication that the group is feeling desperate. She refers to the government\u2019s \u201ctyrannical rape of our private data,\u201d a disturbing choice of words given fsociety\u2019s collaboration with Julian Assange\u2019s WikiLeaks and its own less than stellar track record with both rape and private data.\u201cWe will destroy you!\u201d she barks at the feds, once again adopting \u201cwar on terror\u201d verbiage \u2014 not a promising route to success. So when the E Corp lawyer Susan Jacobs, a.k.a. Madame Executioner, has her \u201csmart home\u201d unexpectedly commandeered as the group\u2019s headquarters, what befalls her has a nauseating air of inevitability to it.Not that Jacobs comes across as anything but awful during her too-brief stint as the group\u2019s hostage. She goads Trenton about her Muslim faith in an attempt to escape: \u201cIs that what this is about? ISIS or something?\u201d And proceeding to call them a bunch of animals.It does her no good, though, since the moment she slips loose she tries to attack Trenton and winds up banging her head on the wall, knocking herself out. Realizing she\u2019ll need medical care, the frightened foursome frantically search her personal accounts for information with which to blackmail her before they take her to a hospital, and discover that she\u2019s been sleeping with judges in exchange for more favorable verdicts. As their leader, Darlene volunteers to confront Jacobs with their discovery \u2014 but instead tazes her and leaves her to drown in her swimming pool, committing a murder that had been on her mind ever since she was 4 years old and saw Jacobs laughing about the case that killed her and Elliot\u2019s father.From there, things manage to get even uglier, somehow. Darlene and Cisco take Jacobs\u2019s body to the pet crematory they use to dispose of evidence, and are forced to remove her body from the suitcase they\u2019d packed it in and jam it directly into the oven. Mobley and Trenton return home, looking over their shoulders, jumping at every sound \u2014 jittery editing and sudden crash cuts heighten the sense of fear. Sure enough, Mobley is arrested by Dom DiPierro, but she has no idea how high up he is, suspecting him merely of being the D.J. at fsociety\u2019s party the night of the hack. Her superior forces her to let him go in light of the bad press that the bureau is already receiving. He signals to Trenton that they\u2019ve been burned and have to flee, but never shows up at their designated meeting place. Darlene, meanwhile, sleeps at Cisco\u2019s place, and awakens to discover that he\u2019s reporting on her to the Dark Army; the episode ends when she smashes his laptop, then hits him in the head with a baseball bat.Even the relatively tangential Angela has a terrible time of things. She has an ugly confrontation with one of her father\u2019s working-class friends; he hits her with crude sexual insults, she responds with classist cheap shots. She sings a joyless rendition of Tears for Fears\u2019 \u201cEverybody Wants to Rule the World\u201d at karaoke, then ditches her boyfriend for an older man of dubious intent played by Mark Moses (Duck Phillips of \u201cMad Men\u201d). This, perhaps, is for the best, since said boyfriend was an undercover F.B.I. agent, but even so \u2014 just ask Peggy Olson how dating Duck Phillips turned out.But in Elliot\u2019s absence, the episode\u2019s true star is the composer Mac Quayle\u2019s score. The show\u2019s usual electronic hum is complemented, and at times supplanted, by screeching strings and dissonant jolts straight out of a horror film. Which, of course, is what the episode really is: a monster movie, if only in the Nietzschean sense. Darlene has dedicated her life to fighting monsters, and now she\u2019s become one herself. Emerging from an hour of television this expertly discomfiting feels like bursting free of a haunted house.Advertisement"}

I think this will expose a lot more social and cultural problems than technical ones \u2014 and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how Uber addresses them.Personally, I\u2019d be thrilled to be driven around by a computer. Computers are my friends.Anyway, see you next week.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Middle-Income Jobs Finally Show Signs of a Rebound", "Date": "2016-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe American economy is finally creating more middle-income jobs, according to a new analysis released Thursday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in a turnabout from the feast-and-famine pattern earlier in the recovery, when hiring was strongest at the bottom and top of the wage scale.The findings suggest that it may soon be time to retire a familiar criticism of the long but lackluster economic rebound that has been underway since the end of the Great Recession in 2009: the hollowing out of the American middle class.Between 2013 and 2015, employers added nearly 2.3 million workers earning from $30,000 to $60,000 a year, primarily in fields like education, construction, transportation and social services. That was roughly 50 percent more than in either the high-wage or low-wage categories during the same period.By contrast, the Fed researchers found, of the nearly 7.6 million jobs created from 2010 to 2013, only about a fifth fell into the middle-tier category, with the largest number instead coming from lower-paid sectors like food preparation and health care support.\u201cThe tide has begun to turn,\u201d said William C. Dudley, president of the New York Fed. \u201cFor the first time in quite a while, we are seeing gains in middle-wage jobs actually outnumber gains in higher- and lower-wage jobs nationwide.\u201dAlthough the economy has created nearly 15 million jobs since employment bottomed out in early 2010, the gains in the recovery have been noticeably uneven. While many cities along the East and West Coasts have been prolific job creators, parts of the Midwest and South have not experienced similar improvements.At the same time, most American workers have made only paltry wage gains until recently, despite steady hiring that has helped bring the national unemployment rate down to 4.9 percent last month from a high of 10 percent in late 2009.\u201cIt\u2019s important, but we are coming off of a really low threshold,\u201d said Diane Swonk, a veteran independent economist based in Chicago, referring to the new Fed study. \u201cWe\u2019ve shifted gears, but we\u2019re only now beginning to regain the quality in terms of jobs.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve got a long way to go,\u201d Ms. Swonk added, noting that after inflation, family incomes were still below where they were in 2000. \u201cIt\u2019s more than a lost decade.\u201dThe nascent national improvement identified by the Fed researchers in New York also held true in the metropolitan region in recent years, with New York City and surrounding suburbs adding 179,000 middle-wage jobs from 2013 to 2015, compared with just 18,000 from 2010 to 2013.The shift coincided with the passing of the baton from finance to technology as the major driver in local job creation.More than any area in the United States, with the possible exception of San Francisco, New York City has come to symbolize an economy built on vast gains for a lucky few, with most everyone else largely standing still.But as the motor of New York\u2019s economy, Wall Street is yielding to Silicon Alley and Brooklyn, as technology companies like Google and smaller start-ups bulk up while banks and hedge funds slim down.Since 2010, tech employment in New York City has jumped by 53,000, while securities industry jobs have increased by just 12,000.In fact, with 172,400 workers in 2015, employment in the New York securities industry remains well short of where it peaked before the financial crisis. There were more than 125,000 tech workers in New York City last year, nearly double the total a decade ago.\u201cIn the past, the city has counted on job growth from Wall Street to fuel economic growth during recoveries and expansions,\u201d Mr. Dudley said. \u201cThis time around, however, job gains in the securities industry have been quite meager.\u201dHiring in fields like internet publishing, online shopping and scientific research and development, Mr. Dudley added, \u201cis picking up much of the slack created by the softness of the securities industry.\u201dThe local tech boom has also spread the largess well beyond the canyons of Wall Street. Private sector job growth in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx was stronger last year than it was in Manhattan.While technology companies are still mostly based in Manhattan, Brooklyn has benefited from what economists call a multiplier effect, as young tech workers move to the borough in search of more affordable housing and patronize restaurants, clubs and other services there.The South Bronx, once synonymous with urban decay, is also on an upswing, especially around the markets in the Hunts Point area, said Jason Bram, a researcher with the New York Fed. Queens has benefited from its proximity to local airports.Suburban counties like Rockland, Westchester and Nassau are also prospering again, and closer-in counties in New Jersey, like Bergen, Essex, Middlesex and Monmouth, are finally showing signs of life.Still, large parts of upstate New York, including Binghamton, Elmira and Syracuse, are struggling economically. Ithaca and Albany have been exceptions upstate, paced by gains in education and emerging fields like nanotechnology.There\u2019s plenty of need for further improvement, Mr. Dudley said, but he suggested that the increase in middle-class jobs since 2013 may mark a turning point in the recovery.\u201cThis is an important development in the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it were to continue, it would create more opportunities for workers and their families who have been struggling up to now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Pinterest Follows Rivals Into Selling Video Ads", "Date": "2016-08-17", "News": "Supported byPinterest is finally taking the plunge that many other tech companies already have: It has started selling video advertising.Video ads from brands like Kate Spade and bareMinerals will start appearing in the virtual scrapbook-like Pinterest feed on Wednesday and into the coming weeks, and Pinterest is hopeful that ads from other brands will soon follow.The new ads will show up in a silent, GIF-like format within Pinterest\u2019s feed, and will play with sound once clicked. Users will be able to click images, or pins, of featured products next to the videos. That could, for instance, bring them to a brand\u2019s website or allow them to buy the product without leaving Pinterest.The move puts the social-bookmarking site in competition with the likes of Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat, as well as large digital publishers, which are all vying for the increasingly large amounts of marketers\u2019 digital ad dollars.Last year, Etsy was the website with the greatest number of links from Pinterest\u2019s Save button.

What you\u2019re going to see going forward is a very big investment in video.\u201dPinterest will most likely benefit from some brands that are turning away from TV, he said.BareMinerals, a makeup brand, will promote a new foundation on Pinterest with a video tutorial.

That viewership is going down, ratings are going down, and they need to find places to accomplish their business objectives where people are spending their actual time.\u201dMs. Boston added: \u201cWhile it does have TV, we are investing more of a percentage of our marketing budget in digital and mobile because that\u2019s where the millennial is spending her time.

{"Headline": "Raves for New Grandstand, but Old One Has Its Fans", "Date": "2016-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by8 PhotosWhen Dan Wiley heard that Caroline Wozniacki was playing Taylor Townsend in a first-round United States Open match at the Grandstand, he did what he had done many times before to get there: He passed through the walkway that connects Louis Armstrong Stadium to the adjacent court.But once there, Wiley, a 53-year-old community coordinator for Representative Nydia M. Vel\u00e1zquez of New York, saw two men playing and realized his mistake.\u201cI looked it up on Google Maps and realized there is a new Grandstand,\u201d Wiley said Monday. \u201cI had to run over there. And then later I had to run back to see M\u00f3nica Puig play in the old Grandstand.\u201dFor one year only \u2014 and perhaps for only a few more days \u2014 there are two Grandstands at the U.S.T.A. Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. One is the flashy new 16-sided stadium, a hexadecagon that holds 8,125 spectators and will henceforth be known as the Grandstand. The other is the old Grandstand, a gritty shoe box that holds about 6,000 fans and latches on to one side of Armstrong.That court, the site of so many rollicking matches over the years, has long been a fan favorite.\u201cI used to love the old Grandstand,\u201d Wozniacki said. \u201cSo when I heard they were tearing it down, I was really upset because it was one of my favorite courts ever. The intimacy of the court, and people were so close \u2014 it was a great atmosphere.\u201dBut, she added after her match at the new Grandstand, \u201cI walked in there today, and I was like, \u2018This court is really awesome.\u2019\u201dWozniacki has the distinction of being the first player to win at the new Grandstand, inaugurating it in fine style by beating Townsend, 4-6, 6-3, 6-1. Then John Isner and Frances Tiafoe, two American men, played a mini-epic there, with Isner coming from behind to win, 3-6, 4-6, 7-6 (5), 6-2, 7-6 (3), in 3 hours 27 minutes under a blazing sun.Even as the temperature soared into the afternoon, players and fans alike seemed to appreciate the new stadium. Many of the fans gathered in the shade from the white canopy that rims half the building, and the nearly circular design reminded some of Court 1 at Roland Garros in Paris, which is known as the bullring for its shape.Even after her disappointing loss, Townsend voiced her appreciation.\u201cThe court is amazing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful. I didn\u2019t realize how big it was until people started to come in and started to get a little more packed and people started cheering. To see the improvements they\u2019ve made in the course of the year, it\u2019s amazing.\u201dDarryl Baynes, a 54-year-old firefighter and tennis instructor from Watertown, Mass., said he had been attending the U.S. Open for 20 years and had always liked the old Grandstand. But he found a spot of shade under the overhang of the new one and watched as Isner made his comeback against Tiafoe.\u201cIt\u2019s like a bigger version of Court 17,\u201d he said, referring to the show court that opened in 2011. \u201cI always liked the old Grandstand, where people used to hang over the edge from Armstrong and look down on the action there.\u201dLuray Rusnock, a human resources official at a public library in Linden, N.J., looked out on the new Grandstand from a walkway that surrounds much of the court and said she loved it. Her son, Adam Rusnock, a data executive in Manhattan, had brought her to the Open as a Mother\u2019s Day gift.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty easy to get around, and the food court is right there. If you\u2019re in the shade, it\u2019s wonderful. It\u2019s really wonderful.\u201dBut the old Grandstand still has a place in the hearts of many.It was supposed to have been used only as a practice court this year and then torn down during construction on a new, roofed Louis Armstrong Stadium, expected to be finished in time for the 2018 Open. But because of a problem with the playing surface on Court 10, the Open organizers decided on Saturday to use the old Grandstand for matches.Work has continued on Court 10, and players may begin practicing on it as soon as Tuesday. It could also still host some matches, a possibility that leaves the old Grandstand\u2019s status up in the air.On Monday, Vasek Pospisil of Canada beat Jozef Kovalik of Slovakia, 6-1, 6-3, 6-3, in front of a vocal contingent of Canadian supporters at the old Grandstand. Pospisil had never played a singles match there, but now he, too, has an unexpected memory from the stadium.\u201cThe fans are really close, and it feels like everyone is looking over you,\u201d he said. \u201cI like when the fans are close and there is a good atmosphere.\u201dAfter Pospisil\u2019s match, Puig, who won the Olympic women\u2019s singles gold medal for Puerto Rico this month, took a 4-1 lead in her first set against Saisai Zheng behind strong support from the crowd. But Puig, perhaps exhausted from the Rio Games and the celebrations that followed, faded quickly, and Zheng won, 6-4, 6-2.\u201cThe calendar doesn\u2019t give you much room,\u201d Puig said.Wiley, the community coordinator, was there to support Puig, saying his boss\u2019s district, which includes parts of Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens, had many residents of Puerto Rican descent. Wiley did not have the privilege of seeing Puig win, but he did have the distinction of seeing matches at two Grandstands on the same day \u2014 something that, after this year, may never be possible again.\u201cI don\u2019t know why they can\u2019t have two Grandstands,\u201d Wiley said. \u201cI like them both.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The last several days should have put that to rest.Mr. Steinberg goes into detail in his notes below about how he developed his WYOMING theme, but what I liked most about it is that he was able to place the four landmarks in their correct geographic positions. That\u2019s a nice bit of constructing serendipity.We\u2019ve got the name of the square state, WYOMING, in the middle of the grid and OLD FAITHFUL in the northwest, DEVIL\u2019S TOWER in the northeast, JACKSON HOLE toward the west and FORT LARAMIE in the south east.Sometimes Monday puzzle clues can be a bit too straightforward for my tastes. I like a bit of wordplay in my clues, but I understand that it\u2019s tricky to keep clues at a Monday-level easiness. Today we have some fun clues, and I think that as long as you understand what those question-marked clues are asking of you, you shouldn\u2019t have too much of a problem solving this puzzle.\u2022 19A: This clue is asking you to think of a punny answer to \u201cGood job for an animal-loving ex-G. I.?\u201d An ex-G. I. would be a VET and, as an animal lover, a VETerinarian would be an appropriate job.\u2022 40D: If you struggle with a clue that sounds vague on first reading, break it down. The clue says, \u201cCBS spinoff set in SoCal,\u201d so you can almost bet that L.A. will be in there somewhere. From there, work the crossings.I constructed this puzzle over my college\u2019s spring break. I\u2019ve recently been trying to come up with themes involving grid art, since I always find it really elegant when I\u2019m solving. The only problem with this approach is that Bruce Haight (also known as Mr. Grid Art) has already come up so many of the great grid-art designs! A dog? Nope, Bruce did that last February. A school of fish? Nope, he did that one in August 2014. Lightning bolts? Nope, those were part of his and Peter Collins\u2019s kite puzzle from March 2014. Anyway, I was so frustrated that I couldn\u2019t come up with a new grid art idea that I decided to make an \u201canti-grid art\u201d puzzle! What could be more anti-grid art than a good old square grid?Once I started thinking about square things, my mind jumped to Wyoming, which has always looked so boxy to me on the map! If I could somehow build a puzzle about Wyoming, having a standard 15 x 15 grid could be a cool bonus. Fast forward several hours. By some ginormous stroke of luck, I noticed that four of the most famous landmarks in Wyoming all have the same letter count! So I whipped up a fill and sat down to write the clues. Once the excitement wore off, though, I realized that my theme was kind of boring \u2014 who cares about four landmarks in Wyoming anyway? That\u2019s when inspiration struck again. Since all the landmarks were the same length, why not arrange them in their geographically correct positions? A quick look at Google Maps showed me that I was even luckier than I\u2019d thought: The four landmarks I\u2019d picked were all in different parts of the state! So I scrapped my original grid and built the version you see today.I hope you enjoy!Your thoughts?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Betting Billions on Rio, Comcast Hopes to Win the Future of Television", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "Supported byMediatorIt was the equivalent of the Yankees losing Derek Jeter just before the World Series. Mr. Ebersol had made the Olympics central to the NBC brand for two decades, and he was hands-down the American television executive best connected to Olympic officials in Switzerland.Mr. Roberts, a second-generation cable executive but a newbie in broadcast television, faced two seemingly bad options: He could break with Mr. Ebersol\u2019s legacy and go down in television history as the person who failed to keep the Olympics in the NBC stable or he could become known as the person who lost by keeping them.The rights were going to cost many billions of dollars, and NBC had lost more than $200 million on the 2010 Vancouver Games, an ominous harbinger. Mr. Roberts and his executive team \u2014 including Mr. Ebersol\u2019s successor, Mark Lazarus, and the NBCUniversal chief executive Steve Burke \u2014 had less than 30 days to figure it out. \u201cIt was a really stressful time,\u201d he told me in an interview on Wednesday.In short, Team Comcast bet the store, or, at least, a quarter of it. And they did it for what some analysts were calling \u201ca loss leader,\u201d something that was good for the brand, maybe, but bad for the bottom line. Or so it seemed.This year, the risk is starting to make sense, and it has to do with not only profits \u2014 which are considerable \u2014 but also the future of television and the way people watch it.First, there\u2019s the profit part.Comcast and NBC expect a record take from the Rio Games, which start Friday. They have already drawn more than $1.2 billion in ad sales, and receipts are continuing to come in.But in that environment, big-ticket live sports broadcasts have emerged as the last refuge for advertisers distraught by the slow death of the 30-second commercial, which is under siege from DVRs and online programming. The Olympics \u2014 like the Super Bowl or the World Cup \u2014 are best enjoyed live, when commercials still work the old fashioned way; they sneak up on you during breaks.\u201cTV is the best in terms of drawing people together and aggregating large audiences,\u201d Mr. Roberts said.It doesn\u2019t hurt that this year\u2019s Games are taking place one hour later than Eastern time, meaning Americans can easily watch them as they\u2019re happening, rather than on the dreaded tape delay (potentially after they already know the results).But more important to Comcast, and the entire media industry, is the future-of-television part of this equation.The trends that are causing television audiences to erode are not promising to abate any time soon. Alternative entertainment and media options continue to proliferate. But Comcast and NBC are using that as an opportunity during the Olympics; they are planning to fill every stream \u2014 on cable and the internet \u2014 as never before.To understand how significant a change this is, Mr. Roberts pointed to the last time the Summer Olympics were truly taking place live in prime time: the Atlanta Games in 1996.\u201cTwenty years ago, there was something like 170 hours of live content on one channel,\u201d Mr. Roberts said. \u201cNow we\u2019ll have 6,800 hours on 11 channels, and up to 41 live streams. So that\u2019s effectively 52 channels with 6,800 hours versus one channel with 170 hours.\u201dIt\u2019s also a ridiculous amount of content. Just think about it: How do you navigate that much sports? And do you even want to?In full promotional mode, Mr. Roberts told me, 21st Century Fox is media and Google is technology. \u201cWe are at the cross-section between media and technology.\u201dGot that, 21st Century Fox and Google (now called Alphabet)? Of course, their executive chairmen \u2014 Rupert Murdoch and Eric Schmidt \u2014 would most likely beg to differ (and they are welcome to call me anytime to discuss it).A lot can still go wrong: the Zika virus; serious concerns about water quality, and that small matter of the Russian doping scandal that resulted in the disqualification of more than 100 athletes.\u201cYou can only control what you can control,\u201d Mr. Roberts said. And should the worst fears come to pass, he said, \u201cWe will report on all the reality of Rio \u2014 we\u2019re not trying to in any way make light of any serious issues.\u201dAnd of course, profits are never guaranteed, as Vancouver proved. Mr. Roberts said he was still optimistic, and predicted these would be \u201ca very profitable Olympics,\u201d and possibly, \u201cthe largest aggregated audience in the history of television.\u201dThe Olympics\u2019 place at the heart of NBC\u2019s brand was a passion for Mr. Ebersol, a classic programmer from a bygone era. Comcast could have used the billions it spent on the Olympics on something else. Its decision to go all-in was predicated on a new bet \u2014 that for all their new options, Americans still want a big shared experience like the Olympics, and that big-ticket events are still part of the television future. All it takes is $12 billion and a dream.Advertisement"}

Those who \u201cproduce work that challenges deeply held beliefs and myths about the past\u201d are often accused of \u201cbeing elitist, nihilistic or simply out of touch with that imaginary place \u2018the real world.\u2019\u200a\u201d Let\u2019s make sure that everyone\u2019s voice counts in this debate. No single person or group \u201cowns\u201d history, and all views and contributions should be welcome.ANDREW SCOTT COOPERBROOKLYN\u2b25To the Editor:I appreciated Azadeh Moaveni\u2019s incisive review of Andrew Scott Cooper\u2019s attempted whitewash of the shah of Iran. Nevertheless, Moaveni is too credulous of Cooper\u2019s allegations that President Jimmy Carter opposed and exaggerated the shah\u2019s human rights abuses.While Carter claimed that human rights would underscore his foreign policy, he effusively praised the shah. During a visit by the Iranian leader to the White House, Carter referred to the Iranian dictator\u2019s \u201cenlightened leadership\u201d and \u201creaffirmed to His Majesty that he fully supports the special relationship\u201d between the two nations \u2014 a relationship characterized in large part by the sale of weapons in one direction and oil in the other.Carter topped even these fulsome tributes a month later in Tehran, declaring, in a mind-numbing misreading of historical momentum: \u201cIran, because of the great leadership of the shah, is an island of stability in one of the more troubled areas of the world.\u201d As Iranian opposition to the shah mounted, the president saw only \u201cthe admiration and love which your people give to you,\u201d adding: \u201cThere is no leader with whom I have a deeper sense of personal gratitude and personal friendship.\u201dTo be sure, some Carter administration officials did take the president\u2019s human rights rhetoric seriously, criticizing the shah for widespread imprisonment and torture of opponents. But Carter for most of his presidency publicly backed this tyrant, ensuring that those who deposed him would direct their ire against the United States as well \u2014 helping to inaugurate 40 years of U.S.-\u00adIranian antagonism, which Presidents Obama and Rouhani have only recently begun to overcome.ROBERT SHAFFERSHIPPENSBURG, PA.The writer is a professor of history at Shippensburg University. \u2b25Is This the Place?To the Editor:If one types \u201cThis Must Be the Place\u201d in Google, information about the movie and the song are the first hits. In fact, the one chapter I read of O\u2019Farrell\u2019s book reminded me so strongly of the movie\u2019s plot \u2014 a man with a troubled life in Ireland finds himself emotionally conflicted about traveling back to the States for a family function concerning his father \u2014 that I couldn\u2019t believe O\u2019Farrell stumbled upon her theme and title independent of the movie and song.PAUL WEINGARTNERCHICO, CALIF.\u2b25What Happens in Nevada To the Editor:BARBARA J.

{"Headline": "Gridlock Comes to Kuala Lumpur", "Date": "2016-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTraffic dominates the daily lives of those who live and work in Kuala Lumpur and the network of smaller but still populous cities that surround it, collectively known as the Klang Valley. Conversations between friends often begin with comparisons of recent experiences of traffic jams. (My current gripe: an hour to drive six and a half miles from Damansara Heights to Taman Megah, which Google tells me should take 15 minutes.) People become accustomed to their dinner guests\u2019 arriving an hour late; parents wake their children earlier than ever to ensure they get to school on time.As Malaysia navigates its way from developing country to middle-class-nation status, the battle of its capital city against worsening traffic will play a crucial role in shaping the country\u2019s 21st-century identity. Next to its regional neighbors, will it be a choking urban sprawl (think Jakarta) or a hyper-efficient, sustainable metropolis (think Singapore)?Getting these newly middle-class drivers out of their status symbols and onto public transportation is a monumental task, further complicated by the sprawling nature of the suburbs and the network of smaller conurbations that make up greater Kuala Lumpur. In any case, a severe lack of options in mass transit \u2014 with especially poor rail connections outside the metropolitan area \u2014 makes traveling by private car the only choice for many journeys. Only 20 percent of trips in the capital are made by public transportation.The Klang Valley\u2019s principal bus operator, Rapid KL, complains of a chronic shortage of bus drivers to cover its 160 routes, resulting in erratic schedules and low ridership \u2014 the daily passenger total numbers only about 280,000 out of the Klang Valley\u2019s total population of seven million. The city\u2019s two main train lines \u2014 the Light Rail Transit and Monorail \u2014 are efficient and affordable but operate just two routes each.At present, only one 3.5-mile stretch of bicycle lane exists, and Malaysia\u2019s year-round stifling heat makes even the shortest cycle commute uncomfortable. For many residents, the cheap and plentiful taxis are the main alternative; the recent arrival of Uber has provided a further option. But these cars add to, rather than relieve, congestion on the roads.The success of the new rail system is crucial to the ambitions of a city hoping to strengthen its image as one of the world\u2019s friendliest places to do business. It\u2019s also essential to the continued stability of one of Asia\u2019s most racially diverse cities. With sizable ethnic Chinese and Indian communities living alongside the Malay-Muslim majority, the linking of areas traditionally populated by one group or another is key to enabling the city to function as a rich cultural melting pot.As for the ostrich, a young female named Chickaboo, all ended happily. After a brief chase, she was recaptured and safely returned to the farm where she was born. Her escapade was a hit in Kuala Lumpur, personifying what many of us feel: better to take your chances on foot than get caught in rush hour.Advertisement"}

She wanted character, not shiny out of the box. Some of the cymbals she got were grimy with age and water spots that hinted of concerts in the rain. Others were chipped, dinged and dented.\u201cYou walk through space and you have cause and effect,\u201d she said.But like Mr. Allen himself, who has fingerprints on much of the city\u2019s explosion of growth, geekiness only touches the surface.Now his passion for art, as a collector and benefactor, is resonating too. The fair, which featured 84 galleries from locations as varied as New York, Los Angeles, Seoul and Miami \u2014 up from 60 in its first year \u2014 drew more than 15,000 visitors last year, and had about 18,000 by the fair\u2019s close on Sunday.What the fair says about Seattle, and whether its art community was sufficiently represented, with 18 Pacific Northwest galleries on the roster \u2014 and only 10 from Seattle \u2014 remains a continuing debate.\u201cIf there\u2019s going to be all this energy, and all these collectors coming in from out of town, and critics and press talking about it, we can either, as an art community, sit on the sideline and watch the spectacle, or we can participate and ride that wave. I\u2019m not one to sit out a big opportunity,\u201d said Greg Lundgren, Out of Sight\u2019s founder.\u201cPeople are really trying to rise to the occasion,\u201d said Kirsten Anderson, Roq La Rue\u2019s owner and founder. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard as much complaining this year,\u201d she added.Carl and Jeannette Pergam, both retired physicians who were visiting the fair from a Seattle suburb, said they were struck by the high prices, which they said spoke to them partly about the art\u2019s quality, but also about the wave of wealth in Seattle from the explosion of growth at technology companies like Amazon and Microsoft.\u201cThe ones I would put up on my wall are sparse,\u201d said Ms. Vartanian, 47, a cancer researcher who lives in Seattle. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of important work here.\u201dMr. Allen said in an interview that he pushed no particular vision of what the fair should be about, but that he likes the interplay of intellect and emotion.\u201cThere\u2019s always this interesting tension between fairly intellectual pursuits like science, and more visceral pursuits like art, and how they respond and bond to each other,\u201d he said. He also deeply appreciates, he added, the simple joy of the unexpected.Laura Fried, the Seattle Art Fair\u2019s artistic director, said that she gravitated to what the artists were trying to say about the connection between technology and modern life.\u201cThe conceptual underpinnings are more what I find interesting,\u201d she said.\u201cThe way that we are arranging our world is changing, with digital space merging with physical space,\u201d she said. \u201cI really love thinking about softness in public.\u201dMs. Kasper said she thought about the human stories behind the objects in assembling her cymbals project.

{"Headline": "Is That Real Tuna in Your Sushi? Now, a Way to Track That Fish", "Date": "2016-08-13", "News": "Supported byPrototypeBeyond Maine lobster, Maryland crabs and Gulf shrimp, fish has been largely ignored by foodies obsessing over the provenance of their meals, even though seafood travels a complex path. Until recently, diners weren\u2019t asking many questions about where it came from, which meant restaurants and retailers didn\u2019t feel a need to provide the information.From a young age, Mr. Auerbach had romantic notions about fishing, specifically the idea of catching fish to feed his family and neighbors.\u201cIt\u2019s cool in this day and age that people wake up in the morning and go make a living interacting with nature and feeding their community,\u201d he said. He went into commercial fishing straight out of college, taking a job on an Alaskan salmon boat and later returning to New England to work on lobster boats and learn more about the fishing industry there.Soon after Mr. Auerbach founded Red\u2019s Best in 2008, he realized that a combination of government regulations and commercial fishing\u2019s embrace of technology were effectively threatening the existence of small fishing boats. Yet smaller boats travel short distances and catch fewer fish, which Mr. Auerbach said improves their quality.\u201cWe try to push people to eat local, traceable fish,\u201d he said.Like most other seafood distributors, he was relying on an antiquated, four-part carbon copy system that was so cumbersome, he was routinely shuffling paperwork until 2 a.m.\u201cThe boat would get a copy at the point of unloading,\u201d Mr. Auerbach said. \u201cThe government would get a copy. I\u2019d file a copy. And then I\u2019d write in the prices.\u201d As for paying the fishermen: \u201cI\u2019d have to get checks and then match the checks to the paperwork and mail them. It was an absolute nightmare that wasn\u2019t scalable.\u201dNow the Red\u2019s Best software does that work. For instance, a company driver backs a truck down to the long wooden pier in Woods Hole, Mass., each afternoon, so that fishermen can load their bluefish, striped bass, bonito, conch, horseshoe crabs and other seafood. But instead of a thick pad of paper and carbon sheets, the driver wields a waterproof wireless computer tablet with a Bluetooth mobile printer.\u201cHe\u2019s putting their catch data directly onto the internet, and our whole staff all over the country can see in real time as fish is being unloaded onto our truck,\u201d Mr. Auerbach said. When the fish arrives at Red\u2019s Best\u2019s Boston plant, it is instantly received into inventory and reported to the federal government.The company affixes a traceability label on each box of fish. The label has a two-dimensional bar code that can be scanned by smartphones to reveal who caught the fish, where and how. A unique web page is automatically created for that fish. Buyers, typically high-end wholesalers throughout the country, and their customers can scan the code to learn the story behind the fish.Mr. Auerbach, who has 100 employees, projects the company will sell 20 million pounds of seafood this year, caught almost exclusively by 1,000 small vessels.Eventually, Red\u2019s Best hopes to sell directly to consumers. \u201cLike, a bluefin tuna is being unloaded right this second in Provincetown, Mass., and you buy a pound of it to be delivered to your home tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cI want that tuna sold as deep into the supply chain as possible.\u201dBy that he means ideally the fish will travel from the company\u2019s Boston hub directly to home cooks\u2019 refrigerators. Currently, people can buy Red\u2019s Best fish at its store at the Boston Public Market, at several farmers\u2019 markets, or shipped through AmazonFresh and, starting last week, FedEx.\u201cI got the data,\u201d he said. \u201cI got the fish. I know people want it.\u201dSea to Table hopes to sell fish directly to home chefs starting this year, too.But local seafood can cost more than many Americans are accustomed to paying, which partly accounts for the rampant seafood fraud in this country.\u201cU.S. fisheries are very well managed and are actually growing nicely,\u201d said Michael Dimin, the founder of Sea to Table. \u201cBut the U.S. consumer\u2019s been trained to buy cheap food, and imported seafood is really cheap because of I.U.U. fishing.\u201d I.U.U. stands for illegal, unreported and unregulated. The result is unsustainably fished, cheap seafood flooding American fish markets and grocery chains.\u201cTo us, the secret is traceability,\u201d Mr. Dimin said. \u201cIf you can shine a light on where it came from, you can make informed decisions.\u201dMr. Auerbach concedes that some local fish is expensive, but he maintains that many lesser-known varieties are affordable. \u201cMaybe halibut and scallops are for the wealthy,\u201d he says. \u201cBut dogfish, skate, porgy and mackerel are all very inexpensive, healthy and great tasting.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Users will be able to click images, or pins, of featured products next to the videos. That could, for instance, bring them to a brand\u2019s website or allow them to buy the product without leaving Pinterest.The move puts the social-bookmarking site in competition with the likes of Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat, as well as large digital publishers, which are all vying for the increasingly large amounts of marketers\u2019 digital ad dollars.Last year, Etsy was the website with the greatest number of links from Pinterest\u2019s Save button.

He oversaw all civil antitrust enforcement and competition policy in the areas of computer hardware and software, high technology component manufacturing, financial services, securities industries and professional associations.In the no-poaching case, the government accused Adobe Systems, Apple, Google, Intel, Intuit and Pixar Animation of entering into agreements that blocked the recruiting of each other\u2019s employees. The government argued that such a pact undercut competition among companies vying for employees with advanced or highly specialized skills, and squelched competition among workers \u2014 effectively putting a lid on wages and depriving them of access to better job opportunities.The agreements, overseen by senior executives, had barred companies from \u201ccold calling\u201d a competitor\u2019s workers to make better compensation offers, according to a 2010 settlement.The companies did not admit legal wrongdoing when they signed the settlement, which disallowed practices like the ban on cold calling and which was effective for five years.Mr. Tierney, who has been the networks and technology section head since 2006, will join Orrick\u2019s office in Washington as a partner with an antitrust practice, starting on Aug. 22.

{"Headline": "Cloud Computing Brings Sprawling Centers, but Few Jobs, to Small Towns", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBoydton JournalBOYDTON, Va. \u2014 A giant Microsoft facility just outside this very small town hides behind a quarter-mile berm and a guard house, across the highway from the rubble of a demolished prison.Behind the berm, six unmarked hangars each hold tens of thousands of computer servers. Microsoft has cleared enough scrub trees and vines for at least 15 of these buildings, and six more are already under construction.One thing there isn\u2019t much of at this Microsoft complex, one single computer data center, is long-term work. Microsoft says it might have \u201cseveral dozen\u201d employees in a place like this. They are mostly elite computer workers who tend not to come from Boydton, which lost a lot of good jobs when nearby factories closed and the prison shut down.So it is in a number of small towns across the country, as technology giants like Amazon, Google and Microsoft race to build networks of unprecedented size to provide services over the internet, a technology trend known as cloud computing. Local people, along with many economists and officials, often think these data centers are a key to an industrial revival. But the reality is less impressive.\u201cI\u2019ve worked on a lot of nuclear power plants, and these things are a lot bigger than that,\u201d said E. W. Gregory, the head of the local electrical workers\u2019 union. But \u201cthe first thing they put in was a guard shack and a fence. I\u2019ve filled rooms with people looking for entry-level work. None of it lasts.\u201dThe companies come to places like Boydton for basics like land, water and electricity. Even with low local wages, people are a high-cost item. As small as the staffs at these mammoth facilities are, companies say, perhaps a third of the company jobs will eventually be filled by robots.Google started building in eastern Oregon to be near cheap hydroelectric power on the Columbia River, and most recently it has focused on Iowa, Alabama and Tennessee. Microsoft has a center in Wyoming, and it bought a nine-hole golf course as part of a complex near West Des Moines, Iowa. Amazon recently built similar giant facilities on the outer reaches of Columbus, Ohio, and Dulles, Va.\u201cA lot of this stuff is put in rural parts of the country that used to be part of a manufacturing economy\u201d that has gone overseas, said Bill Coughran, a partner at the venture investment firm Sequoia Capital who ran much of Google\u2019s big engineering for eight years. \u201cTextiles and furniture created a big power grid in the south. Then those jobs went away.\u201dThat\u2019s been the story for Boydton, population 430, in the middle of tobacco country a few miles from the North Carolina border. The prison across from the Microsoft center closed in 2012. A nearby Burlington Industries textile plant that employed more than 2,000 shut in 2002. It was razed in 2012.The South Virginia tobacco economy collapsed as Americans cut back on smoking. But in 1999, Virginia used some of the $4.1 billion it received in a settlement with cigarette makers to build high-speed fiber-optic lines throughout the region.The broadband drew Microsoft, along with some financial perks. Mecklenburg County, which received $2.1 million from the state for the project, has given Microsoft 350 acres and offset personal property taxes by 82.5 percent, according to Wayne Carter, the county administrator.Initially, Apple, which is building a big cloud center for consumers\u2019 photos and music, wanted the Boydton site, but it went across the border to North Carolina, which promised tax breaks on its data center equipment. Not to be outdone, Virginia passed laws in 2009 and 2010 that exempted sales taxes on things like data center computer servers, software, power generators and chillers to cool all that equipment.\u201cWe\u2019ve had six years of construction work,\u201d said Mr. Carter. That has helped the county, he said, because even temporary workers rent houses, stay in hotels and eat in local restaurants.Microsoft did not dispute reports that it would spend $1.1 billion on the Boydton data center, and said that \u201con average, data centers employ tens to several dozen people,\u201d in a mixture of corporate and contracted positions. It declined to let a reporter tour the site.\u201cThey talked about 100 jobs, but it\u2019s a slow process,\u201d said Thomas C. Coleman III, the mayor of Boydton. So far, he says, the biggest impact \u201chas been a couple of lunch tables at the Triangle gas station.\u201dHe understates matters, but not by much. Mr. Gregory, the electrician, said his union had hundreds of applicants for work digging ditches and laying pipe, starting at $10.88 an hour. Wiring paid $28.59. Both jobs tended to last about six months, he said, with lots of attrition for the hard outdoor labor.Working as a security guard or as someone testing the wires inside the data center offers better money, but there are not many positions. Microsoft prefers to fly in its own specialists for some work, and it doesn\u2019t like hiring people who have worked in other big companies\u2019 cloud-computing centers, Mr. Gregory said. (Microsoft said it did not exclude candidates based on previous experience.)\u201cWe can provide a place to live, but all those contractors will move on to the next town where they\u2019re building,\u201d Mr. Coleman said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you can count on.\u201dThe big cloud networks are immensely profitable for the few companies who can operate these global systems. The biggest three cloud companies estimate that the global market in business computing is worth $1 trillion or more, and they are rushing to expand globally. In interviews, all said they spend more than $2 billion annually on this.\u201cIt\u2019s phenomenal how rapidly they are growing,\u201d said Erik Brynjolfsson, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has written extensively on the impact of new technologies. \u201cIt is the key enabler of all kinds of technology advances, starting with the things companies do now, but lots cheaper, including outsourcing tech jobs.\u201dThat is hard to imagine in places where local roots go so deep. Conversations here usually start with people explaining where they are from, and what their families did here for generations. \u201cBoydton is the quintessential quaint courthouse town,\u201d said Leigh Lambert, the town librarian. \u201cPeople from here love it. It feels like it\u2019s always with you.\u201dMs. Lambert grew up nearby, tried New York, and returned to work next to the court, which is adorned with a statue of a Confederate soldier. Microsoft initially came to a couple of town meetings, and it seemed to offer a way Boydton could come back. \u201cNow they\u2019re off by themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cWe hear they have a really nice Starbucks machine.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Intel\u2019s New Mission: Find Fresh Uses for Its Famous Paranoia", "Date": "2016-08-14", "News": "Supported byBitsThat sounds cool, if you like your capitalism fierce. That idea, however, turns out to have some significant downsides.Intel is the world\u2019s biggest semiconductor company because when Mr. Grove was in charge, it dominated the personal computer industry and was an important player in the associated business in computer servers.Today, the PC market is shrinking, hurting Intel\u2019s profits. The server-chip industry is still strong, thanks to the rise of cloud computing at companies like Facebook and Google. Cloud companies engineer server chips in ways that make very powerful and flexible systems used by millions of people.But Intel missed joining a number of other markets that did not look like the PC business, particularly smartphones. It is scrambling for a place in sensors (or what is called the internet of things), wireless networking, autonomous vehicles and other hot areas, as computing spreads from traditional computers to nearly every machine.\u201cThe mistake was, when you grow with great leadership and great success, your paranoia is focused on the one thing that is delivering that,\u201d Brian Krzanich, Intel\u2019s current chief executive, said in an interview.From PC-dominated computing, he said, we are now \u201cwhere computing is constantly shifting.\u201d Mr. Krzanich says he is still a strong believer in paranoia, but he must turn that vigilant anxiety in a lot of directions at once. Cloud computing may be Intel\u2019s core, but Mr. Krzanich has to feed it from chips in many markets.The effect of those changes will be seen this week as Intel holds its Developer Forum in San Francisco. The conference is where the hard-core geeks of computing gather to hear about what\u2019s coming in the realms of processing power, memory and other technology that enables the modern world.Giant tech trade shows like the International CES, held in Las Vegas every January, are focused on hot products. Developer events may be nerd-fests, but they say more about the technology world, and where a company hopes to be in two or three years.Shifting gears for the giant chip company is no easy task. \u201cIntel has four main business lines \u2014 PCs, mobile, internet of things and servers \u2014 and it\u2019s hitting on one of them,\u201d said Patrick Gelsinger, a longtime Intel executive who is now chief executive of the software company VMware. The factories where Intel builds chips \u201cnow cost $10 billion, at least,\u201d each to set up, he said, \u201cand the competition is catching up.\u201dIn April, Intel announced it was cutting its work force by 12,000 people, about 11 percent of workers. About a quarter of the executives who report to Mr. Krzanich come from other companies, a big deal at a place where leaders rise through the ranks over decades.In his speech, Mr. Krzanich may stay away from talking about wearable devices. Last month, Intel withdrew a health-monitoring watch that had some nice capabilities but sometimes burned its wearers\u2019 skin. Even so, Mr. Krzanich said, the heart-monitoring capabilities of that watch will find their way into a device Intel plans to make with the athletics brand New Balance.The part he is looking forward to, Mr. Krzanich said, is a one-hour question-and-answer session with 200 elite developers. \u201cIt\u2019s a much broader group\u201d than even a couple of years ago, he said. \u201cPeople writing for machine learning and A.I., networking chips, how virtual reality feeds into PCs.\u201d Even in decline, PC chips still make up half of Intel\u2019s revenue.If these things catch on, Intel will sell more chips to those businesses and create new demand for cloud computing, because most devices are now connected to the cloud.Even so, another pillar of the Intel mythology, the unchanging nature of Moore\u2019s Law, is getting revised. Named for the Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, it states that a chip\u2019s power doubles every 18 to 24 months without a rise in costs. Mr. Grove\u2019s paranoia championed and fed on Moore\u2019s Law, as Intel strove to achieve profit from that computing cadence.Silicon Valley treats Moore\u2019s Law as if it is immutable, and with even more reverence than it does paranoia. But it was not a scientific law; it was always an observation about the behavior of a market for computers and software, which paid off at a rate to justify increasing investment in making chips.That is why Intel is in the wireless and networking fields, and is working on a new kind of three-dimensional memory chip, which Mr. Krzanich said would be out at the end of this year, that can speed performance of big-data-type calculations sevenfold.There would be a historical precedent to that shift. Years ago, Intel\u2019s main business was in memory chips, a market that collapsed three decades ago, leading the company to move toward making number-crunching processors for PCs. That shift, which arguably saved the company, was the lesson that led to Mr. Grove\u2019s paranoia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Memorial in Alabama Will Honor Victims of Lynching", "Date": "2016-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne day in October 1910, a mob of white people in Montgomery, Ala., tried to seize and lynch several black men who were being held in a downtown jail on suspicion of interracial sexual relations.Unsuccessful, the angry mob found a black man named John Dell sitting nearby in the taxi cab he drove. They shot him dead. No one was prosecuted, and Mr. Dell, as with roughly a dozen other lynching victims in the city\u2019s history, was essentially unacknowledged.Next year, not far from the site of Mr. Dell\u2019s death, one of the first \u2014 and certainly the largest \u2014 memorials to the victims of the thousands of racial lynchings in United States history is scheduled to open.The group will also unveil plans for a museum to open in April, in its roughly 11,000-square-foot headquarters, that will trace the country\u2019s racial history from slavery to the era of mass incarceration.The memorial will sit on six acres, the highest spot in the first capital of the Confederacy, on the site of what used to be a public housing complex.\u201cOur goal isn\u2019t to be divisive,\u201d said Bryan Stevenson, the director of the Equal Justice Initiative. \u201cOur goal is just to get people to confront the truth of our past with some more courage.\u201dThe museum and memorial project, for which Mr. Stevenson said he had raised about 40 percent of a projected $20 million, is the latest and most ambitious undertaking in a continuing effort by Mr. Stevenson to change public awareness of the nation\u2019s racial history.Contributors to the project include the Ford Foundation and Google.Designed in partnership with MASS, a Boston-based design group, the memorial will be made up of two parts.One is a large, four-sided gallery of 801 suspended six-foot columns, representing a county where a lynching took place and etched with the name of the person or people lynched \u2014 a term not limited to hangings.Duplicates of those columns will be placed in an adjacent field.People will be encouraged to retrieve the columns in the field and place them as markers in their home counties.The locations of lynchings from 1877 to 1950.The aim, he said, mentioning the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, is to be forthright about the horrors that were part of the nation\u2019s racial history and their continuity from slavery through Jim Crow to the present day.After that report, Mr. Stevenson launched a project to collect soil from unmarked lynching sites around the country. The soil will be placed in glass jars that will be on display at the museum.\u201cI\u2019m sure that there will be some people that will say, \u2018Why?\u2019\u201d he said in a phone interview.\u201cBut from our standpoint, the \u2018why\u2019 is to tell the story, and to tell it in a fashion that people want to come and see it. And spend money when they come to town.\u201dThe museum, called \u201cFrom Enslavement to Mass Incarceration,\u201d will be in the headquarters of the Equal Justice Initiative, a site in downtown Montgomery that was once a slave warehouse.Mr. Stevenson said the museum would have databases for historical research and virtual reality stations so people could begin to understand what it was like to be in the cargo hold of a slave trafficking ship, to endure angry taunts during a lunch counter sit-in and to sit, in the present day, in an overcrowded prison.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Ailes and Cosby, a Moment for More Women to Speak Up", "Date": "2016-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the fall of 1991, an obscure law professor named Anita Hill pushed the issue of sexual harassment into the public consciousness when she accused her former boss, the Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, of having repeatedly made lewd overtures toward her.But the episode sent a mixed message, in the view of many discrimination experts. While it raised awareness about a corrosive workplace behavior, the intense backlash against Ms. Hill, not least from members of the United States Senate, suggested that women faced great obstacles in redressing such abuses. (Mr. Thomas denied the allegations.)Nearly 25 years later, after a string of sexual harassment allegations that led to the ouster of Roger Ailes, the former chairman of Fox News, and a cascade of sexual assault accusations against the comedian Bill Cosby, some of those experts believe we may be approaching another Anita Hill moment.The Ailes and Cosby cases, they say, could be influential among women across the work force not just because of the intrinsic power of these examples, but because they come at a moment of empowerment for women in their struggle for equality. And when women\u2019s assertiveness produces dramatic results like the resignation of Mr. Ailes, it can inspire more women to follow the same path.\u201cWhen Anita Hill came out against Clarence Thomas, she got nothing and Clarence Thomas got life tenure,\u201d said Linda Hirshman, a Supreme Court biographer and former women\u2019s studies professor. \u201cIf anything would make the idea of women coming forward into a real threat, it would be the wicked confluence of everybody\u2019s dad, Bill Cosby, and Roger Ailes, the scariest man in the world \u2014 the fact that those two are going down.\u201dStill, workplace advocates caution that a greater sense of power, and even high-profile legal victories, will not necessarily lead to a significant increase in the number of women who take formal action. They note studies indicating that the great majority of sexual harassment incidents at work still go unreported.That sentiment was echoed by Carol Costello, a CNN anchor who, in a segment that aired last week, said that she had been sexually harassed when she was younger. Ms. Costello said she was inspired by the Ailes and Cosby cases to step forward, and thought it was important \u201cto add my voice to the cause,\u201d but was skeptical about whether it would lead to systemic change.\u201cI still think that there are consequences for women who come forward vocally or file lawsuits,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cA part of me still thinks that things haven\u2019t changed all that much.\u201dThe number of women filing sexual harassment charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission did increase significantly in the years after Ms. Hill came forward. But the impact of her testimony on that increase was somewhat muddied by a 1991 law that gave people alleging employment discrimination the right to a jury trial and allowed for additional monetary awards.Widely publicized cases appear to have played a role in prompting others to come forward in a variety of narrower contexts as well.A similar pattern appears to have played out in the banking industry. After the equal employment commission joined a prominent discrimination case against Morgan Stanley in 2001, the agency saw an uptick in sex discrimination charges from inside financial firms.The advertising industry has had its own increase in women speaking out. In March, the chief executive of the storied agency J. Walter Thompson resigned after a female employee filed a lawsuit accusing him of racist and sexist behavior. Within weeks, a number of top female executives had come forward to publicly describe their own experiences with sexism in the industry.The matter involving Gretchen Carlson, the former Fox anchor who filed a sexual harassment and retaliation lawsuit against Mr. Ailes last month, appears to be having a similar effect, beginning with at least two women who breached settlement agreements to describe their own experiences at the network.Kamee Verdrager, a lawyer, is pursuing her own yearslong legal battle over allegations of discrimination against a former employer, the law firm Mintz Levin, which stripped her of two years\u2019 seniority after she returned from maternity leave, and subsequently fired her. (Mintz Levin denies the allegations of discrimination but doesn\u2019t dispute these facts.) She said that prior examples of women speaking out could provide an enormous psychological boost for others contemplating their own action.In Ms. Verdrager\u2019s case, reading a book about women\u2019s struggles to succeed in the legal profession, which included numerous interviews with women who had faced discrimination, helped persuade her to file her complaint. \u201cThat book changed my life,\u201d she said. \u201cThe takeaway was that this is not unique to me. It\u2019s epidemic.\u201dBut the same connectedness that can provide support for victims can also work against them; some plaintiff\u2019s lawyers argue that the risks of speaking out have actually increased over time. Three decades ago, a court filing would have been extremely difficult for a prospective employer to uncover. Today, said Linda D. Friedman, a prominent employment lawyer who has brought many cases against Wall Street firms, the \u201ctroublemaker\u201d charge is likely to dog plaintiffs their entire lives.\u201cAny H.R. person in the country can do a Google search and come up with a federal complaint before deciding whether to hire a person,\u201d she said.To the extent that a high-profile case like Ms. Carlson\u2019s may encourage more survivors of harassment to come forward, many advocates say, it is more likely to happen indirectly, by first persuading employers to take discrimination and harassment claims more seriously. Only after most employees believe they can speak up without risking their careers, a development that many plaintiff\u2019s lawyers doubt is imminent, will they do so in substantially larger numbers.Still, if the fallout from the accusations against Mr. Cosby and Mr. Ailes is any indication, an increasing number of women may be concluding that speaking up is more likely than before to result in punishment for the alleged perpetrator rather than the accuser.Ms. Hill, now a professor at Brandeis University, is cautiously optimistic, though she worries that the $40 million payment Mr. Ailes reportedly received to leave Fox News could detract from the lesson of the case.\u201cThe fact the company is now not only talking to the women\u201d who have said they experienced harassment, \u201cbut also talking about whether others were enablers, that\u2019s important,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen who experienced harassment in their own workplace may see this as a possible outcome.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside Facebook\u2019s (Totally Insane, Unintentionally Gigantic, Hyperpartisan) Political-Media Machine", "Date": "2016-08-24", "News": "FeatureHow a strange new class of media outlet has arisen to take over our news feeds.Supported byAnd then: A family member who loves politics asking, \u201cIs this really who we want to be president?\u201d A co-worker, whom you\u2019ve never heard talk about politics, asking the same about a different candidate. A story about Donald Trump that \u201cjust can\u2019t be true\u201d in a figurative sense. A story about Donald Trump that \u201cjust can\u2019t be true\u201d in a literal sense. A video of Bernie Sanders speaking, overlaid with text, shared from a source you\u2019ve never seen before, viewed 15 million times. An article questioning Hillary Clinton\u2019s honesty; a headline questioning Donald Trump\u2019s sanity. A few shares that go a bit too far: headlines you would never pass along yourself but that you might tap, read and probably not forget.Maybe you\u2019ve noticed your feed becoming bluer; maybe you\u2019ve felt it becoming redder. Either way, in the last year, it has almost certainly become more intense. You\u2019ve seen a lot of media sources you don\u2019t recognize and a lot of posts bearing no memorable brand at all. You\u2019ve seen politicians and celebrities and corporations weigh in directly; you\u2019ve probably seen posts from the candidates themselves. You\u2019ve seen people you\u2019re close to and people you\u2019re not, with increasing levels of urgency, declare it is now time to speak up, to take a stand, to set aside allegiances or hangups or political correctness or hate.The Facebook product, to users in 2016, is familiar yet subtly expansive. Its algorithms have their pick of text, photos and video produced and posted by established media organizations large and small, local and national, openly partisan or nominally unbiased. But there\u2019s also a new and distinctive sort of operation that has become hard to miss: political news and advocacy pages made specifically for Facebook, uniquely positioned and cleverly engineered to reach audiences exclusively in the context of the news feed. These are news sources that essentially do not exist outside of Facebook, and you\u2019ve probably never heard of them. They have names like Occupy Democrats; The Angry Patriot; US Chronicle; Addicting Info; RightAlerts; Being Liberal; Opposing Views; Fed-Up Americans; American News; and hundreds more. Some of these pages have millions of followers; many have hundreds of thousands.Using a tool called CrowdTangle, which tracks engagement for Facebook pages across the network, you can see which pages are most shared, liked and commented on, and which pages dominate the conversation around election topics. Using this data, I was able to speak to a wide array of the activists and entrepreneurs, advocates and opportunists, reporters and hobbyists who together make up 2016\u2019s most disruptive, and least understood, force in media.Individually, these pages have meaningful audiences, but cumulatively, their audience is gigantic: tens of millions of people. On Facebook, they rival the reach of their better-funded counterparts in the political media, whether corporate giants like CNN or The New York Times, or openly ideological web operations like Breitbart or Mic. And unlike traditional media organizations, which have spent years trying to figure out how to lure readers out of the Facebook ecosystem and onto their sites, these new publishers are happy to live inside the world that Facebook has created. Their pages are accommodated but not actively courted by the company and are not a major part of its public messaging about media. But they are, perhaps, the purest expression of Facebook\u2019s design and of the incentives coded into its algorithm \u2014 a system that has already reshaped the web and has now inherited, for better or for worse, a great deal of America\u2019s political discourse.Occupy got him on Facebook, but it was the 2012 election that showed him its potential. As he saw it, that election was defined by social media. He mentioned a set of political memes that now feel generationally distant: Clint Eastwood\u2019s empty chair at the 2012 Republican National Convention and Mitt Romney\u2019s debate gaffe about \u201cbinders full of women.\u201d He thought it was a bit silly, but he saw in these viral moments a language in which activists like him could spread their message.This year, political content has become more popular all across the platform: on homegrown Facebook pages, through media companies with a growing Facebook presence and through the sharing habits of users in general. But truly Facebook-native political pages have begun to create and refine a new approach to political news: cherry-picking and reconstituting the most effective tactics and tropes from activism, advocacy and journalism into a potent new mixture. This strange new class of media organization slots seamlessly into the news feed and is especially notable in what it asks, or doesn\u2019t ask, of its readers. The point is not to get them to click on more stories or to engage further with a brand. The point is to get them to share the post that\u2019s right in front of them. Everything else is secondary.While web publishers have struggled to figure out how to take advantage of Facebook\u2019s audience, these pages have thrived. Unburdened of any allegiance to old forms of news media and the practice, or performance, of any sort of ideological balance, native Facebook page publishers have a freedom that more traditional publishers don\u2019t: to engage with Facebook purely on its terms. These are professional Facebook users straining to build media companies, in other words, not the other way around.From a user\u2019s point of view, every share, like or comment is both an act of speech and an accretive piece of a public identity. Maybe some people want to be identified among their networks as news junkies, news curators or as some sort of objective and well-informed reader. Many more people simply want to share specific beliefs, to tell people what they think or, just as important, what they don\u2019t. A newspaper-style story or a dry, matter-of-fact headline is adequate for this purpose. But even better is a headline, or meme, that skips straight to an ideological conclusion or rebuts an argument.Rafael Rivero is an acquaintance of Provost\u2019s who, with his twin brother, Omar, runs a page called Occupy Democrats, which passed three million followers in June. This accelerating growth is attributed by Rivero, and by nearly every left-leaning page operator I spoke with, not just to interest in the election but especially to one campaign in particular: \u201cBernie Sanders is the Facebook candidate,\u201d Rivero says. The rise of Occupy Democrats essentially mirrored the rise of Sanders\u2019s primary run. On his page, Rivero started quoting text from Sanders\u2019s frequent email blasts, turning them into Facebook-ready memes with a consistent aesthetic: colors that pop, yellow on black. Rivero says that it\u2019s clear what his audience wants. \u201cI\u2019ve probably made 10,000 graphics, and it\u2019s like running 10,000 focus groups,\u201d he said. (Clinton was and is, of course, widely discussed by Facebook users: According to the company, in the last month 40.8 million people \u201cgenerated interactions\u201d around the candidate. But Rivero says that in the especially engaged, largely oppositional left-wing-page ecosystem, Clinton\u2019s message and cautious brand didn\u2019t carry.)Because the Sanders campaign has come to an end, these sites have been left in a peculiar position, having lost their unifying figure as well as their largest source of engagement. Audiences grow quickly on Facebook but can disappear even more quickly; in the case of left-leaning pages, many had accumulated followings not just by speaking to Sanders supporters but also by being intensely critical, and often utterly dismissive, of Clinton.\u201cIt\u2019s like a meme war,\u201d Rivero says, \u201cand politics is being won and lost on social media.\u201dThis was, for most news organizations, a boon. The flood of visitors aligned with two core goals of most media companies: to reach people and to make money. But as Facebook\u2019s growth continued, its influence was intensified by broader trends in internet use, primarily the use of smartphones, on which Facebook became more deeply enmeshed with users\u2019 daily routines. Soon, it became clear that Facebook wasn\u2019t just a source of readership; it was, increasingly, where readers lived.Facebook, from a publisher\u2019s perspective, had seized the web\u2019s means of distribution by popular demand. A new reality set in, as a social-media network became an intermediary between publishers and their audiences. For media companies, the ability to reach an audience is fundamentally altered, made greater in some ways and in others more challenging. For a dedicated Facebook user, a vast array of sources, spanning multiple media and industries, is now processed through the same interface and sorting mechanism, alongside updates from friends, family, brands and celebrities.From the start, some publishers cautiously regarded Facebook as a resource to be used only to the extent that it supported their existing businesses, wary of giving away more than they might get back. Others embraced it more fully, entering into formal partnerships for revenue sharing and video production, as The New York Times has done. Some new-media start-ups, most notably BuzzFeed, have pursued a comprehensively Facebook-centric production-and-distribution strategy. All have eventually run up against the same reality: A company that can claim nearly every internet-using adult as a user is less a partner than a context \u2014 a self-contained marketplace to which you have been granted access but which functions according to rules and incentives that you cannot control.The news feed is designed, in Facebook\u2019s public messaging, to \u201cshow people the stories most relevant to them\u201d and ranks stories \u201cso that what\u2019s most important to each person shows up highest in their news feeds.\u201d It is a framework built around personal connections and sharing, where value is both expressed and conferred through the concept of engagement. Of course, engagement, in one form or another, is what media businesses have always sought, and provocation has always sold news. But now the incentives are literalized in buttons and written into software.Readers who clicked through to the story were led to an external website, called Make America Great Today, where they were presented with a brief write-up blended almost seamlessly into a solid wall of fleshy ads. Khan, the story said \u2014 between ads for \u201c(1) Odd Trick to \u2018Kill\u2019 Herpes Virus for Good\u201d and \u201c22 Tank Tops That Aren\u2019t Covering Anything\u201d \u2014 is an agent of the Muslim Brotherhood and a \u201cpromoter of Islamic Shariah law.\u201d His late son, the story suggests, could have been a \u201cMuslim martyr\u201d working as a double agent. A credit link beneath the story led to a similar-looking site called Conservative Post, from which the story\u2019s text was pulled verbatim. Conservative Post had apparently sourced its story from a longer post on a right-wing site called Shoebat.com.Within 24 hours, the post was shared more than 3,500 times, collecting a further 3,000 reactions \u2014 thumbs-up likes, frowning emoji, angry emoji \u2014 as well as 850 comments, many lengthy and virtually all impassioned. A modest success. Each day, according to Facebook\u2019s analytics, posts from the Make America Great page are seen by 600,000 to 1.7 million people. In July, articles posted to the page, which has about 450,000 followers, were shared, commented on or liked more than four million times, edging out, for example, the Facebook page of USA Today.Nicoloff\u2019s business model is not dissimilar from the way most publishers use Facebook: build a big following, post links to articles on an outside website covered in ads and then hope the math works out in your favor. For many, it doesn\u2019t: Content is expensive, traffic is unpredictable and website ads are both cheap and alienating to readers. But as with most of these Facebook-native pages, Nicoloff\u2019s content costs comparatively little, and the sheer level of interest in Trump and in the type of inflammatory populist rhetoric he embraces has helped tip Nicoloff\u2019s system of advertising arbitrage into serious profitability. In July, visitors arriving to Nicoloff\u2019s website produced a little more than $30,000 in revenue. His costs, he said, total around $8,000, partly split between website hosting fees and advertising buys on Facebook itself.Terry Littlepage, an internet marketer based in Las Cruces, N.M., has taken this model even further. He runs a collection of about 50 politically themed Facebook pages with names like The American Patriot and My Favorite Gun, which push visitors to a half-dozen external websites, stocked with content aggregated by a team of freelancers. He estimates that he spends about a thousand dollars a day advertising his pages on Facebook; as a result, they have more than 10 million followers. In a good month, Littlepage\u2019s properties bring in $60,000.Nicoloff and Littlepage say that Trump has been good for business, but each admits to some discomfort. Nicoloff, a conservative, says that there were other candidates he preferred during the Republican primaries but that he had come around to the nominee. Littlepage is also a recent convert. During the primaries, he was a Cruz supporter, and he even tried making some left-wing pages on Facebook but discovered that they just didn\u2019t make him as much money.In their angry, cascading comment threads, Make America Great\u2019s followers express no such ambivalence. Nearly every page operator I spoke to was astonished by the tone their commenters took, comparing them to things like torch-wielding mobs and sharks in a feeding frenzy. No doubt because of the page\u2019s name, some Trump supporters even mistake Nicoloff\u2019s page for an official organ of the campaign. Nicoloff says that he receives dozens of messages a day from Trump supporters, expecting or hoping to reach the man himself. Many, he says, are simply asking for money.A dozen or so of the sites are published in-house, but posts from the company\u2019s small team of writers are free to be shared among the entire network. The deal for a would-be Liberty Alliance member is this: You bring the name and the audience, and the company will build you a prefab site, furnish it with ads, help you fill it with content and keep a cut of the revenue. Coca told me the company brought in $12 million in revenue last year. (The company declined to share documentation further corroborating his claims about followers and revenue.)Because the pages are run independently, the editorial product is varied. But it is almost universally tuned to the cadences and styles that seem to work best on partisan Facebook. It also tracks closely to conservative Facebook media\u2019s big narratives, which, in turn, track with the Trump campaign\u2019s messaging: Hillary Clinton is a crook and possibly mentally unfit; ISIS is winning; Black Lives Matter is the real racist movement; Donald Trump alone can save us; the system \u2014 all of it \u2014 is rigged. Whether the Liberty Alliance succeeds or fails will depend, at least in part, on Facebook\u2019s algorithm. Systemic changes to the ecosystem arrive through algorithmic adjustments, and the company recently adjusted the news feed to \u201cfurther reduce clickbait headlines.\u201dFor now, the network hums along, mostly beneath the surface. A post from a Liberty Alliance page might find its way in front of a left-leaning user who might disagree with it or find it offensive, and who might choose to engage with the friend who posted it directly. But otherwise, such news exists primarily within the feeds of the already converted, its authorship obscured, its provenance unclear, its veracity questionable. It\u2019s an environment that\u2019s at best indifferent and at worst hostile to traditional media brands; but for this new breed of page operator, it\u2019s mostly upside. In front of largely hidden and utterly sympathetic audiences, incredible narratives can take shape, before emerging, mostly formed, into the national discourse.Before Hannity signed off, he posed a question: \u201cSo, does that mean anything?\u201d It\u2019s a version of the question that everyone wants to answer about Facebook and politics, which is whether the site\u2019s churning political warfare is actually changing minds \u2014 or, for that matter, beginning to change the political discourse as a whole. How much of what happens on the platform is a reflection of a political mood and widely held beliefs, simply captured in a new medium, and how much of it might be created, or intensified, by the environment it provides? What is Facebook doing to our politics?Appropriately, the answer to this question can be chosen and shared on Facebook in whichever way you prefer. You might share this story from The New York Times Magazine, wondering aloud to your friends whether our democracy has been fundamentally altered by this publishing-and-advertising platform of unprecedented scale. Or you might just relax and find some memes to share from one of countless pages that will let you air your political id. But for the page operators, the question is irrelevant to the task at hand. Facebook\u2019s primacy is a foregone conclusion, and the question of Facebook\u2019s relationship to political discourse is absurd \u2014 they\u2019re one and the same. As Rafael Rivero put it to me, \u201cFacebook is where it\u2019s all happening.\u201dJohn Herrman is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}

To find success in America, its parent company has ignored China, its home market and a country with 700 million internet users.The reason is simple, says Alex Zhu, co-founder of Shanghai-based Musical.ly: China\u2019s internet is fundamentally different from the one used in much of the rest of the world.\u201cIt\u2019s still very difficult to get into China,\u201d said Mr. Zhu, who studied civil engineering at Zhejiang University in the eastern city of Hangzhou. \u201cIt\u2019s a closed environment, and you have to be quite different to compete in that market.\u201dFor China\u2019s web companies, the divide may have even more significant implications.It has penned in the country\u2019s biggest and most innovative internet companies. Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent have grown to be some of the world\u2019s largest internet companies, but they rely almost entirely on domestic businesses. Their ventures abroad have been mostly desultory, and prognostications that they will challenge American giants internationally have not materialized.For Chinese web start-ups like Musical.ly, the internet split has also forced them to choose \u2014 either create something that caters to China\u2019s digital population or focus on the rest of the globe.In many ways, the split is like 19th century railroads in the United States, when rails of different sizes hindered a train\u2019s ability to go from one place to another.\u201cThe barrier to entering the U.S. or China market is becoming higher and higher,\u201d said Kai-fu Lee, a venture investor from Taiwan and former head of Google China.In 2012, armed with a cash stockpile of several hundred million dollars, the world soccer star Lionel Messi as a spokesman and local ads like Bollywood-inspired commercials in India, Tencent began a push that executives said would be its best chance of breaking out of China. The effort flopped.Critics pointed to Tencent\u2019s lack of distinctive marketing, a record of censorship and surveillance in China and its late arrival to foreign markets. Yet the biggest problem was that outside of China, WeChat was just not the same. Within China, WeChat can be used to do almost everything, like pay bills, hail a taxi, book a doctor\u2019s appointment, share photos and chat. Yet its ability to do that is dependent on other Chinese internet services that are limited outside the country.That leaves WeChat outside China as an app that people mostly use to chat and share photos \u2014 not that different from WhatsApp and Messenger, which are both owned by Facebook. Baidu and Alibaba have apps that similarly offer a range of capabilities, yet are less useful outside China.The same problem hurts start-ups in China. Those companies start out accustomed to using Chinese internet sites and apps to market and enhance their business. But going abroad means a different world of services to master, such as a solid understanding of Facebook and Google\u2019s platforms and ads, not Baidu\u2019s and Tencent\u2019s.By contrast, Musical.ly chose the opposite approach and linked itself to the most popular social networks in the United States. If someone records an impressively coordinated dance or flawlessly lip-synced song, the person can put it up not just on the app, but also add it to Instagram, send it on WhatsApp or post it to Facebook. That has helped Musical.ly grow naturally to Europe, South America and Southeast Asia, Mr. Zhu said.\u201cThe thing about this young generation in the U.S. is, they\u2019re creative,\u201d said Mr. Zhu. \u201cThey\u2019ll say, \u2018Please follow me on Instagram or Snapchat.\u2019 If your app can attract some people in an age group and make them super excited to share, you will probably grow.\u201dFor Cheetah Mobile, a maker of smartphone utility apps based in Beijing whose users are mostly outside China, the solution was finding a steppingstone to the rest of the world. In early 2014, it opened an office in Taiwan, where use of Google and Facebook dominates. That helped it gain employees who intimately understood Facebook, YouTube and other major Western platforms that could be used for advertising.\u201cTaiwan served as a bridge for us across the Pacific to the United States,\u201d said Charles Fan, Cheetah\u2019s chief technology officer.Tencent, Alibaba and Baidu have all opened American offices, but they have mostly turned to investments and acquisitions to gain footholds overseas. Over the last two years, Alibaba has invested in emerging markets, including two online commerce companies, Paytm and Snapdeal, in India. It also spent $1 billion to acquire Lazada, an e-commerce site popular in Southeast Asia.Perhaps the greatest indication of Tencent\u2019s overseas ambitions was a deal that never happened. In 2014, with its global WeChat campaign faltering, it was preparing to start negotiations to bid for WhatsApp when Facebook swooped in, according to a senior Tencent executive who asked for anonymity in discussing corporate strategy.Tencent and Baidu declined to comment. An Alibaba spokeswoman referred to recent remarks by Alibaba\u2019s president, J. Michael Evans, in which he pointed to acquisitions as a way the company was attracting new consumers in developing markets. He also said Alibaba was focused on attracting more foreign businesses to sell on its markets in China.Mr. Lee said it might take a new technological jump for Chinese companies to get a chance at building a platform inside China and internationally. He said Chinese companies could prove competitive in emerging sectors like virtual reality, artificial intelligence and robotics.\u201cI think what might be surprising is, China will catch up rapidly,\u201d he said. \u201cPartly because of Chinese universities, partly because of returnees to China who form a portion of the top engineers in the world.\u201dMusical.ly is in many ways a product of the cultural exchange between the United States and China that Mr. Lee described. Mr. Zhu, 37, graduated from a Chinese university, but moved to the United States with the German software company SAP in 2010. He had the idea for the music app while riding the train from San Francisco to Mountain View, Calif., in a car full of high school students.\u201cHalf were listening to music and the other half were using their phone to take photos and add emojis, and they were passing them around,\u201d Mr. Zhu said. Then it hit him: combine the selfie and social media part with the music part and turn it into one product. In 2015, Mr. Zhu moved to Shanghai, where his co-founder has been based since Musical.ly\u2019s 2013 inception.Yet Musical.ly is unlikely to be the social network to link both sides of the Pacific. For the demographic the app is focusing on, it\u2019s far better to be outside its home market, Mr. Zhu said.\u201cTeenagers in the U.S. are a golden audience,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at China, the teenage culture doesn\u2019t exist \u2014 the teens are super busy in school studying for tests, so they don\u2019t have the time and luxury to play social media apps.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Go\u2019o remained in custody on Thursday, but the police said he had admitted being distracted by the game when the accident occurred. Photographs and video taken by the Japanese news media showed what they said was the van driven by Mr. Go\u2019o, with a smashed windshield.Niantic, a spinoff of Google that is responsible for the design of Pok\u00e9mon Go, has added in-game warnings against playing while driving or in other potentially dangerous situations, and a spokesman said the company prioritized safety. Nintendo, which is based in Japan and owns part of the company that manages the Pok\u00e9mon franchise, said it was working to \u201ccreate an environment where people can play the game safely.\u201dMore than 10 million people in Japan downloaded the game on the day it debuted here last month, after a similarly huge reception in the United States and elsewhere.

{"Headline": "\u2018It Absolutely Has Created Fear\u2019: 2 Killings Prompt Female Joggers to Alter Routines", "Date": "2016-08-09", "News": "Supported byThe two deaths occurred just days apart and had eerily similar details \u2014 each time, a woman went jogging during the day in an isolated area and wound up dead.Though one woman\u2019s body was discovered in Massachusetts and the other in Queens, and the authorities do not believe the two attacks were related, the killings have unnerved many female runners. Some are now rethinking their routines.Around 1:15 p.m. on Sunday, Vanessa Marcotte, 27, left her mother\u2019s home in Princeton, Mass., to go for a run on a wooded country road nearby, according to a spokesman with the Worcester County district attorney\u2019s office. Ms. Marcotte was visiting town from her home in New York City, where she worked as a Google marketing account manager.After she had been gone for more than two and a half hours, the police began looking for Ms. Marcotte. Later that night, a State Police canine unit found her body about a half-mile from her mother\u2019s home. The police began a homicide investigation, but have not made any arrests. An autopsy report had not been completed as of Tuesday afternoon.Police officials in New York said they did not believe the episode was related to the death last Tuesday of Karina Vetrano, 30, in the Howard Beach neighborhood. Ms. Vetrano was sexually assaulted and strangled during a run in a nature preserve near her home, the police said.The news of the two joggers\u2019 deaths has prompted anxiety among female runners in New York City and caused many to question their safety while running alone.\u201cIt absolutely has created fear,\u201d said Kathy Ioannou, leader of the Brooklyn chapter of She Runs This Town, a running group for women. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel comfortable running alone. We\u2019re frightened.\u201dMs. Ioannou, 51, said she had seen a \u201chuge spike\u201d in the last two days of women from her group asking her to set up more group runs so that members did not have to go alone.She has made changes to her own running route, choosing to run in the street against traffic instead of in the golf course near her home in Dyker Heights, Brooklyn. She has also stopped running with headphones and has not left the house without her Road ID, which contains her emergency contact information.In search of long stretches of continuous road, many runners venture to unfamiliar places so they can log more miles. Ms. Ioannou said she had been planning on going to the Howard Beach area for an 18-mile run before she heard about the attack there.\u201cIt brought light to all of us that we just can\u2019t do the things we\u2019re used to doing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t fair, but it\u2019s smart.\u201dAs the peak of the marathon season approaches, many women are leaving home early in the morning \u2014 sometimes while it is still dark \u2014 to try to squeeze long runs into their schedules, said Melody Davis, a Brooklyn resident and a member of the group Black Girls Run.\u201cWhat\u2019s really unnerving is that both of these latest situations happened in daylight,\u201d Ms. Davis said. \u201cThe question becomes, Then when can I go run?\u201dSome members of her group have suggested using phone apps that can map runners\u2019 locations so that relatives can track their whereabouts. Others have been resorting to running in groups or with a dog, she said.Gisela Perez, a Bronx resident, said she carried Mace and sometimes a safety pin to be used as a possible weapon in case of an emergency while running. She said she also tried to avoid going by herself. For other runners, like Martha Rowen, 73, jogging in groups is not an easy alternative; Ms. Rowen, who lives in Brooklyn Heights, said she had a hard time keeping up with younger runners.\u201cIt\u2019s going to probably influence how likely I am to branch out,\u201d Ms. Rowen said about the recent attacks. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m going to be able to feel I can do that.\u201dBut the killings of both Ms. Vetrano and Ms. Marcotte seem to have taken place in areas they were familiar with. And both were avid runners.The Landmark, a newspaper based in Holden, Mass., reported that in 2014, Ms. Marcotte ran in a race to raise money for cancer research, in honor of her uncle. On Tuesday, one friend posted a photo of herself and Ms. Marcotte on Facebook taking part in a race together.For the past year and a half, Ms. Marcotte had been working as an account manager in health care at Google\u2019s New York City office, according to her LinkedIn profile. In a statement, a Google spokeswoman said Ms. Marcotte was \u201cknown for her ubiquitous smile, passion for volunteer work and love of Boston sports.\u201dMs. Marcotte graduated from Boston University's College of Communication in 2011, her LinkedIn profile says, and worked in Boston before moving to New York. Several of her family and friends declined to comment.Jeff Esposito, who lives in the Boston area, worked with Ms. Marcotte for about two years at Vistaprint, a marketing company. He said Ms. Marcotte loved being outside and exercising. \u201cVanessa was a true treat to work with,\u201d he said. \u201cShe is somebody who will be truly, truly missed.\u201dMs. Davis, the runner in Brooklyn, said she hoped that the deaths of Ms. Marcotte and Ms. Vetrano would not stop women from wanting to get outside and run.\u201cI want ladies in our community to continue to do what they love,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want fear to be another deterrent.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about reactions by female runners to the recent killings of two women who were jogging misidentified a jogger who said she carries safety pins as a possible weapon. She is Gisela Perez, not Melody Davis. The article also referred incorrectly to the area where the body of Vanessa Marcotte was discovered. She was found about a half-mile from her mother\u2019s home in Princeton, Mass., not about a mile and a half from there.Susan C. Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Was Shostakovich a Martyr? Or Is That Just Fiction?", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNovelists have every right to use historical data to lend their works verisimilitude, and they are free to go beyond the facts, wherever their fancy leads them. Historians, though, are bound by circumstances, condemned to whatever partial, obstructed view their sources grant them. Their only recourse is to keep on looking and pray. Meanwhile, novelists can soar and gain an untrammeled vista.This book, I think, is a beautifully written botch, and it has me wondering anew about truth. People have been doing that, of course, for a long time \u2014 at least since Pilate confronted Christ. And the wrangling over what the truth might be about Shostakovich and his experiences under Stalin has been going on, it sometimes seems, almost as long.The fallacy of such thinking is to regard that essential truth as something revealed rather than created. Tolstoy did not make that mistake. He knew that the difference between real and fictional worlds is that a fictional world is wholly known. Nothing could remain hidden from Tolstoy about his imaginary Napoleonic Russia and its Natashas, Pierres and Andreis. But no matter how diligently he or we may burrow in the archives, there will always be more documents somewhere; some may contradict the ones we know, and there is no end to what was never recorded to begin with.So why, then, is Shostakovich given his own name in \u201cThe Noise of Time\u201d (as are all the other characters)? If Mr. Barnes had called his hero, say, Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov and let the reader divine the resemblance to Shostakovich, I would accept his work without demur. But Mr. Barnes evidently wanted to capitalize on the interest that frenzied debate has drummed up in his subject and to claim implicitly to have settled the issues concerning the composer\u2019s relationship with Soviet power, which scholars continue to dispute. In an author\u2019s note appended to the novel, he advertises his fidelity to his sources and his superior insights. He is trying to have it both ways: He wants the novelist\u2019s freedom and also the historian\u2019s authority. But in trying for both, he achieves neither.Mr. Barnes\u2019s view of Shostakovich conforms in every detail to the sentimental Cold War fable of a passive, pathetic yet saintly figure buffeted by an obtuse, implacable force. This stereotype goes beyond Shostakovich and beyond his music, all the way to music itself, imagined as pure and spotless, utterly truthful the way mathematics is truthful, unresistant to martyrdom and co-option but ultimately triumphant. These are the na\u00efve assumptions of pop Romanticism.The sources on which Mr. Barnes most conspicuously relies are the two canonical texts of the Shostakovich wars. One is \u201cTestimony,\u201d a best-seller that appeared in 1979 whose subtitle is \u201cThe Memoirs of Dmitri Shostakovich as Related to and Edited by Solomon Volkov\u201d; the other is the invaluable \u201cShostakovich: A Life Remembered\u201d (1994) by Elizabeth Wilson, a compendium of third-person accounts by people who knew the composer. Mr. Volkov\u2019s book (despite the seductive, still widely believed stories it promulgates) has been exposed as a mixture of recycled material that Shostakovich had approved for republication and fabrications that were inserted after his death. The other makes no truth claims but presents a great gabble of conflicting viewpoints from which we are invited to draw our own conclusions.Mr. Barnes has done just that. But the remarkable, disappointing fact is that his fictional Shostakovich is not his own invention. He has adopted a ready-made: the sinless version of Shostakovich peddled by \u201cTestimony,\u201d supplemented by the most lurid tales from Ms. Wilson\u2019s argosy and a published letter or two. The resulting narrative predictably recycles three mangy tales from the Shostakovich wars.The first concerns the anonymous Pravda editorial of Jan. 28, 1936, \u201cMuddle Instead of Music,\u201d which denounced Shostakovich\u2019s wildly successful opera \u201cThe Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District.\u201d It not only led to a ban on the opera but also, according to legend, put the composer under a cloud of suspicion that brought him within a hair\u2019s breadth of being \u201crepressed,\u201d as the saying went, in the Stalinist purges of 1936-38.The second recycled tale relates to the Cultural and Scientific Conference for World Peace, held in March 1949 at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York, where Shostakovich, fresh from a second denunciation at the hands of Andrei Zhdanov, Stalin\u2019s culture czar, was supposedly sent against his will as part of the Soviet delegation, only to be humiliated again in a confrontation with the composer Nicolas Nabokov.A decade later, as the third saga would have it, Nikita Khrushchev had Shostakovich browbeaten into joining the Soviet Communist Party so that he could serve as titular head of the Russian Federation\u2019s Union of Soviet Composers, after which the composer was supposedly so demoralized and filled with shame that he wrote a string quartet about it: his Eighth, often regarded as his masterpiece. All of its themes are derived from Shostakovich\u2019s initials, bearing witness to his own standing among the 20th century\u2019s \u201cvictims of war and fascism,\u201d in the words of the quartet\u2019s dedication.These three tales \u2014 the three books, so to speak, of the Shostakovich Apocrypha \u2014 correspond exactly to the three chapters of \u201cThe Noise of Time,\u201d and there is nothing in Mr. Barnes\u2019s account that cannot be found in the dubious sources he cites. His open fictionalization achieves nothing beyond what previous covert fictionalizations, like Mr. Volkov\u2019s, did.To see Shostakovich as a passive pawn in Stalin\u2019s clutches at the Waldorf does scant justice to a man whose collisions with power had taught him to play a complicated game with exceeding, self-concealing skill. In his one well-documented person-to-person encounter with Stalin, the phone call through which the dictator sought to coerce the composer\u2019s presence in New York, Shostakovich leveraged the world fame that made him indispensable to secure a lifting of the ban on his own and his colleagues\u2019 works that followed the \u201cformalist\u201d denunciations the previous year.After his return from abroad, Shostakovich paid the powers back with a pair of often derided tribute works, an oratorio called \u201cSong of the Forests\u201d and the soundtrack score for the film \u201cThe Fall of Berlin.\u201d As the British musicologist Pauline Fairclough has shown in a patient analysis, they are no worse than the works of Shostakovich we now treat with respect. The Shostakovich of history did not write badly for them and well for himself. No one writes badly on purpose, nor could anyone make a career as successful as the one Shostakovich made in Soviet Russia while maintaining the kind of moral and aesthetic purity his mythologizers attribute to him. No one makes a successful career anywhere without learning and executing an intricate social dance.As for his official co-option, there is no reason to think that Shostakovich sought either the Party membership or the Union leadership that the government thrust upon him. But once in possession of political power, Shostakovich behaved not like a saint but like a politician. As his recently published official correspondence shows, he was not above settling scores.In 1948, one of the worst things anyone said about him at the hearings that preceded the Central Committee\u2019s \u201cResolution on Music\u201d came from Vladimir Zakharov, the director of the Pyatnitsky Choir, the Soviet Union\u2019s leading song-and-dance ensemble. \u201cFrom the point of view of the People,\u201d Zakharov taunted, Shostakovich\u2019s Eighth Symphony \u201cis not a musical work at all; it is a \u2018composition\u2019 which has nothing whatever to do with the art of music.\u201dAt the very first Union meeting over which he presided as chair, Shostakovich paid back his tormentor (posthumously) with a scorching attack on the choir\u2019s repertory, which still consisted mainly of Zakharov arrangements. To one of the ensemble\u2019s then-active arrangers he wrote that the hapless fellow\u2019s setting of one particularly famous song \u201chas nothing in common with the art of music,\u201d echoing nearly verbatim Zakharov\u2019s old insult. Yes, his hands, too, were dirty. Everyone\u2019s were.The author of \u201cThe Porcupine\u201d knew that. What lured Mr. Barnes into hagiography when Shostakovich became his subject? Were I a novelist, I would speculate.Richard Taruskin is professor emeritus of music at the University of California, Berkeley. His \u201cRussian Music at Home and Abroad\u201d will appear this fall.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.E., the 124-Year-Old Software Start-Up", "Date": "2016-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt may not qualify as a lightning-bolt eureka moment, but Jeffrey R. Immelt, chief executive of General Electric, recalls the June day in 2009 that got him thinking. He was speaking with G.E. scientists about new jet engines they were building, laden with sensors to generate a trove of data from every flight \u2014 but to what end?That data could someday be as valuable as the machinery itself, if not more so. But G.E. couldn\u2019t make use of it.But in 2011, G.E. also quietly opened a software center in San Ramon, Calif., 24 miles east of San Francisco, across the bay.Today one of San Ramon\u2019s most important projects is to build a computer operating system, but on an industrial scale \u2014 a Microsoft Windows or Google Android for factories and industrial equipment. The project is central to G.E.\u2019s drive to become what Mr. Immelt says will be a \u201ctop 10 software company\u201d by 2020.Silicon Valley veterans are skeptical.Many industries see digital threats, of course. Yet the scope of the challenge is magnified at G.E., a 124-year-old company and the nation\u2019s largest manufacturer, with more than 300,000 employees worldwide. Employees companywide have been making pilgrimages to San Ramon for technology briefings, but also to soak in the culture. Their marching orders are to try to adapt the digital wizardry and hurry-up habits of Silicon Valley to G.E.\u2019s world of industrial manufacturing.6 PhotosG.E.\u2019s success or failure over the next decade, Mr. Immelt says, depends on this transformation. He calls it \u201cprobably the most important thing I\u2019ve worked on in my career.\u201dApparently, there is no Plan B. \u201cIt\u2019s this or bust,\u201d he said.The march of digital technology \u2014 mainly inexpensive sensors, powerful computing and clever software \u2014 into the industrial world has been underway for years under the guise of \u201cthe internet of things\u201d or \u201cthe industrial internet.\u201d It is the next battlefield as companies fight to develop the dominant software layer that connects the machines.It promises to be a huge market for new products, improved service and efficiency gains in industries like energy, transportation and health care. By 2020, the industrial internet market will reach $225 billion, G.E. executives predicted in a recent meeting with analysts.So far, a major application has been predictive maintenance. Software analyzes the data generated by a machine to identify early warning signals that it needs repair, before it breaks down.The data volumes are exploding as machines new and old spawn sensors. By 2020, G.E. estimates that the data flowing off its machines in use will jump a hundredfold. That should enable far more detailed analysis, giving G.E. a chance to sell its customers not machines but \u201cbusiness outcomes,\u201d like fuel savings. Mr. Immelt sees this as a move up the industrial food chain.Yet all of this exposes G.E. to new competition beyond its traditional rivals like Rockwell Automation, Siemens and United Technologies. Tech giants, including Amazon, Cisco, Google, IBM and Microsoft also have their eye on the industrial internet market, as do a bevy of start-ups.There is precedent for trouble in other industries, of course. Google and Facebook transformed media and advertising, Amazon redefined retailing, and Uber applied an entirely new business model to taxis, which hadn\u2019t changed much in generations.\u201cThe real danger is that the data and analysis becomes worth more than the installed equipment itself,\u201d said Karim R. Lakhani, a professor at the Harvard Business School. \u201cG.E. has no choice but to try to do that itself.\u201dUntil this year, Darren Haas hadn\u2019t thought about G.E., certainly not working there. To him, G.E. meant little more than than kitchen appliances and light bulbs. \u201cI had no idea,\u201d Mr. Haas said.But he was intrigued after he met with Harel Kodesh, an expert in mobile and cloud computing who led teams at Microsoft and VMware, a maker of data-center software. Less than two years ago, Mr. Kodesh joined G.E., and he is now chief technology officer of GE Digital.That someone of Mr. Kodesh\u2019s caliber was a G.E. convert got Mr. Haas\u2019s attention. Then, Mr. Haas started grasping the role that G.E. equipment plays across the economy \u2014 in transportation, in hospitals \u2014 \u201ca whole world,\u201d he said. \u201cI found that really, really compelling.\u201dThe other thing Mr. Haas, 41, found appealing was the big computing challenge that lies ahead for the company. In May, he joined G.E. from Apple, where he was a member of the founding team at Siri, the voice-based digital assistant start-up Apple acquired in 2010. When he left Apple, Mr. Haas was head of cloud engineering, managing the computing engine behind Siri, iTunes and iCloud.At GE Digital, Mr. Haas has a similar title, head of platform cloud engineering, but in a different setting. He describes his job as applying modern software technology \u2014 machine learning, artificial intelligence and cloud computing \u2014 to the industrial arena. \u201cI\u2019ve got my work cut out for me,\u201d he said.Mr. Haas is working on the centerpiece of G.E.\u2019s software strategy, a product called Predix. Its evolution mirrors G.E.\u2019s software ambitions.Predix began as little more than a brand of software used by G.E. to service the gear it sells. One showcase use was in jet engines to do predictive maintenance, saving downtime. Around 2013, William Ruh, a former Cisco Systems executive brought in to put together the San Ramon software center, started expanding Predix to other G.E. industrial businesses.But that soon felt too small. The issue was \u201coutside disrupters,\u201d Mr. Ruh said, citing the online lodging start-up Airbnb as an example of rivals that can appear seemingly out of nowhere and that \u201cbring greater productivity \u2014 but don\u2019t own the assets they sell.\u201d G.E., Mr. Ruh notes, is the ultimate big-asset company.The other threat was rising interest among tech companies to take their internet connectivity expertise and try to apply it to industrial businesses. To get ahead of all this, G.E. reimagined Predix as a cloud-based operating system for industrial applications.Mr. Kodesh leads that effort. He ticks off the looming competitors: Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and others. \u201cThose companies are going to encroach on the territory,\u201d Mr. Kodesh said. \u201cAre we going to capitulate, or build something like Predix?\u201dThe basic idea is that G.E. and outside software developers will write programs to run on Predix. This software might, for instance, monitor the health and fine-tune the operation of equipment like oil-field rigs and wind-farm turbines, improving performance, reducing wear and adapting to changing environmental conditions. It amounts to software delivering the equivalent of personalized medicine for machines.Like any other computer operating system, Predix aims to take the complexity out of writing programs, so more people can create them. And while the instincts of the industrial world are proprietary, G.E. is following an open-source model with Predix, providing a basic design, but one open to outside contributors \u2014 more like Android from Google than Windows from Microsoft.Predix, Mr. Kodesh said, will be improved using the software equivalent of Lego blocks. \u201cSome will be G.E.\u2019s, and some will be made by third-party developers,\u201d he said.G.E. is betting that its deep knowledge of industry will give it an edge in this software arms race. The stakes for this kind of programming can be high.For a regular consumer using the internet, a misfiring algorithm in the software \u2014 \u201ca false positive\u201d \u2014 might mean a person sees an irrelevant online ad, or a bad Amazon book suggestion or Netflix movie recommendation, Mr. Kodesh said. Useless, perhaps, but not necessarily costly. But a false positive that prompts an airline to take a jet engine off the wing, Mr. Kodesh said, is a $100,000 mistake.\u201cWe really do need to have different technology, different algorithms and a different cloud, than in the consumer internet,\u201d he said.G.E. has set an ambitious target for Predix. It hopes to attract $100 million in orders this year, on its way to $4 billion in revenue by 2020. By then, the company forecasts that its total digital business \u2014 more than 90 percent of it software \u2014 may reach as much as $15 billion, up from $6 billion now.For Predix to reach its potential, though, G.E. needs outside programmers to write software for it. The company, with its deep pockets, can start the software-writing parade, but will others follow?This will be a major test. And G.E.\u2019s campaign to build an industrial operating system and create a flourishing ecosystem of software for it is just getting underway in earnest.In late July, G.E. hosted a Predix conference in Las Vegas, which attracted 1,200 software developers. Such developer gatherings are part of the playbook of every major software company but unusual for an industrial corporation.G.E. has some built-in advantages. Its installed base is huge. For example, the company says more than a third of the world\u2019s electricity is generated on G.E. equipment. It can make progress simply by winning over the aircraft makers, oil companies, hospitals and utilities that now depend on G.E. machinery.G.E. is starting to attract a developer following. Tata Consultancy Services, for one, says it now has 500 programmers designing and developing Predix applications for customers in the electric-utility, aviation and health care industries. G.E. also promotes partnerships with Infosys, Wipro and Capgemini to help business write Predix software.When he joined in 2011, Mr. Ruh had no illusions that making software a strength at a heavy-industry company would be easy. At the time, he told Mr. Immelt that would be \u201ca 10-year journey,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of that journey.\u201dPart of that is an effort to change an engineering culture that stretches back generations. \u201cIf G.E. is truly going to be a digital-industrial company, we can\u2019t be separate here,\u201d Mr. Ruh said of his software division. Digital \u201ctools and habits\u201d need to be embedded \u201cin how people do their jobs,\u201d he said.In its factory in Greenville, S.C., G.E. produces both giant power generators and evidence that this metamorphosis might work.The three-story building is crowded with immense cranes and milling, grinding and welding machines, overseen by manufacturing engineers and technicians. The finishing touches are being put on one of G.E.\u2019s new gas turbines.It looks like the business end of a rocket ship lying on its side, a gleaming steel dynamo at rest. It weighs 950,000 pounds. It fires up at nearly 2,900 degrees Fahrenheit, and it can generate enough electricity to supply more than 500,000 households.The gas turbine was brought to market in half the typical five years. That kind of accelerated product development is a performance that G.E. hopes to replicate across its industrial businesses. And it is a story of changes in design and manufacturing practices made possible by digital technology.John Lammas, the 56-year-old vice president for power generation engineering, started his working career 40 years ago, on the shop floor of a Rolls-Royce jet engine factory in Birmingham, England. He has been with G.E. for 31 years, moving up the ranks of the company\u2019s jet engine and power turbine divisions.\u201cI\u2019m an old mechanical guy,\u201d he said. But a couple of years ago, he issued an edict: no more paper drawings.In the past, a model of a new part would be made and then converted to detailed blueprints running to 70 pages or more. These would then be physically sent to G.E. manufacturing engineers and outside suppliers to begin setting up the tooling, casting and cutting for the part.This prototype-and-blueprint routine took up to eight weeks. Now, engineers use 3-D computer models, skip the prototype step and instantly send the models electronically.This goes a step beyond computer-aided design, which is commonplace. In Greenville, the designers are for the first time linked directly with manufacturers and suppliers in real time, in what G.E. calls a \u201cdigital thread.\u201d This means they can collaborate in ways that have changed the work process while making it more likely that problems or defects are spotted sooner.Traditionally, one set of engineers designed a part, and only then passed it on to manufacturing. If a problem arose on the supplier side, the design was kicked back and the process started over. \u201cJobs are combining in this digital world,\u201d Mr. Lammas said.Greenville\u2019s own equipment has been a Predix guinea pig. The machinery and factory were retrofitted with data-generating sensors and the software. Matt Krause, the plant manager, said that last winter, when a snowstorm shut the factory for a day, the sensor network detected that the plant had consumed 1,000 pounds of argon, an inert gas used in coatings for parts. The leak was fixed, saving $350,000 a year.\u201cWe can see things we never did before,\u201d Mr. Krause said. Over all, 60 of 200 steps in design and production have been automated or eliminated, reducing work time by 530,000 hours over three years, G.E. estimates.Not all the start-up ideas that G.E. is trying to breed translate comfortably to heavy industry. Lean proponents urge companies to come up with \u201cminimum viable products,\u201d particularly test versions of software programs. But no one wants a minimum viable jet engine or power generator.Yet in Greenville, engineers in the design stages are encouraged to move faster in smaller steps, conduct more experiments, and be willing to fail and try again. It amounts to a sea change in the engineering culture of heavy industry.\u201cAs an engineer, not getting it right the first time, I find painful,\u201d said Bill Byrne, an engineering manager. \u201cIt\u2019s uncomfortable. But it\u2019s been incredibly liberating.\u201dThe old ways, said Mr. Lammas, the engineering chief, had merit. Each step and rule was logical on its own. But the emphasis on flawless execution and perfection fostered a fear of failure. \u201cOvercoming that culture was probably the biggest challenge,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shocker! Facebook Changes Its Algorithm to Avoid \u2018Clickbait\u2019", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacebook says it plans to marginalize what it considers to be \u201cclickbait\u201d news stories from publishers in its news feed, in another step to keep its 1.71 billion members regularly coming back to its social network.\u201cWe want publishers to post content that people care about, and we think people care about headlines that are much more straightforward,\u201d Adam Mosseri, Facebook\u2019s vice president for product management for the news feed, said in an interview.Thursday\u2019s announcement goes a step further. Facebook spent months classifying phrases commonly used in clickbait headlines. Mr. Mosseri offered examples like \u201cThe Dog Barked at the Deliveryman and His Reaction Was Priceless,\u201d or \u201cWhen She Looked Under Her Couch Cushions and Saw THIS \u2026 I Was SHOCKED!\u201dThe company\u2019s algorithms then took note of the websites from which the articles were coming, and could detect patterns of traffic coming from those sites over time. That process was then automated, and content identified as clickbait will now appear lower in the news feed than before. Mr. Mosseri likened the practice to a kind of email spam filtering process.The move will most likely heighten the anxiety of publishers that rely heavily on Facebook for traffic and often complain about having little insight into the company\u2019s decision-making on how its all-powerful algorithm functions.The social network\u2019s vast user base and sophisticated targeting capabilities allow publishers to reach new audiences far beyond the direct traffic a media company receives at its own site. As a result, Facebook has been able to largely dictate the terms on which it engages with publishers, which have few other options for distributing their articles.Julie Hansen, the president and chief operating officer of the online publication Business Insider, said it would take Facebook\u2019s latest algorithm change under consideration.\u201cWe don\u2019t do what we consider to be clickbaity headlines,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we\u2019ll certainly consider Facebook\u2019s guidance when we look to post our content onto Facebook and adapt the headlines if needed.\u201dFacebook said that publishers that have clickbaitlike headlines and are ranked lower because of the algorithm change will have the opportunity to change their ways and rise again in the rankings.Some publishers are now betting on a future beyond total reliance on Facebook, as companies like Snapchat and Google offer media companies other avenues to distribute their work.\u201cToday we\u2019re at peak Facebook \u2014 Facebook dominates everything,\u201d said Zachary Kaplan, a vice president at the investment firm General Atlantic, which has invested in digital media companies like BuzzFeed and Vox Media.\u201cWe will naturally evolve to a place where there will be more competition among digital distributors,\u201d he said, \u201cand that would result in, naturally, more leverage for publishers.\u201dFor now, Facebook said it planned to improve relationships with publishers by becoming more transparent about its news feed practices. Mr. Mosseri regularly meets with publishers to discuss algorithm changes.\u201cIt\u2019s becoming clear to us how there\u2019s a lot of anxiety over what we do,\u201d Mr. Mosseri said. \u201cI spend a lot of time trying to ease that anxiety.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rape, Race and the Jogger", "Date": "2016-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionWhen I ran cross-country in high school in California, I was well trained, well coached and professionally sized for my Asics racing flats. Running was a source of pleasurable vulnerability: I courted the limits of how much self-inflicted pain my body could handle, tracing the long curve of Santa Monica Bay, on the hard sand by the water, and the wealthy streets of Brentwood, past hedge-hidden homes. My runs were backlit by privilege.When I lived in Nicaragua in my early 20s, I was aware of myself as something of a spectacle when I went jogging. I lived in a town where most people supported themselves with physical labor, and they did not choose to spend the leisure time they rarely had running miles through the humid heat. The inclination toward voluntary physical exertion is one of jogging\u2019s many prerequisites: You need free time, decent shoes, possibly child care. Studies have routinely shown that those with money are much more likely to run for fun.In the last month, three female joggers \u2014 all of them white, all around 30 \u2014 have been murdered: Alexandra Brueger, a nurse in Michigan; Karina Vetrano, who worked at a restaurant in Howard Beach, Queens; and Vanessa Marcotte, a Google employee who was attacked while jogging on a bucolic stretch of wooded road near her mother\u2019s home in Massachusetts.Their deaths are horrifying, their families\u2019 grief unimaginable, and they make me aware of my own vulnerability \u2014 as a jogger, I guess, but mainly as a woman and a human being with an innately fragile body. Their deaths also make me aware of the fact that I have a body \u2014 female, white, 33 \u2014 readily understood as vulnerable. They come at the end of a summer marked by other killings \u2014 Alton Sterling, Philando Castile, Sylville Smith, all black men, all shot by police officers who imagined they were threats \u2014 that make me aware of the ways in which my body isn\u2019t vulnerable at all. I have been pulled over for traffic violations plenty of times, but I have never been shot while reaching for my license.It\u2019s impossible to talk about the figure of the vulnerable jogger in the American imagination without returning to the Central Park Jogger: an investment banker named Trisha Meili, 28 years old and white, who was raped and brutally beaten \u2014 allegedly by a \u201cwolf pack\u201d of black and Hispanic teenagers \u2014 in Central Park on April 19, 1989. During most of the media frenzy, Ms. Meili was simply known as \u201cthe jogger\u201d: \u201cTeen Gang Rapes Jogger\u201d; \u201cFemale Jogger Near Death.\u201dMs. Meili was called \u201cthe jogger\u201d to protect her anonymity, but the relentless recurrence of the title also affirmed the narrative the media had spun around her, which presented a character defined by youth and health, by ambition and upward mobility, by her desire to claim Central Park as a space of leisure \u2014 despite assertions that it wasn\u2019t safe after dark, especially above 96th Street \u2014 and by her refusal to capitulate to fear, by her determination to jog anyway. \u201cThe jogger\u201d had been exercising a kind of willpower people admired, but her willpower had been viciously punished, and people were hungry for more punishment in return.The boys accused of assaulting Ms. Meili \u2014 Kharey Wise, Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam and Raymond Santana, Jr. \u2014 were convicted on the strength of contradictory confessions coerced under duress. After an incarcerated serial rapist named Matias Reyes eventually confessed to the crime more than a decade later, a claim confirmed by DNA evidence, their convictions were vacated in 2002.In the early pages of her 2003 memoir, \u201cI Am the Central Park Jogger,\u201d a moving account of her recovery, Ms. Meili resists the standard first-person and refers to herself as \u201cthe jogger\u201d instead: \u201cIt is astonishing that the Jogger is alive,\u201d she writes about her own body, found in the woods north of the 102nd Street transverse, where she was hypothermic and barely breathing, gagged with a white shirt soaked red. She had lost 75 percent of her blood.Her third-person narrative is an elegant testimony to the fact that she still has no access to her own interior experience at that time \u2014 no memories of the night of the attack, nor the six weeks that followed it. She cannot remember being \u201cI\u201d in those moments. It\u2019s almost as if she is telling her story through the lens of the public\u2019s obsession with it: \u201cThe rape of a slim, seemingly frail, innocent woman,\u201d she writes, \u201cseems a rape of the city itself.\u201d She acknowledges the ways her vulnerability was part of her public image (\u201cfrail\u201d) but also resists understanding herself wholly in terms of this frailty (\u201cseemingly\u201d).The lead prosecutor in her case was a jogger as well: Elizabeth Lederer, a white woman in her 30s who ran the same Central Park trails as Ms. Meili. In her cross-examination of Mr. Salaam, trying to dispute his claim that he\u2019d gone into the park that night to \u201cwalk around,\u201d Ms. Lederer asked: \u201cDid you have jogging clothes on?\u201d She said: \u201cYou weren\u2019t going there for a picnic, were you?\u201dMs. Meili describes the fantasies of invulnerability that brought her to the park to run: \u201cI was indestructible, omnipotent. Comfortable. I could run and run and nothing and no one could harm me.\u201dThe Central Park Five had their own fantasies of invulnerability: They believed that because they were innocent, they wouldn\u2019t go to jail. They thought if they said what the police wanted them to say, they would go home. But instead they went to prison \u2014 where their own bodies, already vulnerable, became even more so. Kharey Wise was beaten up in the TV room at Rikers Island. Even after he was released, Raymond Santana still showered with his boxers on.*What is it about the imperiled silhouette of the young female jogger that grips the collective imagination with such force? I think it has something to do with the wholesomeness of jogging \u2014 the way it suggests capability, self-improvement, female autonomy \u2014 and the horror of witnessing its virtues violated.This has been a summer of vulnerable and brutalized bodies, a summer of unjust violence once again carried out in the guise of justice, a summer of fear and fear mongering. Our Republican presidential nominee is the same man who put out a full-page newspaper ad in 1989 calling for the reinstatement of the death penalty in the aftermath of the Central Park Jogger\u2019s attack. \u201cI want them to understand our anger,\u201d he wrote, about the boys whose guilt he assumed. \u201cI want them to be afraid.\u201dThey were afraid, and their mothers were afraid, and each one of them came of age behind bars, for a crime he didn\u2019t commit.In the documentary \u201cThe Central Park Five,\u201d Angela Cuffee, the sister of the defendant Kevin Richardson, says: \u201cPatricia Meili, my brother, all the boys, all of our families \u2014 all of us are victims.\u201d She doesn\u2019t conflate the experiences of the jogger and the boys persecuted in her name, but she does ask us to recognize their violations as part of the same story: We responded to unjust violence by demanding more of it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Back-to-School Divide: $195 Headbands and $1 Glue Sticks", "Date": "2016-08-29", "News": "Supported byThe fashion brand Kate Spade is most known for luxury handbags. But it is also banking on gold-accented staplers, monogrammed planners and $30 ballpoint pens to help buoy sales during the increasingly important back-to-school shopping season.The discount retailer Dollar Tree is also expecting students and their parents to lift sales, particularly after an unusually weak second quarter. But instead of fancy notebooks, it is focusing on the other end of the price spectrum, like $1 packs of tape, glue sticks and pencils.As the income gap in the United States has turned into a chasm, luxury and discount retailers have become increasingly deft at attracting people at the separate ends of the income spectrum. Stores positioned for the middle, like traditional department stores, have struggled by comparison.These days, that divide extends more than ever to what students wear and carry with them to their school lockers.\u201cBoth luxury retailers and value stores, like dollar stores, are benefiting right now from the back-to-school trend,\u201d said Jharonne Martis, a retail analyst with Thomson Reuters. \u201cThey\u2019re really benefiting from their core consumer.\u201dParents expect to spend an average of $673.57 on electronics, clothes and notebooks this year, compared with $630.36 last year, according to the National Retail Federation, an industry trade group. In total, parents of kindergarten through 12th-grade students say they will spend $27.3 billion on school supplies this year, up from $18.4 billion in 2007.The back-to-school season is the second-biggest shopping period of the year, behind Christmas. But while families will spend more than before, how they will do it \u2014 and where they will do it \u2014 varies widely.A growing list of designer notebooks, luxury desk accessories and even beanbag chairs now caters to wealthy back-to-school shoppers. Shoppers can buy a $195 Gucci headband, a $572 Versace backpack and a $28 Terez pencil case on the back-to-school section of Saks\u2019 website. Restoration Hardware has a new \u201cteen\u201d line that includes a $2,000 \u201criveted aluminum\u201d desk and $250 faux fur beanbag chairs.Ms. Martis said she expected Kate Spade\u2019s desk accessories and stationery products to be a big focus this season, projecting that sales would rise 7 percent this quarter at stores open at least a year. (The company said it could not make executives available for an interview.)But back-to-school items are also expected to buoy sales at discount retailers like T. J. Maxx, whose appeal is increasingly wide and which aim at the growing number of poor students and families in the United States.In 2007, about nine million public school students came from low-income households, according to the Department of Education\u2019s National Center for Education Statistics. In 2014, there were more than 11 million, according to the most recent data.Some of these families rely on backpack drives and other support from nonprofit or community groups. Many, though, are left seeking the best deals.One big back-to-school item this year: uniforms. Many retailers are promoting them heavily, like Target, which has promoted half-off prices on uniforms.\u201cOur people said that whether it\u2019s Burlington or Target or J. C. Penney or Sears, the uniform section was the hottest part of the competitive space for back to school,\u201d said Craig Johnson, the president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consulting group. \u201cAbout twice as many stores this year as last are doing specials on uniforms.\u201dRetailers who cater to middle-class consumers have been struggling, slashing prices in what has become an aggressive race to the bottom. Sales at traditional department stores have slumped, and once-mighty institutions like Macy\u2019s and Sears have had to close stores.Some retailers have cast a wider net. Jamie Nordstrom, the president of Nordstrom stores, a legacy department store trying to adapt to new consumer tastes, said it had found consumers to want a variety of prices. So for back-to-school, the retailer offers a mix: a $495 Burberry girls\u2019 cross-body bag, next to a $32 backpack and a set of $17 gel pens.\u201cWe don\u2019t think about it as a high-end shopper and a low-end shopper,\u201d Mr. Nordstrom said. \u201cMost people, as they\u2019re living today, they\u2019re wearing high-end and low-end at the same time.\u201dThe income gap plays out in other ways for students, too.Supply lists can vary widely \u2014 it is not uncommon to see USB flash drives, graphing calculators or pocket dictionaries in many wealthier districts. And budget cuts have forced many schools to rely more on parents for what would once have been considered essentials: things like construction paper, tissues or pencils.\u201cThey want like four boxes of crayons, 48 pencils,\u201d said Natalie Pumphrey, a 33-year-old single mother of five from San Antonio, Tex. \u201cI\u2019m having trouble buying school supplies for my own children, and I feel like I\u2019m buying for the whole class.\u201dFactor in extracurricular activities and the difference between the money spent by high- and low-income students is even starker, said Brent Wilder, the corporate public relations director for Huntington National Bank. The company has analyzed back-to-school supply lists from about 30 schools in Ohio and surrounding states every year for the last decade.This year, Huntington estimates that the families of elementary-school-age students will be expected to pay for an average of $659 worth of supplies and fees, while high school students will need $1,498. That is up from $351 and $894 in 2007, the first year the bank began doing the survey.The expenses can go much higher, though. \u201cI\u2019ve seen districts that have $1,500 band fees,\u201d Mr. Wilder said.But the point of the survey, he says, is to make sure people \u2014 especially at the lower-income levels \u2014 know what they will be facing.\u201cWe really wanted to highlight to consumers in our markets that this was an expense that they needed to plan for,\u201d Mr. Wilder said. \u201cThey literally cannot afford to buy classroom supplies and pay all of their bills if they don\u2019t plan ahead.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Airbnb for Business Travelers: More Wi-Fi, Fewer Hosts in Towels", "Date": "2016-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byItinerariesWhether traveling for business or pleasure, Tad Milbourn, chief executive of the San Francisco technology start-up Payable, stays at an Airbnb property whenever possible.\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely the coolest, being in someone\u2019s house as opposed to a hotel,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s superior, from the price, experience and novelty standpoint.\u201dBecause Payable helps clients manage payments, Mr. Milbourn is particularly attuned to the services Airbnb has developed for business travelers, and he encourages his two employees who travel to use Airbnb and its services too. These include the ability to track employees\u2019 whereabouts and spending and to charge expenses to a corporate credit card.Mr. Milbourn is one of many business travelers now choosing Airbnb or other home-sharing services, like HomeAway and VRBO, over conventional hotels.A report issued last month by Concur, a travel and expense management company, found that the number of nights that its 42 million business travel customers spent in home-sharing accommodations rose more than 50 percent from the first quarter of 2015 to the first quarter of this year.Airbnb is actively cultivating this clientele, having recently reached agreements with three big business travel management companies in the United States: American Express Global Business Travel, BCD Travel and Carlson Wagonlit Travel.Under these agreements, Airbnb will send data on travelers\u2019 expenditures and itineraries to the travel management companies, which in turn will share the information with the travelers\u2019 employers, their clients. The employers can then use this data to monitor employees\u2019 spending and travel and to track them down, as needed, if there is an emergency.But some business travelers who have used Airbnb, especially those whose bosses booked the accommodations for them, warn that bad surprises can sometimes await.Alexa Pothier, a Boston-based consultant for a Palo Alto, Calif., software company, who has used Airbnb occasionally during vacations with generally positive results, had a different outcome on a business trip in 2014 when she stayed at a one-bedroom apartment in the Shoreditch neighborhood of London.The host owned a small business in a storefront on the ground floor, which Ms. Pothier had to walk through to reach the stairs to the apartment. Although the apartment had a large living space, where Ms. Pothier said she could work comfortably, she was startled by a mouse that \u201cearly on scampered very quickly across the couch.\u201dAnd the bedroom window overlooked a noisy street, which forced her to use earplugs that the host had left in a bowl next to the bed.When Katie Gilligan, a New Yorker and a former account manager for a London-based ticket-booking service, traveled to London last year on business, her boss put her up for a week each at two apartments booked through Airbnb.The second apartment, in the King\u2019s Cross neighborhood, was owned by a woman who shared the living space and would not let Ms. Gilligan use the water or flush the toilet after 8 p.m. The host also walked around wearing only a towel, Ms. Gilligan said, \u201ctalking to me about her life experience and about aliens coming down and probing people.\u201dAll the more reason, perhaps, to use Airbnb\u2019s business travel services that include \u201cbusiness travel ready\u201d listings \u2014 accommodations geared toward business travelers\u2019 specific needs.To qualify, a lodging must meet various criteria, including high customer ratings; 24-hour check-in; accommodations that are an entire home or apartment, not shared with the owner; the availability of Wi-Fi and a laptop-friendly work space; and an iron, a hair dryer and other amenities.Chip Conley, head of global hospitality and strategy for Airbnb, said that more than 70,000 companies had made bookings through Airbnb for Business, a program introduced last year that features listings and travel management tools.Not all of those companies, however, are as willing as Payable to talk about their use of Airbnb.Some of the prominent companies that Mr. Conley and others at Airbnb have cited as business travel customers \u2014 including Facebook and Google \u2014 declined to discuss the topic for this article. And many of the companies that were willing, including Morgan Stanley, Salesforce, Twilio and TBWA, had other business relationships with Airbnb.Some professionals in the business travel industry acknowledge the potential benefits of using services like Airbnb, and see some of the drawbacks.Airbnb\u2019s affordable offerings could help budget-conscious attendees of conventions and meetings, Deborah Sexton, president and chief executive of the Professional Convention Management Association, said in an email. Home-sharing accommodations can also offer an attractive alternative when hotel rooms are sold out, she said.Depending on its location, an Airbnb property might not be the most convenient option for a business traveler, particularly someone attending a conference or convention, Ms. Sexton said.\u201cOne of the biggest perks of a host hotel is its central location,\u201d she said. \u201cFor attendees who stay at Airbnb properties in different neighborhoods, getting to an early-morning conference or attending a late-night evening reception may be more difficult.\u201dMs. Sexton and some other experts also raised safety and legal concerns.Although Airbnb offers host protection insurance, which provides primary coverage for Airbnb hosts and landlords in more than 15 countries against liability claims of up to $1 million, the coverage does not apply to liability from assault and battery, sexual abuse or molestation, or to acts of terrorism, among other events.William A. Brewer III, a lawyer in New York and Dallas who represents hotel owners \u2014 typically some of Airbnb\u2019s staunchest opponents \u2014 said hotel owners, managers and franchisers had an obligation to reduce foreseeable risks. For the traveler, he said, the question is whether the providers of lodging have a balance sheet strong enough to pay for their negligence if trouble occurs.\u201cI believe this is why businesses often place their faith in well-known hotel chains when booking employee travel,\u201d he added.But those concerns might be offset, Mr. Brewer said, if a traveler were on a long-term assignment and the employer could cut costs significantly by booking an Airbnb property. In this case, he said, the employer could find it worthwhile to \u201cexpend the amount of effort required for due diligence to offset any liability issues.\u201dAirbnb has sued San Francisco over a June decision by the city\u2019s Board of Supervisors to fine the company $1,000 a day for every unregistered host on its service.That followed a bipartisan move by New York lawmakers, who voted to heavily fine anyone who used Airbnb to rent an entire apartment for fewer than 30 days \u2014 a practice that has been illegal in the state since 2010.Nick Papas, an Airbnb spokesman, said the company would not let those disputes deter its efforts to cultivate a business traveler clientele. \u201cThus far, we\u2019ve seen that business and leisure travelers remain eager to use Airbnb in New York and San Francisco,\u201d he said.Bjorn Hanson, a professor at the Tisch Center for Hospitality and Tourism at New York University, said the travel management companies\u2019 agreements with Airbnb showed that they were \u201ceffectively endorsing\u201d Airbnb.\u201cThis changes the debate\u201d that Airbnb is having with New York and San Francisco, he said, and gives \u201cmuch more weight to Airbnb\u2019s side.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rape, Race and the Jogger", "Date": "2016-08-25", "News": "Supported byOpinionWhen I ran cross-country in high school in California, I was well trained, well coached and professionally sized for my Asics racing flats. Running was a source of pleasurable vulnerability: I courted the limits of how much self-inflicted pain my body could handle, tracing the long curve of Santa Monica Bay, on the hard sand by the water, and the wealthy streets of Brentwood, past hedge-hidden homes. My runs were backlit by privilege.When I lived in Nicaragua in my early 20s, I was aware of myself as something of a spectacle when I went jogging. I lived in a town where most people supported themselves with physical labor, and they did not choose to spend the leisure time they rarely had running miles through the humid heat. The inclination toward voluntary physical exertion is one of jogging\u2019s many prerequisites: You need free time, decent shoes, possibly child care. Studies have routinely shown that those with money are much more likely to run for fun.In the last month, three female joggers \u2014 all of them white, all around 30 \u2014 have been murdered: Alexandra Brueger, a nurse in Michigan; Karina Vetrano, who worked at a restaurant in Howard Beach, Queens; and Vanessa Marcotte, a Google employee who was attacked while jogging on a bucolic stretch of wooded road near her mother\u2019s home in Massachusetts.Their deaths are horrifying, their families\u2019 grief unimaginable, and they make me aware of my own vulnerability \u2014 as a jogger, I guess, but mainly as a woman and a human being with an innately fragile body. Their deaths also make me aware of the fact that I have a body \u2014 female, white, 33 \u2014 readily understood as vulnerable. They come at the end of a summer marked by other killings \u2014 Alton Sterling, Philando Castile, Sylville Smith, all black men, all shot by police officers who imagined they were threats \u2014 that make me aware of the ways in which my body isn\u2019t vulnerable at all. I have been pulled over for traffic violations plenty of times, but I have never been shot while reaching for my license.It\u2019s impossible to talk about the figure of the vulnerable jogger in the American imagination without returning to the Central Park Jogger: an investment banker named Trisha Meili, 28 years old and white, who was raped and brutally beaten \u2014 allegedly by a \u201cwolf pack\u201d of black and Hispanic teenagers \u2014 in Central Park on April 19, 1989. During most of the media frenzy, Ms. Meili was simply known as \u201cthe jogger\u201d: \u201cTeen Gang Rapes Jogger\u201d; \u201cFemale Jogger Near Death.\u201dMs. Meili was called \u201cthe jogger\u201d to protect her anonymity, but the relentless recurrence of the title also affirmed the narrative the media had spun around her, which presented a character defined by youth and health, by ambition and upward mobility, by her desire to claim Central Park as a space of leisure \u2014 despite assertions that it wasn\u2019t safe after dark, especially above 96th Street \u2014 and by her refusal to capitulate to fear, by her determination to jog anyway. \u201cThe jogger\u201d had been exercising a kind of willpower people admired, but her willpower had been viciously punished, and people were hungry for more punishment in return.The boys accused of assaulting Ms. Meili \u2014 Kharey Wise, Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam and Raymond Santana, Jr. \u2014 were convicted on the strength of contradictory confessions coerced under duress. After an incarcerated serial rapist named Matias Reyes eventually confessed to the crime more than a decade later, a claim confirmed by DNA evidence, their convictions were vacated in 2002.In the early pages of her 2003 memoir, \u201cI Am the Central Park Jogger,\u201d a moving account of her recovery, Ms. Meili resists the standard first-person and refers to herself as \u201cthe jogger\u201d instead: \u201cIt is astonishing that the Jogger is alive,\u201d she writes about her own body, found in the woods north of the 102nd Street transverse, where she was hypothermic and barely breathing, gagged with a white shirt soaked red. She had lost 75 percent of her blood.Her third-person narrative is an elegant testimony to the fact that she still has no access to her own interior experience at that time \u2014 no memories of the night of the attack, nor the six weeks that followed it. She cannot remember being \u201cI\u201d in those moments. It\u2019s almost as if she is telling her story through the lens of the public\u2019s obsession with it: \u201cThe rape of a slim, seemingly frail, innocent woman,\u201d she writes, \u201cseems a rape of the city itself.\u201d She acknowledges the ways her vulnerability was part of her public image (\u201cfrail\u201d) but also resists understanding herself wholly in terms of this frailty (\u201cseemingly\u201d).The lead prosecutor in her case was a jogger as well: Elizabeth Lederer, a white woman in her 30s who ran the same Central Park trails as Ms. Meili. In her cross-examination of Mr. Salaam, trying to dispute his claim that he\u2019d gone into the park that night to \u201cwalk around,\u201d Ms. Lederer asked: \u201cDid you have jogging clothes on?\u201d She said: \u201cYou weren\u2019t going there for a picnic, were you?\u201dMs. Meili describes the fantasies of invulnerability that brought her to the park to run: \u201cI was indestructible, omnipotent. Comfortable. I could run and run and nothing and no one could harm me.\u201dThe Central Park Five had their own fantasies of invulnerability: They believed that because they were innocent, they wouldn\u2019t go to jail. They thought if they said what the police wanted them to say, they would go home. But instead they went to prison \u2014 where their own bodies, already vulnerable, became even more so. Kharey Wise was beaten up in the TV room at Rikers Island. Even after he was released, Raymond Santana still showered with his boxers on.*What is it about the imperiled silhouette of the young female jogger that grips the collective imagination with such force? I think it has something to do with the wholesomeness of jogging \u2014 the way it suggests capability, self-improvement, female autonomy \u2014 and the horror of witnessing its virtues violated.This has been a summer of vulnerable and brutalized bodies, a summer of unjust violence once again carried out in the guise of justice, a summer of fear and fear mongering. Our Republican presidential nominee is the same man who put out a full-page newspaper ad in 1989 calling for the reinstatement of the death penalty in the aftermath of the Central Park Jogger\u2019s attack. \u201cI want them to understand our anger,\u201d he wrote, about the boys whose guilt he assumed. \u201cI want them to be afraid.\u201dThey were afraid, and their mothers were afraid, and each one of them came of age behind bars, for a crime he didn\u2019t commit.In the documentary \u201cThe Central Park Five,\u201d Angela Cuffee, the sister of the defendant Kevin Richardson, says: \u201cPatricia Meili, my brother, all the boys, all of our families \u2014 all of us are victims.\u201d She doesn\u2019t conflate the experiences of the jogger and the boys persecuted in her name, but she does ask us to recognize their violations as part of the same story: We responded to unjust violence by demanding more of it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Tech Firms Forced to Choose Market: Home or Everywhere Else", "Date": "2016-08-09", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 For teenagers who like to sing along with Ariana Grande and Flo Rida, Musical.ly is a must-have. The app that lets users lip-sync and dance in their own music videos boasts 100 million users and partners with pop stars like Ms. Grande and Meghan Trainor.It\u2019s not easy to tell Musical.ly is Chinese \u2014 and that\u2019s deliberate. To find success in America, its parent company has ignored China, its home market and a country with 700 million internet users.The reason is simple, says Alex Zhu, co-founder of Shanghai-based Musical.ly: China\u2019s internet is fundamentally different from the one used in much of the rest of the world.\u201cIt\u2019s still very difficult to get into China,\u201d said Mr. Zhu, who studied civil engineering at Zhejiang University in the eastern city of Hangzhou. \u201cIt\u2019s a closed environment, and you have to be quite different to compete in that market.\u201dFor China\u2019s web companies, the divide may have even more significant implications.It has penned in the country\u2019s biggest and most innovative internet companies. Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent have grown to be some of the world\u2019s largest internet companies, but they rely almost entirely on domestic businesses. Their ventures abroad have been mostly desultory, and prognostications that they will challenge American giants internationally have not materialized.For Chinese web start-ups like Musical.ly, the internet split has also forced them to choose \u2014 either create something that caters to China\u2019s digital population or focus on the rest of the globe.In many ways, the split is like 19th century railroads in the United States, when rails of different sizes hindered a train\u2019s ability to go from one place to another.\u201cThe barrier to entering the U.S. or China market is becoming higher and higher,\u201d said Kai-fu Lee, a venture investor from Taiwan and former head of Google China.In 2012, armed with a cash stockpile of several hundred million dollars, the world soccer star Lionel Messi as a spokesman and local ads like Bollywood-inspired commercials in India, Tencent began a push that executives said would be its best chance of breaking out of China. The effort flopped.Critics pointed to Tencent\u2019s lack of distinctive marketing, a record of censorship and surveillance in China and its late arrival to foreign markets. Yet the biggest problem was that outside of China, WeChat was just not the same. Within China, WeChat can be used to do almost everything, like pay bills, hail a taxi, book a doctor\u2019s appointment, share photos and chat. Yet its ability to do that is dependent on other Chinese internet services that are limited outside the country.That leaves WeChat outside China as an app that people mostly use to chat and share photos \u2014 not that different from WhatsApp and Messenger, which are both owned by Facebook. Baidu and Alibaba have apps that similarly offer a range of capabilities, yet are less useful outside China.The same problem hurts start-ups in China. Those companies start out accustomed to using Chinese internet sites and apps to market and enhance their business. But going abroad means a different world of services to master, such as a solid understanding of Facebook and Google\u2019s platforms and ads, not Baidu\u2019s and Tencent\u2019s.By contrast, Musical.ly chose the opposite approach and linked itself to the most popular social networks in the United States. If someone records an impressively coordinated dance or flawlessly lip-synced song, the person can put it up not just on the app, but also add it to Instagram, send it on WhatsApp or post it to Facebook. That has helped Musical.ly grow naturally to Europe, South America and Southeast Asia, Mr. Zhu said.\u201cThe thing about this young generation in the U.S. is, they\u2019re creative,\u201d said Mr. Zhu. \u201cThey\u2019ll say, \u2018Please follow me on Instagram or Snapchat.\u2019 If your app can attract some people in an age group and make them super excited to share, you will probably grow.\u201dFor Cheetah Mobile, a maker of smartphone utility apps based in Beijing whose users are mostly outside China, the solution was finding a steppingstone to the rest of the world. In early 2014, it opened an office in Taiwan, where use of Google and Facebook dominates. That helped it gain employees who intimately understood Facebook, YouTube and other major Western platforms that could be used for advertising.\u201cTaiwan served as a bridge for us across the Pacific to the United States,\u201d said Charles Fan, Cheetah\u2019s chief technology officer.Tencent, Alibaba and Baidu have all opened American offices, but they have mostly turned to investments and acquisitions to gain footholds overseas. Over the last two years, Alibaba has invested in emerging markets, including two online commerce companies, Paytm and Snapdeal, in India. It also spent $1 billion to acquire Lazada, an e-commerce site popular in Southeast Asia.Perhaps the greatest indication of Tencent\u2019s overseas ambitions was a deal that never happened. In 2014, with its global WeChat campaign faltering, it was preparing to start negotiations to bid for WhatsApp when Facebook swooped in, according to a senior Tencent executive who asked for anonymity in discussing corporate strategy.Tencent and Baidu declined to comment. An Alibaba spokeswoman referred to recent remarks by Alibaba\u2019s president, J. Michael Evans, in which he pointed to acquisitions as a way the company was attracting new consumers in developing markets. He also said Alibaba was focused on attracting more foreign businesses to sell on its markets in China.Mr. Lee said it might take a new technological jump for Chinese companies to get a chance at building a platform inside China and internationally. He said Chinese companies could prove competitive in emerging sectors like virtual reality, artificial intelligence and robotics.\u201cI think what might be surprising is, China will catch up rapidly,\u201d he said. \u201cPartly because of Chinese universities, partly because of returnees to China who form a portion of the top engineers in the world.\u201dMusical.ly is in many ways a product of the cultural exchange between the United States and China that Mr. Lee described. Mr. Zhu, 37, graduated from a Chinese university, but moved to the United States with the German software company SAP in 2010. He had the idea for the music app while riding the train from San Francisco to Mountain View, Calif., in a car full of high school students.\u201cHalf were listening to music and the other half were using their phone to take photos and add emojis, and they were passing them around,\u201d Mr. Zhu said. Then it hit him: combine the selfie and social media part with the music part and turn it into one product. In 2015, Mr. Zhu moved to Shanghai, where his co-founder has been based since Musical.ly\u2019s 2013 inception.Yet Musical.ly is unlikely to be the social network to link both sides of the Pacific. For the demographic the app is focusing on, it\u2019s far better to be outside its home market, Mr. Zhu said.\u201cTeenagers in the U.S. are a golden audience,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at China, the teenage culture doesn\u2019t exist \u2014 the teens are super busy in school studying for tests, so they don\u2019t have the time and luxury to play social media apps.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lyft Is Said to Seek a Buyer, Without Success", "Date": "2016-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt is not an easy thing to be an independent ride-hailing company these days.For one, it takes billions of dollars and hundreds of employees to spread to new cities, to market the service and to recruit drivers. Legislators and local laws are often not in your favor. And competitors with deep pockets from all over the world are waiting to cheer if you happen to fail.Lyft, the second-biggest ride-hailing company in the United States behind Uber, is grappling with those forces \u2014 but has found that its options are limited.The company, which is based in San Francisco, has in recent months held talks or made approaches to sell itself to companies including General Motors, Apple, Google, Amazon, Uber and Didi Chuxing, according to a dozen people who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. One person said it was Lyft who was approached by interested parties.Lyft\u2019s discussions were most serious with G.M., which is one of the ride-hailing company\u2019s largest investors. Still, G.M. never made a written offer to buy Lyft, said the people, and in the end, Lyft did not find a buyer.Lyft is not in danger of closing down and has a cash cushion of $1.4 billion, some of these people added, so the company will continue as an independent entity.Still, the talks underline how difficult it has become to operate in the ride-hailing market, where people can book rides from drivers through a smartphone app. While ride-hailing companies do not own fleets of cars and instead rely on drivers who have their own vehicles, the business is highly capital-intensive. Venture capitalists and other investors have poured billions of dollars into the companies.Lyft, a four-year-old company founded by Logan Green and John Zimmer, sprang out of an early long-distance car-pooling program, then called Zimride, in 2007. The goal, the two co-founders have said, was to create a new kind of social ride-sharing, an attempt to decrease the number of cars on the road and to improve congestion, reduce humanity\u2019s environmental footprint and create more efficiency in transportation.That idea has turned into a global movement, as companies worldwide \u2014 like Grab in Southeast Asia, Ola in India, BlaBlaCar in Europe and Uber \u2014 look to upend the global transportation infrastructure.The effort to sell Lyft was aided by bankers at Qatalyst Partners, the boutique investment bank founded by the veteran Silicon Valley banker Frank Quattrone, said the people with knowledge of the talks. Qatalyst declined to comment.Lyft also struggled to find a buyer because of the challenging economics of the ride-hailing business. Companies like Lyft and Uber typically take 20 percent to 25 percent of the cost of each ride. With Lyft drivers expected to pick up an estimated $2 billion or so in fares this year, that meant Lyft\u2019s annual revenue would be about $400 million, according to a person familiar with the company\u2019s financials.That $400 million shrinks after marketing costs are factored in. To win loyalty from drivers who can also work for Uber, Lyft also sometimes lets drivers keep that 20 percent to 25 percent of some rides, so the company effectively earns no revenue in those situations. And in some cases, Lyft provides drivers with additional cash incentives simply to get out on the road, adding to its costs.\u201cOne of the challenges for these companies is to figure out how to grow and sustain that latent demand for these businesses, but also to eventually become profitable,\u201d said Susan Shaheen, co-director of the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cPart of the challenge in evolving those services is just balancing out those factors. And that\u2019s not an easy task.\u201dLyft is not profitable, said a person briefed on the company\u2019s finances. Yet it has a $1.4 billion cash hoard, the person added, and the company thinks that will shield it as it works toward achieving profitability.Ms. Shaheen said an acquisition might still make sense for ride-hailing companies that needed more resources and a bigger size to compete.\u201cThere isn\u2019t a single company that has all of this expertise \u2014 software, manufacturing, ride-sharing \u2014 under one roof,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s where acquisition comes in.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Poets Can Make Better Search Engines", "Date": "2016-08-09", "News": "Supported byDaniel Nadler spends most of his waking hours running the technology start-up Kensho, which has become a darling of the financial industry, attracting big investments from Goldman Sachs and venture capitalists.But in the mornings and on weekends, Mr. Nadler, 33, writes poetry \u2014 an art he studied while at Harvard, where he was a student of the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Jorie Graham. Mr. Nadler\u2019s first collection, \u201cLacunae: 100 Imagined Ancient Love Poems,\u201d is being published this week by Farrar Straus and Giroux.Mr. Nadler may work with technology, but his book imagines a world before computers and telephones. The unnamed narrators of these love poems live in an unidentified place in a distant mythic past. Jonathan Galassi, Mr. Nadler\u2019s editor at Farrar Straus, said he was drawn to the pared-down, direct nature of the work: \u201cNot many poets today are bold enough to be this simple.\u201dMr. Nadler has developed some rather austere practices for separating his poetry from his job as an entrepreneur. When he is writing he doesn\u2019t check his email, speak or even look in a mirror.But he also says that his work at Kensho \u2014 on what is essentially a search engine for economic events and data \u2014 is deeply informed by his experience as a poet, and vice versa.We talked to Mr. Nadler about his habits, his day job and why poets can make better search engines. Below are edited excerpts from the conversation.When do you write your poetry?I write in the morning.I make a habit of not looking at email and try to make it so I have a period of time in which whatever is going on in the world hasn\u2019t arrived at the threshold of my consciousness yet.Why?Poetry is inseparable from the idea of a voice \u2014 from singing. To isolate what in your voice could be used to sing, or to even speak an utterance that is poetic, you need to have some buffer between the use of your voice as a utilitarian instrument and the use of your voice as a human instrument.I heard that you also avoid looking in mirrors.I never look in a mirror until I am finished writing for the day.My own reflection in a mirror reminds me that I am an organism situated in time, one that once was not here, one that will at some point not be here.That seems like it could be particularly useful in these poems, in which you imagine yourself into a different time.I am writing poetry in which a human being is the character and where what\u2019s common about our humanity is the aspect of the character I am trying to explore. In order to do that, I need to get as far away from what is idiosyncratic about me as a human being as possible.Can you explain the concept behind this volume of poetry?In my mind, I created this idea of ancient poems that in reality have never been written. My project is the same project that I believe Pablo Neruda was pursuing, which was a direct encounter with nature, unburdened by the history of allusion and the history of symbolism, and the history of footnotes.What is the world these characters live in?A world without technology \u2014 a world without the internet \u2014 in a world without complex political and economic structures. In such a time, the most conspicuous thing on the horizon is love.The exploration of that world was the path through which to get back to the basic elemental truths about love and human relationships.It seems a bit odd for a technologist to be writing about a time before technology, no?Artificial intelligence and machine intelligence are about decreasing the length of human perception. Google autocomplete is an attempt to shorten the time and path between thought and a response \u2014 to decrease the time and path between seeing something and categorizing it or identifying it and moving on.To me what poetry in particular is so good at is defamiliarization. Increasing the length of perception. Allowing grown adults to return to the childlike state in which routine experiences, or ordinary objects seem totally strange or foreign.To me that is the role that art in general and poetry specifically must play in the 21st century. As a counterweight to the many things pushing to decrease the length of perception.How do you achieve that yourself?As long as I can remember, I had this odd, almost what I call neurological pathology, where I experienced the parts of things before the whole. I almost went through the world as in an early Picasso or Braque painting with things decomposed, and it would take me a while to see the whole object and it would only come after seeing the parts.I try as hard as I can to retain that wonderful ability. I want to increase the length of perception and recover the sensation of the first perception of a thing. Those are the things I am working at, as a poet and as a human.Why choose poetry as your art form? My generation has grown up through video games and immersive worlds. In a video game your character can see a rock and then just sort of walk around the rock. That\u2019s a very different modality than a movie, which is a totally directed experience.Poetry is the most directly analogous high art form to environments like video games and virtual reality. Poetry is entirely about regulating the pace of your own emotional transportation, and it is the one that is going to be the most native to millennials who have grown up with that idea.Does your poetry complement your day job or distract from it?They are wonderfully synergistic, which is why I never feel myself needing to divide my time.Poetry teaches you how to build a better search engine because it teaches you how to reflect on the needed balance between expectation, utility and serendipity.If a search engine only provides exactly what you are looking for, then it is only as smart or as dumb as you are. We all know from using search engines that a pleasure of life is serendipitous discovery. It\u2019s one of the reasons we like using Wikipedia. As a design principle, that\u2019s a way to build a better search engine.An earlier version of this article misstated the time during which Mr. Nadler studied poetry with Jorie Graham. It was while he was studying for a Ph.D., not during his time as an undergraduate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With N.F.L. Deal, Twitter Live-Streams Its Ambitions", "Date": "2016-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Last March, Twitter and Facebook, along with other tech companies, faced off over which of them would get the rights to live-stream National Football League games on Thursday nights.Twitter, in contrast, agreed to pay the N.F.L. around $10 million to stream 10 games and to sell only a portion of the ad inventory exclusively. Twitter, which is based in San Francisco, wanted the Thursday night games because of their popularity; each game drew an average of 13 million viewers last season.When Twitter streams its first N.F.L. game on Sept. 15, it will get to assess whether its vigorous pursuit will pay off \u2014 and whether live streaming can viably be a linchpin of its future.Since April, Twitter has signed a series of live-streaming deals, including with Wimbledon, CBS News, the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League and Pac-12 Networks. Twitter is also in discussions with other organizations, including Major League Soccer and the Professional Golfers Association, for similar agreements, according to people briefed on the talks.Facebook declined to comment on the N.F.L. talks. In a statement at the time, the N.F.L. commissioner, Roger Goodell, said Twitter \u201cis where live events unfold and is the right partner.\u201d Major League Soccer declined to comment on discussions with Twitter, and the P.G.A. did not respond to requests for comment.For Twitter, the bet on live streaming is crucial to turning itself into a mainstream internet destination after other efforts have failed. Live streaming could finally broaden Twitter\u2019s appeal, attracting an even wider audience. And perhaps more important, live events would be another way to sell video ads. If streaming football or basketball games on Twitter\u2019s mobile apps and on desktop computers, along with other platforms, draws viewers, the company could sell more video ads, which typically command a premium.Twitter has directed Mr. Noto, a former Goldman Sachs banker with deep ties to the sports media industry, to lead the charge on live streaming and has assigned an engineering team to create its streaming video player. Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, considers streaming a critical component of the company\u2019s focus on \u201clive\u201d experiences, along with Periscope, its app that allows smartphone users to live-stream video.To bolster the effort, Twitter is in talks with Apple to bring the Twitter app to Apple TV, which would potentially let millions of Apple TV users watch the streaming N.F.L. games, according to the two people briefed on the discussions.Apple and Twitter declined to comment.Yet even as Twitter increases its live-streaming efforts, so are many of its rivals. Snapchat and Facebook are working on deals with media companies to acquire live-streaming rights to sporting events and entertainment; Instagram is also experimenting with live products. All of the companies are fiercely competing for video advertising dollars, as marketers slowly begin to shift money to online video promotions and away from television ads.There are other hurdles to live streaming, especially from wary content providers who view the technology world with a dose of suspicion.Twitter\u2019s push on live streaming began in late 2014 when Dick Costolo, then the company\u2019s chief executive, called Mr. Noto to discuss how to better use content \u2014 video, text or photos \u2014 to bring people to its service. Over the next 18 months, senior executives at the company debated options. Some batted around the idea of buying Mic, a news website aimed at young audiences, according to a person briefed on the conversations. Others were bullish on video.Eventually, video won out. Mr. Noto said that introducing premium content like sports, politics and entertainment \u2014 the types of programming people often pay to see \u2014 would entice and retain more Twitter users.Even with competition from Snapchat and Facebook, Twitter has a foundation to attract more live-streaming deals. For years, Twitter forged relationships with networks and content owners through a program known as Amplify, in which Twitter worked with TV programmers to distribute short video clips that were preceded by ads sold by both Twitter and the content owners.Twitter is also emphasizing its younger audience as a reason for marketers to advertise on live events. About 72 percent of the social media service\u2019s user base is 18 to 34 years old, according to third-party data and company models, said two people who asked for anonymity because Twitter\u2019s internal metrics were confidential.That focus has in part enabled Twitter to land advertisers like Bank of America for the streaming N.F.L. games.\u201cTwitter really owns those moments that matter to everyone,\u201d said Lou Paskalis, senior vice president for enterprise media planning at Bank of America. \u201cAs a marketer, what we can do with the context that Twitter creates is to join that shared moment.\u201dMr. Noto cautioned that Twitter\u2019s live-streaming strategy was still not fully formed and was just one part of a multipronged plan to remake the company. If live streaming works out, the plan is to make the live videos more easily accessible on Twitter \u2014 whether through notifications in the main timeline or through a mobile tab in Twitter\u2019s app called Moments, said two people briefed on the company\u2019s product plans.But first comes the N.F.L. game next month between the New York Jets and the Buffalo Bills, which will be live-streamed from Buffalo.\u201cOur opportunity is to use these familiar platforms that people understand, like streaming video, as a window into seeing everything else we really have available,\u201d Mr. Noto said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Colson Whitehead on Slavery, Success and Writing the Novel That Really Scared Him", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "Supported byColson Whitehead has long had a thing for the metaphoric possibilities of mechanized modes of transport, the more old-fashioned the better.But in his new novel, Mr. Whitehead grabs onto the most richly metaphoric conveyance of all: the Underground Railroad.Mr. Whitehead, 46, may be used to great reviews and enviable prizes, like the MacArthur Fellowship, the so-called genius grant, which he received in 2002. But a few days before Ms. Winfrey\u2019s announcement, he seemed a bit dazed by his impending ride into a bigger spotlight.\u201cI\u2019m having a hard time wrapping my head around how people are responding to the book,\u201d he said during an interview in his home office in Greenwich Village. \u201cI\u2019m someone who just likes being in my cave and thinking up weird stuff.\u201d\u201cThe Underground Railroad\u201d \u2014 published by Doubleday, with a first print run of 200,000 copies \u2014 is written in a more straightforwardly realist mode than many of Mr. Whitehead\u2019s books, which have tended toward high-concept premises, extended set pieces and jokey riffs. It begins with a harrowing depiction of life on a Georgia plantation around 1850, before taking off on a suspenseful journey through several different states with social systems that mash up racial terrors from decades far into the future.There is Whiteheadian weirdness \u2014 hints of strange eugenics experiments; Friday night lynchings staged like vaudeville shows; and a kitschy \u201cliving history\u201d museum, where Cora re-enacts a sugarcoated version of plantation life \u2014 but it creeps in slowly, with a subtlety that may send some readers to Google to check their memories of high school history.\u201cI went back and reread \u2018100 Years of Solitude,\u2019 and it made me think about what it would be like if I didn\u2019t turn the dial up to 10, but kept the fantasy much more matter-of-fact,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted it to be like the slave narratives I read, where you get a very matter-of-fact contemplation of all these weird and horrible things that keep happening.\u201dThe idea for the book came to Mr. Whitehead around 2000, when he had just finished \u201cJohn Henry Days.\u201d\u201cI had the thought, \u2018What if the Underground Railroad were a real train?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI sat on the couch, thinking about it, but it seemed like it would require a lot of real research, and I just wasn\u2019t up to it.\u201dIn the poker book, Mr. Whitehead, who had recently gone through a divorce, styled himself as a hyperactively wisecracking depressive who had a good poker face because, as he put it in the first line, \u201cI am half dead inside.\u201d In person, he comes off as friendly but guarded, and wary of the expectations put on an African-American writer who publishes a big book about race and freedom in the era of Black Lives Matter.He mentioned a bookstore owner from the South who invited him to come down for \u201ca frank talk about race.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m honored by the response to the novel, but I was like, \u2018Can we just talk about the book?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not a representative of blackness, and I\u2019m not a healer.\u201dStill, he describes \u201cThe Underground Railroad,\u201d which he began in earnest in the spring of 2014, as responding to a kind of inner pull. He was about to start another book with another \u201cexistential black dude narrator,\u201d as he put it, but the Underground Railroad idea kept coming to mind.\u201cI thought, why not write the book that really scares you?\u201d he said.After he\u2019d written 100 or so pages of the novel, he let himself watch the movie \u201c12 Years a Slave,\u201d but turned it off in the middle. \u201cSeeing the movie really devastated me,\u201d he said. \u201cI could read about slave atrocities for days and days, but watching actors go through it was almost too much. I felt really messed up about what I was writing.\u201dMr. Whitehead, who is married to Julie Barer, a literary agent, grew up in Manhattan, where his parents ran an executive recruiting firm. He went to mostly white private schools, but spent summers in an African-American beach enclave in Sag Harbor, N.Y. (the inspiration for the novel), where his maternal grandfather, who owned a chain of funeral homes in New Jersey, built a house from materials he hauled out each weekend in his car.Mr. Whitehead said he knew little about his own ancestors\u2019 experiences in slavery. His mother\u2019s family, he said, had included free black tavern owners in Virginia. His father\u2019s family was in Florida by the early 20th century, but how it got there was largely lost \u201cin the mists of time.\u201dHaving children of his own \u2014 his daughter is 11, his son almost 3 \u2014 made slavery more viscerally, and sometimes terrifyingly, real.\u201cThinking about the loss of a child, about how my own children would feel if they saw me beaten to death in front of them, made writing this book very different than it would have been if I had tried it when I was 30,\u201d he said.In \u201cThe Underground Railroad,\u201d he talks about racial progress, and its limits, in a more direct, even prophetic way. Near the end, a character is seen heading for St. Louis \u2014 or, perhaps, Ferguson, Mo., present-minded readers might find themselves thinking.Mr. Whitehead said he saw his closing pages as optimistic, but also realistic.\u201cI find the last pages very hopeful,\u201d he said. \u201cBut still, wherever we go, we\u2019re still in America, which is an imperfect place. That\u2019s the reality of things.\u201dAn excerpt from \u201cThe Underground Railroad\u201d will be published as a special broadsheet section in print on Sunday, Aug. 7; there will be no digital version.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I Lost My Job and My Husband. Then I Found Newfoundland.", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "Supported bySummertimeDuring my summer break from the M.F.A. program at Columbia University in New York, I found myself amid my first adult crisis. I had been teaching writing at a summer camp for high schoolers, but when it was over, I was unemployed for the first time since I was 16. My husband had gone to an extended business training session in Texas, and while away had discovered a penchant for sleeping with men. I moved out \u2014 first to a shared room in Washington Heights with two mattresses on the floor, where I slept opposite a Russian woman who stayed up staring at me through the dark, then to a sweltering fifth-floor walk-up in East Harlem, an improvement by all accounts, but still dark, moldy and depressing. Broke, heartbroken and profoundly sweaty, I had taken to pacing the apartment sans pants in a diagonal across the sloping faux-parquet floor. When that didn\u2019t work I returned, as I always had, to books.I brought the book back across Morningside Park and allowed myself to steep in it the way I hadn\u2019t really had a chance to since beginning graduate school. Quoyle\u2019s Newfoundland was a balm for my wounds: in each chapter a glimpse beyond the New York heat and the search for another job and a divorce lawyer. Quoyle had made a clean escape from his past; Quoyle lived in a house near the ocean; in Newfoundland there was always a breeze. Newfoundland, a name with the promise of a fresh start built into its very syllables.I\u2019m not sure, exactly, how Newfoundland went from novel setting and daydream to a plan that propelled me to the Port Authority. Having family in Croatia and South Jersey, I spent most of my summers either along the Adriatic coast or down by the Jersey Shore; though neither were without their benefits or even adventures, both were exclusively family affairs, large gatherings of relatives in which I could drift and feel safe. But fate had aligned in such a way that even my risk-averse and very sad self was willing to take a chance. Alan was already in Canada, in Montreal visiting friends. I could meet him there, and we could rent a car. We could go somewhere neither of us, and no one I knew, had ever been before.I bought a Greyhound ticket for a predictably hellish journey to Montreal that featured five bonus hours at the border when a fellow passenger was taken in by the police for extended questioning. I reunited with Alan, spent the dredges of my money on my half of the ferry passage and a rental car; a driving atlas of Atlantic Canada; bread, tomatoes and tins of anchovies; and tried to push the fears of financial ruin from my head as best I could. Then we drove through New Brunswick and across Nova Scotia, watching the familiarity of storefronts and landscapes dissipate in the rear view. We slept in the car in a Tim Hortons parking lot, the last bastion of brand recognition for the remainder of the trip. In the morning we woke and swam in the frigid North Atlantic along a beach of auburn sand. We hadn\u2019t left the mainland yet, but already I had never been to a place so empty \u2014 not deserted, just never quite settled in the first place.We reached the North Sydney port at midnight, put the car in the bowels of the ferry and climbed up to the deck for the six-hour passage across Cabot Strait. I promptly began to panic \u2014 I was prone to seasickness. Why had I chosen to take myself on an extended boat ride? Perhaps some cheap wine and an overpriced cupcake would have been a better analgesic for my particular troubles. I downed a dose of Duane Reade-brand sleeping pills from the bottom of Alan\u2019s knapsack and sat on a bench waiting for stomach pains to overtake me. I woke in the morning with a stiff neck, and Newfoundland on the horizon.I was still very stoned from the medication and took a series of ill-framed photos from the side of the boat \u2014 gray crags on which the first lighthouses and trap sheds were perched. All around, the shimmering navy blue water marked the real distance I had come, so different from the beryl Adriatic or the brown churn of the South Jersey Atlantic.At our first stop, we learned, among other things, that we were pronouncing Newfoundland wrong. We had driven those first hours with no plan, sticking to the main road on which the ferry dropped us, stopping only when we came to what looked like a traveling carnival. A young couple who had marked us as strangers from across the field were patient through our bungled explanation of what exactly we were doing in Newfoundland, and offered us some fast facts: It was NEW-fin-land \u2014 the \u201cnew\u201d stressed, the \u201cfound\u201d compressed, the \u201cland\u201d wide and stretched at the \u201ca\u201d; this was the Deer Lake strawberry festival and baking competition; and that was the mayor over there in the tent, judging the cakes.Was there a good local beer we should try? we asked. The two conferred for a moment, then said, decisively, \u201cCoors Light.\u201dWe slept on the beach, woke at dawn rigid with cold, and resolved to choose our next destination based solely on the attractiveness of its name. The map was full of promises of the undiscovered, coves and lookout points, brooks and bights each harboring a secret second chance.One name in particular drew me in each time I looked at the map: Twillingate. A word so full of twinkle and twilight it felt as if it was getting away with something. It was out of the way, far from everything, but that seemed fitting. \u201cLet\u2019s go to Twillingate,\u201d I said. And because he was gracious, or maybe because he was thinking the same thing, Alan agreed.We drove northeast and climbed the Tablelands, a desaturated Martian landscape with mountain peaks inverted into snow-filled craters. We abandoned the plastic knife we\u2019d been using to cut the tomatoes, and instead bit into them and ate them whole like apples. We stopped for gas in Wiltondale and found in the station\u2019s cooler, the kind in which one encounters ice cream in a bodega, a pair of frozen rabbits.In the town bar the server looked at us with incredulity when we said we were from New York. Was I living just like they did on \u201cSex in the City?\u201d she wanted to know. I thought of the heat and my room share and my former husband. \u201cNot exactly,\u201d I said. We forewent the house special (canned moose and onions) in favor of mooseburgers. Was there a good local beer we should try? we asked. She nodded and brought us Coors Light.In the morning we ate tomatoes and strawberries on the hood of the car, then drove all day, passing through Summerford and New World Island, and arriving at Twillingate before sunset. I was both giddy and apprehensive about whether the place could live up to its name, and pulled over so we could go by foot. Here was the lighthouse, red and white just as I had imagined it; here were the jagged cliffs lush with wild grass. I stood on a decaying picnic bench at the edge of an overhang to study the horizon. Icebergs thrust up from the glassy water, their tips tapered to points by the summer sun.We ate cod and scallops with baked apple and local berries in the town\u2019s restaurant. No one much lived here anymore, the waitress said (she went to school in St. John\u2019s), but they all came back for the summer. We slept in the car in a bank parking lot that overlooked the ocean; in the moments before sleep I conjured plans for an ordinary life in Newfoundland, one made slightly better by grassy cliffs and salty air.In the morning, we pressed on toward St. John\u2019s. The towns on the way were smaller, the accents more pronounced. In Frederickton we slipped (undetected, we thought) into the back pew of a weatherboard church, where the congregants were singing hymns a cappella and by heart in what was approaching an Irish brogue. The pastor gathered the children in front of the altar and snapped his fingers in their faces when they failed to pay attention, then commanded them to sing the \u201cwelcome song\u201d and give us bags of hard candy.We passed through Lumsden and Newtown, stopped to roam among endless mazes of lobster traps on the docks. And in Gambo I ate the biggest portion of soft-serve ice cream I\u2019ve had to date. The closer we got to St. John\u2019s the colder it became \u2014 the east coast unbuffered from the ocean winds\u2019 true power. At night it was so cold in the car I woke and buried myself beneath a heap of our dirty clothes to keep from shivering.Then, finally, we dipped south to the Avalon Peninsula, and reached St. John\u2019s the next afternoon. While most of the province was dark blues and greens, St. John\u2019s was brazen in telegraphing its presence, the downtown lined with rowhouses in fuchsia, yellow and orange. Here there were stores and signs catering to tourists and plaques denoting historical achievements: Some considered St. John\u2019s the oldest English-founded city on the continent; Signal Hill was the site of the first trans-Atlantic wireless communication. But I wondered then and now about the history of those smaller places we had passed through with no plaques to speak of.At night there was music in the streets and crowds filled the pubs even though it was a Tuesday. I felt something inside me switch on again, the excitement of my very first days in New York City, the thrill of a new place alight and alive through the dark. We went to a bar on George Street, said yes to the house dinner special; it was called Brewis, which, in the server\u2019s best description, contained \u201ccodfish and wet bread.\u201d We ordered the beer ourselves.I don\u2019t remember where we slept that night, or the feverish drive back to the ferry port in the days that followed. I don\u2019t remember the boat or bus rides home. New York was still hot and full of the problems I\u2019d left there, and I spent the rest of the summer earning minimum wage by correcting the faulty geocode of Google Maps listings. I never came across any listings for Newfoundland, but sometimes I would type in Twillingate and watch the map zoom northward, allow myself to stand for a moment on the cliff where I could craft an adventure based solely on the mystery of a place\u2019s name, and the promise of the beauty it might hold.An article last Sunday about a trip through Newfoundland misstated the name of a town where the author stopped on the way to St. John\u2019s. It is Lumsden, not Lumberton. The article also misspelled the name of another town the author passed through.

{"Headline": "Tech Giants Gobble Start-Ups in an Antitrust Blind Spot", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDeal ProfessorLike Facebook\u2019s acquisition of WhatsApp, the Walmart deal will probably end up being another example of an upstart internet company being swallowed up to preserve the stranglehold of a giant.This happens because antitrust regulators are stuck in an outdated view of the world, while the internet giants are more attuned to their nascent competitive threats. The deal for Jet.com is just the latest defensive internet acquisition of an emerging start-up that will preserve the hegemony of a select few.And now it is being swallowed up by Walmart.This could be seen as a victory for competition. Walmart will now have a more dynamic management and brand to buttress its own internet sales operation, which trails Amazon by quite a distance. This will allow it to better compete against Amazon. The likely result is that competition in online retailing will eventually be a slugfest between Amazon and Walmart with everyone else thrown by the wayside.The problem with this narrative is that it cements the positions of Walmart and Amazon as the only players in town.This is the modus operandi of the big internet behemoths. They live in fear of new technology disrupting their businesses and killing them off.Mr. Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez was a Facebook product manager when the company faced its greatest threat: Google Plus. Facebook won because it enforced an ethos of all work, all the time, spurred by constant fear of extinction.Facebook and its elite brethren will do anything to make sure they are not the next Yahoo or Radio Shack, killed by disruption and failure to innovate. This translates into paying obscene sums for technology that might challenge their dominance one day.If you don\u2019t believe this, there is a poignant passage in \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d where Mr. Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez notes that Mark Zuckerberg saw that there were two companies with \u201chockey stick growth\u201d that matched Facebook\u2019s own: Instagram and WhatsApp. Both were amassing users at an amazing rate and both were an existential threat to Facebook.Did Mr. Zuckerberg rev up the Facebook machine to try to outcompete them? No. Instead, he bought Instagram for about $1 billion and WhatsApp for an astounding $21.8 billion.Today, Facebook is dominant, with more than 1.7 billion monthly active users. WhatsApp has more than 1 billion monthly active users and Instagram, more than 500 million.Another Google example is YouTube, which was bought for $1.65 billion in 2006 and is now a constant stream of users for Google. Indeed, YouTube, with more than one billion active monthly users, is a top driver of Alphabet\u2019s user growth.Billions of dollars are made in Silicon Valley by selling nascent upstarts to the giants. And the dominant players pay eagerly to remain dominant. That is what is going on with the Jet.com acquisition and perhaps even the $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn by Microsoft.Where are the antitrust authorities in all of this? The guiding standard under the law is that no acquisition should be allowed if it would \u201clessen competition.\u201dUnder the traditional view of antitrust, when Facebook, for example, tries to buy a company like Instagram, it can argue that anyone can start such a website. And there are other competitors like Google and Snapchat. And so this gets past the antitrust authorities, who seem more concerned with how the data will be used rather than the accumulation of users. Both United States and European Union regulators examined the WhatsApp deal, but it passed muster because WhatsApp was viewed as a messenger service, something where there was alternative competition.This misses the point that domination is all about users and views. Those companies with users and page views can dominate, and accumulating those users is everything, something only an infinitesimally small number of companies can find the key to doing.The antitrust system results in the increasing oligopoly that we have, where a few companies dominate major industries, accruing the wealth and power that go with it as potential disrupters are swallowed at birth, the way Cronus, the titan in Greek mythology, ate his young to prevent their uprising.No one knows what might happen to Jet if it remained independent. Perhaps it would fail. Amazon is dominant and Walmart may truly be the only real competitor. The same could be said of any of these acquisitions of high-growth companies. So preventing this acquisition may result not in creating a competitor to Amazon but in the eventual death of Jet. This of course would leave its founder and investors much poorer, a true cost.The flip side of this risk is that the big tech companies continue unchallenged in their dominance. Perhaps it is time to rethink antitrust enforcement, and take the risks associated with a different view of antitrust that looks at potential dominance and at breaking up oligopolies. Rhea protected Zeus from Cronus, which eventually led to Cronus\u2019s destruction.If antitrust authorities do not adapt and emerging competitors continue to be bought up, we should not be surprised of the continued dominance of a very few companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Walmart.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018It Absolutely Has Created Fear\u2019: 2 Killings Prompt Female Joggers to Alter Routines", "Date": "2016-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe two deaths occurred just days apart and had eerily similar details \u2014 each time, a woman went jogging during the day in an isolated area and wound up dead.Though one woman\u2019s body was discovered in Massachusetts and the other in Queens, and the authorities do not believe the two attacks were related, the killings have unnerved many female runners. Some are now rethinking their routines.Around 1:15 p.m. on Sunday, Vanessa Marcotte, 27, left her mother\u2019s home in Princeton, Mass., to go for a run on a wooded country road nearby, according to a spokesman with the Worcester County district attorney\u2019s office. Ms. Marcotte was visiting town from her home in New York City, where she worked as a Google marketing account manager.After she had been gone for more than two and a half hours, the police began looking for Ms. Marcotte. Later that night, a State Police canine unit found her body about a half-mile from her mother\u2019s home. The police began a homicide investigation, but have not made any arrests. An autopsy report had not been completed as of Tuesday afternoon.Police officials in New York said they did not believe the episode was related to the death last Tuesday of Karina Vetrano, 30, in the Howard Beach neighborhood. Ms. Vetrano was sexually assaulted and strangled during a run in a nature preserve near her home, the police said.The news of the two joggers\u2019 deaths has prompted anxiety among female runners in New York City and caused many to question their safety while running alone.\u201cIt absolutely has created fear,\u201d said Kathy Ioannou, leader of the Brooklyn chapter of She Runs This Town, a running group for women. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel comfortable running alone. We\u2019re frightened.\u201dMs. Ioannou, 51, said she had seen a \u201chuge spike\u201d in the last two days of women from her group asking her to set up more group runs so that members did not have to go alone.She has made changes to her own running route, choosing to run in the street against traffic instead of in the golf course near her home in Dyker Heights, Brooklyn. She has also stopped running with headphones and has not left the house without her Road ID, which contains her emergency contact information.In search of long stretches of continuous road, many runners venture to unfamiliar places so they can log more miles. Ms. Ioannou said she had been planning on going to the Howard Beach area for an 18-mile run before she heard about the attack there.\u201cIt brought light to all of us that we just can\u2019t do the things we\u2019re used to doing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t fair, but it\u2019s smart.\u201dAs the peak of the marathon season approaches, many women are leaving home early in the morning \u2014 sometimes while it is still dark \u2014 to try to squeeze long runs into their schedules, said Melody Davis, a Brooklyn resident and a member of the group Black Girls Run.\u201cWhat\u2019s really unnerving is that both of these latest situations happened in daylight,\u201d Ms. Davis said. \u201cThe question becomes, Then when can I go run?\u201dSome members of her group have suggested using phone apps that can map runners\u2019 locations so that relatives can track their whereabouts. Others have been resorting to running in groups or with a dog, she said.Gisela Perez, a Bronx resident, said she carried Mace and sometimes a safety pin to be used as a possible weapon in case of an emergency while running. She said she also tried to avoid going by herself. For other runners, like Martha Rowen, 73, jogging in groups is not an easy alternative; Ms. Rowen, who lives in Brooklyn Heights, said she had a hard time keeping up with younger runners.\u201cIt\u2019s going to probably influence how likely I am to branch out,\u201d Ms. Rowen said about the recent attacks. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m going to be able to feel I can do that.\u201dBut the killings of both Ms. Vetrano and Ms. Marcotte seem to have taken place in areas they were familiar with. And both were avid runners.The Landmark, a newspaper based in Holden, Mass., reported that in 2014, Ms. Marcotte ran in a race to raise money for cancer research, in honor of her uncle. On Tuesday, one friend posted a photo of herself and Ms. Marcotte on Facebook taking part in a race together.For the past year and a half, Ms. Marcotte had been working as an account manager in health care at Google\u2019s New York City office, according to her LinkedIn profile. In a statement, a Google spokeswoman said Ms. Marcotte was \u201cknown for her ubiquitous smile, passion for volunteer work and love of Boston sports.\u201dMs. Marcotte graduated from Boston University's College of Communication in 2011, her LinkedIn profile says, and worked in Boston before moving to New York. Several of her family and friends declined to comment.Jeff Esposito, who lives in the Boston area, worked with Ms. Marcotte for about two years at Vistaprint, a marketing company. He said Ms. Marcotte loved being outside and exercising. \u201cVanessa was a true treat to work with,\u201d he said. \u201cShe is somebody who will be truly, truly missed.\u201dMs. Davis, the runner in Brooklyn, said she hoped that the deaths of Ms. Marcotte and Ms. Vetrano would not stop women from wanting to get outside and run.\u201cI want ladies in our community to continue to do what they love,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want fear to be another deterrent.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about reactions by female runners to the recent killings of two women who were jogging misidentified a jogger who said she carries safety pins as a possible weapon. She is Gisela Perez, not Melody Davis. The article also referred incorrectly to the area where the body of Vanessa Marcotte was discovered. She was found about a half-mile from her mother\u2019s home in Princeton, Mass., not about a mile and a half from there.Susan C. Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Duo Makes Video Calling Between Operating Systems Easier", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "Supported byTech FixGoogle and Apple have battled each other for years for primacy over mobile users. Apple has proferred its superior devices, like the iPhone. Google has fought back with its Android operating system and a series of mobile apps that are more flexible and compatible with a broader set of devices than Apple\u2019s apps.The app fits squarely into Google\u2019s playbook in mobile. Over the last few years, Google has increasingly offered its important software and internet services, including Google Maps, Google Photos and Google Docs, to iPhone customers. All of those apps were compelling alternatives to Apple\u2019s proprietary apps, like Apple Maps, Photos and Notes, because they work on a wider variety of devices, including Macs, Windows PCs, Android devices and iPhones.Duo is no exception. People can only use FaceTime to call others who have Apple devices. But Duo lets you place video calls between Android and iPhone users, and sizably increases the universe of people with whom you can hold a video conversation.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to worry about whether your call will connect, or if your friend is using the same type of device as you are,\u201d Google said in a statement, in a veiled jab at Apple. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder that nearly half of U.S. adults never make video calls on mobile.\u201dAll of this feeds into Google\u2019s strategy to attract iPhone users over to Android. Google\u2019s apps generally work better on Android devices than on iPhones, so the more that people get hooked on Google\u2019s core apps, the less incentive there is to stay loyal to Apple.Nick Fox, Google\u2019s head of communication products, said the top priority with Duo was to build a great product and to increase the use of video calling among Android users. But he added that making Android more attractive to iPhone owners was a secondary motive. He said that Duo\u2019s appeal was that it was simple to use, fast and more widely accessible.\u201cOur view is video calling should work for everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can only call half the people you know, that\u2019s very limiting.\u201d\u201cOur year-to-date iPhone sales to switchers are the greatest we\u2019ve seen in any nine-month period,\u201d Mr. Cook said in the call, without disclosing precise figures.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment beyond Mr. Cook\u2019s comments.I decided to test Duo to see how the new app plays into the debate about whether iPhone users should consider switching to Android devices. After trying an early copy of Duo and comparing it side by side with FaceTime, I found that Duo was just as intuitive and fun to use as FaceTime, but that it was too early to tell which service was more reliable.A Short HistoryThis is not the first time Google has provided video calling. Google started offering mobile video calling several years ago inside its Hangouts app, which also includes messaging and voice-calling capabilities. The video-calling feature in Hangouts will remain intact.Crystal Dahlen, a Google spokeswoman, said the name Duo conveyed that the app was designed for one-to-one video calling on mobile devices, in contrast to Hangouts, which lets groups of people make video calls over mobile devices and computers. Duo will roll out globally over the next few days.FaceTime, in contrast, is now six years old. When Apple unveiled the video-calling ability in iPhones in 2010, Steven P. Jobs, Apple\u2019s co-founder, said he had dreamed of mobile video calling since he grew up watching \u201cThe Jetsons\u201d and \u201cStar Trek.\u201d Apple later expanded FaceTime to work with iPads and Macs, among other Apple products. The company has not published statistics on FaceTime use, but the technology helped make mobile video calling mainstream.Duo Versus FaceTimeThe Duo app is downloadable and free through Google\u2019s Play store and Apple\u2019s App Store. When you open the Duo app, there is just one button: video call. Tapping that loads your contacts list, and from there you can choose whom to call.Duo starts streaming video to a recipient as soon as the call is placed, meaning the person you are calling will be able to see you waving or making faces before he or she picks up. Google calls this feature Knock Knock. It can be disabled in case you have friends who are likely to make inappropriate hand gestures.With FaceTime, you place a call directly through the iPhone\u2019s contacts list or through the separate FaceTime app. The recipient does not see the video streaming until after the call is answered.I placed video calls over Duo and FaceTime over a strong Wi-Fi connection as well as a weak cellular connection. In the tests, the video calls looked clearer on Duo, though that is an unreliable measure because very few people are currently able to use Duo, so the network is unrealistically uncongested. When more people use Duo, we can expect the picture quality to vary depending on network traffic and internet speeds.There is a minor difference for Duo between Android and iPhone users. An Android user receiving a Duo call will see a Knock Knock video on the home screen by default. Those using Apple devices will see a notification on top of the screen and will have to open the Duo app before seeing Knock Knock in action. Otherwise, the app works the same for both Android and iPhone.Against the RestI also compared Duo calls with video calls placed over Microsoft\u2019s Skype and Facebook Messenger. Against those two, Duo\u2019s simplicity won hands down.In Facebook\u2019s Messenger app, the video-calling feature is embedded in the corner of a message box, so it is hard to find and not intuitive to use. In fact, every call I have ever made with Messenger has been by mistake.On Skype, the video-calling feature is in a place similar to Messenger\u2019s, in the corner of a message box. More annoyingly, to find other Skype users you have to manually add them to your Skype contacts list or toggle on an option to synchronize your address book with Skype.The Bottom LineFor now, FaceTime is just as intuitive as Duo so I see no compelling reason to use Duo over FaceTime to call iPhone users.But if I had to video call an Android user, I would use Duo over other video-calling services like Skype or Facebook Messenger, which have more cluttered interfaces than Duo\u2019s single-button approach.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Daily Report: More Clean Energy, Brought to You by the Cloud", "Date": "2016-08-24", "News": "Supported byBitsThe cloud, as it turns out, may have a very green lining.A prime reason for this is the growing demand from its cloud computing centers, where Apple keeps its customers\u2019 music, photos and much more.On this front, Apple joins a number of other cloud providers, who collectively may change the face of energy production by increasing demand for renewable energy.Big cloud-computing companies are building facilities on an unparalleled scale, and at a time when few others are increasing demand. Dominion Virginia Power, which supplies perhaps the world\u2019s greatest concentration of data centers, reported that overall demand rose 1 percent last year, but demand from data centers rose 9 percent.Amazon Web Services has since committed to obtaining 100 percent of its power from renewable sources. Last year the company purchased a 250,000-panel, 80-megawatt plant in Virginia, which it later sold to Dominion.Other data centers have long been situated near big dams, which provide cheap as well as green power. Lots of building is happening in Iowa, Texas and elsewhere in America\u2019s great wind corridor, to encourage the construction of more wind-driven facilities.Remote locations have other benefits. \u201cWhen your nearest neighbor is 100 acres away, you don\u2019t get as many complaints about the power lines,\u201d said Joe Kava, who heads Google\u2019s data center operations.There are signs it is affecting the way utilities plan future construction. American Electric Power, which operates in 11 states, has said it will add 6,300 megawatts of new wind power and 3,100 megawatts of new solar generation before 2033. An AEP official told me that much of this was attributable to demand from data centers.For many of these companies, it\u2019s not just about saving the planet; power has moved from an incidental cost to a main determinant of profitability. Like nothing else, that has affected the operation of data centers in ways that may improve other big companies\u2019 power consumption.The traditional measure of data center efficiency is power usage effectiveness, or P.U.E. This measures how much power goes into a data center and how much of that is used by computing equipment. For a poorly run center, this number can be 2.0 or higher, meaning it takes two watts of power to put one watt into a computer.Together, these companies are building with their clouds a new kind of industrial infrastructure. It would be something if it also reshaped our power usage for the better.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I Lost My Job and My Husband. Then I Found Newfoundland.", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySummertimeDuring my summer break from the M.F.A. program at Columbia University in New York, I found myself amid my first adult crisis. I had been teaching writing at a summer camp for high schoolers, but when it was over, I was unemployed for the first time since I was 16. My husband had gone to an extended business training session in Texas, and while away had discovered a penchant for sleeping with men. I moved out \u2014 first to a shared room in Washington Heights with two mattresses on the floor, where I slept opposite a Russian woman who stayed up staring at me through the dark, then to a sweltering fifth-floor walk-up in East Harlem, an improvement by all accounts, but still dark, moldy and depressing. Broke, heartbroken and profoundly sweaty, I had taken to pacing the apartment sans pants in a diagonal across the sloping faux-parquet floor. When that didn\u2019t work I returned, as I always had, to books.I brought the book back across Morningside Park and allowed myself to steep in it the way I hadn\u2019t really had a chance to since beginning graduate school. Quoyle\u2019s Newfoundland was a balm for my wounds: in each chapter a glimpse beyond the New York heat and the search for another job and a divorce lawyer. Quoyle had made a clean escape from his past; Quoyle lived in a house near the ocean; in Newfoundland there was always a breeze. Newfoundland, a name with the promise of a fresh start built into its very syllables.I\u2019m not sure, exactly, how Newfoundland went from novel setting and daydream to a plan that propelled me to the Port Authority. Having family in Croatia and South Jersey, I spent most of my summers either along the Adriatic coast or down by the Jersey Shore; though neither were without their benefits or even adventures, both were exclusively family affairs, large gatherings of relatives in which I could drift and feel safe. But fate had aligned in such a way that even my risk-averse and very sad self was willing to take a chance. Alan was already in Canada, in Montreal visiting friends. I could meet him there, and we could rent a car. We could go somewhere neither of us, and no one I knew, had ever been before.I bought a Greyhound ticket for a predictably hellish journey to Montreal that featured five bonus hours at the border when a fellow passenger was taken in by the police for extended questioning. I reunited with Alan, spent the dredges of my money on my half of the ferry passage and a rental car; a driving atlas of Atlantic Canada; bread, tomatoes and tins of anchovies; and tried to push the fears of financial ruin from my head as best I could. Then we drove through New Brunswick and across Nova Scotia, watching the familiarity of storefronts and landscapes dissipate in the rear view. We slept in the car in a Tim Hortons parking lot, the last bastion of brand recognition for the remainder of the trip. In the morning we woke and swam in the frigid North Atlantic along a beach of auburn sand. We hadn\u2019t left the mainland yet, but already I had never been to a place so empty \u2014 not deserted, just never quite settled in the first place.We reached the North Sydney port at midnight, put the car in the bowels of the ferry and climbed up to the deck for the six-hour passage across Cabot Strait. I promptly began to panic \u2014 I was prone to seasickness. Why had I chosen to take myself on an extended boat ride? Perhaps some cheap wine and an overpriced cupcake would have been a better analgesic for my particular troubles. I downed a dose of Duane Reade-brand sleeping pills from the bottom of Alan\u2019s knapsack and sat on a bench waiting for stomach pains to overtake me. I woke in the morning with a stiff neck, and Newfoundland on the horizon.I was still very stoned from the medication and took a series of ill-framed photos from the side of the boat \u2014 gray crags on which the first lighthouses and trap sheds were perched. All around, the shimmering navy blue water marked the real distance I had come, so different from the beryl Adriatic or the brown churn of the South Jersey Atlantic.At our first stop, we learned, among other things, that we were pronouncing Newfoundland wrong. We had driven those first hours with no plan, sticking to the main road on which the ferry dropped us, stopping only when we came to what looked like a traveling carnival. A young couple who had marked us as strangers from across the field were patient through our bungled explanation of what exactly we were doing in Newfoundland, and offered us some fast facts: It was NEW-fin-land \u2014 the \u201cnew\u201d stressed, the \u201cfound\u201d compressed, the \u201cland\u201d wide and stretched at the \u201ca\u201d; this was the Deer Lake strawberry festival and baking competition; and that was the mayor over there in the tent, judging the cakes.Was there a good local beer we should try? we asked. The two conferred for a moment, then said, decisively, \u201cCoors Light.\u201dWe slept on the beach, woke at dawn rigid with cold, and resolved to choose our next destination based solely on the attractiveness of its name. The map was full of promises of the undiscovered, coves and lookout points, brooks and bights each harboring a secret second chance.One name in particular drew me in each time I looked at the map: Twillingate. A word so full of twinkle and twilight it felt as if it was getting away with something. It was out of the way, far from everything, but that seemed fitting. \u201cLet\u2019s go to Twillingate,\u201d I said. And because he was gracious, or maybe because he was thinking the same thing, Alan agreed.We drove northeast and climbed the Tablelands, a desaturated Martian landscape with mountain peaks inverted into snow-filled craters. We abandoned the plastic knife we\u2019d been using to cut the tomatoes, and instead bit into them and ate them whole like apples. We stopped for gas in Wiltondale and found in the station\u2019s cooler, the kind in which one encounters ice cream in a bodega, a pair of frozen rabbits.In the town bar the server looked at us with incredulity when we said we were from New York. Was I living just like they did on \u201cSex in the City?\u201d she wanted to know. I thought of the heat and my room share and my former husband. \u201cNot exactly,\u201d I said. We forewent the house special (canned moose and onions) in favor of mooseburgers. Was there a good local beer we should try? we asked. She nodded and brought us Coors Light.In the morning we ate tomatoes and strawberries on the hood of the car, then drove all day, passing through Summerford and New World Island, and arriving at Twillingate before sunset. I was both giddy and apprehensive about whether the place could live up to its name, and pulled over so we could go by foot. Here was the lighthouse, red and white just as I had imagined it; here were the jagged cliffs lush with wild grass. I stood on a decaying picnic bench at the edge of an overhang to study the horizon. Icebergs thrust up from the glassy water, their tips tapered to points by the summer sun.We ate cod and scallops with baked apple and local berries in the town\u2019s restaurant. No one much lived here anymore, the waitress said (she went to school in St. John\u2019s), but they all came back for the summer. We slept in the car in a bank parking lot that overlooked the ocean; in the moments before sleep I conjured plans for an ordinary life in Newfoundland, one made slightly better by grassy cliffs and salty air.In the morning, we pressed on toward St. John\u2019s. The towns on the way were smaller, the accents more pronounced. In Frederickton we slipped (undetected, we thought) into the back pew of a weatherboard church, where the congregants were singing hymns a cappella and by heart in what was approaching an Irish brogue. The pastor gathered the children in front of the altar and snapped his fingers in their faces when they failed to pay attention, then commanded them to sing the \u201cwelcome song\u201d and give us bags of hard candy.We passed through Lumsden and Newtown, stopped to roam among endless mazes of lobster traps on the docks. And in Gambo I ate the biggest portion of soft-serve ice cream I\u2019ve had to date. The closer we got to St. John\u2019s the colder it became \u2014 the east coast unbuffered from the ocean winds\u2019 true power. At night it was so cold in the car I woke and buried myself beneath a heap of our dirty clothes to keep from shivering.Then, finally, we dipped south to the Avalon Peninsula, and reached St. John\u2019s the next afternoon. While most of the province was dark blues and greens, St. John\u2019s was brazen in telegraphing its presence, the downtown lined with rowhouses in fuchsia, yellow and orange. Here there were stores and signs catering to tourists and plaques denoting historical achievements: Some considered St. John\u2019s the oldest English-founded city on the continent; Signal Hill was the site of the first trans-Atlantic wireless communication. But I wondered then and now about the history of those smaller places we had passed through with no plaques to speak of.At night there was music in the streets and crowds filled the pubs even though it was a Tuesday. I felt something inside me switch on again, the excitement of my very first days in New York City, the thrill of a new place alight and alive through the dark. We went to a bar on George Street, said yes to the house dinner special; it was called Brewis, which, in the server\u2019s best description, contained \u201ccodfish and wet bread.\u201d We ordered the beer ourselves.I don\u2019t remember where we slept that night, or the feverish drive back to the ferry port in the days that followed. I don\u2019t remember the boat or bus rides home.

{"Headline": "Is That Real Tuna in Your Sushi? Now, a Way to Track That Fish", "Date": "2016-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPrototypeBeyond Maine lobster, Maryland crabs and Gulf shrimp, fish has been largely ignored by foodies obsessing over the provenance of their meals, even though seafood travels a complex path. Until recently, diners weren\u2019t asking many questions about where it came from, which meant restaurants and retailers didn\u2019t feel a need to provide the information.From a young age, Mr. Auerbach had romantic notions about fishing, specifically the idea of catching fish to feed his family and neighbors.\u201cIt\u2019s cool in this day and age that people wake up in the morning and go make a living interacting with nature and feeding their community,\u201d he said. He went into commercial fishing straight out of college, taking a job on an Alaskan salmon boat and later returning to New England to work on lobster boats and learn more about the fishing industry there.Soon after Mr. Auerbach founded Red\u2019s Best in 2008, he realized that a combination of government regulations and commercial fishing\u2019s embrace of technology were effectively threatening the existence of small fishing boats. Yet smaller boats travel short distances and catch fewer fish, which Mr. Auerbach said improves their quality.\u201cWe try to push people to eat local, traceable fish,\u201d he said.Like most other seafood distributors, he was relying on an antiquated, four-part carbon copy system that was so cumbersome, he was routinely shuffling paperwork until 2 a.m.\u201cThe boat would get a copy at the point of unloading,\u201d Mr. Auerbach said. \u201cThe government would get a copy. I\u2019d file a copy. And then I\u2019d write in the prices.\u201d As for paying the fishermen: \u201cI\u2019d have to get checks and then match the checks to the paperwork and mail them. It was an absolute nightmare that wasn\u2019t scalable.\u201dNow the Red\u2019s Best software does that work. For instance, a company driver backs a truck down to the long wooden pier in Woods Hole, Mass., each afternoon, so that fishermen can load their bluefish, striped bass, bonito, conch, horseshoe crabs and other seafood. But instead of a thick pad of paper and carbon sheets, the driver wields a waterproof wireless computer tablet with a Bluetooth mobile printer.\u201cHe\u2019s putting their catch data directly onto the internet, and our whole staff all over the country can see in real time as fish is being unloaded onto our truck,\u201d Mr. Auerbach said. When the fish arrives at Red\u2019s Best\u2019s Boston plant, it is instantly received into inventory and reported to the federal government.The company affixes a traceability label on each box of fish. The label has a two-dimensional bar code that can be scanned by smartphones to reveal who caught the fish, where and how. A unique web page is automatically created for that fish. Buyers, typically high-end wholesalers throughout the country, and their customers can scan the code to learn the story behind the fish.Mr. Auerbach, who has 100 employees, projects the company will sell 20 million pounds of seafood this year, caught almost exclusively by 1,000 small vessels.Eventually, Red\u2019s Best hopes to sell directly to consumers. \u201cLike, a bluefin tuna is being unloaded right this second in Provincetown, Mass., and you buy a pound of it to be delivered to your home tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cI want that tuna sold as deep into the supply chain as possible.\u201dBy that he means ideally the fish will travel from the company\u2019s Boston hub directly to home cooks\u2019 refrigerators. Currently, people can buy Red\u2019s Best fish at its store at the Boston Public Market, at several farmers\u2019 markets, or shipped through AmazonFresh and, starting last week, FedEx.\u201cI got the data,\u201d he said. \u201cI got the fish. I know people want it.\u201dSea to Table hopes to sell fish directly to home chefs starting this year, too.But local seafood can cost more than many Americans are accustomed to paying, which partly accounts for the rampant seafood fraud in this country.\u201cU.S. fisheries are very well managed and are actually growing nicely,\u201d said Michael Dimin, the founder of Sea to Table. \u201cBut the U.S. consumer\u2019s been trained to buy cheap food, and imported seafood is really cheap because of I.U.U. fishing.\u201d I.U.U. stands for illegal, unreported and unregulated. The result is unsustainably fished, cheap seafood flooding American fish markets and grocery chains.\u201cTo us, the secret is traceability,\u201d Mr. Dimin said. \u201cIf you can shine a light on where it came from, you can make informed decisions.\u201dMr. Auerbach concedes that some local fish is expensive, but he maintains that many lesser-known varieties are affordable. \u201cMaybe halibut and scallops are for the wealthy,\u201d he says. \u201cBut dogfish, skate, porgy and mackerel are all very inexpensive, healthy and great tasting.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The hope is that the money will be an incentive to keep those flaws out of the hands of organized groups or spy agencies willing to pay big money to learn about them.But Apple had stayed away from the practice. Instead, it had credited anyone who turned over bugs by putting their names on its website \u2014 a far cry from the tens of thousands of dollars, and in some cases hundreds of thousands of dollars, companies like Google and Facebook were willing to pay.The annual Black Hat conference, now in its 19th year, is a gathering place for all sorts of experts on computer security, including hackers, tech industry executives and government officials.Dan Kaminsky, a respected security researcher, said in a keynote speech that the industry was falling far short of expectations. The onslaught of regular, high-profile hacks, like the recent penetration of computers run by the Democratic National Committee, is beginning to make customers believe that little can be done to protect them.\u201cWe made promises in technology, and people are starting not to believe them\u201d Mr. Kaminsky told the audience. \u201cEverybody looks busy but the house still burns.\u201d Mr. Kaminsky argued for a cybersecurity equivalent of the National Institutes of Health or a Manhattan Project to fund research.Notably, a fund-raiser for Hillary Clinton coincided with this year\u2019s conference. Tickets for the \u201cHackers for Hillary\u201d fund-raiser were going for anywhere from $100 to $2,700.

Here\u2019s a summary in one sentence: A teenager gets a job at a local nursing home, and the quality of care declines for a while before improving. You still awake? Keep reading. Like a number of British things \u2014 toad-in-the-hole, spotted dick and Black Sabbath come to mind \u2014 the novel is much tastier than its description would lead you to believe.If Lizzie were an American teenager living in 2016, her motivating thrust might be the desire to secure admission at an Ivy League school or acquire an Apple Watch. But because it is 1977 and Lizzie lives in Leicestershire, her primary goal is to get and keep a job, for reasons both acquisitive (a desire to buy upmarket shampoo and pastel underwear printed with the days of the week) and poignant (a desire to be wanted and needed by other people). Her secondary goal is to avoid truant officers who might wrangle her back to school, thereby thwarting goal No. 1.Supervision is generally absent in Lizzie\u2019s life. Her family is \u2014 what\u2019s a good term here? I\u2019ll say \u201cchaotic.\u201d There\u2019s a stepfather, an indistinct number of siblings, and a mother whose past is spotted with drinking, drug use, random disappearances and a slide into poverty. When Lizzie spots a sign advertising jobs at the nursing home, she decides to apply. \u201cI was longing for something that might blossom into a new phase that didn\u2019t involve \u00adhorses, or school or becoming a punk,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI loved the idea of being professionally compassionate.\u201dThe home is Paradise Lodge, which is the sort of John Milton joke that could appear only in a British novel, and its operating status is best described, to use an American colloquialism, as \u201csketchy.\u201d An estate owner, strapped for cash, has converted his manor into a holding pen for the infirm elderly. Laundry goes unwashed, dentures are accidentally switched, and the on-site morgue is located directly beside the pantry. When the kitchen runs out of everything except tinned pie filling and instant custard, patients are served dessert instead of square meals. When they ask why, they are told \u201cthey\u2019d just had shepherd\u2019s pie and peas but must\u2019ve forgotten all about it.\u201d The owner walks around nude. Everyone is pretty happy.Lizzie completes her auxiliary-nurse duties with zeal, powdering patients with an antifungal agent and administering hot bedtime drinks through sippy cups. She cleans false teeth and wipes bottoms and mops up accidents. A patient bites her. All of these experiences are more appealing to her than attending school, which implies something troubling about the Leicestershire education system.Stibbe has a gift for summoning the high-octane low-attention-span pimple\u00adfest that is adolescence. Like all teen\u00adagers, Lizzie is part child, part adult and part monster; she cycles through moods as quickly as one cycles through socks. Her universe is vivid and studded with sociological details that may or may not signify class distinctions \u2014 this, alas, is a disadvantage that plagues foreign readers of British novels. What is a Goblin Teasmade, for example, and what kind of person owns one? What is leccy? What does \u201cgormless\u201d mean? What\u2019s Dream Topping? Most of these mysteries can be solved with context clues, and what can\u2019t be gleaned can be Googled. \u201cGranary bread,\u201d I learned, is a brownish loaf with more folic acid than white bread. \u201cBrewer\u2019s droop\u201d refers to erectile dysfunction. I look forward to incorporating the above into my everyday vocabulary.In \u201cParadise Lodge,\u201d as in life, there\u2019s not much plot, but there are incidents galore. There is also a great deal of death, which you may find odd based on the merry tone of this review. But it is, in fact, a merry book. Death comes to Lizzie\u2019s workplace the way an expired yogurt might come to one of your co-workers on a Tuesday morning. It happens; it is dealt with; the day moves on, and perhaps a joke is cracked. Our young heroine sees the world through glasses tinted not rose, exactly, but at least salmon or mauve.Molly Young is a contributing writer at The New York Times Magazine. Advertisement"}

But for those who have done the basics, here are some great new additions to the city:It\u2019s a captivating little \u2026 museum? Gallery?

The other is the enhanced data on Google Maps, which has worked with a local nonprofit to map the streets and businesses in 26 favelas.I tested both at the Chap\u00e9u Mangueira and Babil\u00f4nia communities above the Leme neighborhood and found each very helpful. They\u2019re incomplete \u2014 the winding passages and narrow staircases that stand in for streets are impossible to document fully.

Once inside, I should have skipped a second line to what I thought was the main exhibition but turned out to be for an introductory film in Portuguese. (The rest of the exhibition is trilingual, with English and Spanish.) Museum officials later told me that they plan to improve signage and will eliminate lines outside during the Games by restricting entrance to those who buy timed tickets online. Alas, up until press time that could only be done in Portuguese.Advertisement"}

Vel\u00e1zquez of New York, saw two men playing and realized his mistake.\u201cI looked it up on Google Maps and realized there is a new Grandstand,\u201d Wiley said Monday. \u201cI had to run over there. And then later I had to run back to see M\u00f3nica Puig play in the old Grandstand.\u201dFor one year only \u2014 and perhaps for only a few more days \u2014 there are two Grandstands at the U.S.T.A. Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. One is the flashy new 16-sided stadium, a hexadecagon that holds 8,125 spectators and will henceforth be known as the Grandstand. The other is the old Grandstand, a gritty shoe box that holds about 6,000 fans and latches on to one side of Armstrong.That court, the site of so many rollicking matches over the years, has long been a fan favorite.\u201cI used to love the old Grandstand,\u201d Wozniacki said. \u201cSo when I heard they were tearing it down, I was really upset because it was one of my favorite courts ever. The intimacy of the court, and people were so close \u2014 it was a great atmosphere.\u201dBut, she added after her match at the new Grandstand, \u201cI walked in there today, and I was like, \u2018This court is really awesome.\u2019\u201dWozniacki has the distinction of being the first player to win at the new Grandstand, inaugurating it in fine style by beating Townsend, 4-6, 6-3, 6-1. Then John Isner and Frances Tiafoe, two American men, played a mini-epic there, with Isner coming from behind to win, 3-6, 4-6, 7-6 (5), 6-2, 7-6 (3), in 3 hours 27 minutes under a blazing sun.Even as the temperature soared into the afternoon, players and fans alike seemed to appreciate the new stadium. Many of the fans gathered in the shade from the white canopy that rims half the building, and the nearly circular design reminded some of Court 1 at Roland Garros in Paris, which is known as the bullring for its shape.Even after her disappointing loss, Townsend voiced her appreciation.\u201cThe court is amazing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful. I didn\u2019t realize how big it was until people started to come in and started to get a little more packed and people started cheering. To see the improvements they\u2019ve made in the course of the year, it\u2019s amazing.\u201dDarryl Baynes, a 54-year-old firefighter and tennis instructor from Watertown, Mass., said he had been attending the U.S. Open for 20 years and had always liked the old Grandstand. But he found a spot of shade under the overhang of the new one and watched as Isner made his comeback against Tiafoe.\u201cIt\u2019s like a bigger version of Court 17,\u201d he said, referring to the show court that opened in 2011. \u201cI always liked the old Grandstand, where people used to hang over the edge from Armstrong and look down on the action there.\u201dLuray Rusnock, a human resources official at a public library in Linden, N.J., looked out on the new Grandstand from a walkway that surrounds much of the court and said she loved it. Her son, Adam Rusnock, a data executive in Manhattan, had brought her to the Open as a Mother\u2019s Day gift.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty easy to get around, and the food court is right there. If you\u2019re in the shade, it\u2019s wonderful. It\u2019s really wonderful.\u201dBut the old Grandstand still has a place in the hearts of many.It was supposed to have been used only as a practice court this year and then torn down during construction on a new, roofed Louis Armstrong Stadium, expected to be finished in time for the 2018 Open. But because of a problem with the playing surface on Court 10, the Open organizers decided on Saturday to use the old Grandstand for matches.Work has continued on Court 10, and players may begin practicing on it as soon as Tuesday. It could also still host some matches, a possibility that leaves the old Grandstand\u2019s status up in the air.On Monday, Vasek Pospisil of Canada beat Jozef Kovalik of Slovakia, 6-1, 6-3, 6-3, in front of a vocal contingent of Canadian supporters at the old Grandstand. Pospisil had never played a singles match there, but now he, too, has an unexpected memory from the stadium.\u201cThe fans are really close, and it feels like everyone is looking over you,\u201d he said. \u201cI like when the fans are close and there is a good atmosphere.\u201dAfter Pospisil\u2019s match, Puig, who won the Olympic women\u2019s singles gold medal for Puerto Rico this month, took a 4-1 lead in her first set against Saisai Zheng behind strong support from the crowd. But Puig, perhaps exhausted from the Rio Games and the celebrations that followed, faded quickly, and Zheng won, 6-4, 6-2.\u201cThe calendar doesn\u2019t give you much room,\u201d Puig said.Wiley, the community coordinator, was there to support Puig, saying his boss\u2019s district, which includes parts of Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens, had many residents of Puerto Rican descent. Wiley did not have the privilege of seeing Puig win, but he did have the distinction of seeing matches at two Grandstands on the same day \u2014 something that, after this year, may never be possible again.\u201cI don\u2019t know why they can\u2019t have two Grandstands,\u201d Wiley said. \u201cI like them both.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They were the catalysts for Facebook\u2019s partnership to build classroom software with Summit Public Schools.Facebook is out to upend the traditional student-teacher relationship.Rather than have teachers hand out class assignments, the Facebook-Summit learning management system puts students in charge of selecting their projects and setting their pace. The idea is to encourage students to develop skills, like resourcefulness and time management, that might help them succeed in college.\u201cAs parents and kids and teachers get access to this type of learning, I think more and more will want it,\u201d Diane Tavenner, the co-founder and chief executive of Summit Public Schools, said in a telephone interview.But the Summit-Facebook system, called the \u201cSummit Personalized Learning Platform,\u201d is different.The software gives students a full view of their academic responsibilities for the year in each class and breaks them down into customizable lesson modules they can tackle at their own pace. A student working on a science assignment, for example, may choose to create a project using video, text or audio files. Students may also work asynchronously, tackling different sections of the year\u2019s work at the same time.The system inverts the traditional teacher-led classroom hierarchy, requiring schools to provide intensive one-on-one mentoring and coaching to help each student adapt.This summer, more than 1,500 educators and leaders of public, private and charter schools participating in the program, called Summit Basecamp, attended sessions to learn how to use the system. Among the 19 schools that introduced the new learning approach last year, at least a few educators and administrators reported a steep learning curve.\u201cThere were many points where we weren\u2019t sure the Summit Basecamp model was what our students needed,\u201d said Claire Fisher, the principal of Urban Promise Academy, a public middle school in Oakland, Calif., which introduced the platform in its sixth-grade classes.By the end of the school year, however, 31 percent of the school\u2019s sixth graders were reading at or above their grade level, compared with just 9 percent in the fall. That was a larger improvement in reading than students in seventh and eighth grades, which did not use the platform, Ms. Fisher said.Advertisement"}

It wants the Alexa Voice Service, which powers Echo, to be an ingredient in devices around the home and beyond, even if they aren\u2019t made by Amazon.The vision of an omnipresent intelligent assistant is one Amazon shares, in one form or another, with most other big technology companies, including Apple, Google and Microsoft. Along with a handful of start-ups, these companies see their intelligent assistants as powerful new ways for users to interact with devices and internet services \u2014 just as smartphone touch screens were.Many technology specialists think that people will be O.K. with a single intelligent assistant in their lives but that most won\u2019t have the patience to regularly use two or three of them, each with its individual quirks. As a result, each company is racing to weave its assistant into as many devices and services as possible.\u201cWe\u2019re taking $180 worth of utility and adding it into a $200 device,\u201d he said.Ford Motor is working with Amazon to integrate Alexa into its vehicles so drivers can control smart-home features like lights, thermostats and security systems from their cars.Over 10,000 developers have registered to integrate Alexa into their products, Amazon said. It won\u2019t say how many Echo units it has sold, except to say that millions of devices with Alexa in them have been purchased.In an interview this spring, David Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for devices, said that the company wanted there to be as many Alexa-linked \u201cendpoints\u201d around the home as possible and that Amazon did not really care who made those devices. Amazon has expanded its lineup of devices that use Alexa with its Echo Dot, a miniature version of the Echo speaker, and Amazon Tap, a portable Bluetooth speaker.\u201cThe longer-term vision is a little bit like the \u2018Star Trek\u2019 computer,\u201d Mr. Limp said. \u201cCaptain Kirk or Picard could sit on the bridge and ask anything and get the right answer.\u201dBut while Amazon has made a lot of progress in this regard, it may have a hard time extending Alexa\u2019s reach outside the home because of its weaknesses in mobile technology, analysts say.The success of Echo has been described as a redemption of sorts for Amazon after it suffered a brutal defeat in the smartphone market with its Fire Phone, which the company stopped selling after poor sales \u2014 a misstep that has left Amazon vulnerable.Apple and Google have clear advantages over Amazon because of their dominant positions in the mobile market. And they are pushing their versions of Alexa \u2014 Siri and Google\u2019s assistant \u2014 as ways to control other devices throughout the home.As intelligent assistants improve in quality, Jan Dawson, an analyst at Jackdaw Research, thinks people will want these virtual helpers to follow them all day like a companion. \u201cWhat you want from an assistant is that they are always available to you everywhere,\u201d he said.While Amazon could eventually give people access to Alexa\u2019s functions through apps on smartphones (a couple of apps from independent developers do this already), Mr. Dawson is skeptical that Amazon will be able to make them work as well as assistants more deeply integrated into smartphones by Apple and Google.\u201cThey\u2019re basically absent on smartphones, which are devices we take everywhere we go,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

She was not so interested in what was happening on the water.\u201cYou will notice that the commentators are not speaking French,\u201d she said, indignantly. \u201cIn the venue, none of the signs are in French.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a struggle each time you have the Olympic Games, in a different country and a different city,\u201d Ms. Jean said. \u201cWe must be there to make sure the French signs and documents and information are there. We have 3,000 athletes and a lot of people in the public from Francophone countries.\u201dThe reports tend to reflect a mixture of hopefulness and dismay.\u201cIn Beijing, all Olympic signage appeared first in French, then English and Chinese,\u201d the Sochi report says, for instance. \u201cIn Sochi, the signage addressing the international audience was trilingual, but that addressing the spectators appeared in Russian and English.\u201dIn addition, it pointed out, \u201cthe arrival of some new sports to the Olympic program (slopestyle and halfpipe) was not accompanied by a terminology sufficient for these disciplines to be discussed with French terms in the media.\u201dThe Olympics are \u201cobviously a very important showcase,\u201d said Mr. Dibango, who is also serving as a cultural ambassador, performing with Brazilian and French-speaking musicians in Rio as a way to promote the international nature of French.\u201cI see the job as being the flag-bearer of the 300 million people around the world who speak French,\u201d Mr. Dibango said.The average member of the public may have little idea that any of this is going on, but the Francophonie organization takes the issue so seriously that no sooner does one Olympics end than it starts negotiating the terms of the next one. Early discussions about French at the Rio Games were positive, Ms. Jean said, because the Brazilian government was sympathetic and because Carlos Nuzman, the president of the Brazilian organizing committee, speaks fluent French.But then the economy collapsed and the friendly government fell. When the new government came in, it had a lot on its mind, and that did not include the use of French at the Olympics. As the day of the opening ceremony approached, the Francophonie organization had no idea how the evening \u2014 traditionally a fine time for the world to hear and appreciate a lot of beautifully enunciated French spoken by important international officials \u2014 would go.It turned out to be a runaway success. All the main announcements and speeches were delivered in French, along with English and Portuguese. Even better, Ms. Jean said, \u201ceverything was announced first in French \u2014 did you notice?\u201dThe opening ceremony is one thing; the rest of the Olympics is another. Ms. Jean visited the athletes\u2019 village, only to discover that there were French-language signs in the cafeteria but nowhere else. She attributed it to Rio\u2019s budget woes \u2014 translation is expensive \u2014 and the frantic nature of pre-Games preparations. While she understood, she said, \u201cWe were very disappointed at the situation.\u201dVisitors to the Games, too, will see that the thousands of signs at the various event venues are printed only in English and Portuguese, not in French. (Not that the English signs are anything to get excited about, seeming at times to owe more to Google Translate than to a sentient being. \u201cPress the wheelchair button if you have locomotion issues,\u201d a sign next to an elevator at the media center reads. )At the rowing venue on Saturday, the events moved along so quickly that sometimes it was all the announcers could do to pack in the commentary in both Portuguese and English, never mind any other languages. In the stands, several (non-French-speaking) spectators said that, to be honest, language was not at the forefront of their minds.\u201cI hadn\u2019t really thought about it,\u201d said Amy Burba, 44, of Virginia. \u201cBut I heard the people behind us speaking French.\u201dScott MacRae, a Scottish chef who was holding a beer and wearing his Union Jack on his head as a form of sun protection, said that except at the opening and closing ceremonies, French should be kept out of the Olympics.\u201cI like the French passion,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to use French at the Olympics when you have them in a country that is not France.\u201dSeveral older-generation rowing officials at the site bemoaned the loss of French not just at the Olympics but also in sports (and in the world) in general. Americans in particular, they said, do not speak other languages and do not really want to.As Mr. Rolland talked nostalgically about the days when rowing meetings were held in French and English speakers had to listen to the translation on headphones, the Rolling Stones song \u201c(I Can\u2019t Get No) Satisfaction\u201d began playing over the loudspeakers.\u201cIt\u2019s a daily fight,\u201d he said. \u201cA daily fight.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the Olympics for which Micha\u00eblle Jean was le Grand T\u00e9moin.

She refers to the government\u2019s \u201ctyrannical rape of our private data,\u201d a disturbing choice of words given fsociety\u2019s collaboration with Julian Assange\u2019s WikiLeaks and its own less than stellar track record with both rape and private data.\u201cWe will destroy you!\u201d she barks at the feds, once again adopting \u201cwar on terror\u201d verbiage \u2014 not a promising route to success.

She goads Trenton about her Muslim faith in an attempt to escape: \u201cIs that what this is about? ISIS or something?\u201d And proceeding to call them a bunch of animals.It does her no good, though, since the moment she slips loose she tries to attack Trenton and winds up banging her head on the wall, knocking herself out. Realizing she\u2019ll need medical care, the frightened foursome frantically search her personal accounts for information with which to blackmail her before they take her to a hospital, and discover that she\u2019s been sleeping with judges in exchange for more favorable verdicts. As their leader, Darlene volunteers to confront Jacobs with their discovery \u2014 but instead tazes her and leaves her to drown in her swimming pool, committing a murder that had been on her mind ever since she was 4 years old and saw Jacobs laughing about the case that killed her and Elliot\u2019s father.From there, things manage to get even uglier, somehow. Darlene and Cisco take Jacobs\u2019s body to the pet crematory they use to dispose of evidence, and are forced to remove her body from the suitcase they\u2019d packed it in and jam it directly into the oven. Mobley and Trenton return home, looking over their shoulders, jumping at every sound \u2014 jittery editing and sudden crash cuts heighten the sense of fear. Sure enough, Mobley is arrested by Dom DiPierro, but she has no idea how high up he is, suspecting him merely of being the D.J. at fsociety\u2019s party the night of the hack. Her superior forces her to let him go in light of the bad press that the bureau is already receiving. He signals to Trenton that they\u2019ve been burned and have to flee, but never shows up at their designated meeting place. Darlene, meanwhile, sleeps at Cisco\u2019s place, and awakens to discover that he\u2019s reporting on her to the Dark Army; the episode ends when she smashes his laptop, then hits him in the head with a baseball bat.Even the relatively tangential Angela has a terrible time of things. She has an ugly confrontation with one of her father\u2019s working-class friends; he hits her with crude sexual insults, she responds with classist cheap shots. She sings a joyless rendition of Tears for Fears\u2019 \u201cEverybody Wants to Rule the World\u201d at karaoke, then ditches her boyfriend for an older man of dubious intent played by Mark Moses (Duck Phillips of \u201cMad Men\u201d). This, perhaps, is for the best, since said boyfriend was an undercover F.B.I. agent, but even so \u2014 just ask Peggy Olson how dating Duck Phillips turned out.But in Elliot\u2019s absence, the episode\u2019s true star is the composer Mac Quayle\u2019s score. The show\u2019s usual electronic hum is complemented, and at times supplanted, by screeching strings and dissonant jolts straight out of a horror film. Which, of course, is what the episode really is: a monster movie, if only in the Nietzschean sense. Darlene has dedicated her life to fighting monsters, and now she\u2019s become one herself.

He took over leadership of the team after Sebastian Thrun, the Stanford computer scientist and founder of Google X laboratory, left in 2013.Johnny Luu, a spokesman for Alphabet, the parent company of X, the company\u2019s research division that oversees the car project, confirmed Mr. Urmson was planning to leave.\u201cSeven years ago, the idea that a car could drive itself wasn\u2019t much more than an idea. Chris has been a vital force for the project, helping the team move from a research phase to a point where this lifesaving technology will soon become a reality. He departs with our warmest wishes,\u201d Mr. Luu wrote in an email message.The departures come after Google\u2019s decision last year to hire John Krafcik, the former president and chief executive of Hyundai America, to be chief of the car project, as part of a plan to spin the effort out as a stand-alone company under the Alphabet umbrella.The X research group, often called Google\u2019s \u201cmoonshot\u201d division, is under increasing pressure to show that at some point the company can expect a financial windfall from its projects. Google\u2019s self-driving car project has been a pioneer in autonomous vehicle technology, but a commercial version of the car is still likely to be several years away.Mr. Urmson has been unhappy with the direction of the car project under Mr. Krafcik\u2019s leadership and quarreled privately several months ago with Larry Page over where it was headed, according to two former Google employees. A spokesman for Google declined to comment on those discussions, but Mr. Urmson disputed they were a reason for his departure.After the dispute, Mr. Urmson decided to take the summer off and only recently decided to leave the company. He told members of the self-driving car team about his decision on Thursday, the former employees said.As a researcher at Carnegie Mellon, Mr. Urmson was a member of a team of engineers that placed second in the 2005 Darpa Grand Challenge contest for autonomous vehicles that was won by a rival team from Stanford, led by Mr. Thrun. In 2007, Carnegie Mellon got revenge when it placed first in the Darpa Urban Challenge, while the Stanford team finished second.Earlier this year, a group of Google employees, led by Anthony Levandowski, former Google Car engineer, and Lior Ron, the product lead for Google Maps, left to found the self-driving truck start-up Otto, which is based in San Francisco.More recently, two other Google car engineers, Dave Ferguson and Jiajun Zhu, who are considered experts on so-called machine vision technology, left to found an as-yet-unannounced start-up, according to the two people with knowledge of the Google car project.Advertisement"}

A witty recurring visual joke is made of the aisle signs on which \u201ccold beer\u201d and \u201cimported beer\u201d are listed separately, as are \u201cbuns\u201d and \u201cbread.\u201d Otherwise, she feels the absence of love and, especially, money in her life. On both counts, she blames her family.Her father, a gun-toting psychiatrist, she describes as rage-filled when not high, sexually inappropriate with her and his female patients and emotionally abusive (in \u201chate letters\u201d he calls her worthless). Her doctor-brother and stay-at-home sister-in-law come off as somehow worse. \u201cThere is no such thing as a happy family,\u201d Janowitz says. \u201cI have met happy families, and after a few minutes one of them takes you off to one side to explain the real truth.\u201dBut if her family is Exhibit A in humanity\u2019s capacity for awfulness, she makes her way through the full alphabet, complaining about everyone from a policeman who gave her a ticket for carrying her dog onto the subway to the journalist and editor Mary Cantwell \u2014 \u201ccold, superior and malevolent\u201d \u2014 under whom she worked at Mademoiselle. It\u2019s surprising Janowitz writes of disliking \u201cthat pretentious, obnoxious\u201d Holden Caulfield, when she seems to see the world through his gray-tinted glasses. \u201cIn my opinion,\u201d she writes, \u201call of humankind is one bad genetic experiment.\u201dThe feeling appears to be somewhat mutual. A hospital reports her to Adult Protective Services for suspected elder abuse. An accountant grows irate when Janowitz bounces a check. Her neighbor sends a threatening letter over extreme, perplexing measures Janowitz takes to protect a rhododendron. Her brother sues her for having used her mother\u2019s accounts to pay her own bills, which she learns constitutes fraud. \u201cThere are some people on this planet who irritate others,\u201d Janowitz writes. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t intentional, but I was one of them.\u201dReaders of this book might grow irritated, too. \u201cYou want to have rich friends, if you are poor, but you want to have their money,\u201d she writes, while complaining that Andy Warhol didn\u2019t buy things for her when they went to flea markets. It\u2019s one of several dubious second-person pronouncements. Another: \u201cYou don\u2019t get involved with your apartment neighbors if you can help it.\u201d (Again, Mister Rogers might disagree.)Like a punk arriving late to class with neither paper nor pencil, she raises lack of curiosity to an art form. \u201cI have the book, somewhere,\u201d she says of something she would have included had it been on hand. Of Bob Guccione\u2019s very Google-able mansion, she says, \u201cProbably there are pictures of this somewhere.\u201d The absence of much in the way of exposition raises some questions, like how did she wind up with eight poodles? And does her husband care that she\u2019s dating her contractor?The book is so raw it\u2019s literally unfinished. In place of a conclusion, she has a chapter called \u201cNo Conclusion,\u201d in which she wonders how her brother\u2019s case against her will turn out. In her postscript, rather than tying up loose ends, she describes a visit to a rural strip club, where \u201cbored girls in bikini tops and panties\u201d use antibacterial wipes on the pole. One, \u201creeking of dirty hair,\u201d nuzzles her face. \u201cHow much will I have to pay to keep her away from me?\u201d Janowitz wonders. Upon exiting, she notices that a skunk has sprayed just outside the building. It\u2019s as if she couldn\u2019t resist providing one more piece of evidence that, whether at the trendiest club in Manhattan or the grimiest one in the woods, the world stinks.Ada Calhoun is the author of \u201cSt. Marks Is Dead.\u201d Her essay collection \u201cWedding Toasts I\u2019ll Never Give\u201d will be published next year.Advertisement"}

Takeover Effort, but Rivals Could Force Its Hand", "Date": "2016-08-15", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsIt was probably only a matter of time before G.M. made a move, after it paid $500 million in January for a stake in Lyft and took a seat on Lyft\u2019s board. In March, the companies unveiled a deal to lease G.M. vehicles to Lyft drivers. They also plan to collaborate on building a fleet of autonomous on-demand vehicles.Speculation about Lyft\u2019s future heated up in June when information emerged that the company had hired the Silicon Valley investment bank Qatalyst Partners, which was founded by Frank Quattrone. Qatalyst is known for helping clients find lucrative exits.Despite the mounting pressures, it\u2019s understandable that Lyft\u2019s founders, Logan Green and John Zimmer, would want to try to stay independent, at least for a while longer. G.M. has been investing heavily in driverless technology, but so have many of its peers, as well as the likes of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, and Apple. So there is no guarantee the carmaker will come up with a winning product.With software, rather than powertrain, a valuable component of autonomous vehicles, Lyft has little incentive to sell for anything other than top dollar. It would also presumably find it easier to recruit top programming talent as an independent company.Lyft may run out of road eventually. Being second to the much-larger Uber is a major disadvantage in an industry where drivers and riders prefer the largest, most active network. An expensive battle for ride-hailing supremacy would distract from the bigger prize: a chance to fundamentally disrupt car ownership with driverless technology \u2014 an opportunity Mr. Zimmer estimates is worth over $2 trillion per year in the United States alone, including the cost of buying, maintaining and insuring cars. That may ultimately direct Lyft to seek an off-ramp that leads to G.M. It just has to hope that when it does, G.M. is still willing to take the wheel.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Celebrity Z-List? Yes, It Exists", "Date": "2016-08-31", "News": "Supported byCritic's NotebookMeet the striving celebrity underclass that has risen to dominate the gossip machine. Aspiring models, third-tier reality show stars, impossible-to-place actors, YouTube vloggers and viral news subjects can now all curry coverage just by replenishing their social media accounts with photos of their babies, their butts or both. These are people you\u2019ve probably never heard of \u2014 or have a nagging suspicion you might have, but don\u2019t quite know why.It used to be that the only way a non-recognizable person could land in the pages of the glossy celebrity magazines was to lose 100 pounds, serve as some heartwarming testimony to good-old-fashioned American values, or be murdered. But in the early aughts, the magazines started diversifying their coverage of Hollywood\u2019s leading Jens and Bens with stories on the romantic dupes and plastic surgery nightmares of reality television. Now, as the rise of social media demolishes the leverage that celebrity tabloids once had over their most famous subjects, the gossip industry keeps defining celebrity downward. (After all, no magazine can match the reach of Taylor Swift\u2019s more than 90 million Instagram fans or Kim Kardashian West\u2019s 47 million Twitter followers.)On a recent episode, they take on Brittany Farrar, the ex-girlfriend of Aaron Rodgers\u2019s little brother, Jordan Rodgers (who is now dating the \u201cBachelorette\u201d star JoJo Fletcher), who recently accused Jordan of cheating in a series of Instagram posts. \u201cWhy are we still hearing about her?\u201d Ms. Weber asked. Mr. Finger replied: \u201cBecause she wants us \u2014 she did her due diligence in making sure we talked about her.\u201d And just like that: A Who was born.Time Inc. has started a kind of general-interest publication on the internet-famous just as the internet has atomized celebrity into a zillion tiny fandoms. Few people are typically energized by the generic category of \u201csocial media figure.\u201d They get their kicks by closely following a select few of their favorite stars, the stars\u2019 friends and family, and a network of (often infighting) fans. The obsessive monitoring of all these channels drums up sufficient drama to create an enduring story line, even if only a few thousand people can manage to follow along. Plus, the setup provides fans the illusion of power in determining which Whos become Thems (Blac Chyna, a rap video vixen engaged to Rob Kardashian, is on her way toward top-level recognition) and which seem destined to fade into permanent obscurity (I\u2019m sorry, Sarah Wright Olsen).But these modern fandoms produce grist for non-fans, too. There\u2019s something deliciously surreal about monitoring the online movements of the barely famous, a class of people who are just unpolished, desperate and savvy enough to act mad, sloppy and sexy. The fact that publications like People and Us Weekly are covering it with a straight face adds another absurd layer.Besides, these people are assaulting our social feeds every day whether we like it or not. Outlets like The Shade Room and \u201cWho? Weekly\u201d have managed to extract bits of hilarity, delight and shame out of that arid media landscape. They have intuited what the traditional tabloids don\u2019t quite get: The pursuit of celebrity has emerged as a grand tabloid narrative in and of itself.Advertisement"}

She wanted character, not shiny out of the box. Some of the cymbals she got were grimy with age and water spots that hinted of concerts in the rain. Others were chipped, dinged and dented.\u201cYou walk through space and you have cause and effect,\u201d she said.But like Mr. Allen himself, who has fingerprints on much of the city\u2019s explosion of growth, geekiness only touches the surface.Now his passion for art, as a collector and benefactor, is resonating too. The fair, which featured 84 galleries from locations as varied as New York, Los Angeles, Seoul and Miami \u2014 up from 60 in its first year \u2014 drew more than 15,000 visitors last year, and had about 18,000 by the fair\u2019s close on Sunday.What the fair says about Seattle, and whether its art community was sufficiently represented, with 18 Pacific Northwest galleries on the roster \u2014 and only 10 from Seattle \u2014 remains a continuing debate.\u201cIf there\u2019s going to be all this energy, and all these collectors coming in from out of town, and critics and press talking about it, we can either, as an art community, sit on the sideline and watch the spectacle, or we can participate and ride that wave. I\u2019m not one to sit out a big opportunity,\u201d said Greg Lundgren, Out of Sight\u2019s founder.\u201cPeople are really trying to rise to the occasion,\u201d said Kirsten Anderson, Roq La Rue\u2019s owner and founder. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard as much complaining this year,\u201d she added.Carl and Jeannette Pergam, both retired physicians who were visiting the fair from a Seattle suburb, said they were struck by the high prices, which they said spoke to them partly about the art\u2019s quality, but also about the wave of wealth in Seattle from the explosion of growth at technology companies like Amazon and Microsoft.\u201cThe ones I would put up on my wall are sparse,\u201d said Ms. Vartanian, 47, a cancer researcher who lives in Seattle. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of important work here.\u201dMr. Allen said in an interview that he pushed no particular vision of what the fair should be about, but that he likes the interplay of intellect and emotion.\u201cThere\u2019s always this interesting tension between fairly intellectual pursuits like science, and more visceral pursuits like art, and how they respond and bond to each other,\u201d he said. He also deeply appreciates, he added, the simple joy of the unexpected.Laura Fried, the Seattle Art Fair\u2019s artistic director, said that she gravitated to what the artists were trying to say about the connection between technology and modern life.\u201cThe conceptual underpinnings are more what I find interesting,\u201d she said.\u201cThe way that we are arranging our world is changing, with digital space merging with physical space,\u201d she said. \u201cI really love thinking about softness in public.\u201dMs. Kasper said she thought about the human stories behind the objects in assembling her cymbals project.

Conversations between friends often begin with comparisons of recent experiences of traffic jams. (My current gripe: an hour to drive six and a half miles from Damansara Heights to Taman Megah, which Google tells me should take 15 minutes.) People become accustomed to their dinner guests\u2019 arriving an hour late; parents wake their children earlier than ever to ensure they get to school on time.As Malaysia navigates its way from developing country to middle-class-nation status, the battle of its capital city against worsening traffic will play a crucial role in shaping the country\u2019s 21st-century identity. Next to its regional neighbors, will it be a choking urban sprawl (think Jakarta) or a hyper-efficient, sustainable metropolis (think Singapore)?Getting these newly middle-class drivers out of their status symbols and onto public transportation is a monumental task, further complicated by the sprawling nature of the suburbs and the network of smaller conurbations that make up greater Kuala Lumpur. In any case, a severe lack of options in mass transit \u2014 with especially poor rail connections outside the metropolitan area \u2014 makes traveling by private car the only choice for many journeys. Only 20 percent of trips in the capital are made by public transportation.The Klang Valley\u2019s principal bus operator, Rapid KL, complains of a chronic shortage of bus drivers to cover its 160 routes, resulting in erratic schedules and low ridership \u2014 the daily passenger total numbers only about 280,000 out of the Klang Valley\u2019s total population of seven million. The city\u2019s two main train lines \u2014 the Light Rail Transit and Monorail \u2014 are efficient and affordable but operate just two routes each.At present, only one 3.5-mile stretch of bicycle lane exists, and Malaysia\u2019s year-round stifling heat makes even the shortest cycle commute uncomfortable. For many residents, the cheap and plentiful taxis are the main alternative; the recent arrival of Uber has provided a further option. But these cars add to, rather than relieve, congestion on the roads.The success of the new rail system is crucial to the ambitions of a city hoping to strengthen its image as one of the world\u2019s friendliest places to do business. It\u2019s also essential to the continued stability of one of Asia\u2019s most racially diverse cities. With sizable ethnic Chinese and Indian communities living alongside the Malay-Muslim majority, the linking of areas traditionally populated by one group or another is key to enabling the city to function as a rich cultural melting pot.As for the ostrich, a young female named Chickaboo, all ended happily. After a brief chase, she was recaptured and safely returned to the farm where she was born. Her escapade was a hit in Kuala Lumpur, personifying what many of us feel: better to take your chances on foot than get caught in rush hour.Advertisement"}

A fist-size tumor had been removed from the stomach of his patient 12 years earlier, but his doctors had not been able to cut out many smaller growths in his liver. The cancer should have killed him, yet here he lay on the table for a routine gallbladder operation.The surgeon, Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg, examined the man\u2019s abdominal cavity, sifting his liver in his fingers, feeling for hard, dense tumors \u2014 but he could find no trace of cancer.It was 1968. Dr. Rosenberg had a hunch he had just witnessed an extraordinary case in which a patient\u2019s immune system had vanquished cancer. Hoping there was an elixir in the man\u2019s blood, Dr. Rosenberg got permission to transfuse some of it into a patient dying of stomach cancer. The effort failed. But it was the beginning of a lifelong quest.\u201cSomething began to burn in me,\u201d he would write later, \u201csomething that has never gone out.\u201dHalf a century later, Dr. Rosenberg, who turns 76 on Tuesday and is chief of surgery at the National Cancer Institute here, is part of a small fraternity of researchers who have doggedly pursued a dream \u2014 turbocharging the body\u2019s immune system so that more cancer patients can experience recoveries like his long-ago patient\u2019s.Dr. Rosenberg, Dr. Carl H. June of the University of Pennsylvania and Dr. Michel Sadelain of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center have been at the forefront of this research for decades, laboring in separate labs in an intense sometimes-cooperative, sometimes-competitive pursuit to bring to fruition a daring therapy that few colleagues believed would work. Now, versions of the therapy for a limited number of blood cancers are nearing approval by federal regulators, and could reach the market as early as next year.The technique, known as cell therapy, gives each patient an individualized and souped-up version of their own immune system, one that \u201cworks better than nature made it,\u201d as Dr. June puts it.The patient\u2019s T-cells, the soldiers of the immune system, are extracted from the patient\u2019s blood, then genetically engineered to recognize and destroy cancer. The redesigned cells are multiplied in the laboratory, and millions or billions of them are put back into the patient\u2019s bloodstream, set loose like a vast army of tumor assassins.This is an unusual pharmaceutical \u2014 a drug that is alive and can multiply once inside the body. Dr. June calls these cells \u201cserial killers.\u201d A single one can destroy up to 100,000 cancer cells.The killer cells are genetically engineered to produce a complex protein, an amalgam of pieces from different parts of the immune system that is unlike anything seen before.\u201cI call it a Frankenstein-like molecule,\u201d said Dr. Renier J. Brentjens, the director of cellular therapeutics at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.This radical, science-fictionlike therapy differs sharply from the more established type of immunotherapy, developed by other researchers. Those off-the-shelf drugs, known as checkpoint inhibitors, release a molecular brake on the immune system, freeing it to fight the cancer much as it fights infections by bacteria or viruses.Cell therapy, in contrast, is brewed specially for each patient, one of the many challenges the field faces in broadening its use. So far, the number of patients treated with cell therapy is in the hundreds, not thousands. And for now it works only for certain types of blood cancers, not common malignancies like breast and lung cancer. Researchers are also still working out how to control potentially lethal side effects. Just recently, a clinical trial was briefly halted after three patients died of brain swelling.Still, cell therapy has produced complete remissions in some patients who were out of treatment options, stirring excitement among doctors and patients and setting off a race among companies to bring the treatments to market.Getting to this point has taken decades of painstaking work, with many false starts and setbacks.\u201cIt was conceivable we were pursuing a ghost,\u201d Dr. Rosenberg recalled.The son of Orthodox Jews who immigrated from Poland to New York and ran luncheonettes, Steven Rosenberg was about 6 years old when his family learned that many relatives, including six of his father\u2019s nine siblings, had been murdered in the Holocaust.\u201cI saw so much evil in the world that early on I decided I wanted to do something that would help people, not hurt people,\u201d he said in an interview here. He received a medical degree from Johns Hopkins and a doctorate in biophysics from Harvard.From the start, he was a workaholic. At one point he tried to call off his relationship with Alice O\u2019Connell, whom he would later marry, because he was afraid it would distract him from research.\u201cI loved the night,\u201d Dr. Rosenberg wrote in his book, \u201cThe Transformed Cell,\u201d published in 1992. \u201cI remember the exhilaration of working through the night in the lab, drinking thick pasty coffee that had been on the burner for hours, walking out into the sunrise.\u201d He added: \u201cTo be alone and out on the edge like that, there was no feeling like it in the world.\u201dWhen Dr. Rosenberg arrived at the National Cancer Institute in 1974, his first attempt at immunotherapy was to give patients T-cells harvested from pigs. That failed.He then began giving patients interleukin-2, or IL-2, a protein made by the body that spurs T-cells to proliferate. In some cases he treated patients with their own white blood cells that had been incubated in IL-2. The treatments sometimes set off such a violent immune system reaction that patients had to be placed in intensive care.From 1980 to 1984, he treated 66 patients without success. Then, in late 1984, he encountered patient No. 67, Linda Taylor, a Navy officer with melanoma whose personnel file carried the stamp \u201cdeath imminent.\u201dThe New York Times would like to hear from doctors and patients who have experience giving or receiving immunotherapy treatment for cancer.Ms. Taylor is still alive; her case and others catapulted Dr. Rosenberg and IL-2 onto the cover of Newsweek and the front pages of newspapers. Some of his colleagues at the National Cancer Institute began referring to him as Stevie Wonder, thinking he had developed a swelled head.But IL-2\u2019s vaunted prowess fizzled, helping only a few percent of patients with melanoma or kidney cancer.Dr. Rosenberg then tried to surgically remove tumors and extract the T-cells that had already penetrated them, so-called tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. He multiplied those cells in the lab and infused them back in the patient, along with shots of IL-2. He limited his focus to melanoma, the skin cancer that seemed most susceptible to immune attack.The treatment eventually achieved remissions in about 10 percent to 25 percent of patients. But it was labor-intensive and its application to other cancers unclear.There had to be a better way. Indeed, one approach was taking shape across the street from Dr. Rosenberg, at the Naval Medical Research Institute in Bethesda.The Navy was not Carl June\u2019s desired career choice. Accepted at Stanford in 1971, he instead chose the Naval Academy to avoid the draft and Vietnam. The Navy sent him to medical school and for training in bone-marrow transplantation, geared toward treating people irradiated by nuclear weapons.When the Cold War ended, the Navy lost interest.Dr. June turned to working with T-cells at the Naval Medical Research Institute in the mid-1980s. He and a colleague, Dr. Bruce Levine, found a way to multiply T-cells in huge numbers outside the body, a method still used today. And in the mid-1990s, working with Cell Genesys, a gene therapy company, Dr. June began trying to genetically modify patients\u2019 T-cells to kill H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS.But when his wife, Cindy, the mother of the couple\u2019s three children, developed ovarian cancer in 1996, Dr. June\u2019s research turned personal.Dr. June had tried everything to save her, including the primitive immune therapies under development. But Ms. June died in 2001.\u201cA lot of other scientists would have been disillusioned by the failure, in his case the personal tragedy,\u201d said Sean Parker, the internet billionaire who is funding some of Dr. June\u2019s work.Instead, Dr. June, who had moved to the University of Pennsylvania, stopped treating patients, and devoted himself to creating cell therapies for cancer.\u201cThings that were back burner on cell therapy became front burner,\u201d he said.In the 1980s, scientists began experimenting with gene therapy, putting new genes into cells of the body to treat disease. Michel Sadelain, while still a graduate student studying immunology at the University of Alberta, told colleagues that he thought the technique could be used to supercharge T-cells to fight cancer.\u201cAt the time it sounded very pipe dream,\u201d said Douglas Green, who was one of Dr. Sadelain\u2019s doctoral thesis advisers and is now chairman of immunology at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital.But Dr. Sadelain, he continued, \u201cbelieved in his approach and he pursued it relentlessly.\u201dAfter earning his Ph.D., Dr. Sadelain headed for the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Mass., to learn how to do gene therapy, using disabled viruses that could not cause disease to deliver genes into cells. By 1992, he had demonstrated that he could genetically engineer mouse T-cells.He then moved to Sloan Kettering. In 2003, he and his colleagues \u2014 including his partner and now wife, Isabelle Rivi\u00e8re \u2014 showed that genetically engineered T-cells could eradicate certain cancers in mice.How is this done? To fight cancer, T-cells have to recognize cancerous cells.Each T-cell in the body has unique receptors, sort of like claws that jut out from its surface. T-cells patrol the body looking for protein fragments that indicate a cell might be infected by a bacterium or virus. If one of its claws latches on to such a fragment, the T-cell destroys the cell displaying it.But cancer cells are mutated versions of the body\u2019s own cells, not outsiders. T-cells do not always recognize them as something to kill.So scientists like Dr. Sadelain decided to put a new claw on the T-cells, one that could recognize cancer by latching on to a telltale protein on cancer cells.The new claws came from another part of the immune system known as antibodies. Drug companies already knew how to make antibodies with claws that bind to specific proteins in the body.But the claw was not enough. Once a claw binds to a target protein, it needs a molecule to signal the T-cell to go into killing mode. Yet another signal helps sustain the killing. The DNA instructions for all three components are inserted into the patient\u2019s T-cells.Since this concoction is part antibody and part T-cell, it is a chimera, like the monster of Greek mythology that is part lion, part goat and part serpent. The claw is called a receptor and the protein it binds to on the cancer cell, the target, is called an antigen. So the whole construct is called a chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, and the use of it to treat cancer is called CAR T-cell therapy, or CAR-T.Dr. Sadelain was not alone in this work. Zelig Eshhar, an Israeli scientist, is credited with developing one of the first crude CARs around 1989. Dr. Rosenberg, always on the lookout for new types of immunotherapy, invited Dr. Eshhar to be a visiting scientist in his laboratory at the National Cancer Institute.Another early developer was Dr. Dario Campana of St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital.As scientists worked to perfect the formula in the 1990s and early 2000s, there was quite a bit of sharing. Cancer cell therapy was still mostly an academic exercise; it was highly uncertain whether it would ever really work.Dr. June, after hearing a presentation by Dr. Campana at a conference in 2003, requested a sample of Dr. Campana\u2019s CAR. Dr. Sadelain shared his design with both Dr. June and Dr. Rosenberg. The most prominent CAR developed at the National Cancer Institute owes a lot to Dr. Sadelain, Dr. Rosenberg said.But the science proved difficult and the research money scarce. Pharmaceutical companies showed little interest, preferring mass-produced drugs, one size fits all, rather than a treatment that would be made separately for each patient.Again, a death from cancer propelled the field forward. In 2001, a 44-year-old woman, Kimberly Lawrence Netter, succumbed to breast cancer. Her father-in-law, Edward Netter, a wealthy financial services entrepreneur, and his wife, Barbara, formed the nonprofit Alliance for Cancer Gene Therapy, which issued some of its first grants to Dr. June and Dr. Sadelain. Dr. June also got support from the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.\u201cWithout that,\u201d Dr. June said of the charities, \u201cwe would not have had a clinical trial.\u201dAs the first decade of this century neared its end, the three pioneers were ready for the big moment \u2014 testing their treatments in patients. They scrambled to be the first to announce peer-reviewed results.Dr. Rosenberg and colleagues published first, in the journal Blood in 2010. They described a single patient with lymphoma whose tumors shrank after treatment. (The patient later received more therapy, and has been free of cancer since.)But the approach really attracted attention the next year when Dr. June reported that two of three patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia went into complete remission.One of them, Doug Olson, a chemist from Tinicum Township, Pa., left the hospital and immediately bought a sailboat. He also took to running half-marathons.\u201cIt was like this weight that had been sitting there was gone,\u201d said Mr. Olson, who is free of cancer nearly six years later.Bill Ludwig, a retired captain in the New Jersey Department of Corrections, had already paid for his funeral when he started treatment in August 2010. Once his genetically engineered T-cells were unleashed in his system, Mr. Ludwig\u2019s lungs started to fail, his legs ballooned to twice their size, his blood pressure dropped and he began hallucinating.When he emerged from the ordeal, doctors searched for cancer. Detecting none, they ordered another test, certain of error. But there was no mistake. Five pounds of tumor had been destroyed.Mr. Ludwig, now 71, and his wife bought an R.V. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make up for lost time,\u201d he said. He has celebrated the high school graduations of five grandchildren and welcomed his first great-grandchild.As for Dr. June, Mr. Ludwig said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe someone who basically saved your life. He lost the one he loved, and turned around and saved me years later.\u201dThe 2011 publication of Dr. June\u2019s results transformed the field.Novartis, the big Swiss pharmaceutical company, licensed the rights to the therapies created in Dr. June\u2019s lab at the University of Pennsylvania, throwing aside concerns that treatments manufactured for individual patients would not be good business. That set off a commercial rush, flooding the field with cash after years of doubt.While various companies are in pursuit, three are in the lead. They hope to win approval from the Food and Drug Administration to bring the first CAR treatments to market as early as 2017 or 2018, although it is not yet clear how easy it will be to get regulatory approval for such a novel therapy.The companies are teamed with academic pioneers: Novartis with Penn; Kite Pharma with the National Cancer Institute; and Juno Therapeutics with Sloan Kettering, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital.Somewhat predictably, success provoked jostling and envy. Rather than being allies against a disbelieving world, the pioneers now had something worth fighting over \u2014 credit, and the gleam of a possible Nobel Prize.While the Sloan Kettering researchers had done some of the early genetic engineering, they did not publish strong results in five patients until 2013. By then, they had been scooped by Dr. Rosenberg with one patient and Dr. June with three.St. Jude sued the University of Pennsylvania. Novartis sided with Penn, and Juno Therapeutics with St. Jude.Patrick M. Coughlin, who teaches anatomy at the Commonwealth Medical College in Scranton, Pa., now explains the immune system to his classes by telling how one man overcame cancer. Only gradually does it become clear that he is referring to himself.Now 63, Mr. Coughlin noticed a mass the size of a softball in his abdomen in summer 2013. It was a form of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. Three different types of chemotherapy and a bone-marrow transplant all failed to help him. Desperate, he came to the National Institutes of Health campus here last year for the cell therapy developed by Dr. Rosenberg\u2019s team.The battle between Mr. Coughlin\u2019s genetically engineered immune cells and the cancer was brutal. For four days he had a fever as high as 105, chills and bed-soaking sweats. Even his brain malfunctioned \u2014 at one point he could not count to 10 or write his wife\u2019s name.But when the battle ended, the cancer was no longer there. \u201cIf I had gotten this thing five years ago,\u201d he said of his disease, \u201cI\u2019d be dead.\u201dYet for all the excitement, there are reasons for caution. The CAR therapy works now only for patients with some B-cell lymphomas and leukemias, which account for only about 80,000 of the 1.7 million cases of cancer diagnosed in the United States each year. It has not been successfully used to treat malignancies of the lungs, breast, prostate, colon or other organs.\u201cThe solid tumors that kill over 90 percent of people do not respond to anything we have now,\u201d Dr. Rosenberg said.Because it is personalized, cell therapy is likely to be frightfully expensive \u2014 probably hundreds of thousands of dollars per patient, though the companies bringing these treatments to market have not yet said how much they would charge.Producing the re-engineered cells is lengthy and complex. Some patients have died during the two to four weeks it took to genetically modify and multiply their cells.And the therapy itself can be arduous. First, patients get chemotherapy to wipe out many of their existing T-cells to make room for the engineered ones. Once those enter the body, they can set off a ferocious immune response as well as temporary neurological problems like memory loss, seizures and hallucinations.Recently Juno Therapeutics had to temporarily halt its clinical trial after three patients died from brain swelling. The problem arose when the company added a second chemotherapy drug to the regimen preparing the patients for the cell infusion. The authorities allowed the trial to resume without that chemotherapy drug.Still, some patients find themselves hoping they get violently ill, since that is a sign the treatment is working.\u201cEvery morning my wife would ask me how I\u2019m feeling,\u201d said Myles Stiefvater, a copier salesman from Newark, Del., who had the treatment in 2014. When he said he felt O.K., they were disappointed.Researchers are also finding, to their dismay, that remissions do not always last. The therapy has had its biggest success in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, producing complete remissions for 60 percent to more than 90 percent of patients. Yet up to half of those patients eventually suffer a relapse.In some cases, the tumor evolves so that it no longer displays on its surface what the claw binds to, making it invisible to the engineered cells. In other cases, the engineered cells might not last long enough in the body, giving the cancer a chance to resurge.Karen Shollenberger, a student at Drexel University with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, thought she was in the clear after being in remission for nine months after a CAR-T treatment.But in September, as the school year was beginning, the cancer returned.She entered a new trial testing a new CAR therapy directed at another protein on B-cells. Again the cancer went into remission, and she returned to school.But fear lurked in her: What if the new therapy also stopped working? That indeed happened recently. Her best hope now is a bone-marrow transplant.\u201cEach relapse is increasingly terrifying as the options continue to shrink,\u201d said Ms. Shollenberger, 22. But, she said, the cell therapies have given her nearly two good years.The big thrust now is to expand the use of cell therapy to additional types of cancer.The key is to find protein targets that the engineered T-cells can latch on to to kill cancer cells. Ideally, such a protein should be on all the tumor cells, so the entire cancer would be eradicated. But it should not be on healthy cells, or they would also be destroyed, causing side effects.\u201cT-cells are very powerful,\u201d said Dr. Campana, formerly of St. Jude and now at the National University of Singapore. \u201cIn the same way they can eliminate cancer, they can also kill you.\u201dA protein called HER2, for instance, is found on many breast and other tumors, making it a seemingly good target. But it is also found in tiny amounts in the lungs. When Dr. Rosenberg\u2019s team infused killer T-cells aimed at HER2 into a patient, she went into respiratory distress within 15 minutes and died five days later.The treatments work for the blood cancers because there is a good target. But finding these for the most common cancers has been difficult.One problem is that CARs, because of how they are made, can bind only to proteins on the surface of cancer cells. But most proteins made by these cells, or by any cell for that matter, are inside the cell, out of reach.There is an alternative approach that is gaining interest. Patients\u2019 immune cells can be engineered to make what are called T-cell receptors, or TCRs. These can recognize proteins inside the cancer cells.Some experts say TCRs, which have a far wider array of potential targets, represent the best hope of using cell therapy to treat solid tumors. There have been hints of effectiveness already in treating one of those, a type of sarcoma.It might turn out that the best target for each patient will be unique to that person. Scientists are now experimenting with using DNA sequencing and other techniques to find the best mutated protein in each person\u2019s tumor at which to aim the claw.\u201cThink of how dauntingly personalized this is,\u201d Dr. Rosenberg said. \u201cWe are using their own cells to treat a unique mutation in their own tumor.\u201dHe said this approach might allow cell therapy to be used for most patients.Many other improvements are on the runway.Dr. Sadelain and Juno are working on \u201carmored CARs\u201d that not only bind to the target but produce immune-stimulating chemicals. Cellectis, a French company, has treated two babies with an off-the-shelf CAR treatment that does not require each patient\u2019s cells to be processed. Bellicum Pharmaceuticals is working on genetic switches that dim or shut off the CAR if the treatment is endangering the patient.\u201cWe\u2019re in the Model T version of the CAR now,\u201d said Dr. Levine, now the director of the cell production facility at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cWhat\u2019s coming along are Google CARs and Tesla CARs.\u201dIn February, the Novartis-Penn Center for Advanced Cellular Therapeutics opened on the ninth floor of a Penn medical building, paid for mainly by $20 million from Novartis. It has gleaming new laboratory space, clean rooms with the capacity to manufacture therapy for 400 patients a year, and a great view of downtown Philadelphia. On the wall are photographs of patients with success stories, like Doug Olson running a half-marathon and, of course, Emily Whitehead.Dr. June, who remarried and had two more children, now jets off regularly to attend conferences and give talks. A world map hanging outside his office is titled \u201cWhere in the World Is Carl June?\u201d It has pins stuck in every location he has been, and a picture of him on a bicycle pinned to his location at the moment.In the last two years he has visited more than 150 cities in more than 20 countries. This year alone he has accumulated more than 200,000 airline miles. Despite that schedule, he runs ultramarathons and participated in July in the Death Ride, a grueling bicycle race in California.Dr. Rosenberg still arrives at the National Cancer Institute nearly seven days a week. The walls outside his office are covered with signed photographs of the hundreds of fellows who have trained under him, many of them now leaders in immunotherapy. Every five years, they gather for a reunion, to reminisce and honor their mentor.Arie Belldegrun, who was a fellow in the 1980s, now runs Kite, the company commercializing the National Cancer Institute\u2019s CAR technology. He recounted what happened when he tried to get Dr. Rosenberg to join the company.\u201cHe sits quietly, quietly, quietly, and then he asks, \u2018Arie, why don\u2019t you ask me what I want to do?\u2019\u201cHe said: \u2018Every day that I go to work, I\u2019m as excited as a kid coming to a new place for the first time. If you ask me what I want to do, I want to die on this desk one day.\u2019\u201dBut not before he conquers cancer.\u201cI want to end this holocaust,\u201d Dr. Rosenberg said in the interview. \u201cI think I\u2019m finally getting the hang of what it will take to widely apply this to cancers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Want an All-Access Pass to the Rio Olympics? Being Royalty Helps.", "Date": "2016-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 His Royal Highness Tunku Imran of Malaysia was sitting in the media center at the badminton arena recently, holding his Olympic credential with both hands. To untrained eyes, it looked like little more than a piece of laminated paper. But the prince\u2019s eyes are anything but untrained.\u201cAccreditation is everything at the Olympics,\u201d he said, \u201cand this is the best one.\u201dSo, it\u2019s as good as gold here?\u201cNo,\u201d he said, offering a polite correction. \u201cIt\u2019s platinum.\u201dLong before the opening ceremony, a very different Olympic competition had already unfolded. It was a contest for access, privilege and prestige, and the results hang like a plastic medal around the necks of thousands of participants here, everyone from athletes and coaches to reporters and a wide array of officials.These credentials are much more than a ticket to an event. These are passes to restricted areas, which might include special seats, better transportation and even entry to the Olympic Village, where athletes are housed.\u201cLiterally, he can go anywhere he wants,\u201d said Dato\u2019 Low Beng Choo, a Malaysian Olympic official who was sitting next to the prince.For the vast majority of people, credentials at the Games are simply a way to get to places you need to be \u2014 the volleyball venue, in the case of a volleyball player, or the press center, in the case of a broadcast journalist. For a rarefied group, though, credentials are where the Olympics become a little bit like the military and a little bit like high school. They reflect status, in gradations too numerous to count.At the top of this pyramid is a group known as the \u201cOlympic Family,\u201d which is not, as it may sound, the relatives of athletes. Rather, it is the members of the various committees and associations that plan, organize and orchestrate the Games.Members of the Olympic Family have separate entrances to events, as well as their own Olympic Family Lounges, which are cordoned-off dens scattered around the Games. Those with the proper mark on their credential \u2014 \u201c6,\u201d as it happens \u2014 can avail themselves of food and comfy sofas.Even within the Olympic Family there are different levels of eminence. Bestriding them all are the roughly 100 members of the International Olympic Committee. Yes, one of them was arrested Wednesday for purportedly selling a few million dollars\u2019 worth of event tickets. But for now, and long after that scandal subsides, I.O.C. members are the pashas of the Games. Their perks include the little-known Olympic Club, which, Prince Imran said, is near the swimming venue.\u201cThey give you a gold card, and you can go anytime you like,\u201d he said. \u201cYou also get two guest passes. Which means you can bring two guests, once. I\u2019ve already used my two guest passes, for my wife and my son. But you can make an application to the I.O.C. and request more.\u201dReviews of the club are mixed. Karl Stoss, an Austrian casino and lottery executive who was elected to the I.O.C. while in Rio, was underwhelmed.\u201cNo atmosphere,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like an airport lounge, but less crowded.\u201d\u201cWe stayed for about 20 minutes and left,\u201d said his friend Peter Mennel, who runs Austria\u2019s National Olympic Committee, making him gold-card eligible.The ultimate I.O.C. perk \u2014 at least theoretically \u2014 is an assigned car and driver. (\u201cT1\u201d on the credential.) This is a slight upgrade from \u201cT3,\u201d which is the right to hop into any car in a fleet ready to chauffeur eligible riders. Each car comes with an O.F.A., an Olympic family assistant, who is supposed to help with interpreting.T1 and T3 cars can drive on recently opened highways and roads, more than 150 miles of pavement that were poured for the Games. They will have an afterlife for residents of Rio, but for now, these are just for properly credentialed cars and buses.See the Summer Games in a series of composite images.This has infuriated locals, who have been forced to cope with worse-than-usual traffic snarls. But remarkably, the system does not seem to have eased much of the friction for its beneficiaries.Prince Imran, for instance, said that his T1 driver had gotten so lost on his way to the women\u2019s rugby sevens final that he caught only the last few minutes of the game. For the men\u2019s final, he tried a minibus, though he had an equally truncated experience.\u201cBoth times, the drivers were unable to find the stadium,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of the roads are new, so Google Maps often doesn\u2019t help. And they need better signage, though I think some of the drivers don\u2019t read the signs. So it\u2019s been a challenge. I think the Brazilians are doing their best. Maybe not enough training, you know.\u201dThe patrician scent wafting from this barely visible dimension of the Games has its origins in the man who all but created the modern Olympics.\u201cIf we step back, the Games were founded by a plucky aristocrat named Pierre de Coubertin, and he assembled dukes and princes to form the International Olympic Committee,\u201d said Jules Boykoff, author of \u201cPower Games: A Political History of the Olympics.\u201d \u201cThe movement has its roots in power and privilege. It has changed mightily over the years and 1981 admitted the first woman into this boys\u2019 club. But it still has an inordinate amount of sheikhs and princes.\u201dAlong with all of these benefits come obligations. Many of the medals are awarded by I.O.C. members, and the prince was scheduled for a ceremony later that day at the velodrome, home of the cycling events.\u201cI\u2019ve done two, and I\u2019m scheduled to do two more,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor for your country.\u201dThen there is the hobnobbing. The 2012 Olympics were called \u201ca gigantic schmoozathon\u201d by Boris Johnson, the mayor of London at the time. For someone like Prince Imran, the Games are a tightly packed schedule of very good meals. There is no mark on his credential for this particular upside. It just comes with the job \u2014 like it or not.\u201cTonight we have dinner at the China House,\u201d he said, referring to the Olympic hosting venue built by the Chinese. \u201cThe invite came last week, and they asked, Which night would you like to come? That\u2019s almost cornering us.\u201dAdvertisement"}

You can even turn and angle your face or smile just as you would if you were applying real makeup in a mirror.Then the app applies digital makeup, which you choose from a dial-like interface. The options include the ability to choose hairstyles and colors. And if the look of, for example, the artificial eyeliner is not right, you can fine-tune the shape of each effect.Unlike its peers, YouCam includes special features like party makeup looks and the chance to add accessories like earrings.

{"Headline": "Even Uber Couldn\u2019t Bridge the China Divide", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtTravis Kalanick, the co-founder and chief executive of the ride-hailing giant Uber, often defended his eagerness to risk billions on winning the Chinese market with a simple question: If you have a chance to become Amazon and Alibaba at the same time, why not try?The implication was simple. Over the last couple of decades, Amazon, Facebook, Google and other American technology giants have each followed a similar script for world domination. Like an imperial armada rolling out from North America\u2019s West Coast, these companies would try to establish beachheads on every other continent.But when American giants tried to enter the waters of China, the world\u2019s largest internet market, the armada invariably ran aground.Plagued by opaque and ever-shifting regulations and a culturally abstruse way of doing business, American companies fell to a series of local giants. Instead of Google, Baidu. Instead of Facebook, WeChat, owned by the giant Tencent. And instead of Amazon, Alibaba.That has left us with a divide: Today, there is the Chinese internet, and there is the internet of the rest of the world. A network seen in its early days as a tool to foster financial and political unity across a fragmented planet has irrevocably cleaved into two completely separate spheres.Entrepreneurs across the globe can choose to win in China or the rest of the world. You can be Alibaba or you can be Amazon. You can be Uber or you can be Didi. But you can\u2019t be both. Given the rising Chinese market and increasing tension over the role of American tech firms in the rest of the globe, the gulf between the two sides promises to become one of the most important factors in determining the shape of global tech innovation.How exactly might the war play out? In some ways, being at the mercy of two poles of internet leadership could be good for citizens of planet Earth. In emerging markets like India, the Middle East and parts of Africa and South America, the giants of China and the United States are increasingly investing billions to compete for local customers in e-commerce, social networking, ride sharing and other markets.\u201cAmazon is increasingly making its own branded products, taking on Procter & Gamble and others, and also getting into the logistics business, and shipping, and everything else,\u201d Mr. Clark said. \u201cBut Alibaba is a marketplace that doesn\u2019t hold inventory and describes themselves as helping local merchants \u2014 so maybe there\u2019s some argument that Alibaba could serve as a counter globally to Amazon.\u201d\u201cIn that way it could be like the Yalta Conference,\u201d said Mr. Clark, referring to the 1945 meeting in which the victors of World War II determined the postwar geopolitical order.\u201cThe barrels that will be thrown at you when you\u2019re trying to do business in China will just never stop,\u201d said Mark Natkin, the managing director of Marbridge Consulting, an advisory firm based in Beijing. \u201cYou\u2019ll constantly be above one barrel or recovering from jumping one, and as you\u2019re dusting yourself off you look down the road and here comes the next one.\u201dCompared with previous failures, Uber seemed to do everything right in China. It set up a separate company, Uber China, which had a buy-in from local investors, including from a local giant, Baidu. It hired many local experts, and worked closely with the national government to foster friendly relations.Insiders say Mr. Kalanick was also personally invested in the deal. He visited China eight times in the last year and a half, and became something of a tech star in the Chinese media.Publicly Mr. Kalanick had insisted he was fighting for total victory in China. But he must have known that Uber would always struggle to achieve dominance, given the emerging centrality of ride-sharing to the future of infrastructure in China. Still, even if he failed to win everything in China, investing early in the country seemed too big to skip.For now, it\u2019s especially delicious frosting. The $2 billion Uber spent tackling China is now worth about $7 billion in the new merged entity; if Didi does become one of China\u2019s largest tech companies, the value of Uber\u2019s stake in China could rise geometrically, making the firm much more attractive in a potential initial public offering. Pulling out of China also frees up Uber to invest more in other markets \u2014 India and Indonesia are big targets \u2014 as well as expand its expertise in core technological initiatives like mapping data and self-driving cars.But if spending big to tackle China ultimately works out for Uber, it will be an anomaly, and certainly not a model for other American tech giants.\u201cThe ride-sharing market is one the few markets where the upside is big enough to justify going in,\u201d Mr. Thompson said. \u201cFor most other companies, going into China is still going to be nothing but pain.\u201dEmail: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Becomes a Green Energy Supplier, With Itself as Customer", "Date": "2016-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 The words are stenciled on the front of the Apple Store, a glass box sandwiched between a nondescript Thai restaurant and a CVS pharmacy in downtown Palo Alto: \u201cThis store runs on 100 percent renewable energy.\u201dIf Apple\u2019s plans play out, it will be able to make that claim not only for its operations throughout California but also beyond, as the company aims to meet its growing needs for electricity with green sources like solar, wind and hydroelectric power.Like other big companies before it, including Walmart and Google, Apple recently received a federal designation for its energy subsidiary that allows it to become a wholesale seller of electricity from coast to coast. In effect, Apple is creating its own green utility company, although the main customer is itself.The motives may be economic as much as they are environmental. As a wholesaler, Apple could reduce the cost of its electricity load, which reached 831 million kilowatt-hours in the last fiscal year \u2014 enough to power about 76,000 homes for a year. But like a growing number of corporations, Apple is intent on reducing carbon dioxide emissions from electricity production \u2014 one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.In one ambitious venture, Apple has contracted with First Solar to begin buying a little less than half of the power later this year from California Flats, a solar energy farm now under construction. Under the terms of the deal, Apple will pay $848 million for the electricity over 25 years and receive the farm\u2019s total output by the end of the agreement. It is one of largest commercial clean energy contracts yet.Lisa Jackson, the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency who is now the Apple executive overseeing environmental policy, social initiatives and worldwide government affairs, said she hoped Apple could serve as a model for the many other big corporate power users that are now embracing clean energy.\u201cThis is just another sort of innovative way to get that power onto the grid so we don\u2019t have to take the California grid-mix default, which still includes fossil fuel,\u201d Ms. Jackson said.Although much of Apple\u2019s manufacturing is done offshore, it still has extensive needs for electric power in the United States \u2014 and not only for the sprawling new corporate campus it is building at its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., and its 270 retail stores around the country.One of Apple\u2019s biggest demands for electricity comes from operating the computing cloud through which it sells apps, music and videos to users of its iPhones, iPads and Mac computers.Apple\u2019s move comes as prices for renewable energy continue to plummet. And signing long-term contracts allows businesses to shield themselves from potentially higher, more volatile charges from a power company. Apple would not say how much it was paying for California Flats\u2019s energy, but Ms. Jackson said last year at a Wall Street Journal conference that it was less than what it paid for commercial power. She said she expected the company to save hundreds of millions of dollars over the life of the contract.Google, which received its federal energy wholesale designation from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 2010, is a big proponent of the approach Apple is now taking.\u201cRunning any kind of business, having predictability in terms of your operating costs can be very important,\u201d said Gary Demasi, director of operations for data center energy and location strategy at Google, which has been a leading investor in and user of clean energy. \u201cRenewable energy, from a cost perspective, is now competitive with other forms of energy, much more so than it was a few years ago.\u201dExecutives face greater pressure from shareholders and customers to show that they are doing their part to fight climate change. At the same time, corporate energy use has exploded, driven in many cases by the ravenous demands of the data cloud.\u201cWe are all becoming very large energy players, and this is a shift,\u201d said Brian Janous, director of energy strategy at Microsoft. \u201cEnergy is not something that Microsoft or Amazon or Google really ever had to think much about prior to the advent of the cloud.\u201dElectric utilities have begun to respond by creating products and services to meet the corporate demand for clean energy, said Letha Tawney, the World Resources Institute\u2019s director of utility innovation.One such product is a green tariff. It was pioneered in North Carolina by Duke Energy and is now under consideration in about a dozen states. It allows companies to designate that they are paying for a renewable energy supply.Another is a synthetic or virtual power purchase agreement, under which companies contract to buy the output of a clean power plant, as Apple is doing with California Flats.Although the companies say these arrangements mean they are running their businesses on renewable energy, in reality the clean power often does not flow directly to their facilities. They typically buy the renewable energy in amounts to match what they draw from the grid \u2014 a system of swaps that Ms. Jackson of Apple likened to using an A.T.M.\u201cThe dollar you deposit in the bank might not be the exact same bill that you get out,\u201d she said.Robert F. Shapiro, a partner at the law firm Chadbourne & Parke who focuses on project finance and energy, describes it as meaningful symbolism.\u201cThey\u2019re actually getting power from their local utility, which may be coal,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cBut they\u2019re deemed to have put into the world carbon-neutral energy, which they are deemed to have used for their load.\u201dTo keep track of the clean energy credits, power generators work with registries to issue numbered certificates.\u201cThe power flows into the grid. The electrons go where they go,\u201d Ms. Tawney said. \u201cBut because there\u2019s a renewable-energy certificate, no one else can claim the same zero-carbon benefit.\u201dSuch complexities are necessary, executives and clean energy advocates say, because it is not often feasible to install enough renewable-power generators at corporate sites to meet companies\u2019 full energy needs.Walmart, despite having installed solar panels, wind turbines and fuel cells at stores and distribution centers, can nonetheless meet only about a third of those operations\u2019 energy needs. So it also buys renewable energy from generators and utilities, said David Ozment, director of energy at Walmart stores.Procter & Gamble, another member of the energy buyers\u2019 alliance, has arranged to purchase all of the steam from a biomass generator under construction at a plant in Georgia where it makes Charmin toilet paper and Bounty paper towels, said Jack McAneny, the company\u2019s director of sustainability.But that was possible, he said, only because of the plant\u2019s location near a source of waste wood and pulp for fuel and the cooperation of P&G\u2019s partners. Among those partners are the local utility, Georgia Power, which will buy the electricity from the generator for its customers from Constellation, the company that developed and will own and operate the generator.At Apple, where the purchase or production of renewable energy has more than tripled since 2012, the company would prefer to not have to go to great lengths to ensure a clean energy supply, Ms. Jackson said. But the public energy grid is simply still too dependent on carbon-based fuels to make that possible.\u201cIf we had our preference, we\u2019d just be able to say, \u2018We want 100 percent green power everywhere we use power,\u2019\u201d Ms. Jackson said. \u201cThe best would be if we could run every one of our stores, every one of our data centers, every office complex, every building we have, on 100 percent renewable \u2014 and if we didn\u2019t have to spend a whole bunch of our time and energy figuring out how to get that done.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Brenda Hwang, a friend of the couple who became a Universal Life minister for the event, officiated.Ms. Brooks, 28, is keeping her name. She is an associate specializing in retail law at Sedgwick, a law firm based in San Francisco. She graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, and received her law degree cum laude from the University of Michigan. She is a daughter of Kay U. Brooks of Granite Bay, Calif., and Albert L. Brooks of Roseville, Calif.The groom, 29, is an associate at Exponent, an engineering and scientific consulting firm in Menlo Park, Calif. He also graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, and received a Ph.D. in materials science and engineering from the University of Michigan. He is a son of Karin Kimiecik and Kenneth Kimiecik Jr. of Santa Clara, Calif.In July 2010, Ms. Brooks began a solo backpacking journey that started in Arica, in northern Chile, where she was living with a Chilean family and volunteering as an English teacher at a local high school through a program offered by the Chilean Ministry of Education.While in Chile she also began filing online applications to various law schools in the United States. By the time her backpacking adventure took her to Nicaragua in January 2011, she was starting to hear back from various schools, and would travel to town once a week to look over her responses at an internet cafe.By March, still in Nicaragua, she intensified her research on individual schools. But she found limited success getting individuals to send her feedback through postings she made Google and a travel website called Couchsurfing.com.So she eventually hatched a plan to connect with both male and female students living in the college towns she was targeting: She figured that those she contacted through OkCupid would be more motivated to respond.\u201cIt was a pretty good way to see what the people who could tell me about life at these schools were all about,\u201d she said. \u201cThe site was also free of charge, so I didn\u2019t have to spend any money.\u201dShe said that she was not interested in finding romance, which is why Ms. Brooks did not initially put her photo on the dating site. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t getting much feedback that way,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I eventually decided to use a photo of myself.\u201dWhen she began researching the University of Michigan, she filtered her search for current graduate students in Ann Arbor, which resulted in a 99 percent match with a guy whose profile obscured his face but who was clearly wearing a shirt from U.C. Berkeley, Ms. Brooks\u2019s alma mater.\u201cI thought it was a pretty darn clever idea,\u201d said Mr. Kimiecik, the mystery man in the shirt. \u201cI figured this is a person I should definitely help out.\u201dSo they began corresponding and became online friends.\u201cHe seemed like a pretty cool person, someone I looked forward to talking to,\u201d said Ms. Brooks, whose interactions with University of Michigan-based Mr. Kimiecik, eventually helped her choose to study law there. \u201cHe seemed warm and kind, but I didn\u2019t know what he looked like because all the photos of him were old and taken at odd angles. It was hard to see his face.\u201dA month later, Ms. Brooks returned from Nicaragua to her mother\u2019s home in Granite Bay to prepare for law school. Her online exchanges with Mr. Kimiecik were now replaced by phone calls and texting, \u201cand a little bit of flirting,\u201d according to Ms. Brooks.The more they flirted, the more he grew interested.\u201cShe was charming and intelligent,\u201d he said. \u201cI also found her to be a warmhearted, positive and perceptive person. I kept wanting to know more and more about her.\u201dDespite their regular communications, Ms. Brooks still did not know what Mr. Kimiecik looked like, so she asked him to post a more-recent photo. He replied by sending her a photo of himself wearing ski goggles and a ski jacket, which had a hood covering most of his face.\u201cI thought it was hilarious,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I also found it wildly frustrating.\u201dThough he explained the stunt as \u201ca partial joke,\u201d he added, \u201cMy usual reaction to first meeting someone is to keep them at arm\u2019s length before I start telling them my whole life story.\u201dShe finally got the chance to see him up close when she flew to Michigan, and he picked her up at the airport. Before meeting him at the baggage claim area, she rushed to the bathroom to apply some makeup.\u201cI didn\u2019t put stock in anything, but I was hopeful and I wanted to make a good first impression,\u201d she said.Like the kind of first impression Mr. Kimiecik made on her.\u201cHe was incredibly handsome,\u201d she said. \u201cI was excited to finally be standing next to him.\u201dThey were soon dating and began living together in August 2012. In July 2013, he proposed to her at Point Reyes National Seashore in California, and when she returned to Granite Bay in February 2014 to begin studying for the bar exam, a 19-month long-distance relationship ensued.They were reunited in September 2015, when Mr. Kimiecik, who had earned his Ph.D., went to San Francisco to join Ms. Brooks, who was already working at Sedgwick.\u201cOur long-distance relationship was reaffirming for me,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought back to all of those times I was on my own and didn\u2019t need him, but now I was on my own again, and this time I wanted to be with him.

And the automaker announced investments in three other companies involved in major technologies for driverless vehicles.For several years, automakers have understood that their industry is being reshaped by the use of advanced computer chips, software and sensors to develop cars designed to drive themselves. The tech companies Google and Apple have emerged as potential future competitors to automakers, while Tesla Motors has already proved a competitive threat to luxury brands like BMW and Mercedes-Benz with driver-assistance and collision-avoidance technologies.More recently, ride-sharing service providers like Uber have raised the competitive concerns of the conventional auto industry. The ride-hailing services aim to operate fleets of driverless cars that, in the future, might provide ready transportation to anyone, making it easier for people to get around without owning a car or even having a driver\u2019s license.A Barclays analyst, Brian Johnson, recently predicted that once autonomous vehicles are in widespread use, auto sales could fall as much as 40 percent as people rely on such services for transportation and choose not to own cars.Mr. Fields said on Tuesday that the combination of driverless cars and ride-sharing services represented a \u201cseismic shift\u201d for the auto industry that would be greater than the advent of the moving production line was roughly a century ago.\u201cThe world is changing, and it\u2019s changing rapidly,\u201d he said, adding that Ford now sees itself as not just a carmaker but a \u201cmobility company.\u201dBMW and Mercedes-Benz are among the carmakers that have seized upon the concept of \u201ctransportation as a service,\u201d as it is called, by starting ride-sharing services of their own. General Motors has teamed up with, and bought a stake in, Lyft, the main rival of Uber.GM and Lyft plan to have driverless vehicles operating in tests within a year. Initially, at least, those tests will be conducted with a driver in the car to take control from the self-driving technology, if necessary.Even some auto suppliers are focusing on ride-hailing services and driverless cars. This month, the components maker Delphi announced that it was working with the government of Singapore to develop a ride service to shuttle people to and from mass transit stations in the country\u2019s business district.Even though Ford has committed itself to a date for a commercial introduction of its driverless cars, several questions remain about how it will move forward, said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with AutoTrader.For example, Ford does not have a ride-sharing partner as G.M. does in Lyft, Ms. Krebs said.In a research note on Tuesday, Mr. Johnson noted that it remained unclear how auto companies would make money from ride-sharing services.\u201cThese are a lot of promises, but we don\u2019t yet know how they are going to evolve,\u201d Ms. Krebs said. \u201cThere are still missing pieces.\u201dOne of the investments Ford announced on Tuesday was a $75 million stake in Velodyne, which makes sensors that use lidar, a kind of radar based on laser beams. The Chinese internet company Baidu said it was making a comparable investment in Velodyne.Ford also said it had made investments in Nirenberg Neuroscience, which is also developing machine vision technology, and Civil Maps, a start-up that is developing 3D digital maps for use by automated vehicles.

He took over leadership of the team after Sebastian Thrun, the Stanford computer scientist and founder of Google X laboratory, left in 2013.Johnny Luu, a spokesman for Alphabet, the parent company of X, the company\u2019s research division that oversees the car project, confirmed Mr. Urmson was planning to leave.\u201cSeven years ago, the idea that a car could drive itself wasn\u2019t much more than an idea. Chris has been a vital force for the project, helping the team move from a research phase to a point where this lifesaving technology will soon become a reality. He departs with our warmest wishes,\u201d Mr. Luu wrote in an email message.The departures come after Google\u2019s decision last year to hire John Krafcik, the former president and chief executive of Hyundai America, to be chief of the car project, as part of a plan to spin the effort out as a stand-alone company under the Alphabet umbrella.The X research group, often called Google\u2019s \u201cmoonshot\u201d division, is under increasing pressure to show that at some point the company can expect a financial windfall from its projects. Google\u2019s self-driving car project has been a pioneer in autonomous vehicle technology, but a commercial version of the car is still likely to be several years away.Mr. Urmson has been unhappy with the direction of the car project under Mr. Krafcik\u2019s leadership and quarreled privately several months ago with Larry Page over where it was headed, according to two former Google employees. A spokesman for Google declined to comment on those discussions, but Mr. Urmson disputed they were a reason for his departure.After the dispute, Mr. Urmson decided to take the summer off and only recently decided to leave the company. He told members of the self-driving car team about his decision on Thursday, the former employees said.As a researcher at Carnegie Mellon, Mr. Urmson was a member of a team of engineers that placed second in the 2005 Darpa Grand Challenge contest for autonomous vehicles that was won by a rival team from Stanford, led by Mr. Thrun. In 2007, Carnegie Mellon got revenge when it placed first in the Darpa Urban Challenge, while the Stanford team finished second.Earlier this year, a group of Google employees, led by Anthony Levandowski, former Google Car engineer, and Lior Ron, the product lead for Google Maps, left to found the self-driving truck start-up Otto, which is based in San Francisco.More recently, two other Google car engineers, Dave Ferguson and Jiajun Zhu, who are considered experts on so-called machine vision technology, left to found an as-yet-unannounced start-up, according to the two people with knowledge of the Google car project.Advertisement"}

After all, one\u2019s friends tend to share one\u2019s political biases. Facebook likes sharing because it builds loyalty to Facebook.Sharing, to Facebook, is a way that you build your personal brand, a statement of ego that is likely to keep you on the site longer. That is why Facebook\u2019s computers watch what you do on the site. It wants to know what kind of stories to put in front of you, so you will read and share them.On one hand, this is a nice service: You get the kind of news you seem to enjoy reading, which speaks to your worldview. On the other hand, this impedes encountering views unlike yours.Approaching difference with empathy is at the heart of democracy, so the more our own views are endorsed by algorithms, the worse off democracy is. Look no further than the incomprehension and contempt with which many on both sides view each other in the current election season.Of course, this existed long before Facebook. Talk radio and cable news enabled a range of viewpoints, and the biggest networks run programs that endorse a worldview of the right or the left. Direct marketing isolates us too, with lifestyle promises targeted to the people in our ZIP code.Online life took this to a whole new level, with Google-type ad targeting that is as personal as an individual\u2019s search and shopping choices.The latest advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence may compound the problem. These are statistical systems with narrow aims: If it turns out you like something, you\u2019ll get more of it, which you may like and share, ensuring you\u2019ll get more of it.Somebody could build a recommendation engine intended to foster a sympathetic view of others\u2019 lives and values. But don\u2019t count on it. That makes people nervous, and less likely to buy products or share links on Facebook.Advertisement"}

This month, the components maker Delphi announced that it was working with the government of Singapore to develop a ride service to shuttle people to and from mass transit stations in the country\u2019s business district.Even though Ford has committed itself to a date for a commercial introduction of its driverless cars, several questions remain about how it will move forward, said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with AutoTrader.For example, Ford does not have a ride-sharing partner as G.M. does in Lyft, Ms. Krebs said.In a research note on Tuesday, Mr. Johnson noted that it remained unclear how auto companies would make money from ride-sharing services.\u201cThese are a lot of promises, but we don\u2019t yet know how they are going to evolve,\u201d Ms. Krebs said. \u201cThere are still missing pieces.\u201dOne of the investments Ford announced on Tuesday was a $75 million stake in Velodyne, which makes sensors that use lidar, a kind of radar based on laser beams. The Chinese internet company Baidu said it was making a comparable investment in Velodyne.Ford also said it had made investments in Nirenberg Neuroscience, which is also developing machine vision technology, and Civil Maps, a start-up that is developing 3D digital maps for use by automated vehicles. Ford did not disclose the amount it invested in Nirenberg or Civil Maps.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Scientists Just Say No to \u2018Chemtrails\u2019 Conspiracy Theory", "Date": "2016-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byConspiracy theories can be stubborn, particularly in the echo chamber of the internet.One persistent belief in some quarters is that the government \u2014 or business, perhaps \u2014 is deploying a fleet of jet aircraft to spray chemicals into the sky to control the population, food supply or other things.As evidence, they point to what they call \u201cchemtrails,\u201d which are more commonly known as contrails, or condensation trails, produced at high altitudes as water vapor in jet engine exhaust condenses and freezes.Adding fuel to the chemtrails theory is the fact that there are a few legitimate reasons for atmospheric spraying \u2014 \u201cseeding\u201d clouds to make rain, for example \u2014 and in recent years there has been some research on the idea of spraying chemicals as a potential way to fight global warming.The goal, the researchers say, is not so much to change the minds of hard-core believers, but to provide a rebuttal \u2014 the kind that would show up in a Google search \u2014 to persuade other people to steer clear of this idea.Steven J. Davis, a climate scientist at the University of California, Irvine, said he had the idea for the study after a conversation with a salesman at a mattress store.When the man found out what he did for a living, Dr. Davis said, \u201che had very serious questions about what we were going to do about the chemtrails problem.\u201dDr. Davis said that when he got home, he searched the internet for peer-reviewed studies on the conspiracy theory, but found none.The theory has been popularized on websites that display photographs of contrails but are described instead as chemtrails that persist in the atmosphere and contain harmful chemicals like strontium, barium and aluminum.Other evidence cited by these theorists includes documents that are said to be laboratory analyses showing abnormally high levels of these and other chemicals in water and soil samples from areas where spraying is supposed to have taken place.In the study, 77 scientists \u2014 experts in atmospheric chemistry and in the deposition of air pollutants \u2014 were shown some of this evidence and asked whether a chemical spraying program was the simplest explanation for it or whether there were others that were more straightforward.With the photographs, all of the experts chose science over conspiracy theory. For instance, in a photograph of a contrail broken by a gap, chemtrails supporters say the gap is proof the spraying was turned on and off.All of the scientists, however, said there were reasonable scientific explanations for the gap, the most commonly cited being that the aircraft had passed through an area of drier air, which would make that part of the contrail dissipate more quickly.The lab analyses were also dismissed as evidence of a spraying program, although some scientists said there was not enough data to draw any conclusion.And in two cases, an expert thought the analyses might be evidence of spraying. Many of the scientists said that the analyses showed normal, not elevated, levels of the chemicals.The 77 experts were also asked if, in their work or personal life, they had ever seen any evidence for a secret large-scale spraying program. All but one said no.One scientist, who was not identified, said he or she had come across evidence of high levels of barium in the atmosphere in a remote area where soil levels of barium were low.Dr. Davis said it was unclear whether this scientist had concluded that a secret spraying program existed.Mr. West said the new study should help sway people who might otherwise be convinced by a chemtrails website. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to hold back the tide to a certain degree, and hopefully have less people fall into that way of thinking,\u201d he added.Dr. Davis said he viewed this study as the latest effort by scientists to ensure that accurate information is available to counter misinformation from nonscientists.\u201cIt\u2019s incumbent on us as scientists to get scientific perspectives out there,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen with climate change science is that ignoring the deniers hasn\u2019t necessarily been an effective route.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Since then, he\u2019s been bouncing among friends\u2019 apartments and Airbnb rentals.Mr. Altucher is simply practicing what he preaches. Over the last half-decade, this former tech entrepreneur, venture capitalist and financial pundit has reinvented himself as a gimlet-eyed self-help guru, preaching survival in an era when the American Dream \u2014 the gold-embossed college diploma, the corner office, the three-bedroom home \u2014 seems like a sham. So one by one, he has shed all of them.\u201cI have ambition,\u201d he said, \u201cto have no ambition.\u201d\u201cIn the past 25 years, income has gone down for the 18-to-35-year-olds, student loan debt is at an all-time high,\u201d Mr. Altucher said over a lunch of zucchini pancakes at a Russian restaurant in the Flatiron district. \u201cWe had $3 trillion in bailout money, and income inequality got higher than ever. People feel like they were scammed.\u201dMr. Altucher\u2019s diagnosis will come as no surprise to the anxious middle class, the downsized and the dispossessed who have propelled the angry populism of Bernie Sanders and Donald J. Trump.But while there is no shortage of anger and confusion about the supposed waning of the American Dream, what makes Mr. Altucher stand out are his Cassandra-like conclusions.Similarly, he believes homeownership is a rip-off foisted upon unwitting citizens by a $14 trillion mortgage industry.And he think stocks are a racket. It\u2019s a fierce worldview that is rooted in Mr. Altucher\u2019s own roller-coaster life.In the 1990s, as a young Silicon Alley start-up whiz, Mr. Altucher made millions with a web-design company, Reset Inc., that counted Sony and Miramax as clients.Soon, he and his wife at the time, Anne (they divorced in 2010), were living in a 5,000-square-foot loft in TriBeCa that he bought for $1.8 million and spent another $1 million renovating. He felt flush enough to take a helicopter to Atlantic City on weekends to play poker.The lavish lifestyle did not fill his emotional void. \u201cNobody should feel sorry for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI was really stupid, but I thought I was dirt poor. I felt like I needed $100 million to be happy. So I just started investing in all these other companies, and they were just stupid companies. Zero of these investments worked out.\u201dAs his fortunes collapsed, he was forced to sell his apartment for a $1 million loss (it was after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001).\u201cFinancial people were like watching a train wreck in real time,\u201d Mr. Altucher said. \u201cI had friends I hadn\u2019t talked to since high school call me and say, \u2018Hey, are you O.K.?\u2019\u201dHe soon discovered a sizable audience of people whose own dreams had just gone down the sinkhole. They, too, were looking to claw their way out.\u201cThe No. 1 search phrase on Google that takes people to my blog is \u2018I want to die,\u2019\u201d Mr. Altucher said.But Mr. Altucher seems like an unlikely person to look to for solace. Bookish, contrarian and given to speaking in staccato bursts, this skinny computer geek from North Brunswick, N.J., is like the anti-Anthony Robbins, the strapping self-help star.His regular-guy appearance turned out to be a plus, as he developed a following blogging about his win-some-lose-some \u201clife hacker\u201d experiments.It helped that Mr. Altucher, despite his biting views on topics like college, maintained a positive tone. \u201cI am an optimist,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a great novel from the \u201860s by Richard Fari\u00f1a called \u2018Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me.\u2019 Basically, I\u2019ve been down on the floor so many times, I know now that I can always bounce back, and it gets faster each time.\u201dHis philosophy is perhaps most clearly articulated in \u201cChoose Yourself,\u201d which he summarized over lunch like this: \u201cIf you don\u2019t choose the life you want to live, chances are, someone else is going to choose it for you.

{"Headline": "Ursula Le Guin Has Earned a Rare Honor. Just Don\u2019t Call Her a Sci-Fi Writer.", "Date": "2016-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPORTLAND, Ore. \u2014 If you\u2019re a big-deal American writer, you hope for a couple of things to cement your legacy. Finding out one fine October morning that your presence is being requested in Sweden would be ideal. Almost as good is enshrinement in the Library of America, the closest thing to immortality between hardcovers.The Library of America usually restricts itself to Melville, Twain, Hawthorne and the other distinguished dead. But a handful of times it has been so sure of a novelist\u2019s importance that its austere black volumes started appearing while the writer was still alive. Eudora Welty, Saul Bellow and Philip Roth got the call.Ursula K. Le Guin is now on this very shortlist. The library\u2019s original idea was to begin with some of her classic science fiction. But she pressed it to start instead with a volume of her lesser-known work.\u201cThere\u2019s some innate arrogance here: I want to do it my way,\u201d Ms. Le Guin said in an interview at her home here. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be reduced to being \u2018the sci-fi writer.\u2019 People are always trying to push me off the literary scene, and to hell with it.\u201dShe chuckled. \u201cI won\u2019t be pushed.\u201dThe result is that Ms. Le Guin\u2019s \u201cThe Complete Orsinia\u201d is being published on Sept. 6 as Library of America Vol. 281. It includes a little-known novel, \u201cMalafrena,\u201d set in an imaginary Central European country, and 13 related stories. The material spans the first half of Ms. Le Guin\u2019s career, from her first published story in 1961 to 1990.It is definitely not science fiction, and not quite fantasy either. Ms. Le Guin\u2019s more casual fans, she acknowledged, might be surprised by it \u2014 a realistic work set in the early 19th century, a tale of a hopeful revolutionary at a moment when revolutions are impossible.\u201cSomeone who pigeonholed me firmly will say, \u2018What the hell?\u2019 But that\u2019s their problem.\u201dMs. Le Guin is 86. She says \u201cwhat the hell\u201d a lot. She is too old, she says, to get on airplanes or even do events in Portland beyond an occasional bookstore appearance. So the world comes to her \u2014 up a hill, past a sign marked \u201cno outlet,\u201d across a bridge spanning a ravine too deep for trolls.Her 1899 house is shielded by pink, yellow and red roses. In the living room there is a volume of word puzzles on a table and the books Ms. Le Guin and her husband, Charles, a retired historian, are reading aloud at night (\u201cTwo Years Before the Mast\u201d and the poetry of Theodore Roethke). There is not a clue that anyone who lives here is a writer, much less America\u2019s greatest living science fiction writer.This early work was done at the margins of the culture. \u201cA Wizard of Earthsea\u201d (1968), now regarded as one of the great fantasies of the era, was published by a small press in Berkeley, Calif. \u201cThe Left Hand of Darkness\u201d (1969), probably her most influential work, was issued as a 95-cent mass-market paperback.\u201cI published as a genre writer when genre was not literature,\u201d she said. \u201cI paid the price, you could say. Don DeLillo, who comes off as literary without question, takes the award over me\u201d \u2014 at the 1985 National Book Awards \u2014 \u201cbecause I published in genre and he didn\u2019t. Also, he\u2019s a man and I\u2019m a woman.\u201d (Mr. DeLillo won for \u201cWhite Noise\u201d; her book, \u201cAlways Coming Home,\u201d was about a far-future California utopia.)Mellowing with age is clearly not Ms. Le Guin\u2019s style. In 2014, she received the National Book Foundation\u2019s Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters. She spent six months writing her six-minute speech.\u201cWho was I to spit in the publishers\u2019 punch bowl at the annual industry party?\u201d she recounts in \u201cWords Are My Matter,\u201d a collection of nonfiction appearing this fall from Small Beer Press. \u201cWell, I was, in fact, the one to do it. So I did it.\u201dShe used her speech to decry \u201ccommodity profiteers\u201d who sold writers \u201clike deodorant, and tell us what to publish, what to write.\u201d She criticized our \u201cobsessive technologies\u201d that promote fear and greed.The speech, and her outrage, went viral. \u201cA writer in her mid-80s simply has less to lose,\u201d she said. \u201cAn author in midcareer who defies the hegemony of Google and Amazon, and names their immoral or unfair practices as such, takes an immediate risk of vengeance from them and of enmity from fellow writers who are cozy with them. I\u2019m taking the same risks, but what the hell. My work is out there \u2014 visible, existent.\u201d\u201cThat story is both a call and a practice for Le Guin,\u201d Mr. Diaz said. \u201cShe has spent all these decades trying to chart a path for those who wish to walk away from Omelas \u2014 also known as the horror of our civilization.\u201d\u201cThe Complete Orsinia\u201d is Ms. Le Guin in a quieter key. \u201cThe editorial challenge of the Library of America is to strike a balance,\u201d said Max Rudin, the library\u2019s publisher. \u201cOn the one hand to publish writers and works that are indisputably part of the American canon, and on the other hand to publish books that stretch people\u2019s imagination of what great American writing is.\u201dIn the introduction, she quotes from a 1975 notebook in which she wrote that much of her work was concerned with one central notion: \u201cTrue pilgrimage consists in coming home.\u201d The hero of \u201cMalafrena\u201d must leave his provincial farm only to find it again.\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between the circle and the spiral,\u201d Ms. Le Guin said. \u201cWe say the Earth has a circular orbit around the sun, but of course it doesn\u2019t. You never come back to the same place, you just come back to the same point on the spiral. That image is very deep in my thinking.\u201d\u201cOrsinia\u201d has another spiral: As Ms. Le Guin\u2019s works are being put in the canon, she has largely stopped writing. \u201cThe fiction isn\u2019t coming. You can\u2019t get water from a dry well.\u201d She still writes poetry, which is a consolation.There remains that other big legacy-cementing possibility. Last year, Ms. Le Guin was given Nobel odds of 25-1. Her conclusion: \u201cAll I have to do in the next 25 years is outlive the other 24 writers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Uber to Sell to Rival Didi Chuxing and Create New Business in China", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Uber\u2019s future in China seemed to hold promise.The sale, which would create a new company worth about $35 billion, would end the great ride-hailing battle of China. A person with knowledge of the deal said Uber investors had been pushing for such a transaction.The companies have been fighting relentlessly for market share in mainland China for two years, spending tens of millions of dollars every month to attract riders and drivers. The merger would end that competition and create significant scale, but it would also be a repudiation of Uber\u2019s ambitions to take on local Chinese competitors in their huge home market.Uber had pushed its way into a country that has gone almost untouched by major American tech companies in recent years. Its progress was widely watched and discussed by entrepreneurs and investors alike as a model for how to reach China\u2019s 600 million internet users \u2014 a forbidding prospect considering the country\u2019s well-funded local competitors and regulations aimed at blocking foreign businesses.With the deal, the company will join the ranks of American peers like Google and eBay, which were unable to capitalize on early footholds in China. EBay was outmaneuvered by Alibaba, while Google left China after it said it was the target of government-sponsored cyberattacks.Still, it is by no means a financial catastrophe for Uber, which for about $2 billion of investment in the Chinese market gets a $7 billion share in a company that is likely to grow. It also saves the cash it may have spent competing in China for other projects.\u201cHowever, as an entrepreneur, I\u2019ve learned that being successful is about listening to your head as well as following your heart,\u201d he wrote. \u201cUber and Didi Chuxing are investing billions of dollars in China and both companies have yet to turn a profit there.\u201dUnder the terms of the deal, the new company\u2019s estimated worth is a combination of Didi Chuxing\u2019s $28 billion valuation and Uber China\u2019s $7 billion, according to two people with knowledge of the deal, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the information had not yet been made public. Uber shareholders would receive a 20 percent stake in the new company.Over the past two years, Uber upended expectations in China and its business there grew, despite heavy regulation and internet filters that often limit access to the products of foreign tech companies. The early 2015 rollout of People\u2019s Uber, a service that got ordinary Chinese drivers behind the wheel and taking passengers, helped Uber grab a chunk of market share from Didi.As it grew in China, Uber avoided many of the mistakes made by of its American tech forebears. For one, the company created local teams based around different cities, allowing it to respond quickly and flexibly to moves by the competition. That set it apart from other companies, which sought to control Chinese operations from the United States, slowing their responses.But entry is just the first obstacle to the Chinese internet market. Competition is fierce, and the focus is less on the product than on big spending to lure customers or on tricks to harm competitors. Fraudsters and opportunists also abound.Uber\u2019s engineers, operating from San Francisco, had to deal with drivers who simulated or faked rides to get commissions. At the same time, the company was blocked from marketing on China\u2019s biggest social network, WeChat, because the internet giant Tencent was an early investor in Didi. All of that made it much harder to compete with a company that already had an advantage in scale, not to mention the backing of Tencent, Alibaba and Apple. When it raised $7 billion in June, Didi made it clear it was willing to continue the fight for a long time.For all the publicity around the spat between Uber and Didi, the two had been in talks stretching back to the Didi-Kuaidi merger in the beginning of 2015, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. That person said the two sides could not overcome disagreements about valuations at the time.In another quirk to the latest deal, two members of the same well-known family in the world of technology were on opposite sides of the negotiating table: Didi\u2019s president, Jean Liu, is the daughter of Liu Chuanzhi, the Chinese founder of the largest computer maker in the world, Lenovo. Her cousin, Zhen Liu, is a vice president and regular spokeswoman for Uber China.Although the tie-up is expected to reassure investors, Chinese analysts said it would probably lead to a decrease in commissions. That could hurt customers and drivers alike, the analysts said, making it harder for smaller players to compete because their larger rival would no longer be saddled with such an expense.\u201cFor smaller companies like Yidao or Shenzhou, if they keep subsidizing users, it will only be temporary and will bring more financial burdens,\u201d said Hong Bo, an independent technology analyst in China.Li Bo, a 22-year-old driver from Henan, said the loyalty of drivers is determined by where they could get the best pay. That meant they would continue to follow the subsidies, he said.\u201cAll we care is who gives us the best deal,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Didi buys Uber, we just work for Didi. It doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201dPaul Mozur reported from Hong Kong, and Mike Isaac from San Francisco. Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting from New York.

{"Headline": "Delphi and Mobileye to Produce System for Self-Driving Cars", "Date": "2016-08-23", "News": "Supported byThe race to build self-driving cars is becoming an increasingly crowded field.And then there are suppliers, like Delphi Automotive and Mobileye, that intend to develop turnkey self-driving systems that automakers could build into their vehicles.Delphi, formed out of the former parts division of General Motors, and Mobileye, a rising Israeli company known for producing the sensors and other technology that help cars recognize obstacles in the road, said on Tuesday that they had formed a partnership to provide self-driving components to automakers by the end of 2019.Mobileye and Delphi said they expected to demonstrate an early version of their system in January at the 2017 International CES, the annual consumer electronics show, in Las Vegas and to begin production of a commercial version within two years.Mobileye is already a vendor of computer-vision technology and other related systems to carmakers. For Delphi, the partnership is an extension of its other efforts to develop self-driving cars, including a project with the government of Singapore to field a test fleet of driverless taxis. In 2015, a driverless car built by Delphi completed a 3,400-mile trip from San Francisco to New York in nine days.The Mobileye-Delphi collaboration \u201cwill accelerate the time to market\u201d and enable carmakers to produce vehicles capable of driving themselves \u201cwithout the need for huge capital investments,\u201d Amnon Shashua, chairman and chief technology officer of Mobileye, said on Tuesday in a conference call with reporters.Delphi\u2019s chief executive, Kevin Clark, added, \u201cWe believe this reshapes the automated driving landscape.\u201dNot so long ago, it seemed that Google and, separately, the electric carmaker Tesla Motors had clear leads over the traditional auto industry in developing technology for autonomous vehicles.Google has been testing its self-driving cars for a few years. Tesla grabbed the spotlight for a time after introducing its Autopilot feature last fall, although a fatal accident in May of a driver using the system has made clear that Autopilot is still far from being a self-driving car technology.But efforts to create self-driving cars are evolving so rapidly that traditional carmakers see an opening.Ford said last week that it would have a fully autonomous vehicle \u2014 with no steering wheels or pedals \u2014 operating in a ride-hailing service like Uber within five years. It expects to have 30 self-driving test cars on public roads by the end of this year and up to 90 by the end of 2017.The conventional car companies, with millions of vehicles already on the road, are trying to create a transition from driver-assistance and collision-avoidance systems already in their most advanced vehicles to a future of fully self-driving vehicles.BMW in July said it was partnering with Mobileye and Intel, the chip maker, in plans to offer a self-driving model by 2021.G.M. and Audi expect to offer enhanced cruise control and collision-avoidance systems in some 2018 models that they say will be the equals of, or more capable than, Tesla\u2019s Autopilot.Tesla\u2019s position is also uncertain because of the fatal crash in which Autopilot failed to recognize a truck crossing a road. Since news of that crash emerged, the company has emphasized that Autopilot is not intended to be a fully autonomous system and that drivers must keep their hands on the steering wheel and eyes on the road while using it, although YouTube videos show that some drivers do not follow the company\u2019s instructions.Autopilot uses Mobileye\u2019s sensor and processing technology. But the companies have recently parted ways. In a conference call, Mr. Shashua said Mobileye was unhappy with the way Tesla was using its technology.Not all carmakers predict that self-driving cars will proliferate rapidly. Honda Motor argues that more advanced technology is needed beyond the cameras and radar systems that are in use for the current driver-assist and collision-prevention systems, said Jim Keller, chief engineer at Honda\u2019s research center in Southfield, Mich.\u201cSensing technology is getting better and better, but it\u2019s not perfect,\u201d he said. Honda also says it believes cars need vehicle-to-vehicle, or V2V, communication devices that allow them to transmit their position and speed to other vehicles.\u201cRadar or a camera can only see what it can see,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what\u2019s around the corner or behind a building? You need V2V for that.\u201dDelphi, in the partnership with Mobileye, plans to provide automated driving software it has developed, as well as technology that uses cameras, radar and lidar, a type of radar based on laser beams. Delphi\u2019s current radar and sensing technology is used by many automakers for collision-avoidance, lane keeping, cruise control and automatic braking systems.The system the partners produce is intended to go first into automobiles that have steering wheels and gas and brake pedals, and it will be meant to assist, rather than replace, drivers.But the aim is to adapt those systems for fully self-driving cars.Mr. Shashua said the companies were relying on advances in sensing and \u201ca new class of machine intelligence\u201d to be successful. Fully autonomous vehicles \u201cneed sensing capable of recognizing moving objects and merging into traffic in a way that mimics human behavior,\u201d he said.Mr. Clark, the Delphi chief, said the companies would spend \u201chundreds of millions of dollars\u201d on the partnership without giving a more precise estimate.Mr. Shashua added that Mobileye\u2019s work with Delphi would complement the collaboration his company announced this summer with BMW and Intel.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Teju Cole\u2019s Essays Build Connections Between African and Western Art", "Date": "2016-08-09", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.In \u201cThe Anxiety of Influence,\u201d the renowned critic Harold Bloom argued that poets, especially those in the Western tradition since the Renaissance, necessarily negotiate the work of their predecessors as they write. \u201cThe precursors flood us,\u201d Bloom wrote, \u201cand our imaginations can die by drowning in them, but no imaginative life is possible if such inundation is wholly evaded.\u201d Cole shares Bloom\u2019s interest in the fraught and burdened relationship writers and artists have to our ancestors, and he seeks to answer yet another question: How does the imagination cross and recross racial and filial boundaries, and what does this crossing mean? With our ever-enlarging global access to the visions and voices and influences of others, Cole attempts to untangle the knot of who or what belongs to us and to whom or what do we belong as artists, thinkers and, finally, human beings.In this light, \u201cBlack Body,\u201d the opening essay in \u201cKnown and Strange Things,\u201d engages the \u201cquestion of filiation\u201d that tormented James Baldwin in his essay \u201cStranger in the Village.\u201d Baldwin, reflecting on his stay in the white-peopled Swiss village of Leukerbad, was moved to write that \u201cthe most illiterate among them is related, in a way I am not, to Dante, Shakespeare, Michelangelo. .\u2008.\u2008. Out of their hymns and dances come Beethoven and Bach. Go back a few centuries and they are in their full glory \u2014 but I am in Africa, watching the conquerors arrive.\u201dCole, revisiting the terrain of Leukerbad, pairs himself with Baldwin (also echoing, in his parenthesis, the poet Elizabeth Bishop\u2019s \u201cOne Art\u201d): \u201cI am black like him; and I am slender; and have a gap in my front teeth and am not especially tall (no, write it: short) .\u2008.\u2008. and feel myself in all places, from New York City to rural Switzerland, the custodian of a black body, and have to find the language for all of what that means to me and to the people who look at me. The ancestor had briefly taken possession of the descendant.\u201dBut Cole soon distances himself from Baldwin\u2019s feeling of alienation. He states that Baldwin\u2019s \u201cself-abnegation\u201d prevents him from embracing Bach or Rembrandt, who Cole insists do not belong to one race. He might even care more about these artists \u201cthan some white people do,\u201d Cole writes.The first section of the collection, \u201cReading Things,\u201d has Cole claiming filiation with a number of authors (all male) who prove important to him. In the case of many of them, influence begets influence. Along with Baldwin comes V.S. Naipaul (\u201cThe benevolent rheumy-eyed old soul: so fond of the word \u2018nigger,\u2019 so aggressive in his lack of sympathy toward Africa, so brutal in his treatment of woman\u201d); Tomas Transtromer (\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I\u2019m unembarrassable about influence, because I realize now how many of Transtromer\u2019s concepts I have hidden away in my own work\u201d); W.G. Sebald (\u201cThis expert mixing of forms owed a great deal to his reading of the 17th-\u00adcentury melancholics Robert Burton and Thomas Browne\u201d); Derek Walcott (\u201cHe names painters as his exemplars more often than he names poets: Pissarro, Veronese, C\u00e9zanne, Manet, Gauguin and Millet roll through the \u00adpages\u201d); and Andr\u00e9 Aciman (\u201cAciman\u2019s debt to Proust is deep and freely acknowledged\u201d).This opening section concludes with \u201cA Conversation With Aleksandar Hemon,\u201d in which Hemon \u2014 a writer and critic and self-identified \u201cdiasporic person\u201d \u2014 questions Cole on what Nigerian history means to him. Cole\u2019s answer catapults him into a global context: \u201cMy identity maps onto other things: being a Lagosian (Lagos is like a city-state), being a West African, being African, being a part of the Black Atlantic. I identify strongly with the historical network that connects New York, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro and Lagos.\u201d Hemon is also interested in what happens when influences are constantly shaping and reshaping the imagination. For Cole, visual artists, especially painters, are least affected by that anxiety of influence and \u201cknow that everything is a combination of what\u2019s observed, what\u2019s imagined, what\u2019s overheard and what\u2019s been done before.\u201d He argues that to acknowledge influence is to let go of notions of \u201cliteral records of reality\u201d and cultural or racial ownership of content. All Cole wants is to be \u201cdragged down into a space of narrative that I haven\u2019t been in before.\u201dThe stunning second section, \u201cSeeing Things,\u201d is especially captivating and reveals Cole\u2019s voracious appetite for and love of the visual. Taken together, the essays in this section provide a comprehensive look at contemporary photography, placed within a historical framework. This approach brings forward evidence of things unseen, things, as Susan Sontag put it, \u201cleast likely to be known.\u201d The artists who have Cole\u2019s attention impose their individual and subjective sense on the material of the world, rejecting the notion, as most photographers do by nature, that it is possible to capture objective \u201crecords of reality.\u201d He is drawn toward filmmakers and the visual artists who see with this photographer\u2019s orientation. The collage work of Wangechi Mutu, described as \u201cboth easy and difficult to look at, seductive in their patterning, grotesque in their themes,\u201d relies on actual photographic images; Cole\u2019s favorite films by Michael Haneke and Krzysztof Kieslowski bring into view images of life so ordinary they could escape our attention. Cole believes that all of this work allows us to think with the eyes, and though the Australian composer Peter Sculthrope is also included here, his music becomes a passageway into the landscape and history of Australia.But it\u2019s the essays that focus explicitly on photography, especially, that demand our attention. Cole considers here the work of both well and lesser known photographers such as Seydou Keita, Malick Sidibe, J.D. \u2019Okhai Ojeikere, Joseph Moise Agbodjelou, Zanele Muholi, Henri \u00adCartier-Bresson, Sergei Ilnitsky, Sam Abell, Glenna Gordan, Saul Leiter, Richard Renaldi, Thomas Demand, as well as Google-based photographic and filmic practitioners like Doug Rickard, Mishka Henner, Aaron Hobson, Michael Wolf and Dina Kelberman. These photographers, whether reframing \u201canthropological images of \u2018natives\u2019 made by Europeans in the late 19th and early 20th centuries\u201d or applying a curatorial eye to the world around us, are democratizing the history of photography.When the occasional essay fails to hold interest it\u2019s because the connections Cole draws to some European lineage remain tenuous. This is the case, for example, with Cole\u2019s meditation on death through the woodcuts entitled \u201cPictures of Death,\u201d by Hans Holbein the Younger, which brings him to the killing of the African-\u00adAmerican Walter Scott by a South Carolina police officer in 2015, which in turn makes him think about the writer Sir Walter Scott and one of his short stories, about a premeditated murder, \u201cThe Two Drovers.\u201d This associative style enables Cole to move across disciplines and through time, but in this case seems tendentious.In the third section, \u201cBeing There,\u201d photography\u2019s ability as a discipline to present a unique archive of reality comes most clearly into light. These essays track Cole\u2019s journeys around an explosive world of drones, wars and diseases, including the kidnappings of young girls in Chibok and assassinations of terror suspects by drone warfare. Cole happens to be streets away when the poet Kofi Awoonor is killed in a terrorist massacre in a Nairobi mall. He finds in Awoonor\u2019s work some echoes of T.S. Eliot, but Cole ends his essay with a line from Awoonor, himself quoting \u201can ancient poet from my tradition\u201d: \u201cI will say it before death comes. And if I don\u2019t say it, let no one say it for me. I will be the one who will say it.\u201d Even as Cole positions Awoonor relative to the European tradition, he also allows Awoonor to have the last word.One of the most resonant and powerful essays in \u201cBeing There\u201d is \u201cThe White Savior Industrial Complex,\u201d an expansion of Cole\u2019s seven-part-Twitter-feed response to \u201cKony 2012,\u201d a video calling for the arrest of the Ugandan rebel leader Joseph Kony. He meditates more fully here on the interconnectivity of American political polices to their outcome. Activist philanthropy that begins in amnesia lacks, in Cole\u2019s words, \u201cconstellational thinking.\u201d He lays bear the relationship among sentimentality, ignorance, corruption, pillage and complicity within our global communities. Under Cole\u2019s watchful eye the world shrinks into a network of countries, communities and individuals influenced by, dependent on and affected by other countries, communities and individuals.This brilliant collection closes with an epilogue, \u201cBlind Spot,\u201d in which Cole recounts the time he first had an episode of papillophlebitis, or \u201cbig blind spot syndrome.\u201d If epilogues benefit from hindsight, it\u2019s difficult not to feel the piece is intended by Cole to be read diagnostically, beyond its autobiographical content. In the essay, Cole admits to feeling shame as he worries that a waitress in a Hudson, N.Y., cafe he stumbles into might not interpret his inability to read a menu as eye trouble but assume instead that he was \u201cilliterate.\u201d This use of the word \u201cilliterate\u201d is an echo of the James Baldwin quotation in the first essay in the collection, \u201cBlack Body.\u201d Suddenly the essays endeavoring to connect and build lines of influence between the canon of Western and African literature and art tremble as they stand in relation to the strange and surprising feeling of being misread. How quickly the black body can be thrown out of its cosmopolitanism and literacy, as the author\u2019s own anxieties overtake him sitting at a counter in that cafe next to \u201ctwo blond women and two men, also fair haired.\u201dCole\u2019s global perspective hits its limit here. History \u2014 literary, political, social or personal \u2014 offers us a vast archive of knowledge that both influences and challenges the definitions we construct for ourselves. On every level of engagement and critique, \u201cKnown and Strange Things\u201d is an essential and scintillating journey.Claudia Rankine is the Iseman professor of poetry at Yale.

{"Headline": "Apple, Congress and the Missing Taxes", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialApple and the United States are crying foul over the ruling in Europe that Apple received illegal tax breaks from Ireland and must hand over 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion), a record tax penalty in Europe.But Apple and the United States have only themselves to blame for the situation.Initially, deferral was a convenience for multinationals, as they sought investment opportunities abroad. Today, it is the taproot of global tax avoidance. Financial engineering has let American companies shift profits into foreign accounts, while they lobby Congress for tax-rate cuts in exchange for repatriating the money. Currently, there is some $2 trillion in corporate profits in offshore tax-deferred accounts; besides Apple, Microsoft, Google, Cisco and Oracle also have large stashes. Apple is one of nearly two dozen major corporations pushing Congress for a \u201ctax holiday,\u201d which would let companies bring back foreign-held money over the course of a year at a discounted tax rate, rather than the current rate, 35 percent.Before the European ruling on Tuesday, the debate over a tax holiday had pitted Republicans, who have generally favored the idea, against Democrats, who have viewed it as an unjustified reward for tax avoidance. The Democrats have history on their side. A tax holiday in 2005 lowered the corporate rate to 5.25 percent, enticing corporations to repatriate some $300 billion. It was billed as a way to create jobs and increase investment, but the money was used mostly for dividend payments, share buybacks (which tend to raise executive pay) and severance for laid-off employees. Worse, the tax holiday inspired multinationals to stash as much money abroad as they possibly could in anticipation of another holiday.The European ruling, however, could sharply alter the terms of the congressional debate. Republicans and Democrats alike have always assumed that foreign-held profits would one day be repatriated. The big question was the rate at which they would ultimately be taxed. Similarly, the Treasury assumes that deferred foreign profits will one day be taxed when it projects future revenues \u2014 an important measure of the nation\u2019s fiscal health.But the money won\u2019t be repatriated and taxed under American law if Europeans, in the course of enforcing their own laws against tax havens, get their hands on it first. And that, in a nutshell, is why members of Congress and Treasury officials are so upset about the Apple ruling. They understand, correctly, that tax-law enforcement in Europe could reduce the sums they expect to collect taxes on someday. What they don\u2019t understand, or aren\u2019t saying, is that they brought the problem on themselves.The way forward is not to declare a tax war with Europe. It is for Congress to agree on a way to tax foreign-held corporate profits. President Obama put forth a reasonable approach in 2015, when he proposed a mandatory 14 percent tax on multinationals\u2019 current offshore profits \u2014 whether they are repatriated or not \u2014 and, thereafter, a new minimum tax rate of 19 percent on profits moved offshore. An even better approach would be to simply end indefinite corporate tax deferral, imposing American taxes on profits when they are made.Republicans rejected Mr. Obama\u2019s proposal in 2015, and there is no chance that lawmakers will engage in such a debate so close to the election. But the next president and Congress will need to act to ensure that at long last, American corporations pay their fair share in taxes.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alphabet Expands Car-Pooling Project, Casting Shadow on Uber", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Alphabet and Uber are inching closer to a showdown.Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is broadening the scope of a car-pooling program that could challenge ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft. The pilot program, operated through Google\u2019s navigation app Waze, is limited to employees of companies near Google\u2019s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif.In the fall, Waze plans to expand the program to users in San Francisco, where Uber is based, according to a person briefed on the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly about it.Unlike ride services that summon drivers immediately, Waze suggests calling for a ride a few hours in advance. When a user wants a ride in the same direction, Waze offers the driver a price to pick up that passenger.For now, Waze is keeping the cost of rides below the federal standard mileage rates of 54 cents a mile, making it impractical for drivers to make a living from driving. Under its terms of service, Google said it may deduct \u201ca commission\u201d from the price of the ride.Google\u2019s expansion of the program is another indication of the intensifying competition between the two companies. As the company toes the waters of the ride-hailing industry, Uber has made clear its intentions to break into autonomous vehicle technology, a longtime area of interest for Google and its self-driving car experimentation.Next month, Uber plans to start its first pilot program of self-driving cars in Pittsburgh, home to the ride-hailing firm\u2019s autonomous technology research efforts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Helps Develop Software That Puts Students in Charge of Their Lesson Plans", "Date": "2016-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPriscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook, last month. They were the catalysts for Facebook\u2019s partnership to build classroom software with Summit Public Schools.Facebook is out to upend the traditional student-teacher relationship.Rather than have teachers hand out class assignments, the Facebook-Summit learning management system puts students in charge of selecting their projects and setting their pace. The idea is to encourage students to develop skills, like resourcefulness and time management, that might help them succeed in college.\u201cAs parents and kids and teachers get access to this type of learning, I think more and more will want it,\u201d Diane Tavenner, the co-founder and chief executive of Summit Public Schools, said in a telephone interview.But the Summit-Facebook system, called the \u201cSummit Personalized Learning Platform,\u201d is different.The software gives students a full view of their academic responsibilities for the year in each class and breaks them down into customizable lesson modules they can tackle at their own pace. A student working on a science assignment, for example, may choose to create a project using video, text or audio files. Students may also work asynchronously, tackling different sections of the year\u2019s work at the same time.The system inverts the traditional teacher-led classroom hierarchy, requiring schools to provide intensive one-on-one mentoring and coaching to help each student adapt.This summer, more than 1,500 educators and leaders of public, private and charter schools participating in the program, called Summit Basecamp, attended sessions to learn how to use the system. Among the 19 schools that introduced the new learning approach last year, at least a few educators and administrators reported a steep learning curve.\u201cThere were many points where we weren\u2019t sure the Summit Basecamp model was what our students needed,\u201d said Claire Fisher, the principal of Urban Promise Academy, a public middle school in Oakland, Calif., which introduced the platform in its sixth-grade classes.By the end of the school year, however, 31 percent of the school\u2019s sixth graders were reading at or above their grade level, compared with just 9 percent in the fall. That was a larger improvement in reading than students in seventh and eighth grades, which did not use the platform, Ms. Fisher said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Arianna Huffington Is Leaving Huffington Post", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySince it started 11 years ago, The Huffington Post has been synonymous with the personality and the interests of its co-founder, Arianna Huffington.The pioneering web publication, known for its aggressive use of aggregation and an unapologetically liberal worldview, would go on to win a Pulitzer Prize and expand globally during a challenging time for all media organizations.But over the last year, The Huffington Post has found itself an increasingly small part of an increasingly large media and tech conglomerate. When Verizon, which announced it had purchased The Huffington Post\u2019s parent company, AOL, in May 2015, bought Yahoo\u2019s internet business last month, Ms. Huffington\u2019s perch at the company seemed increasingly precarious.With her abrupt announcement on Thursday that she was stepping down as editor in chief of The Huffington Post and leaving the company to focus on her new venture, a health and wellness start-up called Thrive Global, she leaves the publication in an unfamiliar position. For the first time since its founding in 2005, The Huffington Post will be without Ms. Huffington. No successor was named.In an interview, Ms. Huffington, 66, said she had originally intended to run The Huffington Post while working to start Thrive Global. But that plan soon reached its limits.\u201cThe original idea was that I could do both,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it very quickly turned out to be an illusion.\u201dAlong with her success, Ms. Huffington has been a polarizing figure in the media world, and her presence in the newsroom has not always been constant. But since Verizon bought AOL, her interests seemed to increasingly move beyond running The Huffington Post. After the sale, there was speculation that she would leave the company, concerns allayed when she signed a four-year contract in June 2015.Other moves have generated misgivings in the newsroom. The publication\u2019s decision last summer to put articles about Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign in its entertainment section and a later decision to add an editor\u2019s note calling Mr. Trump a \u201cserial liar\u201d and a \u201cracist\u201d to any article about him raised questions about whether Ms. Huffington was unduly influencing coverage to suit her political agenda.In April, the announcement that she was joining Uber\u2019s board rankled employees who feared inherent conflicts of interest in coverage. (She said she would recuse herself from being involved with any coverage of the company.) The publication has also been criticized for what some see as excessive coverage of sleep and wellness, topics on which Ms. Huffington has written books.At the same time, staff attrition, evidenced by a flurry of goodbye emails over the last year, has taken a toll on morale. In that context, Ms. Huffington\u2019s decision to leave surprised an already anxious newsroom.At a staff meeting Thursday morning in The Huffington Post\u2019s Manhattan headquarters, Ms. Huffington stressed her confidence in the organization. \u201cGreat companies always succeed beyond their founder,\u201d she said, according to an article by Michael Calderone, the publication\u2019s media reporter. \u201cEven though HuffPost bears my name, it is absolutely about all of you and about this amazing team we\u2019ve been for over 11 years.\u201dTim Armstrong, the chief executive of AOL, was not present. But in a statement, he called Ms. Huffington a \u201cvisionary who built The Huffington Post into a truly transformative news platform.\u201d\u201cToday, The Huffington Post is a firmly established and celebrated news source, and AOL and Verizon are committed to continuing its growth and the groundbreaking work Arianna pioneered,\u201d he added.When The Huffington Post was founded, there was no Twitter, and Facebook was still a relatively fledgling online platform primarily used by college students. Initially, the idea was to create an aggregation site that would be a liberal counterpart to the Drudge Report. Ms. Huffington, who had recently run for governor of California, said at the time that she had signed up more than 250 of \u201cthe most creative minds\u201d in the country, including Walter Cronkite, Nora Ephron and Norman Mailer, to write a group blog on topics including politics and entertainment.The Huffington Post did not just take the internet seriously; it ruthlessly embraced as opportunities trends that established media companies perceived as threats. The company demonstrated early and continued mastery over Google, capturing audiences through search with carefully engineered headlines and fast aggregation. The publication consistently outranked its competitors in search, often with blog posts based on its competitors\u2019 work. But while the strategy proved successful, the site\u2019s ability to package articles from other publications also prompted criticism, and many in the media world accused it of aggregation excesses that bordered on intellectual theft.Over the years, however, it has pushed aggressively to produce more original content. The site also published articles by non-journalists, who often contributed without being paid.AOL purchased the publication for $315 million in 2011 and Ms. Huffington assumed control of AOL\u2019s editorial content. The Huffington Post won a Pulitzer Prize in 2012 for a series on wounded veterans.Ms. Huffington\u2019s relationship with Mr. Armstrong was rocky almost from the start, several current and former employees said, and some said her outside interests kept her out of the newsroom for extended periods.When AOL sold itself to Verizon for $4.4 billion, there was speculation that Ms. Huffington might leave. She had become an increasingly powerful force in her own right: She has published several books on health and wellness, including \u201cThrive\u201d and \u201cThe Sleep Revolution,\u201d and she has become a champion of the benefits of a good night\u2019s sleep.Though Ms. Huffington\u2019s departure came as a shock, it was in some ways inevitable, particularly after she announced the formation of Thrive Global in June.In the interview, Ms. Huffington said she had thought about leaving The Huffington Post for \u201ca while,\u201d and the closing of a funding round for Thrive Global last week ultimately drove her move. \u201cIt was my decision\u201d to leave, she said, adding that the contract she signed last year had a carve-out clause that allowed her to start a new venture.Ms. Huffington said she would stay on at the publication until early September.\u201cI\u2019m going to be very much around for the rest of the month, helping in every way I can, including having Greek sweets in my office,\u201d she said, a nod to her home country and her distinctive accent.Mr. Armstrong said in a note to staff that the company had formed an interim editorial committee that would act in Ms. Huffington\u2019s place. The committee will also be involved in what Mr. Armstrong described as \u201can ongoing search\u201d for a new editor in chief.In a separate note to employees, Jared Grusd, the chief executive of The Huffington Post, called Thursday a \u201cday of change.\u201d\u201cToday,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis the first day of the next chapter in HuffPost\u2019s history.\u201dJohn Herrman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But as far as Google Maps is concerned, it actually had not been.\u201cThere has never been a \u2018Palestine\u2019 label on Google Maps, however we discovered a bug that removed the labels for \u2018West Bank\u2019 and \u2018Gaza Strip,\u2019 \u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re working quickly to bring these labels back to the area.\u201d It is unclear if that bug played a role in spurring the online outrage.Elizabeth Davidoff, a spokeswoman, said in an email that the company had also never used the label \u201cPalestinian territories\u201d on its maps. The bug affecting the words \u201cGaza Strip\u201d and \u201cWest Bank\u201d persisted on Wednesday, but when Google Maps functions properly both areas are labeled and separated from Israel by a dotted line to signify that their borders are not internationally recognized.The word \u201cPalestine\u201d was recently removed from the local home page of the company\u2019s search engine, but the reason was aesthetic, not political, Ms. Davidoff said. It was taken down to make space for an Olympics-themed Google doodle, a design that sometimes greets users, as were country-specific tag lines for every country in the world.\u201cThere\u2019s no Google-wide effort to remove Palestine or anything like that,\u201d Ms. Davidoff said in an email. She said a GIF circulating online (and shared by the activist group Jewish Voice for Peace) that claimed to show a before-and-after image that proved the alleged deletion, was fake.So, how did this happen?Part of it is a by-now familiar dynamic on social media. People are inclined to believe claims that reinforce their pre-existing beliefs, especially if they produce an emotional response.Kate Klonick, a resident fellow at the Information Society Project at Yale Law School, said the cycle of outrage on social media is \u201creactive, its emotional, its not particularly thoughtful, but it is satisfying in a lot of ways for people.\u201dAnd few issues are more emotionally fraught than the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, one of the most intractable and heated disputes in international affairs. The anger of Google\u2019s critics was unlikely to be soothed by the facts of this case, Ms. Klonick said.\u201cIf you were upset that you thought Google removed Palestine, it does not ameliorate your anger at all to find out they never had Palestine there to begin with,\u201d she said.Emad Zakaria, who wrote the statement, said he heard the claim that Google removed the word \u201cPalestine\u201d from the website of a Palestinian organization in Lebanon whose name he could not remember.\u201cAnyone looking for Palestine on Google will not be able to find it,\u201d he said.Still, the initial source of the outrage remains a mystery.The claims about Google had extra emotional weight because they involved a visual representation of Israel and Palestine, Ms. Dann said. \u201cMaps have always been political, and the ways that borders are demarcated on them is always political,\u201d she said.Rami Nazzal contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

She relies on apps like Google Docs for documents and Google Slides for presentations, which are available through a web browser.\u201cA tablet is just like your cellphone, but bigger,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see a point of getting a tablet.\u201dBut Claire Ashcroft, 19, who studies public health at Brigham Young University in Idaho, said the opposite. Half of her textbooks are digitized, and she uses apps like Microsoft Excel and Word \u2014 so her ideal school device would be a Windows machine with a touch screen, like a Microsoft Surface tablet.The polarizing responses illustrate how back-to-school shopping for technology gadgets has become increasingly complex for parents. In the past, the dilemma for most students was whether to get a Windows PC or a Mac. Now, because of a proliferation of different computing forms with the rise of mobile devices, the debate has shifted toward whether to buy a computer or a tablet \u2014 and which operating system on top of that.Then there are the different types of software and tools that students use, like flashcard apps or readers for digital textbooks, some of which are for mobile devices and others for computers.To make back-to-school season easier, parents should have a conversation with their children about what devices and which operating system to buy based on their student\u2019s area of studies and the apps they use.I also compiled a guide to some of the best back-to-school products, including computers, mobile devices, audio accessories and food gadgets. The list was curated after testing dozens of products and interviewing five college students about the tools that help them do homework and get through cramming sessions. (While this list focuses on college students, many of whom will be getting their own computers for the first time, some items would also be a good fit for high schoolers.)The students I polled were split on whether a laptop or tablet would be the best study tool. In general, students in science-oriented fields would probably benefit from a laptop, which can handle multitasking more easily and run more powerful apps than tablets. For designers and liberal arts majors who are using more lightweight apps for writing essays or drawing sketches, a tablet may be a better fit.There are two caveats. First, Apple is expected to release a brand-new iPhone this fall; so if you go the Apple route, it would be wise to wait a few months. Second, these are high-end phones that cost roughly $700, which could easily blow your budget.High-quality audio gear is a sound investment for students. Roommates can be loud distractions from schoolwork and sleep, plus a bit of music can ease the pain of typing out a tedious essay.Speaking of water kettles, a food gadget or two will not go amiss in students\u2019 lives, especially if the devices offer a shortcut to downing some caffeine or gobbling up ramen.But she would like a Microsoft Surface tablet.\u201cIf we\u2019re talking wishful here, I would choose that,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a couple of friends with those, and I think they\u2019re pretty nice.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the maker of the Nexus 6P.

{"Headline": "After Ailes and Cosby, a Moment for More Women to Speak Up", "Date": "2016-08-07", "News": "Supported byIn the fall of 1991, an obscure law professor named Anita Hill pushed the issue of sexual harassment into the public consciousness when she accused her former boss, the Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, of having repeatedly made lewd overtures toward her.But the episode sent a mixed message, in the view of many discrimination experts. While it raised awareness about a corrosive workplace behavior, the intense backlash against Ms. Hill, not least from members of the United States Senate, suggested that women faced great obstacles in redressing such abuses. (Mr. Thomas denied the allegations.)Nearly 25 years later, after a string of sexual harassment allegations that led to the ouster of Roger Ailes, the former chairman of Fox News, and a cascade of sexual assault accusations against the comedian Bill Cosby, some of those experts believe we may be approaching another Anita Hill moment.The Ailes and Cosby cases, they say, could be influential among women across the work force not just because of the intrinsic power of these examples, but because they come at a moment of empowerment for women in their struggle for equality. And when women\u2019s assertiveness produces dramatic results like the resignation of Mr. Ailes, it can inspire more women to follow the same path.\u201cWhen Anita Hill came out against Clarence Thomas, she got nothing and Clarence Thomas got life tenure,\u201d said Linda Hirshman, a Supreme Court biographer and former women\u2019s studies professor. \u201cIf anything would make the idea of women coming forward into a real threat, it would be the wicked confluence of everybody\u2019s dad, Bill Cosby, and Roger Ailes, the scariest man in the world \u2014 the fact that those two are going down.\u201dStill, workplace advocates caution that a greater sense of power, and even high-profile legal victories, will not necessarily lead to a significant increase in the number of women who take formal action. They note studies indicating that the great majority of sexual harassment incidents at work still go unreported.That sentiment was echoed by Carol Costello, a CNN anchor who, in a segment that aired last week, said that she had been sexually harassed when she was younger. Ms. Costello said she was inspired by the Ailes and Cosby cases to step forward, and thought it was important \u201cto add my voice to the cause,\u201d but was skeptical about whether it would lead to systemic change.\u201cI still think that there are consequences for women who come forward vocally or file lawsuits,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cA part of me still thinks that things haven\u2019t changed all that much.\u201dThe number of women filing sexual harassment charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission did increase significantly in the years after Ms. Hill came forward. But the impact of her testimony on that increase was somewhat muddied by a 1991 law that gave people alleging employment discrimination the right to a jury trial and allowed for additional monetary awards.Widely publicized cases appear to have played a role in prompting others to come forward in a variety of narrower contexts as well.A similar pattern appears to have played out in the banking industry. After the equal employment commission joined a prominent discrimination case against Morgan Stanley in 2001, the agency saw an uptick in sex discrimination charges from inside financial firms.The advertising industry has had its own increase in women speaking out. In March, the chief executive of the storied agency J. Walter Thompson resigned after a female employee filed a lawsuit accusing him of racist and sexist behavior. Within weeks, a number of top female executives had come forward to publicly describe their own experiences with sexism in the industry.The matter involving Gretchen Carlson, the former Fox anchor who filed a sexual harassment and retaliation lawsuit against Mr. Ailes last month, appears to be having a similar effect, beginning with at least two women who breached settlement agreements to describe their own experiences at the network.Kamee Verdrager, a lawyer, is pursuing her own yearslong legal battle over allegations of discrimination against a former employer, the law firm Mintz Levin, which stripped her of two years\u2019 seniority after she returned from maternity leave, and subsequently fired her. (Mintz Levin denies the allegations of discrimination but doesn\u2019t dispute these facts.) She said that prior examples of women speaking out could provide an enormous psychological boost for others contemplating their own action.In Ms. Verdrager\u2019s case, reading a book about women\u2019s struggles to succeed in the legal profession, which included numerous interviews with women who had faced discrimination, helped persuade her to file her complaint. \u201cThat book changed my life,\u201d she said. \u201cThe takeaway was that this is not unique to me. It\u2019s epidemic.\u201dBut the same connectedness that can provide support for victims can also work against them; some plaintiff\u2019s lawyers argue that the risks of speaking out have actually increased over time. Three decades ago, a court filing would have been extremely difficult for a prospective employer to uncover. Today, said Linda D. Friedman, a prominent employment lawyer who has brought many cases against Wall Street firms, the \u201ctroublemaker\u201d charge is likely to dog plaintiffs their entire lives.\u201cAny H.R. person in the country can do a Google search and come up with a federal complaint before deciding whether to hire a person,\u201d she said.To the extent that a high-profile case like Ms. Carlson\u2019s may encourage more survivors of harassment to come forward, many advocates say, it is more likely to happen indirectly, by first persuading employers to take discrimination and harassment claims more seriously. Only after most employees believe they can speak up without risking their careers, a development that many plaintiff\u2019s lawyers doubt is imminent, will they do so in substantially larger numbers.Still, if the fallout from the accusations against Mr. Cosby and Mr. Ailes is any indication, an increasing number of women may be concluding that speaking up is more likely than before to result in punishment for the alleged perpetrator rather than the accuser.Ms. Hill, now a professor at Brandeis University, is cautiously optimistic, though she worries that the $40 million payment Mr. Ailes reportedly received to leave Fox News could detract from the lesson of the case.\u201cThe fact the company is now not only talking to the women\u201d who have said they experienced harassment, \u201cbut also talking about whether others were enablers, that\u2019s important,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen who experienced harassment in their own workplace may see this as a possible outcome.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Boulder, Where Inner Peace Meets Outer Beauty", "Date": "2016-08-31", "News": "Supported byCultured TravelerMy cultural pilgrimage to the Rocky Mountains began more than 20 years ago, a few steps from my door in the East Village of Manhattan. The poet Allen Ginsberg was staging one of the regular readings at St. Mark\u2019s Church in-the-Bowery, featuring his Buddhist-inspired verse. As he fielded queries after the reading, he mentioned that he was decamping to teach at something called the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics in, of all places, Boulder, Colo.Poetry in Boulder? Until then, I had envisioned the town as a high-altitude boot camp, where every resident dressed in colorful spandex and went hiking, biking and climbing with grim determination. When it came to culture, it was hard to imagine anything more profound than the \u201cMork and Mindy\u201d house, whose exterior is featured in the TV series. But Ginsberg insisted that Boulder was actually brimming with progressive artists, writers and musicians. It used to be called \u201cthe Athens of the West,\u201d he enthused.So as an Amazonian heat wave descended on New York a year ago, I decided to finally make the expedition to the Rockies to answer a question: How does culture thrive in a world of free-climbers and triathletes, who one might think are more concerned with perfectly formed abs than deeper questions of the soul? Or has Boulder\u2019s very intimacy with the great outdoors created a cultural scene all its own?Arriving on a hot but blissfully dry July night was a disorienting experience, and not just because of the thin alpine air. At first glance, Boulder seemed dreamily pleasant, as clean and orderly as a Swiss resort, but not exactly in bohemian ferment.On the tidy Pearl Street Mall, crowds were gathered by burbling fountains to watch buskers, jugglers and flame-swallowers. Uplifting mountain views framed every corner. The bike lanes were so perfectly drawn they qualified as site-specific sculptures. In fact, everyone was so cheerful, healthy and fresh-faced that I had to fight the urge to flee back to Manhattan.The Chautauqua\u2019s once-austere teetotaling regimen has clearly loosened up. When I arrived, the historic concert hall had been taken over by Ziggy Marley and his band. The air vents had been opened for the warm summer night, so the strains of reggae wafted from the auditorium across the landscaped grounds, accompanied by a sweet miasma of legalized marijuana from hundreds of Boulderites picnicking and sipping wine beneath the stars.In the spirit of improving both mind and body, I went hiking the next morning with Carol Taylor, a local historian, newspaper columnist and program manager for the Chautauqua. We followed a trail into the Flatirons, soaring triangular crags that were named for their resemblance to Victorian-era clothing irons. As sweat-soaked fitness devotees jogged past lugging backpacks filled with rocks, Ms. Taylor engaged me in a mobile history lecture, explaining that Boulder\u2019s current status as a perpetual contender for \u201cAmerica\u2019s most livable town\u201d was the result of a century and a half\u2019s worth of efforts to imbue its idyllic setting with intellectual cachet.Boulderites gave land and cash in the 1870s to establish the University of Colorado, then donated Chautauqua\u2019s choice site to lure creative celebrities. In 1908, they even hired the renowned landscaper Frederick Law Olmsted Jr., son of the designer of Central Park in New York, for aesthetic advice. He recommended they plant more trees \u2014 the mountains were barren then \u2014 and clean the refuse-strewn Boulder Creek.Soon after, a boosterish collection of poems by William O. Wise, \u201cBoulder the Beautiful,\u201d complete with promotional photos of the area, anointed Boulder the \u201cAthens of the West,\u201d a cultural beacon for the Rockies. (The lofty title has also been claimed by several other cities, including Cleveland and Louisville, Ky.).\u201cCan you imagine if this place was concreted over?\u201d Ms. Taylor mused as we took in the fairy-tale beauty of the valley, carpeted with colored wildflowers and exploding with clouds of butterflies.I decided to settle into a regimen. Like genteel Edwardian travelers of a century ago, I cleared my city lungs every morning with a wilderness jaunt \u2014 one day mountain biking the Switzerland Trail, a 20-mile former railroad track through gold mining ghost towns; the next day inner-tubing down Boulder Creek. Then, in the heat of the afternoon, I sought out the cultural attractions, following the advice of writers who congregate here, creating their own literary enclave in the West.It\u2019s hard to remember that until the late 1960s, Boulder was still a sober, conservative and pious place. (It remained \u201cdry\u201d until 1967.) Its image changed almost overnight when university students became radicalized, hippies and antinuclear demonstrators arrived from around the country, and a progressive City Council voted in the town\u2019s first (and last) African-American mayor. Suddenly, Boulder was a countercultural mecca.But the most intimate shrine turned out to be Ginsberg\u2019s long-term residence, which I tracked down in the quiet back blocks of the town. Stone steps led up from a sleepy lane to a quaint cottage with a \u201cBernie for President\u201d sign in the window. The current owners, Steve and Jennifer Hendricks, welcomed me in for iced tea.They admitted that they had known nothing of Ginsberg\u2019s life here before moving in five years ago. \u201cWe do get a few poetry fans every year,\u201d Mr. Hendricks said. \u201cNot many.\u201d The interior of the house had been renovated, they said, but its exterior has barely changed since the glory days. As proof, Mr. Hendricks pulled up on his laptop a snapshot of Ginsberg with friends gathered on the porch, including Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Peter Orlovsky and Burroughs.\u201cWhat worries us is that property prices are so high now in Boulder, the new arrivals are going to be more mainstream,\u201d Ms. Hendricks mused. \u201cIt changes the atmosphere.\u201d\u201cThey won\u2019t have \u2018Bernie for President\u2019 signs in their windows,\u201d Mr. Hendricks added.I.T. specialists, professionals and retirees are descending on the town, squeezing out the more chilled-out \u2014 and impecunious \u2014 population. Last year, Google broke ground on an office with room for 1,500 employees, which threatens to force even more locals out.\u201cBoulder is actually becoming more artistic every year,\u201d Ms. DiDomenico said, as we clambered through one of the magical refuges. \u201cArtists have been working here for decades, only now we\u2019re getting some attention.\u201dBy now the sun was sinking, so I drove up to the Flatirons and pulled on my hiking boots. Within an hour, I was up at a spectacular rock formation called the Arch with a cadre of sweaty fitness fans, watching the sun turn the mountains blood red. Allen Ginsberg would surely have been enraptured.A picture caption on Sept. 4 with an article about Boulder, Colo., described a house in the city incorrectly. The house was the setting of the \u201cMork and Mindy\u201d TV show, not the residence of the poet Allen Ginsberg.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Daily Report: The Message From Snapchat", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsSnapchat is famous for its disappearing messages. Its financial success, however, may prove a very durable message.The mobile messaging company grew up in the wake of Google, which collected data based on internet search behavior to offer ads based on your queries. It came after Facebook, which collected data based on your social behavior to intuit interests and affect your buying behavior.This may be in the form of a geofilter, which enables a Snapchat user to pick up a \u201csticker\u201d from a certain location, or a lens, which is often something product-related that a person can incorporate into an image of themselves.Pok\u00e9mon Go is getting a lot of attention as the first mass use of augmented reality, but maybe that credit should go to Snapchat. People are combining their own faces with Taco Bell tacos or X-Men Wolverines, and then distributing these augmented objects to their friends. People are stumbling into locations and obtaining commercial images that say what they are consuming, so they can pass them around.Snapchat is not following you, at least not in this part of its business; it is counting on you to follow other things. And, at least when it comes to the taco transformation, it is counting on the bottomless modern desire to make things ironic \u2014 unless for so many there is beauty in seeming like a popular Mexican fast food.Considering that almost half of America\u2019s 18-to-34-year-olds open Snapchat every day, it\u2019s almost certainly the desire for the casually comical. That is the demographic advertisers crave, since consumption and brand loyalty are not yet fixed in the age group.When you think about it, this is a powerful development. Instead of Google- and Facebook-type offers for stuff people can accrue, Snapchat is offering ways we can pour ourselves into a product and share the personalized outcome with other consumers.Is there enough appetite for this kind of comic yet sincere interaction for Snapchat to earn its current valuation of $19 billion? Or do we burn out on it?That sounds a little like a \u201chow high is up?\u201d question. A casual look at our entertainment choices indicates that the appetite for celebrating ourselves and our products is unquenchable.All this, and the scale of Snapchat\u2019s ambitions, raises valid questions of what else it might need to figure out, in addition to selling (apparently for much less net revenue) the regular ads it offers on its space.Advertisement"}

After all, one\u2019s friends tend to share one\u2019s political biases. Facebook likes sharing because it builds loyalty to Facebook.Sharing, to Facebook, is a way that you build your personal brand, a statement of ego that is likely to keep you on the site longer. That is why Facebook\u2019s computers watch what you do on the site. It wants to know what kind of stories to put in front of you, so you will read and share them.On one hand, this is a nice service: You get the kind of news you seem to enjoy reading, which speaks to your worldview. On the other hand, this impedes encountering views unlike yours.Approaching difference with empathy is at the heart of democracy, so the more our own views are endorsed by algorithms, the worse off democracy is. Look no further than the incomprehension and contempt with which many on both sides view each other in the current election season.Of course, this existed long before Facebook. Talk radio and cable news enabled a range of viewpoints, and the biggest networks run programs that endorse a worldview of the right or the left. Direct marketing isolates us too, with lifestyle promises targeted to the people in our ZIP code.Online life took this to a whole new level, with Google-type ad targeting that is as personal as an individual\u2019s search and shopping choices.The latest advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence may compound the problem. These are statistical systems with narrow aims: If it turns out you like something, you\u2019ll get more of it, which you may like and share, ensuring you\u2019ll get more of it.Somebody could build a recommendation engine intended to foster a sympathetic view of others\u2019 lives and values.

Its financial success, however, may prove a very durable message.The mobile messaging company grew up in the wake of Google, which collected data based on internet search behavior to offer ads based on your queries. It came after Facebook, which collected data based on your social behavior to intuit interests and affect your buying behavior.This may be in the form of a geofilter, which enables a Snapchat user to pick up a \u201csticker\u201d from a certain location, or a lens, which is often something product-related that a person can incorporate into an image of themselves.Pok\u00e9mon Go is getting a lot of attention as the first mass use of augmented reality, but maybe that credit should go to Snapchat. People are combining their own faces with Taco Bell tacos or X-Men Wolverines, and then distributing these augmented objects to their friends. People are stumbling into locations and obtaining commercial images that say what they are consuming, so they can pass them around.Snapchat is not following you, at least not in this part of its business; it is counting on you to follow other things. And, at least when it comes to the taco transformation, it is counting on the bottomless modern desire to make things ironic \u2014 unless for so many there is beauty in seeming like a popular Mexican fast food.Considering that almost half of America\u2019s 18-to-34-year-olds open Snapchat every day, it\u2019s almost certainly the desire for the casually comical. That is the demographic advertisers crave, since consumption and brand loyalty are not yet fixed in the age group.When you think about it, this is a powerful development. Instead of Google- and Facebook-type offers for stuff people can accrue, Snapchat is offering ways we can pour ourselves into a product and share the personalized outcome with other consumers.Is there enough appetite for this kind of comic yet sincere interaction for Snapchat to earn its current valuation of $19 billion? Or do we burn out on it?That sounds a little like a \u201chow high is up?\u201d question. A casual look at our entertainment choices indicates that the appetite for celebrating ourselves and our products is unquenchable.All this, and the scale of Snapchat\u2019s ambitions, raises valid questions of what else it might need to figure out, in addition to selling (apparently for much less net revenue) the regular ads it offers on its space.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Florida Company Gets Approval to Put Robotic Lander on Moon", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA small start-up has received the green light from the federal government to do something that NASA has not done for more than four decades: land on the moon.Moon Express has a ways to go before it can reach the lunar surface, which it hopes to do next year. It still has to assemble the lander. The rocket that it plans to launch on has yet to fly even once.And one of its competitors could beat it to the moon, and the $20 million.The approval reflects an effort to encourage 21st-century commercial space endeavors while staying within an international space treaty written 49 years ago when outer space was a rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, and the idea of a start-up going to the moon an unlikely fantasy.The Juno spacecraft has reached Jupiter. Here are some other spacecraft exploring our solar system, launched by NASA and the world\u2019s other space agencies.In the bubbly optimism that followed, the X Prize Foundation enlisted Google to finance reaching the loftier target of the moon. The Google Lunar X Prize, announced in 2007, called for putting a spacecraft on the moon that would be able to send back video and images and also move more than 500 meters. The first team to achieve that would claim $20 million; second place would be rewarded with $5 million.For John Noble Wilford, the reporter who covered the moon landing for The New York Times from mission control in Houston, the memory is invigorating.As Moon Express worked on its MX-1 lander, company officials realized that they had other hurdles: paperwork and international treaties.The United States fought to include that clause, rejecting the Soviet view that space exploration should be limited to governments, said Matthew Schaefer, the director of the space, cyber and telecommunications law program at the University of Nebraska.While the American negotiators did not necessarily foresee a company like Moon Express, \u201cthe U.S. government wanted to keep that option open,\u201d Professor Schaefer said.Nonetheless, that would have been a roadblock, said Dr. Richards, Moon Express\u2019s chief executive, because the United States did not have any procedures for authorizing and supervising what companies like Moon Express want to do.\u201cAny application to the U.S. government would have been vetoed by the State Department, due to the lack of regulatory frameworks that would allow the U.S. government to remain in compliance with the Outer Space Treaty,\u201d he said.Moon Express has now employed this payload review process for its lunar trip. The F.A.A. sent its approval on July 20, the 47th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing on the moon.Mr. Jain said that low-cost missions to the moon \u2014 under $10 million \u2014 would transform space exploration. But the company has revealed little about its customers and much of the hoped-for business like the mining of platinum and helium-3 is speculative. (The helium-3 would be for fusion power plants that do not yet exist.)At present, there is little worry that the moonscape is about to be scarred by a commercial onslaught. The MX-1 is about the size of a coffee table, and NASA has left far more litter on the moon, most recently crashing its Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer into the far side of the moon in 2014.Of more concern is the preservation of earlier artifacts like the Apollo landing sites, especially as the Lunar X Prize offers a $4 million bonus for broadcasting video from one of those sites.Moon Express said that it had not yet decided on a landing site, but that it would defer to NASA\u2019s wishes and stay away from the Apollo sites.Mr. Jain said the greatest opportunities were the ones not yet imagined, just as Apple, when it created the iPhone, did not foresee the explosion of apps that would run on the device.\u201cMore importantly,\u201d Mr. Jain said, \u201cwe don\u2019t know what the Pok\u00e9mon Go of the moon is going to be.\u201dAn earlier version of this article gave an outdated location for the headquarters of Moon Express. The company is now based in Cape Canaveral, Fla., not Mountain View, Calif. The error was repeated in the headline.Advertisement"}

Sometimes a deep question is better than a straight answer. I think we should start to develop deep questions of what we are doing here with the internet and what the internet is doing on its own.

{"Headline": "Uber Aims for an Edge in the Race for a Self-Driving Future", "Date": "2016-08-18", "News": "Supported byA world in which cars drive themselves may come sooner than once thought.On Thursday, Uber said that it would begin testing self-driving cars in Pittsburgh in a matter of weeks, allowing people in the city to hail modified versions of Volvo sport utility vehicles to get around the city.Uber also said it had acquired Otto, a 90-person start-up including former Google and Carnegie Mellon engineers that is focused on developing self-driving truck technology to upend the shipping industry.Those moves are the most recent indications of Uber\u2019s ambitions for autonomous vehicles that can provide services to both consumers and businesses.Suddenly, it seems, both Silicon Valley and Detroit are doubling down on their bets for autonomous vehicles. And in what could emerge as a self-driving-car arms race, the players are investing in, or partnering with, or buying outright the specialty companies most focused on the requisite hardware, software and artificial intelligence capabilities.Despite their multitude of sensors and processors, autonomous cars have a lot of trouble with some everyday aspects of driving.\u201cIt appears 2016 will go down in history as the year of the autonomous vehicle partnership,\u201d said Karl Brauer, an analyst with the auto research firm Kelley Blue Book.But the Ford and Uber initiatives are not without risk. Federal auto safety regulators are preparing guidelines for autonomous vehicles that may or may not include the need for a steering wheel or require the presence of a driver who can step in should computerized systems falter.In a nod to the highly experimental nature of its Pittsburgh plan, Uber intends to have an actual human being behind the wheel \u2014 just in case. But while Ford is looking five years out, Uber is moving aggressively toward driverless fleets, despite the regulatory uncertainties.\u201cThere\u2019s an urgency to our mission about being part of the future,\u201d Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s chief executive, said on Thursday in an interview. \u201cThis is not a side project. This is existential for us.\u201dThat explains Uber\u2019s other announcement on Thursday \u2014 its deal to buy Otto for undisclosed terms, to beef up its own in-house expertise in self-driving technology.The acquisition of Otto follows Uber\u2019s recent opening of an advanced technology center in Pittsburgh, in conjunction with Carnegie Mellon University. The company has also hired engineers directly away from Google, which has been immersed in developing autonomous cars for a decade.Like Uber, Google is intent on developing self-driving cars for urban taxi use \u2014 reasoning that the slow speeds and relatively predictable environment of city streets that can be thoroughly, digitally mapped is the best and safest near-term purpose of autonomous vehicles. But for Uber, such cars are not a side bet but a way to be more fully in control of its business by eliminating the need for drivers who expect to be paid.\u201cUber arguably has more at stake in creating self-driving cars than any other automotive entity,\u201d Mr. Brauer said.Although the market for big sales of fully self-driving cars is still years away, the investment and research activities are on a fast track.Uber plans to open a 180,000-square-foot facility in Palo Alto, Calif., to house Otto, which will operate as a stand-alone company focused specifically on upending the long-distance trucking industry. Otto engineers will also work out of offices in San Francisco and Pittsburgh.But that talent and technology will apply more broadly to the technology behind Uber\u2019s grander self-driving car efforts, Mr. Kalanick said. He said he believed that his company\u2019s approach \u2014 a combination of teaming up with hardware manufacturers, Otto\u2019s software expertise and a large network of more than 50 million monthly riders as recently as July \u2014 places Uber in the best position to be competitive with companies like Google.\u201cThe first company in the space is not always the winner,\u201d Anthony Levandowski, chief executive of Otto, said on Thursday. \u201cIntel was not the first chip maker. Facebook wasn\u2019t the first social network.\u201dThe self-driving revolution has already hit a few speed bumps, in vehicles that are not fully autonomous but employ some elements of the technology. The electric-car maker Tesla is under investigation by federal regulators looking into a fatal crash in May of a Tesla Model S sedan whose driver had the vehicle\u2019s Autopilot assisted-driving system engaged.After Joshua Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio, was killed driving a Tesla Model S in the first fatality involving a self-driving car, questions have arisen about the safety of the car\u2019s technology.The German automaker Daimler was forced recently to pull an advertisement in the United States that possibly overstated the safety of assisted-driving options in a new Mercedes-Benz model.And Google is continuously explaining how minor accidents are occurring in self-driving vehicles it has been testing for some time in California.But potential safety concerns have hardly slowed the pace of research and investment by G.M., Ford and others. In Uber\u2019s case, Mr. Kalanick said he was confident that government officials would approve self-driving vehicles once the industry proves their effectiveness in real-world conditions.\u201cRegulators are going to optimistically make it work, while making it safer for the whole community,\u201d he said.In the Pittsburgh pilot program, Uber plans not only to have human drivers aboard as a safety precaution. Passengers who use the vehicles will have to \u201copt in\u201d and agree to be participants in the road test before riding, according to Uber.G.M. and Lyft are also planning their own testing program for autonomous ride-hailing vehicles, although they have not disclosed details.That plan, along with this week\u2019s announcements by Uber and Ford make clear that the initial market for robotic cars will likely be for commercial fleets rather than vehicles consumers would park in their own garages.Industry analysts see ride-hailing firms and delivery businesses as natural customers for the first autonomous vehicles, in part because the cars and trucks are expected to carry high price tags.Ford officials said this week that ride-hailing services are able to generate the passenger revenues needed to cover the high cost of the cars.Raj Nair, Ford\u2019s global product development chief, said that eliminating human drivers would drastically lower the cost of a ride-hailing fare. By catering to those companies, Ford expects to build a small, but profitable business segment.Ford has not said how many self-driving vehicles it expects to produce on an annual basis, or whether it would adapt one of its current models or build an entirely new vehicle.But the company\u2019s chief executive, Mark Fields, pledged that the vehicles would \u201cbring mobility to millions of people\u201d who do not own cars themselves. And doing so will create a \u201cvery good business\u201d for Ford.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Becomes a Green Energy Supplier, With Itself as Customer", "Date": "2016-08-23", "News": "Supported byPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 The words are stenciled on the front of the Apple Store, a glass box sandwiched between a nondescript Thai restaurant and a CVS pharmacy in downtown Palo Alto: \u201cThis store runs on 100 percent renewable energy.\u201dIf Apple\u2019s plans play out, it will be able to make that claim not only for its operations throughout California but also beyond, as the company aims to meet its growing needs for electricity with green sources like solar, wind and hydroelectric power.Like other big companies before it, including Walmart and Google, Apple recently received a federal designation for its energy subsidiary that allows it to become a wholesale seller of electricity from coast to coast. In effect, Apple is creating its own green utility company, although the main customer is itself.The motives may be economic as much as they are environmental. As a wholesaler, Apple could reduce the cost of its electricity load, which reached 831 million kilowatt-hours in the last fiscal year \u2014 enough to power about 76,000 homes for a year. But like a growing number of corporations, Apple is intent on reducing carbon dioxide emissions from electricity production \u2014 one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.In one ambitious venture, Apple has contracted with First Solar to begin buying a little less than half of the power later this year from California Flats, a solar energy farm now under construction. Under the terms of the deal, Apple will pay $848 million for the electricity over 25 years and receive the farm\u2019s total output by the end of the agreement. It is one of largest commercial clean energy contracts yet.Lisa Jackson, the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency who is now the Apple executive overseeing environmental policy, social initiatives and worldwide government affairs, said she hoped Apple could serve as a model for the many other big corporate power users that are now embracing clean energy.\u201cThis is just another sort of innovative way to get that power onto the grid so we don\u2019t have to take the California grid-mix default, which still includes fossil fuel,\u201d Ms. Jackson said.Although much of Apple\u2019s manufacturing is done offshore, it still has extensive needs for electric power in the United States \u2014 and not only for the sprawling new corporate campus it is building at its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., and its 270 retail stores around the country.One of Apple\u2019s biggest demands for electricity comes from operating the computing cloud through which it sells apps, music and videos to users of its iPhones, iPads and Mac computers.Apple\u2019s move comes as prices for renewable energy continue to plummet. And signing long-term contracts allows businesses to shield themselves from potentially higher, more volatile charges from a power company. Apple would not say how much it was paying for California Flats\u2019s energy, but Ms. Jackson said last year at a Wall Street Journal conference that it was less than what it paid for commercial power. She said she expected the company to save hundreds of millions of dollars over the life of the contract.Google, which received its federal energy wholesale designation from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 2010, is a big proponent of the approach Apple is now taking.\u201cRunning any kind of business, having predictability in terms of your operating costs can be very important,\u201d said Gary Demasi, director of operations for data center energy and location strategy at Google, which has been a leading investor in and user of clean energy. \u201cRenewable energy, from a cost perspective, is now competitive with other forms of energy, much more so than it was a few years ago.\u201dExecutives face greater pressure from shareholders and customers to show that they are doing their part to fight climate change. At the same time, corporate energy use has exploded, driven in many cases by the ravenous demands of the data cloud.\u201cWe are all becoming very large energy players, and this is a shift,\u201d said Brian Janous, director of energy strategy at Microsoft. \u201cEnergy is not something that Microsoft or Amazon or Google really ever had to think much about prior to the advent of the cloud.\u201dElectric utilities have begun to respond by creating products and services to meet the corporate demand for clean energy, said Letha Tawney, the World Resources Institute\u2019s director of utility innovation.One such product is a green tariff. It was pioneered in North Carolina by Duke Energy and is now under consideration in about a dozen states. It allows companies to designate that they are paying for a renewable energy supply.Another is a synthetic or virtual power purchase agreement, under which companies contract to buy the output of a clean power plant, as Apple is doing with California Flats.Although the companies say these arrangements mean they are running their businesses on renewable energy, in reality the clean power often does not flow directly to their facilities. They typically buy the renewable energy in amounts to match what they draw from the grid \u2014 a system of swaps that Ms. Jackson of Apple likened to using an A.T.M.\u201cThe dollar you deposit in the bank might not be the exact same bill that you get out,\u201d she said.Robert F. Shapiro, a partner at the law firm Chadbourne & Parke who focuses on project finance and energy, describes it as meaningful symbolism.\u201cThey\u2019re actually getting power from their local utility, which may be coal,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cBut they\u2019re deemed to have put into the world carbon-neutral energy, which they are deemed to have used for their load.\u201dTo keep track of the clean energy credits, power generators work with registries to issue numbered certificates.\u201cThe power flows into the grid. The electrons go where they go,\u201d Ms. Tawney said. \u201cBut because there\u2019s a renewable-energy certificate, no one else can claim the same zero-carbon benefit.\u201dSuch complexities are necessary, executives and clean energy advocates say, because it is not often feasible to install enough renewable-power generators at corporate sites to meet companies\u2019 full energy needs.Walmart, despite having installed solar panels, wind turbines and fuel cells at stores and distribution centers, can nonetheless meet only about a third of those operations\u2019 energy needs. So it also buys renewable energy from generators and utilities, said David Ozment, director of energy at Walmart stores.Procter & Gamble, another member of the energy buyers\u2019 alliance, has arranged to purchase all of the steam from a biomass generator under construction at a plant in Georgia where it makes Charmin toilet paper and Bounty paper towels, said Jack McAneny, the company\u2019s director of sustainability.But that was possible, he said, only because of the plant\u2019s location near a source of waste wood and pulp for fuel and the cooperation of P&G\u2019s partners. Among those partners are the local utility, Georgia Power, which will buy the electricity from the generator for its customers from Constellation, the company that developed and will own and operate the generator.At Apple, where the purchase or production of renewable energy has more than tripled since 2012, the company would prefer to not have to go to great lengths to ensure a clean energy supply, Ms. Jackson said. But the public energy grid is simply still too dependent on carbon-based fuels to make that possible.\u201cIf we had our preference, we\u2019d just be able to say, \u2018We want 100 percent green power everywhere we use power,\u2019\u201d Ms. Jackson said. \u201cThe best would be if we could run every one of our stores, every one of our data centers, every office complex, every building we have, on 100 percent renewable \u2014 and if we didn\u2019t have to spend a whole bunch of our time and energy figuring out how to get that done.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Arianna Huffington Is Leaving Huffington Post", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "Supported bySince it started 11 years ago, The Huffington Post has been synonymous with the personality and the interests of its co-founder, Arianna Huffington.The pioneering web publication, known for its aggressive use of aggregation and an unapologetically liberal worldview, would go on to win a Pulitzer Prize and expand globally during a challenging time for all media organizations.But over the last year, The Huffington Post has found itself an increasingly small part of an increasingly large media and tech conglomerate. When Verizon, which announced it had purchased The Huffington Post\u2019s parent company, AOL, in May 2015, bought Yahoo\u2019s internet business last month, Ms. Huffington\u2019s perch at the company seemed increasingly precarious.With her abrupt announcement on Thursday that she was stepping down as editor in chief of The Huffington Post and leaving the company to focus on her new venture, a health and wellness start-up called Thrive Global, she leaves the publication in an unfamiliar position. For the first time since its founding in 2005, The Huffington Post will be without Ms. Huffington. No successor was named.In an interview, Ms. Huffington, 66, said she had originally intended to run The Huffington Post while working to start Thrive Global. But that plan soon reached its limits.\u201cThe original idea was that I could do both,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it very quickly turned out to be an illusion.\u201dAlong with her success, Ms. Huffington has been a polarizing figure in the media world, and her presence in the newsroom has not always been constant. But since Verizon bought AOL, her interests seemed to increasingly move beyond running The Huffington Post. After the sale, there was speculation that she would leave the company, concerns allayed when she signed a four-year contract in June 2015.Other moves have generated misgivings in the newsroom. The publication\u2019s decision last summer to put articles about Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign in its entertainment section and a later decision to add an editor\u2019s note calling Mr. Trump a \u201cserial liar\u201d and a \u201cracist\u201d to any article about him raised questions about whether Ms. Huffington was unduly influencing coverage to suit her political agenda.In April, the announcement that she was joining Uber\u2019s board rankled employees who feared inherent conflicts of interest in coverage. (She said she would recuse herself from being involved with any coverage of the company.) The publication has also been criticized for what some see as excessive coverage of sleep and wellness, topics on which Ms. Huffington has written books.At the same time, staff attrition, evidenced by a flurry of goodbye emails over the last year, has taken a toll on morale. In that context, Ms. Huffington\u2019s decision to leave surprised an already anxious newsroom.At a staff meeting Thursday morning in The Huffington Post\u2019s Manhattan headquarters, Ms. Huffington stressed her confidence in the organization. \u201cGreat companies always succeed beyond their founder,\u201d she said, according to an article by Michael Calderone, the publication\u2019s media reporter. \u201cEven though HuffPost bears my name, it is absolutely about all of you and about this amazing team we\u2019ve been for over 11 years.\u201dTim Armstrong, the chief executive of AOL, was not present. But in a statement, he called Ms. Huffington a \u201cvisionary who built The Huffington Post into a truly transformative news platform.\u201d\u201cToday, The Huffington Post is a firmly established and celebrated news source, and AOL and Verizon are committed to continuing its growth and the groundbreaking work Arianna pioneered,\u201d he added.When The Huffington Post was founded, there was no Twitter, and Facebook was still a relatively fledgling online platform primarily used by college students. Initially, the idea was to create an aggregation site that would be a liberal counterpart to the Drudge Report. Ms. Huffington, who had recently run for governor of California, said at the time that she had signed up more than 250 of \u201cthe most creative minds\u201d in the country, including Walter Cronkite, Nora Ephron and Norman Mailer, to write a group blog on topics including politics and entertainment.The Huffington Post did not just take the internet seriously; it ruthlessly embraced as opportunities trends that established media companies perceived as threats. The company demonstrated early and continued mastery over Google, capturing audiences through search with carefully engineered headlines and fast aggregation. The publication consistently outranked its competitors in search, often with blog posts based on its competitors\u2019 work. But while the strategy proved successful, the site\u2019s ability to package articles from other publications also prompted criticism, and many in the media world accused it of aggregation excesses that bordered on intellectual theft.Over the years, however, it has pushed aggressively to produce more original content. The site also published articles by non-journalists, who often contributed without being paid.AOL purchased the publication for $315 million in 2011 and Ms. Huffington assumed control of AOL\u2019s editorial content. The Huffington Post won a Pulitzer Prize in 2012 for a series on wounded veterans.Ms. Huffington\u2019s relationship with Mr. Armstrong was rocky almost from the start, several current and former employees said, and some said her outside interests kept her out of the newsroom for extended periods.When AOL sold itself to Verizon for $4.4 billion, there was speculation that Ms. Huffington might leave. She had become an increasingly powerful force in her own right: She has published several books on health and wellness, including \u201cThrive\u201d and \u201cThe Sleep Revolution,\u201d and she has become a champion of the benefits of a good night\u2019s sleep.Though Ms. Huffington\u2019s departure came as a shock, it was in some ways inevitable, particularly after she announced the formation of Thrive Global in June.In the interview, Ms. Huffington said she had thought about leaving The Huffington Post for \u201ca while,\u201d and the closing of a funding round for Thrive Global last week ultimately drove her move. \u201cIt was my decision\u201d to leave, she said, adding that the contract she signed last year had a carve-out clause that allowed her to start a new venture.Ms. Huffington said she would stay on at the publication until early September.\u201cI\u2019m going to be very much around for the rest of the month, helping in every way I can, including having Greek sweets in my office,\u201d she said, a nod to her home country and her distinctive accent.Mr. Armstrong said in a note to staff that the company had formed an interim editorial committee that would act in Ms. Huffington\u2019s place. The committee will also be involved in what Mr. Armstrong described as \u201can ongoing search\u201d for a new editor in chief.In a separate note to employees, Jared Grusd, the chief executive of The Huffington Post, called Thursday a \u201cday of change.\u201d\u201cToday,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis the first day of the next chapter in HuffPost\u2019s history.\u201dJohn Herrman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Once a Bucknell Professor, Now the Commander of an Ethiopian Rebel Army", "Date": "2016-08-31", "News": "FeatureWhy Berhanu Nega traded a tenured position for the chance to lead a revolutionary force against an oppressive regime.Supported byNega remained vague about his past. But students curious enough to Google him would discover that the man who stood before them, outlining development policies in sub-Saharan Africa, was in fact intimately involved in the long-running hostility between Ethiopia and neighboring Eritrea, a conflict that has dragged on for half a century. By the start of the millennium, its newest incarnation, a border war over a patch of seemingly worthless ground just 250 square miles in size, devolved into a tense standoff, with the two nations each massing along the border thousands of troops from both official and unofficial armies. One proxy army fighting on the Eritrean side, a group of disaffected Ethiopians called Ginbot 7, was a force that Nega helped create, founding the movement in 2008 with another Ethiopian exile, Andargachew Tsege, in Washington. The Ethiopian government, which had previously detained Nega as a political prisoner for two years in Addis Ababa, now sentenced him to death in absentia. Bucknell students who did learn about their teacher\u2019s past were thrilled. \u201cIt made his classes exciting,\u201d Rickard says.In Ginbot 7, Tsege served as the political leader based in Eritrea; Nega was the group\u2019s intellectual leader and principal fund-raiser, collecting money from members of the Ethiopian diaspora in Europe and the United States. That all changed one day in June 2014, when Tsege, known to everyone as Andy, made a brief stopover in Sanaa, the capital of Yemen, on his way to Asmara, the capital of Eritrea. As he sat in the airport transit lounge, waiting to board his flight, Yemeni security forces, apparently acting in collusion with Ethiopian intelligence, arrested him and put him on a plane to Addis Ababa, where he was paraded on state television and currently faces a death sentence.Days after Tsege\u2019s arrest and extradition, Nega volunteered to replace him in Eritrea. \u201cWas I going to remain an academic, sitting in an ivory tower criticizing things?\u201d he told me. \u201cOr was I going to do something as an engaged citizen?\u201d Nega put his house up for sale and took an indefinite leave of absence from the university. It was an extended sabbatical, he told his colleagues. Only a handful of close friends, his wife and his two sons knew the truth.\u201cThey\u2019ve got documents, and they insist on handing them over only to me,\u201d Nega told me. \u201cWhen there is sensitive material, they first want me to see it and then filter the information to the rest of the organization.\u201d Nega, a burly, balding 58-year-old with a rumpled facade and an appealingly unassuming manner, rubbed his forehead as the lights flickered and then returned. In recent years, Ginbot 7 has grown, and it is now guided by an 80-member council of representatives spread around the world. As commander, Nega oversees several hundred rebel fighters in Eritrea as well as an unknown number of armed members inside Ethiopia who carry out occasional attacks in the movement\u2019s name. During his frequent visits to the front lines, he spends his time meeting with fellow commanders, observing training and \u2014 ever the professor \u2014 leading history and democracy seminars using chalk and a blackboard in a \u201cclassroom\u201d in the bush.Nega turned back to the map and traced a straight line leading to the Tekeze River, the westernmost border between Ethiopia and Eritrea. The stream was a main crossing point for Ethiopian Army deserters fleeing to the rebels, and in recent weeks it had come under threat from advancing Ethiopian troops. \u201cThey are moving a sizable force into this area, because we are their main target now,\u201d he said, referring to Ginbot 7, now known as Patriotic Ginbot 7. \u201cAnd they are pushing a large part of their army, artillery and tanks into this zone. They haven\u2019t started shelling us yet.\u201dThe two nations, now ferocious enemies, were once joined. Eritrea, an Italian colony from 1890 until 1941, was annexed by Ethiopia after World War II; it took a three-decades-long war for the Eritreans to finally liberate themselves, in 1991. The neighbors remained at peace until 1998, when a simmering dispute over the Yirga triangle, a piece of rocky land along the border that had never been clearly demarcated in colonial maps, exploded into two years of tank and trench warfare in which 100,000 died. Today, despite a United Nations-supervised mediation that awarded the disputed territory to Eritrea, Ethiopia continues to occupy the border village Badame. Tens of thousands of troops face each other across a landscape of mines, bunkers, sniper posts and other fortifications.Violence on the border, while infrequent, can be both sudden and brutal. In mid-June, according to the Eritrean government, Ethiopia launched a full-scale attack along the frontier at Tsorona, the first major incursion since 2012, possibly in retaliation for attacks on its forces by Ginbot 7. Eritrea claimed that it had killed 200 enemy soldiers and wounded 300, though Ethiopia downplayed its losses. \u201cThey almost always deny it,\u201d Nega told me. \u201cAs far as the Ethiopian government is concerned, nobody ever dies.\u201dEthiopia, while an American ally and an economic leader by African standards, is notoriously repressive. The minority Tigrayan regime has jailed hundreds of bloggers, journalists and opposition figures, keeping itself in power by intimidating political opponents, rigging elections and violently putting down protests. Since November of last year, according to Human Rights Watch, state security forces killed more than 400 protesters in the Oromia region, which surrounds Addis Ababa. Protests have recently spread to the Amhara region, as well; in August, security forces shot dead roughly 100 demonstrators and injured hundreds more. Thousands of Oromos, a minority group that makes up about a third of the population, have been jailed without trial on suspicion of supporting the Oromo Liberation Front, a secessionist group. The Ethiopian marathoner Feyisa Lilesa, who won the silver medal at the Olympics this year, drew global attention to the government\u2019s abuses when he held his crossed arms over his head at the finish line in solidarity with his fellow Oromos; he says he fears returning home and is seeking political asylum.The house also serves as an infirmary for rebels who become ill or are wounded in combat, and it provides a temporary sanctuary for Ethiopian Army defectors who cross the front lines. One recent arrival was a former Ethiopian Air Force officer, an Oromo who had traveled north 42 hours by bus and on foot, then swum across the Tekeze River to Eritrea. He made the decision to defect while sitting in an Addis Ababa jail cell on \u201cfalse charges,\u201d he told me, of being a member of the Oromo secessionist movement.\u201cWe have many like him,\u201d Nega said.Nega put on his jacket to head off in search of diesel fuel for the morning journey to the border. With another rebel comrade from Virginia, we drove down the deserted, lightless streets of Asmara, searching for an open filling station, but the one we found had run out of diesel; Nega would have to return the next morning, delaying his departure for the front lines. When we returned to his home, Nega pointed to a pile of medical supplies in the hallway \u2014 bandages, splints, antibiotics, antimalarials \u2014 that he was planning to ferry to his fighters, and three cardboard boxes packed with solar cells that would provide some rudimentary electricity in the bush. While in the camps, Nega was dependent on his mobile phone for contact with the outside world, but even that was not guaranteed. \u201cThey have shut off phone coverage since the incursion\u201d by the Ethiopians at Tsorona, he told me. \u201cI\u2019ll be out of touch for days.\u201dWe met over Memorial Day weekend on the terrace of the upscale Caf\u00e9 Dupont on Dupont Circle in Washington, joined by his sister Hiwot, who runs a technology start-up in New York, and Iyassu, a 21-year-old former high-school track star who was starting work at a New York investment bank in the fall. Over white wine and chicken salad, the conversation touched on Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s commencement address and Nega\u2019s excitement over crossing paths, after the ceremony, with Donald Trump and Vice President Joe Biden. (Trump\u2019s daughter and Biden\u2019s granddaughter were members of Iyassu\u2019s graduating class.) I asked Iyassu if he had reconciled himself to the idea of his father\u2019s new life on the front lines, and he said that he had. \u201cUltimately he should continue to pursue what he believes in,\u201d he told me. He expressed little interest, though, in visiting his father at his Eritrean rebel camp or delving deeper into the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the Ginbot 7 movement. \u201cI just got out of college \u2014 my life has its own direction,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t take time off. ... I\u2019m a little bit removed generationally as well.\u201dThe elder Nega is part of a generation of Ethiopians who grew up amid violence and tumult. Over lunch, he recalled what it was like to be a high-school student when a Marxist junta, the Soviet-backed Derg, overthrew Emperor Haile Selassie and ushered in a brutal dictatorship. Nega had grown up privileged, the son of a wealthy entrepreneur, and he watched as his father\u2019s vast commercial corn and soybean farms were seized and security forces began arresting, imprisoning and executing thousands of dissidents, including many students. He and his two older sisters joined a resistance movement called the Ethiopian People\u2019s Revolutionary Party (E.P.R.P.). They went underground, living in safe houses, eluding the police. His eldest sister was later captured and disappeared in the Derg\u2019s prisons. His family searched for her everywhere.\u201cWe had people coming to our house and telling my parents, \u2018I saw her at this place.\u2019 My mother used to go out all over looking for her,\u201d Nega recalls. Her former cellmates later told him that she had died in prison, probably by committing suicide with a cyanide capsule that she wore around her neck. \u201cIt was common to have cyanide with you because if you were caught, you would be tortured and executed, and through torture you might be forced to betray people,\u201d Nega said. As the crackdown in Addis intensified, the E.P.R.P. sent Nega north to Tigray province, the center of a growing guerrilla war against the Derg; there, he carried out attacks on government forces. In 1978 a power struggle erupted within the E.P.R.P. leadership, and Nega was thrown into prison. He was released one day before guards turned their guns on the remaining prisoners, killing 15. Nega escaped to Sudan, living as a refugee in Khartoum for nearly two years, then obtained political asylum in the United States in 1980.He earned his bachelor\u2019s degree from the State University of New York at New Paltz, where he also played on the soccer team. While studying for his doctorate at the New School for Social Research, he lived in Brooklyn and wrote his dissertation on the failures of Ethiopian agriculture under the Communist regime. Meanwhile, Ethiopia was sliding deeper into calamity. When the guerrilla movements increased their attacks in Tigray in the mid-1980s, the Derg dictator, Mengistu Haile Mariam, blocked food supplies to the region, creating a devastating famine in which one million people died. Photographs of starving children, disseminated by the news media, catalyzed an international relief effort, Live Aid, and inspired the pop hit \u201cWe Are the World,\u201d making Ethiopia a worldwide synonym for hunger. The famine had wound down, and the rebel war was escalating, when Bucknell hired Nega as an assistant professor in 1990. \u201cHe never trumpeted his background, the fact that he had been a guerrilla fighter,\u201d says Dean Baker, a former Bucknell colleague who now heads the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington.In 1991, after a decade\u2019s struggle, three rebel groups \u2014 the Tigrayan People\u2019s Liberation Front, the Oromo Liberation Front and the Eritrean People\u2019s Liberation Front \u2014 defeated the Derg and marched into Addis Ababa. The new government, led by the Tigrayan rebel leader Meles Zenawi, set about rebuilding the war-shattered nation. Nega finally had reason for optimism. He knew Meles well \u2014 the prime minister had been in the same university class as his dead sister \u2014 and after the Tigrayans consolidated power, Nega obtained a leave of absence from Bucknell and flew with his wife and two sons, both toddlers, back to Addis, determined to help rebuild the country. Nega believed that Meles \u201chad good intentions,\u201d he told me.But Nega\u2019s enthusiasm for the new government wore off quickly. At Addis Ababa University, where he taught part-time (he had also taken over several of his father\u2019s businesses), administrators cracked down on dissent, banning the student government and the school newspaper. When Nega encouraged his students to press for academic freedoms, police assaulted them and other demonstrators; later, as unrest spread through the city, they shot 41 people dead. Nega spent a month in jail for abetting the protests. \u201cAt night I was hearing prisoners being tortured, beaten,\u201d he says.In May 2005, with the economy growing rapidly and the government\u2019s popularity appar\u00adently high, Ethiopia held elections, the first truly multiparty vote in Ethiopia\u2019s history, and invited international observers to attend. But the results were not to Meles\u2019s liking. Nega\u2019s Coalition for Unity and Democracy won 137 of the 138 seats on the City Council in Addis Ababa. Nega was poised to become mayor, but the government denied his party the victory and jailed him along with other C.U.D. leaders. American colleagues began a campaign to free Nega. \u201cThe Bucknell faculty approved a motion to support him and call attention to his plight,\u201d Rickard says. \u201cWe talked with journalists, ambassadors, trying to make sure that he stayed on the front burner.\u201d International pressure helped to secure Nega\u2019s release after 21 months, and he returned to the United States. The experience \u201chardened him,\u201d says Samuel Adamassu, a member of the Ethio\u00adpian diaspora who has known Nega and his family since the 1980s. \u201cIt made him realize these people are not willing to change without being forced.\u201dWhen Nega helped found the Ginbot 7 movement in 2008, the year he returned to teaching at Bucknell, he explained that the movement would seek to \u201corganize civil disobedience and help the existing armed movements\u201d inside and outside Ethiopia and \u201cput pressure on the government, and the international community, to come to a negotiation.\u201d Yet the Ginbot 7 platform advocated destabilizing the government \u201cby any means necessary,\u201d including attacks on soldiers and police. It was a discordant message coming out of a liberal American university whose first class was held in the basement of the First Baptist Church of Lewisburg in 1846. \u201cIt\u2019s a line that he has crossed,\u201d says Rickard, the English professor, who finds Nega\u2019s advocacy of violence \u201ctroubling\u201d but understandable. \u201cHe has never been a pacifist, never renounced armed struggle,\u201d he says. \u201cHe has seen elections overturned, hundreds of people murdered on the streets. His sister died, and his best friend is in prison, in peril of his life. He sees violence as viable and necessary. It\u2019s kind of shocking, in a way.\u201dWhile Ginbot 7 started to foment its resistance, Ethiopia was busy rebranding itself as an economic success story. Following South Korean and Chinese models of state-directed development, Meles borrowed from state-owned banks and used Western aid money to invest heavily in dams, airlines, agriculture, education and health care. Ethiopia\u2019s economy took off, averaging nearly 11 percent growth per year for the last decade, one of the highest rates in Africa. Addis Ababa became the showpiece of the country\u2019s transformation, with a light rail system, ubiquitous high-rise construction and luxury hotels, high-end restaurants and wine bars packed with newly minted millionaires. At the same time, the country was becoming a bulwark against the spread of radical Islam in the Horn of Africa. Today Ethiopia provides 4,400 peacekeepers to an African Union force in Somalia and helps keep the peace along the tense border between North and South Sudan. In July 2015 President Obama, on an African tour, paid the first visit ever to Ethiopia by a sitting American president.Yet in the classroom and abroad, Nega argued that Ethiopia\u2019s transformation was a mirage, created to placate Western observers troubled by the lack of democracy. \u201cIn 2005, it became clear that legitimacy would not come through the political process, so they started this new narrative \u2014 development,\u201d he told me. Nega insists that Ethiopia has \u201ccooked the books,\u201d and that its growth rate is largely attributable to huge infrastructure projects and Western development aid, with little contribution from the private sector. \u201cThe World Bank is throwing money at Ethiopia like there\u2019s no tomorrow,\u201d he told me. The actual growth rate, he insists, is closer to 5 to 6 percent \u2014 per capita income is still among the lowest in the world \u2014 and the weakness of the country\u2019s institutions will mean that even this rate cannot be sustained.Two months before Obama arrived, the government presided over what was widely considered a sham election, in which the ruling party won all 547 seats in Parliament, But Obama, making it clear that security trumped other concerns in the Horn of Africa, stood beside Meles\u2019s successor, Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn, and described the government as being \u201cdemocratically elected.\u201d\u201cI was shocked,\u201d Nega told me. \u201c I understand the reality of power and why he supports the Ethiopian government, but to say it is \u2018democratically elected\u2019? I was disgusted.\u201dImmediately following its independence in the early 1990s, under the rebel-leader-turned-president Isaias Afwerki, Eritrea was briefly considered one of the hopes of Africa. When I visited the country in 1996, five years after it won its liberation from Ethiopia, the former rebels were starting to revive the wrecked economy \u2014 rebuilding roads, bridges and a railway to the coast, calling on the Eritrean diaspora to invest. But after the border war between 1998 and 2000, Eritrea\u2019s leadership turned inward, growing increasingly suspicious of the outside world. Afwerki suppressed dissent, expelled Western journalists and NGOs, turned down foreign aid, nationalized industries and discouraged foreign investment; according to the World Bank, per capita income is about $1,400 a year. In 2009 the United Nations Security Council imposed sanctions on Eritrea, including an arms em\u00adbargo and a travel ban and a freeze on the assets of top Eritrean officials, for providing weapons to the Shabab, the radical Islamist group that has carried out hundreds of terrorist attacks in Somalia and neighboring Kenya. (Eritrea called the allegation \u201cfabricated lies.\u201d) A June 2016 United Nations report accused the Eritrean government of committing \u201ccrimes against human\u00adity,\u201d including torture, jailing dissidents and the open-ended military conscription program that the government justifies as preparation against another Ethiopian invasion.With virtually no investment coming into the country, Asmara has become a city frozen in time. Two donkeys meandered down Harnet Avenue, the capital\u2019s main boulevard, stopping to nibble at a patch of grass around a palm tree. As we watched the crowds walk down the tidy avenue lined by an imposing red brick cathedral, a 1930s-era Art Deco movie theater and crumbling Italian bakeries and cappuccino bars, Nega defended his decision to turn to the dictatorship for support.\u201cDo we really have to discuss the kind of dictatorships that the U.S. sleeps with?\u201d he asked me. \u201cHere is a country that was willing to give us sanctuary, a country that had once been part of Ethiopia. I look at any of these people, I talk to them, and they are just like me, they are as Ethiopian as I am. Why should I not get help from them?\u201dNega insisted that he saw some positives in the dictatorship. \u201cThis is the only country that says, despite its poverty, \u2018We are going to chart our own course \u2014 whether you like it or not,\u2019\u2009\u201d he told me. \u201cThey are not corrupt. You see these government officials driving 1980s cars, torn down the middle. I have seen their lives, their houses. There is some element of a David-and-Goliath struggle in this thing.\u201d He called the United Nations report describing crimes against humanity an \u201cexaggeration.\u201d (A Western diplomat in Asmara I talked to, who asked not to be identified because of the political sensitivities of his position, agreed with Nega\u2019s assessment of the report, saying it was based on testimony of refugees in Europe who had \u201can interest in depicting their country as badly as possible to justify their status.\u201d)It goes without saying that Nega was reluctant to speak harshly about the nation that was providing his movement with a refuge \u2014 and that could snatch it away at any moment. \u201cI don\u2019t want to butt into their personal issues,\u201d he said carefully. \u201cThey\u2019ve always been nice to us.\u201d Out of the public eye, however, the rebel leader can be more critical. \u201cHe holds no illusions about Eritrea,\u201d says his friend and former Bucknell colleague Dean Baker.I asked Nega if he was confident that pressure by the rebel groups could bring down the Ethiopian government. Nega believed that momentum was on his side. \u201cThis resistance to the state is coming in every direction now, in all parts of the country,\u201d he said. He was giving himself \u201cfour or five years\u201d before he and his rebel forces entered Ethiopia as part of a new democratic dispensation. \u201cIt certainly won\u2019t be a decade,\u201d he told me.Until that happens, Nega will continue planning and preparing from a precarious and lonely limbo. Back at the bungalow, he led me down the corridor and showed me where he slept: a monastic chamber furnished with a single bed, an armoire and a night table strewn with jars of vitamins and blood-pressure medication. (He lost his medical insurance when he left Bucknell, but still has American insurance coverage through his wife, and he picked up a three-month supply of the medicine on his May trip to the United States.) He retrieved from the freezer a chilled bottle of Absolut and poured two glasses. We sat in the concrete courtyard, beside a clothesline draped with Nega\u2019s laundry. The power failed again, casting us into total darkness, then returned a few seconds later. The contrast with his previous life in the States \u2014 cheering for the Lewisburg Green Dragons, his son\u2019s high-school track team; vacationing on the beaches of Maryland and North Carolina with his extended family \u2014 could hardly have been more extreme.\u201cIf you like comfort, and that\u2019s what drives you, you\u2019ll never do this,\u201d he told me, taking a sip of the ice-cold vodka. \u201cBut sometimes you get really surprised. Once you have a commitment to something, all these things that you thought were normal in your day-to-day life become unnecessary luxuries.\u201dJoshua Hammer is a freelance foreign correspondent and the author of \u201cThe Bad-Ass Librarians of Timbuktu.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Please.As one walks down the sidewalks in residential areas, shaded by mature trees and basking in the city\u2019s sunny, mild weather, it\u2019s not too hard to understand why homeowners are trying to keep Palo Alto small despite its reputation for giving birth to the world\u2019s next big thing.But as symbols go, it\u2019s hard to beat the paradox of bad cellphone reception in the cradle of cutting-edge technology.Brian Reid, a computer scientist and Palo Alto resident, blames \u201can unbelievable, fanatical fear of cell towers\u201d among Palo Alto residents for the somewhat spotty coverage, and he said heavy data usage compounded the problem.Mr. Reid, who lives four doors from the house of Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple who died in 2011, remembers the irony in 2007, a time of even worse cellphone coverage, when the iPhone was being introduced.

Facebook spent months classifying phrases commonly used in clickbait headlines. Mr. Mosseri offered examples like \u201cThe Dog Barked at the Deliveryman and His Reaction Was Priceless,\u201d or \u201cWhen She Looked Under Her Couch Cushions and Saw THIS \u2026 I Was SHOCKED!\u201dThe company\u2019s algorithms then took note of the websites from which the articles were coming, and could detect patterns of traffic coming from those sites over time. That process was then automated, and content identified as clickbait will now appear lower in the news feed than before. Mr. Mosseri likened the practice to a kind of email spam filtering process.The move will most likely heighten the anxiety of publishers that rely heavily on Facebook for traffic and often complain about having little insight into the company\u2019s decision-making on how its all-powerful algorithm functions.The social network\u2019s vast user base and sophisticated targeting capabilities allow publishers to reach new audiences far beyond the direct traffic a media company receives at its own site. As a result, Facebook has been able to largely dictate the terms on which it engages with publishers, which have few other options for distributing their articles.Julie Hansen, the president and chief operating officer of the online publication Business Insider, said it would take Facebook\u2019s latest algorithm change under consideration.\u201cWe don\u2019t do what we consider to be clickbaity headlines,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we\u2019ll certainly consider Facebook\u2019s guidance when we look to post our content onto Facebook and adapt the headlines if needed.\u201dFacebook said that publishers that have clickbaitlike headlines and are ranked lower because of the algorithm change will have the opportunity to change their ways and rise again in the rankings.Some publishers are now betting on a future beyond total reliance on Facebook, as companies like Snapchat and Google offer media companies other avenues to distribute their work.\u201cToday we\u2019re at peak Facebook \u2014 Facebook dominates everything,\u201d said Zachary Kaplan, a vice president at the investment firm General Atlantic, which has invested in digital media companies like BuzzFeed and Vox Media.\u201cWe will naturally evolve to a place where there will be more competition among digital distributors,\u201d he said, \u201cand that would result in, naturally, more leverage for publishers.\u201dFor now, Facebook said it planned to improve relationships with publishers by becoming more transparent about its news feed practices. Mr. Mosseri regularly meets with publishers to discuss algorithm changes.\u201cIt\u2019s becoming clear to us how there\u2019s a lot of anxiety over what we do,\u201d Mr. Mosseri said. \u201cI spend a lot of time trying to ease that anxiety.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We have to be cautious because it\u2019s not only our communications that will be affected. Our electrical grid. Our water supply. In my opinion, the talk of getting rid of cash money is frivolous. When you are out of electricity, you can\u2019t even buy a hamburger at the fast-food chain. You can have $100, but they can\u2019t give you change.

He famously said, \u201cWar sometimes dreams of itself.\u201d I found it a deep observation, and I asked several individuals, and no one had a real answer. Sometimes a deep question is better than a straight answer. I think we should start to develop deep questions of what we are doing here with the internet and what the internet is doing on its own.

{"Headline": "Amazon Has Big Plans for Alexa: Running the \u2018Star Trek\u2019 Home", "Date": "2016-08-07", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Amazon surprised a lot of people when its Echo, a $180 so-called smart speaker, became a hit, giving them a novel way to play music, turn on the lights in their homes and set thermostats with voice commands.Amazon, though, has much bigger plans for the technology behind Echo. It wants the Alexa Voice Service, which powers Echo, to be an ingredient in devices around the home and beyond, even if they aren\u2019t made by Amazon.The vision of an omnipresent intelligent assistant is one Amazon shares, in one form or another, with most other big technology companies, including Apple, Google and Microsoft. Along with a handful of start-ups, these companies see their intelligent assistants as powerful new ways for users to interact with devices and internet services \u2014 just as smartphone touch screens were.Many technology specialists think that people will be O.K. with a single intelligent assistant in their lives but that most won\u2019t have the patience to regularly use two or three of them, each with its individual quirks. As a result, each company is racing to weave its assistant into as many devices and services as possible.\u201cWe\u2019re taking $180 worth of utility and adding it into a $200 device,\u201d he said.Ford Motor is working with Amazon to integrate Alexa into its vehicles so drivers can control smart-home features like lights, thermostats and security systems from their cars.Over 10,000 developers have registered to integrate Alexa into their products, Amazon said. It won\u2019t say how many Echo units it has sold, except to say that millions of devices with Alexa in them have been purchased.In an interview this spring, David Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for devices, said that the company wanted there to be as many Alexa-linked \u201cendpoints\u201d around the home as possible and that Amazon did not really care who made those devices. Amazon has expanded its lineup of devices that use Alexa with its Echo Dot, a miniature version of the Echo speaker, and Amazon Tap, a portable Bluetooth speaker.\u201cThe longer-term vision is a little bit like the \u2018Star Trek\u2019 computer,\u201d Mr. Limp said. \u201cCaptain Kirk or Picard could sit on the bridge and ask anything and get the right answer.\u201dBut while Amazon has made a lot of progress in this regard, it may have a hard time extending Alexa\u2019s reach outside the home because of its weaknesses in mobile technology, analysts say.The success of Echo has been described as a redemption of sorts for Amazon after it suffered a brutal defeat in the smartphone market with its Fire Phone, which the company stopped selling after poor sales \u2014 a misstep that has left Amazon vulnerable.Apple and Google have clear advantages over Amazon because of their dominant positions in the mobile market. And they are pushing their versions of Alexa \u2014 Siri and Google\u2019s assistant \u2014 as ways to control other devices throughout the home.As intelligent assistants improve in quality, Jan Dawson, an analyst at Jackdaw Research, thinks people will want these virtual helpers to follow them all day like a companion. \u201cWhat you want from an assistant is that they are always available to you everywhere,\u201d he said.While Amazon could eventually give people access to Alexa\u2019s functions through apps on smartphones (a couple of apps from independent developers do this already), Mr. Dawson is skeptical that Amazon will be able to make them work as well as assistants more deeply integrated into smartphones by Apple and Google.\u201cThey\u2019re basically absent on smartphones, which are devices we take everywhere we go,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s tenure.\u201cWe believe the E.P.A.\u2019s handling of this matter aggravated the situation, causing undue expense to our agencies,\u201d read the letter, which was signed by Dr. Zucker and Basil Seggos, the state\u2019s environmental commissioner.In particular, Dr. Zucker and Mr. Seggos suggested that the E.P.A. had taken \u201cno less than three different positions regarding PFOA,\u201d causing \u201cgreat public concern, frustration and anxiety.\u201dJudith A. Enck, the agency\u2019s administrator with responsibility for New York, defended the E.P.A.\u2019s performance, noting that it had acted first to warn residents of Hoosick Falls about high levels of PFOA, and advising residents to avoid cooking with or drinking the water. \u201cThere was no confusion between the E.P.A. and the Health Department\u201d about warnings to residents, she said in an interview. \u201cThere was disagreement.\u201dMoreover, Ms. Enck said, the agency\u2019s adjustment of the acceptable level of PFOA in water from 400 parts per trillion to 100 parts to its current long-term level of 70 was not hard to understand. \u201cThe State Health Department are distinguished professionals,\u201d she said. \u201cThey can follow the number of 400 to 70.\u201dState officials have identified the source of the contamination as the Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics plant, a bland structure on the edge of the Hoosic River, not far from the municipal wells that provide Hoosick Falls with its drinking water.Dr. Marcus Martinez, a local physician and another lifelong resident who testified alongside Mr. Hickey, said that he had long noted what he believed to be unusually high rates of cancer in the village. He said that he and Mr. Hickey had brought their concerns, as well as test results, to the attention of village and state officials in 2014, but had been frustrated by a lack of action.\u201cI do believe our citizens were advised incorrectly to consume water that was unsafe for at least for 12 months,\u201d Dr. Martinez said.\u201cSaint-Gobain Performance Plastics remains fully committed to working closely with local, state and federal officials, with a shared focus on ensuring that the people of Hoosick Falls have drinking water that meets or exceeds current advisories set by E.P.A. and New York,\u201d the one-page statement said. \u201cAnd in the investigation of the source and/or sources that is just getting underway.\u201dThat statement \u2014 and the sentiment that the job is unfinished \u2014 seemed evident on Tuesday as Mr. Hickey spoke about what he had hoped to accomplish in trying to discover why his father, who had driven a school bus as a second job, had died.\u201cI think it goes back to kids on the bus,\u201d Mr. Hickey said, pausing to compose himself. \u201cBecause for him, that was his family as well.

{"Headline": "Why It\u2019s Not Enough Just to Be Disruptive", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "Supported byAnother ViewThe unanimous takeaway has been that incumbents everywhere are poised to get their clocks cleaned by a stampede of disruptive insurgents \u2014 unless they buy them first.This analysis, however, misdiagnoses recent transactions as a series of new-versus-old shootouts.To be sure, the web has been grinding down barriers to entry for 20 years, reducing the advantages of incumbents. For new entrants, this flatter playing field creates opportunity. But since the key tools at their disposal are universally available \u2014 including to companies like Facebook and Google, with enormous scale advantages \u2014 this only helps them get into the game, not capture any value lost by legacy firms. Short-term success may be driven by exceptional execution; long-term value creation requires building a defensible model.Any microeconomics textbook will tell you there are limited sources of competitive advantage. The most valuable companies combine several reinforcing strands, like scale and customer loyalty. Gillette has long been, literally, a textbook example.In 1996, Warren E. Buffett, then the largest shareholder in Gillette, commented: \u201cYou go to bed feeling very comfortable just thinking about two and a half billion males with hair growing while you sleep. No one at Gillette has trouble sleeping.\u201dBut 20 years later, management at Gillette (long since acquired by Procter & Gamble) is probably tossing and turning a little more. Gillette\u2019s scale still provides formidable advantages (wide retail distribution, superior patented technology through large R.&D. investment), and its well-known brand (reinforced through mass-media advertising) creates a strong habit in loyal customers acquired early in their lives.However, those advantages are plainly no longer as formidable as they were at the company\u2019s zenith. For an insurgent like Dollar Shave Club, online sales reduce the impact of Gillette\u2019s big lead in drugstore shelf space, and cloud-computing services reduce the required upfront technology investment. Targeted direct marketing on Facebook and other social channels obviates the need for a mass-media campaign, while customer reviews and word-of-mouth can spread the word. At the high end, Gillette\u2019s patented, multi-blade, vibrating razor is a tough opponent, so naturally new entrants focus on the entry level \u2014 where they can rebrand cheap, no-name blades to compete.In Jet\u2019s case, the serial entrepreneur Marc Lore was able to build a large e-commerce company for a few hundred million dollars in just a couple of years by taking an innovative approach to pricing and distribution. And Walmart is plainly convinced that Jet\u2019s expertise and momentum will help it compete with Amazon. Jet\u2019s negative gross margins, which would have required large continuing investments, will disappear when combined with Walmart\u2019s purchasing and distribution scale.While it is hard to stay ahead solely through superior execution over an extended period, it is sometimes enough in the short term to draw a deep-pocketed buyer where there are strong, immediate synergies. Creating enormous value over the long term requires turning a tactical edge into some form of durable advantage.While there are plenty of extraordinary start-ups creating new markets with a path to genuine advantage, self-described \u201cdisrupters\u201d often find that the same forces that allowed them to get going initially also let in a horde of rivals. Competition drains away profit.This is particularly likely where the \u201cdisruptive innovation\u201d does not greatly change the cost structure or end-user experience. Putting a thin layer of software on a people-intensive service business, for instance, may win some immediate sales against Luddite competitors, but it is not necessarily sustainable, nor will it conjure up fat margins. New and existing competitors can often spiff up their supporting tech, too.As the Columbia Business School Professor Bruce C. Greenwald pointed out in his book \u201cCompetition Demystified,\u201d product differentiation on its own is not the basis for sustainable advantage. In his renowned example, \u201calmost everybody makes toasters\u201d \u2014 and if consumers one day demanded \u201ctoasters that sing when the bread is ready\u201d \u2014 soon every manufacturer would offer a \u201ccrooning toaster.\u201dThe rise of web-fueled competition is plainly inexorable. Computers are infinitely patient and accurate in comparing prices and opportunities, and now companies can provide a complete set of services to atomize the fixed costs formerly required for market entry.However, despite the threat to profits, there is no cause for gloom. Superior tactical execution can still create real value, particularly where it provides ammunition for a bigger war (like Walmart\u2019s battle with Amazon). And in the long term, value is created not by disruption, but by weaving together advantages (as both Amazon and Walmart have done in different ways) that together create a barrier that is hard to storm.Jeremy G. Philips is a general partner at Spark Capital and an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Middle-Income Jobs Finally Show Signs of a Rebound", "Date": "2016-08-18", "News": "Supported byThe American economy is finally creating more middle-income jobs, according to a new analysis released Thursday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in a turnabout from the feast-and-famine pattern earlier in the recovery, when hiring was strongest at the bottom and top of the wage scale.The findings suggest that it may soon be time to retire a familiar criticism of the long but lackluster economic rebound that has been underway since the end of the Great Recession in 2009: the hollowing out of the American middle class.Between 2013 and 2015, employers added nearly 2.3 million workers earning from $30,000 to $60,000 a year, primarily in fields like education, construction, transportation and social services. That was roughly 50 percent more than in either the high-wage or low-wage categories during the same period.By contrast, the Fed researchers found, of the nearly 7.6 million jobs created from 2010 to 2013, only about a fifth fell into the middle-tier category, with the largest number instead coming from lower-paid sectors like food preparation and health care support.\u201cThe tide has begun to turn,\u201d said William C. Dudley, president of the New York Fed. \u201cFor the first time in quite a while, we are seeing gains in middle-wage jobs actually outnumber gains in higher- and lower-wage jobs nationwide.\u201dAlthough the economy has created nearly 15 million jobs since employment bottomed out in early 2010, the gains in the recovery have been noticeably uneven. While many cities along the East and West Coasts have been prolific job creators, parts of the Midwest and South have not experienced similar improvements.At the same time, most American workers have made only paltry wage gains until recently, despite steady hiring that has helped bring the national unemployment rate down to 4.9 percent last month from a high of 10 percent in late 2009.\u201cIt\u2019s important, but we are coming off of a really low threshold,\u201d said Diane Swonk, a veteran independent economist based in Chicago, referring to the new Fed study. \u201cWe\u2019ve shifted gears, but we\u2019re only now beginning to regain the quality in terms of jobs.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve got a long way to go,\u201d Ms. Swonk added, noting that after inflation, family incomes were still below where they were in 2000. \u201cIt\u2019s more than a lost decade.\u201dThe nascent national improvement identified by the Fed researchers in New York also held true in the metropolitan region in recent years, with New York City and surrounding suburbs adding 179,000 middle-wage jobs from 2013 to 2015, compared with just 18,000 from 2010 to 2013.The shift coincided with the passing of the baton from finance to technology as the major driver in local job creation.More than any area in the United States, with the possible exception of San Francisco, New York City has come to symbolize an economy built on vast gains for a lucky few, with most everyone else largely standing still.But as the motor of New York\u2019s economy, Wall Street is yielding to Silicon Alley and Brooklyn, as technology companies like Google and smaller start-ups bulk up while banks and hedge funds slim down.Since 2010, tech employment in New York City has jumped by 53,000, while securities industry jobs have increased by just 12,000.In fact, with 172,400 workers in 2015, employment in the New York securities industry remains well short of where it peaked before the financial crisis. There were more than 125,000 tech workers in New York City last year, nearly double the total a decade ago.\u201cIn the past, the city has counted on job growth from Wall Street to fuel economic growth during recoveries and expansions,\u201d Mr. Dudley said. \u201cThis time around, however, job gains in the securities industry have been quite meager.\u201dHiring in fields like internet publishing, online shopping and scientific research and development, Mr. Dudley added, \u201cis picking up much of the slack created by the softness of the securities industry.\u201dThe local tech boom has also spread the largess well beyond the canyons of Wall Street. Private sector job growth in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx was stronger last year than it was in Manhattan.While technology companies are still mostly based in Manhattan, Brooklyn has benefited from what economists call a multiplier effect, as young tech workers move to the borough in search of more affordable housing and patronize restaurants, clubs and other services there.The South Bronx, once synonymous with urban decay, is also on an upswing, especially around the markets in the Hunts Point area, said Jason Bram, a researcher with the New York Fed. Queens has benefited from its proximity to local airports.Suburban counties like Rockland, Westchester and Nassau are also prospering again, and closer-in counties in New Jersey, like Bergen, Essex, Middlesex and Monmouth, are finally showing signs of life.Still, large parts of upstate New York, including Binghamton, Elmira and Syracuse, are struggling economically. Ithaca and Albany have been exceptions upstate, paced by gains in education and emerging fields like nanotechnology.There\u2019s plenty of need for further improvement, Mr. Dudley said, but he suggested that the increase in middle-class jobs since 2013 may mark a turning point in the recovery.\u201cThis is an important development in the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it were to continue, it would create more opportunities for workers and their families who have been struggling up to now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But the quality of these apps varies, so here are some of the best that can give you a glamorous look, rather than make you look like a circus clown.At this point you see a live view of your face wearing the digital makeup, and it is impressive. Like one of Snapchat\u2019s popular weird live filters, but with more finesse, the digital special effects follow your face in real time as you move, and even adjust to the contour of your eyes and mouth as you open or close them.The upshot is that you can see how you look wearing digital eyeliner, lipstick, blush or eye shadow in real time. You can even turn and angle your face or smile just as you would if you were applying real makeup in a mirror.Then the app applies digital makeup, which you choose from a dial-like interface. The options include the ability to choose hairstyles and colors. And if the look of, for example, the artificial eyeliner is not right, you can fine-tune the shape of each effect.Unlike its peers, YouCam includes special features like party makeup looks and the chance to add accessories like earrings. It also lets users enhance features (for example, de-emphasizing your nose or minimizing blemishes).

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Broadway Bounty Hunter\u2019 Stars Annie Golden as Herself", "Date": "2016-08-23", "News": "Supported byThe show, featuring songs by Joe Iconis and a book by Mr. Iconis, Lance Rubin and Jason SweetTooth Williams, turns on a willfully silly conceit. An out-of-work actor \u2014 that\u2019s Annie as Annie \u2014 pursues a second career as a vigilante chasing down dangerous criminals. Powered by a silky retro-R&B score, the musical delights with its loopy idea for longer than you might expect, but as the plot sprouts more absurdities, it ultimately begins to feel like an overextended \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d sketch (albeit a good one).It\u2019s safe to assume that the wackier details do not correspond directly to Ms. Golden\u2019s experience, although the show makes specific references to her career before it spins off into freaky fantasyland. At an audition for a new jukebox musical, Annie (the character) meets a younger actor who notes that Annie has been in \u201cHair\u201d and \u201cAssassins\u201d and \u201cLeader of the Pack\u201d and \u201cThe Full Monty\u201d \u2014 as indeed Ms. Golden has.\u201cNice to know there are fans out there,\u201d Annie responds with a grateful smile.\u201cOh no, I\u2019m not a fan,\u201d comes the deflating reply. \u201cI just Googled you when I heard your name.\u201dIt\u2019s that kind of day for poor Annie, who\u2019s later rejected for a part \u2014 playing the mother! \u2014 by a director she once worked with, and told to come back to read for the role of the \u201ckooky maid.\u201d So it goes for a \u201cWoman of a Certain Age,\u201d as the engaging opening number reminds us. Annie\u2019s spirit begins to circle the drain as she trudges home, only to have the lights go out because she didn\u2019t pay her electric bill.In another appealing ballad, about days gone by, Annie sings, \u201cMy voice could kill in any key, never had to take the harmony.\u201d But those years are past, for the character at least. Metaphorically speaking, the chorus tells us \u201cthey don\u2019t spin those records anymore.\u201dWhat\u2019s an out-of-work actor to do? Beating up bad guys beats going back to waiting tables, right?So Annie embarks upon a rigorous training regimen and finds a professional (and maybe romantic) partner in the icy-cool Lazarus, played with slick magnetism by Alan H. Green. Their first mission is to head for South America to capture a big-time brothel owner and drug pusher, Mac Roundtree (a shout-out to Richard Roundtree, who played Shaft back in the day), portrayed as a wild-eyed predator by Jeff McCarthy.Although the scenes and songs that follow have their pleasures \u2014 Anastacia McCleskey slinks and sings seductively as the tough leader of Mac\u2019s prostitutes \u2014 the quirks of the plot gradually descend from zany to ludicrous. Mac\u2019s true identity, for instance, involves a preposterous coincidence.And the show\u2019s silliness might go down easier, and might even be moving, if the story were framed as the fantasy of an actor with an overactive imagination and no role to channel it into; instead we are essentially expected to take its outlandish events at face value.Mr. Iconis frames the similarities between Annie\u2019s dual careers with knowing precision in a song for Annie and Shiro Jin, as he attempts to persuade her to join his team: \u201cBounty hunting is one part animal instinct,\u201d he sings, \u201cone part primal rage, one part valiant courage and the wisdom that comes with age.\u201dThat\u2019s a useful skill set to drive an actor through the merciless grind of role-snaring, not to mention facing audiences eight times a week. Even if the job you are lucky enough to get is playing yourself.An earlier version of the cast box with this review misstated the closing date of \u201cBroadway Bounty Hunter.\u201d It is Sept. 4, not 24.Broadway Bounty HunterMusic and lyrics by Joe Iconis; book by Mr. Iconis, Lance Rubin and Jason SweetTooth Williams; directed by Julianne Boyd; choreography by Jeffrey Page; musical direction/vocal arrangements by Joel Waggoner; sets by Timothy Mackabee; costumes by Bobby Frederick Tilley; lighting by Eric Southern; sound by Josh Millican; production stage manager, E Sara Barnes; music supervisor/orchestrations by Charlie Rosen; fight choreography by Ryan Winkles; produced by Branden Huldeen; artistic producer, William Finn.

But there is a flip side to that: Chinese internet companies have had a hard time breaking out of it.Two decades ago, China essentially walled off its internet from the rest of the world. The result helped create an environment where local companies (not to mention censorship) thrived. Today, companies like Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba are among the biggest internet companies in the world.Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba all have offices in the United States, but their most successful efforts so far have been investments and acquisitions.One notable outlier from this trend has been the music start-up Music.ly.

Even with an architecture degree from the University of California, Berkeley, he found himself laid off and out of luck. Rather than look for another job in the fields of housing or public policy, where he had planned a career, he decided to take a risk.\u201cActing was always in the back of my head,\u201d Mr. Abdul-Mateen said.So he left the Bay Area for Los Angeles with the notion that if he could somehow get cast in a McDonald\u2019s commercial, he might end up with a bit part in a soap opera, which could lead to a role on a bigger network show. \u201cI made a plan: If I hadn\u2019t done anything in three years, I was going to say, \u2018O.K., back to a job in an architecture firm or public policy,\u2019\u201d he said.In Los Angeles, he auditioned for an educational theater group, only to be told he was too old. But the instructor\u2019s husband was casting a small production of \u201cTwelfth Night,\u201d and soon Mr. Abdul-Mateen found himself playing Antonio.\u201cSomeone in the cast was applying to graduate drama school, and I said, \u2018You can do that?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI Googled the top programs in the country. I prepped for about seven months, doing auditions in my living room, talking to the wall.\u201dTo prepare for his role, Mr. Abdul-Mateen worked on his moves four to seven hours a day. \u201cBefore this, I was not a dancer,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew when the music comes on, you move to it. I\u2019m from New Orleans, so I like second line. But I thought I was more coordinated than I turned out to be.\u201dAfter spending his early childhood in the Magnolia housing projects, he moved to Oakland. \u201cBut New Orleans is one of those places that doesn\u2019t leave the house,\u201d he said.A sense of authenticity will be crucial to the show\u2019s success. Those familiar with its setting are likely to watch closely, given that its Australian creator\u2019s background is so different from those of the characters on screen. Mr. Luhrmann brought aboard Grandmaster Flash and Kurtis Blow to school the cast members and keep the look and atmosphere correct.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t claim to be an expert,\u201d Mr. Abdul-Mateen said of Mr. Luhrmann.The actor has come to appreciate his character\u2019s vintage style. \u201cYou notice how much self-expression is really embedded in the fashion,\u201d he said. \u201cMen wearing their shirts down with their chests open.

{"Headline": "Uber Aims for an Edge in the Race for a Self-Driving Future", "Date": "2016-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA world in which cars drive themselves may come sooner than once thought.On Thursday, Uber said that it would begin testing self-driving cars in Pittsburgh in a matter of weeks, allowing people in the city to hail modified versions of Volvo sport utility vehicles to get around the city.Uber also said it had acquired Otto, a 90-person start-up including former Google and Carnegie Mellon engineers that is focused on developing self-driving truck technology to upend the shipping industry.Those moves are the most recent indications of Uber\u2019s ambitions for autonomous vehicles that can provide services to both consumers and businesses.Suddenly, it seems, both Silicon Valley and Detroit are doubling down on their bets for autonomous vehicles. And in what could emerge as a self-driving-car arms race, the players are investing in, or partnering with, or buying outright the specialty companies most focused on the requisite hardware, software and artificial intelligence capabilities.Despite their multitude of sensors and processors, autonomous cars have a lot of trouble with some everyday aspects of driving.\u201cIt appears 2016 will go down in history as the year of the autonomous vehicle partnership,\u201d said Karl Brauer, an analyst with the auto research firm Kelley Blue Book.But the Ford and Uber initiatives are not without risk. Federal auto safety regulators are preparing guidelines for autonomous vehicles that may or may not include the need for a steering wheel or require the presence of a driver who can step in should computerized systems falter.In a nod to the highly experimental nature of its Pittsburgh plan, Uber intends to have an actual human being behind the wheel \u2014 just in case. But while Ford is looking five years out, Uber is moving aggressively toward driverless fleets, despite the regulatory uncertainties.\u201cThere\u2019s an urgency to our mission about being part of the future,\u201d Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s chief executive, said on Thursday in an interview. \u201cThis is not a side project. This is existential for us.\u201dThat explains Uber\u2019s other announcement on Thursday \u2014 its deal to buy Otto for undisclosed terms, to beef up its own in-house expertise in self-driving technology.The acquisition of Otto follows Uber\u2019s recent opening of an advanced technology center in Pittsburgh, in conjunction with Carnegie Mellon University. The company has also hired engineers directly away from Google, which has been immersed in developing autonomous cars for a decade.Like Uber, Google is intent on developing self-driving cars for urban taxi use \u2014 reasoning that the slow speeds and relatively predictable environment of city streets that can be thoroughly, digitally mapped is the best and safest near-term purpose of autonomous vehicles. But for Uber, such cars are not a side bet but a way to be more fully in control of its business by eliminating the need for drivers who expect to be paid.\u201cUber arguably has more at stake in creating self-driving cars than any other automotive entity,\u201d Mr. Brauer said.Although the market for big sales of fully self-driving cars is still years away, the investment and research activities are on a fast track.Uber plans to open a 180,000-square-foot facility in Palo Alto, Calif., to house Otto, which will operate as a stand-alone company focused specifically on upending the long-distance trucking industry. Otto engineers will also work out of offices in San Francisco and Pittsburgh.But that talent and technology will apply more broadly to the technology behind Uber\u2019s grander self-driving car efforts, Mr. Kalanick said. He said he believed that his company\u2019s approach \u2014 a combination of teaming up with hardware manufacturers, Otto\u2019s software expertise and a large network of more than 50 million monthly riders as recently as July \u2014 places Uber in the best position to be competitive with companies like Google.\u201cThe first company in the space is not always the winner,\u201d Anthony Levandowski, chief executive of Otto, said on Thursday. \u201cIntel was not the first chip maker. Facebook wasn\u2019t the first social network.\u201dThe self-driving revolution has already hit a few speed bumps, in vehicles that are not fully autonomous but employ some elements of the technology. The electric-car maker Tesla is under investigation by federal regulators looking into a fatal crash in May of a Tesla Model S sedan whose driver had the vehicle\u2019s Autopilot assisted-driving system engaged.After Joshua Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio, was killed driving a Tesla Model S in the first fatality involving a self-driving car, questions have arisen about the safety of the car\u2019s technology.The German automaker Daimler was forced recently to pull an advertisement in the United States that possibly overstated the safety of assisted-driving options in a new Mercedes-Benz model.And Google is continuously explaining how minor accidents are occurring in self-driving vehicles it has been testing for some time in California.But potential safety concerns have hardly slowed the pace of research and investment by G.M., Ford and others. In Uber\u2019s case, Mr. Kalanick said he was confident that government officials would approve self-driving vehicles once the industry proves their effectiveness in real-world conditions.\u201cRegulators are going to optimistically make it work, while making it safer for the whole community,\u201d he said.In the Pittsburgh pilot program, Uber plans not only to have human drivers aboard as a safety precaution. Passengers who use the vehicles will have to \u201copt in\u201d and agree to be participants in the road test before riding, according to Uber.G.M. and Lyft are also planning their own testing program for autonomous ride-hailing vehicles, although they have not disclosed details.That plan, along with this week\u2019s announcements by Uber and Ford make clear that the initial market for robotic cars will likely be for commercial fleets rather than vehicles consumers would park in their own garages.Industry analysts see ride-hailing firms and delivery businesses as natural customers for the first autonomous vehicles, in part because the cars and trucks are expected to carry high price tags.Ford officials said this week that ride-hailing services are able to generate the passenger revenues needed to cover the high cost of the cars.Raj Nair, Ford\u2019s global product development chief, said that eliminating human drivers would drastically lower the cost of a ride-hailing fare. By catering to those companies, Ford expects to build a small, but profitable business segment.Ford has not said how many self-driving vehicles it expects to produce on an annual basis, or whether it would adapt one of its current models or build an entirely new vehicle.But the company\u2019s chief executive, Mark Fields, pledged that the vehicles would \u201cbring mobility to millions of people\u201d who do not own cars themselves. And doing so will create a \u201cvery good business\u201d for Ford.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazilians Speak Portuguese, but the Olympics Must Use French", "Date": "2016-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Micha\u00eblle Jean, secretary general of the International Organization of la Francophonie, spent a recent morning at the sultry Lagoa Olympic venue, where the world\u2019s most exciting rowing was taking place. She was not so interested in what was happening on the water.\u201cYou will notice that the commentators are not speaking French,\u201d she said, indignantly. \u201cIn the venue, none of the signs are in French.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a struggle each time you have the Olympic Games, in a different country and a different city,\u201d Ms. Jean said. \u201cWe must be there to make sure the French signs and documents and information are there. We have 3,000 athletes and a lot of people in the public from Francophone countries.\u201dThe reports tend to reflect a mixture of hopefulness and dismay.\u201cIn Beijing, all Olympic signage appeared first in French, then English and Chinese,\u201d the Sochi report says, for instance. \u201cIn Sochi, the signage addressing the international audience was trilingual, but that addressing the spectators appeared in Russian and English.\u201dIn addition, it pointed out, \u201cthe arrival of some new sports to the Olympic program (slopestyle and halfpipe) was not accompanied by a terminology sufficient for these disciplines to be discussed with French terms in the media.\u201dThe Olympics are \u201cobviously a very important showcase,\u201d said Mr. Dibango, who is also serving as a cultural ambassador, performing with Brazilian and French-speaking musicians in Rio as a way to promote the international nature of French.\u201cI see the job as being the flag-bearer of the 300 million people around the world who speak French,\u201d Mr. Dibango said.The average member of the public may have little idea that any of this is going on, but the Francophonie organization takes the issue so seriously that no sooner does one Olympics end than it starts negotiating the terms of the next one. Early discussions about French at the Rio Games were positive, Ms. Jean said, because the Brazilian government was sympathetic and because Carlos Nuzman, the president of the Brazilian organizing committee, speaks fluent French.But then the economy collapsed and the friendly government fell. When the new government came in, it had a lot on its mind, and that did not include the use of French at the Olympics. As the day of the opening ceremony approached, the Francophonie organization had no idea how the evening \u2014 traditionally a fine time for the world to hear and appreciate a lot of beautifully enunciated French spoken by important international officials \u2014 would go.It turned out to be a runaway success. All the main announcements and speeches were delivered in French, along with English and Portuguese. Even better, Ms. Jean said, \u201ceverything was announced first in French \u2014 did you notice?\u201dThe opening ceremony is one thing; the rest of the Olympics is another. Ms. Jean visited the athletes\u2019 village, only to discover that there were French-language signs in the cafeteria but nowhere else. She attributed it to Rio\u2019s budget woes \u2014 translation is expensive \u2014 and the frantic nature of pre-Games preparations. While she understood, she said, \u201cWe were very disappointed at the situation.\u201dVisitors to the Games, too, will see that the thousands of signs at the various event venues are printed only in English and Portuguese, not in French. (Not that the English signs are anything to get excited about, seeming at times to owe more to Google Translate than to a sentient being. \u201cPress the wheelchair button if you have locomotion issues,\u201d a sign next to an elevator at the media center reads. )At the rowing venue on Saturday, the events moved along so quickly that sometimes it was all the announcers could do to pack in the commentary in both Portuguese and English, never mind any other languages. In the stands, several (non-French-speaking) spectators said that, to be honest, language was not at the forefront of their minds.\u201cI hadn\u2019t really thought about it,\u201d said Amy Burba, 44, of Virginia. \u201cBut I heard the people behind us speaking French.\u201dScott MacRae, a Scottish chef who was holding a beer and wearing his Union Jack on his head as a form of sun protection, said that except at the opening and closing ceremonies, French should be kept out of the Olympics.\u201cI like the French passion,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to use French at the Olympics when you have them in a country that is not France.\u201dSeveral older-generation rowing officials at the site bemoaned the loss of French not just at the Olympics but also in sports (and in the world) in general. Americans in particular, they said, do not speak other languages and do not really want to.As Mr. Rolland talked nostalgically about the days when rowing meetings were held in French and English speakers had to listen to the translation on headphones, the Rolling Stones song \u201c(I Can\u2019t Get No) Satisfaction\u201d began playing over the loudspeakers.\u201cIt\u2019s a daily fight,\u201d he said. \u201cA daily fight.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the Olympics for which Micha\u00eblle Jean was le Grand T\u00e9moin. It was the 2012 London Games, not the 2014 Sochi Games.Victor Mather and Sam Dolnick contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

So one by one, he has shed all of them.\u201cI have ambition,\u201d he said, \u201cto have no ambition.\u201d\u201cIn the past 25 years, income has gone down for the 18-to-35-year-olds, student loan debt is at an all-time high,\u201d Mr. Altucher said over a lunch of zucchini pancakes at a Russian restaurant in the Flatiron district. \u201cWe had $3 trillion in bailout money, and income inequality got higher than ever. People feel like they were scammed.\u201dMr. Altucher\u2019s diagnosis will come as no surprise to the anxious middle class, the downsized and the dispossessed who have propelled the angry populism of Bernie Sanders and Donald J. Trump.But while there is no shortage of anger and confusion about the supposed waning of the American Dream, what makes Mr. Altucher stand out are his Cassandra-like conclusions.Similarly, he believes homeownership is a rip-off foisted upon unwitting citizens by a $14 trillion mortgage industry.And he think stocks are a racket. It\u2019s a fierce worldview that is rooted in Mr. Altucher\u2019s own roller-coaster life.In the 1990s, as a young Silicon Alley start-up whiz, Mr. Altucher made millions with a web-design company, Reset Inc., that counted Sony and Miramax as clients.Soon, he and his wife at the time, Anne (they divorced in 2010), were living in a 5,000-square-foot loft in TriBeCa that he bought for $1.8 million and spent another $1 million renovating. He felt flush enough to take a helicopter to Atlantic City on weekends to play poker.The lavish lifestyle did not fill his emotional void. \u201cNobody should feel sorry for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI was really stupid, but I thought I was dirt poor. I felt like I needed $100 million to be happy. So I just started investing in all these other companies, and they were just stupid companies. Zero of these investments worked out.\u201dAs his fortunes collapsed, he was forced to sell his apartment for a $1 million loss (it was after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001).\u201cFinancial people were like watching a train wreck in real time,\u201d Mr. Altucher said. \u201cI had friends I hadn\u2019t talked to since high school call me and say, \u2018Hey, are you O.K.?\u2019\u201dHe soon discovered a sizable audience of people whose own dreams had just gone down the sinkhole. They, too, were looking to claw their way out.\u201cThe No. 1 search phrase on Google that takes people to my blog is \u2018I want to die,\u2019\u201d Mr. Altucher said.But Mr. Altucher seems like an unlikely person to look to for solace. Bookish, contrarian and given to speaking in staccato bursts, this skinny computer geek from North Brunswick, N.J., is like the anti-Anthony Robbins, the strapping self-help star.His regular-guy appearance turned out to be a plus, as he developed a following blogging about his win-some-lose-some \u201clife hacker\u201d experiments.It helped that Mr. Altucher, despite his biting views on topics like college, maintained a positive tone. \u201cI am an optimist,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a great novel from the \u201860s by Richard Fari\u00f1a called \u2018Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me.\u2019 Basically, I\u2019ve been down on the floor so many times, I know now that I can always bounce back, and it gets faster each time.\u201dHis philosophy is perhaps most clearly articulated in \u201cChoose Yourself,\u201d which he summarized over lunch like this: \u201cIf you don\u2019t choose the life you want to live, chances are, someone else is going to choose it for you. And the results are probably not going to be pretty.\u201dChapters include \u201cHow to Be Less Stupid\u201d (\u201cI lose at least 20 percent of my intelligence when I am resentful\u201d) and \u201cThe Seven Habits of Highly Effective Mediocre People\u201d (procrastination, he writes, \u201cis your body telling you that you need to back off a bit and think more about what you are doing\u201d).He calls them the four pillars of happiness. \u201cA chair needs four legs to be stable,\u201d he said.And there has never been a better time to choose yourself, he said.He would know. \u201cChoose Yourself,\u201d which Mr. Altucher self-published on Amazon, sold more than a half-million copies, he said, and made The Wall Street Journal\u2019s best-seller list.Mr. Altucher, in fact, disputes that he is a guru in the first place. \u201cI am not a self-help guy at all,\u201d he said.\u201cAdvice is autobiography,\u201d he added. \u201cI only say what has worked for me, and then others can choose to try it or not.\u201dBesides, what worked yesterday may not work tomorrow.\u201cIt\u2019s like Mike Tyson says,\u201d Mr. Altucher said. \u201c\u2018Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.\u2019\u201dAn article on Aug. 7 about the self-help guru James Altucher misstated the name of a website where people may learn basic web development. It is Codecademy.com, not Codeacademy.com.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oracle, Having Bet Billions on Its Future, Sets Sights on Data Analysis", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsOracle Corporation may well be the single most important technology firm for businesses. Over 300,000 companies around the world use its database, and 100,000 customers have purchased its business applications. Even companies gunning for Oracle \u2014 like Amazon, Google and Salesforce \u2014 have used Oracle\u2019s technology.Besides selling applications more efficiently, he said, Oracle has pooled a large amount of information derived from over 1,500 data providers. \u201cMarketers and brands find this very powerful,\u201d he said in an email, as Oracle targets \u201cover 45,000 different dimensions (demographic, geography, online and offline behavior).\u201dIn other words, what Google and Facebook know based on your online life, as well as what companies learn from your shopping habits, credit and warranty behavior, among other things. Oracle will also have data on what customers do after an ad campaign, so advertisers can check the outcome of a Google ad blitz.The same data-heavy approach can be used in functions of business like procurement, human capital management, sales and service, Mr. Kurian thinks. \u201cWe know how payrolls change around job titles, the rate of salary changes in Silicon Valley versus Bangalore, or how many people in a company are buying a $10 printer cartridge,\u201d he told me in an earlier interview.This data analysis could become a valuable adjunct to many of Oracle\u2019s database and applications businesses. Equally, it drives home how the competition in cloud computing is moving from cost savings \u2014 Amazon Web Services started by selling cheap computing and storage \u2014 to value creation through better insight.In that business, large amounts of data are a critical asset \u2014 what Mr. Kurian termed \u201ctrying to be at the center of data gravity.\u201d Oracle definitely has a place there, perhaps a better one than any company.Other elements of success will most likely include reliability, ease of use and price. Oracle may be challenged there, precisely because it has built a big and complicated system of databases, bigger than anything Amazon, Microsoft or Google sells. It has to keep those older customers happy, even as it makes data easier to move around, in and out of the cloud, for different kinds of analysis.In that, Oracle has a powerful and little-noted asset: Despite its reputation as a hard-edge company, it has good engineers with decades of experience. Employees fly in and out of Google or Facebook, but they seem to stay longer, on average, at Oracle.That can be an advantage when it comes to working on complex projects. \u201cUnderstanding complex software takes a year,\u201d Mr. Kurian said. \u201cUnderstanding the intentions behind it, which you need if you\u2019re going to adapt it, takes even longer.\u201dSlow, steady and reliable may make people at the fast, young tech companies snicker.

{"Headline": "G.E., the 124-Year-Old Software Start-Up", "Date": "2016-08-27", "News": "Supported byIt may not qualify as a lightning-bolt eureka moment, but Jeffrey R. Immelt, chief executive of General Electric, recalls the June day in 2009 that got him thinking. He was speaking with G.E. scientists about new jet engines they were building, laden with sensors to generate a trove of data from every flight \u2014 but to what end?That data could someday be as valuable as the machinery itself, if not more so. But G.E. couldn\u2019t make use of it.But in 2011, G.E. also quietly opened a software center in San Ramon, Calif., 24 miles east of San Francisco, across the bay.Today one of San Ramon\u2019s most important projects is to build a computer operating system, but on an industrial scale \u2014 a Microsoft Windows or Google Android for factories and industrial equipment. The project is central to G.E.\u2019s drive to become what Mr. Immelt says will be a \u201ctop 10 software company\u201d by 2020.Silicon Valley veterans are skeptical.Many industries see digital threats, of course. Yet the scope of the challenge is magnified at G.E., a 124-year-old company and the nation\u2019s largest manufacturer, with more than 300,000 employees worldwide. Employees companywide have been making pilgrimages to San Ramon for technology briefings, but also to soak in the culture. Their marching orders are to try to adapt the digital wizardry and hurry-up habits of Silicon Valley to G.E.\u2019s world of industrial manufacturing.6 PhotosG.E.\u2019s success or failure over the next decade, Mr. Immelt says, depends on this transformation. He calls it \u201cprobably the most important thing I\u2019ve worked on in my career.\u201dApparently, there is no Plan B. \u201cIt\u2019s this or bust,\u201d he said.The march of digital technology \u2014 mainly inexpensive sensors, powerful computing and clever software \u2014 into the industrial world has been underway for years under the guise of \u201cthe internet of things\u201d or \u201cthe industrial internet.\u201d It is the next battlefield as companies fight to develop the dominant software layer that connects the machines.It promises to be a huge market for new products, improved service and efficiency gains in industries like energy, transportation and health care. By 2020, the industrial internet market will reach $225 billion, G.E. executives predicted in a recent meeting with analysts.So far, a major application has been predictive maintenance. Software analyzes the data generated by a machine to identify early warning signals that it needs repair, before it breaks down.The data volumes are exploding as machines new and old spawn sensors. By 2020, G.E. estimates that the data flowing off its machines in use will jump a hundredfold. That should enable far more detailed analysis, giving G.E. a chance to sell its customers not machines but \u201cbusiness outcomes,\u201d like fuel savings. Mr. Immelt sees this as a move up the industrial food chain.Yet all of this exposes G.E. to new competition beyond its traditional rivals like Rockwell Automation, Siemens and United Technologies. Tech giants, including Amazon, Cisco, Google, IBM and Microsoft also have their eye on the industrial internet market, as do a bevy of start-ups.There is precedent for trouble in other industries, of course. Google and Facebook transformed media and advertising, Amazon redefined retailing, and Uber applied an entirely new business model to taxis, which hadn\u2019t changed much in generations.\u201cThe real danger is that the data and analysis becomes worth more than the installed equipment itself,\u201d said Karim R. Lakhani, a professor at the Harvard Business School. \u201cG.E. has no choice but to try to do that itself.\u201dUntil this year, Darren Haas hadn\u2019t thought about G.E., certainly not working there. To him, G.E. meant little more than than kitchen appliances and light bulbs. \u201cI had no idea,\u201d Mr. Haas said.But he was intrigued after he met with Harel Kodesh, an expert in mobile and cloud computing who led teams at Microsoft and VMware, a maker of data-center software. Less than two years ago, Mr. Kodesh joined G.E., and he is now chief technology officer of GE Digital.That someone of Mr. Kodesh\u2019s caliber was a G.E. convert got Mr. Haas\u2019s attention. Then, Mr. Haas started grasping the role that G.E. equipment plays across the economy \u2014 in transportation, in hospitals \u2014 \u201ca whole world,\u201d he said. \u201cI found that really, really compelling.\u201dThe other thing Mr. Haas, 41, found appealing was the big computing challenge that lies ahead for the company. In May, he joined G.E. from Apple, where he was a member of the founding team at Siri, the voice-based digital assistant start-up Apple acquired in 2010. When he left Apple, Mr. Haas was head of cloud engineering, managing the computing engine behind Siri, iTunes and iCloud.At GE Digital, Mr. Haas has a similar title, head of platform cloud engineering, but in a different setting. He describes his job as applying modern software technology \u2014 machine learning, artificial intelligence and cloud computing \u2014 to the industrial arena. \u201cI\u2019ve got my work cut out for me,\u201d he said.Mr. Haas is working on the centerpiece of G.E.\u2019s software strategy, a product called Predix. Its evolution mirrors G.E.\u2019s software ambitions.Predix began as little more than a brand of software used by G.E. to service the gear it sells. One showcase use was in jet engines to do predictive maintenance, saving downtime. Around 2013, William Ruh, a former Cisco Systems executive brought in to put together the San Ramon software center, started expanding Predix to other G.E. industrial businesses.But that soon felt too small. The issue was \u201coutside disrupters,\u201d Mr. Ruh said, citing the online lodging start-up Airbnb as an example of rivals that can appear seemingly out of nowhere and that \u201cbring greater productivity \u2014 but don\u2019t own the assets they sell.\u201d G.E., Mr. Ruh notes, is the ultimate big-asset company.The other threat was rising interest among tech companies to take their internet connectivity expertise and try to apply it to industrial businesses. To get ahead of all this, G.E. reimagined Predix as a cloud-based operating system for industrial applications.Mr. Kodesh leads that effort. He ticks off the looming competitors: Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and others. \u201cThose companies are going to encroach on the territory,\u201d Mr. Kodesh said. \u201cAre we going to capitulate, or build something like Predix?\u201dThe basic idea is that G.E. and outside software developers will write programs to run on Predix. This software might, for instance, monitor the health and fine-tune the operation of equipment like oil-field rigs and wind-farm turbines, improving performance, reducing wear and adapting to changing environmental conditions. It amounts to software delivering the equivalent of personalized medicine for machines.Like any other computer operating system, Predix aims to take the complexity out of writing programs, so more people can create them. And while the instincts of the industrial world are proprietary, G.E. is following an open-source model with Predix, providing a basic design, but one open to outside contributors \u2014 more like Android from Google than Windows from Microsoft.Predix, Mr. Kodesh said, will be improved using the software equivalent of Lego blocks. \u201cSome will be G.E.\u2019s, and some will be made by third-party developers,\u201d he said.G.E. is betting that its deep knowledge of industry will give it an edge in this software arms race. The stakes for this kind of programming can be high.For a regular consumer using the internet, a misfiring algorithm in the software \u2014 \u201ca false positive\u201d \u2014 might mean a person sees an irrelevant online ad, or a bad Amazon book suggestion or Netflix movie recommendation, Mr. Kodesh said. Useless, perhaps, but not necessarily costly. But a false positive that prompts an airline to take a jet engine off the wing, Mr. Kodesh said, is a $100,000 mistake.\u201cWe really do need to have different technology, different algorithms and a different cloud, than in the consumer internet,\u201d he said.G.E. has set an ambitious target for Predix. It hopes to attract $100 million in orders this year, on its way to $4 billion in revenue by 2020. By then, the company forecasts that its total digital business \u2014 more than 90 percent of it software \u2014 may reach as much as $15 billion, up from $6 billion now.For Predix to reach its potential, though, G.E. needs outside programmers to write software for it. The company, with its deep pockets, can start the software-writing parade, but will others follow?This will be a major test. And G.E.\u2019s campaign to build an industrial operating system and create a flourishing ecosystem of software for it is just getting underway in earnest.In late July, G.E. hosted a Predix conference in Las Vegas, which attracted 1,200 software developers. Such developer gatherings are part of the playbook of every major software company but unusual for an industrial corporation.G.E. has some built-in advantages. Its installed base is huge. For example, the company says more than a third of the world\u2019s electricity is generated on G.E. equipment. It can make progress simply by winning over the aircraft makers, oil companies, hospitals and utilities that now depend on G.E. machinery.G.E. is starting to attract a developer following. Tata Consultancy Services, for one, says it now has 500 programmers designing and developing Predix applications for customers in the electric-utility, aviation and health care industries. G.E. also promotes partnerships with Infosys, Wipro and Capgemini to help business write Predix software.When he joined in 2011, Mr. Ruh had no illusions that making software a strength at a heavy-industry company would be easy. At the time, he told Mr. Immelt that would be \u201ca 10-year journey,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of that journey.\u201dPart of that is an effort to change an engineering culture that stretches back generations. \u201cIf G.E. is truly going to be a digital-industrial company, we can\u2019t be separate here,\u201d Mr. Ruh said of his software division. Digital \u201ctools and habits\u201d need to be embedded \u201cin how people do their jobs,\u201d he said.In its factory in Greenville, S.C., G.E. produces both giant power generators and evidence that this metamorphosis might work.The three-story building is crowded with immense cranes and milling, grinding and welding machines, overseen by manufacturing engineers and technicians. The finishing touches are being put on one of G.E.\u2019s new gas turbines.It looks like the business end of a rocket ship lying on its side, a gleaming steel dynamo at rest. It weighs 950,000 pounds. It fires up at nearly 2,900 degrees Fahrenheit, and it can generate enough electricity to supply more than 500,000 households.The gas turbine was brought to market in half the typical five years. That kind of accelerated product development is a performance that G.E. hopes to replicate across its industrial businesses. And it is a story of changes in design and manufacturing practices made possible by digital technology.John Lammas, the 56-year-old vice president for power generation engineering, started his working career 40 years ago, on the shop floor of a Rolls-Royce jet engine factory in Birmingham, England. He has been with G.E. for 31 years, moving up the ranks of the company\u2019s jet engine and power turbine divisions.\u201cI\u2019m an old mechanical guy,\u201d he said. But a couple of years ago, he issued an edict: no more paper drawings.In the past, a model of a new part would be made and then converted to detailed blueprints running to 70 pages or more. These would then be physically sent to G.E. manufacturing engineers and outside suppliers to begin setting up the tooling, casting and cutting for the part.This prototype-and-blueprint routine took up to eight weeks. Now, engineers use 3-D computer models, skip the prototype step and instantly send the models electronically.This goes a step beyond computer-aided design, which is commonplace. In Greenville, the designers are for the first time linked directly with manufacturers and suppliers in real time, in what G.E. calls a \u201cdigital thread.\u201d This means they can collaborate in ways that have changed the work process while making it more likely that problems or defects are spotted sooner.Traditionally, one set of engineers designed a part, and only then passed it on to manufacturing. If a problem arose on the supplier side, the design was kicked back and the process started over. \u201cJobs are combining in this digital world,\u201d Mr. Lammas said.Greenville\u2019s own equipment has been a Predix guinea pig. The machinery and factory were retrofitted with data-generating sensors and the software. Matt Krause, the plant manager, said that last winter, when a snowstorm shut the factory for a day, the sensor network detected that the plant had consumed 1,000 pounds of argon, an inert gas used in coatings for parts. The leak was fixed, saving $350,000 a year.\u201cWe can see things we never did before,\u201d Mr. Krause said. Over all, 60 of 200 steps in design and production have been automated or eliminated, reducing work time by 530,000 hours over three years, G.E. estimates.Not all the start-up ideas that G.E. is trying to breed translate comfortably to heavy industry. Lean proponents urge companies to come up with \u201cminimum viable products,\u201d particularly test versions of software programs. But no one wants a minimum viable jet engine or power generator.Yet in Greenville, engineers in the design stages are encouraged to move faster in smaller steps, conduct more experiments, and be willing to fail and try again. It amounts to a sea change in the engineering culture of heavy industry.\u201cAs an engineer, not getting it right the first time, I find painful,\u201d said Bill Byrne, an engineering manager. \u201cIt\u2019s uncomfortable. But it\u2019s been incredibly liberating.\u201dThe old ways, said Mr. Lammas, the engineering chief, had merit. Each step and rule was logical on its own. But the emphasis on flawless execution and perfection fostered a fear of failure. \u201cOvercoming that culture was probably the biggest challenge,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Cuban-American Generation Gap", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast Christmas, Michael and Gisel Davila, a Cuban-American couple who live in Queens, N.Y., were talking to her mother, Maria C. Castillo, while visiting her in Miami. It was a casual conversation, full of small talk about the holidays and work and the weather, until Ms. Davila, 30, mentioned that she and her husband were thinking about booking a trip over a long weekend to Cuba.\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d her mother said immediately. \u201cYou can\u2019t go.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t good,\u201d said Mr. Davila, 33. \u201cI seriously believe if I went to Cuba with my wife, my mother-in-law would never forgive us.\u201dFor most Cuban-Americans born here, the island of Cuba has existed as only a mythological ideal: a place whose culture, language and food could be recreated in exile but whose physical land could only be experienced through stories passed down from immigrant parents and grandparents.But now, thanks to the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba, the island is within easy reach and has emerged as a trendy destination, with companies like Google and Chanel holding high-profile events on the streets of Havana.While immigrant families have been legally allowed to visit Cuba since 2009, they are now thinking much harder about it since the subject is constantly in the news and their non-Cuban friends and colleagues are increasingly going.But within immigrant families, the question of whether to visit Cuba is not a simple one, and in some cases, it is creating dissension between members of different generations.Parents and grandparents who lived through the Communist revolution led by Fidel Castro are gripped by angst in considering their loved ones stepping foot on Cuban soil still ruled by Mr. Castro and his brother Ra\u00fal. Members of younger generations who were born in America long to see for themselves a country that has loomed so large in the back stories that shape their identities.\u201cImagine growing up hearing about it, and never being able to get there,\u201d Ms. Davila said. \u201cIt\u2019s like this fruit that is dangled in front of your face, but you can\u2019t actually touch it.\u201dShe and her husband are eager to go, and it irks Mr. Davila that so many travelers without an ethnic connection to Cuba have experienced his family\u2019s country before he has.But they also take seriously Ms. Castillo\u2019s opposition. Like many who escaped the rule of Fidel Castro in the 1960s and 1970s by leaving all their possessions behind, she recoils at the idea of her loved ones lending legitimacy and financial support to a country still under Mr. Castro\u2019s administration.\u201cI don\u2019t see why she has to go,\u201d Ms. Castillo said of her daughter. \u201cNothing has changed. The money doesn\u2019t go to the people. It all goes back to the regime.\u201d She feels so much anger toward Mr. Castro, she said, that she refuses to utter his name.On Mr. Davila\u2019s side, his aunts, uncles and cousins are opposed to relatives visiting the island. At a recent family dinner of roasted pig, fried plantains, rice and beans, some people were referring to Mr. Davila\u2019s brother George, a 37-year-old litigation lawyer in Miami, as \u201ca Communist\u201d for having visited Cuba three times. \u201cThere was like food being thrown,\u201d Mr. Davila said.\u201cWhen they first found out I was going, my father\u2019s sisters were like: \u2018Why are you going? You are going to get yourself arrested. You are going to contribute dollars to the government. You are going to get Communist-brainwashed,\u2019\u201d George said.George and Michael\u2019s mother, Maria Davila, was shamed by friends and relatives for allowing George\u2019s travel. \u201cThey told me and my husband that we were crazy Communists,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018No, we want them to experience what we had there and see another side of the world.\u2019\u201dMaria\u2019s encouragement of her sons\u2019 travels puts her in a minority of permissive parents. But not all adult children are heeding their parents\u2019 admonitions.Miranda Hernandez, a 20-year-old college student at the University of California, Berkeley, said that she was always nervous about how her family would react if she even considered a visit to Cuba. \u201cWhen they did speak about Cuba, they made it sound like North Korea with nice beaches,\u201d she said. \u201cI was raised being told I had no business there.\u201dMs. Hernandez went on CubaOne\u2019s inaugural trip this June. She saw the apartment in the Luyan\u00f3 neighborhood of Havana where her mother grew up and the hospital where she was born.She also met her great-uncle, second cousin and twin 16-year-old third cousins who, she was surprised to know, listen to the same music as American teenagers (Kanye West, Chance the Rapper and Chris Brown).Ms. Hernandez shared with her Cuban family stories and photographs of her Cuban-American family. \u201cWhen I met them, it was as if I knew them my entire life,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was surreal.\u201dWhen Ms. Hernandez first told her parents she would be going on the trip, the conversation turned to yelling. \u201cWhy would you want to go there?\u201d she said her parents said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to show you the nice tourist parts.\u201dAfter the trip, they were calmer and looked at the videos and photographs she took. \u201cThey were glad that some things have changed, and that I saw the real Cuba instead of just lying on a beach to sip mojitos like most tourists,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cOn the other hand, they were upset about the island\u2019s physical decay.\u201dSteven Andrew Garcia, a photographer and video director in Los Angeles, went on the CubaOne trip, too. His father was not thrilled. Like many Cuban exiles, Mr. Garcia\u2019s father is deeply distrustful of the Cuban government and feared for his son\u2019s safety.\u201cMy dad questioned who would be financing and coordinating this trip,\u201d said Mr. Garcia, 29. When he made it clear to his father that he had made his decision and intended to go, his father urged him to be careful, telling him, \u201cJust stay with the group and don\u2019t get lost.\u201dVanessa Garcia, now a 37-year-old writer (who is not related to Mr. Garcia), learned the hard way that her mother would take issue with her traveling to Cuba. Back in 2009, taking advantage of the new law that permitted Cuban-Americans with relatives living in Cuba to visit the island, Ms. Garcia bought a plane ticket to Havana with her sister, and then told her mother, Jackie Diaz-Sampol, about the trip they were going to take in a few weeks.\u201cShe got so, so, so red and had a vein popping out of her head,\u201d Ms. Garcia said of her mother, \u201cand she said: \u2018I am going to have a heart attack. You are going to kill your mother.\u2019 I tore my tickets, even though we paid $500 for each of them and they were nonrefundable, and threw them down the toilet. I couldn\u2019t do that to my mom.\u201dMs. Diaz-Sampol, now 60, said she fretted over the prospect of her daughter going because she worried about her physical safety. \u201cShe was na\u00efve, in my opinion, thinking you could go to Cuba like any other country,\u201d she said.They reached a d\u00e9tente of sorts in 2014, when the mother and daughter traveled back to Cuba together. (And when Ms. Garcia decided to travel to Cuba last May, she hatched a plan to avoid maternal interference: She waited until the night before she left to tell her mother and stepfather of her plans.)Not all younger Cuban-Americans are eager to visit. For Michelle Marie Arean, a 35-year-old associate editor at Recommend, a travel trade publication based in Miami, the stories she grew up hearing, about government raids of the family home and how her grandfather was exiled to a sugar cane farm where he was abused, were enough to turn her off. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to give money and support to a government that took so much away from my family,\u201d she said. She said she would go if the leader is ousted.It\u2019s a stance that baffles her non-Cuban friends and colleagues, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s opened my eyes to how many people who are not of Cuban descent simply do not understand what our families went through,\u201d she said.Many of those who are opposed to visiting Cuba say they would change their minds if there were a new, non-Communist government. But Aliza Wechsler, 31, has a different condition: She will travel there only if her mother, who left Cuba when she was 7, goes, too.\u201cI would regret it for the rest of my life if I didn\u2019t go with her and see it through her eyes,\u201d said Ms. Wechsler, who lives in New York. At least a few times a month, she said, she calls or emails her mother to ask her if they can start to plan a trip.Ms. Wechsler\u2019s mother, Lily Wechsler, a 63-year-old banker in Miami, said she would like to visit Cuba with her daughter, in a few years when prices become more reasonable.But just as Aliza wishes to travel there with her, Lily wishes to return to Cuba with her oldest sister, who escaped Cuba when she was 20, immediately after her honeymoon. But her sister, Lily said, refuses to go back.\u201cWe do disagree,\u201d she said. \u201cI do try to convince her. Ideally I would want to go with her because just like Aliza is waiting to go with me so I can make the experience meaningful, for me, I would have loved to go with her because she would have given it a lot more meaning.\u201dShe added, \u201cBut that\u2019s not going to happen unless both Castros die tomorrow and communism stops.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But as far as Google Maps is concerned, it actually had not been.\u201cThere has never been a \u2018Palestine\u2019 label on Google Maps, however we discovered a bug that removed the labels for \u2018West Bank\u2019 and \u2018Gaza Strip,\u2019 \u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re working quickly to bring these labels back to the area.\u201d It is unclear if that bug played a role in spurring the online outrage.Elizabeth Davidoff, a spokeswoman, said in an email that the company had also never used the label \u201cPalestinian territories\u201d on its maps. The bug affecting the words \u201cGaza Strip\u201d and \u201cWest Bank\u201d persisted on Wednesday, but when Google Maps functions properly both areas are labeled and separated from Israel by a dotted line to signify that their borders are not internationally recognized.The word \u201cPalestine\u201d was recently removed from the local home page of the company\u2019s search engine, but the reason was aesthetic, not political, Ms. Davidoff said. It was taken down to make space for an Olympics-themed Google doodle, a design that sometimes greets users, as were country-specific tag lines for every country in the world.\u201cThere\u2019s no Google-wide effort to remove Palestine or anything like that,\u201d Ms. Davidoff said in an email. She said a GIF circulating online (and shared by the activist group Jewish Voice for Peace) that claimed to show a before-and-after image that proved the alleged deletion, was fake.So, how did this happen?Part of it is a by-now familiar dynamic on social media. People are inclined to believe claims that reinforce their pre-existing beliefs, especially if they produce an emotional response.Kate Klonick, a resident fellow at the Information Society Project at Yale Law School, said the cycle of outrage on social media is \u201creactive, its emotional, its not particularly thoughtful, but it is satisfying in a lot of ways for people.\u201dAnd few issues are more emotionally fraught than the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, one of the most intractable and heated disputes in international affairs. The anger of Google\u2019s critics was unlikely to be soothed by the facts of this case, Ms. Klonick said.\u201cIf you were upset that you thought Google removed Palestine, it does not ameliorate your anger at all to find out they never had Palestine there to begin with,\u201d she said.Emad Zakaria, who wrote the statement, said he heard the claim that Google removed the word \u201cPalestine\u201d from the website of a Palestinian organization in Lebanon whose name he could not remember.\u201cAnyone looking for Palestine on Google will not be able to find it,\u201d he said.Still, the initial source of the outrage remains a mystery.The claims about Google had extra emotional weight because they involved a visual representation of Israel and Palestine, Ms. Dann said. \u201cMaps have always been political, and the ways that borders are demarcated on them is always political,\u201d she said.Rami Nazzal contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Ellison, Oracle\u2019s brash executive chairman, is still an outsize personality at the company he co-founded, Mr. Kurian has been the key figure in Oracle\u2019s attempted reinvention, overseeing sweeping changes in its engineering. That includes the creation of a network of 21 data centers around the world, a project that has cost perhaps $15 billion. NetSuite is Oracle\u2019s first major acquisition intended to tie right into this new global system.\u201cMoney isn\u2019t the problem for us,\u201d said Mr. Kurian, who is Oracle\u2019s president of product development. He added that \u201cbetween 2004 and 2014 we spent some $40 billion to $45 billion on acquisitions.\u201dOracle became a giant by selling directly to businesses software packages that do things like manage the books and keep track of customers. Now most industry experts think the company needs to show that it is finally in a position to rein in competitors that have been stealing customers away with fresher technology delivered over the internet, a concept called cloud computing.And the trade-offs Oracle must now make \u2014 accepting lower profit margins because customers are less interested in the older, pricier technology \u2014 reflect the hard decisions many older tech companies must make to avoid getting left behind.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt Oracle moved late,\u201d said Al Hilwa, an analyst at IDC. \u201cThey had doubts about the business, and the profit margins, but the way companies are spending forced them to change.\u201dOracle\u2019s new data centers are intended to power a cloud-computing network to compete with the established services provided by the likes of Google, Amazon, Microsoft and IBM. And the NetSuite acquisition could help Oracle pull even with smaller, cloud-focused companies like Salesforce and Workday, which provide their own technology to manage business operations like sales and human resources.Mr. Kurian would seem an unlikely person to play such a key role in one of Silicon Valley\u2019s iconic companies. Born and raised in a middle-class family in Bangalore, India, Mr. Kurian ended his first day in the United States in his freshman dorm room at Princeton University, which he shared with his identical twin, George, who is now chief executive at NetApp, another Silicon Valley company.\u201cThe day we left India was the first day we saw a computer,\u201d said George Kurian, who after graduation worked at Oracle while Thomas Kurian was a consultant at McKinsey. The two also went to Stanford Business School together.Mark V. Hurd and Safra A. Catz, both chief executives at Oracle, manage the company\u2019s sales and finance. Mr. Ellison, who is 71 and shows no inclination to retire, counts on Mr. Kurian to run the core of any big tech company: thousands of engineers.The NetSuite deal is something of a coming-out party for Oracle\u2019s global cloud, possibly signaling the start of a new round of acquisitions, along with hefty spending to keep building out this network. But spending upward of $2 billion a year on building a cloud network, Mr. Kurian said, is table stakes for the biggest tech companies.In NetSuite, Oracle saw a cloud company whose sales of e-commerce and manufacturing software to smaller businesses were stalling as it tried to move into international markets. Oracle figured it could distribute that software efficiently over its cloud. It also hopes to reach smaller companies that can\u2019t afford Oracle\u2019s traditional high-cost, high-maintenance product.Mr. Ellison played no role in the acquisition of NetSuite, according to Oracle, since he owns about 40 percent of that company. Mr. Ellison, who is already worth $45 billion, according to Bloomberg, will reap another $3.7 billion on the NetSuite deal. He still attends regular corporate strategy sessions, along with Mr. Hurd, Ms. Catz and Mr. Kurian, grilling each on their respective portfolios.Oracle has hundreds of different types of software for businesses, but more than anything it is known for powerful databases. Many global airlines, banks and manufacturers wouldn\u2019t function without them.Customers treat the big, Oracle-strength software like sacred objects that should never be altered, while they\u2019re happy to experiment, for example, with a new offering from Amazon. That\u2019s one reason Oracle has a hard time moving toward new technology, said Steve Miranda, Oracle\u2019s vice president of applications development.\u201cNew companies have what is called \u2018a minimum viable product\u2019 they can sell,\u201d said Mr. Miranda, a 24-year veteran at Oracle. At his company, Mr. Miranda said, that minimum is in reality a fairly high-end product.Mr. Kurian, who has been at Oracle for 20 years, is known to move quickly in meetings, seeking slides ahead of a presentation and immediately zeroing in on the one slide where he spots a problem. If there are no problems, the meeting is canceled. Soft-spoken or not, he will let rip a profanity-laced tirade if he sees too many problems.\u201cI won\u2019t comment on the language, but we are very honest with each other, very hard on ourselves and very direct,\u201d said Mr. Miranda. \u201cIf you\u2019re striving to be the best of the best, it comes with the territory.\u201dMuch of that revenue comes from selling bare-bones computing that Oracle doesn\u2019t care about. But increasingly Amazon is offering its own databases, and customers are signing on. It targets Oracle directly at its promotional events, and offers something called \u201cserverless computing,\u201d which charges for applications per line of code rather than monthly fees or upfront licenses \u2014 another potential threat to Oracle\u2019s profit margins.Oracle has built a large operation in Seattle, paying big for cloud talent from Amazon and Microsoft. (Google also has operations there, making Seattle something of the nation\u2019s cloud town.) But local hands there say Oracle isn\u2019t yet a noticeable presence.\u201cRight now, I go to all-day meetings, and their name doesn\u2019t come up,\u201d said Matt McIlwain, a managing director of the Madrona Venture Group, a Seattle venture firm.The next big competition in cloud computing also involves artificial intelligence, fed by loads of data. Soon, Mr. Kurian said, Oracle will offer applications that draw from what it knows about the people whose actions are recorded in Oracle databases. The company has anonymized data from 1,500 companies, including three billion consumers and 400 million business profiles, representing $3 trillion in consumer purchases.\u201cMost of the world\u2019s data is already inside Oracle databases,\u201d said Mr. Kurian.That\u2019s the kind of hold on people\u2019s information that perhaps only Facebook can match. But Mark Zuckerberg doesn\u2019t sell business software. At least, not yet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fifty States of Anxiety", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "Supported byFeeling worried? These days, much of America is.Over the past eight years, Google search rates for anxiety have more than doubled. They are higher this year than they have been in any year since Google searches were first tracked in 2004.So far, 2016 has been tops for searches for driving anxiety, travel anxiety, separation anxiety, anxiety at work, anxiety at school and anxiety at home.Americans have also become increasingly terrified of the morning. Searches for \u201canxiety in the morning\u201d have risen threefold over the past decade. But this is nothing compared with the fear of night. Searches for \u201canxiety at night\u201d have risen ninefold.Over the past few weeks, I\u2019ve taken a break from worrying about my own anxiety to studying our country\u2019s. While I am not sure I totally nailed down why anxiety seems to have risen so much during the Obama era, I did learn a lot.The places where anxiety is highest are not where I would have expected. When I was growing up, if you had asked me which people were the most anxious, I would have said New York Jews. And a decade of interacting with our country\u2019s urban intelligentsia, Jewish and otherwise, has confirmed that pretty much all of us are a neurotic mess.But data has now given me a window into how the rest of the country lives. They\u2019re even worse off. Google searches for anxiety tend to be higher in places with lower levels of education, lower median incomes and a larger part of the population living in rural areas. While the state of New York does have above-average anxiety, it is actually higher in upstate New York than it is in New York City.Searches for panic attacks are overwhelmingly concentrated in less educated, poorer parts of the country, particularly Appalachia and the South. Test-taking anxiety is highest in Arkansas. Searches for \u201canxiety about death\u201d are highest in Kentucky.The epicenter of anxiety, according to Google, is Presque Isle, Me., where fewer than 20 percent of adults hold a bachelor\u2019s degree.The data also suggest that some things I thought for sure would be huge drivers of anxiety turn out not to play much of a role at all. One example: terrorism.I tested how anxiety searches changed after the five largest recent terrorist attacks in the European Union \u2014 Madrid, London, Paris, Brussels and Nice \u2014 each of which killed or injured more than 100 people. In the weeks that followed, there was no rise in anxiety searches in the country that was attacked. I also tested whether anxiety searches rose in Boston after the marathon bombing. They didn\u2019t. Ditto for Orlando, Fla. after the nightclub shooting.Of course, it may be that terrorist attacks terrify people without making them Google about their anxiety, but it still surprised me.Another potential source of anxiety that doesn\u2019t pop up in the data: Donald J. Trump. Many people, I assumed, are anxious over the prospect that Mr. Trump could become president of the United States. And I thought they would express this anxiety through Google. However, while anxiety searches have continued their decade-long rise this year, there was no noticeable change in this trend as the prospect of Mr. Trump\u2019s actually winning became more plausible. Nor have Democratic-leaning parts of the country witnessed an unusually large rise in anxiety searches.I also thought Mr. Trump\u2019s fear-mongering was helping to create fear. Anxiety must have risen after Mr. Trump\u2019s dystopian acceptance speech at the Republican convention last month, right? Not so. There was no increase in searches related to anxiety or panic attacks.In fact, the data suggest that fear-mongering politicians may not create all that much anxiety. Consider the 2004 presidential election between George W. Bush and John Kerry, in which the incumbent continually emphasized the threat of terrorism. I compared anxiety searches in the summer and fall of 2004 in swing states and non-swing states. Swing states, where advertising was concentrated, would have been exposed to far more fear-based messages. But they did not show more anxiety or panic attacks.I did find two factors that cause anxiety. The first \u2014 and this is hardly a surprise \u2014 is a major recession. States that were more deeply affected by the Great Recession saw bigger increases in anxiety during and after the recession. I estimate that each percentage point increase in unemployment is associated with a 1.4 percent increase in anxiety.The second was not something I had thought about, so let me explain how I even stumbled upon the possibility. Google Correlate is a service that makes data available to researchers so that they can test which searches are most frequently made in the weeks a particular search is made. For example, at certain times of year, when people are searching a lot for \u201csweaters,\u201d Google Correlate tells us they are also searching for \u201cscarves,\u201d \u201cfleece pajama pants\u201d and \u201chot cocoa.\u201dA few weeks ago, I put \u201cpanic attack\u201d in Google Correlate, and one of the highest correlated search queries was \u201copiate withdrawal.\u201d Panic attacks are a known symptom of opiate withdrawal, although looking at the striking correlations here, I wonder if they may be an even more common symptom than we had realized.The places with high opiate prescription rates \u2014 and high search rates for opiate withdrawal \u2014 are among the places with the highest search rates for panic attacks. These areas include Appalachia and the South.During years in which many people complained of opiate withdrawal, many people also complained about panic attacks. Interestingly, searches for opiate withdrawal and panic attack have continued to rise over the past few years, even as opiate prescription rates have finally fallen.Searches for opiate withdrawal consistently start high at the beginning of the year. They mostly drop through the year, although they rise in the summer and then surge around Christmas. New Year\u2019s resolutions and doctor vacation schedules may play roles in these patterns. Searches for panic attacks follow a similar pattern, although there is less of a rise around Christmas.To be honest, I still don\u2019t know what to make of this huge rise in anxiety-related searches. I have a lot of questions. Has fear of a black president contributed? Is anxiety contagious \u2014 if someone loses her job and gets anxious, are her kids and friends likely to become more anxious as well? Is anxiety subject to tipping points and bubbles? How much of a role is the return of heroin playing in the rise of panic attacks?Before I look into this further, though, I will take a break from working and instead indulge in my own favorite 2016 habit. I\u2019m going to pace the streets of New York and fret.Advertisement"}

The hope is that the money will be an incentive to keep those flaws out of the hands of organized groups or spy agencies willing to pay big money to learn about them.But Apple had stayed away from the practice. Instead, it had credited anyone who turned over bugs by putting their names on its website \u2014 a far cry from the tens of thousands of dollars, and in some cases hundreds of thousands of dollars, companies like Google and Facebook were willing to pay.The annual Black Hat conference, now in its 19th year, is a gathering place for all sorts of experts on computer security, including hackers, tech industry executives and government officials.Dan Kaminsky, a respected security researcher, said in a keynote speech that the industry was falling far short of expectations. The onslaught of regular, high-profile hacks, like the recent penetration of computers run by the Democratic National Committee, is beginning to make customers believe that little can be done to protect them.\u201cWe made promises in technology, and people are starting not to believe them\u201d Mr. Kaminsky told the audience. \u201cEverybody looks busy but the house still burns.\u201d Mr. Kaminsky argued for a cybersecurity equivalent of the National Institutes of Health or a Manhattan Project to fund research.Notably, a fund-raiser for Hillary Clinton coincided with this year\u2019s conference. Tickets for the \u201cHackers for Hillary\u201d fund-raiser were going for anywhere from $100 to $2,700.

{"Headline": "States Vie to Shield the Wealth of the 1 Percent", "Date": "2016-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI have had a Google news alert on that for a couple years,\u201d Mr. Oshins said as he discussed the case from his office in a squat pink complex about a 20-minute drive from the Las Vegas Strip. What animates Mr. Oshins is not the juicy marital feud, but the legal arcana governing a trust in Delaware where the Kloiber family parked assets worth hundreds of million of dollars, sheltered from estate taxes.Although most out-of-town visitors are drawn to the city\u2019s roulette wheels and slot machines, Mr. Oshins and a battalion of tax lawyers, accountants, advisers, trust administrators and bankers cater to an elite clientele that insists on a much more reliable way to build a fortune.With their backing, Nevada has stoked an aggressive rivalry among a smattering of states to babysit the wealth of the nation\u2019s top 1 percent, pressing public officials to pass laws, streamline regulations, lower fees and replace D.M.V.-level service with concierge treatment.Yet even as more and more states seek ways to help the richest Americans protect their wealth from creditors, divorcing spouses and children, as well as some federal and state tax collectors, critics worry that the effort to attract the lucrative trust business is turning into a competitive game of giveaway.\u201cThere is no doubt that many, many jurisdictions are committed to being at the bottom,\u201d said Edward McCaffrey, a professor at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law. \u201cI think the real question now is: \u2018Where is the bottom?\u2019\u201dThe federal government leaves it to each state to draw up its own trust laws, and several have tried to go as far as they can without inciting accusations that they are abetting tax evasion or hiding assets, he said. But in pushing the envelope, they can also run into challenges from courts in other states, including the Kloibers\u2019 home of Kentucky, that have different statutes governing trusts.Still, Nevada \u201cis definitely the most aggressive in my experience in terms of asset protection,\u201d Mr. McCaffrey said.Starting with the absence of any state income tax and resilient secrecy protections, Nevada has added a passel of laws and regulations intended to lure trust business. Individuals who establish so-called irrevocable trusts have more flexibility to transfer assets to a new trust with more favorable terms. Creditors are blocked from access to money held in trusts (making the arrangement also popular among doctors, who worry a malpractice case could bankrupt them). And what are known as dynasty trusts allow the wealthy to pass their fortunes from generation to generation for hundreds of years without paying estate taxes.Defenders of the industry won what was characterized as a \u201cdo or die\u201d battle in 2013, fending off legislation that would have opened up Nevada trusts to future claims from spouses and domestic partners for property settlements, alimony or child support. And Nevada has only a narrow two-year window for creditors to make a claim against a trust\u2019s assets.\u201cIt\u2019s against the law in this state to conceal assets from legitimate creditors,\u201d said Mark A. Hutchison, Nevada\u2019s Republican lieutenant governor, a lawyer himself.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to be aware of phantom threats that could blow up our industry,\u201d he added.Phantom threats, he said, include recent suspicions \u2014 after the leak of the Panama Papers \u2014 that citizens and foreigners are illegally hiding assets in the state.If the revelations were a source of embarrassment, however, they were also a source of free worldwide publicity. \u201cIt\u2019s actually helped us, believe it or not,\u201d said Greg Crawford, president of the Alliance Trust Company in Reno, explaining that Nevada was not as well known internationally for its asset-protection policies as Delaware. \u201cI\u2019ve had more calls from people overseas, established families, who are interested in Nevada.\u201dMr. Crawford disputed the idea that the state\u2019s rules were abetting criminal activities. \u201cThe honest, ethical taxpaying people around the world who simply want privacy are happy to put assets in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cCrooks know they can be confiscated, so it actually serves as a weeding-out process.\u201dMonitoring development in other states and bulking up asset protection laws, said Mr. Hutchison, the lieutenant governor, has dependable bipartisan support. \u201cThe trust business is a big business,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve always viewed it as a way to stimulate the economy.\u201dAlthough trusts generate little public revenue or direct investment in the state, they do provide a steady stream of work for those in the industry. Supporters also say they generate indirect investment by drawing wealthy people who spend money and might invest later on.Robert H. Sitkoff, a Harvard Law School professor, said that in smaller-population states like Delaware, Nevada, South Dakota and Alaska, trust and estate lawyers \u201care an effective and important lobby in a way that would be much harder to replicate in a place like New York, a big state with lots going on.\u201dWith the competition so intense, each state tries to exploit marginal advantages and highlight rivals\u2019 weaknesses.The marketing pitch is not always about keeping up with the neighbors, however. Even as Nevada and Delaware blocked ex-spouses with claims for child support, for example, New Hampshire decided not to follow suit.\u201cWe have reviewed that and said that\u2019s not our policy,\u2019\u201d said William F. J. Ardinger, a lawyer at Rath, Young & Pignatelli who has lobbied for changes in New Hampshire\u2019s trust laws.His state is making a different kind of appeal. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of wealth on the Eastern Seaboard, and New Hampshire fares well in the mind of those families,\u201d Mr. Ardinger said. \u201cThey\u2019ll say, \u2018I went to prep school at Exeter,\u2019 or, \u2018I went to Camp Winaukee as a kid.\u2019\u201cReno is a beautiful place, but it\u2019s not \u2018On Golden Pond.\u2019\u201dThe Las Vegas lawyer Mr. Oshins, who almost makes the Kardashians look shy, is unfazed by such comparisons.\u201cNew Hampshire is a little bit of a wannabe,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re a second-tier state.\u201dFollow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}

Now most industry experts think the company needs to show that it is finally in a position to rein in competitors that have been stealing customers away with fresher technology delivered over the internet, a concept called cloud computing.And the trade-offs Oracle must now make \u2014 accepting lower profit margins because customers are less interested in the older, pricier technology \u2014 reflect the hard decisions many older tech companies must make to avoid getting left behind.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt Oracle moved late,\u201d said Al Hilwa, an analyst at IDC. \u201cThey had doubts about the business, and the profit margins, but the way companies are spending forced them to change.\u201dOracle\u2019s new data centers are intended to power a cloud-computing network to compete with the established services provided by the likes of Google, Amazon, Microsoft and IBM. And the NetSuite acquisition could help Oracle pull even with smaller, cloud-focused companies like Salesforce and Workday, which provide their own technology to manage business operations like sales and human resources.Mr. Kurian would seem an unlikely person to play such a key role in one of Silicon Valley\u2019s iconic companies. Born and raised in a middle-class family in Bangalore, India, Mr. Kurian ended his first day in the United States in his freshman dorm room at Princeton University, which he shared with his identical twin, George, who is now chief executive at NetApp, another Silicon Valley company.\u201cThe day we left India was the first day we saw a computer,\u201d said George Kurian, who after graduation worked at Oracle while Thomas Kurian was a consultant at McKinsey. The two also went to Stanford Business School together.Mark V. Hurd and Safra A. Catz, both chief executives at Oracle, manage the company\u2019s sales and finance. Mr. Ellison, who is 71 and shows no inclination to retire, counts on Mr. Kurian to run the core of any big tech company: thousands of engineers.The NetSuite deal is something of a coming-out party for Oracle\u2019s global cloud, possibly signaling the start of a new round of acquisitions, along with hefty spending to keep building out this network. But spending upward of $2 billion a year on building a cloud network, Mr. Kurian said, is table stakes for the biggest tech companies.In NetSuite, Oracle saw a cloud company whose sales of e-commerce and manufacturing software to smaller businesses were stalling as it tried to move into international markets. Oracle figured it could distribute that software efficiently over its cloud. It also hopes to reach smaller companies that can\u2019t afford Oracle\u2019s traditional high-cost, high-maintenance product.Mr. Ellison played no role in the acquisition of NetSuite, according to Oracle, since he owns about 40 percent of that company. Mr. Ellison, who is already worth $45 billion, according to Bloomberg, will reap another $3.7 billion on the NetSuite deal. He still attends regular corporate strategy sessions, along with Mr. Hurd, Ms. Catz and Mr. Kurian, grilling each on their respective portfolios.Oracle has hundreds of different types of software for businesses, but more than anything it is known for powerful databases. Many global airlines, banks and manufacturers wouldn\u2019t function without them.Customers treat the big, Oracle-strength software like sacred objects that should never be altered, while they\u2019re happy to experiment, for example, with a new offering from Amazon. That\u2019s one reason Oracle has a hard time moving toward new technology, said Steve Miranda, Oracle\u2019s vice president of applications development.\u201cNew companies have what is called \u2018a minimum viable product\u2019 they can sell,\u201d said Mr. Miranda, a 24-year veteran at Oracle. At his company, Mr. Miranda said, that minimum is in reality a fairly high-end product.Mr. Kurian, who has been at Oracle for 20 years, is known to move quickly in meetings, seeking slides ahead of a presentation and immediately zeroing in on the one slide where he spots a problem. If there are no problems, the meeting is canceled. Soft-spoken or not, he will let rip a profanity-laced tirade if he sees too many problems.\u201cI won\u2019t comment on the language, but we are very honest with each other, very hard on ourselves and very direct,\u201d said Mr. Miranda. \u201cIf you\u2019re striving to be the best of the best, it comes with the territory.\u201dMuch of that revenue comes from selling bare-bones computing that Oracle doesn\u2019t care about. But increasingly Amazon is offering its own databases, and customers are signing on. It targets Oracle directly at its promotional events, and offers something called \u201cserverless computing,\u201d which charges for applications per line of code rather than monthly fees or upfront licenses \u2014 another potential threat to Oracle\u2019s profit margins.Oracle has built a large operation in Seattle, paying big for cloud talent from Amazon and Microsoft. (Google also has operations there, making Seattle something of the nation\u2019s cloud town.) But local hands there say Oracle isn\u2019t yet a noticeable presence.\u201cRight now, I go to all-day meetings, and their name doesn\u2019t come up,\u201d said Matt McIlwain, a managing director of the Madrona Venture Group, a Seattle venture firm.The next big competition in cloud computing also involves artificial intelligence, fed by loads of data. Soon, Mr. Kurian said, Oracle will offer applications that draw from what it knows about the people whose actions are recorded in Oracle databases. The company has anonymized data from 1,500 companies, including three billion consumers and 400 million business profiles, representing $3 trillion in consumer purchases.\u201cMost of the world\u2019s data is already inside Oracle databases,\u201d said Mr. Kurian.That\u2019s the kind of hold on people\u2019s information that perhaps only Facebook can match. But Mark Zuckerberg doesn\u2019t sell business software. At least, not yet.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Searching for Feelings \u00e2\u0080\u0094 An Intern Works on Topic and Sentiment Analysis", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "Despite the prestige of an internship with The New York Times, when I signed on to do software development with the Search team \u00e2\u0080\u0094 before I ever stepped in the building \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I assumed I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be working on small projects, fixing bugs that needed to be fixed, and essentially coding only in whatever spare quantity was required. I was perfectly happy to do so, of course, but I was quite prepared to receive piecemeal assignments for completion in small fragments of time.As things turned out, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m writing this while my code is compiling. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been about 25 minutes so far. As orientation to the internship program was phasing out at the beginning of June, I was greeted by the Search team and almost immediately given a swath of personal projects to choose from \u00e2\u0080\u0094 individually-directed, team-assisted tasks that I could spend the full ten-week period of the internship on, with the end goal of leaving the team (and indeed, The Times at large) with a complete tool they could actually integrate and use in the search engine.For many years, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had a pretty serious interest in linguistics, but I never had the chance to do much with it save for taking a few linguistics classes at college. I always wondered if I could apply the skills I was learning as a computer science major to my academic hobby, but the two fields never seemed to cross while I was at school. So, when I was asked which of a selection of projects I wanted to pursue this summer, one prompt \u00e2\u0080\u0094 linguistic sentiment analysis of articles\u00e2\u0080\u0099 subjects \u00e2\u0080\u0094 stood out. My project has a fairly simple goal: to step through any given article published by The New York Times and to return a list of its major subjects or topics and whether the article relays positive or negative sentiment about those topics. On a large scale, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve used the Java-based Lisp dialect Clojure to construct a pipeline from the article itself through SyntaxNet into vaderSentiment \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the output of which is the list of subjects and their positive or negative bent. This output can be integrated into the Times search engine \u00e2\u0080\u0094 those readers interested in seeing the latest uplifting news on some subject will be able to search with a positive filter, and those who want to read more sobering news about a given figure will be able to search with a negative filter. The project has, thus far, been an incredible opportunity to work with cutting-edge programs in the field of computational linguistics \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never had the chance to study in school \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and to build a library of tools that The Times can implement as they see fit. I hope to walk away from the experience with a new swath of knowledge and experience in this technology, and that The New York Times finds good reason to deploy my project. But above all, I hope that it eventually provides value for the readership of The Times, and that this additional search feature improves improves our ability to understand our entire text corpus.Isaac Pena is a summer intern on the Search team.

{"Headline": "From False Alarm to Panic: Inside Kennedy Airport\u2019s Chaotic Night", "Date": "2016-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJennifer Rosen was scheduled to depart Kennedy International Airport on an 8:55 p.m. flight to San Francisco but instead found herself stuck at Gate C62 in Terminal 2. It was the typical misery of summer airline travel \u2014 or so it seemed.A short distance way away, in another terminal, something more unpredictable than the weather had begun to sweep across the New York airport:Panic.It spread quickly and without warning.By the time Sunday night was over, Ms. Rosen, 32, had sprawled out under a table seeking cover, followed a crowd of people who bolted through a secure door onto the tarmac, frantically called her sister to find out what was happening and tell her that she was alive, and, finally, made a mad dash from the terminal to join mobs of travelers who thought they might be living through an episode of terror.In the end, it proved to be a false alarm.While the authorities were still trying to piece together exactly how a report of gunfire at 9:34 p.m. outside the security checkpoint at Terminal 8 led to complete turmoil across one of the nation\u2019s busiest airports, the accounts of passengers in interviews and on social media offered a lesson in the anatomy of fear.It was a night of confusion and dread, informed by the latest headlines \u2014 including reports of recent attacks on airports in Brussels and Istanbul \u2014 as much as fact. In the absence of official information or instructions, unconfirmed reports from social media fueled the hysteria.Officials said there was no evidence that what took place at Kennedy Airport was the result of a hoax. It was, rather, a sign of the times.\u201cRight now, what is being concentrated on is the investigation into what the catalyst of the incident is,\u201d said Joe Pentangelo, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the airport.Joe Haviland was at Terminal 8 seeing off his family when the first wave of panic hit.People nearby had been gathered watching the Olympics, as Usain Bolt of Jamaica made his bid for a third gold medal in the 100-meter dash.\u201cWe heard a big celebration,\u201d Mr. Haviland told Fox News shortly after being evacuated.He described hearing something like a loud pop, followed by the sight of a herd of people running his direction.\u201cWhen you see 80 people come running around the corner,\u201d he said, \u201cand they break a door to get out, you think \u2018Oh my God, what is happening?\u2019\u201dHe said he saw \u201cpeople working for the airline taking off their shirts,\u201d and saying, \u201cThis is not worth it, I am leaving.\u201dWithin minutes, he said, police officers with their guns drawn were shouting, \u201cShow me your hands!\u201dThe bomb squad soon arrived, and the area was evacuated.But inside Terminal 8, by the departure gates, many passengers had no idea anything was wrong.Judy Rothman Rof\u00e9, who had been visiting her son in Brooklyn and was waiting for an American Airlines flight back to Los Angeles, was waiting by Gate 33.Around 10 p.m., a passenger nearby was checking the internet and told her it seemed their flight was not delayed because of the weather.\u201cThere is a shooter at large,\u201d she was told.Still, she said, as the news filtered out, people around her were relatively calm. \u201cIt was business as usual in our section of the terminal,\u201d she said.Until it wasn\u2019t.Shortly after 11, she said, \u201cwe heard screaming.\u201d It was unclear what set off the wave of panic, but suddenly the eerie calm turned to chaos.\u201cLots of screaming, crying, mass hysteria,\u201d she said. The gate agents, she said, were nowhere to be found; passengers threw themselves under counters and huddled under chairs.After several minutes, an announcement came over the public address system, ordering passengers to leave their bags, put their hands above their heads and evacuate.As she left, she said, scores of law enforcement officers, weapons drawn, were heading into the terminal.Around the same time, Terminal 1 was also officially evacuated, sending hundreds of people into the street outside the airport, unsure what was happening.The Port Authority said that those were the only two terminals evacuated, but that the panic spread quickly to the rest of the airport.In Terminal 2, where Ms. Rosen was waiting for her San Francisco-bound Delta Air Lines flight, everything seemed normal nearly an hour after the first calls to 911 about a possible gunman. It was around 10:30 p.m. when someone screamed, \u201cShots!\u201d\u201cEveryone started screaming and yelling,\u201d Ms. Rosen said. \u201cI dove under this desk space like everyone else.\u201cThen this guy came running over,\u201d she added. He was not an airport employee or an official, but he had an urgent warning. She recalled that he shouted: \u201cThey\u2019re coming! Let\u2019s go this way!\u201dNot knowing who \u201cthey\u201d might be and not wanting to find out, Ms. Rosen and about a dozen others followed the man through a secure door and onto the tarmac, leaving their belongings behind.\u201cThere were no announcements, nothing,\u201d she said. All she could hear was an ear-piercing alarm.She waited with about 20 others on the hot, humid tarmac. \u201cI called my sister, freaking out,\u201d she said. \u201cI told her I am on the tarmac, people are saying there are gunshots. I think I am safe. If you see news about this, I am O.K.\u201dThe crowd was searching Google and social media when a man \u2014 she thought he was a pilot \u2014 finally said they should return. \u201cPeople were like, \u2018I don\u2019t want to go back inside,\u2019\u201d she said.Still, when the man opened the door, they found things just as chaotic as when they left. A flood of people were running in a single direction, she said. Out of the terminal.Once again she followed the crowd. There were \u201cjust mobs of people,\u201d she said.She spotted a man in a Transportation Security Administration shirt and asked him what was happening. \u201cYou probably have a better idea than I do\u201d was his response, she said.Finally, a little after midnight early on Monday, employees were allowed back inside the airport. Passengers were permitted to collect their belongings.It would take time for operations to fully resume. And thousands of passengers still needed to figure out what to do next. There were no trains running. The Van Wyck Expressway leading to the airport was closed. Cabs were just starting to trickle back.Eventually, Ms. Rosen climbed in a cab with several others and made her way to her twin sister\u2019s apartment in the city.As she prepared to set off for the airport again on Monday morning, she was a bit more leery about the procedures that might be in place in the event of an actual emergency.\u201cI understand situations like this are inherently chaotic, but the lack of communication and guidance just compounded an already tumultuous and traumatic experience,\u201d she said. \u201cAt least in our terminal, they should have had enough time to get a coordinated plan together. But they didn\u2019t, and that caused a lot of unnecessary panic and heartache.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Endorsed on Instagram by a Kardashian, but Is It Love or Just an Ad?", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe millions of people who follow Kim Kardashian West and her sisters on social media have become accustomed to seeing them praise everything from fat-burning tea to gummy vitamins for healthier hair.But in the last week, close watchers of the sisters\u2019 accounts may have noticed a small addition to those laudatory messages about the latest miracle product: \u201c#ad.\u201dFor marketers contending with consumers who use ad blockers online and have cut the cord to their TVs in favor of streaming services, social media has become a way to reach an elusive audience. Brands such as Jack in the Box and Red Bull have proved willing to pay thousands of dollars per social media mention to people like the Kardashians and other so-called influencers who command big, loyal followings on services like Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube.These mentions, however, are often presented as testimonials rather than advertisements, a practice that at least one consumer advocacy group has claimed is deceptive. And the Federal Trade Commission has found itself struggling to articulate exactly how these sorts of paid brand endorsements should be handled to ensure that they are identified as ads.\u201cWe\u2019re not prescriptive about that,\u201d said Mary K. Engle, the F.T.C.\u2019s associate director for advertising practices. \u201cBut it has to be unambiguous.\u201dFor example, simply saying \u201cthank you\u201d to a brand or adding \u201c#sp\u201d or \u201c#spon\u201d probably isn\u2019t clear enough, while saying a brand is a \u201cpartner\u201d probably is, she said.The gray area was on display last week when Kylie Jenner changed a caption on an Instagram picture of a lavish mansion in Turks and Caicos from \u201cThanks for the birthday home, @airbnb\u201d to \u201cThanks for the gift of a lovely birthday home, @airbnb.\u201d After a lawyer for the sisters received an Aug. 17 letter from TruthinAdvertising.org, they also edited the captions on at least a dozen other Instagram photos and deleted others.Michael Kump, a lawyer for the sisters, confirmed on Wednesday that he was talking with TruthinAdvertising.org.Audiences \u201chave a very visceral reaction to \u2018#ad\u2019 or \u2018#spon\u2019 or whatever it is, where they don\u2019t want to know people are getting paid for stuff even if they are,\u201d said Jaclyn Johnson, president of creative services at Small Girls PR, where she connects brands like L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris and Urban Decay cosmetics to influencers who have large social media followings. \u201cA few bloggers we work with say, \u2018I want you to know, my engagement on posts that are tagged \u201c#ad\u201d or \u201c#spon\u201d get lower engagement than if that wasn\u2019t there.\u2019\u201dBrands are \u201ctoeing this line of how to make it come across as authentic but also in line with the legalese of social media endorsements,\u201d Ms. Johnson added.The company has counted more than 200,000 Instagram posts a month since January tagged with \u201c#ad,\u201d \u201c#sp\u201d or \u201c#sponsored\u201d \u2014 and that does not include those that were not properly marked. Any one brand could be working with thousands of influencers, said Ms. Engle of the F.T.C., and most are not reality television stars.\u201cMost of them are just more or less regular people,\u201d she said.Shaun McBride, a 29-year-old who is known as Shonduras on social media, has worked with companies like Google and Red Bull on campaigns on Snapchat, where he said he had about 700,000 followers. His posts feature him doing activities like skateboarding and launching homemade rockets, as well as photos of his infant daughter and cereal.For top Snapchat users, brands will start rates \u201cat around $10,000\u201d for a story, he said, referring to a collection of images and videos that disappear after 24 hours. He said he did at least five of those a month.\u201cAll brands have always been worried about the F.T.C. guidelines, but I definitely think they\u2019re focusing on it more,\u201d Mr. McBride said. \u201cRecently, it\u2019s like, \u2018Can you have \u2018#sponsored\u2019 on the first snap and the last snap?\u2019 Or \u2018Can you put \u2018#ad\u2019 on every single snap in the corner?\u2019\u201dThat makes Mr. McBride even more inclined to make paid posts \u201cvery, very obvious.\u201d That could, for instance, mean thanking Red Bull for a free trip to Hawaii. Otherwise, posts with \u201c#ad\u201d or \u201c#sponsored\u201d can give his followers an \u201cuncomfortable feeling,\u201d he said.Disclosures can also be complicated as brands increasingly give creative leeway to social media stars. Jack in the Box, for example, told investors and analysts in May about its work with the YouTube star Miranda Sings, who created a passionate serenade for one of its hamburgers called \u201cSexy Buttery Love Song.\u201d It surpassed a million views, and she later performed it in concert, executives told the investors and analysts.Her YouTube post description includes a line that says, \u201cThis video is sponsored by Jack in the Box,\u201d and that same line appears in the corner of her video after the two-minute mark.\u201cIt would definitely be awesome to see specific examples on every single platform so you don\u2019t have issues like the Warner Bros. one,\u201d said Krishna Subramanian, a founder of Captiv8. \u201cIf there were very clear definitions of what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong, then we as an industry could embrace it and help move things forward.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fifty States of Anxiety", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFeeling worried? These days, much of America is.Over the past eight years, Google search rates for anxiety have more than doubled. They are higher this year than they have been in any year since Google searches were first tracked in 2004.So far, 2016 has been tops for searches for driving anxiety, travel anxiety, separation anxiety, anxiety at work, anxiety at school and anxiety at home.Americans have also become increasingly terrified of the morning. Searches for \u201canxiety in the morning\u201d have risen threefold over the past decade. But this is nothing compared with the fear of night. Searches for \u201canxiety at night\u201d have risen ninefold.Over the past few weeks, I\u2019ve taken a break from worrying about my own anxiety to studying our country\u2019s. While I am not sure I totally nailed down why anxiety seems to have risen so much during the Obama era, I did learn a lot.The places where anxiety is highest are not where I would have expected. When I was growing up, if you had asked me which people were the most anxious, I would have said New York Jews. And a decade of interacting with our country\u2019s urban intelligentsia, Jewish and otherwise, has confirmed that pretty much all of us are a neurotic mess.But data has now given me a window into how the rest of the country lives. They\u2019re even worse off. Google searches for anxiety tend to be higher in places with lower levels of education, lower median incomes and a larger part of the population living in rural areas. While the state of New York does have above-average anxiety, it is actually higher in upstate New York than it is in New York City.Searches for panic attacks are overwhelmingly concentrated in less educated, poorer parts of the country, particularly Appalachia and the South. Test-taking anxiety is highest in Arkansas. Searches for \u201canxiety about death\u201d are highest in Kentucky.The epicenter of anxiety, according to Google, is Presque Isle, Me., where fewer than 20 percent of adults hold a bachelor\u2019s degree.The data also suggest that some things I thought for sure would be huge drivers of anxiety turn out not to play much of a role at all. One example: terrorism.I tested how anxiety searches changed after the five largest recent terrorist attacks in the European Union \u2014 Madrid, London, Paris, Brussels and Nice \u2014 each of which killed or injured more than 100 people. In the weeks that followed, there was no rise in anxiety searches in the country that was attacked. I also tested whether anxiety searches rose in Boston after the marathon bombing. They didn\u2019t. Ditto for Orlando, Fla. after the nightclub shooting.Of course, it may be that terrorist attacks terrify people without making them Google about their anxiety, but it still surprised me.Another potential source of anxiety that doesn\u2019t pop up in the data: Donald J. Trump. Many people, I assumed, are anxious over the prospect that Mr. Trump could become president of the United States. And I thought they would express this anxiety through Google. However, while anxiety searches have continued their decade-long rise this year, there was no noticeable change in this trend as the prospect of Mr. Trump\u2019s actually winning became more plausible. Nor have Democratic-leaning parts of the country witnessed an unusually large rise in anxiety searches.I also thought Mr. Trump\u2019s fear-mongering was helping to create fear. Anxiety must have risen after Mr. Trump\u2019s dystopian acceptance speech at the Republican convention last month, right? Not so. There was no increase in searches related to anxiety or panic attacks.In fact, the data suggest that fear-mongering politicians may not create all that much anxiety. Consider the 2004 presidential election between George W. Bush and John Kerry, in which the incumbent continually emphasized the threat of terrorism. I compared anxiety searches in the summer and fall of 2004 in swing states and non-swing states. Swing states, where advertising was concentrated, would have been exposed to far more fear-based messages. But they did not show more anxiety or panic attacks.I did find two factors that cause anxiety. The first \u2014 and this is hardly a surprise \u2014 is a major recession. States that were more deeply affected by the Great Recession saw bigger increases in anxiety during and after the recession. I estimate that each percentage point increase in unemployment is associated with a 1.4 percent increase in anxiety.The second was not something I had thought about, so let me explain how I even stumbled upon the possibility. Google Correlate is a service that makes data available to researchers so that they can test which searches are most frequently made in the weeks a particular search is made. For example, at certain times of year, when people are searching a lot for \u201csweaters,\u201d Google Correlate tells us they are also searching for \u201cscarves,\u201d \u201cfleece pajama pants\u201d and \u201chot cocoa.\u201dA few weeks ago, I put \u201cpanic attack\u201d in Google Correlate, and one of the highest correlated search queries was \u201copiate withdrawal.\u201d Panic attacks are a known symptom of opiate withdrawal, although looking at the striking correlations here, I wonder if they may be an even more common symptom than we had realized.The places with high opiate prescription rates \u2014 and high search rates for opiate withdrawal \u2014 are among the places with the highest search rates for panic attacks. These areas include Appalachia and the South.During years in which many people complained of opiate withdrawal, many people also complained about panic attacks. Interestingly, searches for opiate withdrawal and panic attack have continued to rise over the past few years, even as opiate prescription rates have finally fallen.Searches for opiate withdrawal consistently start high at the beginning of the year. They mostly drop through the year, although they rise in the summer and then surge around Christmas. New Year\u2019s resolutions and doctor vacation schedules may play roles in these patterns. Searches for panic attacks follow a similar pattern, although there is less of a rise around Christmas.To be honest, I still don\u2019t know what to make of this huge rise in anxiety-related searches. I have a lot of questions. Has fear of a black president contributed? Is anxiety contagious \u2014 if someone loses her job and gets anxious, are her kids and friends likely to become more anxious as well? Is anxiety subject to tipping points and bubbles? How much of a role is the return of heroin playing in the rise of panic attacks?Before I look into this further, though, I will take a break from working and instead indulge in my own favorite 2016 habit. I\u2019m going to pace the streets of New York and fret.Advertisement"}

Her 2004 essay collection, \u201cArea Code 212,\u201d and various of her comic novels have satirized New York social climbers\u2019 ruthless pursuit of wealth and nice apartments. This memoir \u2014 which spans her childhood (partly spent in 1968 Israel, where her family was booted from a hotel for not paying), her adventuresome youth (she had a fling with a 63-year-old Lawrence Durrell when she was 19), her career struggles and successes, and her more recent life as caretaker to her dying mother \u2014 shows that she comes by her obsession with money honestly.As a quirky lit-world \u201cit girl\u201d (her charming, wacky Letterman appearances hold up), Janowitz enjoyed a glamorous lifestyle. But she always positioned herself as a misfit outsider. Not for nothing did Janowitz appear in her heyday on the cover of New York magazine beside a slab of meat. Here she punctures myths of the erstwhile art-party scene. Studio 54 was indeed hip, she writes, though you had to be careful on the dance floor, lest you slip, or somebody \u201csuddenly shove a popper up your nose.\u201dNow, exiled in upstate New York, coping with her beloved mother\u2019s decline and embroiled in a series of real estate-based dramas, she enjoys little besides horseback riding and mocking the psychotic organization of her local supermarket. A witty recurring visual joke is made of the aisle signs on which \u201ccold beer\u201d and \u201cimported beer\u201d are listed separately, as are \u201cbuns\u201d and \u201cbread.\u201d Otherwise, she feels the absence of love and, especially, money in her life. On both counts, she blames her family.Her father, a gun-toting psychiatrist, she describes as rage-filled when not high, sexually inappropriate with her and his female patients and emotionally abusive (in \u201chate letters\u201d he calls her worthless). Her doctor-brother and stay-at-home sister-in-law come off as somehow worse. \u201cThere is no such thing as a happy family,\u201d Janowitz says. \u201cI have met happy families, and after a few minutes one of them takes you off to one side to explain the real truth.\u201dBut if her family is Exhibit A in humanity\u2019s capacity for awfulness, she makes her way through the full alphabet, complaining about everyone from a policeman who gave her a ticket for carrying her dog onto the subway to the journalist and editor Mary Cantwell \u2014 \u201ccold, superior and malevolent\u201d \u2014 under whom she worked at Mademoiselle. It\u2019s surprising Janowitz writes of disliking \u201cthat pretentious, obnoxious\u201d Holden Caulfield, when she seems to see the world through his gray-tinted glasses. \u201cIn my opinion,\u201d she writes, \u201call of humankind is one bad genetic experiment.\u201dThe feeling appears to be somewhat mutual. A hospital reports her to Adult Protective Services for suspected elder abuse. An accountant grows irate when Janowitz bounces a check. Her neighbor sends a threatening letter over extreme, perplexing measures Janowitz takes to protect a rhododendron. Her brother sues her for having used her mother\u2019s accounts to pay her own bills, which she learns constitutes fraud. \u201cThere are some people on this planet who irritate others,\u201d Janowitz writes. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t intentional, but I was one of them.\u201dReaders of this book might grow irritated, too. \u201cYou want to have rich friends, if you are poor, but you want to have their money,\u201d she writes, while complaining that Andy Warhol didn\u2019t buy things for her when they went to flea markets. It\u2019s one of several dubious second-person pronouncements. Another: \u201cYou don\u2019t get involved with your apartment neighbors if you can help it.\u201d (Again, Mister Rogers might disagree.)Like a punk arriving late to class with neither paper nor pencil, she raises lack of curiosity to an art form. \u201cI have the book, somewhere,\u201d she says of something she would have included had it been on hand. Of Bob Guccione\u2019s very Google-able mansion, she says, \u201cProbably there are pictures of this somewhere.\u201d The absence of much in the way of exposition raises some questions, like how did she wind up with eight poodles? And does her husband care that she\u2019s dating her contractor?The book is so raw it\u2019s literally unfinished. In place of a conclusion, she has a chapter called \u201cNo Conclusion,\u201d in which she wonders how her brother\u2019s case against her will turn out. In her postscript, rather than tying up loose ends, she describes a visit to a rural strip club, where \u201cbored girls in bikini tops and panties\u201d use antibacterial wipes on the pole. One, \u201creeking of dirty hair,\u201d nuzzles her face. \u201cHow much will I have to pay to keep her away from me?\u201d Janowitz wonders. Upon exiting, she notices that a skunk has sprayed just outside the building. It\u2019s as if she couldn\u2019t resist providing one more piece of evidence that, whether at the trendiest club in Manhattan or the grimiest one in the woods, the world stinks.Ada Calhoun is the author of \u201cSt. Marks Is Dead.\u201d Her essay collection \u201cWedding Toasts I\u2019ll Never Give\u201d will be published next year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Duo Makes Video Calling Between Operating Systems Easier", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixGoogle and Apple have battled each other for years for primacy over mobile users. Apple has proferred its superior devices, like the iPhone. Google has fought back with its Android operating system and a series of mobile apps that are more flexible and compatible with a broader set of devices than Apple\u2019s apps.The app fits squarely into Google\u2019s playbook in mobile. Over the last few years, Google has increasingly offered its important software and internet services, including Google Maps, Google Photos and Google Docs, to iPhone customers. All of those apps were compelling alternatives to Apple\u2019s proprietary apps, like Apple Maps, Photos and Notes, because they work on a wider variety of devices, including Macs, Windows PCs, Android devices and iPhones.Duo is no exception. People can only use FaceTime to call others who have Apple devices. But Duo lets you place video calls between Android and iPhone users, and sizably increases the universe of people with whom you can hold a video conversation.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to worry about whether your call will connect, or if your friend is using the same type of device as you are,\u201d Google said in a statement, in a veiled jab at Apple. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder that nearly half of U.S. adults never make video calls on mobile.\u201dAll of this feeds into Google\u2019s strategy to attract iPhone users over to Android. Google\u2019s apps generally work better on Android devices than on iPhones, so the more that people get hooked on Google\u2019s core apps, the less incentive there is to stay loyal to Apple.Nick Fox, Google\u2019s head of communication products, said the top priority with Duo was to build a great product and to increase the use of video calling among Android users. But he added that making Android more attractive to iPhone owners was a secondary motive. He said that Duo\u2019s appeal was that it was simple to use, fast and more widely accessible.\u201cOur view is video calling should work for everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can only call half the people you know, that\u2019s very limiting.\u201d\u201cOur year-to-date iPhone sales to switchers are the greatest we\u2019ve seen in any nine-month period,\u201d Mr. Cook said in the call, without disclosing precise figures.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment beyond Mr. Cook\u2019s comments.I decided to test Duo to see how the new app plays into the debate about whether iPhone users should consider switching to Android devices. After trying an early copy of Duo and comparing it side by side with FaceTime, I found that Duo was just as intuitive and fun to use as FaceTime, but that it was too early to tell which service was more reliable.A Short HistoryThis is not the first time Google has provided video calling. Google started offering mobile video calling several years ago inside its Hangouts app, which also includes messaging and voice-calling capabilities. The video-calling feature in Hangouts will remain intact.Crystal Dahlen, a Google spokeswoman, said the name Duo conveyed that the app was designed for one-to-one video calling on mobile devices, in contrast to Hangouts, which lets groups of people make video calls over mobile devices and computers. Duo will roll out globally over the next few days.FaceTime, in contrast, is now six years old. When Apple unveiled the video-calling ability in iPhones in 2010, Steven P. Jobs, Apple\u2019s co-founder, said he had dreamed of mobile video calling since he grew up watching \u201cThe Jetsons\u201d and \u201cStar Trek.\u201d Apple later expanded FaceTime to work with iPads and Macs, among other Apple products. The company has not published statistics on FaceTime use, but the technology helped make mobile video calling mainstream.Duo Versus FaceTimeThe Duo app is downloadable and free through Google\u2019s Play store and Apple\u2019s App Store. When you open the Duo app, there is just one button: video call. Tapping that loads your contacts list, and from there you can choose whom to call.Duo starts streaming video to a recipient as soon as the call is placed, meaning the person you are calling will be able to see you waving or making faces before he or she picks up. Google calls this feature Knock Knock. It can be disabled in case you have friends who are likely to make inappropriate hand gestures.With FaceTime, you place a call directly through the iPhone\u2019s contacts list or through the separate FaceTime app. The recipient does not see the video streaming until after the call is answered.I placed video calls over Duo and FaceTime over a strong Wi-Fi connection as well as a weak cellular connection. In the tests, the video calls looked clearer on Duo, though that is an unreliable measure because very few people are currently able to use Duo, so the network is unrealistically uncongested. When more people use Duo, we can expect the picture quality to vary depending on network traffic and internet speeds.There is a minor difference for Duo between Android and iPhone users. An Android user receiving a Duo call will see a Knock Knock video on the home screen by default. Those using Apple devices will see a notification on top of the screen and will have to open the Duo app before seeing Knock Knock in action. Otherwise, the app works the same for both Android and iPhone.Against the RestI also compared Duo calls with video calls placed over Microsoft\u2019s Skype and Facebook Messenger. Against those two, Duo\u2019s simplicity won hands down.In Facebook\u2019s Messenger app, the video-calling feature is embedded in the corner of a message box, so it is hard to find and not intuitive to use. In fact, every call I have ever made with Messenger has been by mistake.On Skype, the video-calling feature is in a place similar to Messenger\u2019s, in the corner of a message box. More annoyingly, to find other Skype users you have to manually add them to your Skype contacts list or toggle on an option to synchronize your address book with Skype.The Bottom LineFor now, FaceTime is just as intuitive as Duo so I see no compelling reason to use Duo over FaceTime to call iPhone users.But if I had to video call an Android user, I would use Duo over other video-calling services like Skype or Facebook Messenger, which have more cluttered interfaces than Duo\u2019s single-button approach.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Start-Up Turns to Saffron to Help Afghanistan Regrow", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "Supported byBomb-blasted roads, frequent blackouts, shortages of basic equipment and an untested consumer market are hardly conditions that make for natural entrepreneurial opportunities.Their business is part of a small crop of efforts to help develop Afghanistan\u2019s resource economy.\u201cWe wanted to create something to empower everyday Afghans long after we left,\u201d said Kimberly Jung, one of Rumi Spice\u2019s founders, who said the company\u2019s name was inspired by the 13th-century Persian poet.Saffron is one of the most expensive spices in the world, costing $2,500 to $30,000 a kilogram. A staple in Indian, Moroccan and Persian cuisine, it is also a crucial ingredient in European dishes like Spanish paella and French bouillabaisse.As Americans search out the latest artisanal trends, Afghan saffron is starting to make inroads.The Rumi Spice founders decided to focus on farmers because 80 percent of the Afghan population works in agriculture, according to the United States Embassy in Kabul.Still, starting a business, even a small one, is filled with challenges in Afghanistan. Much business is done based on trust or relationships rather than contracts or agreements. In their case, the founders discovered that some of the contacts they made during their military deployments were receptive to working with them.In addition, electricity blackouts are common, which can render the dryers used in processing useless. The main national highway is both damaged by war and still a prime target of improvised explosive devices, or I.E.D.s, making travel risky.Saffron is expensive because it is difficult to grow and painstaking to harvest. Each amethyst-colored saffron crocus produces just three stigmas. The stigmas are separated by hand from the blossom and then dried into rusty-red threads.About 150 flowers are needed to produce a single gram of saffron. Afghan saffron has a reputation for being particularly flavorful \u2014 in part because of the terrain and harsh climate around Herat, where it is grown.In 2014, Keith Alaniz, an Army engineer officer who worked with regional governments in Afghanistan, approached his friend Ms. Jung, whom he had met while working for the Army Corps of Engineers after Hurricane Sandy in New York, about the idea of marketing Afghan saffron.Ms. Jung had been an Army engineer officer who searched for roadside bombs in Afghanistan. She was then at Harvard Business School with Emily Miller, also a former Army engineer officer, who had assisted Special Operations on night raids.The company\u2019s fourth founder, Carol Wang, had worked in Afghanistan on a World Bank-backed rural development program.The farmers were skeptical at first, Ms. Jung said, because they had seen \u201cpeople come and go with many promises.\u201dBut Ms. Miller said, \u201cOnce they started seeing we could really sell the product, the farmers started knocking on our doors.\u201dRumi Spice worked with 34 farmers in 2015. The company plans to work with more than 80 farmers for this year\u2019s harvest in October and November.The processing plant, based in Herat, employed 75 Afghan women in 2015. The company paid their wages directly to them rather than following the more common Afghan practice of paying the male head of the household. About 300 to 400 women will be hired for the 2016 harvest.Rumi Spice was initially set up as a limited liability company. A year later, the founders switched it to a public benefit corporation. They were drawn by the idea that the company would be \u201crequired by law to report profit and impact every two years\u201d to shareholders, Ms. Miller said.In 2016, Rumi Spice is on track to reach its projected revenue of $500,000 for the year. The founders say that it became profitable three months ago.Two of the founders, Ms. Jung and Ms. Miller, are full time and based in the United States, while the other two work with them part time. The company also has two additional full-time employees based in Chicago and Afghanistan.Rumi Spice has hired locals to help provide security for the operations in Afghanistan.Abdul Shakoor Ehrarri, an agricultural specialist, manages the saffron processing plant. He also meets with new farmers and helps recruit female employees by going for tea with their husbands, fathers or brothers to assure them that they will be safe in the workplace.It also helps that Herat, the saffron region where the plant is based, is one of the most stable in Afghanistan.Beyond security, the Rumi Spice team says that another challenge is educating American consumers about saffron. \u201cThe average consumer is very skeptical of anything from Afghanistan,\u201d Ms. Miller said.Chefs, however, have been receptive. Many already used high-quality saffron and were curious to try the Afghan variety.In 2015, soon after Ms. Jung returned from a trip to Afghanistan, she took some saffron to the New York chef Daniel Boulud.\u201cI was very pleased by the high quality and the purity of the pistils of Rumi Spice saffron, and the taste was exceptional as well,\u201d said Mr. Boulud, who has been using Rumi Spice saffron in his signature restaurant, Daniel, for over six months. \u201cIt immediately appealed to us to aid the veterans and help the economy in Afghanistan.\u201dFamilyFarmed has helped Rumi Spice refine its brand. \u201cInitially they were helping Afghan farmers by paying a premium price for saffron and displacing opium production,\u201d said Jim Slama, the president of FamilyFarmed. \u201cWe helped them simplify their story. Now they are an ethical luxury brand.\u201dRumi Spice is also exploring new channels to reach customers, such as meal delivery services. \u201cWe are also looking into super-edgy product development,\u201d Ms. Miller said, such as \u201cpremium saffron butter that could go with a fresh Maine lobster.\u201dBut more than the business aspect, Ms. Jung said that the connection to Afghan people has been the highlight of the venture.She remembers a special moment during the saffron harvest last fall. At one point, the younger women working in the new processing plant, some of them teenagers, shyly asked Ms. Jung to play Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s song \u201cIrreplaceable\u201d on her phone.They shut the door, held an impromptu dance party \u2014 and then returned to the time-consuming task of separating the fiery red stigmas from the purple saffron blossoms.Quoting an Afghan saying, Ms. Jung said, \u201cDrop by drop a river is made.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s tenure.\u201cWe believe the E.P.A.\u2019s handling of this matter aggravated the situation, causing undue expense to our agencies,\u201d read the letter, which was signed by Dr. Zucker and Basil Seggos, the state\u2019s environmental commissioner.In particular, Dr. Zucker and Mr. Seggos suggested that the E.P.A. had taken \u201cno less than three different positions regarding PFOA,\u201d causing \u201cgreat public concern, frustration and anxiety.\u201dJudith A. Enck, the agency\u2019s administrator with responsibility for New York, defended the E.P.A.\u2019s performance, noting that it had acted first to warn residents of Hoosick Falls about high levels of PFOA, and advising residents to avoid cooking with or drinking the water. \u201cThere was no confusion between the E.P.A. and the Health Department\u201d about warnings to residents, she said in an interview. \u201cThere was disagreement.\u201dMoreover, Ms. Enck said, the agency\u2019s adjustment of the acceptable level of PFOA in water from 400 parts per trillion to 100 parts to its current long-term level of 70 was not hard to understand. \u201cThe State Health Department are distinguished professionals,\u201d she said. \u201cThey can follow the number of 400 to 70.\u201dState officials have identified the source of the contamination as the Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics plant, a bland structure on the edge of the Hoosic River, not far from the municipal wells that provide Hoosick Falls with its drinking water.Dr. Marcus Martinez, a local physician and another lifelong resident who testified alongside Mr. Hickey, said that he had long noted what he believed to be unusually high rates of cancer in the village. He said that he and Mr. Hickey had brought their concerns, as well as test results, to the attention of village and state officials in 2014, but had been frustrated by a lack of action.\u201cI do believe our citizens were advised incorrectly to consume water that was unsafe for at least for 12 months,\u201d Dr. Martinez said.\u201cSaint-Gobain Performance Plastics remains fully committed to working closely with local, state and federal officials, with a shared focus on ensuring that the people of Hoosick Falls have drinking water that meets or exceeds current advisories set by E.P.A. and New York,\u201d the one-page statement said. \u201cAnd in the investigation of the source and/or sources that is just getting underway.\u201dThat statement \u2014 and the sentiment that the job is unfinished \u2014 seemed evident on Tuesday as Mr. Hickey spoke about what he had hoped to accomplish in trying to discover why his father, who had driven a school bus as a second job, had died.\u201cI think it goes back to kids on the bus,\u201d Mr. Hickey said, pausing to compose himself. \u201cBecause for him, that was his family as well.

{"Headline": "Colson Whitehead on Slavery, Success and Writing the Novel That Really Scared Him", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byColson Whitehead has long had a thing for the metaphoric possibilities of mechanized modes of transport, the more old-fashioned the better.But in his new novel, Mr. Whitehead grabs onto the most richly metaphoric conveyance of all: the Underground Railroad.Mr. Whitehead, 46, may be used to great reviews and enviable prizes, like the MacArthur Fellowship, the so-called genius grant, which he received in 2002. But a few days before Ms. Winfrey\u2019s announcement, he seemed a bit dazed by his impending ride into a bigger spotlight.\u201cI\u2019m having a hard time wrapping my head around how people are responding to the book,\u201d he said during an interview in his home office in Greenwich Village. \u201cI\u2019m someone who just likes being in my cave and thinking up weird stuff.\u201d\u201cThe Underground Railroad\u201d \u2014 published by Doubleday, with a first print run of 200,000 copies \u2014 is written in a more straightforwardly realist mode than many of Mr. Whitehead\u2019s books, which have tended toward high-concept premises, extended set pieces and jokey riffs. It begins with a harrowing depiction of life on a Georgia plantation around 1850, before taking off on a suspenseful journey through several different states with social systems that mash up racial terrors from decades far into the future.There is Whiteheadian weirdness \u2014 hints of strange eugenics experiments; Friday night lynchings staged like vaudeville shows; and a kitschy \u201cliving history\u201d museum, where Cora re-enacts a sugarcoated version of plantation life \u2014 but it creeps in slowly, with a subtlety that may send some readers to Google to check their memories of high school history.\u201cI went back and reread \u2018100 Years of Solitude,\u2019 and it made me think about what it would be like if I didn\u2019t turn the dial up to 10, but kept the fantasy much more matter-of-fact,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted it to be like the slave narratives I read, where you get a very matter-of-fact contemplation of all these weird and horrible things that keep happening.\u201dThe idea for the book came to Mr. Whitehead around 2000, when he had just finished \u201cJohn Henry Days.\u201d\u201cI had the thought, \u2018What if the Underground Railroad were a real train?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI sat on the couch, thinking about it, but it seemed like it would require a lot of real research, and I just wasn\u2019t up to it.\u201dIn the poker book, Mr. Whitehead, who had recently gone through a divorce, styled himself as a hyperactively wisecracking depressive who had a good poker face because, as he put it in the first line, \u201cI am half dead inside.\u201d In person, he comes off as friendly but guarded, and wary of the expectations put on an African-American writer who publishes a big book about race and freedom in the era of Black Lives Matter.He mentioned a bookstore owner from the South who invited him to come down for \u201ca frank talk about race.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m honored by the response to the novel, but I was like, \u2018Can we just talk about the book?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not a representative of blackness, and I\u2019m not a healer.\u201dStill, he describes \u201cThe Underground Railroad,\u201d which he began in earnest in the spring of 2014, as responding to a kind of inner pull. He was about to start another book with another \u201cexistential black dude narrator,\u201d as he put it, but the Underground Railroad idea kept coming to mind.\u201cI thought, why not write the book that really scares you?\u201d he said.After he\u2019d written 100 or so pages of the novel, he let himself watch the movie \u201c12 Years a Slave,\u201d but turned it off in the middle. \u201cSeeing the movie really devastated me,\u201d he said. \u201cI could read about slave atrocities for days and days, but watching actors go through it was almost too much. I felt really messed up about what I was writing.\u201dMr. Whitehead, who is married to Julie Barer, a literary agent, grew up in Manhattan, where his parents ran an executive recruiting firm. He went to mostly white private schools, but spent summers in an African-American beach enclave in Sag Harbor, N.Y. (the inspiration for the novel), where his maternal grandfather, who owned a chain of funeral homes in New Jersey, built a house from materials he hauled out each weekend in his car.Mr. Whitehead said he knew little about his own ancestors\u2019 experiences in slavery. His mother\u2019s family, he said, had included free black tavern owners in Virginia. His father\u2019s family was in Florida by the early 20th century, but how it got there was largely lost \u201cin the mists of time.\u201dHaving children of his own \u2014 his daughter is 11, his son almost 3 \u2014 made slavery more viscerally, and sometimes terrifyingly, real.\u201cThinking about the loss of a child, about how my own children would feel if they saw me beaten to death in front of them, made writing this book very different than it would have been if I had tried it when I was 30,\u201d he said.In \u201cThe Underground Railroad,\u201d he talks about racial progress, and its limits, in a more direct, even prophetic way. Near the end, a character is seen heading for St. Louis \u2014 or, perhaps, Ferguson, Mo., present-minded readers might find themselves thinking.Mr. Whitehead said he saw his closing pages as optimistic, but also realistic.\u201cI find the last pages very hopeful,\u201d he said. \u201cBut still, wherever we go, we\u2019re still in America, which is an imperfect place. That\u2019s the reality of things.\u201dAn excerpt from \u201cThe Underground Railroad\u201d will be published as a special broadsheet section in print on Sunday, Aug. 7; there will be no digital version.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Too Poor to Afford the Internet", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAll summer, kids have been hanging out in front of the Morris Park Library in the Bronx, before opening hours and after closing. They bring their computers to pick up the Wi-Fi signal that is leaking out of the building, because they can\u2019t afford internet access at home. They\u2019re there during the school year, too, even during the winter \u2014 it\u2019s the only way they can complete their online math homework.Last year, the Federal Communications Commission reaffirmed what these students already knew: Access to broadband is necessary to be a productive member of society. In June, a federal appeals court upheld the commission\u2019s authority to regulate the internet as a public utility.The court\u2019s decision is a partial victory. While the ruling ensures that the information superhighway can be maintained for the public interest, it doesn\u2019t help anyone who simply can\u2019t afford to have access to it. As many as one in five Americans remains in the digital dark. To start to tackle that problem, the F.C.C. has recently expanded its Lifeline program to provide subsidies for broadband access..Here in the world\u2019s information capital, New Yorkers are still scrounging for a few bars of web access, dropped like crumbs from a table. With broadband costing on average $55 per month, 25 percent of all households and 50 percent of those making less than $20,000 lack this service at home.People line up, sometimes for hours, to use the library system\u2019s free computers. Go into any library in the nation and you\u2019ll most likely see the same thing. They come to do what so many of us take for granted: apply for government services, study or do research, talk with family or friends, inform themselves as voters, and just participate in our society and culture \u2014 so much of which now takes place online.Our public libraries are charged with providing free access to information, and in recent years we have had to create new ways of doing that. Leaking broadband (frankly, accidentally) onto the branch stoops is not enough.In 2014, working with Mayor Bill de Blasio, and with support from Google and the Knight, Open Society and Robin Hood Foundations, we were able to let our patrons \u201ccheck out\u201d the internet. In all five boroughs \u2014 and also in Maine and Kansas, to see how it might work in more rural settings \u2014 libraries are lending a total of 10,000 cellphone-size Wi-Fi hot-spot devices for up to a year in neighborhoods that are digital deserts. With this access at home, young children and teenagers in our after-school programs and immigrants in our rapidly expanding English classes continue to learn and connect after they exit the library\u2019s doors.Yet we need help from more than libraries. No child can have equal access to education, nor any worker equal access to a job, without access to the internet and the digital training to use it skillfully. Our federal, state and local policies must recognize there can be no full equality without digital equality. We can also require the companies that reach millions of customers via city infrastructure to provide more affordable rates for low-income residents, and to ensure that broadband connections are provided to poor neighborhoods.Another, bolder approach, would be to create Wi-Fi for large geographic areas. Dozens of municipalities, including Philadelphia, Hartford and Minneapolis, have tried to offer Wi-Fi in their entire cities, with mixed success. Under Mayor de Blasio, New York City recently began an innovative program that refashions old public pay phones into Wi-Fi hot spots. Libraries and schools could add to this growing network of free broadband. Perhaps we should project Wi-Fi from every public building, with boosters to create a minimal level of home access as a public utility for all \u2014 and those who can afford a premium service may pay for one.I know there are technological hurdles to providing universal broadband. But the commitment I\u2019m asking for isn\u2019t particularly novel. Early in the last century, the nation\u2019s leaders decided, at no small cost, to bring clean water, then electricity, then phone service to all parts of our country. And from this foundation we built the wealthiest, most productive economy in the world.When New York City was founded by the Dutch, it had two great strengths: a population of varied backgrounds and ideas, and access to information, through its vibrant shipping industry. This is what made us a global city. Today\u2019s technology revolution promises to provide more information, more widely than ever. Yet we have left almost two million New Yorkers in the digital dark.We can fix this. We can realize our city\u2019s full potential in the digital age. And the kids in the Bronx can get their math homework done.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Car Renter\u2019s Costly Detour to Collection Center Drive", "Date": "2016-08-27", "News": "Supported byThe HagglerThis isn\u2019t unusual. When any business appears in this highly uncoveted space, readers often pipe up with letters in the \u201cThat happened to me, too!\u201d vein. The difference here is that new Payless letters describe behavior even more egregious than that previously described here, and that makes a return to the subject somewhat irresistible. You will note this letter goes on at a slightly greater than average length. That is because it contains a slightly greater than average amount of crazy.Q. In April, when I made a Payless Car Rental reservation online, the estimate for seven days was $256. When I got to the Austin, Tex., airport, an employee at the Payless counter asked a few times if I wanted personal liability insurance. I declined it, over and over.But when I returned the car a week later, my bill was $527. The reason? I\u2019d been charged for that insurance and other add-ons that I had said I didn\u2019t want. When I pointed this out to the woman behind the counter \u2014 the same woman who had rented me the car a week earlier \u2014 she said she lacked the authority to remove any charges.Then she did something odd: She took the contract to a back office and never returned with it. Instead, she emerged with a phone number and suggested I call to complain.I disputed the charge with American Express. On June 1, I was informed that the dispute was resolved in my favor and that $222 would be refunded. (Why that figure, and not more, I don\u2019t know.) Payless was undeterred. A week later, I received a letter from the company with the words \u201cDebit advice\u201d written over and over. The address I was told to send money to was \u2014 and this is not a joke \u2014 32961 Collection Center Drive, Chicago, Ill.Worried about my credit rating, I sent the company a certified check. It was cashed.Amazingly, a week later I received another letter, once again demanding that I send a check for $222. Or else.\u201cYour cooperation in this matter is important to continue uninterrupted service of your rental needs,\u201d the letter stated. \u201cIf there is no response within 10 days we will have no alternative but to suspend your rental privileges.\u201dI called the contact person named on the letter, left a message and have heard nothing back.Perhaps the Haggler could get to the bottom of this.A. It\u2019s hard to know where to begin.Suspending your \u201crental privileges?\u201d It seems to the Haggler that this threat would work only on consumers under the mistaken impression that Payless is the only car rental company in the United States.\u201cCollection Center Drive\u201d? Google Maps can\u2019t find it. The Haggler has to assume that the point of this address, along with \u201cDebit advice\u201d \u2014 a phrase that doesn\u2019t make sense \u2014 is to imply that a customer is about to have a collection agency problem.Payless, readers may recall, is owned by Avis Budget, which is based in Parsippany-Troy Hills, N.J. The company\u2019s chief executive is Larry D. De Shon. Avis acquired Payless in 2013, for $50 million, which means that Mr. De Shon and his colleagues have had three years to bring Payless service up to Avis standards \u2014 which are high, in the Haggler\u2019s personal experience.The Haggler contacted Avis Budget\u2019s public relations office and heard from Alice Pereira, a spokeswoman. She was forwarded a copy of the contract and copies of all the letters involved in this dispute. Two weeks later, the Haggler had heard nothing back. After a nudge, Ms. Pereira wrote this email, transcribed in its entirety: \u201cWe have worked directly with the customer to resolve the issue.\u201dThe Haggler was amazed that Payless was not eager, at minimum, to fake some concern. He wrote to Ms. Pereira and urged her to be a bit more expansive. A few days later, she wrote that the company had been working to integrate Payless, efforts that include an upgrade to its fleet and \u201cthe implementation of more standard servicing requirements for those vehicles.\u201dMs. Pereira also stated that Ms. Bertucio had initialed the part of the contract where personal liability insurance is requested. This is true. But Ms. Bertucio did that only after she\u2019d explained that she didn\u2019t want that insurance, and thought her initials merely confirmed that fact.In other words, Ms. Bertucio thinks she was snookered. It seemed to the Haggler that it would behoove Avis Budget to look into the matter. Would Ms. Pereira and the company like to investigate and then send yet another statement?\u201cWe pay close attention to input and feedback from our customers,\u201d Ms. Pereira wrote two days later. \u201cWe will use this rental transaction as an opportunity to reinforce with our associates, at our Payless location in Austin and elsewhere, the importance of ensuring that our customers clearly understand which services and options they are selecting.\u201dTo the Haggler\u2019s ears, this is low on specifics and missing the sincere sense of regret and urgency that this column occasionally hears from companies that want to improve. But another pep talk followed by a another request for yet another statement seemed pointless. Because if Payless is still demanding that customers send money they don\u2019t owe to a street called Collection Center Drive, it has problems that Avis Budget isn\u2019t eager to solve.EMAIL: haggler@nytimes.com or tweet to @TheHagglerNYT.

But there is a flip side to that: Chinese internet companies have had a hard time breaking out of it.Two decades ago, China essentially walled off its internet from the rest of the world. The result helped create an environment where local companies (not to mention censorship) thrived. Today, companies like Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba are among the biggest internet companies in the world.Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba all have offices in the United States, but their most successful efforts so far have been investments and acquisitions.One notable outlier from this trend has been the music start-up Music.ly.

It is hard to tell it is made in China, and that\u2019s intentional: Its makers have largely ignored their home market to make a play for the American audience.There\u2019s a risk to that, of course, because ignoring a country with more than 700 million internet users is not always the wisest decision.Advertisement"}

Brenda Hwang, a friend of the couple who became a Universal Life minister for the event, officiated.Ms. Brooks, 28, is keeping her name. She is an associate specializing in retail law at Sedgwick, a law firm based in San Francisco. She graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, and received her law degree cum laude from the University of Michigan. She is a daughter of Kay U. Brooks of Granite Bay, Calif., and Albert L. Brooks of Roseville, Calif.The groom, 29, is an associate at Exponent, an engineering and scientific consulting firm in Menlo Park, Calif. He also graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, and received a Ph.D. in materials science and engineering from the University of Michigan. He is a son of Karin Kimiecik and Kenneth Kimiecik Jr. of Santa Clara, Calif.In July 2010, Ms. Brooks began a solo backpacking journey that started in Arica, in northern Chile, where she was living with a Chilean family and volunteering as an English teacher at a local high school through a program offered by the Chilean Ministry of Education.While in Chile she also began filing online applications to various law schools in the United States. By the time her backpacking adventure took her to Nicaragua in January 2011, she was starting to hear back from various schools, and would travel to town once a week to look over her responses at an internet cafe.By March, still in Nicaragua, she intensified her research on individual schools. But she found limited success getting individuals to send her feedback through postings she made Google and a travel website called Couchsurfing.com.So she eventually hatched a plan to connect with both male and female students living in the college towns she was targeting: She figured that those she contacted through OkCupid would be more motivated to respond.\u201cIt was a pretty good way to see what the people who could tell me about life at these schools were all about,\u201d she said. \u201cThe site was also free of charge, so I didn\u2019t have to spend any money.\u201dShe said that she was not interested in finding romance, which is why Ms. Brooks did not initially put her photo on the dating site. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t getting much feedback that way,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I eventually decided to use a photo of myself.\u201dWhen she began researching the University of Michigan, she filtered her search for current graduate students in Ann Arbor, which resulted in a 99 percent match with a guy whose profile obscured his face but who was clearly wearing a shirt from U.C. Berkeley, Ms. Brooks\u2019s alma mater.\u201cI thought it was a pretty darn clever idea,\u201d said Mr. Kimiecik, the mystery man in the shirt. \u201cI figured this is a person I should definitely help out.\u201dSo they began corresponding and became online friends.\u201cHe seemed like a pretty cool person, someone I looked forward to talking to,\u201d said Ms. Brooks, whose interactions with University of Michigan-based Mr. Kimiecik, eventually helped her choose to study law there. \u201cHe seemed warm and kind, but I didn\u2019t know what he looked like because all the photos of him were old and taken at odd angles. It was hard to see his face.\u201dA month later, Ms. Brooks returned from Nicaragua to her mother\u2019s home in Granite Bay to prepare for law school. Her online exchanges with Mr. Kimiecik were now replaced by phone calls and texting, \u201cand a little bit of flirting,\u201d according to Ms. Brooks.The more they flirted, the more he grew interested.\u201cShe was charming and intelligent,\u201d he said. \u201cI also found her to be a warmhearted, positive and perceptive person. I kept wanting to know more and more about her.\u201dDespite their regular communications, Ms. Brooks still did not know what Mr. Kimiecik looked like, so she asked him to post a more-recent photo. He replied by sending her a photo of himself wearing ski goggles and a ski jacket, which had a hood covering most of his face.\u201cI thought it was hilarious,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I also found it wildly frustrating.\u201dThough he explained the stunt as \u201ca partial joke,\u201d he added, \u201cMy usual reaction to first meeting someone is to keep them at arm\u2019s length before I start telling them my whole life story.\u201dShe finally got the chance to see him up close when she flew to Michigan, and he picked her up at the airport. Before meeting him at the baggage claim area, she rushed to the bathroom to apply some makeup.\u201cI didn\u2019t put stock in anything, but I was hopeful and I wanted to make a good first impression,\u201d she said.Like the kind of first impression Mr. Kimiecik made on her.\u201cHe was incredibly handsome,\u201d she said. \u201cI was excited to finally be standing next to him.\u201dThey were soon dating and began living together in August 2012. In July 2013, he proposed to her at Point Reyes National Seashore in California, and when she returned to Granite Bay in February 2014 to begin studying for the bar exam, a 19-month long-distance relationship ensued.They were reunited in September 2015, when Mr. Kimiecik, who had earned his Ph.D., went to San Francisco to join Ms. Brooks, who was already working at Sedgwick.\u201cOur long-distance relationship was reaffirming for me,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought back to all of those times I was on my own and didn\u2019t need him, but now I was on my own again, and this time I wanted to be with him.

{"Headline": "Scientists Just Say No to \u2018Chemtrails\u2019 Conspiracy Theory", "Date": "2016-08-15", "News": "Supported byConspiracy theories can be stubborn, particularly in the echo chamber of the internet.One persistent belief in some quarters is that the government \u2014 or business, perhaps \u2014 is deploying a fleet of jet aircraft to spray chemicals into the sky to control the population, food supply or other things.As evidence, they point to what they call \u201cchemtrails,\u201d which are more commonly known as contrails, or condensation trails, produced at high altitudes as water vapor in jet engine exhaust condenses and freezes.Adding fuel to the chemtrails theory is the fact that there are a few legitimate reasons for atmospheric spraying \u2014 \u201cseeding\u201d clouds to make rain, for example \u2014 and in recent years there has been some research on the idea of spraying chemicals as a potential way to fight global warming.The goal, the researchers say, is not so much to change the minds of hard-core believers, but to provide a rebuttal \u2014 the kind that would show up in a Google search \u2014 to persuade other people to steer clear of this idea.Steven J. Davis, a climate scientist at the University of California, Irvine, said he had the idea for the study after a conversation with a salesman at a mattress store.When the man found out what he did for a living, Dr. Davis said, \u201che had very serious questions about what we were going to do about the chemtrails problem.\u201dDr. Davis said that when he got home, he searched the internet for peer-reviewed studies on the conspiracy theory, but found none.The theory has been popularized on websites that display photographs of contrails but are described instead as chemtrails that persist in the atmosphere and contain harmful chemicals like strontium, barium and aluminum.Other evidence cited by these theorists includes documents that are said to be laboratory analyses showing abnormally high levels of these and other chemicals in water and soil samples from areas where spraying is supposed to have taken place.In the study, 77 scientists \u2014 experts in atmospheric chemistry and in the deposition of air pollutants \u2014 were shown some of this evidence and asked whether a chemical spraying program was the simplest explanation for it or whether there were others that were more straightforward.With the photographs, all of the experts chose science over conspiracy theory. For instance, in a photograph of a contrail broken by a gap, chemtrails supporters say the gap is proof the spraying was turned on and off.All of the scientists, however, said there were reasonable scientific explanations for the gap, the most commonly cited being that the aircraft had passed through an area of drier air, which would make that part of the contrail dissipate more quickly.The lab analyses were also dismissed as evidence of a spraying program, although some scientists said there was not enough data to draw any conclusion.And in two cases, an expert thought the analyses might be evidence of spraying. Many of the scientists said that the analyses showed normal, not elevated, levels of the chemicals.The 77 experts were also asked if, in their work or personal life, they had ever seen any evidence for a secret large-scale spraying program. All but one said no.One scientist, who was not identified, said he or she had come across evidence of high levels of barium in the atmosphere in a remote area where soil levels of barium were low.Dr. Davis said it was unclear whether this scientist had concluded that a secret spraying program existed.Mr. West said the new study should help sway people who might otherwise be convinced by a chemtrails website. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to hold back the tide to a certain degree, and hopefully have less people fall into that way of thinking,\u201d he added.Dr. Davis said he viewed this study as the latest effort by scientists to ensure that accurate information is available to counter misinformation from nonscientists.\u201cIt\u2019s incumbent on us as scientists to get scientific perspectives out there,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen with climate change science is that ignoring the deniers hasn\u2019t necessarily been an effective route.\u201dAdvertisement"}

These are news sources that essentially do not exist outside of Facebook, and you\u2019ve probably never heard of them. They have names like Occupy Democrats; The Angry Patriot; US Chronicle; Addicting Info; RightAlerts; Being Liberal; Opposing Views; Fed-Up Americans; American News; and hundreds more. Some of these pages have millions of followers; many have hundreds of thousands.Using a tool called CrowdTangle, which tracks engagement for Facebook pages across the network, you can see which pages are most shared, liked and commented on, and which pages dominate the conversation around election topics. Using this data, I was able to speak to a wide array of the activists and entrepreneurs, advocates and opportunists, reporters and hobbyists who together make up 2016\u2019s most disruptive, and least understood, force in media.Individually, these pages have meaningful audiences, but cumulatively, their audience is gigantic: tens of millions of people. On Facebook, they rival the reach of their better-funded counterparts in the political media, whether corporate giants like CNN or The New York Times, or openly ideological web operations like Breitbart or Mic. And unlike traditional media organizations, which have spent years trying to figure out how to lure readers out of the Facebook ecosystem and onto their sites, these new publishers are happy to live inside the world that Facebook has created. Their pages are accommodated but not actively courted by the company and are not a major part of its public messaging about media. But they are, perhaps, the purest expression of Facebook\u2019s design and of the incentives coded into its algorithm \u2014 a system that has already reshaped the web and has now inherited, for better or for worse, a great deal of America\u2019s political discourse.Occupy got him on Facebook, but it was the 2012 election that showed him its potential. As he saw it, that election was defined by social media. He mentioned a set of political memes that now feel generationally distant: Clint Eastwood\u2019s empty chair at the 2012 Republican National Convention and Mitt Romney\u2019s debate gaffe about \u201cbinders full of women.\u201d He thought it was a bit silly, but he saw in these viral moments a language in which activists like him could spread their message.This year, political content has become more popular all across the platform: on homegrown Facebook pages, through media companies with a growing Facebook presence and through the sharing habits of users in general. But truly Facebook-native political pages have begun to create and refine a new approach to political news: cherry-picking and reconstituting the most effective tactics and tropes from activism, advocacy and journalism into a potent new mixture. This strange new class of media organization slots seamlessly into the news feed and is especially notable in what it asks, or doesn\u2019t ask, of its readers. The point is not to get them to click on more stories or to engage further with a brand. The point is to get them to share the post that\u2019s right in front of them. Everything else is secondary.While web publishers have struggled to figure out how to take advantage of Facebook\u2019s audience, these pages have thrived. Unburdened of any allegiance to old forms of news media and the practice, or performance, of any sort of ideological balance, native Facebook page publishers have a freedom that more traditional publishers don\u2019t: to engage with Facebook purely on its terms. These are professional Facebook users straining to build media companies, in other words, not the other way around.From a user\u2019s point of view, every share, like or comment is both an act of speech and an accretive piece of a public identity. Maybe some people want to be identified among their networks as news junkies, news curators or as some sort of objective and well-informed reader. Many more people simply want to share specific beliefs, to tell people what they think or, just as important, what they don\u2019t. A newspaper-style story or a dry, matter-of-fact headline is adequate for this purpose. But even better is a headline, or meme, that skips straight to an ideological conclusion or rebuts an argument.Rafael Rivero is an acquaintance of Provost\u2019s who, with his twin brother, Omar, runs a page called Occupy Democrats, which passed three million followers in June. This accelerating growth is attributed by Rivero, and by nearly every left-leaning page operator I spoke with, not just to interest in the election but especially to one campaign in particular: \u201cBernie Sanders is the Facebook candidate,\u201d Rivero says. The rise of Occupy Democrats essentially mirrored the rise of Sanders\u2019s primary run. On his page, Rivero started quoting text from Sanders\u2019s frequent email blasts, turning them into Facebook-ready memes with a consistent aesthetic: colors that pop, yellow on black. Rivero says that it\u2019s clear what his audience wants. \u201cI\u2019ve probably made 10,000 graphics, and it\u2019s like running 10,000 focus groups,\u201d he said. (Clinton was and is, of course, widely discussed by Facebook users: According to the company, in the last month 40.8 million people \u201cgenerated interactions\u201d around the candidate. But Rivero says that in the especially engaged, largely oppositional left-wing-page ecosystem, Clinton\u2019s message and cautious brand didn\u2019t carry.)Because the Sanders campaign has come to an end, these sites have been left in a peculiar position, having lost their unifying figure as well as their largest source of engagement. Audiences grow quickly on Facebook but can disappear even more quickly; in the case of left-leaning pages, many had accumulated followings not just by speaking to Sanders supporters but also by being intensely critical, and often utterly dismissive, of Clinton.\u201cIt\u2019s like a meme war,\u201d Rivero says, \u201cand politics is being won and lost on social media.\u201dThis was, for most news organizations, a boon. The flood of visitors aligned with two core goals of most media companies: to reach people and to make money. But as Facebook\u2019s growth continued, its influence was intensified by broader trends in internet use, primarily the use of smartphones, on which Facebook became more deeply enmeshed with users\u2019 daily routines. Soon, it became clear that Facebook wasn\u2019t just a source of readership; it was, increasingly, where readers lived.Facebook, from a publisher\u2019s perspective, had seized the web\u2019s means of distribution by popular demand. A new reality set in, as a social-media network became an intermediary between publishers and their audiences. For media companies, the ability to reach an audience is fundamentally altered, made greater in some ways and in others more challenging. For a dedicated Facebook user, a vast array of sources, spanning multiple media and industries, is now processed through the same interface and sorting mechanism, alongside updates from friends, family, brands and celebrities.From the start, some publishers cautiously regarded Facebook as a resource to be used only to the extent that it supported their existing businesses, wary of giving away more than they might get back. Others embraced it more fully, entering into formal partnerships for revenue sharing and video production, as The New York Times has done. Some new-media start-ups, most notably BuzzFeed, have pursued a comprehensively Facebook-centric production-and-distribution strategy. All have eventually run up against the same reality: A company that can claim nearly every internet-using adult as a user is less a partner than a context \u2014 a self-contained marketplace to which you have been granted access but which functions according to rules and incentives that you cannot control.The news feed is designed, in Facebook\u2019s public messaging, to \u201cshow people the stories most relevant to them\u201d and ranks stories \u201cso that what\u2019s most important to each person shows up highest in their news feeds.\u201d It is a framework built around personal connections and sharing, where value is both expressed and conferred through the concept of engagement. Of course, engagement, in one form or another, is what media businesses have always sought, and provocation has always sold news. But now the incentives are literalized in buttons and written into software.Readers who clicked through to the story were led to an external website, called Make America Great Today, where they were presented with a brief write-up blended almost seamlessly into a solid wall of fleshy ads. Khan, the story said \u2014 between ads for \u201c(1) Odd Trick to \u2018Kill\u2019 Herpes Virus for Good\u201d and \u201c22 Tank Tops That Aren\u2019t Covering Anything\u201d \u2014 is an agent of the Muslim Brotherhood and a \u201cpromoter of Islamic Shariah law.\u201d His late son, the story suggests, could have been a \u201cMuslim martyr\u201d working as a double agent. A credit link beneath the story led to a similar-looking site called Conservative Post, from which the story\u2019s text was pulled verbatim. Conservative Post had apparently sourced its story from a longer post on a right-wing site called Shoebat.com.Within 24 hours, the post was shared more than 3,500 times, collecting a further 3,000 reactions \u2014 thumbs-up likes, frowning emoji, angry emoji \u2014 as well as 850 comments, many lengthy and virtually all impassioned. A modest success. Each day, according to Facebook\u2019s analytics, posts from the Make America Great page are seen by 600,000 to 1.7 million people. In July, articles posted to the page, which has about 450,000 followers, were shared, commented on or liked more than four million times, edging out, for example, the Facebook page of USA Today.Nicoloff\u2019s business model is not dissimilar from the way most publishers use Facebook: build a big following, post links to articles on an outside website covered in ads and then hope the math works out in your favor. For many, it doesn\u2019t: Content is expensive, traffic is unpredictable and website ads are both cheap and alienating to readers. But as with most of these Facebook-native pages, Nicoloff\u2019s content costs comparatively little, and the sheer level of interest in Trump and in the type of inflammatory populist rhetoric he embraces has helped tip Nicoloff\u2019s system of advertising arbitrage into serious profitability. In July, visitors arriving to Nicoloff\u2019s website produced a little more than $30,000 in revenue. His costs, he said, total around $8,000, partly split between website hosting fees and advertising buys on Facebook itself.Terry Littlepage, an internet marketer based in Las Cruces, N.M., has taken this model even further. He runs a collection of about 50 politically themed Facebook pages with names like The American Patriot and My Favorite Gun, which push visitors to a half-dozen external websites, stocked with content aggregated by a team of freelancers. He estimates that he spends about a thousand dollars a day advertising his pages on Facebook; as a result, they have more than 10 million followers. In a good month, Littlepage\u2019s properties bring in $60,000.Nicoloff and Littlepage say that Trump has been good for business, but each admits to some discomfort. Nicoloff, a conservative, says that there were other candidates he preferred during the Republican primaries but that he had come around to the nominee. Littlepage is also a recent convert. During the primaries, he was a Cruz supporter, and he even tried making some left-wing pages on Facebook but discovered that they just didn\u2019t make him as much money.In their angry, cascading comment threads, Make America Great\u2019s followers express no such ambivalence. Nearly every page operator I spoke to was astonished by the tone their commenters took, comparing them to things like torch-wielding mobs and sharks in a feeding frenzy. No doubt because of the page\u2019s name, some Trump supporters even mistake Nicoloff\u2019s page for an official organ of the campaign. Nicoloff says that he receives dozens of messages a day from Trump supporters, expecting or hoping to reach the man himself. Many, he says, are simply asking for money.A dozen or so of the sites are published in-house, but posts from the company\u2019s small team of writers are free to be shared among the entire network. The deal for a would-be Liberty Alliance member is this: You bring the name and the audience, and the company will build you a prefab site, furnish it with ads, help you fill it with content and keep a cut of the revenue. Coca told me the company brought in $12 million in revenue last year. (The company declined to share documentation further corroborating his claims about followers and revenue.)Because the pages are run independently, the editorial product is varied. But it is almost universally tuned to the cadences and styles that seem to work best on partisan Facebook. It also tracks closely to conservative Facebook media\u2019s big narratives, which, in turn, track with the Trump campaign\u2019s messaging: Hillary Clinton is a crook and possibly mentally unfit; ISIS is winning; Black Lives Matter is the real racist movement; Donald Trump alone can save us; the system \u2014 all of it \u2014 is rigged. Whether the Liberty Alliance succeeds or fails will depend, at least in part, on Facebook\u2019s algorithm. Systemic changes to the ecosystem arrive through algorithmic adjustments, and the company recently adjusted the news feed to \u201cfurther reduce clickbait headlines.\u201dFor now, the network hums along, mostly beneath the surface. A post from a Liberty Alliance page might find its way in front of a left-leaning user who might disagree with it or find it offensive, and who might choose to engage with the friend who posted it directly. But otherwise, such news exists primarily within the feeds of the already converted, its authorship obscured, its provenance unclear, its veracity questionable. It\u2019s an environment that\u2019s at best indifferent and at worst hostile to traditional media brands; but for this new breed of page operator, it\u2019s mostly upside. In front of largely hidden and utterly sympathetic audiences, incredible narratives can take shape, before emerging, mostly formed, into the national discourse.Before Hannity signed off, he posed a question: \u201cSo, does that mean anything?\u201d It\u2019s a version of the question that everyone wants to answer about Facebook and politics, which is whether the site\u2019s churning political warfare is actually changing minds \u2014 or, for that matter, beginning to change the political discourse as a whole. How much of what happens on the platform is a reflection of a political mood and widely held beliefs, simply captured in a new medium, and how much of it might be created, or intensified, by the environment it provides? What is Facebook doing to our politics?Appropriately, the answer to this question can be chosen and shared on Facebook in whichever way you prefer. You might share this story from The New York Times Magazine, wondering aloud to your friends whether our democracy has been fundamentally altered by this publishing-and-advertising platform of unprecedented scale. Or you might just relax and find some memes to share from one of countless pages that will let you air your political id. But for the page operators, the question is irrelevant to the task at hand. Facebook\u2019s primacy is a foregone conclusion, and the question of Facebook\u2019s relationship to political discourse is absurd \u2014 they\u2019re one and the same. As Rafael Rivero put it to me, \u201cFacebook is where it\u2019s all happening.\u201dJohn Herrman is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "It\u2019s So Typical", "Date": "2016-08-17", "News": "Supported byWordplayTHURSDAY PUZZLE \u2014 Have you ever stared at a word for so long that it stops looking like that word and starts to look like a completely different word?Parker Lewis has demonstrated a love for slicing, dicing and scrambling words in the four crossword puzzles that have run in The New York Times under his byline, and I have become a big fan.Today he collaborates with Jeff Chen of XWord Info to offer us a puzzle that might require two or more glances at the theme entries to uncover the trick, but it\u2019s well worth your time. I know that it had me snorting all the way through.Today\u2019s three theme clues at 17-, 36- and 53A might seem kind of stretchy, but they actually describe the goings-on in the theme pretty well.If you take a fairly long word like RECONSIDERATION (17A) and slice it up into three parts, what you wind up with (that still makes sense) is RECON SIDE RATION. That sums up \u201cNot the main food allotment for one on an intel mission?\u201d Now you slice up the other two theme entries, and you should wind of with a set of the following:17A: RECONSIDERATION = RECON SIDE RATION [\u201cNot the main food allotment for one on an intel mission?\u201d]36A: TEMPERAMENTALLY = TEMPE RAMEN TALLY [\u201cNoodle count in one of Arizona\u2019s largest cities?\u201d]53A: NONCOMMUNICABLE = NONCOM MUNI CABLE [\u201cSarge\u2019s \u2018Sell my city bonds!\u2019 telegram?\u201d]As I would have expected from a Lewis-Chen puzzle, there is a lot of good stuff in the puzzle outside the theme. The constructors introduced eight entries today (including two of the theme entries) and, in non-debut news, I liked IDRIS Elba, MYST, LOOK IT UP, DAILY PLANET, SPRAY TAN, BLIND ALLEYS, SURE DO, WET MARTINIS (I like them any way I can get them), HONEYMOONED and ROSHAMBO.\u2022 10A: Remember: Abbreviated clue means an abbreviated entry, so \u201cCorp. recruiters\u2019 targets\u201d would be M.B.A.S.\u2022 15A: One of the founders of the NAACP was a suffragist and civil rights activist named Mary White Ovington. Ms. Ovington grew up in a family that supported women\u2019s rights and had been part of the antislavery movement. When I first solved this, I wished that the clue had credited one of the black founders, like W.E.B. DuBois, but Mr. DuBois has been used in clues a number of times. My best guess about this is that an attempt was made to come up with a fresh clue.\u202222A: I have this theory that for every moment in life there is an equivalent \u201cSeinfeld\u201d moment, so I truly wanted the answer to \u201cLike the cinnamon in babka\u201d this to be LESSER, as in \u201clesser babka\u201d:\u2022 2D: Hands up if you had RAH before OL\u00c9 for the \u201cTwo-syllable cheer.\u201d\u2022 24D: I loved this clue. \u201cDid a tour after joining up?\u201d sounds like someone enlisted in the military, but we\u2019ve been misdirected: you can also join up in wedded bliss and go on your honeymoon.\u2022 27D: More misdirection! \u201cBiblical mount\u201d suggests a mountain like Ararat, but today we\u2019re thinking about mounts that someone can ride, like a CAMEL.\u2022 56D: I stared at this one for a while before I understood why the answer to \u201cBe on the level?\u201d is LIE. I\u2019m thinking that if you\u2019re lying down (horizontal), you\u2019re basically level. What do you think?We each took a crack at finding 15-letter words that could be split into 5/5/5 or 4/5/6 or 4/4/7. After sifting through a bunch of junk, we settled on these three. Here are a few alternates that didn\u2019t quite make the cut:HYPER/CRITIC/ALLYINTER/MEDIA/TINGTOUGH/MINDED/NESSLIEU/TENANTS/HIPSAPP/RENT/ICES/HIPSSTAND/OF/FISH/NESSThe first version we submitted included the revealer THE SPLITS clued as [Show of flexibility ... and what 16\u2212, 25\u2212, and 40\u2212Across each do]. It was deemed to be not such a great addition to the main theme so we decided to rework the puzzle. With only three theme entries, we tried to construct a wide-open grid with as much fresh fill as possible. Hope you all enjoy the result.And, as many others have said, it\u2019s a great pleasure to work with Jeff!Both of us are recreational programmers (me much hackier than Parker, who actually works in the field). It occurred to me that his TEMPE/RAMEN/TALLY seed idea might be a fun project to expand my coding skills, and after a few attempts, I figured out a way to at least narrow down my list into a subset that might be reasonably human-scannable.Et voila, the other two popped out! (After about 10 hours of line-by-line searching.) HYPER CRITIC ALLY was also a possibility, but it wasn\u2019t nearly as nice, as it didn\u2019t change the \u201ccritic\u201d meaning at all.To the credit of Parker and his programming skills, he came up with these ... and a bunch of others (mentioned above). Shows you what I know.Nicely done, Mr. Lewis and Mr. Chen.Your thoughts?Join us as we crush the Thursday puzzle each week on The New York Times\u2019s Facebook page:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Broadway Bounty Hunter\u2019 Stars Annie Golden as Herself", "Date": "2016-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe show, featuring songs by Joe Iconis and a book by Mr. Iconis, Lance Rubin and Jason SweetTooth Williams, turns on a willfully silly conceit. An out-of-work actor \u2014 that\u2019s Annie as Annie \u2014 pursues a second career as a vigilante chasing down dangerous criminals. Powered by a silky retro-R&B score, the musical delights with its loopy idea for longer than you might expect, but as the plot sprouts more absurdities, it ultimately begins to feel like an overextended \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d sketch (albeit a good one).It\u2019s safe to assume that the wackier details do not correspond directly to Ms. Golden\u2019s experience, although the show makes specific references to her career before it spins off into freaky fantasyland. At an audition for a new jukebox musical, Annie (the character) meets a younger actor who notes that Annie has been in \u201cHair\u201d and \u201cAssassins\u201d and \u201cLeader of the Pack\u201d and \u201cThe Full Monty\u201d \u2014 as indeed Ms. Golden has.\u201cNice to know there are fans out there,\u201d Annie responds with a grateful smile.\u201cOh no, I\u2019m not a fan,\u201d comes the deflating reply. \u201cI just Googled you when I heard your name.\u201dIt\u2019s that kind of day for poor Annie, who\u2019s later rejected for a part \u2014 playing the mother! \u2014 by a director she once worked with, and told to come back to read for the role of the \u201ckooky maid.\u201d So it goes for a \u201cWoman of a Certain Age,\u201d as the engaging opening number reminds us. Annie\u2019s spirit begins to circle the drain as she trudges home, only to have the lights go out because she didn\u2019t pay her electric bill.In another appealing ballad, about days gone by, Annie sings, \u201cMy voice could kill in any key, never had to take the harmony.\u201d But those years are past, for the character at least. Metaphorically speaking, the chorus tells us \u201cthey don\u2019t spin those records anymore.\u201dWhat\u2019s an out-of-work actor to do? Beating up bad guys beats going back to waiting tables, right?So Annie embarks upon a rigorous training regimen and finds a professional (and maybe romantic) partner in the icy-cool Lazarus, played with slick magnetism by Alan H. Green. Their first mission is to head for South America to capture a big-time brothel owner and drug pusher, Mac Roundtree (a shout-out to Richard Roundtree, who played Shaft back in the day), portrayed as a wild-eyed predator by Jeff McCarthy.Although the scenes and songs that follow have their pleasures \u2014 Anastacia McCleskey slinks and sings seductively as the tough leader of Mac\u2019s prostitutes \u2014 the quirks of the plot gradually descend from zany to ludicrous. Mac\u2019s true identity, for instance, involves a preposterous coincidence.And the show\u2019s silliness might go down easier, and might even be moving, if the story were framed as the fantasy of an actor with an overactive imagination and no role to channel it into; instead we are essentially expected to take its outlandish events at face value.Mr. Iconis frames the similarities between Annie\u2019s dual careers with knowing precision in a song for Annie and Shiro Jin, as he attempts to persuade her to join his team: \u201cBounty hunting is one part animal instinct,\u201d he sings, \u201cone part primal rage, one part valiant courage and the wisdom that comes with age.\u201dThat\u2019s a useful skill set to drive an actor through the merciless grind of role-snaring, not to mention facing audiences eight times a week. Even if the job you are lucky enough to get is playing yourself.An earlier version of the cast box with this review misstated the closing date of \u201cBroadway Bounty Hunter.\u201d It is Sept. 4, not 24.Broadway Bounty HunterMusic and lyrics by Joe Iconis; book by Mr. Iconis, Lance Rubin and Jason SweetTooth Williams; directed by Julianne Boyd; choreography by Jeffrey Page; musical direction/vocal arrangements by Joel Waggoner; sets by Timothy Mackabee; costumes by Bobby Frederick Tilley; lighting by Eric Southern; sound by Josh Millican; production stage manager, E Sara Barnes; music supervisor/orchestrations by Charlie Rosen; fight choreography by Ryan Winkles; produced by Branden Huldeen; artistic producer, William Finn.

{"Headline": "The Activist and Herbalife: Just Maybe Ackman\u2019s Right", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "Supported byDealBookBill Ackman, the activist investor, has been painted as a loser in his yearslong quest to shut down Herbalife, the nutritional supplement company that he bet against, contending it defrauded customers and was a pyramid scheme.On Wall Street, Mr. Ackman\u2019s rivals snickered. The headlines have been withering: \u201cHerbalife Settles Pyramid Scheme Case With Regulator, in Blow to Pershing\u2019s Ackman,\u201d Reuters wrote. \u201cHerbalife Scores Huge Victory in Its Bill Ackman Battle With F.T.C. Settlement,\u201d Forbes said. And on and on.And yet there\u2019s something grossly wrong with this assessment.Yes, Mr. Ackman has lost a ton of money for his investors on his bet against Herbalife. But with the F.T.C. settlement, he has won a moral victory that could very well help hundreds of thousands of Herbalife\u2019s defrauded customers, who are mainly low-income immigrants who would most likely not have had any legal recourse had Mr. Ackman not loudly called the company into question.Herbalife, she said, was responsible for \u201cdeceiving hundreds of thousands of hopeful people.\u201d She described \u201cthe dream portrayed by Herbalife\u201d as an illusion. She went on to say that \u201cthe vast majority of Herbalife distributors found they could make little or no money selling Herbalife products.\u201dWorse still, Ms. Ramirez said, her agency had determined that \u201cpeople who leased space and opened a nutrition club and worked long hours made no money or lost money.\u201d And, she concluded: \u201cThe small minority of Herbalife distributors who did make a lot of money were paid by Herbalife not for selling the company\u2019s products, but for buying the products themselves and then successfully recruiting large networks of others to do the same.\u201dIn other words, she described pretty much exactly what Mr. Ackman has been saying for the last three years.According to Mr. Ackman in 2014, \u201cThese people work really hard, and unfortunately, they don\u2019t realize that they\u2019ve been defrauded.\u201dMr. Ackman specializes in making big, concentrated bets. Sometimes his investments score big, but that\u2019s not always the case. Here\u2019s how some of his ideas have fared.And here we are today, and they were true.\u201cIf it were not for Bill, I don\u2019t think the F.T.C. would have launched an investigation,\u201d Mr. Braun, the director, said. \u201cBill is unquestionably the catalyst.\u201dHerbalife refused to participate in the film, though Mr. Braun said he met and spoke privately with Herbalife\u2019s chief executive, Michael O. Johnson, for several hours.The website also noted that the producer of \u201cBetting on Zero\u201d and Bill Ackman were on the same crew team in college. According to Mr. Braun, one of the producers, Devin Adair, \u201coverlapped\u201d with Mr. Ackman at Harvard, but said that they were not friends and hadn\u2019t talked in decades. Ms. Adair was the coxswain for one of the crew boats; Mr. Ackman rowed on a different boat.The battle has been portrayed as either a pitched fight between a narcissistic, know-it-all investor seeking to bankrupt a company for profit (that\u2019s Herbalife\u2019s view) or as a crusading moralist trying to right a wrong. It may be a combination of both.\u201cThis is an \u2018Emperor Wears No Clothes\u2019 story,\u201d Mr. Braun said, explaining that the charm of that fairy tale \u201cis it\u2019s told by the sweet little boy.\u201d The message, he noted, is harder to accept when \u201cthe messenger is a tough hedge fund manager.\u201dAnd while there have long been moral questions about the very concept of \u201cshorting\u201d \u2014 betting against a company\u2019s stock \u2014 it is hard not to look at this particular situation as an example of an investor acting as a check on the market.Admittedly, there were questions about Mr. Ackman\u2019s tactics. He spent more than $50 million on his campaign, lobbying regulators and members of Congress to look into Herbalife\u2019s practices. But if Mr. Ackman didn\u2019t do it, who would? Complaints about Herbalife have been made for years, but it wasn\u2019t until Mr. Ackman very loudly got involved that the government stepped in.There are those who worry that Mr. Ackman\u2019s involvement in Herbalife means the oligarchs have taken over \u2014 that billionaires have become de facto regulators. It is a valid concern. And the billionaires may not always be on the right side. (Mr. Ackman has been involved in some investments, like Valeant Pharmaceuticals and J. C. Penney, that didn\u2019t go his way.)But, in this instance, he won a victory that will have real benefits for many people.And yet on Wall Street, his victory is considered hollow because he has so far lost money on his bet against Herbalife.\u201cTruth, candor and transparency are at odds with the measuring stick that Wall Street applies,\u201d Mr. Braun said.For now, Herbalife is heralding the settlement as a victory that will allow it to move on with its business. But Mr. Braun says that if the company genuinely changes its business model to conform with the settlement, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine a way for them to be profitable.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think this is over,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}

And who gets to write it?Your reviewer chose to dismiss or overlook important new revelations concerning the disappearance of Imam Musa Sadr, a towering figure in 20th-century Shiism; documents revealing the flow of weapons and cash from Arab leaders and terrorist groups to the Khomeini movement; the disclosure that United States diplomats were in close contact with Iranian opposition leaders; that senior Muslim clerics opposed Khomeini and begged the shah to end his rebellion; and that the shah repeatedly, and over the strong objections of his top army brass, refused to sanction the crackdown that might have saved his throne but led to bloodshed.The contributions of non-Iranian scholars to the debate on the Pahlavi era should not be dismissed out of hand. As outsiders, we bring to the discussion a different way of thinking and new tools in research and analysis. We can say things in public that many Iranian intellectuals will only admit to in private. During my trip to Iran to study Shiism as part of book research \u2014 a fact left out of Moaveni\u2019s review \u2014 I experienced firsthand just how popular the shah and his family are with many ordinary Iranians.This book will, I hope, shake up a historical narrative that for too long has felt too settled. \u201cBlunt histories do not always meet with warm approval,\u201d the historian Margaret MacMillan writes.

Nevertheless, Moaveni is too credulous of Cooper\u2019s allegations that President Jimmy Carter opposed and exaggerated the shah\u2019s human rights abuses.While Carter claimed that human rights would underscore his foreign policy, he effusively praised the shah. During a visit by the Iranian leader to the White House, Carter referred to the Iranian dictator\u2019s \u201cenlightened leadership\u201d and \u201creaffirmed to His Majesty that he fully supports the special relationship\u201d between the two nations \u2014 a relationship characterized in large part by the sale of weapons in one direction and oil in the other.Carter topped even these fulsome tributes a month later in Tehran, declaring, in a mind-numbing misreading of historical momentum: \u201cIran, because of the great leadership of the shah, is an island of stability in one of the more troubled areas of the world.\u201d As Iranian opposition to the shah mounted, the president saw only \u201cthe admiration and love which your people give to you,\u201d adding: \u201cThere is no leader with whom I have a deeper sense of personal gratitude and personal friendship.\u201dTo be sure, some Carter administration officials did take the president\u2019s human rights rhetoric seriously, criticizing the shah for widespread imprisonment and torture of opponents. But Carter for most of his presidency publicly backed this tyrant, ensuring that those who deposed him would direct their ire against the United States as well \u2014 helping to inaugurate 40 years of U.S.-\u00adIranian antagonism, which Presidents Obama and Rouhani have only recently begun to overcome.ROBERT SHAFFERSHIPPENSBURG, PA.The writer is a professor of history at Shippensburg University. \u2b25Is This the Place?To the Editor:If one types \u201cThis Must Be the Place\u201d in Google, information about the movie and the song are the first hits.

{"Headline": "Nina Stibbe\u2019s New Novel Sets a Moody Teenage Heroine in a Sketchy Nursing Home", "Date": "2016-08-08", "News": "Supported byFictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.The premise of Nina Stibbe\u2019s novel \u201cParadise Lodge\u201d is not the stuff of an HBO mini-series. Here\u2019s a summary in one sentence: A teenager gets a job at a local nursing home, and the quality of care declines for a while before improving. You still awake? Keep reading. Like a number of British things \u2014 toad-in-the-hole, spotted dick and Black Sabbath come to mind \u2014 the novel is much tastier than its description would lead you to believe.If Lizzie were an American teenager living in 2016, her motivating thrust might be the desire to secure admission at an Ivy League school or acquire an Apple Watch. But because it is 1977 and Lizzie lives in Leicestershire, her primary goal is to get and keep a job, for reasons both acquisitive (a desire to buy upmarket shampoo and pastel underwear printed with the days of the week) and poignant (a desire to be wanted and needed by other people). Her secondary goal is to avoid truant officers who might wrangle her back to school, thereby thwarting goal No. 1.Supervision is generally absent in Lizzie\u2019s life. Her family is \u2014 what\u2019s a good term here? I\u2019ll say \u201cchaotic.\u201d There\u2019s a stepfather, an indistinct number of siblings, and a mother whose past is spotted with drinking, drug use, random disappearances and a slide into poverty. When Lizzie spots a sign advertising jobs at the nursing home, she decides to apply. \u201cI was longing for something that might blossom into a new phase that didn\u2019t involve \u00adhorses, or school or becoming a punk,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI loved the idea of being professionally compassionate.\u201dThe home is Paradise Lodge, which is the sort of John Milton joke that could appear only in a British novel, and its operating status is best described, to use an American colloquialism, as \u201csketchy.\u201d An estate owner, strapped for cash, has converted his manor into a holding pen for the infirm elderly. Laundry goes unwashed, dentures are accidentally switched, and the on-site morgue is located directly beside the pantry. When the kitchen runs out of everything except tinned pie filling and instant custard, patients are served dessert instead of square meals. When they ask why, they are told \u201cthey\u2019d just had shepherd\u2019s pie and peas but must\u2019ve forgotten all about it.\u201d The owner walks around nude. Everyone is pretty happy.Lizzie completes her auxiliary-nurse duties with zeal, powdering patients with an antifungal agent and administering hot bedtime drinks through sippy cups. She cleans false teeth and wipes bottoms and mops up accidents. A patient bites her. All of these experiences are more appealing to her than attending school, which implies something troubling about the Leicestershire education system.Stibbe has a gift for summoning the high-octane low-attention-span pimple\u00adfest that is adolescence. Like all teen\u00adagers, Lizzie is part child, part adult and part monster; she cycles through moods as quickly as one cycles through socks. Her universe is vivid and studded with sociological details that may or may not signify class distinctions \u2014 this, alas, is a disadvantage that plagues foreign readers of British novels. What is a Goblin Teasmade, for example, and what kind of person owns one? What is leccy? What does \u201cgormless\u201d mean? What\u2019s Dream Topping? Most of these mysteries can be solved with context clues, and what can\u2019t be gleaned can be Googled. \u201cGranary bread,\u201d I learned, is a brownish loaf with more folic acid than white bread. \u201cBrewer\u2019s droop\u201d refers to erectile dysfunction. I look forward to incorporating the above into my everyday vocabulary.In \u201cParadise Lodge,\u201d as in life, there\u2019s not much plot, but there are incidents galore. There is also a great deal of death, which you may find odd based on the merry tone of this review. But it is, in fact, a merry book. Death comes to Lizzie\u2019s workplace the way an expired yogurt might come to one of your co-workers on a Tuesday morning. It happens; it is dealt with; the day moves on, and perhaps a joke is cracked. Our young heroine sees the world through glasses tinted not rose, exactly, but at least salmon or mauve.Molly Young is a contributing writer at The New York Times Magazine. Advertisement"}

Yes, one gets you drunk, and the other wakes you up. But they also linger in different ways.The Princeton scientists performed a series of experiments, revealing that the key difference between whisky and coffee is that whisky is a mix of two liquids \u2014 alcohol and water \u2014 while coffee is just water, with brown bits mixed in. As the alcohol in whisky evaporates, the concentration of water increases, and that creates flows that generate the patterns.Other molecules in whisky also prove important: a surfactant, a chemical that reduces the surface tension of the droplets, and long, stringlike molecules known as polymers, which attach to the glass, providing a template.The mystery has not been completely solved. The scientists have not identified the particular surfactant and polymers in whisky or where they come from. \u201cFor now, we are not sure,\u201d Dr. Kim said. \u201cTo prove that kind of detail, we need to do a careful chemical study.\u201dA likely source for the surfactants and polymers are the wood barrels used to age whisky. Mr. Button has found that most spirits not aged in wood, like vodka, do not create patterns like those left by whisky.That supposition is supported by experimentation that took place last month. Mr. Button tracked down a bottle of Oak by Absolut, a vodka steeped in wood chips. Whiskylike patterns appeared.\u201cBut it\u2019s not as strong,\u201d Mr. Button said of the patterns, \u201cbecause it\u2019s only resting in the wood a short amount of time.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He got to know Mr. Brin and Mr. Page through a longtime friend, Anne Wojcicki, a founder of the genetics company 23andMe who was married to Mr. Brin.When Mr. Maris founded GV in 2009, some Silicon Valley investors were skeptical that a venture arm of a large corporation could become a major player in start-up investing. Corporate venture capital firms have traditionally had a spotty record of success.Mr. Maris has described how he pushed executives at Google to let him run GV as a traditional venture firm, with little input from corporate executives, so that it could compete with independent venture firms such as Benchmark and Sequoia Capital.In addition to Mr. Krane, GV has a dozen investment professionals and dozens of employees who advise start-ups on engineering, design, marketing and recruiting.

Instead, most of its weight is supported on three buoyant concrete boxes, called caissons, anchored permanently below the water line.A visit to the middle caisson this summer opened my eyes to a world I could not have imagined out in the Hudson River. Though the caissons are submerged, they can be reached by stairs down shaftways through the pier shed deck.Squared-off columns and massive beams form an underwater hypostyle hall that is at once claustrophobic \u2014 dank, close and cool \u2014 and yet seemingly limitless. Space stretches away from the puny pool of a smartphone flashlight into echoing, fathomless darkness.When the caissons were finished, water was piped back into the basin and the caissons floated upward.How?Water has a density of 1 gram per cubic centimeter, or 62 pounds per cubic foot. Solid concrete would sink but the caissons are hollow boxes.

{"Headline": "How Producing Clean Power Turned Out to Be a Messy Business", "Date": "2016-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn the edge of a bucolic field in Princeton, N.J., an eco-friendly office building recently opened its doors. Plants festoon the roof, a living wall is planned for the lobby, and rainwater storage tanks supply the building\u2019s needs. In the parking lot there are wind turbines, solar panels and electric vehicle charging stations.It is the picture of a sustainable future, one in which society\u2019s insatiable demand for electricity can be met without polluting the planet.The same cannot be said of the building\u2019s tenant, NRG Energy.The biggest independent power producer in the country, NRG sells electricity to utilities, companies and individual homes. To generate all that wattage, it burns enormous amounts of natural gas, coal and oil, making NRG one of the country\u2019s biggest polluters.It isn\u2019t trying to muck up the planet; that\u2019s just the nature of the business NRG is in. The electricity industry is the biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. In 2014, NRG was the fourth-largest emitter of carbon dioxide among the country\u2019s power producers.The business of providing Americans with electricity hasn\u2019t evolved much in a century. But today, growing concerns about climate change, affordable wind and solar power, and the potential for distributed generation are pressuring utilities and power producers like NRG to clean up their acts, and fast.\u201cOur industry is going though massive transformation, the likes of which we\u2019ve never seen,\u201d said Mauricio Gutierrez, the recently installed chief executive of NRG. \u201cThe industry has never seen this much turnover.\u201dAll this transformation has been particularly tumultuous for NRG, which has weathered more than its share of mishaps and unintended consequences: In May, for example, a fire knocked out a crucial tower at a cutting-edge but troubled solar power plant that the company manages in the Southern California desert. Its big bets on residential solar and on a national charging network for electric vehicles were ahead of their time and fizzled.The shale and fracking booms in the United States made natural gas cheap and abundant, pulling down the price of electricity and making power sources that NRG still depends on heavily \u2014 including coal, nuclear and renewables \u2014 less profitable. Investors lost faith in the company, NRG\u2019s stock plummeted, and its previous chief executive was summarily fired, replaced by Mr. Gutierrez.Far from emerging as an industry pioneer, NRG has become a cautionary tale. A power-hungry nation needs to change the way it is fueled, but as NRG shows, transitioning to clean power is messy business.\u201cThe power producers and utilities are the canaries in the coal mine,\u201d said Aron Cramer, C.E.O. of Business for Social Responsibility, a consulting firm. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a lot of road kill in the midst of this transition to a lower-carbon energy system.\u201dNo two companies face the exact same set of challenges. But at some level, the quandary preoccupying NRG is one that all power producers and utilities will ultimately face: how to make more electricity while emitting fewer greenhouse gases.NRG wasn\u2019t always a clean-energy proponent. Until recently, it was just another power producer, burning fossil fuels to electrify the grid.In 2003, it tapped David Crane to be its chief executive. Mr. Crane, who previously ran a traditional London-based power company, set about expanding NRG\u2019s core business. He acquired Reliant Energy, which sells electricity to homes and businesses in Texas, as well as GenOn Energy, a rival based in Houston. These moves vastly expanded NRG\u2019s scale, and its emissions.By 2006, Mr. Crane began to respond to the climate crisis and became one of the country\u2019s most unlikely environmentalists.At first, he made modest changes. NRG bought a wind power company, which it later sold. Soon, though, Mr. Crane made large investments in wind and solar plants and spent heavily on pet projects like a national network of electric-car charging stations.Seemingly overnight, the fossil fuels executive became a champion of renewable energy. He wanted to turn the hub-and-spoke utility model \u2014 with big power plants sending electricity out to homes and businesses \u2014 inside out.\u201cIt\u2019s the destiny of NRG to be a leader,\u201d Mr. Crane said at the groundbreaking of the new headquarters, \u201cto create a more sustainable and prosperous future while winning the fight against climate change.\u201dMr. Crane was channeling the spirit of the time. In December, world leaders in Paris pledged to combat climate change. The United States said it would cut its greenhouse gas emissions by more than a quarter in 10 years. With wind and solar power cheaper than ever and consumers starting to embrace energy-saving technologies, these targets could be within reach.But the climate crisis won\u2019t be solved with more Teslas alone. If the goals set in Paris are to be met, big electricity producers like NRG will need to reduce emissions while increasing power production. So Mr. Crane set about trying to retool NRG\u2019s fleet of dirty power plants while building a new generation of utility-scale wind and solar projects.NRG\u2019s dual personality \u2014 fossil fuel giant and clean energy pioneer \u2014 is on display at two relatively new facilities on opposite ends of the country.Just south of Los Angeles International Airport, four smokestacks punctuate the sandy coastline. There in one form or another since the 1950s, they are part of the El Segundo Energy Center, which produces enough electricity to power nearly 450,000 homes.At first glance, it is just another power plant burning cheap and abundant natural gas. Yet the El Segundo plant is among the most sophisticated of its kind. The two operational units, which came online in 2013, replaced inefficient relics constructed a half-century ago. Wastewater is recycled, emissions controls minimize the production of nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide, and a mix of combustion and steam turbines greatly enhance the amount of energy derived from the gas.And perhaps most critically, the El Segundo Energy Center is only occasionally generating power.A generation ago, it operated almost constantly, feeding the vast energy needs of Los Angeles. But over the last several years, big power companies \u2014 including NRG \u2014 have constructed enormous solar power plants in Southern California, supplying a growing share of daytime electricity.When the sun is shining, NRG\u2019s new high-tech gas-fired power plant is often dormant, coming alive only when demand ramps up and the sun has dimmed. In that sense, the El Segundo plant is a big leap forward. Yet the very need to pour millions of dollars into retrofitting this gas-fired plant on the picturesque shore of the Pacific Ocean shows just how much work has yet to be done.Across the country, in Spencer, Mass., NRG is putting the final touches on a community solar project on the grounds of St. Joseph\u2019s Abbey, a Trappist monastery. There, on rolling green hills near the monks\u2019 quarters, hundreds of hard-hatted workers are busy erecting thousands of solar panels.The electricity generated from those panels will flow through new transmission lines, which were required because the existing grid infrastructure could not handle the influx of solar energy. The project will power about 2,000 nearby homes, which should have lower and more reliable electricity bills.By NRG\u2019s standards, the solar plant is relatively small, but more are in the works. With enough such plants on the grid, they could help NRG achieve its ambitious emissions reductions targets.This is exactly the kind of change that Mr. Crane championed. And yet he is no longer the chief executive of NRG. He was abruptly fired in December, after NRG stock plummeted 63 percent in a year.Earnings fell as cheap natural gas made NRG\u2019s coal-fired plants less competitive, and investors had grown weary of Mr. Crane\u2019s focus on clean energy. Even as NRG\u2019s core business was losing money, Mr. Crane devoted much of his quarterly earnings calls to discussions about clean-power projects.\u201cWe all believe in renewables,\u201d said Shahriar Pourreza, an analyst with Guggenheim Partners. \u201cBut there was such a change in the message of the company that investors lost confidence in the management team.\u201dThe NRG board named the company\u2019s chief operating officer, Mr. Gutierrez, as the new leader. He had grown up in Mexico City, where electricity was sometimes spotty. Mr. Gutierrez joined his family\u2019s engineering company, then worked for Dynegy, a power producer in Houston, before joining NRG. Yet he says that like his predecessor, he is committed to environmental stewardship.\u201cWhen a spiritual leader like the pope calls out our moral responsibility toward the environment, it\u2019s a pretty big thing,\u201d Mr. Gutierrez said. \u201cIt transcends science and policy.\u201dHe was engaged in efforts to combat climate change well before Paris. As Mr. Crane\u2019s C.O.O., he led an NRG task force that recommended that the company adopt ambitious targets for emissions reduction. Mr. Gutierrez recently recommitted to those goals. \u201cRenewables is something that\u2019s very important for our portfolio,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s good business.\u201dMr. Gutierrez has a tricky balancing act. He must appease demanding investors and a skittish board, which most likely means reining in some of Mr. Crane\u2019s clean-energy ventures. Yet he must also fill the shoes of a chief executive who had raised hopes among environmentalists that a big energy producer was getting serious about climate change. He must profitably manage gas and coal assets \u2014 which still make up most of the company\u2019s power generation, sales and profits \u2014 while also preparing for a future that is more dependent on solar and wind.Analysts are pleased with Mr. Gutierrez\u2019s performance so far. He has simplified the corporate structure, played down some of Mr. Crane\u2019s side projects and focused on the balance sheet. NRG shares have risen 40 percent since Mr. Gutierrez took over.\u201cWith the old management, there was such a change in message, the company started to lose credibility,\u201d Mr. Pourreza said. \u201cMauricio is leading this company in the right direction.\u201dBut how NRG will actually achieve vast reductions in its carbon footprint is unclear. As long as it is burning so much gas and coal, it will remain a major emitter of greenhouse gases. And while Mr. Gutierrez speaks hopefully of developments in carbon-capture technology and utility-scale battery storage, practical solutions remain elusive. \u201cDo we have a perfect line of sight on how we\u2019re going to get there? No,\u201d he said. \u201cDo we have a road map? Yes.\u201dComplicating matters, the Obama administration\u2019s signature effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector \u2014 the Clean Power Plan \u2014 is tied up in the courts. (NRG was among the companies that petitioned the E.P.A. to modify the plan, arguing that it made the power sector too reliant on natural gas.) The ambiguous fate of that plan has added regulatory uncertainty to an industry already in flux.\u201cYou have these goals set in Paris, you have a framework for getting there through the Clean Power Plan, and you have the judicial branch saying stop,\u201d said Ralph Izzo, chief executive of Public Service Enterprise Group, a New Jersey utility. \u201cYou can\u2019t make economic decisions in that environment.\u201dEven NRG\u2019s big renewable projects \u2014 installations that are supposed to one day replace coal- and gas-fired plants \u2014 are mired in problems. In the Southern California desert, NRG oversees operations at Ivanpah, the world\u2019s largest solar thermal installation, where thousands of mirrors reflect the sun at enormous towers and water is converted to steam that powers turbines. NRG owns the plant along with BrightSource Energy and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.Heralded as a beacon of clean energy when it opened in 2014, Ivanpah has been continually troubled.From the outset, it produced less electricity than expected. Over the last few years, the cost of solar panels fell sharply, making Ivanpah\u2019s power comparatively expensive. In March, the consortium that owns the plant nearly defaulted on a contract with Pacific Gas & Electric, the Northern California utility.Then in May, a fire at the plant knocked out one of the towers, raising new questions about the project\u2019s viability. Last week, when NRG reported quarterly earnings, it said that revenue from its renewables businesses was down 14 percent to $57 million, largely the result of problems at Ivanpah.This isn\u2019t the first time that a big energy company has made ambitious plans to become a leader in green energy, only to be reined in. In 2000, BP introduced its \u201cBeyond Petroleum\u201d tagline and began investing heavily in renewable energy. It committed billions of dollars to wind and solar projects, and made investments in carbon capture and biofuels.After a decade of investment, BP largely backed off its renewables program. Most of its money was still coming from oil and gas, and the company set about selling its solar and wind power assets. They simply weren\u2019t profitable enough.\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to recall that 10 years ago BP was one of the darlings of the green movement,\u201d said Justin Adams, managing director of global lands for the Nature Conservancy and a former executive at BP working on renewables.\u201cThrough that period, some investors were interested, most were ambivalent at best and some downright skeptical at worst,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat on earth was BP doing, taking its eyes off its core business and tinkering around with renewables?\u201dAt NRG, Mr. Gutierrez has already backed away from residential solar and electric-vehicle charging projects that Mr. Crane held so dear. So far, however, there are no signs that NRG will completely reverse course. Mr. Gutierrez is still pushing community solar power, and NRG provides solar installations to big companies like Whole Foods. Last week, NRG spent nearly $200 million to acquire more solar and wind assets.Today, NRG generates about 9 percent of its electricity from renewable assets, up from less than 1 percent in 2008, and that figure is likely to grow. Across the industry, a majority of power plants being built today use renewables, not fossil fuels.\u201cThe sad moral of this story is that it\u2019s very hard to be a C.E.O. for tomorrow, when the markets only care about being a C.E.O. for today,\u201d said Mr. Cramer of Business for Social Responsibility. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone really questions his vision, but he wasn\u2019t given any opportunity to put it into action.\u201dMr. Gutierrez says he shares his predecessor\u2019s vision. By 2050, he envisions enormous batteries storing solar power generated during the day, allowing people to use it at night. Distributed energy will be more common, as Mr. Crane predicted. Carbon-capture technology will make the burning of fossil fuels much less environmentally destructive, Mr. Gutierrez hopes. Perhaps coal-fired power plants will be gone altogether.\u201cWe are a part of the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are also a big part of the solution.\u201dIt\u2019s an appealing vision of a green energy system, one that could fulfill the needs of an electricity-hungry world without spoiling the environment. But how NRG gets there \u2014 especially with investors and a board that seem intolerant of bold steps \u2014 remains vague at best. For now, Mr. Gutierrez is caught in the middle: hoping to arrive at a cleaner future while still satisfying today\u2019s investors, rolling out fields of solar while also burning tons of gas and coal.\u201cLet\u2019s all acknowledge that we can\u2019t change our energy system overnight,\u201d Mr. Cramer said. \u201cBut how do we start making meaningful progress? Saying 90 percent by 2050 is the easy part. We need to start making progress now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Even with an architecture degree from the University of California, Berkeley, he found himself laid off and out of luck. Rather than look for another job in the fields of housing or public policy, where he had planned a career, he decided to take a risk.\u201cActing was always in the back of my head,\u201d Mr. Abdul-Mateen said.So he left the Bay Area for Los Angeles with the notion that if he could somehow get cast in a McDonald\u2019s commercial, he might end up with a bit part in a soap opera, which could lead to a role on a bigger network show. \u201cI made a plan: If I hadn\u2019t done anything in three years, I was going to say, \u2018O.K., back to a job in an architecture firm or public policy,\u2019\u201d he said.In Los Angeles, he auditioned for an educational theater group, only to be told he was too old. But the instructor\u2019s husband was casting a small production of \u201cTwelfth Night,\u201d and soon Mr. Abdul-Mateen found himself playing Antonio.\u201cSomeone in the cast was applying to graduate drama school, and I said, \u2018You can do that?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI Googled the top programs in the country. I prepped for about seven months, doing auditions in my living room, talking to the wall.\u201dTo prepare for his role, Mr. Abdul-Mateen worked on his moves four to seven hours a day. \u201cBefore this, I was not a dancer,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew when the music comes on, you move to it. I\u2019m from New Orleans, so I like second line. But I thought I was more coordinated than I turned out to be.\u201dAfter spending his early childhood in the Magnolia housing projects, he moved to Oakland. \u201cBut New Orleans is one of those places that doesn\u2019t leave the house,\u201d he said.A sense of authenticity will be crucial to the show\u2019s success. Those familiar with its setting are likely to watch closely, given that its Australian creator\u2019s background is so different from those of the characters on screen. Mr. Luhrmann brought aboard Grandmaster Flash and Kurtis Blow to school the cast members and keep the look and atmosphere correct.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t claim to be an expert,\u201d Mr. Abdul-Mateen said of Mr. Luhrmann.The actor has come to appreciate his character\u2019s vintage style. \u201cYou notice how much self-expression is really embedded in the fashion,\u201d he said. \u201cMen wearing their shirts down with their chests open. You got black people wearing huge Afros, wearing gold, walking tall and strutting and saying, \u2018How you doing, Brother?\u2019 It was a time to be proud of who you were.\u201dA typical workday in the dance studio began with hamstring stretches, many of them the same as the ones Mr. Abdul-Mateen did when he ran track at Berkeley. The key for era-appropriate dancing, he learned, is the hips.\u201cVery important,\u201d he said. \u201cMen in the \u201970s communicated with their hips much more than they do now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Delphi and Mobileye to Produce System for Self-Driving Cars", "Date": "2016-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe race to build self-driving cars is becoming an increasingly crowded field.And then there are suppliers, like Delphi Automotive and Mobileye, that intend to develop turnkey self-driving systems that automakers could build into their vehicles.Delphi, formed out of the former parts division of General Motors, and Mobileye, a rising Israeli company known for producing the sensors and other technology that help cars recognize obstacles in the road, said on Tuesday that they had formed a partnership to provide self-driving components to automakers by the end of 2019.Mobileye and Delphi said they expected to demonstrate an early version of their system in January at the 2017 International CES, the annual consumer electronics show, in Las Vegas and to begin production of a commercial version within two years.Mobileye is already a vendor of computer-vision technology and other related systems to carmakers. For Delphi, the partnership is an extension of its other efforts to develop self-driving cars, including a project with the government of Singapore to field a test fleet of driverless taxis. In 2015, a driverless car built by Delphi completed a 3,400-mile trip from San Francisco to New York in nine days.The Mobileye-Delphi collaboration \u201cwill accelerate the time to market\u201d and enable carmakers to produce vehicles capable of driving themselves \u201cwithout the need for huge capital investments,\u201d Amnon Shashua, chairman and chief technology officer of Mobileye, said on Tuesday in a conference call with reporters.Delphi\u2019s chief executive, Kevin Clark, added, \u201cWe believe this reshapes the automated driving landscape.\u201dNot so long ago, it seemed that Google and, separately, the electric carmaker Tesla Motors had clear leads over the traditional auto industry in developing technology for autonomous vehicles.Google has been testing its self-driving cars for a few years. Tesla grabbed the spotlight for a time after introducing its Autopilot feature last fall, although a fatal accident in May of a driver using the system has made clear that Autopilot is still far from being a self-driving car technology.But efforts to create self-driving cars are evolving so rapidly that traditional carmakers see an opening.Ford said last week that it would have a fully autonomous vehicle \u2014 with no steering wheels or pedals \u2014 operating in a ride-hailing service like Uber within five years. It expects to have 30 self-driving test cars on public roads by the end of this year and up to 90 by the end of 2017.The conventional car companies, with millions of vehicles already on the road, are trying to create a transition from driver-assistance and collision-avoidance systems already in their most advanced vehicles to a future of fully self-driving vehicles.BMW in July said it was partnering with Mobileye and Intel, the chip maker, in plans to offer a self-driving model by 2021.G.M. and Audi expect to offer enhanced cruise control and collision-avoidance systems in some 2018 models that they say will be the equals of, or more capable than, Tesla\u2019s Autopilot.Tesla\u2019s position is also uncertain because of the fatal crash in which Autopilot failed to recognize a truck crossing a road. Since news of that crash emerged, the company has emphasized that Autopilot is not intended to be a fully autonomous system and that drivers must keep their hands on the steering wheel and eyes on the road while using it, although YouTube videos show that some drivers do not follow the company\u2019s instructions.Autopilot uses Mobileye\u2019s sensor and processing technology. But the companies have recently parted ways. In a conference call, Mr. Shashua said Mobileye was unhappy with the way Tesla was using its technology.Not all carmakers predict that self-driving cars will proliferate rapidly. Honda Motor argues that more advanced technology is needed beyond the cameras and radar systems that are in use for the current driver-assist and collision-prevention systems, said Jim Keller, chief engineer at Honda\u2019s research center in Southfield, Mich.\u201cSensing technology is getting better and better, but it\u2019s not perfect,\u201d he said. Honda also says it believes cars need vehicle-to-vehicle, or V2V, communication devices that allow them to transmit their position and speed to other vehicles.\u201cRadar or a camera can only see what it can see,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what\u2019s around the corner or behind a building? You need V2V for that.\u201dDelphi, in the partnership with Mobileye, plans to provide automated driving software it has developed, as well as technology that uses cameras, radar and lidar, a type of radar based on laser beams. Delphi\u2019s current radar and sensing technology is used by many automakers for collision-avoidance, lane keeping, cruise control and automatic braking systems.The system the partners produce is intended to go first into automobiles that have steering wheels and gas and brake pedals, and it will be meant to assist, rather than replace, drivers.But the aim is to adapt those systems for fully self-driving cars.Mr. Shashua said the companies were relying on advances in sensing and \u201ca new class of machine intelligence\u201d to be successful. Fully autonomous vehicles \u201cneed sensing capable of recognizing moving objects and merging into traffic in a way that mimics human behavior,\u201d he said.Mr. Clark, the Delphi chief, said the companies would spend \u201chundreds of millions of dollars\u201d on the partnership without giving a more precise estimate.Mr. Shashua added that Mobileye\u2019s work with Delphi would complement the collaboration his company announced this summer with BMW and Intel.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why It\u2019s Not Enough Just to Be Disruptive", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother ViewThe unanimous takeaway has been that incumbents everywhere are poised to get their clocks cleaned by a stampede of disruptive insurgents \u2014 unless they buy them first.This analysis, however, misdiagnoses recent transactions as a series of new-versus-old shootouts.To be sure, the web has been grinding down barriers to entry for 20 years, reducing the advantages of incumbents. For new entrants, this flatter playing field creates opportunity. But since the key tools at their disposal are universally available \u2014 including to companies like Facebook and Google, with enormous scale advantages \u2014 this only helps them get into the game, not capture any value lost by legacy firms. Short-term success may be driven by exceptional execution; long-term value creation requires building a defensible model.Any microeconomics textbook will tell you there are limited sources of competitive advantage. The most valuable companies combine several reinforcing strands, like scale and customer loyalty. Gillette has long been, literally, a textbook example.In 1996, Warren E. Buffett, then the largest shareholder in Gillette, commented: \u201cYou go to bed feeling very comfortable just thinking about two and a half billion males with hair growing while you sleep. No one at Gillette has trouble sleeping.\u201dBut 20 years later, management at Gillette (long since acquired by Procter & Gamble) is probably tossing and turning a little more. Gillette\u2019s scale still provides formidable advantages (wide retail distribution, superior patented technology through large R.&D. investment), and its well-known brand (reinforced through mass-media advertising) creates a strong habit in loyal customers acquired early in their lives.However, those advantages are plainly no longer as formidable as they were at the company\u2019s zenith. For an insurgent like Dollar Shave Club, online sales reduce the impact of Gillette\u2019s big lead in drugstore shelf space, and cloud-computing services reduce the required upfront technology investment. Targeted direct marketing on Facebook and other social channels obviates the need for a mass-media campaign, while customer reviews and word-of-mouth can spread the word. At the high end, Gillette\u2019s patented, multi-blade, vibrating razor is a tough opponent, so naturally new entrants focus on the entry level \u2014 where they can rebrand cheap, no-name blades to compete.In Jet\u2019s case, the serial entrepreneur Marc Lore was able to build a large e-commerce company for a few hundred million dollars in just a couple of years by taking an innovative approach to pricing and distribution. And Walmart is plainly convinced that Jet\u2019s expertise and momentum will help it compete with Amazon. Jet\u2019s negative gross margins, which would have required large continuing investments, will disappear when combined with Walmart\u2019s purchasing and distribution scale.While it is hard to stay ahead solely through superior execution over an extended period, it is sometimes enough in the short term to draw a deep-pocketed buyer where there are strong, immediate synergies. Creating enormous value over the long term requires turning a tactical edge into some form of durable advantage.While there are plenty of extraordinary start-ups creating new markets with a path to genuine advantage, self-described \u201cdisrupters\u201d often find that the same forces that allowed them to get going initially also let in a horde of rivals. Competition drains away profit.This is particularly likely where the \u201cdisruptive innovation\u201d does not greatly change the cost structure or end-user experience. Putting a thin layer of software on a people-intensive service business, for instance, may win some immediate sales against Luddite competitors, but it is not necessarily sustainable, nor will it conjure up fat margins. New and existing competitors can often spiff up their supporting tech, too.As the Columbia Business School Professor Bruce C. Greenwald pointed out in his book \u201cCompetition Demystified,\u201d product differentiation on its own is not the basis for sustainable advantage. In his renowned example, \u201calmost everybody makes toasters\u201d \u2014 and if consumers one day demanded \u201ctoasters that sing when the bread is ready\u201d \u2014 soon every manufacturer would offer a \u201ccrooning toaster.\u201dThe rise of web-fueled competition is plainly inexorable. Computers are infinitely patient and accurate in comparing prices and opportunities, and now companies can provide a complete set of services to atomize the fixed costs formerly required for market entry.However, despite the threat to profits, there is no cause for gloom. Superior tactical execution can still create real value, particularly where it provides ammunition for a bigger war (like Walmart\u2019s battle with Amazon). And in the long term, value is created not by disruption, but by weaving together advantages (as both Amazon and Walmart have done in different ways) that together create a barrier that is hard to storm.Jeremy G. Philips is a general partner at Spark Capital and an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Was Shostakovich a Martyr? Or Is That Just Fiction?", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "Supported byNovelists have every right to use historical data to lend their works verisimilitude, and they are free to go beyond the facts, wherever their fancy leads them. Historians, though, are bound by circumstances, condemned to whatever partial, obstructed view their sources grant them. Their only recourse is to keep on looking and pray. Meanwhile, novelists can soar and gain an untrammeled vista.This book, I think, is a beautifully written botch, and it has me wondering anew about truth. People have been doing that, of course, for a long time \u2014 at least since Pilate confronted Christ. And the wrangling over what the truth might be about Shostakovich and his experiences under Stalin has been going on, it sometimes seems, almost as long.The fallacy of such thinking is to regard that essential truth as something revealed rather than created. Tolstoy did not make that mistake. He knew that the difference between real and fictional worlds is that a fictional world is wholly known. Nothing could remain hidden from Tolstoy about his imaginary Napoleonic Russia and its Natashas, Pierres and Andreis. But no matter how diligently he or we may burrow in the archives, there will always be more documents somewhere; some may contradict the ones we know, and there is no end to what was never recorded to begin with.So why, then, is Shostakovich given his own name in \u201cThe Noise of Time\u201d (as are all the other characters)? If Mr. Barnes had called his hero, say, Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov and let the reader divine the resemblance to Shostakovich, I would accept his work without demur. But Mr. Barnes evidently wanted to capitalize on the interest that frenzied debate has drummed up in his subject and to claim implicitly to have settled the issues concerning the composer\u2019s relationship with Soviet power, which scholars continue to dispute. In an author\u2019s note appended to the novel, he advertises his fidelity to his sources and his superior insights. He is trying to have it both ways: He wants the novelist\u2019s freedom and also the historian\u2019s authority. But in trying for both, he achieves neither.Mr. Barnes\u2019s view of Shostakovich conforms in every detail to the sentimental Cold War fable of a passive, pathetic yet saintly figure buffeted by an obtuse, implacable force. This stereotype goes beyond Shostakovich and beyond his music, all the way to music itself, imagined as pure and spotless, utterly truthful the way mathematics is truthful, unresistant to martyrdom and co-option but ultimately triumphant. These are the na\u00efve assumptions of pop Romanticism.The sources on which Mr. Barnes most conspicuously relies are the two canonical texts of the Shostakovich wars. One is \u201cTestimony,\u201d a best-seller that appeared in 1979 whose subtitle is \u201cThe Memoirs of Dmitri Shostakovich as Related to and Edited by Solomon Volkov\u201d; the other is the invaluable \u201cShostakovich: A Life Remembered\u201d (1994) by Elizabeth Wilson, a compendium of third-person accounts by people who knew the composer. Mr. Volkov\u2019s book (despite the seductive, still widely believed stories it promulgates) has been exposed as a mixture of recycled material that Shostakovich had approved for republication and fabrications that were inserted after his death. The other makes no truth claims but presents a great gabble of conflicting viewpoints from which we are invited to draw our own conclusions.Mr. Barnes has done just that. But the remarkable, disappointing fact is that his fictional Shostakovich is not his own invention. He has adopted a ready-made: the sinless version of Shostakovich peddled by \u201cTestimony,\u201d supplemented by the most lurid tales from Ms. Wilson\u2019s argosy and a published letter or two. The resulting narrative predictably recycles three mangy tales from the Shostakovich wars.The first concerns the anonymous Pravda editorial of Jan. 28, 1936, \u201cMuddle Instead of Music,\u201d which denounced Shostakovich\u2019s wildly successful opera \u201cThe Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District.\u201d It not only led to a ban on the opera but also, according to legend, put the composer under a cloud of suspicion that brought him within a hair\u2019s breadth of being \u201crepressed,\u201d as the saying went, in the Stalinist purges of 1936-38.The second recycled tale relates to the Cultural and Scientific Conference for World Peace, held in March 1949 at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York, where Shostakovich, fresh from a second denunciation at the hands of Andrei Zhdanov, Stalin\u2019s culture czar, was supposedly sent against his will as part of the Soviet delegation, only to be humiliated again in a confrontation with the composer Nicolas Nabokov.A decade later, as the third saga would have it, Nikita Khrushchev had Shostakovich browbeaten into joining the Soviet Communist Party so that he could serve as titular head of the Russian Federation\u2019s Union of Soviet Composers, after which the composer was supposedly so demoralized and filled with shame that he wrote a string quartet about it: his Eighth, often regarded as his masterpiece. All of its themes are derived from Shostakovich\u2019s initials, bearing witness to his own standing among the 20th century\u2019s \u201cvictims of war and fascism,\u201d in the words of the quartet\u2019s dedication.These three tales \u2014 the three books, so to speak, of the Shostakovich Apocrypha \u2014 correspond exactly to the three chapters of \u201cThe Noise of Time,\u201d and there is nothing in Mr. Barnes\u2019s account that cannot be found in the dubious sources he cites. His open fictionalization achieves nothing beyond what previous covert fictionalizations, like Mr. Volkov\u2019s, did.To see Shostakovich as a passive pawn in Stalin\u2019s clutches at the Waldorf does scant justice to a man whose collisions with power had taught him to play a complicated game with exceeding, self-concealing skill. In his one well-documented person-to-person encounter with Stalin, the phone call through which the dictator sought to coerce the composer\u2019s presence in New York, Shostakovich leveraged the world fame that made him indispensable to secure a lifting of the ban on his own and his colleagues\u2019 works that followed the \u201cformalist\u201d denunciations the previous year.After his return from abroad, Shostakovich paid the powers back with a pair of often derided tribute works, an oratorio called \u201cSong of the Forests\u201d and the soundtrack score for the film \u201cThe Fall of Berlin.\u201d As the British musicologist Pauline Fairclough has shown in a patient analysis, they are no worse than the works of Shostakovich we now treat with respect. The Shostakovich of history did not write badly for them and well for himself. No one writes badly on purpose, nor could anyone make a career as successful as the one Shostakovich made in Soviet Russia while maintaining the kind of moral and aesthetic purity his mythologizers attribute to him. No one makes a successful career anywhere without learning and executing an intricate social dance.As for his official co-option, there is no reason to think that Shostakovich sought either the Party membership or the Union leadership that the government thrust upon him. But once in possession of political power, Shostakovich behaved not like a saint but like a politician. As his recently published official correspondence shows, he was not above settling scores.In 1948, one of the worst things anyone said about him at the hearings that preceded the Central Committee\u2019s \u201cResolution on Music\u201d came from Vladimir Zakharov, the director of the Pyatnitsky Choir, the Soviet Union\u2019s leading song-and-dance ensemble. \u201cFrom the point of view of the People,\u201d Zakharov taunted, Shostakovich\u2019s Eighth Symphony \u201cis not a musical work at all; it is a \u2018composition\u2019 which has nothing whatever to do with the art of music.\u201dAt the very first Union meeting over which he presided as chair, Shostakovich paid back his tormentor (posthumously) with a scorching attack on the choir\u2019s repertory, which still consisted mainly of Zakharov arrangements. To one of the ensemble\u2019s then-active arrangers he wrote that the hapless fellow\u2019s setting of one particularly famous song \u201chas nothing in common with the art of music,\u201d echoing nearly verbatim Zakharov\u2019s old insult. Yes, his hands, too, were dirty. Everyone\u2019s were.The author of \u201cThe Porcupine\u201d knew that. What lured Mr. Barnes into hagiography when Shostakovich became his subject? Were I a novelist, I would speculate.Richard Taruskin is professor emeritus of music at the University of California, Berkeley. His \u201cRussian Music at Home and Abroad\u201d will appear this fall.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Smartphones Bring More Mobility to the Rental Car Business", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "Supported byWheelsOWNING a car in a congested city like New York or San Francisco can mean more hassle than happiness, what with traffic snarls, limited street parking and expensive garages.But Curtis Rogers has figured out a way to turn those psychic costs into a source of profit. The less he drives, the more he potentially makes.Registering his vehicle on the peer-to-peer car rental company Getaround, Mr. Rogers, who lives in San Francisco, rents out his Toyota Prius by the hour or the day, whenever he does not need it. In the last six months, he has earned an average of $750 a month for essentially doing nothing but acting as his own rent-a-car company.\u201cMy friends and family back in Texas think I\u2019m crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been really surprised by how much money I\u2019ve made.\u2019\u2019Mr. Rogers, whose day job also involves disruptive transportation technology, is an account operations manager for Lyft, the ride-hailing competitor to Uber.Getaround joins companies like Lyft and Uber \u2014 and for that matter, Airbnb \u2014 that enable owners and customers to make use of valuable assets that might otherwise sit idle much of the time.And it is but one example of how smartphone-based technology continues to upend the traditional car rental business, which was long dominated by Avis, Enterprise, Hertz and their various subsidiaries.The conventional car rental companies, which a decade ago had to respond to the rise of digital fleet-rental alternatives like Zipcar \u2014 which Avis ended up buying \u2014 have had little choice but to continue evolving to adapt to smartphone upstarts like Getaround.\u201cFor us, technology is key,\u201d said Sam Zaid, Getaround\u2019s chief executive. \u201cOur technology makes car rental as easy as owning a car.\u201dOperating in 10 cities in the United States, Getaround has signed up about 3,000 car owners. Each owner agrees to let Getaround install a small box under the car\u2019s dashboard, which tracks vehicle diagnostics, pinpoints the car\u2019s location at any moment and keeps track of how the vehicle is being driven. Getaround charges owners $20 a month, and a 40 percent commission on rental fees.To rent a car, which costs $5 to $25 an hour depending on the model, a customer uses the Getaround app to find a nearby vehicle. A grid shows its location and whether and when the car is available. The customer can unlock the vehicle by smartphone, then find a car key that has been hidden within the vehicle.All rental forms are filled out electronically, with no need for the owner and customer to ever meet. The rental rate includes $1 million of insurance coverage, as well as roadside assistance.The Getaround model is meant for cities with concentrated populations, which is why its initial markets also include Portland, Ore., Chicago and Washington.For less densely settled, sprawling metropolises like Los Angeles, there are companies like Skurt, a one-year-old start-up, which will deliver rental cars to customers. After the drop-off, Skurt drivers head back to the office by public transportation, a folding bike or even a skateboard.Like Getaround, Skurt does not own the cars. The company contracts with the major rental companies to make use of their excess capacity. Using the Skurt app, customers choose the models they want, set the drop-off and pickup times and locations, and scan their driver\u2019s licenses. Prices start at about $40 a day.Skurt is aiming at the millennial market. And so, unlike traditional car rental companies, which usually add a surcharge for renters younger than 25, Skurt will rent to drivers as young as 21 at no additional charge.\u201cOur customers don\u2019t consider us as an alternative to car rental companies; they use us as a replacement for car ownership,\u201d said Josh Mangel, 23, one of Skurt\u2019s founders.Skurt\u2019s cars are available in the more heavily populated parts of Los Angeles and neighboring Orange County, with expansion planned soon to San Diego and Austin, Tex.Besides the considerable costs involved in big fleets of vehicles and large chains of airport and storefront retail offices, the conventional rental car companies are also encumbered by longstanding business procedures, which for customers can mean standing in a slow-moving line at a rental agency waiting for a paper rental contract to be issued.That is one reason that earlier this year, Hertz invested in customer convenience by taking a stake in Luxe, a San Francisco start-up that operates as a valet on demand, parking a car when the customer cannot find a space and then handing it back over again when the customer is ready. Although Luxe will park anyone\u2019s car, Hertz plans to make it a service option with some of its rental fleet.To make its valet service feasible, Luxe operates only in parts of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Los Angeles, San Francisco and several other cities. The company returns a car within 30 minutes of the customer\u2019s requesting it.Hertz plans to enhance Luxe\u2019s convenience by having employees pick up and deliver cars for customers who rent away from an airport, wherever they are.\u201cWe\u2019re on the precipice of very significant changes within the company,\u201d said Jeffrey Foland, a Hertz senior executive vice president. Over the next two years, the company will refresh its core technology, including its customer interface and reservations systems. \u201cWe want to make the rental process no more complicated than a couple of clicks on a mobile device.\u201dEnterprise, which also owns the Alamo and National brands, is betting that the best way to reduce the stress of a rental is keeping the customer away from the rental counter. It already operates Enterprise CarShare, a service similar to Zipcar.And now, using Enterprise\u2019s new LaunchPad software, available in 17 North American cities, a customer who has booked a reservation is greeted at the rental agency door by an employee holding a tablet. With LaunchPad, the Enterprise employee has real-time access to the locations of cars in the fleet. The employee uses a prefilled reservation and takes the customer directly to the car.During the car\u2019s inspection, any dings are photographed on the tablet through LaunchPad. When the vehicle is returned, the process is reversed, with a receipt emailed to the renter.\u201cWe\u2019re moving the process from a transaction to an interaction,\u201d said Scott Stephens, an Enterprise assistant vice president.Avis is taking a different approach. With its new Avis Now app, the company\u2019s preferred customers receive automatic notification of the location of their rental vehicle and a picture of it upon reaching the rental lot.Customers can use Avis Now to change cars while still in the lot, confirm fuel level and mileage and return the car without assistance. With Avis vehicles that have connected technology, the app also allows the renter to open the doors and flash the lights to make the car easier to find.Yet none of these advancements address the one basic fact about renting a car: Like borrowed evening wear, it may fit, but it is still not as comfortable as your own.Imagine one day jumping into your rental vehicle and finding your favorite radio stations, seat position and temperature all preconfigured, based on your digital profile. That is a goal that the rental companies say they are pursuing.\u201cThere\u2019s an aligned interest between the car manufacturers, Google, Apple and us,\u201d Mr. Foland of Hertz said. \u201cWe\u2019re working with these parties to have customized vehicles in the near future.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That\u2019s one of several things that often makes China\u2019s market unique in the world, along with a strong nationalist streak, local innovation and good old-fashioned protectionism.Whichever of these you consider paramount, they create a strangely familiar outcome in Uber\u2019s decision to sell its China operations to Didi Chuxing, the local version of Uber\u2019s ride-hailing service.In the business of technology infrastructure, China has also been a tough market. Cisco Systems manages to sell some products, but it has lost much business to Huawei, a Chinese maker of internet gear. Cisco once sued Huawei, accusing it of copying Cisco\u2019s stuff, but it now says relations are fine. They are, except Huawei executives privately fume at the difficulties they have entering the American market.The way Cisco and Huawei dominate their home markets and the way local Chinese cloud companies are likely to have a big role in China but little elsewhere for now suggest a likely fate for Didi-Uber: The Chinese company gets its big market, and the Americans get theirs, and much of the world besides. Don\u2019t expect to see a big push by Didi in, say, Europe, where Uber already has operations.For now. After all, China is a huge market.

{"Headline": "Memorial in Alabama Will Honor Victims of Lynching", "Date": "2016-08-15", "News": "Supported byOne day in October 1910, a mob of white people in Montgomery, Ala., tried to seize and lynch several black men who were being held in a downtown jail on suspicion of interracial sexual relations.Unsuccessful, the angry mob found a black man named John Dell sitting nearby in the taxi cab he drove. They shot him dead. No one was prosecuted, and Mr. Dell, as with roughly a dozen other lynching victims in the city\u2019s history, was essentially unacknowledged.Next year, not far from the site of Mr. Dell\u2019s death, one of the first \u2014 and certainly the largest \u2014 memorials to the victims of the thousands of racial lynchings in United States history is scheduled to open.The group will also unveil plans for a museum to open in April, in its roughly 11,000-square-foot headquarters, that will trace the country\u2019s racial history from slavery to the era of mass incarceration.The memorial will sit on six acres, the highest spot in the first capital of the Confederacy, on the site of what used to be a public housing complex.\u201cOur goal isn\u2019t to be divisive,\u201d said Bryan Stevenson, the director of the Equal Justice Initiative. \u201cOur goal is just to get people to confront the truth of our past with some more courage.\u201dThe museum and memorial project, for which Mr. Stevenson said he had raised about 40 percent of a projected $20 million, is the latest and most ambitious undertaking in a continuing effort by Mr. Stevenson to change public awareness of the nation\u2019s racial history.Contributors to the project include the Ford Foundation and Google.Designed in partnership with MASS, a Boston-based design group, the memorial will be made up of two parts.One is a large, four-sided gallery of 801 suspended six-foot columns, representing a county where a lynching took place and etched with the name of the person or people lynched \u2014 a term not limited to hangings.Duplicates of those columns will be placed in an adjacent field.People will be encouraged to retrieve the columns in the field and place them as markers in their home counties.The locations of lynchings from 1877 to 1950.The aim, he said, mentioning the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, is to be forthright about the horrors that were part of the nation\u2019s racial history and their continuity from slavery through Jim Crow to the present day.After that report, Mr. Stevenson launched a project to collect soil from unmarked lynching sites around the country. The soil will be placed in glass jars that will be on display at the museum.\u201cI\u2019m sure that there will be some people that will say, \u2018Why?\u2019\u201d he said in a phone interview.\u201cBut from our standpoint, the \u2018why\u2019 is to tell the story, and to tell it in a fashion that people want to come and see it. And spend money when they come to town.\u201dThe museum, called \u201cFrom Enslavement to Mass Incarceration,\u201d will be in the headquarters of the Equal Justice Initiative, a site in downtown Montgomery that was once a slave warehouse.Mr. Stevenson said the museum would have databases for historical research and virtual reality stations so people could begin to understand what it was like to be in the cargo hold of a slave trafficking ship, to endure angry taunts during a lunch counter sit-in and to sit, in the present day, in an overcrowded prison.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In the U.S., VW Owners Get Cash. In Europe, They Get Plastic Tubes.", "Date": "2016-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe startling gap in treatment is the result of European laws that shield corporations from class-action suits brought by unhappy consumers. Now a group of online legal start-ups wants to change the status quo.The campaigns are attracting people like J\u00fcrgen Franz, a retired advertising executive in Munich who says his Volkswagen, a diesel Tiguan sport utility vehicle, burns more fuel after a software update that was part of a mandatory recall. He drives the same route every morning and now fills his tank more often.\u201cWhy are they getting so much and we\u2019re getting nothing?\u201d Mr. Franz said of American owners.Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers hope the efforts will signal a turning point in European jurisprudence, opening up a clearer path for aggrieved customers to join forces across borders to sue big corporations. The case could be the largest consumer action of its kind in Europe.Owners\u2019 representatives in Europe are seeking a maximum of 5,000 euros per car, or about $5,600, much less than in the United States. But even that figure could be financially devastating. There are 8.5 million tainted diesels in Europe, compared with about 500,000 in the United States that are covered by the settlement.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.European governments, traditionally deferential to Volkswagen, one of the region\u2019s largest employers, have joined in as well. The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, is coordinating efforts by national consumer groups to collect money from the carmaker. And the German state of Bavaria says it will sue Volkswagen on behalf of its employees\u2019 pension fund, which owns sharply devalued shares in the company.The biggest financial threat may come from new online businesses that have found ways around European obstacles to class-action suits.While laws vary, most European countries do not allow large class actions of the variety that led to the $15 billion settlement in the United States. Nor do many European countries, including Germany, allow lawyers to work on commission, so customers who sue companies risk paying not only their own legal fees but also the other side\u2019s if they lose.That is in contrast to the United States, where it is standard practice for lawyers to collect a hefty percentage of the award if a suit is successful and nothing if it\u2019s not.The start-ups are taking advantage of a loophole that allows European consumers to sign over their legal claims to third-party service providers, which then try to recover damages. And the internet has made it possible to recruit huge numbers of consumers who share similar gripes.People who search Google for the German words for \u201cVolkswagen damage claim\u201d see an ad for the website My-right.de, one of several start-ups using the internet to recruit Volkswagen owners. In Paris, Weclaim.com is attracting French customers. Both websites have teamed up with lawyers and are expanding into other European countries.The companies use technology to automate the laborious task of processing the claims, and usually find investors to finance legal costs in return for a share of the eventual judgment. The result is a de facto class action.\u201cThe model has existed for a long time,\u201d said Sven Bode, managing director of Financialright, the Hamburg-based company that owns My-right.de. \u201cWhat is new is that we can do it on a massive basis.\u201dMr. Bode has previously overseen efforts to help airline passengers obtain compensation for canceled or delayed flights, and to pressure banks to refund improper fees. But because Volkswagen is Europe\u2019s largest carmaker by far, Mr. Bode said, \u201cthis is a unique dimension.\u201dBecause the start-ups are considered collection agencies rather than law firms, they are allowed to work on commission. Clients who sign up agree to pay about a third of any money they collect, similar to contingency fees for lawyers in the United States. The Volkswagen owners owe nothing if the efforts to collect are unsuccessful.About 100,000 Volkswagen owners have registered with My-right.de so far, said Christopher Rother, managing partner of the law firm Hausfeld in Berlin, which is working with the website. The firm\u2019s founder, Michael Hausfeld, who is based in Washington, is one of the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers leading the class action against Volkswagen in the United States.That is only about 5 percent of the eligible owners in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Mr. Rother said the goal was to assemble at least 400,000 customers and collect up to \u20ac5,000 for each one.Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Pelouze, chief executive of Weclaim.com, the Paris-based website that is recruiting owners, said the carmaker was underestimating how vulnerable it was to new legal strategies. \u201cThe rules are changing, and I don\u2019t think Volkswagen is getting it,\u201d Mr. Pelouze said.For now, Volkswagen is standing firm.The American settlement allows owners to sell their cars back to Volkswagen at the pre-scandal price or take the cars in for an emissions upgrade, in addition to a cash payout of up to $10,000. All told, about $10 billion is earmarked for the buybacks, recalls and compensation, or about $20,000 per car.But the company has refused to give European owners any money or to buy back cars, disputing claims that diesels in Europe have lost value. It argues that dealers will be able to bring the cars in line with pollution standards without any decline in performance or fuel economy.Volkswagen has also refused to negotiate with owners\u2019 representatives. \u201cOur view is that there is no legal basis for customer claims,\u201d the company said in a statement.The carmaker has begun recalls in Germany that it plans to replicate in other countries. Vehicle owners will receive the software update and, in some cases, a tubular plastic \u201cflow transformer\u201d designed to improve air flow in the engine and to reduce emissions.That\u2019s it.But as in the United States, many people in Europe bought Volkswagen diesels thinking they were doing something good for the environment, only to learn that the cars emit far more poisonous nitrogen oxides than allowed.Guy Samson, a retired electrician who lives outside Paris, said that his friends gave him a hard time about his diesel Tiguan, and that its resale value had plunged.\u201cPeople, friends, they look at you and they kind of make fun of you behind your back,\u201d Mr. Samson said. \u201cEven to your face sometimes.\u201dMartin de Bourmont contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber to Sell to Rival Didi Chuxing and Create New Business in China", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Uber\u2019s future in China seemed to hold promise.The sale, which would create a new company worth about $35 billion, would end the great ride-hailing battle of China. A person with knowledge of the deal said Uber investors had been pushing for such a transaction.The companies have been fighting relentlessly for market share in mainland China for two years, spending tens of millions of dollars every month to attract riders and drivers. The merger would end that competition and create significant scale, but it would also be a repudiation of Uber\u2019s ambitions to take on local Chinese competitors in their huge home market.Uber had pushed its way into a country that has gone almost untouched by major American tech companies in recent years. Its progress was widely watched and discussed by entrepreneurs and investors alike as a model for how to reach China\u2019s 600 million internet users \u2014 a forbidding prospect considering the country\u2019s well-funded local competitors and regulations aimed at blocking foreign businesses.With the deal, the company will join the ranks of American peers like Google and eBay, which were unable to capitalize on early footholds in China. EBay was outmaneuvered by Alibaba, while Google left China after it said it was the target of government-sponsored cyberattacks.Still, it is by no means a financial catastrophe for Uber, which for about $2 billion of investment in the Chinese market gets a $7 billion share in a company that is likely to grow. It also saves the cash it may have spent competing in China for other projects.\u201cHowever, as an entrepreneur, I\u2019ve learned that being successful is about listening to your head as well as following your heart,\u201d he wrote. \u201cUber and Didi Chuxing are investing billions of dollars in China and both companies have yet to turn a profit there.\u201dUnder the terms of the deal, the new company\u2019s estimated worth is a combination of Didi Chuxing\u2019s $28 billion valuation and Uber China\u2019s $7 billion, according to two people with knowledge of the deal, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the information had not yet been made public. Uber shareholders would receive a 20 percent stake in the new company.Over the past two years, Uber upended expectations in China and its business there grew, despite heavy regulation and internet filters that often limit access to the products of foreign tech companies. The early 2015 rollout of People\u2019s Uber, a service that got ordinary Chinese drivers behind the wheel and taking passengers, helped Uber grab a chunk of market share from Didi.As it grew in China, Uber avoided many of the mistakes made by of its American tech forebears. For one, the company created local teams based around different cities, allowing it to respond quickly and flexibly to moves by the competition. That set it apart from other companies, which sought to control Chinese operations from the United States, slowing their responses.But entry is just the first obstacle to the Chinese internet market. Competition is fierce, and the focus is less on the product than on big spending to lure customers or on tricks to harm competitors. Fraudsters and opportunists also abound.Uber\u2019s engineers, operating from San Francisco, had to deal with drivers who simulated or faked rides to get commissions. At the same time, the company was blocked from marketing on China\u2019s biggest social network, WeChat, because the internet giant Tencent was an early investor in Didi. All of that made it much harder to compete with a company that already had an advantage in scale, not to mention the backing of Tencent, Alibaba and Apple. When it raised $7 billion in June, Didi made it clear it was willing to continue the fight for a long time.For all the publicity around the spat between Uber and Didi, the two had been in talks stretching back to the Didi-Kuaidi merger in the beginning of 2015, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. That person said the two sides could not overcome disagreements about valuations at the time.In another quirk to the latest deal, two members of the same well-known family in the world of technology were on opposite sides of the negotiating table: Didi\u2019s president, Jean Liu, is the daughter of Liu Chuanzhi, the Chinese founder of the largest computer maker in the world, Lenovo. Her cousin, Zhen Liu, is a vice president and regular spokeswoman for Uber China.Although the tie-up is expected to reassure investors, Chinese analysts said it would probably lead to a decrease in commissions. That could hurt customers and drivers alike, the analysts said, making it harder for smaller players to compete because their larger rival would no longer be saddled with such an expense.\u201cFor smaller companies like Yidao or Shenzhou, if they keep subsidizing users, it will only be temporary and will bring more financial burdens,\u201d said Hong Bo, an independent technology analyst in China.Li Bo, a 22-year-old driver from Henan, said the loyalty of drivers is determined by where they could get the best pay. That meant they would continue to follow the subsidies, he said.\u201cAll we care is who gives us the best deal,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Didi buys Uber, we just work for Didi. It doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201dPaul Mozur reported from Hong Kong, and Mike Isaac from San Francisco. Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting from New York.

{"Headline": "Apple, Congress and the Missing Taxes", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "Supported byEditorialApple and the United States are crying foul over the ruling in Europe that Apple received illegal tax breaks from Ireland and must hand over 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion), a record tax penalty in Europe.But Apple and the United States have only themselves to blame for the situation.Initially, deferral was a convenience for multinationals, as they sought investment opportunities abroad. Today, it is the taproot of global tax avoidance. Financial engineering has let American companies shift profits into foreign accounts, while they lobby Congress for tax-rate cuts in exchange for repatriating the money. Currently, there is some $2 trillion in corporate profits in offshore tax-deferred accounts; besides Apple, Microsoft, Google, Cisco and Oracle also have large stashes. Apple is one of nearly two dozen major corporations pushing Congress for a \u201ctax holiday,\u201d which would let companies bring back foreign-held money over the course of a year at a discounted tax rate, rather than the current rate, 35 percent.Before the European ruling on Tuesday, the debate over a tax holiday had pitted Republicans, who have generally favored the idea, against Democrats, who have viewed it as an unjustified reward for tax avoidance. The Democrats have history on their side. A tax holiday in 2005 lowered the corporate rate to 5.25 percent, enticing corporations to repatriate some $300 billion. It was billed as a way to create jobs and increase investment, but the money was used mostly for dividend payments, share buybacks (which tend to raise executive pay) and severance for laid-off employees. Worse, the tax holiday inspired multinationals to stash as much money abroad as they possibly could in anticipation of another holiday.The European ruling, however, could sharply alter the terms of the congressional debate. Republicans and Democrats alike have always assumed that foreign-held profits would one day be repatriated. The big question was the rate at which they would ultimately be taxed. Similarly, the Treasury assumes that deferred foreign profits will one day be taxed when it projects future revenues \u2014 an important measure of the nation\u2019s fiscal health.But the money won\u2019t be repatriated and taxed under American law if Europeans, in the course of enforcing their own laws against tax havens, get their hands on it first. And that, in a nutshell, is why members of Congress and Treasury officials are so upset about the Apple ruling. They understand, correctly, that tax-law enforcement in Europe could reduce the sums they expect to collect taxes on someday. What they don\u2019t understand, or aren\u2019t saying, is that they brought the problem on themselves.The way forward is not to declare a tax war with Europe. It is for Congress to agree on a way to tax foreign-held corporate profits. President Obama put forth a reasonable approach in 2015, when he proposed a mandatory 14 percent tax on multinationals\u2019 current offshore profits \u2014 whether they are repatriated or not \u2014 and, thereafter, a new minimum tax rate of 19 percent on profits moved offshore. An even better approach would be to simply end indefinite corporate tax deferral, imposing American taxes on profits when they are made.Republicans rejected Mr. Obama\u2019s proposal in 2015, and there is no chance that lawmakers will engage in such a debate so close to the election. But the next president and Congress will need to act to ensure that at long last, American corporations pay their fair share in taxes.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alphabet Expands Car-Pooling Project, Casting Shadow on Uber", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Alphabet and Uber are inching closer to a showdown.Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is broadening the scope of a car-pooling program that could challenge ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft. The pilot program, operated through Google\u2019s navigation app Waze, is limited to employees of companies near Google\u2019s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif.In the fall, Waze plans to expand the program to users in San Francisco, where Uber is based, according to a person briefed on the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly about it.Unlike ride services that summon drivers immediately, Waze suggests calling for a ride a few hours in advance. When a user wants a ride in the same direction, Waze offers the driver a price to pick up that passenger.For now, Waze is keeping the cost of rides below the federal standard mileage rates of 54 cents a mile, making it impractical for drivers to make a living from driving. Under its terms of service, Google said it may deduct \u201ca commission\u201d from the price of the ride.Google\u2019s expansion of the program is another indication of the intensifying competition between the two companies. As the company toes the waters of the ride-hailing industry, Uber has made clear its intentions to break into autonomous vehicle technology, a longtime area of interest for Google and its self-driving car experimentation.Next month, Uber plans to start its first pilot program of self-driving cars in Pittsburgh, home to the ride-hailing firm\u2019s autonomous technology research efforts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Once a Bucknell Professor, Now the Commander of an Ethiopian Rebel Army", "Date": "2016-08-31", "News": "FeatureWhy Berhanu Nega traded a tenured position for the chance to lead a revolutionary force against an oppressive regime.Supported byNega remained vague about his past. But students curious enough to Google him would discover that the man who stood before them, outlining development policies in sub-Saharan Africa, was in fact intimately involved in the long-running hostility between Ethiopia and neighboring Eritrea, a conflict that has dragged on for half a century. By the start of the millennium, its newest incarnation, a border war over a patch of seemingly worthless ground just 250 square miles in size, devolved into a tense standoff, with the two nations each massing along the border thousands of troops from both official and unofficial armies. One proxy army fighting on the Eritrean side, a group of disaffected Ethiopians called Ginbot 7, was a force that Nega helped create, founding the movement in 2008 with another Ethiopian exile, Andargachew Tsege, in Washington. The Ethiopian government, which had previously detained Nega as a political prisoner for two years in Addis Ababa, now sentenced him to death in absentia. Bucknell students who did learn about their teacher\u2019s past were thrilled. \u201cIt made his classes exciting,\u201d Rickard says.In Ginbot 7, Tsege served as the political leader based in Eritrea; Nega was the group\u2019s intellectual leader and principal fund-raiser, collecting money from members of the Ethiopian diaspora in Europe and the United States. That all changed one day in June 2014, when Tsege, known to everyone as Andy, made a brief stopover in Sanaa, the capital of Yemen, on his way to Asmara, the capital of Eritrea. As he sat in the airport transit lounge, waiting to board his flight, Yemeni security forces, apparently acting in collusion with Ethiopian intelligence, arrested him and put him on a plane to Addis Ababa, where he was paraded on state television and currently faces a death sentence.Days after Tsege\u2019s arrest and extradition, Nega volunteered to replace him in Eritrea. \u201cWas I going to remain an academic, sitting in an ivory tower criticizing things?\u201d he told me. \u201cOr was I going to do something as an engaged citizen?\u201d Nega put his house up for sale and took an indefinite leave of absence from the university. It was an extended sabbatical, he told his colleagues. Only a handful of close friends, his wife and his two sons knew the truth.\u201cThey\u2019ve got documents, and they insist on handing them over only to me,\u201d Nega told me. \u201cWhen there is sensitive material, they first want me to see it and then filter the information to the rest of the organization.\u201d Nega, a burly, balding 58-year-old with a rumpled facade and an appealingly unassuming manner, rubbed his forehead as the lights flickered and then returned. In recent years, Ginbot 7 has grown, and it is now guided by an 80-member council of representatives spread around the world. As commander, Nega oversees several hundred rebel fighters in Eritrea as well as an unknown number of armed members inside Ethiopia who carry out occasional attacks in the movement\u2019s name. During his frequent visits to the front lines, he spends his time meeting with fellow commanders, observing training and \u2014 ever the professor \u2014 leading history and democracy seminars using chalk and a blackboard in a \u201cclassroom\u201d in the bush.Nega turned back to the map and traced a straight line leading to the Tekeze River, the westernmost border between Ethiopia and Eritrea. The stream was a main crossing point for Ethiopian Army deserters fleeing to the rebels, and in recent weeks it had come under threat from advancing Ethiopian troops. \u201cThey are moving a sizable force into this area, because we are their main target now,\u201d he said, referring to Ginbot 7, now known as Patriotic Ginbot 7. \u201cAnd they are pushing a large part of their army, artillery and tanks into this zone. They haven\u2019t started shelling us yet.\u201dThe two nations, now ferocious enemies, were once joined. Eritrea, an Italian colony from 1890 until 1941, was annexed by Ethiopia after World War II; it took a three-decades-long war for the Eritreans to finally liberate themselves, in 1991. The neighbors remained at peace until 1998, when a simmering dispute over the Yirga triangle, a piece of rocky land along the border that had never been clearly demarcated in colonial maps, exploded into two years of tank and trench warfare in which 100,000 died. Today, despite a United Nations-supervised mediation that awarded the disputed territory to Eritrea, Ethiopia continues to occupy the border village Badame. Tens of thousands of troops face each other across a landscape of mines, bunkers, sniper posts and other fortifications.Violence on the border, while infrequent, can be both sudden and brutal. In mid-June, according to the Eritrean government, Ethiopia launched a full-scale attack along the frontier at Tsorona, the first major incursion since 2012, possibly in retaliation for attacks on its forces by Ginbot 7. Eritrea claimed that it had killed 200 enemy soldiers and wounded 300, though Ethiopia downplayed its losses. \u201cThey almost always deny it,\u201d Nega told me. \u201cAs far as the Ethiopian government is concerned, nobody ever dies.\u201dEthiopia, while an American ally and an economic leader by African standards, is notoriously repressive. The minority Tigrayan regime has jailed hundreds of bloggers, journalists and opposition figures, keeping itself in power by intimidating political opponents, rigging elections and violently putting down protests. Since November of last year, according to Human Rights Watch, state security forces killed more than 400 protesters in the Oromia region, which surrounds Addis Ababa. Protests have recently spread to the Amhara region, as well; in August, security forces shot dead roughly 100 demonstrators and injured hundreds more. Thousands of Oromos, a minority group that makes up about a third of the population, have been jailed without trial on suspicion of supporting the Oromo Liberation Front, a secessionist group. The Ethiopian marathoner Feyisa Lilesa, who won the silver medal at the Olympics this year, drew global attention to the government\u2019s abuses when he held his crossed arms over his head at the finish line in solidarity with his fellow Oromos; he says he fears returning home and is seeking political asylum.The house also serves as an infirmary for rebels who become ill or are wounded in combat, and it provides a temporary sanctuary for Ethiopian Army defectors who cross the front lines. One recent arrival was a former Ethiopian Air Force officer, an Oromo who had traveled north 42 hours by bus and on foot, then swum across the Tekeze River to Eritrea. He made the decision to defect while sitting in an Addis Ababa jail cell on \u201cfalse charges,\u201d he told me, of being a member of the Oromo secessionist movement.\u201cWe have many like him,\u201d Nega said.Nega put on his jacket to head off in search of diesel fuel for the morning journey to the border. With another rebel comrade from Virginia, we drove down the deserted, lightless streets of Asmara, searching for an open filling station, but the one we found had run out of diesel; Nega would have to return the next morning, delaying his departure for the front lines. When we returned to his home, Nega pointed to a pile of medical supplies in the hallway \u2014 bandages, splints, antibiotics, antimalarials \u2014 that he was planning to ferry to his fighters, and three cardboard boxes packed with solar cells that would provide some rudimentary electricity in the bush. While in the camps, Nega was dependent on his mobile phone for contact with the outside world, but even that was not guaranteed. \u201cThey have shut off phone coverage since the incursion\u201d by the Ethiopians at Tsorona, he told me. \u201cI\u2019ll be out of touch for days.\u201dWe met over Memorial Day weekend on the terrace of the upscale Caf\u00e9 Dupont on Dupont Circle in Washington, joined by his sister Hiwot, who runs a technology start-up in New York, and Iyassu, a 21-year-old former high-school track star who was starting work at a New York investment bank in the fall. Over white wine and chicken salad, the conversation touched on Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s commencement address and Nega\u2019s excitement over crossing paths, after the ceremony, with Donald Trump and Vice President Joe Biden. (Trump\u2019s daughter and Biden\u2019s granddaughter were members of Iyassu\u2019s graduating class.) I asked Iyassu if he had reconciled himself to the idea of his father\u2019s new life on the front lines, and he said that he had. \u201cUltimately he should continue to pursue what he believes in,\u201d he told me. He expressed little interest, though, in visiting his father at his Eritrean rebel camp or delving deeper into the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the Ginbot 7 movement. \u201cI just got out of college \u2014 my life has its own direction,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t take time off. ... I\u2019m a little bit removed generationally as well.\u201dThe elder Nega is part of a generation of Ethiopians who grew up amid violence and tumult. Over lunch, he recalled what it was like to be a high-school student when a Marxist junta, the Soviet-backed Derg, overthrew Emperor Haile Selassie and ushered in a brutal dictatorship. Nega had grown up privileged, the son of a wealthy entrepreneur, and he watched as his father\u2019s vast commercial corn and soybean farms were seized and security forces began arresting, imprisoning and executing thousands of dissidents, including many students. He and his two older sisters joined a resistance movement called the Ethiopian People\u2019s Revolutionary Party (E.P.R.P.). They went underground, living in safe houses, eluding the police. His eldest sister was later captured and disappeared in the Derg\u2019s prisons. His family searched for her everywhere.\u201cWe had people coming to our house and telling my parents, \u2018I saw her at this place.\u2019 My mother used to go out all over looking for her,\u201d Nega recalls. Her former cellmates later told him that she had died in prison, probably by committing suicide with a cyanide capsule that she wore around her neck. \u201cIt was common to have cyanide with you because if you were caught, you would be tortured and executed, and through torture you might be forced to betray people,\u201d Nega said. As the crackdown in Addis intensified, the E.P.R.P. sent Nega north to Tigray province, the center of a growing guerrilla war against the Derg; there, he carried out attacks on government forces. In 1978 a power struggle erupted within the E.P.R.P. leadership, and Nega was thrown into prison. He was released one day before guards turned their guns on the remaining prisoners, killing 15. Nega escaped to Sudan, living as a refugee in Khartoum for nearly two years, then obtained political asylum in the United States in 1980.He earned his bachelor\u2019s degree from the State University of New York at New Paltz, where he also played on the soccer team. While studying for his doctorate at the New School for Social Research, he lived in Brooklyn and wrote his dissertation on the failures of Ethiopian agriculture under the Communist regime. Meanwhile, Ethiopia was sliding deeper into calamity. When the guerrilla movements increased their attacks in Tigray in the mid-1980s, the Derg dictator, Mengistu Haile Mariam, blocked food supplies to the region, creating a devastating famine in which one million people died. Photographs of starving children, disseminated by the news media, catalyzed an international relief effort, Live Aid, and inspired the pop hit \u201cWe Are the World,\u201d making Ethiopia a worldwide synonym for hunger. The famine had wound down, and the rebel war was escalating, when Bucknell hired Nega as an assistant professor in 1990. \u201cHe never trumpeted his background, the fact that he had been a guerrilla fighter,\u201d says Dean Baker, a former Bucknell colleague who now heads the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington.In 1991, after a decade\u2019s struggle, three rebel groups \u2014 the Tigrayan People\u2019s Liberation Front, the Oromo Liberation Front and the Eritrean People\u2019s Liberation Front \u2014 defeated the Derg and marched into Addis Ababa. The new government, led by the Tigrayan rebel leader Meles Zenawi, set about rebuilding the war-shattered nation. Nega finally had reason for optimism. He knew Meles well \u2014 the prime minister had been in the same university class as his dead sister \u2014 and after the Tigrayans consolidated power, Nega obtained a leave of absence from Bucknell and flew with his wife and two sons, both toddlers, back to Addis, determined to help rebuild the country. Nega believed that Meles \u201chad good intentions,\u201d he told me.But Nega\u2019s enthusiasm for the new government wore off quickly. At Addis Ababa University, where he taught part-time (he had also taken over several of his father\u2019s businesses), administrators cracked down on dissent, banning the student government and the school newspaper. When Nega encouraged his students to press for academic freedoms, police assaulted them and other demonstrators; later, as unrest spread through the city, they shot 41 people dead. Nega spent a month in jail for abetting the protests. \u201cAt night I was hearing prisoners being tortured, beaten,\u201d he says.In May 2005, with the economy growing rapidly and the government\u2019s popularity appar\u00adently high, Ethiopia held elections, the first truly multiparty vote in Ethiopia\u2019s history, and invited international observers to attend. But the results were not to Meles\u2019s liking. Nega\u2019s Coalition for Unity and Democracy won 137 of the 138 seats on the City Council in Addis Ababa. Nega was poised to become mayor, but the government denied his party the victory and jailed him along with other C.U.D. leaders. American colleagues began a campaign to free Nega. \u201cThe Bucknell faculty approved a motion to support him and call attention to his plight,\u201d Rickard says. \u201cWe talked with journalists, ambassadors, trying to make sure that he stayed on the front burner.\u201d International pressure helped to secure Nega\u2019s release after 21 months, and he returned to the United States. The experience \u201chardened him,\u201d says Samuel Adamassu, a member of the Ethio\u00adpian diaspora who has known Nega and his family since the 1980s. \u201cIt made him realize these people are not willing to change without being forced.\u201dWhen Nega helped found the Ginbot 7 movement in 2008, the year he returned to teaching at Bucknell, he explained that the movement would seek to \u201corganize civil disobedience and help the existing armed movements\u201d inside and outside Ethiopia and \u201cput pressure on the government, and the international community, to come to a negotiation.\u201d Yet the Ginbot 7 platform advocated destabilizing the government \u201cby any means necessary,\u201d including attacks on soldiers and police. It was a discordant message coming out of a liberal American university whose first class was held in the basement of the First Baptist Church of Lewisburg in 1846. \u201cIt\u2019s a line that he has crossed,\u201d says Rickard, the English professor, who finds Nega\u2019s advocacy of violence \u201ctroubling\u201d but understandable. \u201cHe has never been a pacifist, never renounced armed struggle,\u201d he says. \u201cHe has seen elections overturned, hundreds of people murdered on the streets. His sister died, and his best friend is in prison, in peril of his life. He sees violence as viable and necessary. It\u2019s kind of shocking, in a way.\u201dWhile Ginbot 7 started to foment its resistance, Ethiopia was busy rebranding itself as an economic success story. Following South Korean and Chinese models of state-directed development, Meles borrowed from state-owned banks and used Western aid money to invest heavily in dams, airlines, agriculture, education and health care. Ethiopia\u2019s economy took off, averaging nearly 11 percent growth per year for the last decade, one of the highest rates in Africa. Addis Ababa became the showpiece of the country\u2019s transformation, with a light rail system, ubiquitous high-rise construction and luxury hotels, high-end restaurants and wine bars packed with newly minted millionaires. At the same time, the country was becoming a bulwark against the spread of radical Islam in the Horn of Africa. Today Ethiopia provides 4,400 peacekeepers to an African Union force in Somalia and helps keep the peace along the tense border between North and South Sudan. In July 2015 President Obama, on an African tour, paid the first visit ever to Ethiopia by a sitting American president.Yet in the classroom and abroad, Nega argued that Ethiopia\u2019s transformation was a mirage, created to placate Western observers troubled by the lack of democracy. \u201cIn 2005, it became clear that legitimacy would not come through the political process, so they started this new narrative \u2014 development,\u201d he told me. Nega insists that Ethiopia has \u201ccooked the books,\u201d and that its growth rate is largely attributable to huge infrastructure projects and Western development aid, with little contribution from the private sector. \u201cThe World Bank is throwing money at Ethiopia like there\u2019s no tomorrow,\u201d he told me. The actual growth rate, he insists, is closer to 5 to 6 percent \u2014 per capita income is still among the lowest in the world \u2014 and the weakness of the country\u2019s institutions will mean that even this rate cannot be sustained.Two months before Obama arrived, the government presided over what was widely considered a sham election, in which the ruling party won all 547 seats in Parliament, But Obama, making it clear that security trumped other concerns in the Horn of Africa, stood beside Meles\u2019s successor, Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn, and described the government as being \u201cdemocratically elected.\u201d\u201cI was shocked,\u201d Nega told me. \u201c I understand the reality of power and why he supports the Ethiopian government, but to say it is \u2018democratically elected\u2019? I was disgusted.\u201dImmediately following its independence in the early 1990s, under the rebel-leader-turned-president Isaias Afwerki, Eritrea was briefly considered one of the hopes of Africa. When I visited the country in 1996, five years after it won its liberation from Ethiopia, the former rebels were starting to revive the wrecked economy \u2014 rebuilding roads, bridges and a railway to the coast, calling on the Eritrean diaspora to invest. But after the border war between 1998 and 2000, Eritrea\u2019s leadership turned inward, growing increasingly suspicious of the outside world. Afwerki suppressed dissent, expelled Western journalists and NGOs, turned down foreign aid, nationalized industries and discouraged foreign investment; according to the World Bank, per capita income is about $1,400 a year. In 2009 the United Nations Security Council imposed sanctions on Eritrea, including an arms em\u00adbargo and a travel ban and a freeze on the assets of top Eritrean officials, for providing weapons to the Shabab, the radical Islamist group that has carried out hundreds of terrorist attacks in Somalia and neighboring Kenya. (Eritrea called the allegation \u201cfabricated lies.\u201d) A June 2016 United Nations report accused the Eritrean government of committing \u201ccrimes against human\u00adity,\u201d including torture, jailing dissidents and the open-ended military conscription program that the government justifies as preparation against another Ethiopian invasion.With virtually no investment coming into the country, Asmara has become a city frozen in time. Two donkeys meandered down Harnet Avenue, the capital\u2019s main boulevard, stopping to nibble at a patch of grass around a palm tree. As we watched the crowds walk down the tidy avenue lined by an imposing red brick cathedral, a 1930s-era Art Deco movie theater and crumbling Italian bakeries and cappuccino bars, Nega defended his decision to turn to the dictatorship for support.\u201cDo we really have to discuss the kind of dictatorships that the U.S. sleeps with?\u201d he asked me. \u201cHere is a country that was willing to give us sanctuary, a country that had once been part of Ethiopia. I look at any of these people, I talk to them, and they are just like me, they are as Ethiopian as I am. Why should I not get help from them?\u201dNega insisted that he saw some positives in the dictatorship. \u201cThis is the only country that says, despite its poverty, \u2018We are going to chart our own course \u2014 whether you like it or not,\u2019\u2009\u201d he told me. \u201cThey are not corrupt. You see these government officials driving 1980s cars, torn down the middle. I have seen their lives, their houses. There is some element of a David-and-Goliath struggle in this thing.\u201d He called the United Nations report describing crimes against humanity an \u201cexaggeration.\u201d (A Western diplomat in Asmara I talked to, who asked not to be identified because of the political sensitivities of his position, agreed with Nega\u2019s assessment of the report, saying it was based on testimony of refugees in Europe who had \u201can interest in depicting their country as badly as possible to justify their status.\u201d)It goes without saying that Nega was reluctant to speak harshly about the nation that was providing his movement with a refuge \u2014 and that could snatch it away at any moment. \u201cI don\u2019t want to butt into their personal issues,\u201d he said carefully. \u201cThey\u2019ve always been nice to us.\u201d Out of the public eye, however, the rebel leader can be more critical. \u201cHe holds no illusions about Eritrea,\u201d says his friend and former Bucknell colleague Dean Baker.I asked Nega if he was confident that pressure by the rebel groups could bring down the Ethiopian government. Nega believed that momentum was on his side. \u201cThis resistance to the state is coming in every direction now, in all parts of the country,\u201d he said. He was giving himself \u201cfour or five years\u201d before he and his rebel forces entered Ethiopia as part of a new democratic dispensation. \u201cIt certainly won\u2019t be a decade,\u201d he told me.Until that happens, Nega will continue planning and preparing from a precarious and lonely limbo. Back at the bungalow, he led me down the corridor and showed me where he slept: a monastic chamber furnished with a single bed, an armoire and a night table strewn with jars of vitamins and blood-pressure medication. (He lost his medical insurance when he left Bucknell, but still has American insurance coverage through his wife, and he picked up a three-month supply of the medicine on his May trip to the United States.) He retrieved from the freezer a chilled bottle of Absolut and poured two glasses. We sat in the concrete courtyard, beside a clothesline draped with Nega\u2019s laundry. The power failed again, casting us into total darkness, then returned a few seconds later. The contrast with his previous life in the States \u2014 cheering for the Lewisburg Green Dragons, his son\u2019s high-school track team; vacationing on the beaches of Maryland and North Carolina with his extended family \u2014 could hardly have been more extreme.\u201cIf you like comfort, and that\u2019s what drives you, you\u2019ll never do this,\u201d he told me, taking a sip of the ice-cold vodka. \u201cBut sometimes you get really surprised. Once you have a commitment to something, all these things that you thought were normal in your day-to-day life become unnecessary luxuries.\u201dJoshua Hammer is a freelance foreign correspondent and the author of \u201cThe Bad-Ass Librarians of Timbuktu.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Squarest, Man", "Date": "2016-08-28", "News": "Supported byWordplayMONDAY PUZZLE \u2014 Every now and then, we hear from solvers who believe that the New York Times crossword relies too heavily on New York-centric entries. The last several days should have put that to rest.Mr. Steinberg goes into detail in his notes below about how he developed his WYOMING theme, but what I liked most about it is that he was able to place the four landmarks in their correct geographic positions. That\u2019s a nice bit of constructing serendipity.We\u2019ve got the name of the square state, WYOMING, in the middle of the grid and OLD FAITHFUL in the northwest, DEVIL\u2019S TOWER in the northeast, JACKSON HOLE toward the west and FORT LARAMIE in the south east.Sometimes Monday puzzle clues can be a bit too straightforward for my tastes. I like a bit of wordplay in my clues, but I understand that it\u2019s tricky to keep clues at a Monday-level easiness. Today we have some fun clues, and I think that as long as you understand what those question-marked clues are asking of you, you shouldn\u2019t have too much of a problem solving this puzzle.\u2022 19A: This clue is asking you to think of a punny answer to \u201cGood job for an animal-loving ex-G. I.?\u201d An ex-G. I. would be a VET and, as an animal lover, a VETerinarian would be an appropriate job.\u2022 40D: If you struggle with a clue that sounds vague on first reading, break it down. The clue says, \u201cCBS spinoff set in SoCal,\u201d so you can almost bet that L.A. will be in there somewhere. From there, work the crossings.I constructed this puzzle over my college\u2019s spring break. I\u2019ve recently been trying to come up with themes involving grid art, since I always find it really elegant when I\u2019m solving. The only problem with this approach is that Bruce Haight (also known as Mr. Grid Art) has already come up so many of the great grid-art designs! A dog? Nope, Bruce did that last February. A school of fish? Nope, he did that one in August 2014. Lightning bolts? Nope, those were part of his and Peter Collins\u2019s kite puzzle from March 2014. Anyway, I was so frustrated that I couldn\u2019t come up with a new grid art idea that I decided to make an \u201canti-grid art\u201d puzzle! What could be more anti-grid art than a good old square grid?Once I started thinking about square things, my mind jumped to Wyoming, which has always looked so boxy to me on the map! If I could somehow build a puzzle about Wyoming, having a standard 15 x 15 grid could be a cool bonus. Fast forward several hours. By some ginormous stroke of luck, I noticed that four of the most famous landmarks in Wyoming all have the same letter count! So I whipped up a fill and sat down to write the clues. Once the excitement wore off, though, I realized that my theme was kind of boring \u2014 who cares about four landmarks in Wyoming anyway? That\u2019s when inspiration struck again. Since all the landmarks were the same length, why not arrange them in their geographically correct positions? A quick look at Google Maps showed me that I was even luckier than I\u2019d thought: The four landmarks I\u2019d picked were all in different parts of the state! So I scrapped my original grid and built the version you see today.I hope you enjoy!Your thoughts?Advertisement"}

The less he drives, the more he potentially makes.Registering his vehicle on the peer-to-peer car rental company Getaround, Mr. Rogers, who lives in San Francisco, rents out his Toyota Prius by the hour or the day, whenever he does not need it. In the last six months, he has earned an average of $750 a month for essentially doing nothing but acting as his own rent-a-car company.\u201cMy friends and family back in Texas think I\u2019m crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been really surprised by how much money I\u2019ve made.\u2019\u2019Mr. Rogers, whose day job also involves disruptive transportation technology, is an account operations manager for Lyft, the ride-hailing competitor to Uber.Getaround joins companies like Lyft and Uber \u2014 and for that matter, Airbnb \u2014 that enable owners and customers to make use of valuable assets that might otherwise sit idle much of the time.And it is but one example of how smartphone-based technology continues to upend the traditional car rental business, which was long dominated by Avis, Enterprise, Hertz and their various subsidiaries.The conventional car rental companies, which a decade ago had to respond to the rise of digital fleet-rental alternatives like Zipcar \u2014 which Avis ended up buying \u2014 have had little choice but to continue evolving to adapt to smartphone upstarts like Getaround.\u201cFor us, technology is key,\u201d said Sam Zaid, Getaround\u2019s chief executive. \u201cOur technology makes car rental as easy as owning a car.\u201dOperating in 10 cities in the United States, Getaround has signed up about 3,000 car owners. Each owner agrees to let Getaround install a small box under the car\u2019s dashboard, which tracks vehicle diagnostics, pinpoints the car\u2019s location at any moment and keeps track of how the vehicle is being driven. Getaround charges owners $20 a month, and a 40 percent commission on rental fees.To rent a car, which costs $5 to $25 an hour depending on the model, a customer uses the Getaround app to find a nearby vehicle. A grid shows its location and whether and when the car is available. The customer can unlock the vehicle by smartphone, then find a car key that has been hidden within the vehicle.All rental forms are filled out electronically, with no need for the owner and customer to ever meet. The rental rate includes $1 million of insurance coverage, as well as roadside assistance.The Getaround model is meant for cities with concentrated populations, which is why its initial markets also include Portland, Ore., Chicago and Washington.For less densely settled, sprawling metropolises like Los Angeles, there are companies like Skurt, a one-year-old start-up, which will deliver rental cars to customers. After the drop-off, Skurt drivers head back to the office by public transportation, a folding bike or even a skateboard.Like Getaround, Skurt does not own the cars. The company contracts with the major rental companies to make use of their excess capacity. Using the Skurt app, customers choose the models they want, set the drop-off and pickup times and locations, and scan their driver\u2019s licenses. Prices start at about $40 a day.Skurt is aiming at the millennial market. And so, unlike traditional car rental companies, which usually add a surcharge for renters younger than 25, Skurt will rent to drivers as young as 21 at no additional charge.\u201cOur customers don\u2019t consider us as an alternative to car rental companies; they use us as a replacement for car ownership,\u201d said Josh Mangel, 23, one of Skurt\u2019s founders.Skurt\u2019s cars are available in the more heavily populated parts of Los Angeles and neighboring Orange County, with expansion planned soon to San Diego and Austin, Tex.Besides the considerable costs involved in big fleets of vehicles and large chains of airport and storefront retail offices, the conventional rental car companies are also encumbered by longstanding business procedures, which for customers can mean standing in a slow-moving line at a rental agency waiting for a paper rental contract to be issued.That is one reason that earlier this year, Hertz invested in customer convenience by taking a stake in Luxe, a San Francisco start-up that operates as a valet on demand, parking a car when the customer cannot find a space and then handing it back over again when the customer is ready. Although Luxe will park anyone\u2019s car, Hertz plans to make it a service option with some of its rental fleet.To make its valet service feasible, Luxe operates only in parts of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Los Angeles, San Francisco and several other cities. The company returns a car within 30 minutes of the customer\u2019s requesting it.Hertz plans to enhance Luxe\u2019s convenience by having employees pick up and deliver cars for customers who rent away from an airport, wherever they are.\u201cWe\u2019re on the precipice of very significant changes within the company,\u201d said Jeffrey Foland, a Hertz senior executive vice president. Over the next two years, the company will refresh its core technology, including its customer interface and reservations systems. \u201cWe want to make the rental process no more complicated than a couple of clicks on a mobile device.\u201dEnterprise, which also owns the Alamo and National brands, is betting that the best way to reduce the stress of a rental is keeping the customer away from the rental counter. It already operates Enterprise CarShare, a service similar to Zipcar.And now, using Enterprise\u2019s new LaunchPad software, available in 17 North American cities, a customer who has booked a reservation is greeted at the rental agency door by an employee holding a tablet. With LaunchPad, the Enterprise employee has real-time access to the locations of cars in the fleet. The employee uses a prefilled reservation and takes the customer directly to the car.During the car\u2019s inspection, any dings are photographed on the tablet through LaunchPad. When the vehicle is returned, the process is reversed, with a receipt emailed to the renter.\u201cWe\u2019re moving the process from a transaction to an interaction,\u201d said Scott Stephens, an Enterprise assistant vice president.Avis is taking a different approach. With its new Avis Now app, the company\u2019s preferred customers receive automatic notification of the location of their rental vehicle and a picture of it upon reaching the rental lot.Customers can use Avis Now to change cars while still in the lot, confirm fuel level and mileage and return the car without assistance. With Avis vehicles that have connected technology, the app also allows the renter to open the doors and flash the lights to make the car easier to find.Yet none of these advancements address the one basic fact about renting a car: Like borrowed evening wear, it may fit, but it is still not as comfortable as your own.Imagine one day jumping into your rental vehicle and finding your favorite radio stations, seat position and temperature all preconfigured, based on your digital profile. That is a goal that the rental companies say they are pursuing.\u201cThere\u2019s an aligned interest between the car manufacturers, Google, Apple and us,\u201d Mr. Foland of Hertz said. \u201cWe\u2019re working with these parties to have customized vehicles in the near future.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "States Vie to Shield the Wealth of the 1 Percent", "Date": "2016-08-08", "News": "Supported by\u201cI have had a Google news alert on that for a couple years,\u201d Mr. Oshins said as he discussed the case from his office in a squat pink complex about a 20-minute drive from the Las Vegas Strip. What animates Mr. Oshins is not the juicy marital feud, but the legal arcana governing a trust in Delaware where the Kloiber family parked assets worth hundreds of million of dollars, sheltered from estate taxes.Although most out-of-town visitors are drawn to the city\u2019s roulette wheels and slot machines, Mr. Oshins and a battalion of tax lawyers, accountants, advisers, trust administrators and bankers cater to an elite clientele that insists on a much more reliable way to build a fortune.With their backing, Nevada has stoked an aggressive rivalry among a smattering of states to babysit the wealth of the nation\u2019s top 1 percent, pressing public officials to pass laws, streamline regulations, lower fees and replace D.M.V.-level service with concierge treatment.Yet even as more and more states seek ways to help the richest Americans protect their wealth from creditors, divorcing spouses and children, as well as some federal and state tax collectors, critics worry that the effort to attract the lucrative trust business is turning into a competitive game of giveaway.\u201cThere is no doubt that many, many jurisdictions are committed to being at the bottom,\u201d said Edward McCaffrey, a professor at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law. \u201cI think the real question now is: \u2018Where is the bottom?\u2019\u201dThe federal government leaves it to each state to draw up its own trust laws, and several have tried to go as far as they can without inciting accusations that they are abetting tax evasion or hiding assets, he said. But in pushing the envelope, they can also run into challenges from courts in other states, including the Kloibers\u2019 home of Kentucky, that have different statutes governing trusts.Still, Nevada \u201cis definitely the most aggressive in my experience in terms of asset protection,\u201d Mr. McCaffrey said.Starting with the absence of any state income tax and resilient secrecy protections, Nevada has added a passel of laws and regulations intended to lure trust business. Individuals who establish so-called irrevocable trusts have more flexibility to transfer assets to a new trust with more favorable terms. Creditors are blocked from access to money held in trusts (making the arrangement also popular among doctors, who worry a malpractice case could bankrupt them). And what are known as dynasty trusts allow the wealthy to pass their fortunes from generation to generation for hundreds of years without paying estate taxes.Defenders of the industry won what was characterized as a \u201cdo or die\u201d battle in 2013, fending off legislation that would have opened up Nevada trusts to future claims from spouses and domestic partners for property settlements, alimony or child support. And Nevada has only a narrow two-year window for creditors to make a claim against a trust\u2019s assets.\u201cIt\u2019s against the law in this state to conceal assets from legitimate creditors,\u201d said Mark A. Hutchison, Nevada\u2019s Republican lieutenant governor, a lawyer himself.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to be aware of phantom threats that could blow up our industry,\u201d he added.Phantom threats, he said, include recent suspicions \u2014 after the leak of the Panama Papers \u2014 that citizens and foreigners are illegally hiding assets in the state.If the revelations were a source of embarrassment, however, they were also a source of free worldwide publicity. \u201cIt\u2019s actually helped us, believe it or not,\u201d said Greg Crawford, president of the Alliance Trust Company in Reno, explaining that Nevada was not as well known internationally for its asset-protection policies as Delaware. \u201cI\u2019ve had more calls from people overseas, established families, who are interested in Nevada.\u201dMr. Crawford disputed the idea that the state\u2019s rules were abetting criminal activities. \u201cThe honest, ethical taxpaying people around the world who simply want privacy are happy to put assets in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cCrooks know they can be confiscated, so it actually serves as a weeding-out process.\u201dMonitoring development in other states and bulking up asset protection laws, said Mr. Hutchison, the lieutenant governor, has dependable bipartisan support. \u201cThe trust business is a big business,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve always viewed it as a way to stimulate the economy.\u201dAlthough trusts generate little public revenue or direct investment in the state, they do provide a steady stream of work for those in the industry. Supporters also say they generate indirect investment by drawing wealthy people who spend money and might invest later on.Robert H. Sitkoff, a Harvard Law School professor, said that in smaller-population states like Delaware, Nevada, South Dakota and Alaska, trust and estate lawyers \u201care an effective and important lobby in a way that would be much harder to replicate in a place like New York, a big state with lots going on.\u201dWith the competition so intense, each state tries to exploit marginal advantages and highlight rivals\u2019 weaknesses.The marketing pitch is not always about keeping up with the neighbors, however. Even as Nevada and Delaware blocked ex-spouses with claims for child support, for example, New Hampshire decided not to follow suit.\u201cWe have reviewed that and said that\u2019s not our policy,\u2019\u201d said William F. J. Ardinger, a lawyer at Rath, Young & Pignatelli who has lobbied for changes in New Hampshire\u2019s trust laws.His state is making a different kind of appeal. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of wealth on the Eastern Seaboard, and New Hampshire fares well in the mind of those families,\u201d Mr. Ardinger said. \u201cThey\u2019ll say, \u2018I went to prep school at Exeter,\u2019 or, \u2018I went to Camp Winaukee as a kid.\u2019\u201cReno is a beautiful place, but it\u2019s not \u2018On Golden Pond.\u2019\u201dThe Las Vegas lawyer Mr. Oshins, who almost makes the Kardashians look shy, is unfazed by such comparisons.\u201cNew Hampshire is a little bit of a wannabe,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re a second-tier state.\u201dFollow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}

(Duh.)Warner is known for its leave-no-billboard-unplastered marketing campaigns, and the long push behind \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d was no exception.And, of course, there was extensive digital marketing, including at least five efforts with Snapchat.Warner landed a one-two punch in March by setting up a tattoo parlor at the South by Southwest film, music and interactive media festival. The shop, ostensibly the handiwork of Harley Quinn, a tattooed \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d character played by Margot Robbie, gave free tattoos themed to the film. As in, permanent ones.

It serves as an affirmation of Emerson\u2019s belief that true learning can\u2019t be done in an intellectual straitjacket.Because of an editing error, an early version of the Wednesday Morning Briefing misstated where the owners of a vegan restaurant chain in California served meat.

{"Headline": "The Innovation Campus: Building Better Ideas", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhere once the campus amenities arms race was waged over luxury dorms and recreation facilities, now colleges and universities are building deluxe structures for the generation of wonderful ideas. They and their partners in industry are pouring millions into new buildings for business, engineering and applied learning that closely resemble the high-tech workplace, itself inspired by the minimally partitioned spaces of the garage and the factory.What architects take from Building 20 is not its ramshackle aesthetic \u2014 though some believe less polish provides more freedom \u2014 but the importance of mixing disciplines, of work performed out in the open, and of transition zones like hallways and staircases as sites for productive run-ins.Though studies have shown that proximity and conversation can produce creative ideas, there\u2019s little research on the designs needed to facilitate the process. Still, there are commonalities.Staircases and halls are wide and often daylit, encouraging people to dwell between their appointments in hopes of having a creative collision. Exposure to natural light itself contributes to improved workplace performance. There\u2019s also much more to do with your hands than take notes in class: The need to move your body, by working on a prototype, taking the stairs or going in search of caffeine at a centralized cafe, is built in, providing breaks to let the mind wander.The rationales for these buildings are varied: Employers are dissatisfied with graduates\u2019 preparation, students are unhappy with outdated teaching methods, and colleges want to attract students whose eyes are on postgrad venture capital and whose scalable ideas might come in handy on campus. And so universities of all sizes, both public (Wichita State, University of Utah, University of Iowa) and private (Cornell, Northwestern, Stanford), have opened or are planning such facilities.The studio is in the Bloomberg Center, named to acknowledge a $100 million gift from Bloomberg Philanthropies, matching New York City\u2019s contribution toward the total cost for phase one, which is estimated at $800 million. A sculptural staircase, jutting provocatively from the side of the building, was designed to encourage students and faculty members to take the stairs to their work space instead of the shorter elevator route between front door and desk. So much of contemporary design for innovation involves adding friction to people\u2019s work lives, as unexpected encounters (with people, with different spaces, with art) are supposed to lead to unexpected ideas.\u201cBeing in bigger interactive spaces encourages expansive thinking, while being in a box of a room encourages box thinking,\u201d said Dan Huttenlocher, founding dean and vice provost at Cornell Tech. \u201cSometimes you need to be in a box to concentrate, but to always sit in a little box is a problem.\u201dNo one has a private office at the Bloomberg Center, the primary academic building, and opaque walls are few. The only spaces faculty members can truly call their own are lockable storage cabinets, with carts for equipment. Traditional classrooms, too, are few \u2014 the Cornell Tech curriculum privileges projects over lectures. Instead, there will be options so that people can choose how they like to work, from open-plan spaces by the windows, to a roof deck with a garden, to huddle rooms for groups of five or less.\u201cAs you begin to understand how people work together, there is an ideal size of collaboration,\u201d said Ung-Joo Scott Lee, principal at Morphosis, the architects. \u201cBeyond five people it is too much of a crowd.\u201dIf this sounds like Silicon Valley, it should. \u201cWe looked at Pixar in Emeryville very carefully, along with Bloomberg L.P. and Google, who have sizable office space in New York and understand the constraints of the urban environment,\u201d Mr. Huttenlocher said. (Until it moves onto its own campus, Cornell Tech is headquartered in the Google building in Chelsea \u2014 every designer working for a university, it seems, has taken a swing through Mountain View.)\u201cPixar had to bring together very different cultures and get them to work as one, the creative and the business side, but also creative and tech people,\u201d Mr. Huttenlocher said.to this live-work building, anticipating the early lifestyle of dot-com employees, whose living quarters usually resemble walk-in closets. The Utah version is more plush, however: Residents, who can be graduate or undergraduate and in any major, can choose pods (cubbylike rooms with built-in bed, desk, storage and TV), lofts in an industrial vernacular (beds in a communal setting with shared kitchen, lounge and bathrooms) or more traditional single or double rooms.Different floors have different themes, based on Utah\u2019s existing strengths: one for games and digital media, one for adventure and gear, one for design and the arts, one for global impact and sustainability. The ground-floor \u201cgarage\u201d has workshops equipped with 3-D printers, laser cutters and other prototyping tools, available to anyone at the university and staffed by work-study students. All the programs offered by the Lassonde Entrepreneurship Institute, the division that is building the studios, are extracurricular and interdisciplinary; a few degrees are offered in partnership with the business school.\u201cOne thing about the building is it has no formal classrooms, and no faculty or staff offices,\u201d said Troy D\u2019Ambrosio, executive director of the institute. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to have a classroom because that says, \u2018In this room you learn, out here you don\u2019t learn.\u2019\u201dInnovation buildings tend to be affiliated with schools of business or engineering, but there is a strong arts presence within them. Lassonde Studios, designed by Yazdani Studio of Cannon Design, hopes to attract students from industrial design, the fine arts and communications. \u201cWe have made an effort to say, \u2018Entrepreneurs create new things, and you do that too,\u2019\u201d Mr. D\u2019Ambrosio said.A thousand students applied for the 400 beds this fall, and 37 percent of the chosen are women. \u201cIt\u2019s important to have a critical mass of women involved so women will come in,\u201d he said. \u201cEngineering is very heavily male, the business school is more male than female, but we are getting applicants from the fine arts, humanities and health sciences. Students have 35 to 40 different majors, and that happened pretty organically.\u201dThe studios are named after a Canadian businessman, Pierre Lassonde, who gave the initial $7 million for the building (he and his late wife, Claudette MacKay-Lassonde, are Utah alumni). The bulk of the $45 million construction costs were funded by a revenue bond, to be paid back with \u201crents\u201d from students. The experience will cost. A double goes for $6,830 for the academic year, a three-person loft for $9,135. Elsewhere on campus: $4,874 for a double, $4,367 for a triple deluxe.The radical restructuring of both curriculum and architecture are supposed to contribute to greater parity. Gone is a first year of large lecture courses on basic science. Instead, students work alone or in small groups on a \u201cpassion project.\u201d \u201cIf you are working on an efficient filtering system for water in Ethiopia, you will need to know more about mathematics, about partial differential equations,\u201d Dr. Kozinski said. \u201cThey would come to us, and then we would gently start introducing mathematics. Learning by doing and learning in social spaces with professors is reflected in the design.\u201dInformal lounges are threaded throughout the building, from a generous one at entry level to small banquettes in the wide hallways. Active learning classrooms (there are no lecture halls) combine different sizes and heights of tables and chairs, and are equipped with projectors and I.T.-integrated furniture from Steelcase. The \u201cSandbox\u201d space, which includes collaboration-size rooms and a 3-D prototyping lab, gives students the option to brainstorm on their own or work with classmates. The architects specified some furniture with built-in scribble pads, and many of the walls are writable back-painted glass.\u201cWe equate it to a design lab like in architecture school, a place where you can go brainstorm, sketch on the scribble pads, work with classmates,\u201d Paul Stevens, a senior principal at ZAS, said. \u201cOr you can take your sketches and use hand tools to start making a sample.\u201d Tool cribs hold smaller materials for experiential learning. Larger, purpose-built labs are equipped with professional-grade equipment for testing and prototyping, including a concrete-lined mechanical lab with a 12-ton crane. \u201cThis is where you get to build things like solar cars, or crush concrete,\u201d he said.Once students have their model, they can pitch it to industry leaders in a dressed-up lounge intended as a bridge space between students and the wider world. It was important, Mr. Stevens said, that it resemble a corporate lounge \u2014 \u201ca beautiful, high-end-finish space\u201d \u2014 rather than an intimidating board room, and the school made it a priority to have best-in-class furniture, including Eames chairs, to set the tone.The Garage provides cafe, meeting, classroom and workshop space for anyone on campus \u2014 a student center with an entrepreneurial purpose, with amenities like 3-D printers, Bluescape interactive screens and design software. Programs focus on helping students develop ideas and finding them mentors. Melissa Crounse, the executive director of the Garage and a former Google employee, holds weekly dinners for alumni and students, asking the successful (one assumes) alumni to tell a story about a previous failure.Gensler began the design process by diagraming the paths of potential users, from visiting entrepreneurs giving a lecture to a student prototyping a project through sewing, 3-D printing or laser cutting. By overlaying those paths they saw \u201chot spots\u201d where students, faculty members and guests might naturally congregate, like areas around whiteboards on conference room doors.\u201cIf you keep the schedule on the outside of the conference room, the act of signing up in an analog way causes a lot of discussions,\u201d Mr. Heiser said. \u201cMaybe meetings tie together. You need to create experiences that heighten the potential interaction.\u201dArt schools have always had open plans, daylit work spaces and power tools. But the new arts building also has many elements of the STEM-focused innovation campus in hopes of facilitating the mixing of disciplines and modes of instruction.Iowa\u2019s building attempts to embody that idea by placing itself along a primary pedestrian route, so seeing new work is unavoidable. The curriculum, too, draws in majors from across the university, with popular classes that include building your own bicycle.\u201cEngineering majors are often impressed by art students\u2019 relative high level of tool knowledge,\u201d Mr. McGuire said. \u201cThey see their experiences in various studios, from the suite of CNC equipment to traditional fabrication, complementing and enhancing theoretical knowledge they\u2019ve learned in engineering courses.\u201dSet near the university\u2019s museums, the building, like Iowa\u2019s, is positioned as a campus crossroad. People from other disciplines may literally be stopped in their tracks by what\u2019s going on in the transparent ground-floor galleries and workshops, or be drawn inside by a glimpse of people studying in the treehouselike reading room.Here, classes that combine art and science and art and technology include \u201cDrawing With Code\u201d and, most appropriately, \u201cData as Material,\u201d which delves into the history of using information to create art.\u201cWe reached out to the local business community and asked what they wanted in a graduate, and they told us there was a two-year gap between a graduate and someone who is a productive worker,\u201d said Emily Patterson, associate director of facilities planning at Wichita State. \u201cThey were asking for a more prepared student.\u201dSo in the $25 million Experiential Engineering Building, set to open for classes in January, students will be able to do hands-on and applied learning in 25 specialized science and engineering labs; engineering hub rooms will be open 24/7. A separate makerspace with evening hours, run by GoCreate, will offer facilities for metalworking, woodworking, textiles and digital creation to students and local residents. Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, a software company, is planning a 3-D immersive lab, and a few other spaces have been set aside for local businesses.Today\u2019s innovation campuses tend to make their pipeline to the real world explicit. Airbus Americas is moving its engineering center, and 400 Wichita employees, to a new structure on the campus, to be built on ground leased from the university. The center will also have room for up to 100 student workers. In another partnership, a law enforcement training center, with construction costs paid by the city and county, will serve the police departments as well as Wichita State\u2019s criminal justice students.Kansas public education has experienced state cutbacks at every level in recent months. Wichita State, along with other Kansas universities, has increased tuition 5 percent to make up for the budget cuts. \u201cState funding is dwindling, so we have to be innovative in our financing,\u201d Ms. Patterson said. Construction has gone forward on the Innovation Campus because the Experiential Engineering Building, designed by Perkins + Will and WDM Architects, is financed via grants to Kansas universities to produce more engineering graduates in a state where aviation and energy are top industries.How successful will Wichita State and other universities be at fueling innovation and, ultimately, a new entrepreneurship economy? The proof may be many years out, and difficult to quantify. But the pressure on administrators to change their campuses may soon come, not just from above and within, but from below.An anecdote from Kevin B. Sullivan of Payette, whose firm has interdisciplinary science and engineering centers under construction at Northeastern and Tufts, underscores the urgency. \u201cI\u2019m on the board of my daughter\u2019s high school, and what they are doing there is taking the existing library, gutting it and turning it into a tech-enablement space,\u201d he said. \u201cThe college process may be dumbed down from what they do in high school.\u201dAlexandra Lange is the architecture critic for Curbed and the author of \u201cWriting About Architecture: Mastering the Language of Buildings and Cities.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Teju Cole\u2019s Essays Build Connections Between African and Western Art", "Date": "2016-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.In \u201cThe Anxiety of Influence,\u201d the renowned critic Harold Bloom argued that poets, especially those in the Western tradition since the Renaissance, necessarily negotiate the work of their predecessors as they write. \u201cThe precursors flood us,\u201d Bloom wrote, \u201cand our imaginations can die by drowning in them, but no imaginative life is possible if such inundation is wholly evaded.\u201d Cole shares Bloom\u2019s interest in the fraught and burdened relationship writers and artists have to our ancestors, and he seeks to answer yet another question: How does the imagination cross and recross racial and filial boundaries, and what does this crossing mean? With our ever-enlarging global access to the visions and voices and influences of others, Cole attempts to untangle the knot of who or what belongs to us and to whom or what do we belong as artists, thinkers and, finally, human beings.In this light, \u201cBlack Body,\u201d the opening essay in \u201cKnown and Strange Things,\u201d engages the \u201cquestion of filiation\u201d that tormented James Baldwin in his essay \u201cStranger in the Village.\u201d Baldwin, reflecting on his stay in the white-peopled Swiss village of Leukerbad, was moved to write that \u201cthe most illiterate among them is related, in a way I am not, to Dante, Shakespeare, Michelangelo. .\u2008.\u2008. Out of their hymns and dances come Beethoven and Bach. Go back a few centuries and they are in their full glory \u2014 but I am in Africa, watching the conquerors arrive.\u201dCole, revisiting the terrain of Leukerbad, pairs himself with Baldwin (also echoing, in his parenthesis, the poet Elizabeth Bishop\u2019s \u201cOne Art\u201d): \u201cI am black like him; and I am slender; and have a gap in my front teeth and am not especially tall (no, write it: short) .\u2008.\u2008. and feel myself in all places, from New York City to rural Switzerland, the custodian of a black body, and have to find the language for all of what that means to me and to the people who look at me. The ancestor had briefly taken possession of the descendant.\u201dBut Cole soon distances himself from Baldwin\u2019s feeling of alienation. He states that Baldwin\u2019s \u201cself-abnegation\u201d prevents him from embracing Bach or Rembrandt, who Cole insists do not belong to one race. He might even care more about these artists \u201cthan some white people do,\u201d Cole writes.The first section of the collection, \u201cReading Things,\u201d has Cole claiming filiation with a number of authors (all male) who prove important to him. In the case of many of them, influence begets influence. Along with Baldwin comes V.S. Naipaul (\u201cThe benevolent rheumy-eyed old soul: so fond of the word \u2018nigger,\u2019 so aggressive in his lack of sympathy toward Africa, so brutal in his treatment of woman\u201d); Tomas Transtromer (\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I\u2019m unembarrassable about influence, because I realize now how many of Transtromer\u2019s concepts I have hidden away in my own work\u201d); W.G. Sebald (\u201cThis expert mixing of forms owed a great deal to his reading of the 17th-\u00adcentury melancholics Robert Burton and Thomas Browne\u201d); Derek Walcott (\u201cHe names painters as his exemplars more often than he names poets: Pissarro, Veronese, C\u00e9zanne, Manet, Gauguin and Millet roll through the \u00adpages\u201d); and Andr\u00e9 Aciman (\u201cAciman\u2019s debt to Proust is deep and freely acknowledged\u201d).This opening section concludes with \u201cA Conversation With Aleksandar Hemon,\u201d in which Hemon \u2014 a writer and critic and self-identified \u201cdiasporic person\u201d \u2014 questions Cole on what Nigerian history means to him. Cole\u2019s answer catapults him into a global context: \u201cMy identity maps onto other things: being a Lagosian (Lagos is like a city-state), being a West African, being African, being a part of the Black Atlantic. I identify strongly with the historical network that connects New York, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro and Lagos.\u201d Hemon is also interested in what happens when influences are constantly shaping and reshaping the imagination. For Cole, visual artists, especially painters, are least affected by that anxiety of influence and \u201cknow that everything is a combination of what\u2019s observed, what\u2019s imagined, what\u2019s overheard and what\u2019s been done before.\u201d He argues that to acknowledge influence is to let go of notions of \u201cliteral records of reality\u201d and cultural or racial ownership of content. All Cole wants is to be \u201cdragged down into a space of narrative that I haven\u2019t been in before.\u201dThe stunning second section, \u201cSeeing Things,\u201d is especially captivating and reveals Cole\u2019s voracious appetite for and love of the visual. Taken together, the essays in this section provide a comprehensive look at contemporary photography, placed within a historical framework. This approach brings forward evidence of things unseen, things, as Susan Sontag put it, \u201cleast likely to be known.\u201d The artists who have Cole\u2019s attention impose their individual and subjective sense on the material of the world, rejecting the notion, as most photographers do by nature, that it is possible to capture objective \u201crecords of reality.\u201d He is drawn toward filmmakers and the visual artists who see with this photographer\u2019s orientation. The collage work of Wangechi Mutu, described as \u201cboth easy and difficult to look at, seductive in their patterning, grotesque in their themes,\u201d relies on actual photographic images; Cole\u2019s favorite films by Michael Haneke and Krzysztof Kieslowski bring into view images of life so ordinary they could escape our attention. Cole believes that all of this work allows us to think with the eyes, and though the Australian composer Peter Sculthrope is also included here, his music becomes a passageway into the landscape and history of Australia.But it\u2019s the essays that focus explicitly on photography, especially, that demand our attention. Cole considers here the work of both well and lesser known photographers such as Seydou Keita, Malick Sidibe, J.D. \u2019Okhai Ojeikere, Joseph Moise Agbodjelou, Zanele Muholi, Henri \u00adCartier-Bresson, Sergei Ilnitsky, Sam Abell, Glenna Gordan, Saul Leiter, Richard Renaldi, Thomas Demand, as well as Google-based photographic and filmic practitioners like Doug Rickard, Mishka Henner, Aaron Hobson, Michael Wolf and Dina Kelberman. These photographers, whether reframing \u201canthropological images of \u2018natives\u2019 made by Europeans in the late 19th and early 20th centuries\u201d or applying a curatorial eye to the world around us, are democratizing the history of photography.When the occasional essay fails to hold interest it\u2019s because the connections Cole draws to some European lineage remain tenuous. This is the case, for example, with Cole\u2019s meditation on death through the woodcuts entitled \u201cPictures of Death,\u201d by Hans Holbein the Younger, which brings him to the killing of the African-\u00adAmerican Walter Scott by a South Carolina police officer in 2015, which in turn makes him think about the writer Sir Walter Scott and one of his short stories, about a premeditated murder, \u201cThe Two Drovers.\u201d This associative style enables Cole to move across disciplines and through time, but in this case seems tendentious.In the third section, \u201cBeing There,\u201d photography\u2019s ability as a discipline to present a unique archive of reality comes most clearly into light. These essays track Cole\u2019s journeys around an explosive world of drones, wars and diseases, including the kidnappings of young girls in Chibok and assassinations of terror suspects by drone warfare. Cole happens to be streets away when the poet Kofi Awoonor is killed in a terrorist massacre in a Nairobi mall. He finds in Awoonor\u2019s work some echoes of T.S. Eliot, but Cole ends his essay with a line from Awoonor, himself quoting \u201can ancient poet from my tradition\u201d: \u201cI will say it before death comes. And if I don\u2019t say it, let no one say it for me. I will be the one who will say it.\u201d Even as Cole positions Awoonor relative to the European tradition, he also allows Awoonor to have the last word.One of the most resonant and powerful essays in \u201cBeing There\u201d is \u201cThe White Savior Industrial Complex,\u201d an expansion of Cole\u2019s seven-part-Twitter-feed response to \u201cKony 2012,\u201d a video calling for the arrest of the Ugandan rebel leader Joseph Kony. He meditates more fully here on the interconnectivity of American political polices to their outcome. Activist philanthropy that begins in amnesia lacks, in Cole\u2019s words, \u201cconstellational thinking.\u201d He lays bear the relationship among sentimentality, ignorance, corruption, pillage and complicity within our global communities. Under Cole\u2019s watchful eye the world shrinks into a network of countries, communities and individuals influenced by, dependent on and affected by other countries, communities and individuals.This brilliant collection closes with an epilogue, \u201cBlind Spot,\u201d in which Cole recounts the time he first had an episode of papillophlebitis, or \u201cbig blind spot syndrome.\u201d If epilogues benefit from hindsight, it\u2019s difficult not to feel the piece is intended by Cole to be read diagnostically, beyond its autobiographical content. In the essay, Cole admits to feeling shame as he worries that a waitress in a Hudson, N.Y., cafe he stumbles into might not interpret his inability to read a menu as eye trouble but assume instead that he was \u201cilliterate.\u201d This use of the word \u201cilliterate\u201d is an echo of the James Baldwin quotation in the first essay in the collection, \u201cBlack Body.\u201d Suddenly the essays endeavoring to connect and build lines of influence between the canon of Western and African literature and art tremble as they stand in relation to the strange and surprising feeling of being misread. How quickly the black body can be thrown out of its cosmopolitanism and literacy, as the author\u2019s own anxieties overtake him sitting at a counter in that cafe next to \u201ctwo blond women and two men, also fair haired.\u201dCole\u2019s global perspective hits its limit here. History \u2014 literary, political, social or personal \u2014 offers us a vast archive of knowledge that both influences and challenges the definitions we construct for ourselves. On every level of engagement and critique, \u201cKnown and Strange Things\u201d is an essential and scintillating journey.Claudia Rankine is the Iseman professor of poetry at Yale.

The headlines have been withering: \u201cHerbalife Settles Pyramid Scheme Case With Regulator, in Blow to Pershing\u2019s Ackman,\u201d Reuters wrote. \u201cHerbalife Scores Huge Victory in Its Bill Ackman Battle With F.T.C. Settlement,\u201d Forbes said. And on and on.And yet there\u2019s something grossly wrong with this assessment.Yes, Mr. Ackman has lost a ton of money for his investors on his bet against Herbalife. But with the F.T.C. settlement, he has won a moral victory that could very well help hundreds of thousands of Herbalife\u2019s defrauded customers, who are mainly low-income immigrants who would most likely not have had any legal recourse had Mr. Ackman not loudly called the company into question.Herbalife, she said, was responsible for \u201cdeceiving hundreds of thousands of hopeful people.\u201d She described \u201cthe dream portrayed by Herbalife\u201d as an illusion. She went on to say that \u201cthe vast majority of Herbalife distributors found they could make little or no money selling Herbalife products.\u201dWorse still, Ms. Ramirez said, her agency had determined that \u201cpeople who leased space and opened a nutrition club and worked long hours made no money or lost money.\u201d And, she concluded: \u201cThe small minority of Herbalife distributors who did make a lot of money were paid by Herbalife not for selling the company\u2019s products, but for buying the products themselves and then successfully recruiting large networks of others to do the same.\u201dIn other words, she described pretty much exactly what Mr. Ackman has been saying for the last three years.According to Mr. Ackman in 2014, \u201cThese people work really hard, and unfortunately, they don\u2019t realize that they\u2019ve been defrauded.\u201dMr. Ackman specializes in making big, concentrated bets. Sometimes his investments score big, but that\u2019s not always the case. Here\u2019s how some of his ideas have fared.And here we are today, and they were true.\u201cIf it were not for Bill, I don\u2019t think the F.T.C. would have launched an investigation,\u201d Mr. Braun, the director, said. \u201cBill is unquestionably the catalyst.\u201dHerbalife refused to participate in the film, though Mr. Braun said he met and spoke privately with Herbalife\u2019s chief executive, Michael O. Johnson, for several hours.The website also noted that the producer of \u201cBetting on Zero\u201d and Bill Ackman were on the same crew team in college. According to Mr. Braun, one of the producers, Devin Adair, \u201coverlapped\u201d with Mr. Ackman at Harvard, but said that they were not friends and hadn\u2019t talked in decades. Ms. Adair was the coxswain for one of the crew boats; Mr. Ackman rowed on a different boat.The battle has been portrayed as either a pitched fight between a narcissistic, know-it-all investor seeking to bankrupt a company for profit (that\u2019s Herbalife\u2019s view) or as a crusading moralist trying to right a wrong. It may be a combination of both.\u201cThis is an \u2018Emperor Wears No Clothes\u2019 story,\u201d Mr. Braun said, explaining that the charm of that fairy tale \u201cis it\u2019s told by the sweet little boy.\u201d The message, he noted, is harder to accept when \u201cthe messenger is a tough hedge fund manager.\u201dAnd while there have long been moral questions about the very concept of \u201cshorting\u201d \u2014 betting against a company\u2019s stock \u2014 it is hard not to look at this particular situation as an example of an investor acting as a check on the market.Admittedly, there were questions about Mr. Ackman\u2019s tactics. He spent more than $50 million on his campaign, lobbying regulators and members of Congress to look into Herbalife\u2019s practices. But if Mr. Ackman didn\u2019t do it, who would? Complaints about Herbalife have been made for years, but it wasn\u2019t until Mr. Ackman very loudly got involved that the government stepped in.There are those who worry that Mr. Ackman\u2019s involvement in Herbalife means the oligarchs have taken over \u2014 that billionaires have become de facto regulators. It is a valid concern. And the billionaires may not always be on the right side. (Mr. Ackman has been involved in some investments, like Valeant Pharmaceuticals and J. C. Penney, that didn\u2019t go his way.)But, in this instance, he won a victory that will have real benefits for many people.And yet on Wall Street, his victory is considered hollow because he has so far lost money on his bet against Herbalife.\u201cTruth, candor and transparency are at odds with the measuring stick that Wall Street applies,\u201d Mr. Braun said.For now, Herbalife is heralding the settlement as a victory that will allow it to move on with its business. But Mr. Braun says that if the company genuinely changes its business model to conform with the settlement, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine a way for them to be profitable.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think this is over,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Start-Up Turns to Saffron to Help Afghanistan Regrow", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBomb-blasted roads, frequent blackouts, shortages of basic equipment and an untested consumer market are hardly conditions that make for natural entrepreneurial opportunities.Their business is part of a small crop of efforts to help develop Afghanistan\u2019s resource economy.\u201cWe wanted to create something to empower everyday Afghans long after we left,\u201d said Kimberly Jung, one of Rumi Spice\u2019s founders, who said the company\u2019s name was inspired by the 13th-century Persian poet.Saffron is one of the most expensive spices in the world, costing $2,500 to $30,000 a kilogram. A staple in Indian, Moroccan and Persian cuisine, it is also a crucial ingredient in European dishes like Spanish paella and French bouillabaisse.As Americans search out the latest artisanal trends, Afghan saffron is starting to make inroads.The Rumi Spice founders decided to focus on farmers because 80 percent of the Afghan population works in agriculture, according to the United States Embassy in Kabul.Still, starting a business, even a small one, is filled with challenges in Afghanistan. Much business is done based on trust or relationships rather than contracts or agreements. In their case, the founders discovered that some of the contacts they made during their military deployments were receptive to working with them.In addition, electricity blackouts are common, which can render the dryers used in processing useless. The main national highway is both damaged by war and still a prime target of improvised explosive devices, or I.E.D.s, making travel risky.Saffron is expensive because it is difficult to grow and painstaking to harvest. Each amethyst-colored saffron crocus produces just three stigmas. The stigmas are separated by hand from the blossom and then dried into rusty-red threads.About 150 flowers are needed to produce a single gram of saffron. Afghan saffron has a reputation for being particularly flavorful \u2014 in part because of the terrain and harsh climate around Herat, where it is grown.In 2014, Keith Alaniz, an Army engineer officer who worked with regional governments in Afghanistan, approached his friend Ms. Jung, whom he had met while working for the Army Corps of Engineers after Hurricane Sandy in New York, about the idea of marketing Afghan saffron.Ms. Jung had been an Army engineer officer who searched for roadside bombs in Afghanistan. She was then at Harvard Business School with Emily Miller, also a former Army engineer officer, who had assisted Special Operations on night raids.The company\u2019s fourth founder, Carol Wang, had worked in Afghanistan on a World Bank-backed rural development program.The farmers were skeptical at first, Ms. Jung said, because they had seen \u201cpeople come and go with many promises.\u201dBut Ms. Miller said, \u201cOnce they started seeing we could really sell the product, the farmers started knocking on our doors.\u201dRumi Spice worked with 34 farmers in 2015. The company plans to work with more than 80 farmers for this year\u2019s harvest in October and November.The processing plant, based in Herat, employed 75 Afghan women in 2015. The company paid their wages directly to them rather than following the more common Afghan practice of paying the male head of the household. About 300 to 400 women will be hired for the 2016 harvest.Rumi Spice was initially set up as a limited liability company. A year later, the founders switched it to a public benefit corporation. They were drawn by the idea that the company would be \u201crequired by law to report profit and impact every two years\u201d to shareholders, Ms. Miller said.In 2016, Rumi Spice is on track to reach its projected revenue of $500,000 for the year. The founders say that it became profitable three months ago.Two of the founders, Ms. Jung and Ms. Miller, are full time and based in the United States, while the other two work with them part time. The company also has two additional full-time employees based in Chicago and Afghanistan.Rumi Spice has hired locals to help provide security for the operations in Afghanistan.Abdul Shakoor Ehrarri, an agricultural specialist, manages the saffron processing plant. He also meets with new farmers and helps recruit female employees by going for tea with their husbands, fathers or brothers to assure them that they will be safe in the workplace.It also helps that Herat, the saffron region where the plant is based, is one of the most stable in Afghanistan.Beyond security, the Rumi Spice team says that another challenge is educating American consumers about saffron. \u201cThe average consumer is very skeptical of anything from Afghanistan,\u201d Ms. Miller said.Chefs, however, have been receptive. Many already used high-quality saffron and were curious to try the Afghan variety.In 2015, soon after Ms. Jung returned from a trip to Afghanistan, she took some saffron to the New York chef Daniel Boulud.\u201cI was very pleased by the high quality and the purity of the pistils of Rumi Spice saffron, and the taste was exceptional as well,\u201d said Mr. Boulud, who has been using Rumi Spice saffron in his signature restaurant, Daniel, for over six months. \u201cIt immediately appealed to us to aid the veterans and help the economy in Afghanistan.\u201dFamilyFarmed has helped Rumi Spice refine its brand. \u201cInitially they were helping Afghan farmers by paying a premium price for saffron and displacing opium production,\u201d said Jim Slama, the president of FamilyFarmed. \u201cWe helped them simplify their story. Now they are an ethical luxury brand.\u201dRumi Spice is also exploring new channels to reach customers, such as meal delivery services. \u201cWe are also looking into super-edgy product development,\u201d Ms. Miller said, such as \u201cpremium saffron butter that could go with a fresh Maine lobster.\u201dBut more than the business aspect, Ms. Jung said that the connection to Afghan people has been the highlight of the venture.She remembers a special moment during the saffron harvest last fall. At one point, the younger women working in the new processing plant, some of them teenagers, shyly asked Ms. Jung to play Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s song \u201cIrreplaceable\u201d on her phone.They shut the door, held an impromptu dance party \u2014 and then returned to the time-consuming task of separating the fiery red stigmas from the purple saffron blossoms.Quoting an Afghan saying, Ms. Jung said, \u201cDrop by drop a river is made.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Giants Gobble Start-Ups in an Antitrust Blind Spot", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorLike Facebook\u2019s acquisition of WhatsApp, the Walmart deal will probably end up being another example of an upstart internet company being swallowed up to preserve the stranglehold of a giant.This happens because antitrust regulators are stuck in an outdated view of the world, while the internet giants are more attuned to their nascent competitive threats. The deal for Jet.com is just the latest defensive internet acquisition of an emerging start-up that will preserve the hegemony of a select few.And now it is being swallowed up by Walmart.This could be seen as a victory for competition. Walmart will now have a more dynamic management and brand to buttress its own internet sales operation, which trails Amazon by quite a distance. This will allow it to better compete against Amazon. The likely result is that competition in online retailing will eventually be a slugfest between Amazon and Walmart with everyone else thrown by the wayside.The problem with this narrative is that it cements the positions of Walmart and Amazon as the only players in town.This is the modus operandi of the big internet behemoths. They live in fear of new technology disrupting their businesses and killing them off.Mr. Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez was a Facebook product manager when the company faced its greatest threat: Google Plus. Facebook won because it enforced an ethos of all work, all the time, spurred by constant fear of extinction.Facebook and its elite brethren will do anything to make sure they are not the next Yahoo or Radio Shack, killed by disruption and failure to innovate. This translates into paying obscene sums for technology that might challenge their dominance one day.If you don\u2019t believe this, there is a poignant passage in \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d where Mr. Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez notes that Mark Zuckerberg saw that there were two companies with \u201chockey stick growth\u201d that matched Facebook\u2019s own: Instagram and WhatsApp. Both were amassing users at an amazing rate and both were an existential threat to Facebook.Did Mr. Zuckerberg rev up the Facebook machine to try to outcompete them? No. Instead, he bought Instagram for about $1 billion and WhatsApp for an astounding $21.8 billion.Today, Facebook is dominant, with more than 1.7 billion monthly active users. WhatsApp has more than 1 billion monthly active users and Instagram, more than 500 million.Another Google example is YouTube, which was bought for $1.65 billion in 2006 and is now a constant stream of users for Google. Indeed, YouTube, with more than one billion active monthly users, is a top driver of Alphabet\u2019s user growth.Billions of dollars are made in Silicon Valley by selling nascent upstarts to the giants. And the dominant players pay eagerly to remain dominant. That is what is going on with the Jet.com acquisition and perhaps even the $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn by Microsoft.Where are the antitrust authorities in all of this? The guiding standard under the law is that no acquisition should be allowed if it would \u201clessen competition.\u201dUnder the traditional view of antitrust, when Facebook, for example, tries to buy a company like Instagram, it can argue that anyone can start such a website. And there are other competitors like Google and Snapchat. And so this gets past the antitrust authorities, who seem more concerned with how the data will be used rather than the accumulation of users. Both United States and European Union regulators examined the WhatsApp deal, but it passed muster because WhatsApp was viewed as a messenger service, something where there was alternative competition.This misses the point that domination is all about users and views. Those companies with users and page views can dominate, and accumulating those users is everything, something only an infinitesimally small number of companies can find the key to doing.The antitrust system results in the increasing oligopoly that we have, where a few companies dominate major industries, accruing the wealth and power that go with it as potential disrupters are swallowed at birth, the way Cronus, the titan in Greek mythology, ate his young to prevent their uprising.No one knows what might happen to Jet if it remained independent. Perhaps it would fail. Amazon is dominant and Walmart may truly be the only real competitor. The same could be said of any of these acquisitions of high-growth companies. So preventing this acquisition may result not in creating a competitor to Amazon but in the eventual death of Jet. This of course would leave its founder and investors much poorer, a true cost.The flip side of this risk is that the big tech companies continue unchallenged in their dominance. Perhaps it is time to rethink antitrust enforcement, and take the risks associated with a different view of antitrust that looks at potential dominance and at breaking up oligopolies. Rhea protected Zeus from Cronus, which eventually led to Cronus\u2019s destruction.If antitrust authorities do not adapt and emerging competitors continue to be bought up, we should not be surprised of the continued dominance of a very few companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Walmart.Advertisement"}

Being Royalty Helps.", "Date": "2016-08-20", "News": "Supported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 His Royal Highness Tunku Imran of Malaysia was sitting in the media center at the badminton arena recently, holding his Olympic credential with both hands. To untrained eyes, it looked like little more than a piece of laminated paper. But the prince\u2019s eyes are anything but untrained.\u201cAccreditation is everything at the Olympics,\u201d he said, \u201cand this is the best one.\u201dSo, it\u2019s as good as gold here?\u201cNo,\u201d he said, offering a polite correction. \u201cIt\u2019s platinum.\u201dLong before the opening ceremony, a very different Olympic competition had already unfolded. It was a contest for access, privilege and prestige, and the results hang like a plastic medal around the necks of thousands of participants here, everyone from athletes and coaches to reporters and a wide array of officials.These credentials are much more than a ticket to an event. These are passes to restricted areas, which might include special seats, better transportation and even entry to the Olympic Village, where athletes are housed.\u201cLiterally, he can go anywhere he wants,\u201d said Dato\u2019 Low Beng Choo, a Malaysian Olympic official who was sitting next to the prince.For the vast majority of people, credentials at the Games are simply a way to get to places you need to be \u2014 the volleyball venue, in the case of a volleyball player, or the press center, in the case of a broadcast journalist. For a rarefied group, though, credentials are where the Olympics become a little bit like the military and a little bit like high school. They reflect status, in gradations too numerous to count.At the top of this pyramid is a group known as the \u201cOlympic Family,\u201d which is not, as it may sound, the relatives of athletes. Rather, it is the members of the various committees and associations that plan, organize and orchestrate the Games.Members of the Olympic Family have separate entrances to events, as well as their own Olympic Family Lounges, which are cordoned-off dens scattered around the Games. Those with the proper mark on their credential \u2014 \u201c6,\u201d as it happens \u2014 can avail themselves of food and comfy sofas.Even within the Olympic Family there are different levels of eminence. Bestriding them all are the roughly 100 members of the International Olympic Committee. Yes, one of them was arrested Wednesday for purportedly selling a few million dollars\u2019 worth of event tickets. But for now, and long after that scandal subsides, I.O.C. members are the pashas of the Games. Their perks include the little-known Olympic Club, which, Prince Imran said, is near the swimming venue.\u201cThey give you a gold card, and you can go anytime you like,\u201d he said. \u201cYou also get two guest passes. Which means you can bring two guests, once. I\u2019ve already used my two guest passes, for my wife and my son. But you can make an application to the I.O.C. and request more.\u201dReviews of the club are mixed. Karl Stoss, an Austrian casino and lottery executive who was elected to the I.O.C. while in Rio, was underwhelmed.\u201cNo atmosphere,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like an airport lounge, but less crowded.\u201d\u201cWe stayed for about 20 minutes and left,\u201d said his friend Peter Mennel, who runs Austria\u2019s National Olympic Committee, making him gold-card eligible.The ultimate I.O.C. perk \u2014 at least theoretically \u2014 is an assigned car and driver. (\u201cT1\u201d on the credential.) This is a slight upgrade from \u201cT3,\u201d which is the right to hop into any car in a fleet ready to chauffeur eligible riders. Each car comes with an O.F.A., an Olympic family assistant, who is supposed to help with interpreting.T1 and T3 cars can drive on recently opened highways and roads, more than 150 miles of pavement that were poured for the Games. They will have an afterlife for residents of Rio, but for now, these are just for properly credentialed cars and buses.See the Summer Games in a series of composite images.This has infuriated locals, who have been forced to cope with worse-than-usual traffic snarls. But remarkably, the system does not seem to have eased much of the friction for its beneficiaries.Prince Imran, for instance, said that his T1 driver had gotten so lost on his way to the women\u2019s rugby sevens final that he caught only the last few minutes of the game. For the men\u2019s final, he tried a minibus, though he had an equally truncated experience.\u201cBoth times, the drivers were unable to find the stadium,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of the roads are new, so Google Maps often doesn\u2019t help. And they need better signage, though I think some of the drivers don\u2019t read the signs. So it\u2019s been a challenge. I think the Brazilians are doing their best. Maybe not enough training, you know.\u201dThe patrician scent wafting from this barely visible dimension of the Games has its origins in the man who all but created the modern Olympics.\u201cIf we step back, the Games were founded by a plucky aristocrat named Pierre de Coubertin, and he assembled dukes and princes to form the International Olympic Committee,\u201d said Jules Boykoff, author of \u201cPower Games: A Political History of the Olympics.\u201d \u201cThe movement has its roots in power and privilege. It has changed mightily over the years and 1981 admitted the first woman into this boys\u2019 club. But it still has an inordinate amount of sheikhs and princes.\u201dAlong with all of these benefits come obligations. Many of the medals are awarded by I.O.C. members, and the prince was scheduled for a ceremony later that day at the velodrome, home of the cycling events.\u201cI\u2019ve done two, and I\u2019m scheduled to do two more,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor for your country.\u201dThen there is the hobnobbing. The 2012 Olympics were called \u201ca gigantic schmoozathon\u201d by Boris Johnson, the mayor of London at the time. For someone like Prince Imran, the Games are a tightly packed schedule of very good meals. There is no mark on his credential for this particular upside. It just comes with the job \u2014 like it or not.\u201cTonight we have dinner at the China House,\u201d he said, referring to the Olympic hosting venue built by the Chinese. \u201cThe invite came last week, and they asked, Which night would you like to come? That\u2019s almost cornering us.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lyft Is Said to Seek a Buyer, Without Success", "Date": "2016-08-19", "News": "Supported byIt is not an easy thing to be an independent ride-hailing company these days.For one, it takes billions of dollars and hundreds of employees to spread to new cities, to market the service and to recruit drivers. Legislators and local laws are often not in your favor. And competitors with deep pockets from all over the world are waiting to cheer if you happen to fail.Lyft, the second-biggest ride-hailing company in the United States behind Uber, is grappling with those forces \u2014 but has found that its options are limited.The company, which is based in San Francisco, has in recent months held talks or made approaches to sell itself to companies including General Motors, Apple, Google, Amazon, Uber and Didi Chuxing, according to a dozen people who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. One person said it was Lyft who was approached by interested parties.Lyft\u2019s discussions were most serious with G.M., which is one of the ride-hailing company\u2019s largest investors. Still, G.M. never made a written offer to buy Lyft, said the people, and in the end, Lyft did not find a buyer.Lyft is not in danger of closing down and has a cash cushion of $1.4 billion, some of these people added, so the company will continue as an independent entity.Still, the talks underline how difficult it has become to operate in the ride-hailing market, where people can book rides from drivers through a smartphone app. While ride-hailing companies do not own fleets of cars and instead rely on drivers who have their own vehicles, the business is highly capital-intensive. Venture capitalists and other investors have poured billions of dollars into the companies.Lyft, a four-year-old company founded by Logan Green and John Zimmer, sprang out of an early long-distance car-pooling program, then called Zimride, in 2007. The goal, the two co-founders have said, was to create a new kind of social ride-sharing, an attempt to decrease the number of cars on the road and to improve congestion, reduce humanity\u2019s environmental footprint and create more efficiency in transportation.That idea has turned into a global movement, as companies worldwide \u2014 like Grab in Southeast Asia, Ola in India, BlaBlaCar in Europe and Uber \u2014 look to upend the global transportation infrastructure.The effort to sell Lyft was aided by bankers at Qatalyst Partners, the boutique investment bank founded by the veteran Silicon Valley banker Frank Quattrone, said the people with knowledge of the talks. Qatalyst declined to comment.Lyft also struggled to find a buyer because of the challenging economics of the ride-hailing business. Companies like Lyft and Uber typically take 20 percent to 25 percent of the cost of each ride. With Lyft drivers expected to pick up an estimated $2 billion or so in fares this year, that meant Lyft\u2019s annual revenue would be about $400 million, according to a person familiar with the company\u2019s financials.That $400 million shrinks after marketing costs are factored in. To win loyalty from drivers who can also work for Uber, Lyft also sometimes lets drivers keep that 20 percent to 25 percent of some rides, so the company effectively earns no revenue in those situations. And in some cases, Lyft provides drivers with additional cash incentives simply to get out on the road, adding to its costs.\u201cOne of the challenges for these companies is to figure out how to grow and sustain that latent demand for these businesses, but also to eventually become profitable,\u201d said Susan Shaheen, co-director of the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cPart of the challenge in evolving those services is just balancing out those factors. And that\u2019s not an easy task.\u201dLyft is not profitable, said a person briefed on the company\u2019s finances. Yet it has a $1.4 billion cash hoard, the person added, and the company thinks that will shield it as it works toward achieving profitability.Ms. Shaheen said an acquisition might still make sense for ride-hailing companies that needed more resources and a bigger size to compete.\u201cThere isn\u2019t a single company that has all of this expertise \u2014 software, manufacturing, ride-sharing \u2014 under one roof,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s where acquisition comes in.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And when people see themselves represented onscreen, they are more likely to pay attention. (Duh.)Warner is known for its leave-no-billboard-unplastered marketing campaigns, and the long push behind \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d was no exception.And, of course, there was extensive digital marketing, including at least five efforts with Snapchat.Warner landed a one-two punch in March by setting up a tattoo parlor at the South by Southwest film, music and interactive media festival. The shop, ostensibly the handiwork of Harley Quinn, a tattooed \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d character played by Margot Robbie, gave free tattoos themed to the film. As in, permanent ones. (There was also a temporary option.)Ms. Robbie was not well known in 2014, when Mr. Silverman helped steer her into the film.

That\u2019s one of several things that often makes China\u2019s market unique in the world, along with a strong nationalist streak, local innovation and good old-fashioned protectionism.Whichever of these you consider paramount, they create a strangely familiar outcome in Uber\u2019s decision to sell its China operations to Didi Chuxing, the local version of Uber\u2019s ride-hailing service.In the business of technology infrastructure, China has also been a tough market. Cisco Systems manages to sell some products, but it has lost much business to Huawei, a Chinese maker of internet gear.

Now, versions of the therapy for a limited number of blood cancers are nearing approval by federal regulators, and could reach the market as early as next year.The technique, known as cell therapy, gives each patient an individualized and souped-up version of their own immune system, one that \u201cworks better than nature made it,\u201d as Dr. June puts it.The patient\u2019s T-cells, the soldiers of the immune system, are extracted from the patient\u2019s blood, then genetically engineered to recognize and destroy cancer. The redesigned cells are multiplied in the laboratory, and millions or billions of them are put back into the patient\u2019s bloodstream, set loose like a vast army of tumor assassins.This is an unusual pharmaceutical \u2014 a drug that is alive and can multiply once inside the body. Dr. June calls these cells \u201cserial killers.\u201d A single one can destroy up to 100,000 cancer cells.The killer cells are genetically engineered to produce a complex protein, an amalgam of pieces from different parts of the immune system that is unlike anything seen before.\u201cI call it a Frankenstein-like molecule,\u201d said Dr. Renier J. Brentjens, the director of cellular therapeutics at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.This radical, science-fictionlike therapy differs sharply from the more established type of immunotherapy, developed by other researchers. Those off-the-shelf drugs, known as checkpoint inhibitors, release a molecular brake on the immune system, freeing it to fight the cancer much as it fights infections by bacteria or viruses.Cell therapy, in contrast, is brewed specially for each patient, one of the many challenges the field faces in broadening its use. So far, the number of patients treated with cell therapy is in the hundreds, not thousands. And for now it works only for certain types of blood cancers, not common malignancies like breast and lung cancer. Researchers are also still working out how to control potentially lethal side effects. Just recently, a clinical trial was briefly halted after three patients died of brain swelling.Still, cell therapy has produced complete remissions in some patients who were out of treatment options, stirring excitement among doctors and patients and setting off a race among companies to bring the treatments to market.Getting to this point has taken decades of painstaking work, with many false starts and setbacks.\u201cIt was conceivable we were pursuing a ghost,\u201d Dr. Rosenberg recalled.The son of Orthodox Jews who immigrated from Poland to New York and ran luncheonettes, Steven Rosenberg was about 6 years old when his family learned that many relatives, including six of his father\u2019s nine siblings, had been murdered in the Holocaust.\u201cI saw so much evil in the world that early on I decided I wanted to do something that would help people, not hurt people,\u201d he said in an interview here. He received a medical degree from Johns Hopkins and a doctorate in biophysics from Harvard.From the start, he was a workaholic. At one point he tried to call off his relationship with Alice O\u2019Connell, whom he would later marry, because he was afraid it would distract him from research.\u201cI loved the night,\u201d Dr. Rosenberg wrote in his book, \u201cThe Transformed Cell,\u201d published in 1992. \u201cI remember the exhilaration of working through the night in the lab, drinking thick pasty coffee that had been on the burner for hours, walking out into the sunrise.\u201d He added: \u201cTo be alone and out on the edge like that, there was no feeling like it in the world.\u201dWhen Dr. Rosenberg arrived at the National Cancer Institute in 1974, his first attempt at immunotherapy was to give patients T-cells harvested from pigs. That failed.He then began giving patients interleukin-2, or IL-2, a protein made by the body that spurs T-cells to proliferate. In some cases he treated patients with their own white blood cells that had been incubated in IL-2. The treatments sometimes set off such a violent immune system reaction that patients had to be placed in intensive care.From 1980 to 1984, he treated 66 patients without success. Then, in late 1984, he encountered patient No. 67, Linda Taylor, a Navy officer with melanoma whose personnel file carried the stamp \u201cdeath imminent.\u201dThe New York Times would like to hear from doctors and patients who have experience giving or receiving immunotherapy treatment for cancer.Ms. Taylor is still alive; her case and others catapulted Dr. Rosenberg and IL-2 onto the cover of Newsweek and the front pages of newspapers. Some of his colleagues at the National Cancer Institute began referring to him as Stevie Wonder, thinking he had developed a swelled head.But IL-2\u2019s vaunted prowess fizzled, helping only a few percent of patients with melanoma or kidney cancer.Dr. Rosenberg then tried to surgically remove tumors and extract the T-cells that had already penetrated them, so-called tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. He multiplied those cells in the lab and infused them back in the patient, along with shots of IL-2. He limited his focus to melanoma, the skin cancer that seemed most susceptible to immune attack.The treatment eventually achieved remissions in about 10 percent to 25 percent of patients. But it was labor-intensive and its application to other cancers unclear.There had to be a better way. Indeed, one approach was taking shape across the street from Dr. Rosenberg, at the Naval Medical Research Institute in Bethesda.The Navy was not Carl June\u2019s desired career choice. Accepted at Stanford in 1971, he instead chose the Naval Academy to avoid the draft and Vietnam. The Navy sent him to medical school and for training in bone-marrow transplantation, geared toward treating people irradiated by nuclear weapons.When the Cold War ended, the Navy lost interest.Dr. June turned to working with T-cells at the Naval Medical Research Institute in the mid-1980s. He and a colleague, Dr. Bruce Levine, found a way to multiply T-cells in huge numbers outside the body, a method still used today. And in the mid-1990s, working with Cell Genesys, a gene therapy company, Dr. June began trying to genetically modify patients\u2019 T-cells to kill H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS.But when his wife, Cindy, the mother of the couple\u2019s three children, developed ovarian cancer in 1996, Dr. June\u2019s research turned personal.Dr. June had tried everything to save her, including the primitive immune therapies under development. But Ms. June died in 2001.\u201cA lot of other scientists would have been disillusioned by the failure, in his case the personal tragedy,\u201d said Sean Parker, the internet billionaire who is funding some of Dr. June\u2019s work.Instead, Dr. June, who had moved to the University of Pennsylvania, stopped treating patients, and devoted himself to creating cell therapies for cancer.\u201cThings that were back burner on cell therapy became front burner,\u201d he said.In the 1980s, scientists began experimenting with gene therapy, putting new genes into cells of the body to treat disease. Michel Sadelain, while still a graduate student studying immunology at the University of Alberta, told colleagues that he thought the technique could be used to supercharge T-cells to fight cancer.\u201cAt the time it sounded very pipe dream,\u201d said Douglas Green, who was one of Dr. Sadelain\u2019s doctoral thesis advisers and is now chairman of immunology at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital.But Dr. Sadelain, he continued, \u201cbelieved in his approach and he pursued it relentlessly.\u201dAfter earning his Ph.D., Dr. Sadelain headed for the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Mass., to learn how to do gene therapy, using disabled viruses that could not cause disease to deliver genes into cells. By 1992, he had demonstrated that he could genetically engineer mouse T-cells.He then moved to Sloan Kettering. In 2003, he and his colleagues \u2014 including his partner and now wife, Isabelle Rivi\u00e8re \u2014 showed that genetically engineered T-cells could eradicate certain cancers in mice.How is this done? To fight cancer, T-cells have to recognize cancerous cells.Each T-cell in the body has unique receptors, sort of like claws that jut out from its surface. T-cells patrol the body looking for protein fragments that indicate a cell might be infected by a bacterium or virus. If one of its claws latches on to such a fragment, the T-cell destroys the cell displaying it.But cancer cells are mutated versions of the body\u2019s own cells, not outsiders. T-cells do not always recognize them as something to kill.So scientists like Dr. Sadelain decided to put a new claw on the T-cells, one that could recognize cancer by latching on to a telltale protein on cancer cells.The new claws came from another part of the immune system known as antibodies. Drug companies already knew how to make antibodies with claws that bind to specific proteins in the body.But the claw was not enough. Once a claw binds to a target protein, it needs a molecule to signal the T-cell to go into killing mode. Yet another signal helps sustain the killing. The DNA instructions for all three components are inserted into the patient\u2019s T-cells.Since this concoction is part antibody and part T-cell, it is a chimera, like the monster of Greek mythology that is part lion, part goat and part serpent. The claw is called a receptor and the protein it binds to on the cancer cell, the target, is called an antigen. So the whole construct is called a chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, and the use of it to treat cancer is called CAR T-cell therapy, or CAR-T.Dr. Sadelain was not alone in this work. Zelig Eshhar, an Israeli scientist, is credited with developing one of the first crude CARs around 1989. Dr. Rosenberg, always on the lookout for new types of immunotherapy, invited Dr. Eshhar to be a visiting scientist in his laboratory at the National Cancer Institute.Another early developer was Dr. Dario Campana of St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital.As scientists worked to perfect the formula in the 1990s and early 2000s, there was quite a bit of sharing. Cancer cell therapy was still mostly an academic exercise; it was highly uncertain whether it would ever really work.Dr. June, after hearing a presentation by Dr. Campana at a conference in 2003, requested a sample of Dr. Campana\u2019s CAR. Dr. Sadelain shared his design with both Dr. June and Dr. Rosenberg. The most prominent CAR developed at the National Cancer Institute owes a lot to Dr. Sadelain, Dr. Rosenberg said.But the science proved difficult and the research money scarce. Pharmaceutical companies showed little interest, preferring mass-produced drugs, one size fits all, rather than a treatment that would be made separately for each patient.Again, a death from cancer propelled the field forward. In 2001, a 44-year-old woman, Kimberly Lawrence Netter, succumbed to breast cancer. Her father-in-law, Edward Netter, a wealthy financial services entrepreneur, and his wife, Barbara, formed the nonprofit Alliance for Cancer Gene Therapy, which issued some of its first grants to Dr. June and Dr. Sadelain. Dr. June also got support from the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.\u201cWithout that,\u201d Dr. June said of the charities, \u201cwe would not have had a clinical trial.\u201dAs the first decade of this century neared its end, the three pioneers were ready for the big moment \u2014 testing their treatments in patients. They scrambled to be the first to announce peer-reviewed results.Dr. Rosenberg and colleagues published first, in the journal Blood in 2010. They described a single patient with lymphoma whose tumors shrank after treatment. (The patient later received more therapy, and has been free of cancer since.)But the approach really attracted attention the next year when Dr. June reported that two of three patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia went into complete remission.One of them, Doug Olson, a chemist from Tinicum Township, Pa., left the hospital and immediately bought a sailboat. He also took to running half-marathons.\u201cIt was like this weight that had been sitting there was gone,\u201d said Mr. Olson, who is free of cancer nearly six years later.Bill Ludwig, a retired captain in the New Jersey Department of Corrections, had already paid for his funeral when he started treatment in August 2010. Once his genetically engineered T-cells were unleashed in his system, Mr. Ludwig\u2019s lungs started to fail, his legs ballooned to twice their size, his blood pressure dropped and he began hallucinating.When he emerged from the ordeal, doctors searched for cancer. Detecting none, they ordered another test, certain of error. But there was no mistake. Five pounds of tumor had been destroyed.Mr. Ludwig, now 71, and his wife bought an R.V. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make up for lost time,\u201d he said. He has celebrated the high school graduations of five grandchildren and welcomed his first great-grandchild.As for Dr. June, Mr. Ludwig said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe someone who basically saved your life. He lost the one he loved, and turned around and saved me years later.\u201dThe 2011 publication of Dr. June\u2019s results transformed the field.Novartis, the big Swiss pharmaceutical company, licensed the rights to the therapies created in Dr. June\u2019s lab at the University of Pennsylvania, throwing aside concerns that treatments manufactured for individual patients would not be good business. That set off a commercial rush, flooding the field with cash after years of doubt.While various companies are in pursuit, three are in the lead. They hope to win approval from the Food and Drug Administration to bring the first CAR treatments to market as early as 2017 or 2018, although it is not yet clear how easy it will be to get regulatory approval for such a novel therapy.The companies are teamed with academic pioneers: Novartis with Penn; Kite Pharma with the National Cancer Institute; and Juno Therapeutics with Sloan Kettering, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital.Somewhat predictably, success provoked jostling and envy. Rather than being allies against a disbelieving world, the pioneers now had something worth fighting over \u2014 credit, and the gleam of a possible Nobel Prize.While the Sloan Kettering researchers had done some of the early genetic engineering, they did not publish strong results in five patients until 2013. By then, they had been scooped by Dr. Rosenberg with one patient and Dr. June with three.St. Jude sued the University of Pennsylvania. Novartis sided with Penn, and Juno Therapeutics with St. Jude.Patrick M. Coughlin, who teaches anatomy at the Commonwealth Medical College in Scranton, Pa., now explains the immune system to his classes by telling how one man overcame cancer. Only gradually does it become clear that he is referring to himself.Now 63, Mr. Coughlin noticed a mass the size of a softball in his abdomen in summer 2013. It was a form of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. Three different types of chemotherapy and a bone-marrow transplant all failed to help him. Desperate, he came to the National Institutes of Health campus here last year for the cell therapy developed by Dr. Rosenberg\u2019s team.The battle between Mr. Coughlin\u2019s genetically engineered immune cells and the cancer was brutal. For four days he had a fever as high as 105, chills and bed-soaking sweats. Even his brain malfunctioned \u2014 at one point he could not count to 10 or write his wife\u2019s name.But when the battle ended, the cancer was no longer there. \u201cIf I had gotten this thing five years ago,\u201d he said of his disease, \u201cI\u2019d be dead.\u201dYet for all the excitement, there are reasons for caution. The CAR therapy works now only for patients with some B-cell lymphomas and leukemias, which account for only about 80,000 of the 1.7 million cases of cancer diagnosed in the United States each year. It has not been successfully used to treat malignancies of the lungs, breast, prostate, colon or other organs.\u201cThe solid tumors that kill over 90 percent of people do not respond to anything we have now,\u201d Dr. Rosenberg said.Because it is personalized, cell therapy is likely to be frightfully expensive \u2014 probably hundreds of thousands of dollars per patient, though the companies bringing these treatments to market have not yet said how much they would charge.Producing the re-engineered cells is lengthy and complex. Some patients have died during the two to four weeks it took to genetically modify and multiply their cells.And the therapy itself can be arduous. First, patients get chemotherapy to wipe out many of their existing T-cells to make room for the engineered ones. Once those enter the body, they can set off a ferocious immune response as well as temporary neurological problems like memory loss, seizures and hallucinations.Recently Juno Therapeutics had to temporarily halt its clinical trial after three patients died from brain swelling. The problem arose when the company added a second chemotherapy drug to the regimen preparing the patients for the cell infusion. The authorities allowed the trial to resume without that chemotherapy drug.Still, some patients find themselves hoping they get violently ill, since that is a sign the treatment is working.\u201cEvery morning my wife would ask me how I\u2019m feeling,\u201d said Myles Stiefvater, a copier salesman from Newark, Del., who had the treatment in 2014. When he said he felt O.K., they were disappointed.Researchers are also finding, to their dismay, that remissions do not always last. The therapy has had its biggest success in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, producing complete remissions for 60 percent to more than 90 percent of patients. Yet up to half of those patients eventually suffer a relapse.In some cases, the tumor evolves so that it no longer displays on its surface what the claw binds to, making it invisible to the engineered cells. In other cases, the engineered cells might not last long enough in the body, giving the cancer a chance to resurge.Karen Shollenberger, a student at Drexel University with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, thought she was in the clear after being in remission for nine months after a CAR-T treatment.But in September, as the school year was beginning, the cancer returned.She entered a new trial testing a new CAR therapy directed at another protein on B-cells. Again the cancer went into remission, and she returned to school.But fear lurked in her: What if the new therapy also stopped working? That indeed happened recently. Her best hope now is a bone-marrow transplant.\u201cEach relapse is increasingly terrifying as the options continue to shrink,\u201d said Ms. Shollenberger, 22. But, she said, the cell therapies have given her nearly two good years.The big thrust now is to expand the use of cell therapy to additional types of cancer.The key is to find protein targets that the engineered T-cells can latch on to to kill cancer cells. Ideally, such a protein should be on all the tumor cells, so the entire cancer would be eradicated. But it should not be on healthy cells, or they would also be destroyed, causing side effects.\u201cT-cells are very powerful,\u201d said Dr. Campana, formerly of St. Jude and now at the National University of Singapore. \u201cIn the same way they can eliminate cancer, they can also kill you.\u201dA protein called HER2, for instance, is found on many breast and other tumors, making it a seemingly good target. But it is also found in tiny amounts in the lungs. When Dr. Rosenberg\u2019s team infused killer T-cells aimed at HER2 into a patient, she went into respiratory distress within 15 minutes and died five days later.The treatments work for the blood cancers because there is a good target. But finding these for the most common cancers has been difficult.One problem is that CARs, because of how they are made, can bind only to proteins on the surface of cancer cells. But most proteins made by these cells, or by any cell for that matter, are inside the cell, out of reach.There is an alternative approach that is gaining interest. Patients\u2019 immune cells can be engineered to make what are called T-cell receptors, or TCRs. These can recognize proteins inside the cancer cells.Some experts say TCRs, which have a far wider array of potential targets, represent the best hope of using cell therapy to treat solid tumors. There have been hints of effectiveness already in treating one of those, a type of sarcoma.It might turn out that the best target for each patient will be unique to that person. Scientists are now experimenting with using DNA sequencing and other techniques to find the best mutated protein in each person\u2019s tumor at which to aim the claw.\u201cThink of how dauntingly personalized this is,\u201d Dr. Rosenberg said. \u201cWe are using their own cells to treat a unique mutation in their own tumor.\u201dHe said this approach might allow cell therapy to be used for most patients.Many other improvements are on the runway.Dr. Sadelain and Juno are working on \u201carmored CARs\u201d that not only bind to the target but produce immune-stimulating chemicals. Cellectis, a French company, has treated two babies with an off-the-shelf CAR treatment that does not require each patient\u2019s cells to be processed. Bellicum Pharmaceuticals is working on genetic switches that dim or shut off the CAR if the treatment is endangering the patient.\u201cWe\u2019re in the Model T version of the CAR now,\u201d said Dr. Levine, now the director of the cell production facility at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cWhat\u2019s coming along are Google CARs and Tesla CARs.\u201dIn February, the Novartis-Penn Center for Advanced Cellular Therapeutics opened on the ninth floor of a Penn medical building, paid for mainly by $20 million from Novartis. It has gleaming new laboratory space, clean rooms with the capacity to manufacture therapy for 400 patients a year, and a great view of downtown Philadelphia. On the wall are photographs of patients with success stories, like Doug Olson running a half-marathon and, of course, Emily Whitehead.Dr. June, who remarried and had two more children, now jets off regularly to attend conferences and give talks. A world map hanging outside his office is titled \u201cWhere in the World Is Carl June?\u201d It has pins stuck in every location he has been, and a picture of him on a bicycle pinned to his location at the moment.In the last two years he has visited more than 150 cities in more than 20 countries. This year alone he has accumulated more than 200,000 airline miles. Despite that schedule, he runs ultramarathons and participated in July in the Death Ride, a grueling bicycle race in California.Dr. Rosenberg still arrives at the National Cancer Institute nearly seven days a week. The walls outside his office are covered with signed photographs of the hundreds of fellows who have trained under him, many of them now leaders in immunotherapy. Every five years, they gather for a reunion, to reminisce and honor their mentor.Arie Belldegrun, who was a fellow in the 1980s, now runs Kite, the company commercializing the National Cancer Institute\u2019s CAR technology. He recounted what happened when he tried to get Dr. Rosenberg to join the company.\u201cHe sits quietly, quietly, quietly, and then he asks, \u2018Arie, why don\u2019t you ask me what I want to do?\u2019\u201cHe said: \u2018Every day that I go to work, I\u2019m as excited as a kid coming to a new place for the first time. If you ask me what I want to do, I want to die on this desk one day.\u2019\u201dBut not before he conquers cancer.\u201cI want to end this holocaust,\u201d Dr. Rosenberg said in the interview. \u201cI think I\u2019m finally getting the hang of what it will take to widely apply this to cancers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Michael C. Bernardi Channels His Father for a Day as Tevye in \u2018Fiddler\u2019", "Date": "2016-08-22", "News": "Supported byHis father was among the most famous Tevyes of all time, playing the role for years on Broadway and on tour. His grandparents were mainstays of the Yiddish theater, at times performing from the Sholom Aleichem stories that became \u201cFiddler on the Roof.\u201dTalk about tradition.Herschel Bernardi played Tevye, a cash-poor but faith-rich Jewish milkman with five daughters living in czarist Russia, more than 700 times on Broadway and several hundred more times on the road; he was nominated for a Tony Award for playing the role in a 1981 Broadway revival. While his son plays the show\u2019s innkeeper \u2014 a minor role \u2014 in the revival, which opened last year, he is also one of two Tevye understudies, and at Wednesday\u2019s matinee he will step in for the show\u2019s star, Danny Burstein.As in every performance, Mr. Bernardi will be wearing his father\u2019s brown leather Tevye boots.\u201cIt\u2019s taken me a long time to really process what all of this means,\u201d Mr. Bernardi said during an interview in his shared fifth-floor dressing room at the Broadway Theater, where there are costume sketches, pictures of Jews in shtetls and a keep-it-real note to himself (\u201cMordcha didn\u2019t go to acting school\u201d), but no photos of his father. \u201cThere are certain times when it\u2019s like: \u2018Am I a guinea pig in some scientific, psychological journal right now? What is going on?\u2019\u201dThe younger Mr. Bernardi started performing publicly at age 8, doing stand-up comedy in Los Angeles, where he grew up. In high school he discovered a passion for plays \u2014 he says he preferred them to musicals as he tried to find his own way in the theater. He studied acting at the State University of New York, Purchase.He had to be persuaded. \u201cI had this moment where I could feel the fear,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like: \u2018Oh, God, that\u2019s the ring of fire, to play the role that your father was famous for. Oh, God. Comparison, comparison, comparison.\u2019 But I knew I had to do it.\u201dThat production\u2019s director, Ron Fassler, is also an actor; he said he was certain the younger Mr. Bernardi could play Tevye. \u201cI knew it was inside him, but he was tentative, and it scared him a little,\u201d Mr. Fassler said, recalling an evening, just before opening, when Mr. Bernardi burst into tears after a rehearsal, overwhelmed by the experience.Mr. Bernardi, who wore his father\u2019s jacket, vest, cap and shirt through that summer run, was not the only one who felt the connection: One night, a couple approached him after the performance, offering him the Playbill from a \u201cFiddler\u201d performance starring his father that they had attended on their first date more than four decades earlier.While performing in Massachusetts, Mr. Bernardi sent in an audition tape for the Broadway revival; he heard nothing back, but went to New York to introduce himself to the casting directors. Ultimately, he got the role of Mordcha and has been in the show since it began performances last November.\u201cIn the beginning, honestly, I felt like I was doing a s\u00e9ance,\u201d Mr. Bernardi said. \u201c\u2018Fiddler\u2019 already conjures up so many images of people\u2019s histories, of their immigrant parents \u2014 when you go to the stage door, people say, \u2018It was like I was watching my grandparents rise from the floor.\u2019\u201dMr. Bernardi said he shared that sentiment but has to move past it.\u201cTo do the job, and to tell the story, I can\u2019t live there,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve really had to make a concerted effort to know what Mordcha knows, to know what Tevye knows, and to live their story \u2014 and I can trust that my story is there.\u201dAnd his story is inextricably bound up with \u201cFiddler.\u201d In utero, his mother says, he would kick when his father would sing; his father turned to \u201cFiddler\u201d material to calm his mother while she was delivering him via emergency C-section. In the years after his father\u2019s death, the younger Mr. Bernardi would listen to \u201cAn Evening With Herschel Bernardi,\u201d an album of live performances of folk songs and stories. (The cover image: his father\u2019s face inside a bagel.) And, in the age of Google and YouTube, the younger Mr. Bernardi has been able to watch performances by his father online.\u201cHe was a kid that really missed having a father, and he asked a lot of questions about him,\u201d said his mother, Teri Bernardi. \u201cThe only way I could connect him to his father, when he did ask, was to tell him stories his father had told me.\u201dMr. Bernardi said that being in the revival had \u201cprovided me with the fatherly lessons that I\u2019ve craved for over 30 years and never got.\u201d And, he said, he could feel his dad\u2019s presence.\u201cOnce in a blue moon, I\u2019ll be sitting alone, maybe having an issue, and I just let it get real quiet, and connect,\u201d he said. \u201cListen, I believe in science, and science hasn\u2019t really proven anything when it comes to the afterlife, and so I can accept that the voice that I hear back is a part of my own brain. But I know that it is a part of my brain that\u2019s the best father that could possibly be.\u201dHe is scheduled to play Tevye for just that one performance, and acknowledges that he has no idea how it will go, or what he will do after the revival closes on Dec. 31. But he has invited his mother, his father\u2019s children from his first marriage and other relatives and friends, determined to share the moment.\u201cRegardless of if I fall into the orchestra pit, it\u2019s going to be an incredible sense of pride to know that I stood on the Broadway stage and played Tevye,\u201d he said.\u201cThe stories of Sholom Aleichem, and \u2018Fiddler on the Roof\u2019, have put food on my family\u2019s table for generations,\u201d he added. \u201cEven if I never sang one note of \u2018Fiddler,\u2019 this show is responsible for my survival \u2014 it\u2019s responsible for my life.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He\u2019s a prig and I wish he had lost his primary to that tattooed guy who likes me.I\u2019m sorry I pretended I was going to release my tax returns. Of course I didn\u2019t pay any taxes. I have the all-time greatest real estate deductions and depreciations.I\u2019m sorry I asked African-Americans \u201cWhat do you have to lose by supporting me?\u201d in front of a crowd of white people. I\u2019m sorry I can never find my African-American.I\u2019m sorry I continue lying about my wild gesticulations mocking a disabled reporter at the failing New York Times. And I\u2019m really sorry that Hillary\u2019s super PAC used it in an ad and made me look like an oaf.I\u2019m sorry I have to sacrifice so much to make America great again. No one would believe the hatred spewed at me on Twitter. It\u2019s amazing how much super-nasty stuff can be packed into 140 characters. Cyberbullying stinks. I\u2019m sorry Al Gore invented the internet.I\u2019m sorry, given how horribly I\u2019m doing with women, that I need Roger Ailes to help me with the debates and my post-campaign media company. Many people are saying we should call it the \u201cWe Only Hire Foxes\u201d network.I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t google Paul Manafort and see that he had more shady Russian connections than a James Bond villain. I\u2019m also sorry I had to cut him loose. He had a lot of experience propping up dictators. But Paul didn\u2019t know how to play the Trumpet. He had these old-fashioned ideas that when I bravely took on the Khans and that rude baby at the rally that I was punching below my weight. And he didn\u2019t appreciate the genius of my taco bowl tweet.Speaking of tacos, I\u2019m sorry nobody understood why a Mexican judge could not be fair to me because of the wall. Isn\u2019t it obvious why a Mexican-American is the same as a Mexican but a German-Scottish American is a pure American?I hated to ship Paul off to Siberia. But Jared and Corey told me I couldn\u2019t get swept up in an international money-laundering scandal while I was accusing Hillary of doing favors at State for a money launderer and Clinton Foundation donor.Paul will be fine. I\u2019m sure that the $12 million he got for guiding the Russian puppet in Ukraine and plotting to annex Crimea \u2014 wherever that is \u2014 was just a taste of what\u2019s in his offshore bank account.I\u2019m sorry everyone is calling my new campaign C.E.O., Steve Bannon, the \u201cMost Dangerous Man in America.\u201d That\u2019s my job. And I\u2019m sorry that everyone is disgusted that I hired the guy who made Breitbart a white nationalist manifesto. The website is right-wing and right: White European immigrants like Melania, good. Third Worlders demanding welfare, bad. Close the borders and expel the invaders. #WinterIsComing.The coolest thing is, when Steve was an investment banker, he got a stake in \u201cSeinfeld\u201d and made millions. So now I have my very own soup Nazi!People just have to get used to going from dapper Paul to stubbled Bannon in his wrinkled cargo shorts. He looks like he just stepped out of a vat of Guinness. Roger Stone was right to put him on his Worst-Dressed List. I\u2019ll get him squared away with some Trump suits and ties from China.Steve and I have so much in common. We both love crazy conspiracy theories, like the one Bannon peddles about Huma being tied to the Islamic group who funded 9/11. I\u2019m sorry Huma is posing for Vogue instead of keeping her husband, the pervert, from sexting online again.I\u2019m sorry that it doesn\u2019t matter who runs my campaign because I always speak with myself, No. 1, because I have a very good brain and I\u2019m very rich.I\u2019m sorry that while I\u2019m being too honest, Crooked Hillary is never really sorry for all her lies and illegal operations. She\u2019s like Lyin\u2019 Lochte, just sorry she got caught. Hearing her apologize is as likely as seeing those 33,000 yoga emails.I\u2019m sorry the Clintons didn\u2019t realize until now how bad it was to be using the State Department as a favor factory for big donors to the foundation. I\u2019m all for pay-for-play, but only at my golf courses.I\u2019m sorry Hillary had to besmirch poor Colin Powell by claiming he gave her the idea for private emails. Hasn\u2019t his reputation suffered enough pushing that phony war at the U.N.? Have I mentioned that I was against the Iraq war before the British mapmakers invented Iraq? I\u2019m sorry more people don\u2019t believe that.And I\u2019m sorry Hillary is so unhealthy and weak that she hardly ever campaigns and needs pillows to prop her up when she does. I\u2019m sorry to say that she does not have the stamina to take on ISIS. But I am not sorry to say that I am fully recovered from the bone spurs that got me out of Vietnam and ready to kick the you-know-what out of ISIS.I\u2019m sorry that Hillary won\u2019t stop playing \u201cFight Song.\u201dMost of all, I\u2019m sorry that I\u2019m not really sorry.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Producing Clean Power Turned Out to Be a Messy Business", "Date": "2016-08-13", "News": "Supported byOn the edge of a bucolic field in Princeton, N.J., an eco-friendly office building recently opened its doors. Plants festoon the roof, a living wall is planned for the lobby, and rainwater storage tanks supply the building\u2019s needs. In the parking lot there are wind turbines, solar panels and electric vehicle charging stations.It is the picture of a sustainable future, one in which society\u2019s insatiable demand for electricity can be met without polluting the planet.The same cannot be said of the building\u2019s tenant, NRG Energy.The biggest independent power producer in the country, NRG sells electricity to utilities, companies and individual homes. To generate all that wattage, it burns enormous amounts of natural gas, coal and oil, making NRG one of the country\u2019s biggest polluters.It isn\u2019t trying to muck up the planet; that\u2019s just the nature of the business NRG is in. The electricity industry is the biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. In 2014, NRG was the fourth-largest emitter of carbon dioxide among the country\u2019s power producers.The business of providing Americans with electricity hasn\u2019t evolved much in a century. But today, growing concerns about climate change, affordable wind and solar power, and the potential for distributed generation are pressuring utilities and power producers like NRG to clean up their acts, and fast.\u201cOur industry is going though massive transformation, the likes of which we\u2019ve never seen,\u201d said Mauricio Gutierrez, the recently installed chief executive of NRG. \u201cThe industry has never seen this much turnover.\u201dAll this transformation has been particularly tumultuous for NRG, which has weathered more than its share of mishaps and unintended consequences: In May, for example, a fire knocked out a crucial tower at a cutting-edge but troubled solar power plant that the company manages in the Southern California desert. Its big bets on residential solar and on a national charging network for electric vehicles were ahead of their time and fizzled.The shale and fracking booms in the United States made natural gas cheap and abundant, pulling down the price of electricity and making power sources that NRG still depends on heavily \u2014 including coal, nuclear and renewables \u2014 less profitable. Investors lost faith in the company, NRG\u2019s stock plummeted, and its previous chief executive was summarily fired, replaced by Mr. Gutierrez.Far from emerging as an industry pioneer, NRG has become a cautionary tale. A power-hungry nation needs to change the way it is fueled, but as NRG shows, transitioning to clean power is messy business.\u201cThe power producers and utilities are the canaries in the coal mine,\u201d said Aron Cramer, C.E.O. of Business for Social Responsibility, a consulting firm. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a lot of road kill in the midst of this transition to a lower-carbon energy system.\u201dNo two companies face the exact same set of challenges. But at some level, the quandary preoccupying NRG is one that all power producers and utilities will ultimately face: how to make more electricity while emitting fewer greenhouse gases.NRG wasn\u2019t always a clean-energy proponent. Until recently, it was just another power producer, burning fossil fuels to electrify the grid.In 2003, it tapped David Crane to be its chief executive. Mr. Crane, who previously ran a traditional London-based power company, set about expanding NRG\u2019s core business. He acquired Reliant Energy, which sells electricity to homes and businesses in Texas, as well as GenOn Energy, a rival based in Houston. These moves vastly expanded NRG\u2019s scale, and its emissions.By 2006, Mr. Crane began to respond to the climate crisis and became one of the country\u2019s most unlikely environmentalists.At first, he made modest changes. NRG bought a wind power company, which it later sold. Soon, though, Mr. Crane made large investments in wind and solar plants and spent heavily on pet projects like a national network of electric-car charging stations.Seemingly overnight, the fossil fuels executive became a champion of renewable energy. He wanted to turn the hub-and-spoke utility model \u2014 with big power plants sending electricity out to homes and businesses \u2014 inside out.\u201cIt\u2019s the destiny of NRG to be a leader,\u201d Mr. Crane said at the groundbreaking of the new headquarters, \u201cto create a more sustainable and prosperous future while winning the fight against climate change.\u201dMr. Crane was channeling the spirit of the time. In December, world leaders in Paris pledged to combat climate change. The United States said it would cut its greenhouse gas emissions by more than a quarter in 10 years. With wind and solar power cheaper than ever and consumers starting to embrace energy-saving technologies, these targets could be within reach.But the climate crisis won\u2019t be solved with more Teslas alone. If the goals set in Paris are to be met, big electricity producers like NRG will need to reduce emissions while increasing power production. So Mr. Crane set about trying to retool NRG\u2019s fleet of dirty power plants while building a new generation of utility-scale wind and solar projects.NRG\u2019s dual personality \u2014 fossil fuel giant and clean energy pioneer \u2014 is on display at two relatively new facilities on opposite ends of the country.Just south of Los Angeles International Airport, four smokestacks punctuate the sandy coastline. There in one form or another since the 1950s, they are part of the El Segundo Energy Center, which produces enough electricity to power nearly 450,000 homes.At first glance, it is just another power plant burning cheap and abundant natural gas. Yet the El Segundo plant is among the most sophisticated of its kind. The two operational units, which came online in 2013, replaced inefficient relics constructed a half-century ago. Wastewater is recycled, emissions controls minimize the production of nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide, and a mix of combustion and steam turbines greatly enhance the amount of energy derived from the gas.And perhaps most critically, the El Segundo Energy Center is only occasionally generating power.A generation ago, it operated almost constantly, feeding the vast energy needs of Los Angeles. But over the last several years, big power companies \u2014 including NRG \u2014 have constructed enormous solar power plants in Southern California, supplying a growing share of daytime electricity.When the sun is shining, NRG\u2019s new high-tech gas-fired power plant is often dormant, coming alive only when demand ramps up and the sun has dimmed. In that sense, the El Segundo plant is a big leap forward. Yet the very need to pour millions of dollars into retrofitting this gas-fired plant on the picturesque shore of the Pacific Ocean shows just how much work has yet to be done.Across the country, in Spencer, Mass., NRG is putting the final touches on a community solar project on the grounds of St. Joseph\u2019s Abbey, a Trappist monastery. There, on rolling green hills near the monks\u2019 quarters, hundreds of hard-hatted workers are busy erecting thousands of solar panels.The electricity generated from those panels will flow through new transmission lines, which were required because the existing grid infrastructure could not handle the influx of solar energy. The project will power about 2,000 nearby homes, which should have lower and more reliable electricity bills.By NRG\u2019s standards, the solar plant is relatively small, but more are in the works. With enough such plants on the grid, they could help NRG achieve its ambitious emissions reductions targets.This is exactly the kind of change that Mr. Crane championed. And yet he is no longer the chief executive of NRG. He was abruptly fired in December, after NRG stock plummeted 63 percent in a year.Earnings fell as cheap natural gas made NRG\u2019s coal-fired plants less competitive, and investors had grown weary of Mr. Crane\u2019s focus on clean energy. Even as NRG\u2019s core business was losing money, Mr. Crane devoted much of his quarterly earnings calls to discussions about clean-power projects.\u201cWe all believe in renewables,\u201d said Shahriar Pourreza, an analyst with Guggenheim Partners. \u201cBut there was such a change in the message of the company that investors lost confidence in the management team.\u201dThe NRG board named the company\u2019s chief operating officer, Mr. Gutierrez, as the new leader. He had grown up in Mexico City, where electricity was sometimes spotty. Mr. Gutierrez joined his family\u2019s engineering company, then worked for Dynegy, a power producer in Houston, before joining NRG. Yet he says that like his predecessor, he is committed to environmental stewardship.\u201cWhen a spiritual leader like the pope calls out our moral responsibility toward the environment, it\u2019s a pretty big thing,\u201d Mr. Gutierrez said. \u201cIt transcends science and policy.\u201dHe was engaged in efforts to combat climate change well before Paris. As Mr. Crane\u2019s C.O.O., he led an NRG task force that recommended that the company adopt ambitious targets for emissions reduction. Mr. Gutierrez recently recommitted to those goals. \u201cRenewables is something that\u2019s very important for our portfolio,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s good business.\u201dMr. Gutierrez has a tricky balancing act. He must appease demanding investors and a skittish board, which most likely means reining in some of Mr. Crane\u2019s clean-energy ventures. Yet he must also fill the shoes of a chief executive who had raised hopes among environmentalists that a big energy producer was getting serious about climate change. He must profitably manage gas and coal assets \u2014 which still make up most of the company\u2019s power generation, sales and profits \u2014 while also preparing for a future that is more dependent on solar and wind.Analysts are pleased with Mr. Gutierrez\u2019s performance so far. He has simplified the corporate structure, played down some of Mr. Crane\u2019s side projects and focused on the balance sheet. NRG shares have risen 40 percent since Mr. Gutierrez took over.\u201cWith the old management, there was such a change in message, the company started to lose credibility,\u201d Mr. Pourreza said. \u201cMauricio is leading this company in the right direction.\u201dBut how NRG will actually achieve vast reductions in its carbon footprint is unclear. As long as it is burning so much gas and coal, it will remain a major emitter of greenhouse gases. And while Mr. Gutierrez speaks hopefully of developments in carbon-capture technology and utility-scale battery storage, practical solutions remain elusive. \u201cDo we have a perfect line of sight on how we\u2019re going to get there? No,\u201d he said. \u201cDo we have a road map? Yes.\u201dComplicating matters, the Obama administration\u2019s signature effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector \u2014 the Clean Power Plan \u2014 is tied up in the courts. (NRG was among the companies that petitioned the E.P.A. to modify the plan, arguing that it made the power sector too reliant on natural gas.) The ambiguous fate of that plan has added regulatory uncertainty to an industry already in flux.\u201cYou have these goals set in Paris, you have a framework for getting there through the Clean Power Plan, and you have the judicial branch saying stop,\u201d said Ralph Izzo, chief executive of Public Service Enterprise Group, a New Jersey utility. \u201cYou can\u2019t make economic decisions in that environment.\u201dEven NRG\u2019s big renewable projects \u2014 installations that are supposed to one day replace coal- and gas-fired plants \u2014 are mired in problems. In the Southern California desert, NRG oversees operations at Ivanpah, the world\u2019s largest solar thermal installation, where thousands of mirrors reflect the sun at enormous towers and water is converted to steam that powers turbines. NRG owns the plant along with BrightSource Energy and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.Heralded as a beacon of clean energy when it opened in 2014, Ivanpah has been continually troubled.From the outset, it produced less electricity than expected. Over the last few years, the cost of solar panels fell sharply, making Ivanpah\u2019s power comparatively expensive. In March, the consortium that owns the plant nearly defaulted on a contract with Pacific Gas & Electric, the Northern California utility.Then in May, a fire at the plant knocked out one of the towers, raising new questions about the project\u2019s viability. Last week, when NRG reported quarterly earnings, it said that revenue from its renewables businesses was down 14 percent to $57 million, largely the result of problems at Ivanpah.This isn\u2019t the first time that a big energy company has made ambitious plans to become a leader in green energy, only to be reined in. In 2000, BP introduced its \u201cBeyond Petroleum\u201d tagline and began investing heavily in renewable energy. It committed billions of dollars to wind and solar projects, and made investments in carbon capture and biofuels.After a decade of investment, BP largely backed off its renewables program. Most of its money was still coming from oil and gas, and the company set about selling its solar and wind power assets. They simply weren\u2019t profitable enough.\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to recall that 10 years ago BP was one of the darlings of the green movement,\u201d said Justin Adams, managing director of global lands for the Nature Conservancy and a former executive at BP working on renewables.\u201cThrough that period, some investors were interested, most were ambivalent at best and some downright skeptical at worst,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat on earth was BP doing, taking its eyes off its core business and tinkering around with renewables?\u201dAt NRG, Mr. Gutierrez has already backed away from residential solar and electric-vehicle charging projects that Mr. Crane held so dear. So far, however, there are no signs that NRG will completely reverse course. Mr. Gutierrez is still pushing community solar power, and NRG provides solar installations to big companies like Whole Foods. Last week, NRG spent nearly $200 million to acquire more solar and wind assets.Today, NRG generates about 9 percent of its electricity from renewable assets, up from less than 1 percent in 2008, and that figure is likely to grow. Across the industry, a majority of power plants being built today use renewables, not fossil fuels.\u201cThe sad moral of this story is that it\u2019s very hard to be a C.E.O. for tomorrow, when the markets only care about being a C.E.O. for today,\u201d said Mr. Cramer of Business for Social Responsibility. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone really questions his vision, but he wasn\u2019t given any opportunity to put it into action.\u201dMr. Gutierrez says he shares his predecessor\u2019s vision. By 2050, he envisions enormous batteries storing solar power generated during the day, allowing people to use it at night. Distributed energy will be more common, as Mr. Crane predicted. Carbon-capture technology will make the burning of fossil fuels much less environmentally destructive, Mr. Gutierrez hopes. Perhaps coal-fired power plants will be gone altogether.\u201cWe are a part of the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are also a big part of the solution.\u201dIt\u2019s an appealing vision of a green energy system, one that could fulfill the needs of an electricity-hungry world without spoiling the environment. But how NRG gets there \u2014 especially with investors and a board that seem intolerant of bold steps \u2014 remains vague at best. For now, Mr. Gutierrez is caught in the middle: hoping to arrive at a cleaner future while still satisfying today\u2019s investors, rolling out fields of solar while also burning tons of gas and coal.\u201cLet\u2019s all acknowledge that we can\u2019t change our energy system overnight,\u201d Mr. Cramer said. \u201cBut how do we start making meaningful progress? Saying 90 percent by 2050 is the easy part. We need to start making progress now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He got to know Mr. Brin and Mr. Page through a longtime friend, Anne Wojcicki, a founder of the genetics company 23andMe who was married to Mr. Brin.When Mr. Maris founded GV in 2009, some Silicon Valley investors were skeptical that a venture arm of a large corporation could become a major player in start-up investing. Corporate venture capital firms have traditionally had a spotty record of success.Mr. Maris has described how he pushed executives at Google to let him run GV as a traditional venture firm, with little input from corporate executives, so that it could compete with independent venture firms such as Benchmark and Sequoia Capital.In addition to Mr. Krane, GV has a dozen investment professionals and dozens of employees who advise start-ups on engineering, design, marketing and recruiting. The firm, which invests money provided by Alphabet, oversees around $2.4 billion.\u201cI don\u2019t think I could leave GV in a better place or in better hands,\u201d Mr. Maris said. \u201cI\u2019m excited for the team.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Boulder, Where Inner Peace Meets Outer Beauty", "Date": "2016-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCultured TravelerMy cultural pilgrimage to the Rocky Mountains began more than 20 years ago, a few steps from my door in the East Village of Manhattan. The poet Allen Ginsberg was staging one of the regular readings at St. Mark\u2019s Church in-the-Bowery, featuring his Buddhist-inspired verse. As he fielded queries after the reading, he mentioned that he was decamping to teach at something called the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics in, of all places, Boulder, Colo.Poetry in Boulder? Until then, I had envisioned the town as a high-altitude boot camp, where every resident dressed in colorful spandex and went hiking, biking and climbing with grim determination. When it came to culture, it was hard to imagine anything more profound than the \u201cMork and Mindy\u201d house, whose exterior is featured in the TV series. But Ginsberg insisted that Boulder was actually brimming with progressive artists, writers and musicians. It used to be called \u201cthe Athens of the West,\u201d he enthused.So as an Amazonian heat wave descended on New York a year ago, I decided to finally make the expedition to the Rockies to answer a question: How does culture thrive in a world of free-climbers and triathletes, who one might think are more concerned with perfectly formed abs than deeper questions of the soul? Or has Boulder\u2019s very intimacy with the great outdoors created a cultural scene all its own?Arriving on a hot but blissfully dry July night was a disorienting experience, and not just because of the thin alpine air. At first glance, Boulder seemed dreamily pleasant, as clean and orderly as a Swiss resort, but not exactly in bohemian ferment.On the tidy Pearl Street Mall, crowds were gathered by burbling fountains to watch buskers, jugglers and flame-swallowers. Uplifting mountain views framed every corner. The bike lanes were so perfectly drawn they qualified as site-specific sculptures. In fact, everyone was so cheerful, healthy and fresh-faced that I had to fight the urge to flee back to Manhattan.The Chautauqua\u2019s once-austere teetotaling regimen has clearly loosened up. When I arrived, the historic concert hall had been taken over by Ziggy Marley and his band. The air vents had been opened for the warm summer night, so the strains of reggae wafted from the auditorium across the landscaped grounds, accompanied by a sweet miasma of legalized marijuana from hundreds of Boulderites picnicking and sipping wine beneath the stars.In the spirit of improving both mind and body, I went hiking the next morning with Carol Taylor, a local historian, newspaper columnist and program manager for the Chautauqua. We followed a trail into the Flatirons, soaring triangular crags that were named for their resemblance to Victorian-era clothing irons. As sweat-soaked fitness devotees jogged past lugging backpacks filled with rocks, Ms. Taylor engaged me in a mobile history lecture, explaining that Boulder\u2019s current status as a perpetual contender for \u201cAmerica\u2019s most livable town\u201d was the result of a century and a half\u2019s worth of efforts to imbue its idyllic setting with intellectual cachet.Boulderites gave land and cash in the 1870s to establish the University of Colorado, then donated Chautauqua\u2019s choice site to lure creative celebrities. In 1908, they even hired the renowned landscaper Frederick Law Olmsted Jr., son of the designer of Central Park in New York, for aesthetic advice. He recommended they plant more trees \u2014 the mountains were barren then \u2014 and clean the refuse-strewn Boulder Creek.Soon after, a boosterish collection of poems by William O. Wise, \u201cBoulder the Beautiful,\u201d complete with promotional photos of the area, anointed Boulder the \u201cAthens of the West,\u201d a cultural beacon for the Rockies. (The lofty title has also been claimed by several other cities, including Cleveland and Louisville, Ky.).\u201cCan you imagine if this place was concreted over?\u201d Ms. Taylor mused as we took in the fairy-tale beauty of the valley, carpeted with colored wildflowers and exploding with clouds of butterflies.I decided to settle into a regimen. Like genteel Edwardian travelers of a century ago, I cleared my city lungs every morning with a wilderness jaunt \u2014 one day mountain biking the Switzerland Trail, a 20-mile former railroad track through gold mining ghost towns; the next day inner-tubing down Boulder Creek. Then, in the heat of the afternoon, I sought out the cultural attractions, following the advice of writers who congregate here, creating their own literary enclave in the West.It\u2019s hard to remember that until the late 1960s, Boulder was still a sober, conservative and pious place. (It remained \u201cdry\u201d until 1967.) Its image changed almost overnight when university students became radicalized, hippies and antinuclear demonstrators arrived from around the country, and a progressive City Council voted in the town\u2019s first (and last) African-American mayor. Suddenly, Boulder was a countercultural mecca.But the most intimate shrine turned out to be Ginsberg\u2019s long-term residence, which I tracked down in the quiet back blocks of the town. Stone steps led up from a sleepy lane to a quaint cottage with a \u201cBernie for President\u201d sign in the window. The current owners, Steve and Jennifer Hendricks, welcomed me in for iced tea.They admitted that they had known nothing of Ginsberg\u2019s life here before moving in five years ago. \u201cWe do get a few poetry fans every year,\u201d Mr. Hendricks said. \u201cNot many.\u201d The interior of the house had been renovated, they said, but its exterior has barely changed since the glory days.

It also says that cellphone makers are free to use Android-based services provided by rivals. Google does not make money directly from licensing the mobile operating system to companies, but it takes a cut from advertisements displayed on online searches.The Indian officials suggested that the company was abusing its dominant market position by ranking its services ahead of those of competitors in Google search, according to people with knowledge of the report, which has not been made public.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Once Taunted by Steve Jobs, Companies Are Now Big Customers of Apple", "Date": "2016-08-07", "News": "Supported byThese days, the same could be said about Apple. Even IBM is promoting Apple gear.Apple\u2019s iPhones and iPads have become the preferred mobile computing devices for corporations, as industries from insurers to airlines aim to ditch bulky PCs and give their employees the ability to do their jobs from anywhere using smartphones or tablets.\u201cApple is stronger in the enterprise market with its devices than it is with consumers,\u201d said Frank Gillett, an industry analyst at Forrester.Pinpointing exact figures for Apple\u2019s corporate sales is difficult. Apple said growth was strong but declined to disclose recent numbers. During its last fiscal year, which ended in September, Apple said it sold $25 billion in gear and services to companies and other large customers. While that was only about 11 percent of the company\u2019s overall revenue, those business sales were up 40 percent from the previous year. That\u2019s compared with 28 percent growth for the entire business.Companies are turning to Apple\u2019s products for their tight-knit hardware and software, advanced security features and intuitive interfaces. Aiding Apple\u2019s corporate sales has been a concern that phones and tablets running Google\u2019s Android software, which are generally cheaper and popular with consumers, have lagged in the security technology and the standardization that companies want.For British Airways, which has built more than 40 custom iPad apps for its work force, switching to tablets has eliminated reams of paper used for flight plans, passenger manifests and maintenance records. Another app allows anyone at the airline to grab an iPad and quickly rebook passengers when a flight is canceled or weather wreaks havoc on schedules.\u201cWe can get to customers wherever they are,\u201d said Abigail Comber, who is in charge of the customer experience at the airline. \u201cIt\u2019s technology that\u2019s very intuitive. What the team has managed to do brilliantly is take away everything that happens on the back end.\u201d The carrier has so far deployed its apps across 17,000 iPads, and is looking to digitize even more of its business.Apple says it is focused on creating great devices \u2014 for all customers. \u201cWe\u2019re dedicated to building products that make people\u2019s lives better, often in ways that we couldn\u2019t have even imagined, enabling them to do things that they have never done before,\u201d Susan Prescott, vice president of worldwide product marketing, markets and applications, said in a statement. \u201cOur goal with business customers is the same \u2014 to enable them to do something great with mobile and truly modernize and transform their business.\u201dApple\u2019s increased attention to business customers has not come without internal angst.\u201cApple totally recognizes that their products are being used in a workplace context and not just at home,\u201d Mr. Gillett said. \u201cBut they are rabidly focused on making the world better for individual users. They have a strong fear if they begin to think too much about their enterprise customers, they will compromise the consumer experience.\u201dApple runs three-day boot camps for companies at its campus in Cupertino, Calif., to help them rapidly build prototype apps. But it was not an approach that could be scaled up to thousands of corporate customers.Hence Apple\u2019s decision to team up with other companies that specialize in catering to businesses. As Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, quipped at an industry conference last September: \u201cLife is short. We\u2019re going to die soon. And you\u2019ve got to have as many friends as you can.\u201dMahmoud Naghshineh, IBM\u2019s general manager for the Apple partnership, says Apple\u2019s devices appeal to companies that need to manage complex processes. IBM\u2019s strategy is to develop apps for specific industries, then customize them for each customer.Claims adjusters at Amica Mutual Insurance, for example, recently began using an IBM iPad app to collect information on claims, take photos, record statements and gain access to individual customer files. \u201cThe adjuster in the future will be able to complete their entire job on the iPad,\u201d said Adam Kostecki, an Amica manager involved in the project.Many companies are forging ahead on their own. Lowe\u2019s, the home improvement retailer, has built five iPod apps. One allows store employees to pull up reviews with 360-degree views of products, check inventory and guide customers to the exact location of a product within its warehouse-size outlets.Other apps allow employees to match a carpet pattern and estimate how much a customer would need to cover a given area. Inspired by the iPhone-based checkout system at Apple stores, Lowe\u2019s has even written a checkout app that it is testing in its two Manhattan stores.\u201cIf you think about devices that a lot of retailers provide to their associates, they aren\u2019t user-friendly. They are sometimes very old technology,\u201d said Eric Hanson, the director of digital experience at Lowe\u2019s. \u201cOur associates were deserving of an experience that was the same as we gave to our customers.\u201dVan Baker, an analyst at the Gartner research firm who studies mobile technology in businesses, said that most companies are just beginning to explore how mobile devices can transform their businesses. \u201cFor the vast majority of enterprises, mobile usage extends to email, contacts and calendars,\u201d he said.That opens up opportunities that Apple is cautiously pursuing.\u201cCook has taken a pragmatic approach without changing Apple\u2019s culture,\u201d Mr. Gillett, the Forrester analyst, said. Apple\u2019s philosophy, he said, is, \u201cWe want to stick to our knitting, what we\u2019re really good at \u2014 devices and software experiences for individuals \u2014 and work with others to translate Apple\u2019s strengths into the workplace.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Google appears to have used that feedback heavily in the final version.What\u2019s the single best question about money that anyone has ever asked you \u2014 or that you\u2019ve asked of a spouse, family member or loved one? And what was the conversation that ensued?Not so long ago, a new computer OS was a huge deal, developed in secret and released with a marketing thunderclap. That was when personal computers were the rule, or PC-type thinking dominated phone marketing. Now speed, feedback and continuous upgrades are the rule.Nougat will appear as an update on a handful of Nexus phones over the next few weeks, and later on a new phone. It is said to have 250 new features, but is unlikely to require a lot of new learning, unlike new versions of Windows on a PC.People don\u2019t have time for that now; if things aren\u2019t more intuitive, they are discarded.Personalization is also a big feature of these mass-market devices, so the phone can do things like provide polyglots with search results in multiple languages, ways to reconfigure Quick Settings controls or 1,500 different emoji for nonverbal communication.Besides feedback and customization, speed is another design principle that has become paramount. Apps can run side by side, notifications can open apps directly and previously used apps can be easily reopened.If saving seconds sounds like a big deal, it is: Google long ago discovered that even a 200-millisecond delay can make a search seem too slow. That impatience is now a consumer norm.So much for the present state of tech design.

{"Headline": "Endorsed on Instagram by a Kardashian, but Is It Love or Just an Ad?", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "Supported byThe millions of people who follow Kim Kardashian West and her sisters on social media have become accustomed to seeing them praise everything from fat-burning tea to gummy vitamins for healthier hair.But in the last week, close watchers of the sisters\u2019 accounts may have noticed a small addition to those laudatory messages about the latest miracle product: \u201c#ad.\u201dFor marketers contending with consumers who use ad blockers online and have cut the cord to their TVs in favor of streaming services, social media has become a way to reach an elusive audience. Brands such as Jack in the Box and Red Bull have proved willing to pay thousands of dollars per social media mention to people like the Kardashians and other so-called influencers who command big, loyal followings on services like Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube.These mentions, however, are often presented as testimonials rather than advertisements, a practice that at least one consumer advocacy group has claimed is deceptive. And the Federal Trade Commission has found itself struggling to articulate exactly how these sorts of paid brand endorsements should be handled to ensure that they are identified as ads.\u201cWe\u2019re not prescriptive about that,\u201d said Mary K. Engle, the F.T.C.\u2019s associate director for advertising practices. \u201cBut it has to be unambiguous.\u201dFor example, simply saying \u201cthank you\u201d to a brand or adding \u201c#sp\u201d or \u201c#spon\u201d probably isn\u2019t clear enough, while saying a brand is a \u201cpartner\u201d probably is, she said.The gray area was on display last week when Kylie Jenner changed a caption on an Instagram picture of a lavish mansion in Turks and Caicos from \u201cThanks for the birthday home, @airbnb\u201d to \u201cThanks for the gift of a lovely birthday home, @airbnb.\u201d After a lawyer for the sisters received an Aug. 17 letter from TruthinAdvertising.org, they also edited the captions on at least a dozen other Instagram photos and deleted others.Michael Kump, a lawyer for the sisters, confirmed on Wednesday that he was talking with TruthinAdvertising.org.Audiences \u201chave a very visceral reaction to \u2018#ad\u2019 or \u2018#spon\u2019 or whatever it is, where they don\u2019t want to know people are getting paid for stuff even if they are,\u201d said Jaclyn Johnson, president of creative services at Small Girls PR, where she connects brands like L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris and Urban Decay cosmetics to influencers who have large social media followings. \u201cA few bloggers we work with say, \u2018I want you to know, my engagement on posts that are tagged \u201c#ad\u201d or \u201c#spon\u201d get lower engagement than if that wasn\u2019t there.\u2019\u201dBrands are \u201ctoeing this line of how to make it come across as authentic but also in line with the legalese of social media endorsements,\u201d Ms. Johnson added.The company has counted more than 200,000 Instagram posts a month since January tagged with \u201c#ad,\u201d \u201c#sp\u201d or \u201c#sponsored\u201d \u2014 and that does not include those that were not properly marked. Any one brand could be working with thousands of influencers, said Ms. Engle of the F.T.C., and most are not reality television stars.\u201cMost of them are just more or less regular people,\u201d she said.Shaun McBride, a 29-year-old who is known as Shonduras on social media, has worked with companies like Google and Red Bull on campaigns on Snapchat, where he said he had about 700,000 followers. His posts feature him doing activities like skateboarding and launching homemade rockets, as well as photos of his infant daughter and cereal.For top Snapchat users, brands will start rates \u201cat around $10,000\u201d for a story, he said, referring to a collection of images and videos that disappear after 24 hours. He said he did at least five of those a month.\u201cAll brands have always been worried about the F.T.C. guidelines, but I definitely think they\u2019re focusing on it more,\u201d Mr. McBride said. \u201cRecently, it\u2019s like, \u2018Can you have \u2018#sponsored\u2019 on the first snap and the last snap?\u2019 Or \u2018Can you put \u2018#ad\u2019 on every single snap in the corner?\u2019\u201dThat makes Mr. McBride even more inclined to make paid posts \u201cvery, very obvious.\u201d That could, for instance, mean thanking Red Bull for a free trip to Hawaii. Otherwise, posts with \u201c#ad\u201d or \u201c#sponsored\u201d can give his followers an \u201cuncomfortable feeling,\u201d he said.Disclosures can also be complicated as brands increasingly give creative leeway to social media stars. Jack in the Box, for example, told investors and analysts in May about its work with the YouTube star Miranda Sings, who created a passionate serenade for one of its hamburgers called \u201cSexy Buttery Love Song.\u201d It surpassed a million views, and she later performed it in concert, executives told the investors and analysts.Her YouTube post description includes a line that says, \u201cThis video is sponsored by Jack in the Box,\u201d and that same line appears in the corner of her video after the two-minute mark.\u201cIt would definitely be awesome to see specific examples on every single platform so you don\u2019t have issues like the Warner Bros. one,\u201d said Krishna Subramanian, a founder of Captiv8. \u201cIf there were very clear definitions of what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong, then we as an industry could embrace it and help move things forward.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Every Company Is a Tech Company, Does the Label Matter?", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "Supported byStrategiesApple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon have created something of a watershed moment in the stock market.They became the four most valuable companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index at the close of trading on Aug. 1, according to S.&P.\u2019s official tally. That meant that tech companies, by one common definition, occupied the four top spots in the market capitalization rankings, a rare and brief occurrence.\u201cIt may never have happened before at the close of trading,\u201d said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. The full history of daily rankings isn\u2019t readily available, however, so we can\u2019t be certain, and such rankings are evanescent, shifting with every tick of the stock market. In fact, on Friday, Amazon dropped back into sixth place.But no matter: The early August rankings were a reminder of how far tech has come. It is a dominant force in the stock market and the economy, one so all-encompassing that tech may no longer even be a useful concept for understanding today\u2019s stock market.One of them is Exxon Mobil, the energy giant and the most valuable company in the S.&P. as recently as 2012. But Exxon Mobil has been cut down in size by the oil price debacle. The other is Berkshire Hathaway, Warren E. Buffett\u2019s conglomerate, which the S.&P. categorizes as a financial services company \u2014 the only such company left in the Top 10 market cap list. Berkshire announced its own earnings after trading closed on Friday. We\u2019ll soon learn whether the market is pleased enough to vault Berkshire further ahead of Amazon.The three tech companies at the very top in market cap \u2014 Apple, Google and Microsoft \u2014 have held high positions for a long while. (Google, ranked second, trades as Alphabet, the name of its parent company.) Google passed Apple in value briefly this year, but Apple regained the top perch, which it has held since 2012. Microsoft, now No. 3, was the most valuable company during the last tech boom, in the early 2000s.Virtually no one disputes S.&P.\u2019s formal classification of Apple, Google and Microsoft as \u201cinformation technology\u201d companies. The same is true of Facebook, which held seventh place in the latest list of most valuable companies. But while Amazon is often described as a tech company \u2014 and undoubtedly uses and creates innovative technology \u2014 S.&P. has never classified it as one.In fact, Amazon is formally known as a \u201cconsumer discretionary company,\u201d like Walmart, which it has displaced as a member of the Top 10 most valuable companies. Amazon is the only consumer discretionary company left in the Top 10. Is it in some sense a tech company? Certainly, and we\u2019ll get back to that.But the same can be said, to one degree or another, about the three other members of the Top 10 \u2014 old companies that are still prospering in large part because of their mastery of advanced technologies. Johnson & Johnson, for example, which is ranked eighth, is a health care company, yet it is heavily involved in technology of a biological kind. Then there is General Electric, the diversified industrial company (and, until recently, also a financial services company), once described as a bellwether for the entire market. It conducts advanced research and sells tech products.Last on the list is AT&T, a telecommunications company, which, in an early form, helped create computer languages and operating systems on which modern tech companies are built. In 1957, when the S.&P. 500 was born, an ancestral version of AT&T was the most valuable company in the United States by a very wide margin, said Jeremy J. Siegel, a Wharton business school professor, the author of \u201cStocks for the Long Run\u201d and a market historian.\u201cAT&T back then was a highly regulated old phone company,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a giant, later broken up into smaller companies. And it was an outlier, because the other big companies in the S.&P. 500 in that era were mainly materials companies \u2014 like United States Steel, DuPont and Union Carbide \u2014 and an awful lot of oil companies.\u201dIn 1957, the economy ran on oil, and the biggest energy company was Standard Oil of New Jersey \u2014 an ancestor of Exxon Mobil. No pure tech company ranked in the Top 10 back then, not even IBM, which soon became the dominant tech company, a position it held until Microsoft surpassed it in the mid-1990s. That was the decade of the great tech boom, culminating in the bubble that burst in March 2000. Microsoft was No. 1 in market cap at the end of 1999, and four other tech companies \u2014 Cisco Systems, Intel, IBM and America Online \u2014 were also among the Top 10 most valuable companies. The stock market celebrated tech\u2019s ascendance then, as it does now.But this is a different era. When you dig deeper into the S.&P. 500, it\u2019s clear that while the valuations of tech companies swelled to unrealistically high proportions in those bubble years, the valuations of most companies are far more modest now. In March 2000, the height of the bubble, the value of information technology companies swelled to 34.5 percent of the total market cap of the S.&P. 500. At the moment, the comparable figure is only 20.7 percent, data from the Bespoke Investment Group shows. That\u2019s not much more than the 15.7 percent share of financial companies or the 15.2 percent share of the health care sector. By contrast, finance ballooned as high as 22.3 percent at the end of 2006, in what can be seen in hindsight as a financial bubble.On the other hand, materials and energy companies, which together constituted almost half of the total value of the S.&P. 500 in 1957, now account for less than 10 percent of it. That reflects the collapse of energy and commodity prices over the last few years, and it may well be a temporary phenomenon. In the meantime, diversified energy companies like Exxon Mobil are investing heavily in technology, a necessity if they are to flourish.It\u2019s clear even to energy companies, in other words, that tech\u2019s abiding power in the marketplace is not temporary. Technology permeates every sector of the economy, even those not formally classified as high-tech. Whether companies like Amazon and Johnson & Johnson should carry tech labels is beside the point. Tech has already taken over.These days every company is a tech company, but some have better niches, faster growth, more attractive offerings or more favorable share prices than others. These kinds of fundamental distinctions will influence the Top 10 rankings of the future.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

I know that it had me snorting all the way through.Today\u2019s three theme clues at 17-, 36- and 53A might seem kind of stretchy, but they actually describe the goings-on in the theme pretty well.If you take a fairly long word like RECONSIDERATION (17A) and slice it up into three parts, what you wind up with (that still makes sense) is RECON SIDE RATION. That sums up \u201cNot the main food allotment for one on an intel mission?\u201d Now you slice up the other two theme entries, and you should wind of with a set of the following:17A: RECONSIDERATION = RECON SIDE RATION [\u201cNot the main food allotment for one on an intel mission?\u201d]36A: TEMPERAMENTALLY = TEMPE RAMEN TALLY [\u201cNoodle count in one of Arizona\u2019s largest cities?\u201d]53A: NONCOMMUNICABLE = NONCOM MUNI CABLE [\u201cSarge\u2019s \u2018Sell my city bonds!\u2019 telegram?\u201d]As I would have expected from a Lewis-Chen puzzle, there is a lot of good stuff in the puzzle outside the theme. The constructors introduced eight entries today (including two of the theme entries) and, in non-debut news, I liked IDRIS Elba, MYST, LOOK IT UP, DAILY PLANET, SPRAY TAN, BLIND ALLEYS, SURE DO, WET MARTINIS (I like them any way I can get them), HONEYMOONED and ROSHAMBO.\u2022 10A: Remember: Abbreviated clue means an abbreviated entry, so \u201cCorp. recruiters\u2019 targets\u201d would be M.B.A.S.\u2022 15A: One of the founders of the NAACP was a suffragist and civil rights activist named Mary White Ovington. Ms. Ovington grew up in a family that supported women\u2019s rights and had been part of the antislavery movement. When I first solved this, I wished that the clue had credited one of the black founders, like W.E.B. DuBois, but Mr. DuBois has been used in clues a number of times. My best guess about this is that an attempt was made to come up with a fresh clue.\u202222A: I have this theory that for every moment in life there is an equivalent \u201cSeinfeld\u201d moment, so I truly wanted the answer to \u201cLike the cinnamon in babka\u201d this to be LESSER, as in \u201clesser babka\u201d:\u2022 2D: Hands up if you had RAH before OL\u00c9 for the \u201cTwo-syllable cheer.\u201d\u2022 24D: I loved this clue. \u201cDid a tour after joining up?\u201d sounds like someone enlisted in the military, but we\u2019ve been misdirected: you can also join up in wedded bliss and go on your honeymoon.\u2022 27D: More misdirection! \u201cBiblical mount\u201d suggests a mountain like Ararat, but today we\u2019re thinking about mounts that someone can ride, like a CAMEL.\u2022 56D: I stared at this one for a while before I understood why the answer to \u201cBe on the level?\u201d is LIE. I\u2019m thinking that if you\u2019re lying down (horizontal), you\u2019re basically level. What do you think?We each took a crack at finding 15-letter words that could be split into 5/5/5 or 4/5/6 or 4/4/7. After sifting through a bunch of junk, we settled on these three. Here are a few alternates that didn\u2019t quite make the cut:HYPER/CRITIC/ALLYINTER/MEDIA/TINGTOUGH/MINDED/NESSLIEU/TENANTS/HIPSAPP/RENT/ICES/HIPSSTAND/OF/FISH/NESSThe first version we submitted included the revealer THE SPLITS clued as [Show of flexibility ... and what 16\u2212, 25\u2212, and 40\u2212Across each do]. It was deemed to be not such a great addition to the main theme so we decided to rework the puzzle. With only three theme entries, we tried to construct a wide-open grid with as much fresh fill as possible. Hope you all enjoy the result.And, as many others have said, it\u2019s a great pleasure to work with Jeff!Both of us are recreational programmers (me much hackier than Parker, who actually works in the field). It occurred to me that his TEMPE/RAMEN/TALLY seed idea might be a fun project to expand my coding skills, and after a few attempts, I figured out a way to at least narrow down my list into a subset that might be reasonably human-scannable.Et voila, the other two popped out! (After about 10 hours of line-by-line searching.) HYPER CRITIC ALLY was also a possibility, but it wasn\u2019t nearly as nice, as it didn\u2019t change the \u201ccritic\u201d meaning at all.To the credit of Parker and his programming skills, he came up with these ... and a bunch of others (mentioned above).

Instead, most of its weight is supported on three buoyant concrete boxes, called caissons, anchored permanently below the water line.A visit to the middle caisson this summer opened my eyes to a world I could not have imagined out in the Hudson River. Though the caissons are submerged, they can be reached by stairs down shaftways through the pier shed deck.Squared-off columns and massive beams form an underwater hypostyle hall that is at once claustrophobic \u2014 dank, close and cool \u2014 and yet seemingly limitless. Space stretches away from the puny pool of a smartphone flashlight into echoing, fathomless darkness.When the caissons were finished, water was piped back into the basin and the caissons floated upward.How?Water has a density of 1 gram per cubic centimeter, or 62 pounds per cubic foot. Solid concrete would sink but the caissons are hollow boxes. Even though the larger ones weigh 27,000 tons, they displace about 47,000 tons of water, far more than their own weight.\"The density of the total volume \u2014 air plus concrete \u2014 is less than the density of the equivalent volume of water,\u201d said Gregory J.

Even more than that, a diverse work force can help them come up with new ideas that may not have occurred to 20-something Stanford bros.One would hope this doesn\u2019t happen again, but this is tech: anything goes, however terrible.On that note, have a good weekend, friend!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Edward Snowden\u2019s Long, Strange Journey to Hollywood", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "FeatureOliver Stone wanted a hit \u2014 and the chance to put America\u2019s most iconic dissident onscreen. The subject wanted veto power. The Russian lawyer wanted someone to option the novel he\u2019d written. The American lawyer just wanted the whole insane project to go away. Somehow a film got made.Supported by\u201cI think we should move,\u201d he said. His producer, Moritz Borman, led the way to another corner. \u201cHow\u2019s this?\u201d Borman asked.Stone didn\u2019t answer. He eyed an older couple slurping soup and kept moving. A moment later, Stone finally settled in by a window, comfortably beyond earshot of the other patrons.Such security precautions had become routine. Ever since Stone decided to make a biopic about Edward Snowden, the American whistle-\u00adblower currently holed up in Moscow somewhere, the director \u2014 who became a Buddhist while making \u201cHeaven & Earth\u201d and sampled a buffet of psychedelic drugs for \u201cThe Doors\u201d \u2014 had gone all method again. On \u201cSnowden,\u201d he and Borman became so preoccupied with American government surveillance that they had their Los Angeles offices swept for bugs more than once.The director hadn\u2019t been sleeping well. Principal photography wrapped a month earlier, and now Stone had come to Moscow to film Snowden for the movie\u2019s grand finale. He ordered a decaf coffee and began to lay out the events that led him and Borman to be hanging out in Russian hotels, on the lookout for potential spies. \u201cLast January, Moritz calls me,\u201d Stone said. \u201cHe says: \u2018You got a call from this fella who represents Mr. Snowden. You\u2019re invited to Moscow.\u2019\u2009\u201dThe call had come from Anatoly Kucherena, Snowden\u2019s Russian lawyer. In the course of his career, Kucherena has represented Russian oligarchs, film directors, a few pop singers and a state minister. In 2012, he campaigned for Vladimir V. Putin, and soon after Snowden landed in Moscow, Kucherena showed up at Sheremetyevo Airport and offered his services. Then Kucherena wrote a novel about his new client. Titled \u201cTime of the Octopus,\u201d it follows a National Security Agency leaker named Joshua Cold who is marooned in the airport and the Russian advocate who liberates him. In January 2014, months before the book was published, Kucherena called Borman to see if Stone might like to make it into a Hollywood movie.\u201cAnd I know you from working on, what, three films?\u201d Stone said at the bar.\u201cFive,\u201d Borman said.At the time, Stone and Borman were barely speaking after a falling-\u00adout during the making of \u201cSavages,\u201d a beachy Blake Lively thriller. \u201cWe\u2019ve had our fights,\u201d Stone said. \u201cYou know, he\u2019s German; I\u2019m American.\u201d He didn\u2019t elaborate.\u201cHe calls, and I go: \u2018Oh, [expletive]. Not again,\u2019\u2009\u201d Stone continued. It wasn\u2019t just about Borman. Stone wanted nothing to do with another political docudrama. He spent two decades trying to get a biopic about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. off the ground, only to see \u201cSelma\u201d get made to critical acclaim. Then there was the My Lai massacre film. Merrill Lynch put up cash, Bruce Willis was set to star and Stone built an entire village in Thailand. As the economy collapsed in 2008, the financing evaporated. \u201cYou get these scars, and they don\u2019t go away,\u201d Stone said.So Stone was skeptical. But this was Snowden, who single-\u00adhandedly exposed the colossal scale on which the United States had been surveilling its citizens. Plus, the director needed a hit. After early successes like \u201cPlatoon\u201d and \u201cWall Street,\u201d his more recent films didn\u2019t receive the attention he hoped. The Snowden story had all the ingredients of an epic Stone picture: politics, government conspiracy and, at the center of it all, an American patriot who had lost faith. If it panned out, it could be Stone\u2019s millennial follow-\u00adup to \u201cBorn on the Fourth of July,\u201d the Ron Kovic biopic that won him an Oscar in 1990.But first Stone and Borman had to make sure Kucherena was for real. Borman asked the lawyer to send the book and two first-class tickets to Moscow. Both arrived the next day. In case they still had doubts, Kucherena\u2019s office gave Borman a number to call. On the other end was an employee of the Russian consulate in San Francisco, who turned out to be a big fan of \u201cThe Life of David Gale,\u201d a film Borman produced. They were issued visas that same week. (Kucherena denies buying first-class tickets for Stone and Borman or helping expedite their visas.)\u201cWhen that happened,\u201d Borman said, \u201cI thought, O.K., I guess Kucherena can pull the strings.\u201dThe initial revelations were sensational. Not only had the N.S.A. been monitoring the calls, emails and web activity of millions of Americans, but it also had been tapping into the networks of Google, Yahoo and other companies to do so. The Guardian published the leaks, and Greenwald eventually revealed the identity of his source in a video shot by Poitras. Depending on your feelings about national security, the N.S.A.\u2019s actions were either necessary or unconstitutional. The Apple co-\u00adfounder Steve Wozniak called Snowden a hero. Secretary of State John Kerry called him a traitor. Donald Trump called for his execution.As Snowden became a celebrity, a cause and a historical event, the web of people who wanted to take part in it widened. Most had his best interests in mind, but his story also happened to advance agendas that had long needed an appealing spokesperson. Civil-\u00adliberties lawyers wanted to represent him. Activist journalists wanted access to him. Publishers rushed out books, including \u201cThe Snowden Files: The Inside Story of the World\u2019s Most Wanted Man,\u201d by Luke Harding of The Guardian, and \u201cThe Snowden Operation: Inside the West\u2019s Greatest Intelligence Disaster,\u201d by Edward Lucas of The Economist. Despite promising an \u201cinside\u201d look, neither writer had ever met Snowden.Those with intimate knowledge documented the experience, too. In 2014, Greenwald published \u201cNo Place to Hide: Edward Snowden, the N.S.A. and the U.S. Surveillance State,\u201d a dramatic retelling of how Greenwald broke the story. That fall, Poitras released \u201cCitizenfour,\u201d a tense and spooky documentary about a modest and intelligent young man who hid under a blanket when typing on his laptop. (It won the 2015 Oscar for best documentary.)Snowden, meanwhile, ended up in Russia. He had embarked on a trip to Ecuador, but the United States revoked his passport midflight, leaving him stranded in Moscow. For Russia, Snowden was like a bird that flew in through an open window \u2014 or, as Putin joked, an unwanted Christmas present. But politically speaking, he could be useful. After enduring the United States\u2019 endless lectures about human rights, the Kremlin could suddenly welcome a man who exposed large-scale American hypocrisy.Kucherena entered the picture as Snowden\u2019s lifeline, or at least as someone who could help him navigate Russia\u2019s asylum laws. An experienced lawyer, Kucherena was appointed by Putin to the Public Council, overseeing the Federal Security Service (F.S.B.). Snowden\u2019s case presented a new opportunity. It took Kucherena a month to negotiate Snowden\u2019s stay and three months to write \u201cTime of the Octopus.\u201dStone\u2019s first meeting with Kucherena was a disaster. (\u201cI thought he was a gruff bear,\u201d Stone told me.) The director wanted to meet Snowden, but Kucherena said Snowden wouldn\u2019t meet them until they agreed to option \u201cTime of the Octopus.\u201d (Kucherena denies this.) According to Stone and Borman, by the end of a long weekend, they reached a gentlemen\u2019s agreement: Stone would option the novel \u2014 if Kucherena could provide regular access to his client.During those 24 hours, this magazine had contacted Ben Wizner, Snowden\u2019s lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union, to arrange an interview with his client. Kucherena may be Snowden\u2019s Russian representative, but in the United States, Wizner runs the show. Wizner was furious. Not just because Stone had invited a reporter to Moscow, but because of how it all looked: that Snowden was involved in a Hollywood movie and that the whole production was seemingly brokered by a lawyer with ties to the Kremlin. Borman would later tell me that we had waded into the sticky territory of Snowden\u2019s multiple emissaries. \u201cThere are two ways to access him: One is Kucherena and one is Wizner, and it\u2019s completely political,\u201d Borman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a political situation that goes way above your head.\u201dWhen Wizner and I finally got on the phone, he was in damage-\u00adcontrol mode. He told me that Snowden wasn\u2019t profiting from Stone\u2019s film in any way. \u201cOne hard-and-fast rule Ed always had was, I\u2019m not selling my life rights,\u201d Wizner said. Snowden\u2019s participation in a Hollywood movie would only fuel the claims of his critics \u2014 that he was a narcissist eager to cash in. That said, Stone\u2019s film would be seen by millions of people, which meant it could sway public opinion. \u201cWe were choosing between two bad options,\u201d Wizner said. \u201cHe could have stubbornly stayed completely at arm\u2019s length and had no input whatsoever. Or he could have some input and compromised the arm\u2019s-length relationship. And I didn\u2019t know how to advise him on that.\u201dAccording to Wizner, Snowden met with Stone only to make sure that the film told an accurate story. \u201cIt\u2019s been us walking this tightrope between clearly not having any formal connection to the project \u2014 not deriving any benefit from it \u2014 and also not wanting to just be completely helpless and, you know, see what Oliver Stone comes up with,\u201d Wizner said. Despite some initial discomfort, he was tentatively optimistic. \u201cMaybe it\u2019ll be good,\u201d Wizner added. \u201cYou know, Oliver Stone wrote \u2018Scarface.\u2019\u2009\u201dStill, Stone was heading to Moscow to film Snowden for an appearance in the movie, which could be seen as an endorsement. Fact-\u00adchecking is one thing, I said; a cameo is another. \u201cIt is, and I\u2019m not entirely comfortable with it,\u201d Wizner said.Wizner had negotiated veto control over any footage featuring Snowden in the film. After we spoke, the lawyer says he asked Borman to put that in writing. He also reiterated that if Stone took a reporter along, Snowden would not participate. Stone and I eventually reached a compromise: I wouldn\u2019t observe the shoot, but I could still come and meet Kucherena.A few days later, I met Stone in Moscow. The director, who is 69, has a forward-\u00adleaning gait and unruly eyebrows, so that he looks a bit like a bull that is always about to charge. He emerged from the hotel\u2019s elevator with a pained look on his face. It was drizzling, and Stone\u2019s hair, which is the color of dark shoe polish, was pointing laterally. \u201cI have some bad news,\u201d he said. \u201cI cannot deliver Anatoly.\u201d He had just seen Snowden, who had been in touch with Wizner and was very upset, Stone said. \u201cEd said he doesn\u2019t want Anatoly talking to you, and he said that very clearly,\u201d Stone added.I would spend the next few days camped out at the hotel. When Stone wasn\u2019t shooting, we would meet in the lobby bar as he continued to tell me about the making of his film.Soon after optioning Kucherena\u2019s novel, Stone had returned to Moscow with his co-\u00adwriter, Kieran Fitzgerald, a recent University of Texas M.F.A. graduate. Anticipating a homesick Snowden, Fitzgerald hauled over a duffel bag packed with the stuff of Americana dreams: Kraft macaroni and cheese, \u00adJell-O cups, Oreos, Pepperidge Farm cookies, Twizzlers, peanut butter, Spam, an Orioles baseball cap and a pair of Converse sneakers. \u201cIt was like delivering a care package to a kid at summer camp,\u201d Fitzgerald told me. He also slipped in a copy of \u201cThe Odyssey\u201d translated by his grandfather, Robert Fitzgerald. \u201cI thought it was appropriate, since Ed was on his own kind of odyssey trying to get home.\u201dSnowden and Stone had gotten off to a slow start. Snowden was squeamish about a movie being made about his life. Stone, in turn, said the film would be made with or without him. Fitzgerald says he played referee. \u201cOliver can be a bit of battering ram,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cHe\u2019s accustomed to hard men who need to be cracked, but that\u2019s not Edward Snowden. He\u2019s not an alpha-\u00admale type. He\u2019s a very sensitive mind. So I was there to say: \u2018Everything is going to be O.K. He\u2019s a good guy. It\u2019s going to be a good movie.\u2019\u2009\u201d Eventually, Snowden began to open up, answering questions about his childhood; his girlfriend, Lindsay Mills; and what he could about his work for the N.S.A.While Fitzgerald returned to Austin to work on the script, Stone set out to plant his flag in the Snowden story. In Hollywood, book options are the equivalent of calling dibs, and Stone had competition. In May 2014, Sony Pictures optioned Greenwald\u2019s \u201cNo Place to Hide.\u201d By June, Stone had announced that he acquired Kucherena\u2019s book and Harding\u2019s \u201cThe Snowden Files.\u201d The tactic worked. Sony got nervous. \u201cNow what?\u201d Amy Pascal, then Sony\u2019s co-\u00adchairwoman, wrote to another executive. (The email would be leaked during the Sony hack.) Pascal\u2019s colleague reminded her of the case of the dual Steve Jobs biopics \u2014 \u201cJobs,\u201d with Ashton Kutcher, might have come out first, but it was \u201cSteve Jobs,\u201d starring Michael Fassbender, that was the better film. Pascal wasn\u2019t convinced. \u201cOliver Stone is not Ashton Kutcher,\u201d she responded. She wrote to George Clooney to pique his interest in adapting Greenwald\u2019s book, but Clooney passed. \u201cStone will do a hatchet job on the movie, but it will still be the film of Snowden,\u201d he replied.For Stone, the impending Sony project was a call to arms. Fitzgerald cranked out a first draft of the script, and that fall Stone went out to studios with a budget of $50 million and a release date in December 2015. Each one turned it down, and Stone became convinced that the studios wanted to quash the project because of its controversial subject matter. \u201cThis is why corporations owning movie studios is not a good idea,\u201d he said.While Borman hustled to find independent financing, Stone dove into casting. For the lead, he chose Joseph Gordon-\u00adLevitt, the son of liberals from Sherman Oaks, Calif., and a former child actor who has retained a pleasingly boyish look. \u201cThere\u2019s an interesting blandness to him in the same way that Jimmy Stewart might\u2019ve been considered bland,\u201d Stone said. \u201cThere\u2019s a neutrality there, which allows him to grow on you.\u201d Shailene Woodley was cast to play Lindsay Mills, Zachary Quinto as Greenwald and Melissa Leo as Poitras.By early 2015, Borman and Stone had racked up several hundred thousand dollars in debt, but the money was still short. The shoot was ultimately delayed three weeks as the producer cobbled together European partners. In the United States, \u201cSnowden\u201d was picked up by Open Road Films, a small production company that had just put out \u201cJobs\u201d \u2014 the Kutcher version.\u201cIt was painful that we ended up with this independent distributor,\u201d Stone said.Borman offered that Open Road was not so independent anymore.\u201cI\u2019d never heard of it,\u201d Stone said, adding: \u201cI\u2019ve been there before, but not on this level and not at this age. So for me, it was very difficult personally.\u201dI had gotten my copy from Stone, who handed it to me with a disclaimer. \u201cNow, it\u2019s easy to take a shot at this,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, it wasn\u2019t the basis of the movie. But it\u2019s fun. I enjoyed reading it.\u201d\u201cTime of the Octopus\u201d takes place in a single night. The protagonist, Joshua Cold, is sequestered in a bunker at Sheremetyevo Airport, where his Russian lawyer keeps him company. The chapters alternate between their time-\u00adstamped conversations and those labeled as digital files (\u201cFile 004.wav\u201d), suggesting that they are the lawyer\u2019s transcribed recordings. The basic facts of Cold\u2019s case sound familiar, as do the character names: There are journalists named Boitras and Greywold and an organization called Mikileaks run by an Augusto Cassangie. For the most part, Cold and the lawyer sit and talk about life, quoting Laozi to each other. But there is also a distinctly post-\u00adSoviet tone to the novel, which reads both like a love letter to American culture \u2014 Steven Spielberg, B.B. King, \u201cThe Terminator,\u201d Penthouse magazine, Popeye, \u201cThe \u00adX-Files,\u201d Paul Newman, Bon Jovi, \u201cSpider-\u00adMan,\u201d \u201cBraveheart,\u201d Quentin Tarantino and Tupac Shakur are all mentioned \u2014 and a gleeful taunt to its government. \u201cNot only did [Cold] snap the beak of the American eagle,\u201d Kucherena writes, \u201cbut he also gave him a good kick and a very humiliating one, as if it was not a menacing predator but a rural hen.\u201dIn the bunker, Cold enjoys pizza and whiskey, but he is worried about American agents coming to retrieve him. \u201cBelieve me, Russia is not the worst option for you,\u201d the lawyer tells Cold. \u201cAnd you needn\u2019t regard us with such mistrust.\u201dOnce Cold is granted asylum, the propaganda is dialed up. \u201cI shall work in Russia and get an apartment!\u201d Cold announces. \u201cI thought I would spend the rest of my life in this underground prison.\u201d\u201cAs far as I know Mr. Putin, he is not one to change his mind easily,\u201d the lawyer assures him. \u201cAll will be O.K.\u201d The novel concludes with Cold vowing to learn to drink like the Russians, but the lawyer suggests he try Kvass instead, a fermented beverage made from rye bread. (\u201cIt is the Russian Coca-\u00adCola,\u201d the lawyer says.) Then they leave the bunker.\u201cWeird, huh?\u201d Fitzgerald said when I asked about the novel. In fact, few people associated with either Snowden or \u201cSnowden\u201d wanted to discuss it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say anything on the record about that book,\u201d Gordon-\u00adLevitt told me.According to WikiLeaks, Stone paid a million dollars for \u201cTime of the Octopus,\u201d which seemed like a hefty amount to pay for material that Stone admitted he had no plans of using. (That\u2019s the same figure Sony reportedly paid for the rights to \u201cEat, Pray, Love.\u201d) \u201cWe bought it because we did get good access to Ed,\u201d Stone explained. \u201cHe had to be brought along.\u201dDuring Stone\u2019s visits, Kucherena hosted the director at his favorite restaurants and at his dacha outside Moscow. \u201cThey had a kind of bromance,\u201d Fitzgerald told me. Photos from the trips look like vacation postcards, with Stone and Fitzgerald grinning in Red Army caps (a gift from Kucherena) and Fitzgerald and Gordon-\u00adLevitt posing for a selfie in front of St. Basil\u2019s Cathedral. While out in public, the group referred to Snowden as \u201cSasha,\u201d a nickname Kucherena had given him.Kucherena and I would eventually speak by phone. He said he wrote the novel because he had received calls from many \u201crepresentatives of Hollywood,\u201d writers and filmmakers. \u201cAt some point, I just thought to myself, Why don\u2019t I try to write the book?\u201d he said. I asked which writers and directors had called him. \u201cVery many people called me,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut I honestly don\u2019t remember their names now.\u201dThe lawyer was deeply troubled by the news media\u2019s insinuations that he is connected to the Kremlin. He pointed to several clients he has defended against the F.S.B., including Platon Obukhov, a writer accused of spying for Britain. \u201cI never had any kind of agreement with the Kremlin,\u201d he said. \u201cThey tried to say I\u2019m tied to the F.S.B., but that\u2019s complete nonsense, excuse me.\u201dKucherena said he was inspired by his favorite authors, who include Tom Clancy, Aldous Huxley and George Orwell. \u201cThe Octopus in my novel is, you can say, a direct offspring of Big Brother,\u201d he said. Like most writers of fiction, he was reluctant to discuss which parts of his book were based in reality. \u201cA person can only be open with someone he trusts,\u201d Kucherena said. \u201cAnd here, because he had no one else, it turned out that I took on the role of mother and father. Accordingly, we had confidential conversations of various sorts.\u201dHe did not see a conflict of interest in his writing the novel. \u201cI wrote an artistic book,\u201d Kucherena said. Because he represents Snowden pro bono, he never expected to capitalize on the relationship. \u201cI don\u2019t take any money from him,\u201d Kucherena said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any. So I wrote a book, yes, fine. So I got a little, as we say in Russian.\u201dDespite being the one to put the \u201cSnowden\u201d project into motion, Kucherena shied away from assuming any credit. \u201cI\u2019m very far from all that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just an advocate. Look at where I am and where Hollywood is!\u201dWizner, who is 45, has been at the A.C.L.U. since 2001. Before Snowden, he tried to bring several suits to increase oversight over the intelligence community. Wizner likes to say that he spent a decade banging his head against a wall, and then Snowden came along and brought that wall down. Snowden had not only revealed the scope of the surveillance apparatus, but also that top government officials routinely misled the public about it. Since becoming Snowden\u2019s advocate, Wizner has become a figure of not insignificant geopolitical importance. Those revelations have since formed a critical backdrop for legislative reforms, and there are few things that irritate Wizner more than claims that threaten to tarnish Snowden\u2019s character and their common cause.It would not be a stretch to say that for Wizner, Kucherena has become a bit of a liability. Since 2013, the Russian lawyer has announced that Snowden landed a job at a major Russian website \u2014 news that turned out to not be true \u2014 and has supplied the news media with photos of his client enjoying his new life in Russia, attending an opera at the Bolshoi Theater and cheerfully hugging a dog named Rick. (Rick later turned out to be the dog of one of Kucherena\u2019s friends.) Now Kucherena had sold a novel to Stone, making it seem as if the director had to pay a Russian fixer to have access to Snowden \u2014 or worse, that Snowden was somehow under the lock and key of the Russian authorities, lent to Stone for a Hollywood movie.Wizner\u2019s counterefforts in the United States have been successful. Former Attorney General Eric Holder, once a fierce critic, has acknowledged that Snowden performed \u201ca public service.\u201d President Obama has called for the reform of phone metadata collection, and last June, Congress passed the U.S.A. Freedom Act, a law that directly resulted from Snowden\u2019s leaks. Snowden has come to be seen as a levelheaded activist. According to Wizner, he leads a free existence in Russia, making appearances via live video and publishing op-eds against Russia\u2019s human rights violations. \u201cI think people are inclined to believe that Russia would never let him stay there unless he was paying for it in some way,\u201d Wizner said. \u201cBut it\u2019s just not true. Not only is he not cooperating, but he\u2019s actually being critical.\u201dWhen I asked Wizner about Kucherena\u2019s book, we were meeting at a cafe near his office in Lower Manhattan. \u201cMaybe you should just characterize my facial expression \u2014 \u2018He smirked,\u2019\u2009\u201d Wizner said. (Except that his smirk was mixed with a frown.)According to him, Snowden has not read Kucherena\u2019s book. \u201cThe thing is, Ed has much bigger fish to fry,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you had people calling for your assassination, you\u2019d be annoyed. If you were facing life in solitary confinement, you\u2019d be concerned. If someone wrote some book in Russia that no one is going to read, it doesn\u2019t register.\u201dWizner was reluctant to discuss Kucherena\u2019s role in Snowden\u2019s life, but he conceded that it was somewhat unorthodox. \u201cIt seems like the ethical rules governing the attorney-\u00adclient relationship may be somewhat different in Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be very unusual for a lawyer in a high-\u00adprofile case to provide exclusive photos of his client to newspapers or write an unauthorized book and sell it to Hollywood.\u201dKucherena and Wizner have never met. Whatever uneasiness there may be, Kucherena spoke warmly about his American counterpart. \u201cWe are on the same team!\u201d he told me. \u201cBen works in America, I work in Russia. If he wanted to write a book, I would have no problem.\u201d Wizner told me he has no plans to write a book about Snowden, fictional or otherwise.We had met in the lobby bar again, the day after he filmed Snowden, and the director was in better spirits. The shoot took place at Kucherena\u2019s dacha. The day went long. Stone\u2019s idea was to interview Snowden and capture an affecting moment that would give the film its dramatic ending. But the first takes were stiff. \u201cEd is used to answering questions on a level of intelligence,\u201d Stone said. \u201cBut I was interested in the emotional, which is difficult for him.\u201d Stone ended up doing nine takes. At one point, they took a break and went for a walk around Kucherena\u2019s property. By the end of the day, Stone decided that he had gotten Snowden to go as far as he was going to. \u201cHe was cooperative,\u201d Stone said. \u201cHe wanted to make it work. But as an actor \u2014 he\u2019s not used to that. I mean, he\u2019s not an actor. And I don\u2019t think he became one that day.\u201dTo make Snowden more comfortable, Stone worked with a minimal crew. Some were meeting the whistle-\u00adblower for the first time and still seemed a bit star-struck. \u201cSuddenly this little creature comes teetering in \u2014 so fragile, so lovely, such a charming, well-\u00adbehaved, beautiful little man,\u201d the cinematographer, Anthony Dod Mantle, told me. \u201cHe\u2019s like an old soul in a very young body. He\u2019s got fingers like violins.\u201d Filming Snowden reminded Mantle of shooting other men with outsize reputations and slight builds. \u201cIt\u2019s like Bono or Al Pacino,\u201d he added. \u201cThose guys are teeny-\u00adweenies. But if you isolate him into a frame, he can be as big as anybody else.\u201dMantle shot Danny Boyle\u2019s \u201cSlumdog Millionaire\u201d and \u201c127 Hours,\u201d but \u201cSnowden\u201d proved to be a special challenge. Convinced that making the film on American soil would be too risky, Stone decided to film in Germany, where Borman was able to score some tax subsidies. With roughly 140 script pages to shoot in 54 days, the crew sprinted from Munich to Washington, to Hawaii, to Hong Kong, and then back to Munich. Often, Mantle wouldn\u2019t get to see locations before he had to film in them. To cut costs, the suburbs of Munich had to stand in for rural Maryland and Virginia, with German extras cast as Americans. \u201cThank God the Germans act like Americans,\u201d Stone said.The production itself resembled a covert operation, with a code name (\u201cSasha\u201d had stuck) and elaborate security protocols. Worried that \u201cSasha\u201d would be of interest to the N.S.A., Borman and Stone avoided discussing production details by phone or email \u2014 \u201cIt was all handwritten notes and long walks in the park,\u201d Borman said \u2014 and kept the script on air-\u00adgapped computers, ones that have never been connected to the internet. If it had to be mailed, Borman would mix up the pages into four packages, which he would send with four different couriers to four different addresses. \u201cMaybe nobody gave a [expletive],\u201d Borman told me. \u201cOr maybe the N.S.A. is laughing at us like, \u2018Look at those idiots \u2014 of course we copied everything that came through DHL and FedEx!\u201dFor the actors, the frenetic schedule and paranoia on set added to the mood of the production. \u201cSnowden himself was in the midst of a stressful situation, so the fact that our shoot was a little bit that way, I think, helped,\u201d Gordon-\u00adLevitt said, before catching himself. \u201cMaking the movie was obviously a walk in the park compared to what he did. But just to have those little emotional touch points can help when you\u2019re acting.\u201dCommitted to inhabiting Snowden\u2019s robotic speech pattern, Gordon-\u00adLevitt lifted the audio from \u201cCitizenfour\u201d and played it on repeat while he slept. He also worried that some of the dialogue felt heavy-\u00adhanded. \u201cOliver is very into making his point,\u201d the actor said, \u201cas he should be. I really admire him for that. But I felt like it was my job to be like, \u2018O.K., I want to make the point, too, but this is a human being and not just a mouthpiece.\u201d Stone found Gordon-\u00adLevitt\u2019s approach too \u201cdocumentary-\u00adish\u201d at times. \u201cI was trying for the dramatic side as much as possible,\u201d Stone said. Fitzgerald was ultimately flown in to the set to execute last-\u00adminute rewrites.By late spring of 2015, Stone was close to wrapping when his mother, Jacqueline Goddet Stone, died at 93. She had called him in Munich, but Stone felt he couldn\u2019t risk leaving. \u201cTo go to L.A. would have cost us three down days,\u201d Stone told me. \u201cI knew she was going to pass, but I thought I could make it.\u201d Stone remained on set during the funeral and kept shooting.Stone\u2019s trip to Moscow to film the real Snowden was the last bit he needed to complete the film. But he was still worried \u2014 that the footage would be leaked, that critics would eviscerate it, that Snowden wouldn\u2019t like it. \u201cI want him to vet it,\u201d he said. He was heading to New York to begin editing and planned to return to Moscow at the end of the summer to show Snowden a rough cut. \u201cO.K., my dear,\u201d Stone said, getting up to leave. \u201cSee you in New York.\u201dThen he disappeared for six months.At the time, Stone wasn\u2019t interested, and Greenwald negotiated the deal with Sony. Stone later came back and offered to match Sony\u2019s bid, but Greenwald declined. \u201cI think he was a little perturbed,\u201d Greenwald said. Of the principal cast, Zachary Quinto, who plays Greenwald in Stone\u2019s movie, was the only actor who didn\u2019t meet his real-life counterpart as research. \u201cI always thought that was a little weird,\u201d Greenwald said. \u201cI think Oliver thought I had some competitive hostility toward his project, or he had some hostility \u2014 I\u2019m not really sure.\u201d (According to Stone, Quinto didn\u2019t need to meet Greenwald because there were so many videos of the journalist online.)In the spring of 2014, Stone flew to Berlin and met with Poitras. The meeting did not go well. According to Poitras, Stone proposed that she delay the release of \u201cCitizenfour,\u201d which she was then in the middle of editing, to time up with his film. \u201cBecause his film would be the real movie \u2014 because it\u2019s a Hollywood movie,\u201d Poitras told me. \u201cObviously I wasn\u2019t interested in doing that. To have another filmmaker ask me to delay the release of my film was \u2014 well, it was somewhat insulting.\u201dStone was annoyed, but he stuck around for a few drinks. They discussed new movies, including \u201c12 Years a Slave.\u201d As Poitras recalls, Stone found the film too violent, while Poitras thought the brutality was appropriate given the subject matter. Stone was growing increasingly frustrated. \u201cAt some point, he reached over and had his hands around my neck,\u201d Poitras said. \u201cIt was sort of in a joking way. I think he was a little bit drunk. But it was not a particularly pleasant evening.\u201dAccording to Stone, he only offered to help Poitras get distribution. \u201cWe thought we\u2019d help her either bring out her film with our film, or in the wake of it or before it, if we could,\u201d Stone said. He didn\u2019t recall pretending to strangle Poitras. \u201cI think from talking to her, you sense she\u2019s superparanoid,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I liked her,\u201d he continued. \u201cI admired her. I saw her films. I was trying to help her. If Laura is accusing me of trying to aggress her or kill her, she\u2019s crazy.\u201dStone\u2019s torment is at least in part self-\u00adinflicted. Biopics can be a nasty business, and Stone routinely throws himself into historical narratives and the messy negotiation between fact and fiction. The haggling with historians and family estates is the reason Stone was never able to make films about Martin Luther King Jr. and Hank Williams, and it was why he had to wait for Richard M. Nixon to die to make \u201cNixon.\u201d For Stone, the real-life characters of the stories he is after have become both the obstacles and the necessary arbiters of his work. It\u2019s why he refused to make \u201cSnowden\u201d without Snowden, and why his appeals to Greenwald and Poitras were his way of getting them on board.If Poitras had a strong reaction to Stone\u2019s proposal, it was because she had already been hounded by Sony. After the studio optioned Greenwald\u2019s book, Poitras says Sony asked to buy her life rights \u2014 an offer she declined. Sony suggested that she come on as a consultant, but when the contract arrived, it stipulated that the studio would have access to Poitras\u2019s tapes and notebooks. \u201cSo I\u2019d already gone through that when Oliver came in trying to position himself,\u201d she said.Poitras is a soft-\u00adspoken, cautious woman who has spent much of the past decade on government watch lists. Her resistance to participating in various Snowden projects has less to do with her feeling territorial than with her trying to maintain some control as she has become a character in a story that is no longer hers. Poitras\u2019s radical position is that the \u201cSnowden story\u201d can really belong only to Snowden. \u201cI could have asked him for a life-rights contract in Hong Kong, but I don\u2019t believe in that as a concept,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s his story, and I hope he tells it when he\u2019s ready.\u201dNeither Greenwald nor Poitras ultimately object to Stone making his film. While his own movie still lingered in development, Greenwald thought Snowden\u2019s story might in fact be safer in Stone\u2019s hands than it would be elsewhere. The Sony leaks would eventually reveal that Stone\u2019s paranoia may have been justified: In emails about the purchase of Greenwald\u2019s book, an executive in Sony\u2019s government-\u00adaffairs office suggests toning down the news release, changing \u201cillegal spying\u201d to \u201cintelligence gathering\u201d and \u201cmisuse of power\u201d to \u201cactions.\u201d\u201cMy big worry with Hollywood and the Snowden story is that they\u2019re either going to be cowards and completely drain it of its political vitality,\u201d Greenwald told me, \u201cor that they\u2019re going to do a superbiased smear job. For all the talk about how liberal Hollywood is, the reality is that they\u2019re really close to the government. And whatever other things you might say about Oliver, I was actually relieved that someone was going to do this film where there was no danger of those things happening.\u201dLike \u201cCitizenfour,\u201d \u201cSnowden\u201d takes place in Hong Kong, but this time the story has the eerie feeling of a familiar scene re-\u00adenacted by skilled Hollywood actors. Stone was right about Gordon-\u00adLevitt. His performance is not an interpretation so much as a direct replica of the whistle-\u00adblower\u2019s even demeanor and intonation. Quinto plays Greenwald with such intensity that he appears perpetually enraged. Melissa Leo\u2019s Poitras is in turn warm and protective, almost maternal.Stone came in just as the credits rolled. He was nursing a cold but was back on caffeine and asked his assistant for Bulletproof, the trendy coffee brand made with \u201cgrass-fed butter.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be nutritional,\u201d Stone said. \u201cNo radicals.\u201dSince I last saw him, the film\u2019s release had been pushed from December 2015 to May 2016 as Stone rushed to complete it, and then once more to September 2016. The biggest challenge was pacing. Stone likes to structure his movies around a series of plot-\u00adpivoting, battlelike scenes \u2014 the concerts in \u201cThe Doors,\u201d the football games in \u201cAny Given Sunday\u201d or actual warfare in \u201cAlexander.\u201d A story in which the drama hinges on a tech specialist downloading classified documents was more subdued than he was accustomed to. \u201cCoding is not exciting,\u201d Stone said. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s a nerdlike behavior \u2014 it\u2019s dull on a screen.\u201dStone got around the tedium of reality by turning his film into a cross between a cyberthriller and a love story, using Snowden\u2019s relationship with Mills to inject emotional stakes. Cutting between Snowden in Hong Kong and flashbacks to his past, the film speeds through Snowden\u2019s biography with the help of techno music, snappy explanations of N.S.A. programs and tricky camerawork to build in the tension of surveillance. (There are scenes filmed from the perspective of tiny phone cameras \u2014 the modern peephole \u2014 and suggestive zoom-ins on eye pupils.)But there are also unmistakable Stone-isms. \u201cI just don\u2019t really like bashing my country,\u201d Gordon-\u00adLevitt says to Woodley as they stroll past a Bush-\u00adera antiwar protest in front of the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s my country, too,\u201d Woodley says. \u201cAnd right now, it\u2019s got blood on its hands.\u201dSnowden\u2019s N.S.A. boss is unsubtly named Corbin O\u2019Brian, after the antagonist in Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984.\u201d \u201cMost Americans don\u2019t want freedom,\u201d O\u2019Brian tells Snowden. \u201cThey want security.\u201dSnowden\u2019s many storytellers all tell a similar hero narrative. But if Greenwald\u2019s account is about journalism, Poitras\u2019s is a subtle and artful character study and Kucherena\u2019s is an attempt at the Russian novel \u2014 a man alone in a room, wrestling with his conscience \u2014 Stone\u2019s is the explicit blockbuster version, told in high gloss with big, emotional music and digestible plot points that will appeal to mass audiences. As Wizner wisely anticipated, it is the narrative most likely to cement Snowden\u2019s story in Americans\u2019 minds.Snowden declined to comment for this article, but Stone told me he had seen the film and liked it. At a screening at Comic-\u00adCon a few months later, Snowden would beam in via satellite to give his somewhat wary approval. \u201cIt was something that made me really nervous,\u201d he said of Stone\u2019s film. \u201cBut I think he made it work.\u201dAs Stone intended, Snowden shows up at the end of the film. He appears in a wood-\u00adpaneled room in Kucherena\u2019s dacha, a modest, foreign-\u00adlooking space, with little to see except a vase of flowers and some curtains in the background. The Snowden who speaks is not the stoic version, but one who manages to deliver a Stone-\u00adcaliber movie line. \u201cI no longer have to worry about what happens tomorrow,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause I\u2019m happy with what I\u2019ve done today.\u201d Just before the screen fades to black, Snowden is shown gazing toward a window, a faint, inscrutable smile on his face.Gordon-\u00adLevitt was so moved by Snowden\u2019s story that he donated most of his salary from the film to the A.C.L.U. and used the rest to collaborate with Wizner on a series of videos about democracy. Wizner was preparing to petition Obama to grant Snowden a presidential pardon in the fall, and he hoped Stone\u2019s film would help transform the public\u2019s perception of his client. Kucherena, meanwhile, had turned \u201cTime of the Octopus\u201d into a trilogy \u2014 in the sequel, the N.S.A. sends an assassin to Russia to \u201celiminate\u201d Joshua Cold. He hoped to come to the United States for the premiere of the film, in which he has a cameo as a Russian banker who encounters Snowden at a party. \u201cIf I can get a visa, why not?\u201d he said.In July, Stone and Wizner joined forces for an A.C.L.U. event. The evening was billed as a conversation with Wizner about surveillance and Edward Snowden, with Stone hosting at his Tudor-\u00adstyle home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles.As several dozen West Coast supporters of the A.C.L.U. filtered into Stone\u2019s backyard, the director sat camped out on a bench by the pool, taking the party in from a distance. He boasted that he had recently cut four more minutes from the film, bringing the run time to a lean 134 minutes. I asked if he would keep finessing until the end. \u201cNo, it\u2019s over,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is it. Now I die.\u201dWizner roamed around, inspecting a meditation gazebo outfitted with a large gold Buddha. After several people inquired who was playing him in the movie, the lawyer came up with a pithy reply. \u201cKevin Spacey, reprising his role as Keyser Soze,\u201d he joked. \u201cThe guy behind the guy behind the guy \u2014 hiding in plain sight.\u201d (Wizner is not a character in Stone\u2019s film.)That week, NPR ran an interview with a Russian security official who posited that Snowden is maybe, probably, most definitely cooperating with Russian intelligence. This inevitably set Wizner off. \u201cOf course, this is the same week that Snowden is blasting Putin on Twitter every day,\u201d Wizner said to Borman, who nodded along. The producer suggested that Snowden\u2019s critics would claim it\u2019s a cover. \u201cThat\u2019s what they say!\u201d Wizner said. \u201cThis is preapproved criticism so that it\u2019ll seem like he\u2019s free, but actually Putin is the master pulling the strings.\u201dEventually, everyone moved to the den, a spacious, brightly lit room filled with family photos. Matthew Weiner, the \u201cMad Men\u201d creator, took a seat by a stack of DVDs, which included multiple seasons of his own hit TV show. Others arranged themselves along wicker chairs that lined the room\u2019s perimeter. The whole thing had the feeling of a P.T.A. meeting, but without the stale cookies.Wizner got up and spoke for some time about his efforts as Snowden\u2019s lawyer. As he opened the room to questions, someone asked how long Russia could be relied on to keep Snowden safe. Wizner turned the question over to Stone. \u201cOliver is the Russia expert,\u201d he said with a hint of passive-\u00adaggression. Since completing \u201cSnowden,\u201d Stone had become absorbed in his newfound interest in Russia and announced that he was making a documentary about Putin. In recent months, he had accompanied the Russian president to a theater performance and a World War II Victory Day parade in Moscow. \u201cHe represents a different point of view that Americans don\u2019t want to hear,\u201d Stone had told RIA Novosti, a Russian news service.When someone else asked about Stone\u2019s experience of making \u201cSnowden,\u201d his answer was despondent. \u201cIt was really a horrible experience in every way,\u201d he said.

On the opposite wall was a sketch of Genghis Khan, the feared Mongolian emperor. Stone called him a liberal.\u201cYes, Genghis Khan \u2014 misunderstood,\u201d Wizner teased.Stone smiled and cocked his head. \u201cListen, the A.C.L.U. should defend him!\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Even Uber Couldn\u2019t Bridge the China Divide", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtTravis Kalanick, the co-founder and chief executive of the ride-hailing giant Uber, often defended his eagerness to risk billions on winning the Chinese market with a simple question: If you have a chance to become Amazon and Alibaba at the same time, why not try?The implication was simple. Over the last couple of decades, Amazon, Facebook, Google and other American technology giants have each followed a similar script for world domination. Like an imperial armada rolling out from North America\u2019s West Coast, these companies would try to establish beachheads on every other continent.But when American giants tried to enter the waters of China, the world\u2019s largest internet market, the armada invariably ran aground.Plagued by opaque and ever-shifting regulations and a culturally abstruse way of doing business, American companies fell to a series of local giants. Instead of Google, Baidu. Instead of Facebook, WeChat, owned by the giant Tencent. And instead of Amazon, Alibaba.That has left us with a divide: Today, there is the Chinese internet, and there is the internet of the rest of the world. A network seen in its early days as a tool to foster financial and political unity across a fragmented planet has irrevocably cleaved into two completely separate spheres.Entrepreneurs across the globe can choose to win in China or the rest of the world. You can be Alibaba or you can be Amazon. You can be Uber or you can be Didi. But you can\u2019t be both. Given the rising Chinese market and increasing tension over the role of American tech firms in the rest of the globe, the gulf between the two sides promises to become one of the most important factors in determining the shape of global tech innovation.How exactly might the war play out? In some ways, being at the mercy of two poles of internet leadership could be good for citizens of planet Earth. In emerging markets like India, the Middle East and parts of Africa and South America, the giants of China and the United States are increasingly investing billions to compete for local customers in e-commerce, social networking, ride sharing and other markets.\u201cAmazon is increasingly making its own branded products, taking on Procter & Gamble and others, and also getting into the logistics business, and shipping, and everything else,\u201d Mr. Clark said. \u201cBut Alibaba is a marketplace that doesn\u2019t hold inventory and describes themselves as helping local merchants \u2014 so maybe there\u2019s some argument that Alibaba could serve as a counter globally to Amazon.\u201d\u201cIn that way it could be like the Yalta Conference,\u201d said Mr. Clark, referring to the 1945 meeting in which the victors of World War II determined the postwar geopolitical order.\u201cThe barrels that will be thrown at you when you\u2019re trying to do business in China will just never stop,\u201d said Mark Natkin, the managing director of Marbridge Consulting, an advisory firm based in Beijing. \u201cYou\u2019ll constantly be above one barrel or recovering from jumping one, and as you\u2019re dusting yourself off you look down the road and here comes the next one.\u201dCompared with previous failures, Uber seemed to do everything right in China. It set up a separate company, Uber China, which had a buy-in from local investors, including from a local giant, Baidu. It hired many local experts, and worked closely with the national government to foster friendly relations.Insiders say Mr. Kalanick was also personally invested in the deal. He visited China eight times in the last year and a half, and became something of a tech star in the Chinese media.Publicly Mr. Kalanick had insisted he was fighting for total victory in China. But he must have known that Uber would always struggle to achieve dominance, given the emerging centrality of ride-sharing to the future of infrastructure in China. Still, even if he failed to win everything in China, investing early in the country seemed too big to skip.For now, it\u2019s especially delicious frosting. The $2 billion Uber spent tackling China is now worth about $7 billion in the new merged entity; if Didi does become one of China\u2019s largest tech companies, the value of Uber\u2019s stake in China could rise geometrically, making the firm much more attractive in a potential initial public offering. Pulling out of China also frees up Uber to invest more in other markets \u2014 India and Indonesia are big targets \u2014 as well as expand its expertise in core technological initiatives like mapping data and self-driving cars.But if spending big to tackle China ultimately works out for Uber, it will be an anomaly, and certainly not a model for other American tech giants.\u201cThe ride-sharing market is one the few markets where the upside is big enough to justify going in,\u201d Mr. Thompson said. \u201cFor most other companies, going into China is still going to be nothing but pain.\u201dEmail: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Off to College? Maybe These Devices Should Go Along", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixWHEN Vanessa Arreola, 18, starts her freshman year at Stanford University this fall, the top item on her back-to-school wish list is a MacBook Pro.She said she wouldn\u2019t consider a tablet because she prefers a traditional keyboard. She relies on apps like Google Docs for documents and Google Slides for presentations, which are available through a web browser.\u201cA tablet is just like your cellphone, but bigger,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see a point of getting a tablet.\u201dBut Claire Ashcroft, 19, who studies public health at Brigham Young University in Idaho, said the opposite. Half of her textbooks are digitized, and she uses apps like Microsoft Excel and Word \u2014 so her ideal school device would be a Windows machine with a touch screen, like a Microsoft Surface tablet.The polarizing responses illustrate how back-to-school shopping for technology gadgets has become increasingly complex for parents. In the past, the dilemma for most students was whether to get a Windows PC or a Mac. Now, because of a proliferation of different computing forms with the rise of mobile devices, the debate has shifted toward whether to buy a computer or a tablet \u2014 and which operating system on top of that.Then there are the different types of software and tools that students use, like flashcard apps or readers for digital textbooks, some of which are for mobile devices and others for computers.To make back-to-school season easier, parents should have a conversation with their children about what devices and which operating system to buy based on their student\u2019s area of studies and the apps they use.I also compiled a guide to some of the best back-to-school products, including computers, mobile devices, audio accessories and food gadgets. The list was curated after testing dozens of products and interviewing five college students about the tools that help them do homework and get through cramming sessions. (While this list focuses on college students, many of whom will be getting their own computers for the first time, some items would also be a good fit for high schoolers.)The students I polled were split on whether a laptop or tablet would be the best study tool. In general, students in science-oriented fields would probably benefit from a laptop, which can handle multitasking more easily and run more powerful apps than tablets. For designers and liberal arts majors who are using more lightweight apps for writing essays or drawing sketches, a tablet may be a better fit.There are two caveats. First, Apple is expected to release a brand-new iPhone this fall; so if you go the Apple route, it would be wise to wait a few months. Second, these are high-end phones that cost roughly $700, which could easily blow your budget.High-quality audio gear is a sound investment for students. Roommates can be loud distractions from schoolwork and sleep, plus a bit of music can ease the pain of typing out a tedious essay.Speaking of water kettles, a food gadget or two will not go amiss in students\u2019 lives, especially if the devices offer a shortcut to downing some caffeine or gobbling up ramen.But she would like a Microsoft Surface tablet.\u201cIf we\u2019re talking wishful here, I would choose that,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a couple of friends with those, and I think they\u2019re pretty nice.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the maker of the Nexus 6P.

{"Headline": "Florida Company Gets Approval to Put Robotic Lander on Moon", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "Supported byA small start-up has received the green light from the federal government to do something that NASA has not done for more than four decades: land on the moon.Moon Express has a ways to go before it can reach the lunar surface, which it hopes to do next year. It still has to assemble the lander. The rocket that it plans to launch on has yet to fly even once.And one of its competitors could beat it to the moon, and the $20 million.The approval reflects an effort to encourage 21st-century commercial space endeavors while staying within an international space treaty written 49 years ago when outer space was a rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, and the idea of a start-up going to the moon an unlikely fantasy.The Juno spacecraft has reached Jupiter. Here are some other spacecraft exploring our solar system, launched by NASA and the world\u2019s other space agencies.In the bubbly optimism that followed, the X Prize Foundation enlisted Google to finance reaching the loftier target of the moon. The Google Lunar X Prize, announced in 2007, called for putting a spacecraft on the moon that would be able to send back video and images and also move more than 500 meters. The first team to achieve that would claim $20 million; second place would be rewarded with $5 million.For John Noble Wilford, the reporter who covered the moon landing for The New York Times from mission control in Houston, the memory is invigorating.As Moon Express worked on its MX-1 lander, company officials realized that they had other hurdles: paperwork and international treaties.The United States fought to include that clause, rejecting the Soviet view that space exploration should be limited to governments, said Matthew Schaefer, the director of the space, cyber and telecommunications law program at the University of Nebraska.While the American negotiators did not necessarily foresee a company like Moon Express, \u201cthe U.S. government wanted to keep that option open,\u201d Professor Schaefer said.Nonetheless, that would have been a roadblock, said Dr. Richards, Moon Express\u2019s chief executive, because the United States did not have any procedures for authorizing and supervising what companies like Moon Express want to do.\u201cAny application to the U.S. government would have been vetoed by the State Department, due to the lack of regulatory frameworks that would allow the U.S. government to remain in compliance with the Outer Space Treaty,\u201d he said.Moon Express has now employed this payload review process for its lunar trip. The F.A.A. sent its approval on July 20, the 47th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing on the moon.Mr. Jain said that low-cost missions to the moon \u2014 under $10 million \u2014 would transform space exploration. But the company has revealed little about its customers and much of the hoped-for business like the mining of platinum and helium-3 is speculative. (The helium-3 would be for fusion power plants that do not yet exist.)At present, there is little worry that the moonscape is about to be scarred by a commercial onslaught. The MX-1 is about the size of a coffee table, and NASA has left far more litter on the moon, most recently crashing its Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer into the far side of the moon in 2014.Of more concern is the preservation of earlier artifacts like the Apollo landing sites, especially as the Lunar X Prize offers a $4 million bonus for broadcasting video from one of those sites.Moon Express said that it had not yet decided on a landing site, but that it would defer to NASA\u2019s wishes and stay away from the Apollo sites.Mr. Jain said the greatest opportunities were the ones not yet imagined, just as Apple, when it created the iPhone, did not foresee the explosion of apps that would run on the device.\u201cMore importantly,\u201d Mr. Jain said, \u201cwe don\u2019t know what the Pok\u00e9mon Go of the moon is going to be.\u201dAn earlier version of this article gave an outdated location for the headquarters of Moon Express.

{"Headline": "The Innovation Campus: Building Better Ideas", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "Supported byWhere once the campus amenities arms race was waged over luxury dorms and recreation facilities, now colleges and universities are building deluxe structures for the generation of wonderful ideas. They and their partners in industry are pouring millions into new buildings for business, engineering and applied learning that closely resemble the high-tech workplace, itself inspired by the minimally partitioned spaces of the garage and the factory.What architects take from Building 20 is not its ramshackle aesthetic \u2014 though some believe less polish provides more freedom \u2014 but the importance of mixing disciplines, of work performed out in the open, and of transition zones like hallways and staircases as sites for productive run-ins.Though studies have shown that proximity and conversation can produce creative ideas, there\u2019s little research on the designs needed to facilitate the process. Still, there are commonalities.Staircases and halls are wide and often daylit, encouraging people to dwell between their appointments in hopes of having a creative collision. Exposure to natural light itself contributes to improved workplace performance. There\u2019s also much more to do with your hands than take notes in class: The need to move your body, by working on a prototype, taking the stairs or going in search of caffeine at a centralized cafe, is built in, providing breaks to let the mind wander.The rationales for these buildings are varied: Employers are dissatisfied with graduates\u2019 preparation, students are unhappy with outdated teaching methods, and colleges want to attract students whose eyes are on postgrad venture capital and whose scalable ideas might come in handy on campus. And so universities of all sizes, both public (Wichita State, University of Utah, University of Iowa) and private (Cornell, Northwestern, Stanford), have opened or are planning such facilities.The studio is in the Bloomberg Center, named to acknowledge a $100 million gift from Bloomberg Philanthropies, matching New York City\u2019s contribution toward the total cost for phase one, which is estimated at $800 million. A sculptural staircase, jutting provocatively from the side of the building, was designed to encourage students and faculty members to take the stairs to their work space instead of the shorter elevator route between front door and desk. So much of contemporary design for innovation involves adding friction to people\u2019s work lives, as unexpected encounters (with people, with different spaces, with art) are supposed to lead to unexpected ideas.\u201cBeing in bigger interactive spaces encourages expansive thinking, while being in a box of a room encourages box thinking,\u201d said Dan Huttenlocher, founding dean and vice provost at Cornell Tech. \u201cSometimes you need to be in a box to concentrate, but to always sit in a little box is a problem.\u201dNo one has a private office at the Bloomberg Center, the primary academic building, and opaque walls are few. The only spaces faculty members can truly call their own are lockable storage cabinets, with carts for equipment. Traditional classrooms, too, are few \u2014 the Cornell Tech curriculum privileges projects over lectures. Instead, there will be options so that people can choose how they like to work, from open-plan spaces by the windows, to a roof deck with a garden, to huddle rooms for groups of five or less.\u201cAs you begin to understand how people work together, there is an ideal size of collaboration,\u201d said Ung-Joo Scott Lee, principal at Morphosis, the architects. \u201cBeyond five people it is too much of a crowd.\u201dIf this sounds like Silicon Valley, it should. \u201cWe looked at Pixar in Emeryville very carefully, along with Bloomberg L.P. and Google, who have sizable office space in New York and understand the constraints of the urban environment,\u201d Mr. Huttenlocher said. (Until it moves onto its own campus, Cornell Tech is headquartered in the Google building in Chelsea \u2014 every designer working for a university, it seems, has taken a swing through Mountain View.)\u201cPixar had to bring together very different cultures and get them to work as one, the creative and the business side, but also creative and tech people,\u201d Mr. Huttenlocher said.to this live-work building, anticipating the early lifestyle of dot-com employees, whose living quarters usually resemble walk-in closets. The Utah version is more plush, however: Residents, who can be graduate or undergraduate and in any major, can choose pods (cubbylike rooms with built-in bed, desk, storage and TV), lofts in an industrial vernacular (beds in a communal setting with shared kitchen, lounge and bathrooms) or more traditional single or double rooms.Different floors have different themes, based on Utah\u2019s existing strengths: one for games and digital media, one for adventure and gear, one for design and the arts, one for global impact and sustainability. The ground-floor \u201cgarage\u201d has workshops equipped with 3-D printers, laser cutters and other prototyping tools, available to anyone at the university and staffed by work-study students. All the programs offered by the Lassonde Entrepreneurship Institute, the division that is building the studios, are extracurricular and interdisciplinary; a few degrees are offered in partnership with the business school.\u201cOne thing about the building is it has no formal classrooms, and no faculty or staff offices,\u201d said Troy D\u2019Ambrosio, executive director of the institute. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to have a classroom because that says, \u2018In this room you learn, out here you don\u2019t learn.\u2019\u201dInnovation buildings tend to be affiliated with schools of business or engineering, but there is a strong arts presence within them. Lassonde Studios, designed by Yazdani Studio of Cannon Design, hopes to attract students from industrial design, the fine arts and communications. \u201cWe have made an effort to say, \u2018Entrepreneurs create new things, and you do that too,\u2019\u201d Mr. D\u2019Ambrosio said.A thousand students applied for the 400 beds this fall, and 37 percent of the chosen are women. \u201cIt\u2019s important to have a critical mass of women involved so women will come in,\u201d he said. \u201cEngineering is very heavily male, the business school is more male than female, but we are getting applicants from the fine arts, humanities and health sciences. Students have 35 to 40 different majors, and that happened pretty organically.\u201dThe studios are named after a Canadian businessman, Pierre Lassonde, who gave the initial $7 million for the building (he and his late wife, Claudette MacKay-Lassonde, are Utah alumni). The bulk of the $45 million construction costs were funded by a revenue bond, to be paid back with \u201crents\u201d from students. The experience will cost. A double goes for $6,830 for the academic year, a three-person loft for $9,135. Elsewhere on campus: $4,874 for a double, $4,367 for a triple deluxe.The radical restructuring of both curriculum and architecture are supposed to contribute to greater parity. Gone is a first year of large lecture courses on basic science. Instead, students work alone or in small groups on a \u201cpassion project.\u201d \u201cIf you are working on an efficient filtering system for water in Ethiopia, you will need to know more about mathematics, about partial differential equations,\u201d Dr. Kozinski said. \u201cThey would come to us, and then we would gently start introducing mathematics. Learning by doing and learning in social spaces with professors is reflected in the design.\u201dInformal lounges are threaded throughout the building, from a generous one at entry level to small banquettes in the wide hallways. Active learning classrooms (there are no lecture halls) combine different sizes and heights of tables and chairs, and are equipped with projectors and I.T.-integrated furniture from Steelcase. The \u201cSandbox\u201d space, which includes collaboration-size rooms and a 3-D prototyping lab, gives students the option to brainstorm on their own or work with classmates. The architects specified some furniture with built-in scribble pads, and many of the walls are writable back-painted glass.\u201cWe equate it to a design lab like in architecture school, a place where you can go brainstorm, sketch on the scribble pads, work with classmates,\u201d Paul Stevens, a senior principal at ZAS, said. \u201cOr you can take your sketches and use hand tools to start making a sample.\u201d Tool cribs hold smaller materials for experiential learning. Larger, purpose-built labs are equipped with professional-grade equipment for testing and prototyping, including a concrete-lined mechanical lab with a 12-ton crane. \u201cThis is where you get to build things like solar cars, or crush concrete,\u201d he said.Once students have their model, they can pitch it to industry leaders in a dressed-up lounge intended as a bridge space between students and the wider world. It was important, Mr. Stevens said, that it resemble a corporate lounge \u2014 \u201ca beautiful, high-end-finish space\u201d \u2014 rather than an intimidating board room, and the school made it a priority to have best-in-class furniture, including Eames chairs, to set the tone.The Garage provides cafe, meeting, classroom and workshop space for anyone on campus \u2014 a student center with an entrepreneurial purpose, with amenities like 3-D printers, Bluescape interactive screens and design software. Programs focus on helping students develop ideas and finding them mentors. Melissa Crounse, the executive director of the Garage and a former Google employee, holds weekly dinners for alumni and students, asking the successful (one assumes) alumni to tell a story about a previous failure.Gensler began the design process by diagraming the paths of potential users, from visiting entrepreneurs giving a lecture to a student prototyping a project through sewing, 3-D printing or laser cutting. By overlaying those paths they saw \u201chot spots\u201d where students, faculty members and guests might naturally congregate, like areas around whiteboards on conference room doors.\u201cIf you keep the schedule on the outside of the conference room, the act of signing up in an analog way causes a lot of discussions,\u201d Mr. Heiser said. \u201cMaybe meetings tie together. You need to create experiences that heighten the potential interaction.\u201dArt schools have always had open plans, daylit work spaces and power tools. But the new arts building also has many elements of the STEM-focused innovation campus in hopes of facilitating the mixing of disciplines and modes of instruction.Iowa\u2019s building attempts to embody that idea by placing itself along a primary pedestrian route, so seeing new work is unavoidable. The curriculum, too, draws in majors from across the university, with popular classes that include building your own bicycle.\u201cEngineering majors are often impressed by art students\u2019 relative high level of tool knowledge,\u201d Mr. McGuire said. \u201cThey see their experiences in various studios, from the suite of CNC equipment to traditional fabrication, complementing and enhancing theoretical knowledge they\u2019ve learned in engineering courses.\u201dSet near the university\u2019s museums, the building, like Iowa\u2019s, is positioned as a campus crossroad. People from other disciplines may literally be stopped in their tracks by what\u2019s going on in the transparent ground-floor galleries and workshops, or be drawn inside by a glimpse of people studying in the treehouselike reading room.Here, classes that combine art and science and art and technology include \u201cDrawing With Code\u201d and, most appropriately, \u201cData as Material,\u201d which delves into the history of using information to create art.\u201cWe reached out to the local business community and asked what they wanted in a graduate, and they told us there was a two-year gap between a graduate and someone who is a productive worker,\u201d said Emily Patterson, associate director of facilities planning at Wichita State. \u201cThey were asking for a more prepared student.\u201dSo in the $25 million Experiential Engineering Building, set to open for classes in January, students will be able to do hands-on and applied learning in 25 specialized science and engineering labs; engineering hub rooms will be open 24/7. A separate makerspace with evening hours, run by GoCreate, will offer facilities for metalworking, woodworking, textiles and digital creation to students and local residents. Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, a software company, is planning a 3-D immersive lab, and a few other spaces have been set aside for local businesses.Today\u2019s innovation campuses tend to make their pipeline to the real world explicit. Airbus Americas is moving its engineering center, and 400 Wichita employees, to a new structure on the campus, to be built on ground leased from the university. The center will also have room for up to 100 student workers. In another partnership, a law enforcement training center, with construction costs paid by the city and county, will serve the police departments as well as Wichita State\u2019s criminal justice students.Kansas public education has experienced state cutbacks at every level in recent months. Wichita State, along with other Kansas universities, has increased tuition 5 percent to make up for the budget cuts. \u201cState funding is dwindling, so we have to be innovative in our financing,\u201d Ms. Patterson said. Construction has gone forward on the Innovation Campus because the Experiential Engineering Building, designed by Perkins + Will and WDM Architects, is financed via grants to Kansas universities to produce more engineering graduates in a state where aviation and energy are top industries.How successful will Wichita State and other universities be at fueling innovation and, ultimately, a new entrepreneurship economy? The proof may be many years out, and difficult to quantify. But the pressure on administrators to change their campuses may soon come, not just from above and within, but from below.An anecdote from Kevin B. Sullivan of Payette, whose firm has interdisciplinary science and engineering centers under construction at Northeastern and Tufts, underscores the urgency. \u201cI\u2019m on the board of my daughter\u2019s high school, and what they are doing there is taking the existing library, gutting it and turning it into a tech-enablement space,\u201d he said. \u201cThe college process may be dumbed down from what they do in high school.\u201dAlexandra Lange is the architecture critic for Curbed and the author of \u201cWriting About Architecture: Mastering the Language of Buildings and Cities.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sydney Morning Herald Faces Uncertain Print Future in Australia", "Date": "2016-08-17", "News": "Supported byThey pushed for women to get the vote in Australia\u2019s national elections. They brought down a central bank board member. And they helped convict a state official.The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and their sister publications at Fairfax Media have been among the most powerful voices in Australia for more than 150 years, shaping public opinion on politics, exposing shady business practices and targeting vast criminal operations. Once mocked as a \u201cGranny\u201d for its cautious, worldly perspective, The Herald long ago embraced the reputation and the nickname.But Fairfax\u2019s newspapers now face a diminished future, with company executives even discussing whether to stop printing The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age on weekdays. If they do, it would signal a new low in the decline of the global newspaper business, the radical retreat of centuries-old, mainstream metropolitan newspapers with national influence.The prospect has dismayed many Australians who wonder what it means for civic life and what it says about the country\u2019s place in the world. Australians consider themselves a highly informed and highly educated society, despite their geographic isolation. And The Herald and Age, with a history of sending correspondents to far-flung locales like the battlefields of Europe and Southeast Asia, have been central to the discourse.The weakening of independent voices like The Herald also leaves the Australian market increasingly dominated by the partisan agenda of News Corporation, which owns the country\u2019s top three newspapers by weekday circulation. The struggles at Fairfax represent an especially satisfying victory for News Corporation, run by the homegrown billionaire Rupert Murdoch, who turned his family\u2019s original asset \u2014 a single provincial Australian newspaper \u2014 into a global media empire. Although News Corporation has faced its own financial strains, its other successful businesses, like a real estate website, have provided better support for its journalistic operations.Trouble at Fairfax Media \u201cconstitutes a crisis in civic journalism in our country, because the resources will no longer be there,\u201d said Eric Beecher, a former top editor at The Herald and at News Corporation who is now the publisher of Crikey, a news website. \u201cThe Age and The Sydney Morning Herald have always done the heavy lifting of civic journalism and investigative journalism.\u201dEven by the newspaper industry\u2019s standards, readers of Australia\u2019s print newspapers have been declining at an unusually rapid rate.The chief executive for Fairfax Media, Greg Hywood, said the company had not made a decision whether to halt weekday printing, although it was under review. If printing is halted, he said, the company\u2019s journalistic approach would not be affected.\u201cOur readers have never been hungrier for good-quality news reporting,\u201d Mr. Hywood said.When The Herald opened its state-of-the-art, $260 million presses in 1995, the newspaper\u2019s Saturday edition was a hefty 400 pages. The company predicted it would easily grow to 600 pages.After all, The Herald and the rest of the Fairfax Media papers had practically cornered the market in Sydney and Melbourne for classified advertising for cars, jobs and real estate. Those so-called rivers of gold helped support a robust reporting operation.\u201cWe wondered how on earth we would print a paper that size,\u201d said Mr. Hywood, who was once the Washington correspondent for another Fairfax newspaper, The Australian Financial Review.It was also the same year that Fairfax started its first digital news site, in retrospect, roughly the peak for the print business.The Saturday edition has now shrunk to around 200 pages. Fairfax has cut more than 500 jobs at city newspapers over the last five years, including 100 in April, according to Australia\u2019s union for journalists. And last year The Herald\u2019s cherished printing presses were sold for $34 million.The headwinds now buffeting The Herald and Age are global, as the internet erodes the protections once afforded by geography. There\u2019s the ubiquitous competition from Facebook and Google. Digital native publications like BuzzFeed and The Huffington Post each have small Australian newsrooms without the sizable costs of legacy papers like The Herald.The \u201crivers of gold\u201d have evaporated. Advertising and subscriptions have particularly wilted on weekdays; weekends now represent two-thirds of the revenues at Fairfax\u2019s major newspapers.In the sign of the depths of the print problems, the company this month wrote off much of its investment in the newspapers. Fairfax\u2019s main saving grace has been its fast-growing real estate website, Domain, which has helped offset the losses.Such industry challenges forced papers in some large American cities to rethink their print presence years ago. The Times-Picayune of New Orleans cut printing to three days a week, while The Seattle Post-Intelligencer is online only. Facing cutthroat competition in the crowded British market, The Independent in London, which started in the 1980s to shake up the media establishment, went digital this year.Some of The Herald\u2019s wounds were self-inflicted.As the dot-com boom took off and media companies moved online, Fairfax separated its digital operations, in the hope of eventually taking the group public. At The Herald, there were two newsrooms, one for the newspaper and one for the web.The division created a rift. A younger online staff chased clicks, loading the site up with gossip-fueled content, heavy on sex, celebrity and crime. It rankled more seasoned veterans in the print newsroom, who lamented the shift away from weightier topics like the domestic economy and global politics.\u201cIt was viewed that online there was a lot more Paris Hilton than Paris, France, and that to win online you needed to be a tabloid newspaper,\u201d said Mark Scott, a former Fairfax executive who most recently served as chief executive of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. \u201cThe Herald\u2019s strength had always been its great quality, broadsheet traditions.\u201dThe newsrooms were eventually merged and the website now takes a somewhat more balanced approach. But stories about Kylie Jenner\u2019s Vogue cover and the abs of Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, are still intermingled online with more hard-hitting newspaper articles about the terror links in a child care fraud and the serious flaws in the country\u2019s census.Like many media operations, Fairfax is trying to strike a difficult balance. The meatier topics may play well to the newspaper audience, generally an older crowd. But Mr. Hywood, the Fairfax chief, said that online readers, who skew younger, want a broader mix.In terms of readers, the digital strategy appears to be clicking. The Herald is the nation\u2019s leading website, by the number of paying subscribers.\u201cThat can be criticized by people who prefer highbrow content,\u201d said Megan Brownlow, an executive director in the Sydney offices of PricewaterhouseCoopers, the consulting firm. \u201cBut when you\u2019re in a numbers game like internet advertising, highbrow content is hard to monetize.\u201dEven so, it strikes a nerve within the newsroom, which worries about losing its voice within Australian society.The ranks of The Herald, like so many newspapers around the world, have been decimated by cuts over the years. Reporters have gone on strike, deriding the rounds of job losses.Some losses have cut to the core. Four years ago, 70 journalists were laid off within one week. Gone were the urban affairs editor, a senior political correspondent, a specialist feature writer, a senior business reporter, the health editor, arts editor and senior crime reporter.Mr. Hywood denies that reporters are now thin on the ground. Fairfax plans to use the profits from non-news properties, like Domain and a television streaming service, Stan, to promote and support the company\u2019s journalism.But the financial picture at the newspapers continues to deteriorate, forcing Fairfax to contemplate the once-unthinkable. If The Herald drastically cuts its publication schedule, the fear inside and outside the newsroom is that the journalistic endeavors will suffer.Kate McClymont, 58, has been breaking news at The Sydney Morning Herald for decades. One of the newspaper\u2019s marquee journalists, Ms. McClymont appears in the paper\u2019s ads.\u201cWe have been holding the powerful in this city to account for a long time,\u201d Ms. McClymont said.Most recently, she pursued a state government minister, Eddie Obeid, uncovering how his private businesses were improperly benefiting from his public role. Mr. Obeid was found guilty in June of misusing his public office. He will soon face a second court case over mining leases he obtained from the state government.\u201cWe have shone a light where crooks would prefer places remained dark,\u201d Ms. McClymont said. \u201cI hate the idea of people getting away with anything.\u201d\u201cIt is bad for democracy,\u201d she added, \u201cif this voice is diminished in any way.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "From False Alarm to Panic: Inside Kennedy Airport\u2019s Chaotic Night", "Date": "2016-08-15", "News": "Supported byJennifer Rosen was scheduled to depart Kennedy International Airport on an 8:55 p.m. flight to San Francisco but instead found herself stuck at Gate C62 in Terminal 2. It was the typical misery of summer airline travel \u2014 or so it seemed.A short distance way away, in another terminal, something more unpredictable than the weather had begun to sweep across the New York airport:Panic.It spread quickly and without warning.By the time Sunday night was over, Ms. Rosen, 32, had sprawled out under a table seeking cover, followed a crowd of people who bolted through a secure door onto the tarmac, frantically called her sister to find out what was happening and tell her that she was alive, and, finally, made a mad dash from the terminal to join mobs of travelers who thought they might be living through an episode of terror.In the end, it proved to be a false alarm.While the authorities were still trying to piece together exactly how a report of gunfire at 9:34 p.m. outside the security checkpoint at Terminal 8 led to complete turmoil across one of the nation\u2019s busiest airports, the accounts of passengers in interviews and on social media offered a lesson in the anatomy of fear.It was a night of confusion and dread, informed by the latest headlines \u2014 including reports of recent attacks on airports in Brussels and Istanbul \u2014 as much as fact. In the absence of official information or instructions, unconfirmed reports from social media fueled the hysteria.Officials said there was no evidence that what took place at Kennedy Airport was the result of a hoax. It was, rather, a sign of the times.\u201cRight now, what is being concentrated on is the investigation into what the catalyst of the incident is,\u201d said Joe Pentangelo, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the airport.Joe Haviland was at Terminal 8 seeing off his family when the first wave of panic hit.People nearby had been gathered watching the Olympics, as Usain Bolt of Jamaica made his bid for a third gold medal in the 100-meter dash.\u201cWe heard a big celebration,\u201d Mr. Haviland told Fox News shortly after being evacuated.He described hearing something like a loud pop, followed by the sight of a herd of people running his direction.\u201cWhen you see 80 people come running around the corner,\u201d he said, \u201cand they break a door to get out, you think \u2018Oh my God, what is happening?\u2019\u201dHe said he saw \u201cpeople working for the airline taking off their shirts,\u201d and saying, \u201cThis is not worth it, I am leaving.\u201dWithin minutes, he said, police officers with their guns drawn were shouting, \u201cShow me your hands!\u201dThe bomb squad soon arrived, and the area was evacuated.But inside Terminal 8, by the departure gates, many passengers had no idea anything was wrong.Judy Rothman Rof\u00e9, who had been visiting her son in Brooklyn and was waiting for an American Airlines flight back to Los Angeles, was waiting by Gate 33.Around 10 p.m., a passenger nearby was checking the internet and told her it seemed their flight was not delayed because of the weather.\u201cThere is a shooter at large,\u201d she was told.Still, she said, as the news filtered out, people around her were relatively calm. \u201cIt was business as usual in our section of the terminal,\u201d she said.Until it wasn\u2019t.Shortly after 11, she said, \u201cwe heard screaming.\u201d It was unclear what set off the wave of panic, but suddenly the eerie calm turned to chaos.\u201cLots of screaming, crying, mass hysteria,\u201d she said. The gate agents, she said, were nowhere to be found; passengers threw themselves under counters and huddled under chairs.After several minutes, an announcement came over the public address system, ordering passengers to leave their bags, put their hands above their heads and evacuate.As she left, she said, scores of law enforcement officers, weapons drawn, were heading into the terminal.Around the same time, Terminal 1 was also officially evacuated, sending hundreds of people into the street outside the airport, unsure what was happening.The Port Authority said that those were the only two terminals evacuated, but that the panic spread quickly to the rest of the airport.In Terminal 2, where Ms. Rosen was waiting for her San Francisco-bound Delta Air Lines flight, everything seemed normal nearly an hour after the first calls to 911 about a possible gunman. It was around 10:30 p.m. when someone screamed, \u201cShots!\u201d\u201cEveryone started screaming and yelling,\u201d Ms. Rosen said. \u201cI dove under this desk space like everyone else.\u201cThen this guy came running over,\u201d she added. He was not an airport employee or an official, but he had an urgent warning. She recalled that he shouted: \u201cThey\u2019re coming! Let\u2019s go this way!\u201dNot knowing who \u201cthey\u201d might be and not wanting to find out, Ms. Rosen and about a dozen others followed the man through a secure door and onto the tarmac, leaving their belongings behind.\u201cThere were no announcements, nothing,\u201d she said. All she could hear was an ear-piercing alarm.She waited with about 20 others on the hot, humid tarmac. \u201cI called my sister, freaking out,\u201d she said. \u201cI told her I am on the tarmac, people are saying there are gunshots. I think I am safe. If you see news about this, I am O.K.\u201dThe crowd was searching Google and social media when a man \u2014 she thought he was a pilot \u2014 finally said they should return. \u201cPeople were like, \u2018I don\u2019t want to go back inside,\u2019\u201d she said.Still, when the man opened the door, they found things just as chaotic as when they left. A flood of people were running in a single direction, she said. Out of the terminal.Once again she followed the crowd. There were \u201cjust mobs of people,\u201d she said.She spotted a man in a Transportation Security Administration shirt and asked him what was happening. \u201cYou probably have a better idea than I do\u201d was his response, she said.Finally, a little after midnight early on Monday, employees were allowed back inside the airport. Passengers were permitted to collect their belongings.It would take time for operations to fully resume. And thousands of passengers still needed to figure out what to do next. There were no trains running. The Van Wyck Expressway leading to the airport was closed. Cabs were just starting to trickle back.Eventually, Ms. Rosen climbed in a cab with several others and made her way to her twin sister\u2019s apartment in the city.As she prepared to set off for the airport again on Monday morning, she was a bit more leery about the procedures that might be in place in the event of an actual emergency.\u201cI understand situations like this are inherently chaotic, but the lack of communication and guidance just compounded an already tumultuous and traumatic experience,\u201d she said. \u201cAt least in our terminal, they should have had enough time to get a coordinated plan together. But they didn\u2019t, and that caused a lot of unnecessary panic and heartache.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Emoji Gun Control", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorOne change in particular, though, is not delighting everyone. Apple\u2019s new suite of operating systems appears to replace its pistol emoji, which was an image of a six-shooter, with a squirt gun.Apple\u2019s change is ill considered because it breaks the conceptual compatibility that Unicode is meant to establish. Anyone with an iPhone ought to be able to send a message to someone with another company\u2019s products \u2014 like Google or Microsoft or Samsung \u2014 and have what\u2019s delivered communicate the same idea as what\u2019s sent. But with this change, a squirt gun sent from an iPhone will turn into a handgun when received by an Android device, and vice versa.Those behind the campaign to remove the gun from the phone do not appear to be relying on arguments about kids\u2019, or everyone else\u2019s, malleability. Rather, they have portrayed it as a traditional grass-roots messaging campaign: \u201cBy removing the gun emoji,\u201d they write, \u201cwe\u2019ll show America wants stricter access to real guns.\u201d Apple is surely free to favor gun control as a matter of corporate policy \u2014 but it should not be tinkering with our right to express either that or a contrary view on worldwide platforms.It need not be this way. Rather, our devices already enable tech-savvy individuals to invent new emoji-like graphics to send their friends \u2014 and that their friends in turn can pass on to others. Those that attain extensive use could then be standardized in a routine way through Unicode and made available to everyone.Apple, Microsoft, Google and other \u201cbig tech\u201d companies should not be placed in a position, which they themselves do not want, of having to decide which words or emojis do and don\u2019t represent their brand. Apple should be no more responsible if someone uses a gun image in the abstract than if someone happens to type the word \u201cgun.\u201dAs free citizens, we acquiesce to infantilizing digital infrastructure at our peril.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China, Not Silicon Valley, Is Cutting Edge in Mobile Tech", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "Supported byAll of these developments have something in common: The technology was first popularized in China.Silicon Valley has long been the world\u2019s tech capital: It birthed social networking and iPhones and spread those tech products across the globe. The rap on China has been that it always followed in the Valley\u2019s footsteps as government censorship abetted the rise of local versions of Google, YouTube and Twitter.But China\u2019s tech industry \u2014 particularly its mobile businesses \u2014 has in some ways pulled ahead of the United States. Some Western tech companies, even the behemoths, are turning to Chinese firms for ideas.\u201cWe just see China as further ahead,\u201d said Ted Livingston, the founder of Kik, which is headquartered in Waterloo, Ontario.The shift suggests that China could have a greater say in the global tech industry\u2019s direction. Already in China, more people use their mobile devices to pay their bills, order services, watch videos and find dates than anywhere else in the world. Mobile payments in the country last year surpassed those in the United States. By some estimates, loans from a new breed of informal online banks called peer-to-peer lenders did too.The future of online payments and engagements can be found at Liu Zheng\u2019s noodle shop in central Beijing. Liu Xiu\u2019e, 60, and her neighbor, Zhang Lixin, 55, read about the noodle shop on WeChat. Then they ordered and paid for their lunches and took and posted selfies of themselves outside the restaurant, all using the same app.Liu Zheng, who is not related to Liu Xiu\u2019e, said the automated ordering and payments meant he could cut down on wages for waiters. \u201cIn the future, we will only need one waiter to help in the restaurant and one to help with seating,\u201d Mr. Liu said.Before Venmo became the app for millennials to transfer money in the United States, both young and old in China were investing, reimbursing each other, paying bills,and buying products from stores with smartphone-based digital wallets.\u201cQuite frankly, the trope that China copies the U.S. hasn\u2019t been true for years, and in mobile it\u2019s the opposite: The U.S. often copies China,\u201d said Ben Thompson, the founder of the tech research firm Stratechery. \u201cFor the Facebook Messenger app, for example, the best way to understand their road map is to look at WeChat.\u201dA Facebook spokesman declined to comment. Tencent did not respond to requests for comment.Executives from companies like Facebook and smaller rivals like Kik are trying to replicate what has emerged in China: dominant online platforms where users will spend much of their time. Much of that effort is focused on chat.\u201cThe cool thing about chat is it becomes an operating system for your daily life,\u201d Mr. Livingston said. \u201cGoing up to a vending machine, ordering food, getting a cab: Chat can power those interactions, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing with WeChat.\u201dThe biggest advantage for China\u2019s tech industry, according to many analysts, is that it was able to fill a vacuum after the country essentially created much of its economy from scratch following the end of the Cultural Revolution, in 1976. Unlike in the United States, where banks and retailers already have strong holds on customers, China\u2019s state-run lenders are inefficient, and retailers never expanded broadly enough to serve a fast-growing middle class.Many Chinese also never bought a personal computer, meaning smartphones are the primary \u2014 and often first \u2014 computing device for the more than 600 million who have them in China.\u201cThe U.S. was first to credit cards, and everyone there has a personal computer. But China, where everyone is on their phones all the time, is now ahead in mobile commerce and mobile payments by virtue of leapfrogging the PC and credit cards,\u201d Mr. Thompson said.Chinese companies also approach the internet in a different way. In the United States, tech firms emphasize simplicity in their apps. But in China, its three major internet companies \u2014 Alibaba, Baidu and the WeChat parent Tencent \u2014 compete to create a single app with as many functions as they can stuff into it.On Alibaba\u2019s Taobao shopping app, people can also buy groceries, buy credits for online games, scan coupons and find deals at stores nearby. Baidu\u2019s mapping app lets users order an Uber, reserve a restaurant or hotel, order in food, buy movie tickets and find just about any type of store nearby.Tencent has opened up WeChat to other companies, allowing them to create apps within WeChat. Ebaoyang \u2014 a start-up that enables people to order oil changes for their cars directly on smartphones \u2014 was at first almost totally reliant on WeChat to attract business. Gao Feng, one of Ebaoyang\u2019s founders, said the company still relied on the app for 50 percent of its payments and 20 percent of new customers.\u201cWe started from WeChat. So it was our main, original source for getting customers,\u201d he said.Between fees for its services and money it makes through online games, WeChat manages to generate $7 in revenue per user each year, according to Nomura. The app has roughly 700 million users, more than the total number of smartphone users in China, in part because some users are outside the country and in part because people have multiple accounts.Much of that comes not from ads, as it might in the United States, but from spending on games, services and goods sold on the app. Those models may not translate from one market to the other, but the two can still borrow from each other, said Carmen Chang, a partner at the venture capital firm New Enterprise Associates.\u201cChina was able to develop a lot of innovative business models, which arose in a different kind of economy,\u201d said Ms. Chang, who spends time in both China and in Menlo Park, Calif. \u201cWhether or not we admit it here in Silicon Valley, it\u2019s had an impact on us and our thinking.\u201dCao Li in Beijing contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Daily Report: More Clean Energy, Brought to You by the Cloud", "Date": "2016-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsThe cloud, as it turns out, may have a very green lining.A prime reason for this is the growing demand from its cloud computing centers, where Apple keeps its customers\u2019 music, photos and much more.On this front, Apple joins a number of other cloud providers, who collectively may change the face of energy production by increasing demand for renewable energy.Big cloud-computing companies are building facilities on an unparalleled scale, and at a time when few others are increasing demand. Dominion Virginia Power, which supplies perhaps the world\u2019s greatest concentration of data centers, reported that overall demand rose 1 percent last year, but demand from data centers rose 9 percent.Amazon Web Services has since committed to obtaining 100 percent of its power from renewable sources. Last year the company purchased a 250,000-panel, 80-megawatt plant in Virginia, which it later sold to Dominion.Other data centers have long been situated near big dams, which provide cheap as well as green power. Lots of building is happening in Iowa, Texas and elsewhere in America\u2019s great wind corridor, to encourage the construction of more wind-driven facilities.Remote locations have other benefits. \u201cWhen your nearest neighbor is 100 acres away, you don\u2019t get as many complaints about the power lines,\u201d said Joe Kava, who heads Google\u2019s data center operations.There are signs it is affecting the way utilities plan future construction. American Electric Power, which operates in 11 states, has said it will add 6,300 megawatts of new wind power and 3,100 megawatts of new solar generation before 2033. An AEP official told me that much of this was attributable to demand from data centers.For many of these companies, it\u2019s not just about saving the planet; power has moved from an incidental cost to a main determinant of profitability. Like nothing else, that has affected the operation of data centers in ways that may improve other big companies\u2019 power consumption.The traditional measure of data center efficiency is power usage effectiveness, or P.U.E. This measures how much power goes into a data center and how much of that is used by computing equipment. For a poorly run center, this number can be 2.0 or higher, meaning it takes two watts of power to put one watt into a computer.Together, these companies are building with their clouds a new kind of industrial infrastructure. It would be something if it also reshaped our power usage for the better.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Celebrity Z-List? Yes, It Exists", "Date": "2016-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic's NotebookMeet the striving celebrity underclass that has risen to dominate the gossip machine. Aspiring models, third-tier reality show stars, impossible-to-place actors, YouTube vloggers and viral news subjects can now all curry coverage just by replenishing their social media accounts with photos of their babies, their butts or both. These are people you\u2019ve probably never heard of \u2014 or have a nagging suspicion you might have, but don\u2019t quite know why.It used to be that the only way a non-recognizable person could land in the pages of the glossy celebrity magazines was to lose 100 pounds, serve as some heartwarming testimony to good-old-fashioned American values, or be murdered. But in the early aughts, the magazines started diversifying their coverage of Hollywood\u2019s leading Jens and Bens with stories on the romantic dupes and plastic surgery nightmares of reality television. Now, as the rise of social media demolishes the leverage that celebrity tabloids once had over their most famous subjects, the gossip industry keeps defining celebrity downward. (After all, no magazine can match the reach of Taylor Swift\u2019s more than 90 million Instagram fans or Kim Kardashian West\u2019s 47 million Twitter followers.)On a recent episode, they take on Brittany Farrar, the ex-girlfriend of Aaron Rodgers\u2019s little brother, Jordan Rodgers (who is now dating the \u201cBachelorette\u201d star JoJo Fletcher), who recently accused Jordan of cheating in a series of Instagram posts. \u201cWhy are we still hearing about her?\u201d Ms. Weber asked. Mr. Finger replied: \u201cBecause she wants us \u2014 she did her due diligence in making sure we talked about her.\u201d And just like that: A Who was born.Time Inc. has started a kind of general-interest publication on the internet-famous just as the internet has atomized celebrity into a zillion tiny fandoms. Few people are typically energized by the generic category of \u201csocial media figure.\u201d They get their kicks by closely following a select few of their favorite stars, the stars\u2019 friends and family, and a network of (often infighting) fans. The obsessive monitoring of all these channels drums up sufficient drama to create an enduring story line, even if only a few thousand people can manage to follow along. Plus, the setup provides fans the illusion of power in determining which Whos become Thems (Blac Chyna, a rap video vixen engaged to Rob Kardashian, is on her way toward top-level recognition) and which seem destined to fade into permanent obscurity (I\u2019m sorry, Sarah Wright Olsen).But these modern fandoms produce grist for non-fans, too. There\u2019s something deliciously surreal about monitoring the online movements of the barely famous, a class of people who are just unpolished, desperate and savvy enough to act mad, sloppy and sexy. The fact that publications like People and Us Weekly are covering it with a straight face adds another absurd layer.Besides, these people are assaulting our social feeds every day whether we like it or not. Outlets like The Shade Room and \u201cWho? Weekly\u201d have managed to extract bits of hilarity, delight and shame out of that arid media landscape. They have intuited what the traditional tabloids don\u2019t quite get: The pursuit of celebrity has emerged as a grand tabloid narrative in and of itself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Back-to-School Divide: $195 Headbands and $1 Glue Sticks", "Date": "2016-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe fashion brand Kate Spade is most known for luxury handbags. But it is also banking on gold-accented staplers, monogrammed planners and $30 ballpoint pens to help buoy sales during the increasingly important back-to-school shopping season.The discount retailer Dollar Tree is also expecting students and their parents to lift sales, particularly after an unusually weak second quarter. But instead of fancy notebooks, it is focusing on the other end of the price spectrum, like $1 packs of tape, glue sticks and pencils.As the income gap in the United States has turned into a chasm, luxury and discount retailers have become increasingly deft at attracting people at the separate ends of the income spectrum. Stores positioned for the middle, like traditional department stores, have struggled by comparison.These days, that divide extends more than ever to what students wear and carry with them to their school lockers.\u201cBoth luxury retailers and value stores, like dollar stores, are benefiting right now from the back-to-school trend,\u201d said Jharonne Martis, a retail analyst with Thomson Reuters. \u201cThey\u2019re really benefiting from their core consumer.\u201dParents expect to spend an average of $673.57 on electronics, clothes and notebooks this year, compared with $630.36 last year, according to the National Retail Federation, an industry trade group. In total, parents of kindergarten through 12th-grade students say they will spend $27.3 billion on school supplies this year, up from $18.4 billion in 2007.The back-to-school season is the second-biggest shopping period of the year, behind Christmas. But while families will spend more than before, how they will do it \u2014 and where they will do it \u2014 varies widely.A growing list of designer notebooks, luxury desk accessories and even beanbag chairs now caters to wealthy back-to-school shoppers. Shoppers can buy a $195 Gucci headband, a $572 Versace backpack and a $28 Terez pencil case on the back-to-school section of Saks\u2019 website. Restoration Hardware has a new \u201cteen\u201d line that includes a $2,000 \u201criveted aluminum\u201d desk and $250 faux fur beanbag chairs.Ms. Martis said she expected Kate Spade\u2019s desk accessories and stationery products to be a big focus this season, projecting that sales would rise 7 percent this quarter at stores open at least a year. (The company said it could not make executives available for an interview.)But back-to-school items are also expected to buoy sales at discount retailers like T. J. Maxx, whose appeal is increasingly wide and which aim at the growing number of poor students and families in the United States.In 2007, about nine million public school students came from low-income households, according to the Department of Education\u2019s National Center for Education Statistics. In 2014, there were more than 11 million, according to the most recent data.Some of these families rely on backpack drives and other support from nonprofit or community groups. Many, though, are left seeking the best deals.One big back-to-school item this year: uniforms. Many retailers are promoting them heavily, like Target, which has promoted half-off prices on uniforms.\u201cOur people said that whether it\u2019s Burlington or Target or J. C. Penney or Sears, the uniform section was the hottest part of the competitive space for back to school,\u201d said Craig Johnson, the president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consulting group. \u201cAbout twice as many stores this year as last are doing specials on uniforms.\u201dRetailers who cater to middle-class consumers have been struggling, slashing prices in what has become an aggressive race to the bottom. Sales at traditional department stores have slumped, and once-mighty institutions like Macy\u2019s and Sears have had to close stores.Some retailers have cast a wider net. Jamie Nordstrom, the president of Nordstrom stores, a legacy department store trying to adapt to new consumer tastes, said it had found consumers to want a variety of prices. So for back-to-school, the retailer offers a mix: a $495 Burberry girls\u2019 cross-body bag, next to a $32 backpack and a set of $17 gel pens.\u201cWe don\u2019t think about it as a high-end shopper and a low-end shopper,\u201d Mr. Nordstrom said. \u201cMost people, as they\u2019re living today, they\u2019re wearing high-end and low-end at the same time.\u201dThe income gap plays out in other ways for students, too.Supply lists can vary widely \u2014 it is not uncommon to see USB flash drives, graphing calculators or pocket dictionaries in many wealthier districts. And budget cuts have forced many schools to rely more on parents for what would once have been considered essentials: things like construction paper, tissues or pencils.\u201cThey want like four boxes of crayons, 48 pencils,\u201d said Natalie Pumphrey, a 33-year-old single mother of five from San Antonio, Tex. \u201cI\u2019m having trouble buying school supplies for my own children, and I feel like I\u2019m buying for the whole class.\u201dFactor in extracurricular activities and the difference between the money spent by high- and low-income students is even starker, said Brent Wilder, the corporate public relations director for Huntington National Bank. The company has analyzed back-to-school supply lists from about 30 schools in Ohio and surrounding states every year for the last decade.This year, Huntington estimates that the families of elementary-school-age students will be expected to pay for an average of $659 worth of supplies and fees, while high school students will need $1,498. That is up from $351 and $894 in 2007, the first year the bank began doing the survey.The expenses can go much higher, though. \u201cI\u2019ve seen districts that have $1,500 band fees,\u201d Mr. Wilder said.But the point of the survey, he says, is to make sure people \u2014 especially at the lower-income levels \u2014 know what they will be facing.\u201cWe really wanted to highlight to consumers in our markets that this was an expense that they needed to plan for,\u201d Mr. Wilder said. \u201cThey literally cannot afford to buy classroom supplies and pay all of their bills if they don\u2019t plan ahead.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ursula Le Guin Has Earned a Rare Honor. Just Don\u2019t Call Her a Sci-Fi Writer.", "Date": "2016-08-28", "News": "Supported byPORTLAND, Ore. \u2014 If you\u2019re a big-deal American writer, you hope for a couple of things to cement your legacy. Finding out one fine October morning that your presence is being requested in Sweden would be ideal. Almost as good is enshrinement in the Library of America, the closest thing to immortality between hardcovers.The Library of America usually restricts itself to Melville, Twain, Hawthorne and the other distinguished dead. But a handful of times it has been so sure of a novelist\u2019s importance that its austere black volumes started appearing while the writer was still alive. Eudora Welty, Saul Bellow and Philip Roth got the call.Ursula K. Le Guin is now on this very shortlist. The library\u2019s original idea was to begin with some of her classic science fiction. But she pressed it to start instead with a volume of her lesser-known work.\u201cThere\u2019s some innate arrogance here: I want to do it my way,\u201d Ms. Le Guin said in an interview at her home here. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be reduced to being \u2018the sci-fi writer.\u2019 People are always trying to push me off the literary scene, and to hell with it.\u201dShe chuckled. \u201cI won\u2019t be pushed.\u201dThe result is that Ms. Le Guin\u2019s \u201cThe Complete Orsinia\u201d is being published on Sept. 6 as Library of America Vol. 281. It includes a little-known novel, \u201cMalafrena,\u201d set in an imaginary Central European country, and 13 related stories. The material spans the first half of Ms. Le Guin\u2019s career, from her first published story in 1961 to 1990.It is definitely not science fiction, and not quite fantasy either. Ms. Le Guin\u2019s more casual fans, she acknowledged, might be surprised by it \u2014 a realistic work set in the early 19th century, a tale of a hopeful revolutionary at a moment when revolutions are impossible.\u201cSomeone who pigeonholed me firmly will say, \u2018What the hell?\u2019 But that\u2019s their problem.\u201dMs. Le Guin is 86. She says \u201cwhat the hell\u201d a lot. She is too old, she says, to get on airplanes or even do events in Portland beyond an occasional bookstore appearance. So the world comes to her \u2014 up a hill, past a sign marked \u201cno outlet,\u201d across a bridge spanning a ravine too deep for trolls.Her 1899 house is shielded by pink, yellow and red roses. In the living room there is a volume of word puzzles on a table and the books Ms. Le Guin and her husband, Charles, a retired historian, are reading aloud at night (\u201cTwo Years Before the Mast\u201d and the poetry of Theodore Roethke). There is not a clue that anyone who lives here is a writer, much less America\u2019s greatest living science fiction writer.This early work was done at the margins of the culture. \u201cA Wizard of Earthsea\u201d (1968), now regarded as one of the great fantasies of the era, was published by a small press in Berkeley, Calif. \u201cThe Left Hand of Darkness\u201d (1969), probably her most influential work, was issued as a 95-cent mass-market paperback.\u201cI published as a genre writer when genre was not literature,\u201d she said. \u201cI paid the price, you could say. Don DeLillo, who comes off as literary without question, takes the award over me\u201d \u2014 at the 1985 National Book Awards \u2014 \u201cbecause I published in genre and he didn\u2019t. Also, he\u2019s a man and I\u2019m a woman.\u201d (Mr. DeLillo won for \u201cWhite Noise\u201d; her book, \u201cAlways Coming Home,\u201d was about a far-future California utopia.)Mellowing with age is clearly not Ms. Le Guin\u2019s style. In 2014, she received the National Book Foundation\u2019s Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters. She spent six months writing her six-minute speech.\u201cWho was I to spit in the publishers\u2019 punch bowl at the annual industry party?\u201d she recounts in \u201cWords Are My Matter,\u201d a collection of nonfiction appearing this fall from Small Beer Press. \u201cWell, I was, in fact, the one to do it. So I did it.\u201dShe used her speech to decry \u201ccommodity profiteers\u201d who sold writers \u201clike deodorant, and tell us what to publish, what to write.\u201d She criticized our \u201cobsessive technologies\u201d that promote fear and greed.The speech, and her outrage, went viral. \u201cA writer in her mid-80s simply has less to lose,\u201d she said. \u201cAn author in midcareer who defies the hegemony of Google and Amazon, and names their immoral or unfair practices as such, takes an immediate risk of vengeance from them and of enmity from fellow writers who are cozy with them. I\u2019m taking the same risks, but what the hell. My work is out there \u2014 visible, existent.\u201d\u201cThat story is both a call and a practice for Le Guin,\u201d Mr. Diaz said. \u201cShe has spent all these decades trying to chart a path for those who wish to walk away from Omelas \u2014 also known as the horror of our civilization.\u201d\u201cThe Complete Orsinia\u201d is Ms. Le Guin in a quieter key. \u201cThe editorial challenge of the Library of America is to strike a balance,\u201d said Max Rudin, the library\u2019s publisher. \u201cOn the one hand to publish writers and works that are indisputably part of the American canon, and on the other hand to publish books that stretch people\u2019s imagination of what great American writing is.\u201dIn the introduction, she quotes from a 1975 notebook in which she wrote that much of her work was concerned with one central notion: \u201cTrue pilgrimage consists in coming home.\u201d The hero of \u201cMalafrena\u201d must leave his provincial farm only to find it again.\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between the circle and the spiral,\u201d Ms. Le Guin said. \u201cWe say the Earth has a circular orbit around the sun, but of course it doesn\u2019t. You never come back to the same place, you just come back to the same point on the spiral. That image is very deep in my thinking.\u201d\u201cOrsinia\u201d has another spiral: As Ms. Le Guin\u2019s works are being put in the canon, she has largely stopped writing. \u201cThe fiction isn\u2019t coming. You can\u2019t get water from a dry well.\u201d She still writes poetry, which is a consolation.There remains that other big legacy-cementing possibility. Last year, Ms. Le Guin was given Nobel odds of 25-1. Her conclusion: \u201cAll I have to do in the next 25 years is outlive the other 24 writers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With N.F.L. Deal, Twitter Live-Streams Its Ambitions", "Date": "2016-08-14", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Last March, Twitter and Facebook, along with other tech companies, faced off over which of them would get the rights to live-stream National Football League games on Thursday nights.Twitter, in contrast, agreed to pay the N.F.L. around $10 million to stream 10 games and to sell only a portion of the ad inventory exclusively. Twitter, which is based in San Francisco, wanted the Thursday night games because of their popularity; each game drew an average of 13 million viewers last season.When Twitter streams its first N.F.L. game on Sept. 15, it will get to assess whether its vigorous pursuit will pay off \u2014 and whether live streaming can viably be a linchpin of its future.Since April, Twitter has signed a series of live-streaming deals, including with Wimbledon, CBS News, the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League and Pac-12 Networks. Twitter is also in discussions with other organizations, including Major League Soccer and the Professional Golfers Association, for similar agreements, according to people briefed on the talks.Facebook declined to comment on the N.F.L. talks. In a statement at the time, the N.F.L. commissioner, Roger Goodell, said Twitter \u201cis where live events unfold and is the right partner.\u201d Major League Soccer declined to comment on discussions with Twitter, and the P.G.A. did not respond to requests for comment.For Twitter, the bet on live streaming is crucial to turning itself into a mainstream internet destination after other efforts have failed. Live streaming could finally broaden Twitter\u2019s appeal, attracting an even wider audience. And perhaps more important, live events would be another way to sell video ads. If streaming football or basketball games on Twitter\u2019s mobile apps and on desktop computers, along with other platforms, draws viewers, the company could sell more video ads, which typically command a premium.Twitter has directed Mr. Noto, a former Goldman Sachs banker with deep ties to the sports media industry, to lead the charge on live streaming and has assigned an engineering team to create its streaming video player. Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, considers streaming a critical component of the company\u2019s focus on \u201clive\u201d experiences, along with Periscope, its app that allows smartphone users to live-stream video.To bolster the effort, Twitter is in talks with Apple to bring the Twitter app to Apple TV, which would potentially let millions of Apple TV users watch the streaming N.F.L. games, according to the two people briefed on the discussions.Apple and Twitter declined to comment.Yet even as Twitter increases its live-streaming efforts, so are many of its rivals. Snapchat and Facebook are working on deals with media companies to acquire live-streaming rights to sporting events and entertainment; Instagram is also experimenting with live products. All of the companies are fiercely competing for video advertising dollars, as marketers slowly begin to shift money to online video promotions and away from television ads.There are other hurdles to live streaming, especially from wary content providers who view the technology world with a dose of suspicion.Twitter\u2019s push on live streaming began in late 2014 when Dick Costolo, then the company\u2019s chief executive, called Mr. Noto to discuss how to better use content \u2014 video, text or photos \u2014 to bring people to its service. Over the next 18 months, senior executives at the company debated options. Some batted around the idea of buying Mic, a news website aimed at young audiences, according to a person briefed on the conversations. Others were bullish on video.Eventually, video won out. Mr. Noto said that introducing premium content like sports, politics and entertainment \u2014 the types of programming people often pay to see \u2014 would entice and retain more Twitter users.Even with competition from Snapchat and Facebook, Twitter has a foundation to attract more live-streaming deals. For years, Twitter forged relationships with networks and content owners through a program known as Amplify, in which Twitter worked with TV programmers to distribute short video clips that were preceded by ads sold by both Twitter and the content owners.Twitter is also emphasizing its younger audience as a reason for marketers to advertise on live events. About 72 percent of the social media service\u2019s user base is 18 to 34 years old, according to third-party data and company models, said two people who asked for anonymity because Twitter\u2019s internal metrics were confidential.That focus has in part enabled Twitter to land advertisers like Bank of America for the streaming N.F.L. games.\u201cTwitter really owns those moments that matter to everyone,\u201d said Lou Paskalis, senior vice president for enterprise media planning at Bank of America. \u201cAs a marketer, what we can do with the context that Twitter creates is to join that shared moment.\u201dMr. Noto cautioned that Twitter\u2019s live-streaming strategy was still not fully formed and was just one part of a multipronged plan to remake the company. If live streaming works out, the plan is to make the live videos more easily accessible on Twitter \u2014 whether through notifications in the main timeline or through a mobile tab in Twitter\u2019s app called Moments, said two people briefed on the company\u2019s product plans.But first comes the N.F.L. game next month between the New York Jets and the Buffalo Bills, which will be live-streamed from Buffalo.\u201cOur opportunity is to use these familiar platforms that people understand, like streaming video, as a window into seeing everything else we really have available,\u201d Mr. Noto said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Think Tank Scholar or Corporate Consultant? It Depends on the Day", "Date": "2016-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Over the many months that officials in Washington debated sweeping new regulations for internet providers, Jeffrey A. Eisenach, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, was hard to miss.And he has plenty of company.An examination of 75 think tanks found an array of researchers who had simultaneously worked as registered lobbyists, members of corporate boards or outside consultants in litigation and regulatory disputes, with only intermittent disclosure of their dual roles.With their expertise and authority, think tank scholars offer themselves as independent arbiters, playing a vital role in Washington\u2019s political economy. Their imprimatur helps shape government decisions that can be lucrative to corporations.But the examination identified dozens of examples of scholars conducting research at think tanks while corporations were paying them to help shape government policy. Many think tanks also readily confer \u201cnonresident scholar\u201d status on lobbyists, former government officials and others who earn their primary living working for private clients, with few restrictions on such outside work.Largely free from disclosure requirements, the researchers\u2019 work is often woven into elaborate corporate lobbying campaigns.And it is a decidedly bipartisan practice.The overlapping roles are often not made clear, and even members of Congress say they are frequently unaware of the financial ties between industries and the witnesses with think tank titles appearing before them at hearings.\u201cThey can make a very deceptive and false claim to credibility that is totally lacking,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who said he had become increasingly disturbed by the role of think tank experts on Capitol Hill. \u201cI think about it every time there is a witness now from a \u2018think tank,\u2019 putting that term in very boldface quotes.\u201dScholars sometimes include general references to their private-sector work in their official biographies. Mr. Eisenach, for example, notes that he is an executive at NERA Economic Consulting in addition to his position at the American Enterprise Institute. And when a private company pays him or his consulting firm to publish a study, he discloses the name of the corporate sponsor on the study.But there is no way for the public or policy makers to know Mr. Eisenach\u2019s full roster of NERA clients. And there is no comprehensive disclosure of these clients when he writes his think tank reports or academic papers, testifies before Congress, or meets with F.C.C. members or staff.Mr. Eisenach declined repeated requests to comment in detail. But a spokeswoman for the American Enterprise Institute, Judy Mayka Stecker, said she saw no conflict in his roles.\u201cWe believe in the open competition of ideas and encourage our scholars to engage with experts from all sectors and viewpoints,\u201d she said.A footnote on the first page of the letter indicated that none of the scholars who signed had been compensated by stakeholder companies. But of the dozen studies they submitted as evidence, more than half had been funded by telecommunications giants or based on other work for the companies, industry ties that were disclosed only in footnotes in the original studies.No federal rules required broader disclosure. Yet on many highly technical policy issues like telecommunications regulation, scholarship is dominated by industry-funded research, according to a review of hundreds of studies, regulatory filings and other documents.\u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re in legal and you want to have a paper that says what you want it to say,\u201d said Dennis Weller, a former Verizon economist who occasionally consults for telecommunications companies and international organizations. \u201cYou could have a bunch of economists in house and ask them if they agree with you. How much easier would it be to go to an outside economist and say, \u2018How about if I pay you $100,000 to write this?\u2019\u201dFew policy battles have had higher stakes in recent years than the debate over net neutrality \u2014 a catchall term for proposals to restrict internet service providers from blocking websites or regulating speed.To bolster their claims that the regulations would hurt consumers, companies have financed research that contends the rules would reduce investment in new services and raise prices. That work is used to shape the public debate and to build an industry-funded narrative in the regulatory record, one that the F.C.C. is required by law to evaluate.Industry-sponsored research has also figured prominently in court battles over F.C.C. efforts to regulate the internet. When Verizon successfully opposed an earlier F.C.C. rule on net neutrality, more than half of the 23 studies or expert declarations cited in court filings had been sponsored directly by telecommunications companies or trade associations, according to an analysis by The Times. Other studies had been published under the banner of think tanks but written by scholars who consulted extensively for companies.The attacks began to grow particularly heated nearly two years ago, when Mr. Obama called on Mr. Wheeler and his fellow F.C.C. commissioners to regulate the internet like traditional phone lines.The study mentioned their employment at Economists Incorporated, a consulting firm in Washington. But a reader would have had to do more research to learn that Economists Incorporated\u2019s clients included AT&T and Verizon, companies leading the industry\u2019s charge against the commission proposal. That was disclosed on a \u201cselect client list\u201d on the Economists Incorporated website.\u201cPeople who are running advertisements are not going to say, \u2018In a study we paid for,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Litan, now an adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cIn the public discourse, the disclaimers often do get dropped.\u201d\u201cNone of us works for free,\u201d Mr. Singer wrote. \u201cSo let\u2019s focus on the merits & be nice to each other!\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Singer said he \u2014 like most scholars \u2014 disclosed when a client commissioned a particular study published through his consulting firm. Most specialists in the telecommunications field, he suggested, are well aware of his business connections and views on regulatory issues.\u201cEverybody is on different teams,\u201d Mr. Singer said. \u201cSo long as you tell the audience what team you are on, you can then offer the opinions. Disclosure is the antidote to all of this.\u201dFew scholars have been as active in the net neutrality debate as Mr. Eisenach.\u201cJeff is good at linking big theoretical ideas to policy, and he\u2019s been good at making money doing that,\u201d said Mr. Weller, the former Verizon economist. \u201cHe\u2019s been good at moving from think tank to think tank and company to company, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever lost money doing it.\u201dAt a given moment, it can be difficult to determine which hat Mr. Eisenach is wearing.In September 2014, at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on net neutrality, the formal meeting agenda listed Mr. Eisenach as a visiting scholar at the institute.Scholar, consultant, expert witness \u2014 Jeffrey A. Eisenach has worn all these hats while playing a leading role in the debate over telecommunications policy in the United States. Here is a look at the potential conflicts that this situation creates for Mr. Eiensach, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.He then detailed his vehement opposition to further federal regulation of the internet.Mr. Eisenach was similarly ambiguous when he interacted with members of the F.C.C., according to dozens of emails obtained by The Times, all but one of which was sent from Mr. Eisenach\u2019s email address at the American Enterprise Institute.On behalf of the think tank, he sought meetings with F.C.C. commissioners and lawyers to discuss the rules, and briefed the commission\u2019s Republican members on what its general counsel was telling him about Mr. Wheeler\u2019s thinking. Mr. Eisenach offered speaking slots at American Enterprise Institute events to the two Republican members on the commission, urging one to use a January 2015 forum to speak out against the proposed regulations.Ms. Stecker, the institute spokeswoman, said it should be no surprise that the opinions of experts like Mr. Eisenach were in demand. The think tank requires scholars to submit an annual report on any \u201coutside activities,\u201d she added, and A.E.I. has \u201cnot as an institution sought to influence or constrain\u201d this work.While private consulting arrangements can leave scholars\u2019 ties to corporate interests murky, the conflict is more apparent when think tank researchers do double duty as registered lobbyists.Mr. Verdery, a former senior official at the Department of Homeland Security whose office helped run the inspection program at foreign airports, briefly mentioned that in addition to his status as a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, he was the founder of the Monument Policy Group.Officials at the Toronto airport, with Mr. Verdery\u2019s help, have been trying to persuade the American authorities to increase staff and equipment to reduce bottlenecks sometimes created by the preclearance program.Asked whether it was appropriate for a lobbyist to host his clients at a think tank event, Mr. Verdery said, \u201cIt is fairly typical.\u201dMr. Verdery is not paid by the think tank, he noted. He does benefit from the C.S.I.S. title, however, when laying out a client\u2019s case.As of late last year, at least 70 unpaid senior advisers and associates listed on the think tank\u2019s website had simultaneously worked as consultants. Seven others listed as C.S.I.S. senior advisers or associates during the past five years had worked as registered corporate lobbyists while holding the positions.Officials at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, when asked about Mr. Verdery, said his December presentation should not have occurred.\u201cThis event did not meet our standards of transparency and integrity,\u201d the think tank said in a statement in response to questions. \u201cThis constituted a lapse in oversight from C.S.I.S.\u201dMr. Verdery is no longer listed among the think tank\u2019s senior associates.Bruce Bartlett, a scholar who has worked at the Cato Institute and the Heritage Foundation, said it was becoming the norm in Washington for lobbyists and consultants like Mr. Verdery to vie for nonresident scholar posts to help them burnish sales pitches to corporate clients.\u201cClients prefer it that way,\u201d Mr. Bartlett said. \u201cThey get a chance to have their work done by scholars.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think they see any downside,\u201d Mr. Miller said of his corporate clients and the think tank.While Mr. Miller is not well known, he has high-profile company.Mr. Dorgan did not immediately register as a lobbyist, but his firm has oil and gas industry clients.Asked if his dual role represented a conflict of interest, Mr. Dorgan said that the premise of the Bipartisan Policy Center was \u201cto bring interested parties together to find solutions to difficult problems,\u201d and that he was proud to work there.Mr. Zakheim, of the American Enterprise Institute, is also a lobbyist at Covington & Burling L.L.P., where, on behalf of BAE Systems, he is urging Congress and the Defense Department to increase spending on ground combat vehicles that the company manufactures. Other clients include Northrop Grumman, which is building a new long-range Air Force bomber.Some scholars add another twist: They serve on corporate boards directly related to their areas of expertise at think tanks.Dr. McClellan, a former commissioner at the Food and Drug Administration who until January was a senior fellow at Brookings, has been a go-to expert for the federal government as it debates how to cope with surging costs of prescription drugs.At public events, Dr. McClellan emphasized the extraordinary progress by the pharmaceutical industry in coming up with treatments for diseases like diabetes, H.I.V. and hepatitis C.Dr. McClellan, in a statement, disputed any suggestion that he might have had a conflict.\u201cMy entire career in academics, government and public policy has focused on evidence-based ways to improve health and restrain costs for consumers, and my extensive track record speaks for itself,\u201d he said.She said that her change of heart on nuclear power had predated her engagement with Nuclear Matters, and was motivated by her desire to combat climate change, not by payment from the industry.\u201cObviously, the single most important thing any individual has is their reputation,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cI have worked really hard to be forthcoming about what I stand for and believe in. I am who I am.\u201dAdam S. Posen, the president of the Peterson Institute, considered the world\u2019s pre-eminent think tank on global economics, has a commanding view of the construction of the new headquarters for the American Enterprise Institute, as well as the main office of Brookings. In his office, he recently had a series of uncomfortable conversations with three scholars he had decided to let go.After much internal debate, Mr. Posen decided to formally prohibit Peterson\u2019s scholars from holding outside jobs that directly related to the field they wrote about on behalf of the think tank.The three who had such outside engagements were terminated.Mr. Posen noted that the change did not imply the researchers had done anything wrong. But tighter rules are needed, he said, to respond to a growing sense he shares with the Peterson board that the think tank industry must reassert its commitment to impartiality.\u201cI live in a glass house,\u201d said Mr. Posen, a Harvard-trained economist who previously served on the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England, gesturing toward the floor-to-ceiling glass that provides him stunning views.\u201cOur reputation is built on our credibility,\u201d Mr. Posen said. \u201cWithout being perceived as credible and objective, our studies just get thrown on the scrap heap.\u201dThe Urban Institute, a Washington-based think tank that focuses on issues confronting cities, has decided to require that its scholars with any outside jobs detail the relationship in their writings.And at Brookings, executives imposed new rules in December requiring that unpaid nonresident scholars use their title from any paying job, not from Brookings, if they testify before Congress. They are also prohibited from using their affiliation with Brookings in any research report they publish under contract with an outside party.\u201cI\u2019ve moved on to other issues,\u201d Mr. Eisenach said.\u201cIt has gotten to the point where everyone in Washington has their own expert,\u201d Mr. Medvetz said. \u201cIt is yet another reflection of the tremendous influence of economic power in American politics \u2014 as with money, you can create your own vehicles of political influence.\u201dStill, not everyone is worried about the multiple roles played by think tank scholars.\u201cEveryone\u2019s got their point of view,\u201d Mr. Walden said in an interview last year. \u201cAnd some of them get paid to have that point of view.\u201dBrooke Williams is a reporter at the New England Center for Investigative Reporting, which collaborated with The New York Times on this series.

Inspired by the arrival of the small Google Cardboard VR viewer that came in home-delivery subscribers\u2019 Sunday papers of Nov. 8, 2015, Mr. Letizia immediately began planning classroom applications for reading and writing with the new technology.We love how he introduces his students to VR as a \u201cpowerful empathy engine\u201d for understanding the lives of others, and we hope his forays will encourage other teachers to try the technology too.moreWhat Mr. Letizia Did and Why, in His Own WordsVR as a Springboard for Reading and Writing InstructionOn a cold day in early November I went outside to grab our New York Times from the driveway and noticed a large cardboard box attached to the iconic blue bag. That Sunday, The Times Magazine featured three pieces about children driven from their homes by war and persecution \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an 11-year-old boy from eastern Ukraine named Oleg, a 12-year-old Syrian girl named Hana and a 9-year-old South Sudanese boy named Chuol.I vividly remember standing in my kitchen with my wife and three children as we each took turns eagerly trying on the goggles and watching the short VR video of an airdrop of food in Somalia. I had chills while I looked around and saw people running to collect rice bags being dropped at my feet.It was a moment I will not forget, for in that moment I knew the future, my children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future, would look vastly different than mine had at that age. It must have been like the excitement my grandparents had when TV shifted to color. More important, I realized what awesome implications these devices would have on my teaching. That Monday I brought my pair of goggles in and a few pairs I borrowed  from my neighbors to share the experience with my students. The objective of the first lesson was pretty simple: share this cool new experience with students. Lesson ProcedureThis is a series of inquiries that students can make about the content they are reading. The strategy is designed to encourage students to think beyond the words on the page and to consider the author\u2019s intent for the selection and his or her success at communicating it. The guiding idea behind the lesson came from the article:Especially as a medium for non-fiction, I believe the hype that VR can act as a powerful empathy engine, a uniquely direct way to put us in someone else\u00e2\u0080\u0099s world.Students completed the following \u201cQ the Author\u201d questions:Four Borrowed Goggles Is Not Enough: Going FurtherThe challenge of having only four goggles to share among six classes and over 50 students was logistically daunting, to say the least. We put the VR Lessons on hold until I could figure out a way to address the issue. We decided to launch The Times\u00e2\u0080\u0099s virtual-reality efforts with these portraits because we recognize that this new filmmaking technology enables an uncanny feeling of connection with people whose lives are far from our own.We discussed this quote and how it relates to our previous quote. My students are middle-schoolers and instantly made connections to the three portraits The Times Magazine highlighted in the series:Going Further: Debating the VR Technology Having explored the argument that VR technology can increase empathy by placing us in a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s world, we moved on to what others think of the technology. Other VR ApplicationsBesides the obvious benefits for teaching empathy, I have found the VR goggles have been a great springboard for reading and writing lessons. They add another dimension to reading and writing activities and serve as a great motivator. Even when the VR goggles are just a small part of the lesson (five to 10 minutes), students get excited about the topic. I imagine as the technology advances and more apps and videos are created the classroom implications will continue to expand. As The Times continues to create VR reporting, my students will continue to use it to explore the world.

{"Headline": "Cloud Computing Brings Sprawling Centers, but Few Jobs, to Small Towns", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "Supported byBoydton JournalBOYDTON, Va. \u2014 A giant Microsoft facility just outside this very small town hides behind a quarter-mile berm and a guard house, across the highway from the rubble of a demolished prison.Behind the berm, six unmarked hangars each hold tens of thousands of computer servers. Microsoft has cleared enough scrub trees and vines for at least 15 of these buildings, and six more are already under construction.One thing there isn\u2019t much of at this Microsoft complex, one single computer data center, is long-term work. Microsoft says it might have \u201cseveral dozen\u201d employees in a place like this. They are mostly elite computer workers who tend not to come from Boydton, which lost a lot of good jobs when nearby factories closed and the prison shut down.So it is in a number of small towns across the country, as technology giants like Amazon, Google and Microsoft race to build networks of unprecedented size to provide services over the internet, a technology trend known as cloud computing. Local people, along with many economists and officials, often think these data centers are a key to an industrial revival. But the reality is less impressive.\u201cI\u2019ve worked on a lot of nuclear power plants, and these things are a lot bigger than that,\u201d said E. W. Gregory, the head of the local electrical workers\u2019 union. But \u201cthe first thing they put in was a guard shack and a fence. I\u2019ve filled rooms with people looking for entry-level work. None of it lasts.\u201dThe companies come to places like Boydton for basics like land, water and electricity. Even with low local wages, people are a high-cost item. As small as the staffs at these mammoth facilities are, companies say, perhaps a third of the company jobs will eventually be filled by robots.Google started building in eastern Oregon to be near cheap hydroelectric power on the Columbia River, and most recently it has focused on Iowa, Alabama and Tennessee. Microsoft has a center in Wyoming, and it bought a nine-hole golf course as part of a complex near West Des Moines, Iowa. Amazon recently built similar giant facilities on the outer reaches of Columbus, Ohio, and Dulles, Va.\u201cA lot of this stuff is put in rural parts of the country that used to be part of a manufacturing economy\u201d that has gone overseas, said Bill Coughran, a partner at the venture investment firm Sequoia Capital who ran much of Google\u2019s big engineering for eight years. \u201cTextiles and furniture created a big power grid in the south. Then those jobs went away.\u201dThat\u2019s been the story for Boydton, population 430, in the middle of tobacco country a few miles from the North Carolina border. The prison across from the Microsoft center closed in 2012. A nearby Burlington Industries textile plant that employed more than 2,000 shut in 2002. It was razed in 2012.The South Virginia tobacco economy collapsed as Americans cut back on smoking. But in 1999, Virginia used some of the $4.1 billion it received in a settlement with cigarette makers to build high-speed fiber-optic lines throughout the region.The broadband drew Microsoft, along with some financial perks. Mecklenburg County, which received $2.1 million from the state for the project, has given Microsoft 350 acres and offset personal property taxes by 82.5 percent, according to Wayne Carter, the county administrator.Initially, Apple, which is building a big cloud center for consumers\u2019 photos and music, wanted the Boydton site, but it went across the border to North Carolina, which promised tax breaks on its data center equipment. Not to be outdone, Virginia passed laws in 2009 and 2010 that exempted sales taxes on things like data center computer servers, software, power generators and chillers to cool all that equipment.\u201cWe\u2019ve had six years of construction work,\u201d said Mr. Carter. That has helped the county, he said, because even temporary workers rent houses, stay in hotels and eat in local restaurants.Microsoft did not dispute reports that it would spend $1.1 billion on the Boydton data center, and said that \u201con average, data centers employ tens to several dozen people,\u201d in a mixture of corporate and contracted positions. It declined to let a reporter tour the site.\u201cThey talked about 100 jobs, but it\u2019s a slow process,\u201d said Thomas C. Coleman III, the mayor of Boydton. So far, he says, the biggest impact \u201chas been a couple of lunch tables at the Triangle gas station.\u201dHe understates matters, but not by much. Mr. Gregory, the electrician, said his union had hundreds of applicants for work digging ditches and laying pipe, starting at $10.88 an hour. Wiring paid $28.59. Both jobs tended to last about six months, he said, with lots of attrition for the hard outdoor labor.Working as a security guard or as someone testing the wires inside the data center offers better money, but there are not many positions. Microsoft prefers to fly in its own specialists for some work, and it doesn\u2019t like hiring people who have worked in other big companies\u2019 cloud-computing centers, Mr. Gregory said. (Microsoft said it did not exclude candidates based on previous experience.)\u201cWe can provide a place to live, but all those contractors will move on to the next town where they\u2019re building,\u201d Mr. Coleman said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you can count on.\u201dThe big cloud networks are immensely profitable for the few companies who can operate these global systems. The biggest three cloud companies estimate that the global market in business computing is worth $1 trillion or more, and they are rushing to expand globally. In interviews, all said they spend more than $2 billion annually on this.\u201cIt\u2019s phenomenal how rapidly they are growing,\u201d said Erik Brynjolfsson, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has written extensively on the impact of new technologies. \u201cIt is the key enabler of all kinds of technology advances, starting with the things companies do now, but lots cheaper, including outsourcing tech jobs.\u201dThat is hard to imagine in places where local roots go so deep. Conversations here usually start with people explaining where they are from, and what their families did here for generations. \u201cBoydton is the quintessential quaint courthouse town,\u201d said Leigh Lambert, the town librarian. \u201cPeople from here love it. It feels like it\u2019s always with you.\u201dMs. Lambert grew up nearby, tried New York, and returned to work next to the court, which is adorned with a statue of a Confederate soldier. Microsoft initially came to a couple of town meetings, and it seemed to offer a way Boydton could come back. \u201cNow they\u2019re off by themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cWe hear they have a really nice Starbucks machine.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Squeeze These Places In", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Getaway\u201cWhat\u2019s new in town?\u201d is an innocent enough question, unless you ask it in a city hosting the Olympics, where a complete answer might stretch out longer than the 50-kilometer race walk.First-time visitors to Rio de Janeiro may barely have enough time to slip in a cable car ride to Sugarloaf Mountain and a passion fruit caipirinha on Ipanema Beach between days of kayak slalom and Greco-Roman wrestling. But for those who have done the basics, here are some great new additions to the city:It\u2019s a captivating little \u2026 museum? Gallery? The website calls it a \u201cmarketing platform for the repositioning and classification of Brazilian handicrafts.\u201d That\u2019s lame. But Ricardo Withers, a salesman in the gift shop explained: \u201cUnlike in beachside or country houses,\u201d where such work is normally found, \u201cwe display them as luxury items \u2014 design items.\u201dTwo new tools make visiting favelas easier. One is the \u201cPocket Guide,\u201d a compact, free booklet with lists of restaurants, bars, hostels and phone numbers of local guides, as well as rough maps of over a dozen communities that are generally safe to visit. (You can find them at tourist stands or visitefavelario.com.br.) The other is the enhanced data on Google Maps, which has worked with a local nonprofit to map the streets and businesses in 26 favelas.I tested both at the Chap\u00e9u Mangueira and Babil\u00f4nia communities above the Leme neighborhood and found each very helpful. They\u2019re incomplete \u2014 the winding passages and narrow staircases that stand in for streets are impossible to document fully. Additional help from residents bridged the gaps.Still, the temporary exhibition \u201cChrist the Redeemer \u2013 Divine Geometry\u201d (along with its park setting) made it my favorite find. On display is Oskar Metsavaht\u2019s examination of the Art Deco statue that soars over the city (and for the next few weeks, onto your televisions), which includes everything from yellowing newspaper clips and construction materials Mr. Metsavaht (also the founder of the Osklen clothing brand) found in the museum archives to his own photography, mixed-media and video art.Mr. Calatrava\u2019s soaring skeletal structure has been compared variously to a dinosaur skeleton, a dish-drying rack, and (because it\u2019s by the same architect) the entrance to the World Trade Center PATH station.Though the theme \u2014 essentially the future of life on this planet \u2014 was worthwhile and the displays thought-provoking, my experience visiting three weeks before the Games was exasperating.The ribbed roof over the entrance absorbs solar power, but not enough to stop the sun from making me miserable in a long shadeless line. Once inside, I should have skipped a second line to what I thought was the main exhibition but turned out to be for an introductory film in Portuguese. (The rest of the exhibition is trilingual, with English and Spanish.) Museum officials later told me that they plan to improve signage and will eliminate lines outside during the Games by restricting entrance to those who buy timed tickets online. Alas, up until press time that could only be done in Portuguese.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Car Renter\u2019s Costly Detour to Collection Center Drive", "Date": "2016-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe HagglerThis isn\u2019t unusual. When any business appears in this highly uncoveted space, readers often pipe up with letters in the \u201cThat happened to me, too!\u201d vein. The difference here is that new Payless letters describe behavior even more egregious than that previously described here, and that makes a return to the subject somewhat irresistible. You will note this letter goes on at a slightly greater than average length. That is because it contains a slightly greater than average amount of crazy.Q. In April, when I made a Payless Car Rental reservation online, the estimate for seven days was $256. When I got to the Austin, Tex., airport, an employee at the Payless counter asked a few times if I wanted personal liability insurance. I declined it, over and over.But when I returned the car a week later, my bill was $527. The reason? I\u2019d been charged for that insurance and other add-ons that I had said I didn\u2019t want. When I pointed this out to the woman behind the counter \u2014 the same woman who had rented me the car a week earlier \u2014 she said she lacked the authority to remove any charges.Then she did something odd: She took the contract to a back office and never returned with it. Instead, she emerged with a phone number and suggested I call to complain.I disputed the charge with American Express. On June 1, I was informed that the dispute was resolved in my favor and that $222 would be refunded. (Why that figure, and not more, I don\u2019t know.) Payless was undeterred. A week later, I received a letter from the company with the words \u201cDebit advice\u201d written over and over. The address I was told to send money to was \u2014 and this is not a joke \u2014 32961 Collection Center Drive, Chicago, Ill.Worried about my credit rating, I sent the company a certified check. It was cashed.Amazingly, a week later I received another letter, once again demanding that I send a check for $222. Or else.\u201cYour cooperation in this matter is important to continue uninterrupted service of your rental needs,\u201d the letter stated. \u201cIf there is no response within 10 days we will have no alternative but to suspend your rental privileges.\u201dI called the contact person named on the letter, left a message and have heard nothing back.Perhaps the Haggler could get to the bottom of this.A. It\u2019s hard to know where to begin.Suspending your \u201crental privileges?\u201d It seems to the Haggler that this threat would work only on consumers under the mistaken impression that Payless is the only car rental company in the United States.\u201cCollection Center Drive\u201d? Google Maps can\u2019t find it. The Haggler has to assume that the point of this address, along with \u201cDebit advice\u201d \u2014 a phrase that doesn\u2019t make sense \u2014 is to imply that a customer is about to have a collection agency problem.Payless, readers may recall, is owned by Avis Budget, which is based in Parsippany-Troy Hills, N.J. The company\u2019s chief executive is Larry D. De Shon. Avis acquired Payless in 2013, for $50 million, which means that Mr. De Shon and his colleagues have had three years to bring Payless service up to Avis standards \u2014 which are high, in the Haggler\u2019s personal experience.The Haggler contacted Avis Budget\u2019s public relations office and heard from Alice Pereira, a spokeswoman. She was forwarded a copy of the contract and copies of all the letters involved in this dispute. Two weeks later, the Haggler had heard nothing back. After a nudge, Ms. Pereira wrote this email, transcribed in its entirety: \u201cWe have worked directly with the customer to resolve the issue.\u201dThe Haggler was amazed that Payless was not eager, at minimum, to fake some concern. He wrote to Ms. Pereira and urged her to be a bit more expansive. A few days later, she wrote that the company had been working to integrate Payless, efforts that include an upgrade to its fleet and \u201cthe implementation of more standard servicing requirements for those vehicles.\u201dMs. Pereira also stated that Ms. Bertucio had initialed the part of the contract where personal liability insurance is requested. This is true. But Ms. Bertucio did that only after she\u2019d explained that she didn\u2019t want that insurance, and thought her initials merely confirmed that fact.In other words, Ms. Bertucio thinks she was snookered. It seemed to the Haggler that it would behoove Avis Budget to look into the matter. Would Ms. Pereira and the company like to investigate and then send yet another statement?\u201cWe pay close attention to input and feedback from our customers,\u201d Ms. Pereira wrote two days later. \u201cWe will use this rental transaction as an opportunity to reinforce with our associates, at our Payless location in Austin and elsewhere, the importance of ensuring that our customers clearly understand which services and options they are selecting.\u201dTo the Haggler\u2019s ears, this is low on specifics and missing the sincere sense of regret and urgency that this column occasionally hears from companies that want to improve. But another pep talk followed by a another request for yet another statement seemed pointless. Because if Payless is still demanding that customers send money they don\u2019t owe to a street called Collection Center Drive, it has problems that Avis Budget isn\u2019t eager to solve.EMAIL: haggler@nytimes.com or tweet to @TheHagglerNYT.

{"Headline": "Airbnb for Business Travelers: More Wi-Fi, Fewer Hosts in Towels", "Date": "2016-08-15", "News": "Supported byItinerariesWhether traveling for business or pleasure, Tad Milbourn, chief executive of the San Francisco technology start-up Payable, stays at an Airbnb property whenever possible.\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely the coolest, being in someone\u2019s house as opposed to a hotel,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s superior, from the price, experience and novelty standpoint.\u201dBecause Payable helps clients manage payments, Mr. Milbourn is particularly attuned to the services Airbnb has developed for business travelers, and he encourages his two employees who travel to use Airbnb and its services too. These include the ability to track employees\u2019 whereabouts and spending and to charge expenses to a corporate credit card.Mr. Milbourn is one of many business travelers now choosing Airbnb or other home-sharing services, like HomeAway and VRBO, over conventional hotels.A report issued last month by Concur, a travel and expense management company, found that the number of nights that its 42 million business travel customers spent in home-sharing accommodations rose more than 50 percent from the first quarter of 2015 to the first quarter of this year.Airbnb is actively cultivating this clientele, having recently reached agreements with three big business travel management companies in the United States: American Express Global Business Travel, BCD Travel and Carlson Wagonlit Travel.Under these agreements, Airbnb will send data on travelers\u2019 expenditures and itineraries to the travel management companies, which in turn will share the information with the travelers\u2019 employers, their clients. The employers can then use this data to monitor employees\u2019 spending and travel and to track them down, as needed, if there is an emergency.But some business travelers who have used Airbnb, especially those whose bosses booked the accommodations for them, warn that bad surprises can sometimes await.Alexa Pothier, a Boston-based consultant for a Palo Alto, Calif., software company, who has used Airbnb occasionally during vacations with generally positive results, had a different outcome on a business trip in 2014 when she stayed at a one-bedroom apartment in the Shoreditch neighborhood of London.The host owned a small business in a storefront on the ground floor, which Ms. Pothier had to walk through to reach the stairs to the apartment. Although the apartment had a large living space, where Ms. Pothier said she could work comfortably, she was startled by a mouse that \u201cearly on scampered very quickly across the couch.\u201dAnd the bedroom window overlooked a noisy street, which forced her to use earplugs that the host had left in a bowl next to the bed.When Katie Gilligan, a New Yorker and a former account manager for a London-based ticket-booking service, traveled to London last year on business, her boss put her up for a week each at two apartments booked through Airbnb.The second apartment, in the King\u2019s Cross neighborhood, was owned by a woman who shared the living space and would not let Ms. Gilligan use the water or flush the toilet after 8 p.m. The host also walked around wearing only a towel, Ms. Gilligan said, \u201ctalking to me about her life experience and about aliens coming down and probing people.\u201dAll the more reason, perhaps, to use Airbnb\u2019s business travel services that include \u201cbusiness travel ready\u201d listings \u2014 accommodations geared toward business travelers\u2019 specific needs.To qualify, a lodging must meet various criteria, including high customer ratings; 24-hour check-in; accommodations that are an entire home or apartment, not shared with the owner; the availability of Wi-Fi and a laptop-friendly work space; and an iron, a hair dryer and other amenities.Chip Conley, head of global hospitality and strategy for Airbnb, said that more than 70,000 companies had made bookings through Airbnb for Business, a program introduced last year that features listings and travel management tools.Not all of those companies, however, are as willing as Payable to talk about their use of Airbnb.Some of the prominent companies that Mr. Conley and others at Airbnb have cited as business travel customers \u2014 including Facebook and Google \u2014 declined to discuss the topic for this article. And many of the companies that were willing, including Morgan Stanley, Salesforce, Twilio and TBWA, had other business relationships with Airbnb.Some professionals in the business travel industry acknowledge the potential benefits of using services like Airbnb, and see some of the drawbacks.Airbnb\u2019s affordable offerings could help budget-conscious attendees of conventions and meetings, Deborah Sexton, president and chief executive of the Professional Convention Management Association, said in an email. Home-sharing accommodations can also offer an attractive alternative when hotel rooms are sold out, she said.Depending on its location, an Airbnb property might not be the most convenient option for a business traveler, particularly someone attending a conference or convention, Ms. Sexton said.\u201cOne of the biggest perks of a host hotel is its central location,\u201d she said. \u201cFor attendees who stay at Airbnb properties in different neighborhoods, getting to an early-morning conference or attending a late-night evening reception may be more difficult.\u201dMs. Sexton and some other experts also raised safety and legal concerns.Although Airbnb offers host protection insurance, which provides primary coverage for Airbnb hosts and landlords in more than 15 countries against liability claims of up to $1 million, the coverage does not apply to liability from assault and battery, sexual abuse or molestation, or to acts of terrorism, among other events.William A. Brewer III, a lawyer in New York and Dallas who represents hotel owners \u2014 typically some of Airbnb\u2019s staunchest opponents \u2014 said hotel owners, managers and franchisers had an obligation to reduce foreseeable risks. For the traveler, he said, the question is whether the providers of lodging have a balance sheet strong enough to pay for their negligence if trouble occurs.\u201cI believe this is why businesses often place their faith in well-known hotel chains when booking employee travel,\u201d he added.But those concerns might be offset, Mr. Brewer said, if a traveler were on a long-term assignment and the employer could cut costs significantly by booking an Airbnb property. In this case, he said, the employer could find it worthwhile to \u201cexpend the amount of effort required for due diligence to offset any liability issues.\u201dAirbnb has sued San Francisco over a June decision by the city\u2019s Board of Supervisors to fine the company $1,000 a day for every unregistered host on its service.That followed a bipartisan move by New York lawmakers, who voted to heavily fine anyone who used Airbnb to rent an entire apartment for fewer than 30 days \u2014 a practice that has been illegal in the state since 2010.Nick Papas, an Airbnb spokesman, said the company would not let those disputes deter its efforts to cultivate a business traveler clientele. \u201cThus far, we\u2019ve seen that business and leisure travelers remain eager to use Airbnb in New York and San Francisco,\u201d he said.Bjorn Hanson, a professor at the Tisch Center for Hospitality and Tourism at New York University, said the travel management companies\u2019 agreements with Airbnb showed that they were \u201ceffectively endorsing\u201d Airbnb.\u201cThis changes the debate\u201d that Airbnb is having with New York and San Francisco, he said, and gives \u201cmuch more weight to Airbnb\u2019s side.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Daily Report: A New Android for a New Tech World", "Date": "2016-08-23", "News": "Supported byBitsWith little notice, Google just told us a lot about our world.Google first talked about the new OS, called Nougat, last March, and gave people the opportunity to download an early version of the software. Google appears to have used that feedback heavily in the final version.What\u2019s the single best question about money that anyone has ever asked you \u2014 or that you\u2019ve asked of a spouse, family member or loved one? And what was the conversation that ensued?Not so long ago, a new computer OS was a huge deal, developed in secret and released with a marketing thunderclap. That was when personal computers were the rule, or PC-type thinking dominated phone marketing. Now speed, feedback and continuous upgrades are the rule.Nougat will appear as an update on a handful of Nexus phones over the next few weeks, and later on a new phone. It is said to have 250 new features, but is unlikely to require a lot of new learning, unlike new versions of Windows on a PC.People don\u2019t have time for that now; if things aren\u2019t more intuitive, they are discarded.Personalization is also a big feature of these mass-market devices, so the phone can do things like provide polyglots with search results in multiple languages, ways to reconfigure Quick Settings controls or 1,500 different emoji for nonverbal communication.Besides feedback and customization, speed is another design principle that has become paramount. Apps can run side by side, notifications can open apps directly and previously used apps can be easily reopened.If saving seconds sounds like a big deal, it is: Google long ago discovered that even a 200-millisecond delay can make a search seem too slow. That impatience is now a consumer norm.So much for the present state of tech design. Nougat also has a couple of indications about what\u2019s next, in the form of augmented reality and virtual reality functions. A lot of that will be dormant for now, until new games, and hardware like headphones and game controllers, become available.It\u2019s O.K. if you start getting impatient for that stuff. After all, by the time you read this, Nougat will have been out for an entire day or more.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China, Not Silicon Valley, Is Cutting Edge in Mobile Tech", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAll of these developments have something in common: The technology was first popularized in China.Silicon Valley has long been the world\u2019s tech capital: It birthed social networking and iPhones and spread those tech products across the globe. The rap on China has been that it always followed in the Valley\u2019s footsteps as government censorship abetted the rise of local versions of Google, YouTube and Twitter.But China\u2019s tech industry \u2014 particularly its mobile businesses \u2014 has in some ways pulled ahead of the United States. Some Western tech companies, even the behemoths, are turning to Chinese firms for ideas.\u201cWe just see China as further ahead,\u201d said Ted Livingston, the founder of Kik, which is headquartered in Waterloo, Ontario.The shift suggests that China could have a greater say in the global tech industry\u2019s direction. Already in China, more people use their mobile devices to pay their bills, order services, watch videos and find dates than anywhere else in the world. Mobile payments in the country last year surpassed those in the United States. By some estimates, loans from a new breed of informal online banks called peer-to-peer lenders did too.The future of online payments and engagements can be found at Liu Zheng\u2019s noodle shop in central Beijing. Liu Xiu\u2019e, 60, and her neighbor, Zhang Lixin, 55, read about the noodle shop on WeChat. Then they ordered and paid for their lunches and took and posted selfies of themselves outside the restaurant, all using the same app.Liu Zheng, who is not related to Liu Xiu\u2019e, said the automated ordering and payments meant he could cut down on wages for waiters. \u201cIn the future, we will only need one waiter to help in the restaurant and one to help with seating,\u201d Mr. Liu said.Before Venmo became the app for millennials to transfer money in the United States, both young and old in China were investing, reimbursing each other, paying bills,and buying products from stores with smartphone-based digital wallets.\u201cQuite frankly, the trope that China copies the U.S. hasn\u2019t been true for years, and in mobile it\u2019s the opposite: The U.S. often copies China,\u201d said Ben Thompson, the founder of the tech research firm Stratechery. \u201cFor the Facebook Messenger app, for example, the best way to understand their road map is to look at WeChat.\u201dA Facebook spokesman declined to comment. Tencent did not respond to requests for comment.Executives from companies like Facebook and smaller rivals like Kik are trying to replicate what has emerged in China: dominant online platforms where users will spend much of their time. Much of that effort is focused on chat.\u201cThe cool thing about chat is it becomes an operating system for your daily life,\u201d Mr. Livingston said. \u201cGoing up to a vending machine, ordering food, getting a cab: Chat can power those interactions, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing with WeChat.\u201dThe biggest advantage for China\u2019s tech industry, according to many analysts, is that it was able to fill a vacuum after the country essentially created much of its economy from scratch following the end of the Cultural Revolution, in 1976. Unlike in the United States, where banks and retailers already have strong holds on customers, China\u2019s state-run lenders are inefficient, and retailers never expanded broadly enough to serve a fast-growing middle class.Many Chinese also never bought a personal computer, meaning smartphones are the primary \u2014 and often first \u2014 computing device for the more than 600 million who have them in China.\u201cThe U.S. was first to credit cards, and everyone there has a personal computer. But China, where everyone is on their phones all the time, is now ahead in mobile commerce and mobile payments by virtue of leapfrogging the PC and credit cards,\u201d Mr. Thompson said.Chinese companies also approach the internet in a different way. In the United States, tech firms emphasize simplicity in their apps. But in China, its three major internet companies \u2014 Alibaba, Baidu and the WeChat parent Tencent \u2014 compete to create a single app with as many functions as they can stuff into it.On Alibaba\u2019s Taobao shopping app, people can also buy groceries, buy credits for online games, scan coupons and find deals at stores nearby. Baidu\u2019s mapping app lets users order an Uber, reserve a restaurant or hotel, order in food, buy movie tickets and find just about any type of store nearby.Tencent has opened up WeChat to other companies, allowing them to create apps within WeChat. Ebaoyang \u2014 a start-up that enables people to order oil changes for their cars directly on smartphones \u2014 was at first almost totally reliant on WeChat to attract business. Gao Feng, one of Ebaoyang\u2019s founders, said the company still relied on the app for 50 percent of its payments and 20 percent of new customers.\u201cWe started from WeChat. So it was our main, original source for getting customers,\u201d he said.Between fees for its services and money it makes through online games, WeChat manages to generate $7 in revenue per user each year, according to Nomura. The app has roughly 700 million users, more than the total number of smartphone users in China, in part because some users are outside the country and in part because people have multiple accounts.Much of that comes not from ads, as it might in the United States, but from spending on games, services and goods sold on the app. Those models may not translate from one market to the other, but the two can still borrow from each other, said Carmen Chang, a partner at the venture capital firm New Enterprise Associates.\u201cChina was able to develop a lot of innovative business models, which arose in a different kind of economy,\u201d said Ms. Chang, who spends time in both China and in Menlo Park, Calif. \u201cWhether or not we admit it here in Silicon Valley, it\u2019s had an impact on us and our thinking.\u201dCao Li in Beijing contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Cuban-American Generation Gap", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "Supported byLast Christmas, Michael and Gisel Davila, a Cuban-American couple who live in Queens, N.Y., were talking to her mother, Maria C. Castillo, while visiting her in Miami. It was a casual conversation, full of small talk about the holidays and work and the weather, until Ms. Davila, 30, mentioned that she and her husband were thinking about booking a trip over a long weekend to Cuba.\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d her mother said immediately. \u201cYou can\u2019t go.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t good,\u201d said Mr. Davila, 33. \u201cI seriously believe if I went to Cuba with my wife, my mother-in-law would never forgive us.\u201dFor most Cuban-Americans born here, the island of Cuba has existed as only a mythological ideal: a place whose culture, language and food could be recreated in exile but whose physical land could only be experienced through stories passed down from immigrant parents and grandparents.But now, thanks to the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba, the island is within easy reach and has emerged as a trendy destination, with companies like Google and Chanel holding high-profile events on the streets of Havana.While immigrant families have been legally allowed to visit Cuba since 2009, they are now thinking much harder about it since the subject is constantly in the news and their non-Cuban friends and colleagues are increasingly going.But within immigrant families, the question of whether to visit Cuba is not a simple one, and in some cases, it is creating dissension between members of different generations.Parents and grandparents who lived through the Communist revolution led by Fidel Castro are gripped by angst in considering their loved ones stepping foot on Cuban soil still ruled by Mr. Castro and his brother Ra\u00fal. Members of younger generations who were born in America long to see for themselves a country that has loomed so large in the back stories that shape their identities.\u201cImagine growing up hearing about it, and never being able to get there,\u201d Ms. Davila said. \u201cIt\u2019s like this fruit that is dangled in front of your face, but you can\u2019t actually touch it.\u201dShe and her husband are eager to go, and it irks Mr. Davila that so many travelers without an ethnic connection to Cuba have experienced his family\u2019s country before he has.But they also take seriously Ms. Castillo\u2019s opposition. Like many who escaped the rule of Fidel Castro in the 1960s and 1970s by leaving all their possessions behind, she recoils at the idea of her loved ones lending legitimacy and financial support to a country still under Mr. Castro\u2019s administration.\u201cI don\u2019t see why she has to go,\u201d Ms. Castillo said of her daughter. \u201cNothing has changed. The money doesn\u2019t go to the people. It all goes back to the regime.\u201d She feels so much anger toward Mr. Castro, she said, that she refuses to utter his name.On Mr. Davila\u2019s side, his aunts, uncles and cousins are opposed to relatives visiting the island. At a recent family dinner of roasted pig, fried plantains, rice and beans, some people were referring to Mr. Davila\u2019s brother George, a 37-year-old litigation lawyer in Miami, as \u201ca Communist\u201d for having visited Cuba three times. \u201cThere was like food being thrown,\u201d Mr. Davila said.\u201cWhen they first found out I was going, my father\u2019s sisters were like: \u2018Why are you going? You are going to get yourself arrested. You are going to contribute dollars to the government. You are going to get Communist-brainwashed,\u2019\u201d George said.George and Michael\u2019s mother, Maria Davila, was shamed by friends and relatives for allowing George\u2019s travel. \u201cThey told me and my husband that we were crazy Communists,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018No, we want them to experience what we had there and see another side of the world.\u2019\u201dMaria\u2019s encouragement of her sons\u2019 travels puts her in a minority of permissive parents. But not all adult children are heeding their parents\u2019 admonitions.Miranda Hernandez, a 20-year-old college student at the University of California, Berkeley, said that she was always nervous about how her family would react if she even considered a visit to Cuba. \u201cWhen they did speak about Cuba, they made it sound like North Korea with nice beaches,\u201d she said. \u201cI was raised being told I had no business there.\u201dMs. Hernandez went on CubaOne\u2019s inaugural trip this June. She saw the apartment in the Luyan\u00f3 neighborhood of Havana where her mother grew up and the hospital where she was born.She also met her great-uncle, second cousin and twin 16-year-old third cousins who, she was surprised to know, listen to the same music as American teenagers (Kanye West, Chance the Rapper and Chris Brown).Ms. Hernandez shared with her Cuban family stories and photographs of her Cuban-American family. \u201cWhen I met them, it was as if I knew them my entire life,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was surreal.\u201dWhen Ms. Hernandez first told her parents she would be going on the trip, the conversation turned to yelling. \u201cWhy would you want to go there?\u201d she said her parents said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to show you the nice tourist parts.\u201dAfter the trip, they were calmer and looked at the videos and photographs she took. \u201cThey were glad that some things have changed, and that I saw the real Cuba instead of just lying on a beach to sip mojitos like most tourists,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cOn the other hand, they were upset about the island\u2019s physical decay.\u201dSteven Andrew Garcia, a photographer and video director in Los Angeles, went on the CubaOne trip, too. His father was not thrilled. Like many Cuban exiles, Mr. Garcia\u2019s father is deeply distrustful of the Cuban government and feared for his son\u2019s safety.\u201cMy dad questioned who would be financing and coordinating this trip,\u201d said Mr. Garcia, 29. When he made it clear to his father that he had made his decision and intended to go, his father urged him to be careful, telling him, \u201cJust stay with the group and don\u2019t get lost.\u201dVanessa Garcia, now a 37-year-old writer (who is not related to Mr. Garcia), learned the hard way that her mother would take issue with her traveling to Cuba. Back in 2009, taking advantage of the new law that permitted Cuban-Americans with relatives living in Cuba to visit the island, Ms. Garcia bought a plane ticket to Havana with her sister, and then told her mother, Jackie Diaz-Sampol, about the trip they were going to take in a few weeks.\u201cShe got so, so, so red and had a vein popping out of her head,\u201d Ms. Garcia said of her mother, \u201cand she said: \u2018I am going to have a heart attack. You are going to kill your mother.\u2019 I tore my tickets, even though we paid $500 for each of them and they were nonrefundable, and threw them down the toilet. I couldn\u2019t do that to my mom.\u201dMs. Diaz-Sampol, now 60, said she fretted over the prospect of her daughter going because she worried about her physical safety. \u201cShe was na\u00efve, in my opinion, thinking you could go to Cuba like any other country,\u201d she said.They reached a d\u00e9tente of sorts in 2014, when the mother and daughter traveled back to Cuba together. (And when Ms. Garcia decided to travel to Cuba last May, she hatched a plan to avoid maternal interference: She waited until the night before she left to tell her mother and stepfather of her plans.)Not all younger Cuban-Americans are eager to visit. For Michelle Marie Arean, a 35-year-old associate editor at Recommend, a travel trade publication based in Miami, the stories she grew up hearing, about government raids of the family home and how her grandfather was exiled to a sugar cane farm where he was abused, were enough to turn her off. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to give money and support to a government that took so much away from my family,\u201d she said. She said she would go if the leader is ousted.It\u2019s a stance that baffles her non-Cuban friends and colleagues, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s opened my eyes to how many people who are not of Cuban descent simply do not understand what our families went through,\u201d she said.Many of those who are opposed to visiting Cuba say they would change their minds if there were a new, non-Communist government. But Aliza Wechsler, 31, has a different condition: She will travel there only if her mother, who left Cuba when she was 7, goes, too.\u201cI would regret it for the rest of my life if I didn\u2019t go with her and see it through her eyes,\u201d said Ms. Wechsler, who lives in New York. At least a few times a month, she said, she calls or emails her mother to ask her if they can start to plan a trip.Ms. Wechsler\u2019s mother, Lily Wechsler, a 63-year-old banker in Miami, said she would like to visit Cuba with her daughter, in a few years when prices become more reasonable.But just as Aliza wishes to travel there with her, Lily wishes to return to Cuba with her oldest sister, who escaped Cuba when she was 20, immediately after her honeymoon. But her sister, Lily said, refuses to go back.\u201cWe do disagree,\u201d she said. \u201cI do try to convince her. Ideally I would want to go with her because just like Aliza is waiting to go with me so I can make the experience meaningful, for me, I would have loved to go with her because she would have given it a lot more meaning.\u201dShe added, \u201cBut that\u2019s not going to happen unless both Castros die tomorrow and communism stops.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Too Poor to Afford the Internet", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorAll summer, kids have been hanging out in front of the Morris Park Library in the Bronx, before opening hours and after closing. They bring their computers to pick up the Wi-Fi signal that is leaking out of the building, because they can\u2019t afford internet access at home. They\u2019re there during the school year, too, even during the winter \u2014 it\u2019s the only way they can complete their online math homework.Last year, the Federal Communications Commission reaffirmed what these students already knew: Access to broadband is necessary to be a productive member of society. In June, a federal appeals court upheld the commission\u2019s authority to regulate the internet as a public utility.The court\u2019s decision is a partial victory. While the ruling ensures that the information superhighway can be maintained for the public interest, it doesn\u2019t help anyone who simply can\u2019t afford to have access to it. As many as one in five Americans remains in the digital dark. To start to tackle that problem, the F.C.C. has recently expanded its Lifeline program to provide subsidies for broadband access..Here in the world\u2019s information capital, New Yorkers are still scrounging for a few bars of web access, dropped like crumbs from a table. With broadband costing on average $55 per month, 25 percent of all households and 50 percent of those making less than $20,000 lack this service at home.People line up, sometimes for hours, to use the library system\u2019s free computers. Go into any library in the nation and you\u2019ll most likely see the same thing. They come to do what so many of us take for granted: apply for government services, study or do research, talk with family or friends, inform themselves as voters, and just participate in our society and culture \u2014 so much of which now takes place online.Our public libraries are charged with providing free access to information, and in recent years we have had to create new ways of doing that. Leaking broadband (frankly, accidentally) onto the branch stoops is not enough.In 2014, working with Mayor Bill de Blasio, and with support from Google and the Knight, Open Society and Robin Hood Foundations, we were able to let our patrons \u201ccheck out\u201d the internet. In all five boroughs \u2014 and also in Maine and Kansas, to see how it might work in more rural settings \u2014 libraries are lending a total of 10,000 cellphone-size Wi-Fi hot-spot devices for up to a year in neighborhoods that are digital deserts. With this access at home, young children and teenagers in our after-school programs and immigrants in our rapidly expanding English classes continue to learn and connect after they exit the library\u2019s doors.Yet we need help from more than libraries. No child can have equal access to education, nor any worker equal access to a job, without access to the internet and the digital training to use it skillfully. Our federal, state and local policies must recognize there can be no full equality without digital equality. We can also require the companies that reach millions of customers via city infrastructure to provide more affordable rates for low-income residents, and to ensure that broadband connections are provided to poor neighborhoods.Another, bolder approach, would be to create Wi-Fi for large geographic areas. Dozens of municipalities, including Philadelphia, Hartford and Minneapolis, have tried to offer Wi-Fi in their entire cities, with mixed success. Under Mayor de Blasio, New York City recently began an innovative program that refashions old public pay phones into Wi-Fi hot spots. Libraries and schools could add to this growing network of free broadband. Perhaps we should project Wi-Fi from every public building, with boosters to create a minimal level of home access as a public utility for all \u2014 and those who can afford a premium service may pay for one.I know there are technological hurdles to providing universal broadband. But the commitment I\u2019m asking for isn\u2019t particularly novel. Early in the last century, the nation\u2019s leaders decided, at no small cost, to bring clean water, then electricity, then phone service to all parts of our country. And from this foundation we built the wealthiest, most productive economy in the world.When New York City was founded by the Dutch, it had two great strengths: a population of varied backgrounds and ideas, and access to information, through its vibrant shipping industry. This is what made us a global city. Today\u2019s technology revolution promises to provide more information, more widely than ever. Yet we have left almost two million New Yorkers in the digital dark.We can fix this. We can realize our city\u2019s full potential in the digital age. And the kids in the Bronx can get their math homework done.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Once Taunted by Steve Jobs, Companies Are Now Big Customers of Apple", "Date": "2016-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThese days, the same could be said about Apple. Even IBM is promoting Apple gear.Apple\u2019s iPhones and iPads have become the preferred mobile computing devices for corporations, as industries from insurers to airlines aim to ditch bulky PCs and give their employees the ability to do their jobs from anywhere using smartphones or tablets.\u201cApple is stronger in the enterprise market with its devices than it is with consumers,\u201d said Frank Gillett, an industry analyst at Forrester.Pinpointing exact figures for Apple\u2019s corporate sales is difficult. Apple said growth was strong but declined to disclose recent numbers. During its last fiscal year, which ended in September, Apple said it sold $25 billion in gear and services to companies and other large customers. While that was only about 11 percent of the company\u2019s overall revenue, those business sales were up 40 percent from the previous year. That\u2019s compared with 28 percent growth for the entire business.Companies are turning to Apple\u2019s products for their tight-knit hardware and software, advanced security features and intuitive interfaces. Aiding Apple\u2019s corporate sales has been a concern that phones and tablets running Google\u2019s Android software, which are generally cheaper and popular with consumers, have lagged in the security technology and the standardization that companies want.For British Airways, which has built more than 40 custom iPad apps for its work force, switching to tablets has eliminated reams of paper used for flight plans, passenger manifests and maintenance records. Another app allows anyone at the airline to grab an iPad and quickly rebook passengers when a flight is canceled or weather wreaks havoc on schedules.\u201cWe can get to customers wherever they are,\u201d said Abigail Comber, who is in charge of the customer experience at the airline. \u201cIt\u2019s technology that\u2019s very intuitive. What the team has managed to do brilliantly is take away everything that happens on the back end.\u201d The carrier has so far deployed its apps across 17,000 iPads, and is looking to digitize even more of its business.Apple says it is focused on creating great devices \u2014 for all customers. \u201cWe\u2019re dedicated to building products that make people\u2019s lives better, often in ways that we couldn\u2019t have even imagined, enabling them to do things that they have never done before,\u201d Susan Prescott, vice president of worldwide product marketing, markets and applications, said in a statement. \u201cOur goal with business customers is the same \u2014 to enable them to do something great with mobile and truly modernize and transform their business.\u201dApple\u2019s increased attention to business customers has not come without internal angst.\u201cApple totally recognizes that their products are being used in a workplace context and not just at home,\u201d Mr. Gillett said. \u201cBut they are rabidly focused on making the world better for individual users. They have a strong fear if they begin to think too much about their enterprise customers, they will compromise the consumer experience.\u201dApple runs three-day boot camps for companies at its campus in Cupertino, Calif., to help them rapidly build prototype apps. But it was not an approach that could be scaled up to thousands of corporate customers.Hence Apple\u2019s decision to team up with other companies that specialize in catering to businesses. As Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, quipped at an industry conference last September: \u201cLife is short. We\u2019re going to die soon. And you\u2019ve got to have as many friends as you can.\u201dMahmoud Naghshineh, IBM\u2019s general manager for the Apple partnership, says Apple\u2019s devices appeal to companies that need to manage complex processes. IBM\u2019s strategy is to develop apps for specific industries, then customize them for each customer.Claims adjusters at Amica Mutual Insurance, for example, recently began using an IBM iPad app to collect information on claims, take photos, record statements and gain access to individual customer files. \u201cThe adjuster in the future will be able to complete their entire job on the iPad,\u201d said Adam Kostecki, an Amica manager involved in the project.Many companies are forging ahead on their own. Lowe\u2019s, the home improvement retailer, has built five iPod apps. One allows store employees to pull up reviews with 360-degree views of products, check inventory and guide customers to the exact location of a product within its warehouse-size outlets.Other apps allow employees to match a carpet pattern and estimate how much a customer would need to cover a given area. Inspired by the iPhone-based checkout system at Apple stores, Lowe\u2019s has even written a checkout app that it is testing in its two Manhattan stores.\u201cIf you think about devices that a lot of retailers provide to their associates, they aren\u2019t user-friendly. They are sometimes very old technology,\u201d said Eric Hanson, the director of digital experience at Lowe\u2019s. \u201cOur associates were deserving of an experience that was the same as we gave to our customers.\u201dVan Baker, an analyst at the Gartner research firm who studies mobile technology in businesses, said that most companies are just beginning to explore how mobile devices can transform their businesses. \u201cFor the vast majority of enterprises, mobile usage extends to email, contacts and calendars,\u201d he said.That opens up opportunities that Apple is cautiously pursuing.\u201cCook has taken a pragmatic approach without changing Apple\u2019s culture,\u201d Mr. Gillett, the Forrester analyst, said.

It also says that cellphone makers are free to use Android-based services provided by rivals. Google does not make money directly from licensing the mobile operating system to companies, but it takes a cut from advertisements displayed on online searches.The Indian officials suggested that the company was abusing its dominant market position by ranking its services ahead of those of competitors in Google search, according to people with knowledge of the report, which has not been made public.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Edward Snowden\u2019s Long, Strange Journey to Hollywood", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "FeatureOliver Stone wanted a hit \u2014 and the chance to put America\u2019s most iconic dissident onscreen. The subject wanted veto power. The Russian lawyer wanted someone to option the novel he\u2019d written. The American lawyer just wanted the whole insane project to go away. Somehow a film got made.Supported by\u201cI think we should move,\u201d he said. His producer, Moritz Borman, led the way to another corner. \u201cHow\u2019s this?\u201d Borman asked.Stone didn\u2019t answer. He eyed an older couple slurping soup and kept moving. A moment later, Stone finally settled in by a window, comfortably beyond earshot of the other patrons.Such security precautions had become routine. Ever since Stone decided to make a biopic about Edward Snowden, the American whistle-\u00adblower currently holed up in Moscow somewhere, the director \u2014 who became a Buddhist while making \u201cHeaven & Earth\u201d and sampled a buffet of psychedelic drugs for \u201cThe Doors\u201d \u2014 had gone all method again. On \u201cSnowden,\u201d he and Borman became so preoccupied with American government surveillance that they had their Los Angeles offices swept for bugs more than once.The director hadn\u2019t been sleeping well. Principal photography wrapped a month earlier, and now Stone had come to Moscow to film Snowden for the movie\u2019s grand finale. He ordered a decaf coffee and began to lay out the events that led him and Borman to be hanging out in Russian hotels, on the lookout for potential spies. \u201cLast January, Moritz calls me,\u201d Stone said. \u201cHe says: \u2018You got a call from this fella who represents Mr. Snowden. You\u2019re invited to Moscow.\u2019\u2009\u201dThe call had come from Anatoly Kucherena, Snowden\u2019s Russian lawyer. In the course of his career, Kucherena has represented Russian oligarchs, film directors, a few pop singers and a state minister. In 2012, he campaigned for Vladimir V. Putin, and soon after Snowden landed in Moscow, Kucherena showed up at Sheremetyevo Airport and offered his services. Then Kucherena wrote a novel about his new client. Titled \u201cTime of the Octopus,\u201d it follows a National Security Agency leaker named Joshua Cold who is marooned in the airport and the Russian advocate who liberates him. In January 2014, months before the book was published, Kucherena called Borman to see if Stone might like to make it into a Hollywood movie.\u201cAnd I know you from working on, what, three films?\u201d Stone said at the bar.\u201cFive,\u201d Borman said.At the time, Stone and Borman were barely speaking after a falling-\u00adout during the making of \u201cSavages,\u201d a beachy Blake Lively thriller. \u201cWe\u2019ve had our fights,\u201d Stone said. \u201cYou know, he\u2019s German; I\u2019m American.\u201d He didn\u2019t elaborate.\u201cHe calls, and I go: \u2018Oh, [expletive]. Not again,\u2019\u2009\u201d Stone continued. It wasn\u2019t just about Borman. Stone wanted nothing to do with another political docudrama. He spent two decades trying to get a biopic about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. off the ground, only to see \u201cSelma\u201d get made to critical acclaim. Then there was the My Lai massacre film. Merrill Lynch put up cash, Bruce Willis was set to star and Stone built an entire village in Thailand. As the economy collapsed in 2008, the financing evaporated. \u201cYou get these scars, and they don\u2019t go away,\u201d Stone said.So Stone was skeptical. But this was Snowden, who single-\u00adhandedly exposed the colossal scale on which the United States had been surveilling its citizens. Plus, the director needed a hit. After early successes like \u201cPlatoon\u201d and \u201cWall Street,\u201d his more recent films didn\u2019t receive the attention he hoped. The Snowden story had all the ingredients of an epic Stone picture: politics, government conspiracy and, at the center of it all, an American patriot who had lost faith. If it panned out, it could be Stone\u2019s millennial follow-\u00adup to \u201cBorn on the Fourth of July,\u201d the Ron Kovic biopic that won him an Oscar in 1990.But first Stone and Borman had to make sure Kucherena was for real. Borman asked the lawyer to send the book and two first-class tickets to Moscow. Both arrived the next day. In case they still had doubts, Kucherena\u2019s office gave Borman a number to call. On the other end was an employee of the Russian consulate in San Francisco, who turned out to be a big fan of \u201cThe Life of David Gale,\u201d a film Borman produced. They were issued visas that same week. (Kucherena denies buying first-class tickets for Stone and Borman or helping expedite their visas.)\u201cWhen that happened,\u201d Borman said, \u201cI thought, O.K., I guess Kucherena can pull the strings.\u201dThe initial revelations were sensational. Not only had the N.S.A. been monitoring the calls, emails and web activity of millions of Americans, but it also had been tapping into the networks of Google, Yahoo and other companies to do so. The Guardian published the leaks, and Greenwald eventually revealed the identity of his source in a video shot by Poitras. Depending on your feelings about national security, the N.S.A.\u2019s actions were either necessary or unconstitutional. The Apple co-\u00adfounder Steve Wozniak called Snowden a hero. Secretary of State John Kerry called him a traitor. Donald Trump called for his execution.As Snowden became a celebrity, a cause and a historical event, the web of people who wanted to take part in it widened. Most had his best interests in mind, but his story also happened to advance agendas that had long needed an appealing spokesperson. Civil-\u00adliberties lawyers wanted to represent him. Activist journalists wanted access to him. Publishers rushed out books, including \u201cThe Snowden Files: The Inside Story of the World\u2019s Most Wanted Man,\u201d by Luke Harding of The Guardian, and \u201cThe Snowden Operation: Inside the West\u2019s Greatest Intelligence Disaster,\u201d by Edward Lucas of The Economist. Despite promising an \u201cinside\u201d look, neither writer had ever met Snowden.Those with intimate knowledge documented the experience, too. In 2014, Greenwald published \u201cNo Place to Hide: Edward Snowden, the N.S.A. and the U.S. Surveillance State,\u201d a dramatic retelling of how Greenwald broke the story. That fall, Poitras released \u201cCitizenfour,\u201d a tense and spooky documentary about a modest and intelligent young man who hid under a blanket when typing on his laptop. (It won the 2015 Oscar for best documentary.)Snowden, meanwhile, ended up in Russia. He had embarked on a trip to Ecuador, but the United States revoked his passport midflight, leaving him stranded in Moscow. For Russia, Snowden was like a bird that flew in through an open window \u2014 or, as Putin joked, an unwanted Christmas present. But politically speaking, he could be useful. After enduring the United States\u2019 endless lectures about human rights, the Kremlin could suddenly welcome a man who exposed large-scale American hypocrisy.Kucherena entered the picture as Snowden\u2019s lifeline, or at least as someone who could help him navigate Russia\u2019s asylum laws. An experienced lawyer, Kucherena was appointed by Putin to the Public Council, overseeing the Federal Security Service (F.S.B.). Snowden\u2019s case presented a new opportunity. It took Kucherena a month to negotiate Snowden\u2019s stay and three months to write \u201cTime of the Octopus.\u201dStone\u2019s first meeting with Kucherena was a disaster. (\u201cI thought he was a gruff bear,\u201d Stone told me.) The director wanted to meet Snowden, but Kucherena said Snowden wouldn\u2019t meet them until they agreed to option \u201cTime of the Octopus.\u201d (Kucherena denies this.) According to Stone and Borman, by the end of a long weekend, they reached a gentlemen\u2019s agreement: Stone would option the novel \u2014 if Kucherena could provide regular access to his client.During those 24 hours, this magazine had contacted Ben Wizner, Snowden\u2019s lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union, to arrange an interview with his client. Kucherena may be Snowden\u2019s Russian representative, but in the United States, Wizner runs the show. Wizner was furious. Not just because Stone had invited a reporter to Moscow, but because of how it all looked: that Snowden was involved in a Hollywood movie and that the whole production was seemingly brokered by a lawyer with ties to the Kremlin. Borman would later tell me that we had waded into the sticky territory of Snowden\u2019s multiple emissaries. \u201cThere are two ways to access him: One is Kucherena and one is Wizner, and it\u2019s completely political,\u201d Borman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a political situation that goes way above your head.\u201dWhen Wizner and I finally got on the phone, he was in damage-\u00adcontrol mode. He told me that Snowden wasn\u2019t profiting from Stone\u2019s film in any way. \u201cOne hard-and-fast rule Ed always had was, I\u2019m not selling my life rights,\u201d Wizner said. Snowden\u2019s participation in a Hollywood movie would only fuel the claims of his critics \u2014 that he was a narcissist eager to cash in. That said, Stone\u2019s film would be seen by millions of people, which meant it could sway public opinion. \u201cWe were choosing between two bad options,\u201d Wizner said. \u201cHe could have stubbornly stayed completely at arm\u2019s length and had no input whatsoever. Or he could have some input and compromised the arm\u2019s-length relationship. And I didn\u2019t know how to advise him on that.\u201dAccording to Wizner, Snowden met with Stone only to make sure that the film told an accurate story. \u201cIt\u2019s been us walking this tightrope between clearly not having any formal connection to the project \u2014 not deriving any benefit from it \u2014 and also not wanting to just be completely helpless and, you know, see what Oliver Stone comes up with,\u201d Wizner said. Despite some initial discomfort, he was tentatively optimistic. \u201cMaybe it\u2019ll be good,\u201d Wizner added. \u201cYou know, Oliver Stone wrote \u2018Scarface.\u2019\u2009\u201dStill, Stone was heading to Moscow to film Snowden for an appearance in the movie, which could be seen as an endorsement. Fact-\u00adchecking is one thing, I said; a cameo is another. \u201cIt is, and I\u2019m not entirely comfortable with it,\u201d Wizner said.Wizner had negotiated veto control over any footage featuring Snowden in the film. After we spoke, the lawyer says he asked Borman to put that in writing. He also reiterated that if Stone took a reporter along, Snowden would not participate. Stone and I eventually reached a compromise: I wouldn\u2019t observe the shoot, but I could still come and meet Kucherena.A few days later, I met Stone in Moscow. The director, who is 69, has a forward-\u00adleaning gait and unruly eyebrows, so that he looks a bit like a bull that is always about to charge. He emerged from the hotel\u2019s elevator with a pained look on his face. It was drizzling, and Stone\u2019s hair, which is the color of dark shoe polish, was pointing laterally. \u201cI have some bad news,\u201d he said. \u201cI cannot deliver Anatoly.\u201d He had just seen Snowden, who had been in touch with Wizner and was very upset, Stone said. \u201cEd said he doesn\u2019t want Anatoly talking to you, and he said that very clearly,\u201d Stone added.I would spend the next few days camped out at the hotel. When Stone wasn\u2019t shooting, we would meet in the lobby bar as he continued to tell me about the making of his film.Soon after optioning Kucherena\u2019s novel, Stone had returned to Moscow with his co-\u00adwriter, Kieran Fitzgerald, a recent University of Texas M.F.A. graduate. Anticipating a homesick Snowden, Fitzgerald hauled over a duffel bag packed with the stuff of Americana dreams: Kraft macaroni and cheese, \u00adJell-O cups, Oreos, Pepperidge Farm cookies, Twizzlers, peanut butter, Spam, an Orioles baseball cap and a pair of Converse sneakers. \u201cIt was like delivering a care package to a kid at summer camp,\u201d Fitzgerald told me. He also slipped in a copy of \u201cThe Odyssey\u201d translated by his grandfather, Robert Fitzgerald. \u201cI thought it was appropriate, since Ed was on his own kind of odyssey trying to get home.\u201dSnowden and Stone had gotten off to a slow start. Snowden was squeamish about a movie being made about his life. Stone, in turn, said the film would be made with or without him. Fitzgerald says he played referee. \u201cOliver can be a bit of battering ram,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cHe\u2019s accustomed to hard men who need to be cracked, but that\u2019s not Edward Snowden. He\u2019s not an alpha-\u00admale type. He\u2019s a very sensitive mind. So I was there to say: \u2018Everything is going to be O.K. He\u2019s a good guy. It\u2019s going to be a good movie.\u2019\u2009\u201d Eventually, Snowden began to open up, answering questions about his childhood; his girlfriend, Lindsay Mills; and what he could about his work for the N.S.A.While Fitzgerald returned to Austin to work on the script, Stone set out to plant his flag in the Snowden story. In Hollywood, book options are the equivalent of calling dibs, and Stone had competition. In May 2014, Sony Pictures optioned Greenwald\u2019s \u201cNo Place to Hide.\u201d By June, Stone had announced that he acquired Kucherena\u2019s book and Harding\u2019s \u201cThe Snowden Files.\u201d The tactic worked. Sony got nervous. \u201cNow what?\u201d Amy Pascal, then Sony\u2019s co-\u00adchairwoman, wrote to another executive. (The email would be leaked during the Sony hack.) Pascal\u2019s colleague reminded her of the case of the dual Steve Jobs biopics \u2014 \u201cJobs,\u201d with Ashton Kutcher, might have come out first, but it was \u201cSteve Jobs,\u201d starring Michael Fassbender, that was the better film. Pascal wasn\u2019t convinced. \u201cOliver Stone is not Ashton Kutcher,\u201d she responded. She wrote to George Clooney to pique his interest in adapting Greenwald\u2019s book, but Clooney passed. \u201cStone will do a hatchet job on the movie, but it will still be the film of Snowden,\u201d he replied.For Stone, the impending Sony project was a call to arms. Fitzgerald cranked out a first draft of the script, and that fall Stone went out to studios with a budget of $50 million and a release date in December 2015. Each one turned it down, and Stone became convinced that the studios wanted to quash the project because of its controversial subject matter. \u201cThis is why corporations owning movie studios is not a good idea,\u201d he said.While Borman hustled to find independent financing, Stone dove into casting. For the lead, he chose Joseph Gordon-\u00adLevitt, the son of liberals from Sherman Oaks, Calif., and a former child actor who has retained a pleasingly boyish look. \u201cThere\u2019s an interesting blandness to him in the same way that Jimmy Stewart might\u2019ve been considered bland,\u201d Stone said. \u201cThere\u2019s a neutrality there, which allows him to grow on you.\u201d Shailene Woodley was cast to play Lindsay Mills, Zachary Quinto as Greenwald and Melissa Leo as Poitras.By early 2015, Borman and Stone had racked up several hundred thousand dollars in debt, but the money was still short. The shoot was ultimately delayed three weeks as the producer cobbled together European partners. In the United States, \u201cSnowden\u201d was picked up by Open Road Films, a small production company that had just put out \u201cJobs\u201d \u2014 the Kutcher version.\u201cIt was painful that we ended up with this independent distributor,\u201d Stone said.Borman offered that Open Road was not so independent anymore.\u201cI\u2019d never heard of it,\u201d Stone said, adding: \u201cI\u2019ve been there before, but not on this level and not at this age. So for me, it was very difficult personally.\u201dI had gotten my copy from Stone, who handed it to me with a disclaimer. \u201cNow, it\u2019s easy to take a shot at this,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, it wasn\u2019t the basis of the movie. But it\u2019s fun. I enjoyed reading it.\u201d\u201cTime of the Octopus\u201d takes place in a single night. The protagonist, Joshua Cold, is sequestered in a bunker at Sheremetyevo Airport, where his Russian lawyer keeps him company. The chapters alternate between their time-\u00adstamped conversations and those labeled as digital files (\u201cFile 004.wav\u201d), suggesting that they are the lawyer\u2019s transcribed recordings. The basic facts of Cold\u2019s case sound familiar, as do the character names: There are journalists named Boitras and Greywold and an organization called Mikileaks run by an Augusto Cassangie. For the most part, Cold and the lawyer sit and talk about life, quoting Laozi to each other. But there is also a distinctly post-\u00adSoviet tone to the novel, which reads both like a love letter to American culture \u2014 Steven Spielberg, B.B. King, \u201cThe Terminator,\u201d Penthouse magazine, Popeye, \u201cThe \u00adX-Files,\u201d Paul Newman, Bon Jovi, \u201cSpider-\u00adMan,\u201d \u201cBraveheart,\u201d Quentin Tarantino and Tupac Shakur are all mentioned \u2014 and a gleeful taunt to its government. \u201cNot only did [Cold] snap the beak of the American eagle,\u201d Kucherena writes, \u201cbut he also gave him a good kick and a very humiliating one, as if it was not a menacing predator but a rural hen.\u201dIn the bunker, Cold enjoys pizza and whiskey, but he is worried about American agents coming to retrieve him. \u201cBelieve me, Russia is not the worst option for you,\u201d the lawyer tells Cold. \u201cAnd you needn\u2019t regard us with such mistrust.\u201dOnce Cold is granted asylum, the propaganda is dialed up. \u201cI shall work in Russia and get an apartment!\u201d Cold announces. \u201cI thought I would spend the rest of my life in this underground prison.\u201d\u201cAs far as I know Mr. Putin, he is not one to change his mind easily,\u201d the lawyer assures him. \u201cAll will be O.K.\u201d The novel concludes with Cold vowing to learn to drink like the Russians, but the lawyer suggests he try Kvass instead, a fermented beverage made from rye bread. (\u201cIt is the Russian Coca-\u00adCola,\u201d the lawyer says.) Then they leave the bunker.\u201cWeird, huh?\u201d Fitzgerald said when I asked about the novel. In fact, few people associated with either Snowden or \u201cSnowden\u201d wanted to discuss it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say anything on the record about that book,\u201d Gordon-\u00adLevitt told me.According to WikiLeaks, Stone paid a million dollars for \u201cTime of the Octopus,\u201d which seemed like a hefty amount to pay for material that Stone admitted he had no plans of using. (That\u2019s the same figure Sony reportedly paid for the rights to \u201cEat, Pray, Love.\u201d) \u201cWe bought it because we did get good access to Ed,\u201d Stone explained. \u201cHe had to be brought along.\u201dDuring Stone\u2019s visits, Kucherena hosted the director at his favorite restaurants and at his dacha outside Moscow. \u201cThey had a kind of bromance,\u201d Fitzgerald told me. Photos from the trips look like vacation postcards, with Stone and Fitzgerald grinning in Red Army caps (a gift from Kucherena) and Fitzgerald and Gordon-\u00adLevitt posing for a selfie in front of St. Basil\u2019s Cathedral. While out in public, the group referred to Snowden as \u201cSasha,\u201d a nickname Kucherena had given him.Kucherena and I would eventually speak by phone. He said he wrote the novel because he had received calls from many \u201crepresentatives of Hollywood,\u201d writers and filmmakers. \u201cAt some point, I just thought to myself, Why don\u2019t I try to write the book?\u201d he said. I asked which writers and directors had called him. \u201cVery many people called me,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut I honestly don\u2019t remember their names now.\u201dThe lawyer was deeply troubled by the news media\u2019s insinuations that he is connected to the Kremlin. He pointed to several clients he has defended against the F.S.B., including Platon Obukhov, a writer accused of spying for Britain. \u201cI never had any kind of agreement with the Kremlin,\u201d he said. \u201cThey tried to say I\u2019m tied to the F.S.B., but that\u2019s complete nonsense, excuse me.\u201dKucherena said he was inspired by his favorite authors, who include Tom Clancy, Aldous Huxley and George Orwell. \u201cThe Octopus in my novel is, you can say, a direct offspring of Big Brother,\u201d he said. Like most writers of fiction, he was reluctant to discuss which parts of his book were based in reality. \u201cA person can only be open with someone he trusts,\u201d Kucherena said. \u201cAnd here, because he had no one else, it turned out that I took on the role of mother and father. Accordingly, we had confidential conversations of various sorts.\u201dHe did not see a conflict of interest in his writing the novel. \u201cI wrote an artistic book,\u201d Kucherena said. Because he represents Snowden pro bono, he never expected to capitalize on the relationship. \u201cI don\u2019t take any money from him,\u201d Kucherena said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any. So I wrote a book, yes, fine. So I got a little, as we say in Russian.\u201dDespite being the one to put the \u201cSnowden\u201d project into motion, Kucherena shied away from assuming any credit. \u201cI\u2019m very far from all that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just an advocate. Look at where I am and where Hollywood is!\u201dWizner, who is 45, has been at the A.C.L.U. since 2001. Before Snowden, he tried to bring several suits to increase oversight over the intelligence community. Wizner likes to say that he spent a decade banging his head against a wall, and then Snowden came along and brought that wall down. Snowden had not only revealed the scope of the surveillance apparatus, but also that top government officials routinely misled the public about it. Since becoming Snowden\u2019s advocate, Wizner has become a figure of not insignificant geopolitical importance. Those revelations have since formed a critical backdrop for legislative reforms, and there are few things that irritate Wizner more than claims that threaten to tarnish Snowden\u2019s character and their common cause.It would not be a stretch to say that for Wizner, Kucherena has become a bit of a liability. Since 2013, the Russian lawyer has announced that Snowden landed a job at a major Russian website \u2014 news that turned out to not be true \u2014 and has supplied the news media with photos of his client enjoying his new life in Russia, attending an opera at the Bolshoi Theater and cheerfully hugging a dog named Rick. (Rick later turned out to be the dog of one of Kucherena\u2019s friends.) Now Kucherena had sold a novel to Stone, making it seem as if the director had to pay a Russian fixer to have access to Snowden \u2014 or worse, that Snowden was somehow under the lock and key of the Russian authorities, lent to Stone for a Hollywood movie.Wizner\u2019s counterefforts in the United States have been successful. Former Attorney General Eric Holder, once a fierce critic, has acknowledged that Snowden performed \u201ca public service.\u201d President Obama has called for the reform of phone metadata collection, and last June, Congress passed the U.S.A. Freedom Act, a law that directly resulted from Snowden\u2019s leaks. Snowden has come to be seen as a levelheaded activist. According to Wizner, he leads a free existence in Russia, making appearances via live video and publishing op-eds against Russia\u2019s human rights violations. \u201cI think people are inclined to believe that Russia would never let him stay there unless he was paying for it in some way,\u201d Wizner said. \u201cBut it\u2019s just not true. Not only is he not cooperating, but he\u2019s actually being critical.\u201dWhen I asked Wizner about Kucherena\u2019s book, we were meeting at a cafe near his office in Lower Manhattan. \u201cMaybe you should just characterize my facial expression \u2014 \u2018He smirked,\u2019\u2009\u201d Wizner said. (Except that his smirk was mixed with a frown.)According to him, Snowden has not read Kucherena\u2019s book. \u201cThe thing is, Ed has much bigger fish to fry,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you had people calling for your assassination, you\u2019d be annoyed. If you were facing life in solitary confinement, you\u2019d be concerned. If someone wrote some book in Russia that no one is going to read, it doesn\u2019t register.\u201dWizner was reluctant to discuss Kucherena\u2019s role in Snowden\u2019s life, but he conceded that it was somewhat unorthodox. \u201cIt seems like the ethical rules governing the attorney-\u00adclient relationship may be somewhat different in Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be very unusual for a lawyer in a high-\u00adprofile case to provide exclusive photos of his client to newspapers or write an unauthorized book and sell it to Hollywood.\u201dKucherena and Wizner have never met. Whatever uneasiness there may be, Kucherena spoke warmly about his American counterpart. \u201cWe are on the same team!\u201d he told me. \u201cBen works in America, I work in Russia. If he wanted to write a book, I would have no problem.\u201d Wizner told me he has no plans to write a book about Snowden, fictional or otherwise.We had met in the lobby bar again, the day after he filmed Snowden, and the director was in better spirits. The shoot took place at Kucherena\u2019s dacha. The day went long. Stone\u2019s idea was to interview Snowden and capture an affecting moment that would give the film its dramatic ending. But the first takes were stiff. \u201cEd is used to answering questions on a level of intelligence,\u201d Stone said. \u201cBut I was interested in the emotional, which is difficult for him.\u201d Stone ended up doing nine takes. At one point, they took a break and went for a walk around Kucherena\u2019s property. By the end of the day, Stone decided that he had gotten Snowden to go as far as he was going to. \u201cHe was cooperative,\u201d Stone said. \u201cHe wanted to make it work. But as an actor \u2014 he\u2019s not used to that. I mean, he\u2019s not an actor. And I don\u2019t think he became one that day.\u201dTo make Snowden more comfortable, Stone worked with a minimal crew. Some were meeting the whistle-\u00adblower for the first time and still seemed a bit star-struck. \u201cSuddenly this little creature comes teetering in \u2014 so fragile, so lovely, such a charming, well-\u00adbehaved, beautiful little man,\u201d the cinematographer, Anthony Dod Mantle, told me. \u201cHe\u2019s like an old soul in a very young body. He\u2019s got fingers like violins.\u201d Filming Snowden reminded Mantle of shooting other men with outsize reputations and slight builds. \u201cIt\u2019s like Bono or Al Pacino,\u201d he added. \u201cThose guys are teeny-\u00adweenies. But if you isolate him into a frame, he can be as big as anybody else.\u201dMantle shot Danny Boyle\u2019s \u201cSlumdog Millionaire\u201d and \u201c127 Hours,\u201d but \u201cSnowden\u201d proved to be a special challenge. Convinced that making the film on American soil would be too risky, Stone decided to film in Germany, where Borman was able to score some tax subsidies. With roughly 140 script pages to shoot in 54 days, the crew sprinted from Munich to Washington, to Hawaii, to Hong Kong, and then back to Munich. Often, Mantle wouldn\u2019t get to see locations before he had to film in them. To cut costs, the suburbs of Munich had to stand in for rural Maryland and Virginia, with German extras cast as Americans. \u201cThank God the Germans act like Americans,\u201d Stone said.The production itself resembled a covert operation, with a code name (\u201cSasha\u201d had stuck) and elaborate security protocols. Worried that \u201cSasha\u201d would be of interest to the N.S.A., Borman and Stone avoided discussing production details by phone or email \u2014 \u201cIt was all handwritten notes and long walks in the park,\u201d Borman said \u2014 and kept the script on air-\u00adgapped computers, ones that have never been connected to the internet. If it had to be mailed, Borman would mix up the pages into four packages, which he would send with four different couriers to four different addresses. \u201cMaybe nobody gave a [expletive],\u201d Borman told me. \u201cOr maybe the N.S.A. is laughing at us like, \u2018Look at those idiots \u2014 of course we copied everything that came through DHL and FedEx!\u201dFor the actors, the frenetic schedule and paranoia on set added to the mood of the production. \u201cSnowden himself was in the midst of a stressful situation, so the fact that our shoot was a little bit that way, I think, helped,\u201d Gordon-\u00adLevitt said, before catching himself. \u201cMaking the movie was obviously a walk in the park compared to what he did. But just to have those little emotional touch points can help when you\u2019re acting.\u201dCommitted to inhabiting Snowden\u2019s robotic speech pattern, Gordon-\u00adLevitt lifted the audio from \u201cCitizenfour\u201d and played it on repeat while he slept. He also worried that some of the dialogue felt heavy-\u00adhanded. \u201cOliver is very into making his point,\u201d the actor said, \u201cas he should be. I really admire him for that. But I felt like it was my job to be like, \u2018O.K., I want to make the point, too, but this is a human being and not just a mouthpiece.\u201d Stone found Gordon-\u00adLevitt\u2019s approach too \u201cdocumentary-\u00adish\u201d at times. \u201cI was trying for the dramatic side as much as possible,\u201d Stone said. Fitzgerald was ultimately flown in to the set to execute last-\u00adminute rewrites.By late spring of 2015, Stone was close to wrapping when his mother, Jacqueline Goddet Stone, died at 93. She had called him in Munich, but Stone felt he couldn\u2019t risk leaving. \u201cTo go to L.A. would have cost us three down days,\u201d Stone told me. \u201cI knew she was going to pass, but I thought I could make it.\u201d Stone remained on set during the funeral and kept shooting.Stone\u2019s trip to Moscow to film the real Snowden was the last bit he needed to complete the film. But he was still worried \u2014 that the footage would be leaked, that critics would eviscerate it, that Snowden wouldn\u2019t like it. \u201cI want him to vet it,\u201d he said. He was heading to New York to begin editing and planned to return to Moscow at the end of the summer to show Snowden a rough cut. \u201cO.K., my dear,\u201d Stone said, getting up to leave. \u201cSee you in New York.\u201dThen he disappeared for six months.At the time, Stone wasn\u2019t interested, and Greenwald negotiated the deal with Sony. Stone later came back and offered to match Sony\u2019s bid, but Greenwald declined. \u201cI think he was a little perturbed,\u201d Greenwald said. Of the principal cast, Zachary Quinto, who plays Greenwald in Stone\u2019s movie, was the only actor who didn\u2019t meet his real-life counterpart as research. \u201cI always thought that was a little weird,\u201d Greenwald said. \u201cI think Oliver thought I had some competitive hostility toward his project, or he had some hostility \u2014 I\u2019m not really sure.\u201d (According to Stone, Quinto didn\u2019t need to meet Greenwald because there were so many videos of the journalist online.)In the spring of 2014, Stone flew to Berlin and met with Poitras. The meeting did not go well. According to Poitras, Stone proposed that she delay the release of \u201cCitizenfour,\u201d which she was then in the middle of editing, to time up with his film. \u201cBecause his film would be the real movie \u2014 because it\u2019s a Hollywood movie,\u201d Poitras told me. \u201cObviously I wasn\u2019t interested in doing that. To have another filmmaker ask me to delay the release of my film was \u2014 well, it was somewhat insulting.\u201dStone was annoyed, but he stuck around for a few drinks. They discussed new movies, including \u201c12 Years a Slave.\u201d As Poitras recalls, Stone found the film too violent, while Poitras thought the brutality was appropriate given the subject matter. Stone was growing increasingly frustrated. \u201cAt some point, he reached over and had his hands around my neck,\u201d Poitras said. \u201cIt was sort of in a joking way. I think he was a little bit drunk. But it was not a particularly pleasant evening.\u201dAccording to Stone, he only offered to help Poitras get distribution. \u201cWe thought we\u2019d help her either bring out her film with our film, or in the wake of it or before it, if we could,\u201d Stone said. He didn\u2019t recall pretending to strangle Poitras. \u201cI think from talking to her, you sense she\u2019s superparanoid,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I liked her,\u201d he continued. \u201cI admired her. I saw her films. I was trying to help her. If Laura is accusing me of trying to aggress her or kill her, she\u2019s crazy.\u201dStone\u2019s torment is at least in part self-\u00adinflicted. Biopics can be a nasty business, and Stone routinely throws himself into historical narratives and the messy negotiation between fact and fiction. The haggling with historians and family estates is the reason Stone was never able to make films about Martin Luther King Jr. and Hank Williams, and it was why he had to wait for Richard M. Nixon to die to make \u201cNixon.\u201d For Stone, the real-life characters of the stories he is after have become both the obstacles and the necessary arbiters of his work. It\u2019s why he refused to make \u201cSnowden\u201d without Snowden, and why his appeals to Greenwald and Poitras were his way of getting them on board.If Poitras had a strong reaction to Stone\u2019s proposal, it was because she had already been hounded by Sony. After the studio optioned Greenwald\u2019s book, Poitras says Sony asked to buy her life rights \u2014 an offer she declined. Sony suggested that she come on as a consultant, but when the contract arrived, it stipulated that the studio would have access to Poitras\u2019s tapes and notebooks. \u201cSo I\u2019d already gone through that when Oliver came in trying to position himself,\u201d she said.Poitras is a soft-\u00adspoken, cautious woman who has spent much of the past decade on government watch lists. Her resistance to participating in various Snowden projects has less to do with her feeling territorial than with her trying to maintain some control as she has become a character in a story that is no longer hers. Poitras\u2019s radical position is that the \u201cSnowden story\u201d can really belong only to Snowden. \u201cI could have asked him for a life-rights contract in Hong Kong, but I don\u2019t believe in that as a concept,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s his story, and I hope he tells it when he\u2019s ready.\u201dNeither Greenwald nor Poitras ultimately object to Stone making his film. While his own movie still lingered in development, Greenwald thought Snowden\u2019s story might in fact be safer in Stone\u2019s hands than it would be elsewhere. The Sony leaks would eventually reveal that Stone\u2019s paranoia may have been justified: In emails about the purchase of Greenwald\u2019s book, an executive in Sony\u2019s government-\u00adaffairs office suggests toning down the news release, changing \u201cillegal spying\u201d to \u201cintelligence gathering\u201d and \u201cmisuse of power\u201d to \u201cactions.\u201d\u201cMy big worry with Hollywood and the Snowden story is that they\u2019re either going to be cowards and completely drain it of its political vitality,\u201d Greenwald told me, \u201cor that they\u2019re going to do a superbiased smear job. For all the talk about how liberal Hollywood is, the reality is that they\u2019re really close to the government. And whatever other things you might say about Oliver, I was actually relieved that someone was going to do this film where there was no danger of those things happening.\u201dLike \u201cCitizenfour,\u201d \u201cSnowden\u201d takes place in Hong Kong, but this time the story has the eerie feeling of a familiar scene re-\u00adenacted by skilled Hollywood actors. Stone was right about Gordon-\u00adLevitt. His performance is not an interpretation so much as a direct replica of the whistle-\u00adblower\u2019s even demeanor and intonation. Quinto plays Greenwald with such intensity that he appears perpetually enraged. Melissa Leo\u2019s Poitras is in turn warm and protective, almost maternal.Stone came in just as the credits rolled. He was nursing a cold but was back on caffeine and asked his assistant for Bulletproof, the trendy coffee brand made with \u201cgrass-fed butter.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be nutritional,\u201d Stone said. \u201cNo radicals.\u201dSince I last saw him, the film\u2019s release had been pushed from December 2015 to May 2016 as Stone rushed to complete it, and then once more to September 2016. The biggest challenge was pacing. Stone likes to structure his movies around a series of plot-\u00adpivoting, battlelike scenes \u2014 the concerts in \u201cThe Doors,\u201d the football games in \u201cAny Given Sunday\u201d or actual warfare in \u201cAlexander.\u201d A story in which the drama hinges on a tech specialist downloading classified documents was more subdued than he was accustomed to. \u201cCoding is not exciting,\u201d Stone said. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s a nerdlike behavior \u2014 it\u2019s dull on a screen.\u201dStone got around the tedium of reality by turning his film into a cross between a cyberthriller and a love story, using Snowden\u2019s relationship with Mills to inject emotional stakes. Cutting between Snowden in Hong Kong and flashbacks to his past, the film speeds through Snowden\u2019s biography with the help of techno music, snappy explanations of N.S.A. programs and tricky camerawork to build in the tension of surveillance. (There are scenes filmed from the perspective of tiny phone cameras \u2014 the modern peephole \u2014 and suggestive zoom-ins on eye pupils.)But there are also unmistakable Stone-isms. \u201cI just don\u2019t really like bashing my country,\u201d Gordon-\u00adLevitt says to Woodley as they stroll past a Bush-\u00adera antiwar protest in front of the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s my country, too,\u201d Woodley says. \u201cAnd right now, it\u2019s got blood on its hands.\u201dSnowden\u2019s N.S.A. boss is unsubtly named Corbin O\u2019Brian, after the antagonist in Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984.\u201d \u201cMost Americans don\u2019t want freedom,\u201d O\u2019Brian tells Snowden. \u201cThey want security.\u201dSnowden\u2019s many storytellers all tell a similar hero narrative. But if Greenwald\u2019s account is about journalism, Poitras\u2019s is a subtle and artful character study and Kucherena\u2019s is an attempt at the Russian novel \u2014 a man alone in a room, wrestling with his conscience \u2014 Stone\u2019s is the explicit blockbuster version, told in high gloss with big, emotional music and digestible plot points that will appeal to mass audiences. As Wizner wisely anticipated, it is the narrative most likely to cement Snowden\u2019s story in Americans\u2019 minds.Snowden declined to comment for this article, but Stone told me he had seen the film and liked it. At a screening at Comic-\u00adCon a few months later, Snowden would beam in via satellite to give his somewhat wary approval. \u201cIt was something that made me really nervous,\u201d he said of Stone\u2019s film. \u201cBut I think he made it work.\u201dAs Stone intended, Snowden shows up at the end of the film. He appears in a wood-\u00adpaneled room in Kucherena\u2019s dacha, a modest, foreign-\u00adlooking space, with little to see except a vase of flowers and some curtains in the background. The Snowden who speaks is not the stoic version, but one who manages to deliver a Stone-\u00adcaliber movie line. \u201cI no longer have to worry about what happens tomorrow,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause I\u2019m happy with what I\u2019ve done today.\u201d Just before the screen fades to black, Snowden is shown gazing toward a window, a faint, inscrutable smile on his face.Gordon-\u00adLevitt was so moved by Snowden\u2019s story that he donated most of his salary from the film to the A.C.L.U. and used the rest to collaborate with Wizner on a series of videos about democracy. Wizner was preparing to petition Obama to grant Snowden a presidential pardon in the fall, and he hoped Stone\u2019s film would help transform the public\u2019s perception of his client. Kucherena, meanwhile, had turned \u201cTime of the Octopus\u201d into a trilogy \u2014 in the sequel, the N.S.A. sends an assassin to Russia to \u201celiminate\u201d Joshua Cold. He hoped to come to the United States for the premiere of the film, in which he has a cameo as a Russian banker who encounters Snowden at a party. \u201cIf I can get a visa, why not?\u201d he said.In July, Stone and Wizner joined forces for an A.C.L.U. event. The evening was billed as a conversation with Wizner about surveillance and Edward Snowden, with Stone hosting at his Tudor-\u00adstyle home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles.As several dozen West Coast supporters of the A.C.L.U. filtered into Stone\u2019s backyard, the director sat camped out on a bench by the pool, taking the party in from a distance. He boasted that he had recently cut four more minutes from the film, bringing the run time to a lean 134 minutes. I asked if he would keep finessing until the end. \u201cNo, it\u2019s over,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is it. Now I die.\u201dWizner roamed around, inspecting a meditation gazebo outfitted with a large gold Buddha. After several people inquired who was playing him in the movie, the lawyer came up with a pithy reply. \u201cKevin Spacey, reprising his role as Keyser Soze,\u201d he joked. \u201cThe guy behind the guy behind the guy \u2014 hiding in plain sight.\u201d (Wizner is not a character in Stone\u2019s film.)That week, NPR ran an interview with a Russian security official who posited that Snowden is maybe, probably, most definitely cooperating with Russian intelligence. This inevitably set Wizner off. \u201cOf course, this is the same week that Snowden is blasting Putin on Twitter every day,\u201d Wizner said to Borman, who nodded along. The producer suggested that Snowden\u2019s critics would claim it\u2019s a cover. \u201cThat\u2019s what they say!\u201d Wizner said. \u201cThis is preapproved criticism so that it\u2019ll seem like he\u2019s free, but actually Putin is the master pulling the strings.\u201dEventually, everyone moved to the den, a spacious, brightly lit room filled with family photos. Matthew Weiner, the \u201cMad Men\u201d creator, took a seat by a stack of DVDs, which included multiple seasons of his own hit TV show. Others arranged themselves along wicker chairs that lined the room\u2019s perimeter. The whole thing had the feeling of a P.T.A. meeting, but without the stale cookies.Wizner got up and spoke for some time about his efforts as Snowden\u2019s lawyer. As he opened the room to questions, someone asked how long Russia could be relied on to keep Snowden safe. Wizner turned the question over to Stone. \u201cOliver is the Russia expert,\u201d he said with a hint of passive-\u00adaggression. Since completing \u201cSnowden,\u201d Stone had become absorbed in his newfound interest in Russia and announced that he was making a documentary about Putin. In recent months, he had accompanied the Russian president to a theater performance and a World War II Victory Day parade in Moscow. \u201cHe represents a different point of view that Americans don\u2019t want to hear,\u201d Stone had told RIA Novosti, a Russian news service.When someone else asked about Stone\u2019s experience of making \u201cSnowden,\u201d his answer was despondent. \u201cIt was really a horrible experience in every way,\u201d he said. Everyone laughed except for Stone.As the guests dispersed, Wizner lingered in the foyer, admiring Stone\u2019s art collection depicting important and mostly dead men. He thought that a print of Jean-Paul Sartre looked like Steve Buscemi and that a pained-\u00adlooking Beethoven was actually Stone. On the opposite wall was a sketch of Genghis Khan, the feared Mongolian emperor. Stone called him a liberal.\u201cYes, Genghis Khan \u2014 misunderstood,\u201d Wizner teased.Stone smiled and cocked his head. \u201cListen, the A.C.L.U. should defend him!\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lyft Declined G.M. Takeover Effort, but Rivals Could Force Its Hand", "Date": "2016-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsIt was probably only a matter of time before G.M. made a move, after it paid $500 million in January for a stake in Lyft and took a seat on Lyft\u2019s board. In March, the companies unveiled a deal to lease G.M. vehicles to Lyft drivers. They also plan to collaborate on building a fleet of autonomous on-demand vehicles.Speculation about Lyft\u2019s future heated up in June when information emerged that the company had hired the Silicon Valley investment bank Qatalyst Partners, which was founded by Frank Quattrone. Qatalyst is known for helping clients find lucrative exits.Despite the mounting pressures, it\u2019s understandable that Lyft\u2019s founders, Logan Green and John Zimmer, would want to try to stay independent, at least for a while longer. G.M. has been investing heavily in driverless technology, but so have many of its peers, as well as the likes of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, and Apple. So there is no guarantee the carmaker will come up with a winning product.With software, rather than powertrain, a valuable component of autonomous vehicles, Lyft has little incentive to sell for anything other than top dollar. It would also presumably find it easier to recruit top programming talent as an independent company.Lyft may run out of road eventually. Being second to the much-larger Uber is a major disadvantage in an industry where drivers and riders prefer the largest, most active network. An expensive battle for ride-hailing supremacy would distract from the bigger prize: a chance to fundamentally disrupt car ownership with driverless technology \u2014 an opportunity Mr. Zimmer estimates is worth over $2 trillion per year in the United States alone, including the cost of buying, maintaining and insuring cars. That may ultimately direct Lyft to seek an off-ramp that leads to G.M. It just has to hope that when it does, G.M. is still willing to take the wheel.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Betting Billions on Rio, Comcast Hopes to Win the Future of Television", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMediatorIt was the equivalent of the Yankees losing Derek Jeter just before the World Series. Mr. Ebersol had made the Olympics central to the NBC brand for two decades, and he was hands-down the American television executive best connected to Olympic officials in Switzerland.Mr. Roberts, a second-generation cable executive but a newbie in broadcast television, faced two seemingly bad options: He could break with Mr. Ebersol\u2019s legacy and go down in television history as the person who failed to keep the Olympics in the NBC stable or he could become known as the person who lost by keeping them.The rights were going to cost many billions of dollars, and NBC had lost more than $200 million on the 2010 Vancouver Games, an ominous harbinger. Mr. Roberts and his executive team \u2014 including Mr. Ebersol\u2019s successor, Mark Lazarus, and the NBCUniversal chief executive Steve Burke \u2014 had less than 30 days to figure it out. \u201cIt was a really stressful time,\u201d he told me in an interview on Wednesday.In short, Team Comcast bet the store, or, at least, a quarter of it. And they did it for what some analysts were calling \u201ca loss leader,\u201d something that was good for the brand, maybe, but bad for the bottom line. Or so it seemed.This year, the risk is starting to make sense, and it has to do with not only profits \u2014 which are considerable \u2014 but also the future of television and the way people watch it.First, there\u2019s the profit part.Comcast and NBC expect a record take from the Rio Games, which start Friday. They have already drawn more than $1.2 billion in ad sales, and receipts are continuing to come in.But in that environment, big-ticket live sports broadcasts have emerged as the last refuge for advertisers distraught by the slow death of the 30-second commercial, which is under siege from DVRs and online programming. The Olympics \u2014 like the Super Bowl or the World Cup \u2014 are best enjoyed live, when commercials still work the old fashioned way; they sneak up on you during breaks.\u201cTV is the best in terms of drawing people together and aggregating large audiences,\u201d Mr. Roberts said.It doesn\u2019t hurt that this year\u2019s Games are taking place one hour later than Eastern time, meaning Americans can easily watch them as they\u2019re happening, rather than on the dreaded tape delay (potentially after they already know the results).But more important to Comcast, and the entire media industry, is the future-of-television part of this equation.The trends that are causing television audiences to erode are not promising to abate any time soon. Alternative entertainment and media options continue to proliferate. But Comcast and NBC are using that as an opportunity during the Olympics; they are planning to fill every stream \u2014 on cable and the internet \u2014 as never before.To understand how significant a change this is, Mr. Roberts pointed to the last time the Summer Olympics were truly taking place live in prime time: the Atlanta Games in 1996.\u201cTwenty years ago, there was something like 170 hours of live content on one channel,\u201d Mr. Roberts said. \u201cNow we\u2019ll have 6,800 hours on 11 channels, and up to 41 live streams. So that\u2019s effectively 52 channels with 6,800 hours versus one channel with 170 hours.\u201dIt\u2019s also a ridiculous amount of content. Just think about it: How do you navigate that much sports? And do you even want to?In full promotional mode, Mr. Roberts told me, 21st Century Fox is media and Google is technology. \u201cWe are at the cross-section between media and technology.\u201dGot that, 21st Century Fox and Google (now called Alphabet)? Of course, their executive chairmen \u2014 Rupert Murdoch and Eric Schmidt \u2014 would most likely beg to differ (and they are welcome to call me anytime to discuss it).A lot can still go wrong: the Zika virus; serious concerns about water quality, and that small matter of the Russian doping scandal that resulted in the disqualification of more than 100 athletes.\u201cYou can only control what you can control,\u201d Mr. Roberts said. And should the worst fears come to pass, he said, \u201cWe will report on all the reality of Rio \u2014 we\u2019re not trying to in any way make light of any serious issues.\u201dAnd of course, profits are never guaranteed, as Vancouver proved. Mr. Roberts said he was still optimistic, and predicted these would be \u201ca very profitable Olympics,\u201d and possibly, \u201cthe largest aggregated audience in the history of television.\u201dThe Olympics\u2019 place at the heart of NBC\u2019s brand was a passion for Mr. Ebersol, a classic programmer from a bygone era. Comcast could have used the billions it spent on the Olympics on something else. Its decision to go all-in was predicated on a new bet \u2014 that for all their new options, Americans still want a big shared experience like the Olympics, and that big-ticket events are still part of the television future. All it takes is $12 billion and a dream.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Intel\u2019s New Mission: Find Fresh Uses for Its Famous Paranoia", "Date": "2016-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsThat sounds cool, if you like your capitalism fierce. That idea, however, turns out to have some significant downsides.Intel is the world\u2019s biggest semiconductor company because when Mr. Grove was in charge, it dominated the personal computer industry and was an important player in the associated business in computer servers.Today, the PC market is shrinking, hurting Intel\u2019s profits. The server-chip industry is still strong, thanks to the rise of cloud computing at companies like Facebook and Google. Cloud companies engineer server chips in ways that make very powerful and flexible systems used by millions of people.But Intel missed joining a number of other markets that did not look like the PC business, particularly smartphones. It is scrambling for a place in sensors (or what is called the internet of things), wireless networking, autonomous vehicles and other hot areas, as computing spreads from traditional computers to nearly every machine.\u201cThe mistake was, when you grow with great leadership and great success, your paranoia is focused on the one thing that is delivering that,\u201d Brian Krzanich, Intel\u2019s current chief executive, said in an interview.From PC-dominated computing, he said, we are now \u201cwhere computing is constantly shifting.\u201d Mr. Krzanich says he is still a strong believer in paranoia, but he must turn that vigilant anxiety in a lot of directions at once. Cloud computing may be Intel\u2019s core, but Mr. Krzanich has to feed it from chips in many markets.The effect of those changes will be seen this week as Intel holds its Developer Forum in San Francisco. The conference is where the hard-core geeks of computing gather to hear about what\u2019s coming in the realms of processing power, memory and other technology that enables the modern world.Giant tech trade shows like the International CES, held in Las Vegas every January, are focused on hot products. Developer events may be nerd-fests, but they say more about the technology world, and where a company hopes to be in two or three years.Shifting gears for the giant chip company is no easy task. \u201cIntel has four main business lines \u2014 PCs, mobile, internet of things and servers \u2014 and it\u2019s hitting on one of them,\u201d said Patrick Gelsinger, a longtime Intel executive who is now chief executive of the software company VMware. The factories where Intel builds chips \u201cnow cost $10 billion, at least,\u201d each to set up, he said, \u201cand the competition is catching up.\u201dIn April, Intel announced it was cutting its work force by 12,000 people, about 11 percent of workers. About a quarter of the executives who report to Mr. Krzanich come from other companies, a big deal at a place where leaders rise through the ranks over decades.In his speech, Mr. Krzanich may stay away from talking about wearable devices. Last month, Intel withdrew a health-monitoring watch that had some nice capabilities but sometimes burned its wearers\u2019 skin. Even so, Mr. Krzanich said, the heart-monitoring capabilities of that watch will find their way into a device Intel plans to make with the athletics brand New Balance.The part he is looking forward to, Mr. Krzanich said, is a one-hour question-and-answer session with 200 elite developers. \u201cIt\u2019s a much broader group\u201d than even a couple of years ago, he said. \u201cPeople writing for machine learning and A.I., networking chips, how virtual reality feeds into PCs.\u201d Even in decline, PC chips still make up half of Intel\u2019s revenue.If these things catch on, Intel will sell more chips to those businesses and create new demand for cloud computing, because most devices are now connected to the cloud.Even so, another pillar of the Intel mythology, the unchanging nature of Moore\u2019s Law, is getting revised. Named for the Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, it states that a chip\u2019s power doubles every 18 to 24 months without a rise in costs. Mr. Grove\u2019s paranoia championed and fed on Moore\u2019s Law, as Intel strove to achieve profit from that computing cadence.Silicon Valley treats Moore\u2019s Law as if it is immutable, and with even more reverence than it does paranoia. But it was not a scientific law; it was always an observation about the behavior of a market for computers and software, which paid off at a rate to justify increasing investment in making chips.That is why Intel is in the wireless and networking fields, and is working on a new kind of three-dimensional memory chip, which Mr. Krzanich said would be out at the end of this year, that can speed performance of big-data-type calculations sevenfold.There would be a historical precedent to that shift. Years ago, Intel\u2019s main business was in memory chips, a market that collapsed three decades ago, leading the company to move toward making number-crunching processors for PCs. That shift, which arguably saved the company, was the lesson that led to Mr. Grove\u2019s paranoia.Advertisement"}
