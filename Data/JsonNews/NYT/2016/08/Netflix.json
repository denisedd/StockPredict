{"Headline": "1.28 Billion Minutes Streamed (and NBC Is Still Counting)", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTV SportsSTAMFORD, Conn. \u2014 NBC Sports\u2019 promise to stream every sport live at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro is fulfilled here at its headquarters \u2014 a former Clairol factory \u2014 where the digital feeds from every event are sent to tablets, computers, smartphones and other connected devices. They are visible on flat screens throughout the vast broadcast operations center \u2014 mosaics of sports that are being played simultaneously.Streaming is a part of NBC\u2019s Olympic future \u2014 an extension and repudiation of a history in which the prime-time broadcast was not to be trifled with. But the new model is unfolding in Rio: unfettered live streaming of all events and live Olympic programming on NBCUniversal\u2019s cable networks, combined with NBC\u2019s traditional prime-time broadcast, which has live and taped elements.Through Thursday, NBC\u2019s live streaming had reached 1.28 billion minutes \u2014 more than in all of the 2012 London Olympics. The minutes have helped NBC add the equivalent of a few hundred thousand viewers to a prime-time broadcast audience that has fallen since 2012. Still, NBC\u2019s streaming is less than halfway to the 2.6 billion live minutes that ESPN streamed during the 2014 World Cup.\u201cGoing past one billion minutes \u2014 I\u2019m impressed, excited and overjoyed,\u201d said Eric Black, the chief technology officer of NBC Sports Group Digital, who has watched Olympic streaming advance, sometimes fitfully, over several Olympics. He recalled an unexpectedly large surge of streaming during the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, for the men\u2019s United States-Russia preliminary-round game in hockey, at 7:30 a.m. Eastern.\u201cWe expected an O.K. crowd, but it went viral, and went to a shootout,\u201d he said. \u201cThe numbers rose dramatically, and we had to add more video sources to back it up.\u201d Nearly 600,000 unique users streamed the game, the most in Olympic hockey\u2019s short online viewing history.16 PhotosSo far in Rio, that number has been eclipsed by five streams: two from swimming, the opening ceremony (which was not shown live), and the women\u2019s gymnastics all-around final (1.16 million) and team final (1.35 million).By comparison, the average World Cup game on ESPN two years ago averaged about 900,000 unique users.Chris Reed, a freelance writer and publicist in Los Angeles, said in an interview Friday that he had been streaming gymnastics live in the afternoon on his tablet because he was unwilling to wait until NBC showed it on a tape delay on the West Coast.\u201cTake gymnastics yesterday,\u201d he said, referring to the all-around final won by Simone Biles of the United States. \u201cDo I stay up until midnight to see how they did and avoid all social media, or watch it live? The answer was to watch it live and celebrate with the rest of the country.\u201dStreaming has become an essential way to view sports and entertainment as people change the way they consume media: cutting the cords to their subscriptions with satellite, cable and telephone companies; binge-watching new series on internet services like Netflix and Amazon; and choosing mobile devices for watching the sports that they (or their parents) once tuned in to their televisions for.The NBC building is in full Olympics mode, and not only for streaming. It is a bustling northern outpost of the International Broadcast Center in Rio. One of its large studios is filled with portable announcing and production booths where announcers call many of the sports NBC is showing, from archery and badminton to rugby and weight lifting. They describe the action using video feeds from Rio with the ambient sounds of the venues piped to their headsets. In one quirk of the setup, Mary Carillo calls tennis from the broadcast center in Brazil; one of her partners, Rennae Stubbs, speaks from one of the booths in Stamford; and a reporter works on site at the tennis arena.Black and his staff spend much of their time making sure the live streams run without serious glitches, a task that was largely unheard-of when he began working in the early 2000s as the webmaster at WNBC-TV\u2019s website in New York. \u201cWe pointed a camera at the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree \u2014 it was like Yule log \u2014 and people watched it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you think about it, that was pretty advanced for 2002.\u201dOn a wall in Black\u2019s office is a large heat map \u2014 its colors ranging from pale yellow to dark orange \u2014 that shows the number of concurrent video feeds scheduled, in 15-minute intervals, to be streamed or televised by the NBC networks carrying the Rio Games every day. The peak was reached last Saturday when about 50 feeds were live simultaneously, 40 of them streams produced by the Olympics\u2019 world broadcaster.\u201cMy 5-year-old godson loves it that Uncle Eric makes it possible to watch soccer on the iPhone,\u201d Black said.Although he is a devoted fan of New York teams and of boxing, his job has led him to redefine what his favorite sports are.They are, he said, \u201cthe streams that start and end successfully.\u201dHe added, \u201cAfter we streamed our first Super Bowl, I had no idea who won.\u201dBut those who stream often care, some quite deeply, in a world where people want to be entertained on demand \u2014 and buffering of the live hammer throw or trouble signing on to NBCOlympics.com can be causes for an angry tweet.Email: sandor@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}

But \u201cNarcos\u201d is not about good American cops that go to a South American country to save poor people from a bad guy. We wanted to be as accurate and respectful as we could about Colombia\u2019s history, and the D.E.A. guys are not exactly the heroes of this story. The heroes of \u201cNarcos\u201d are the Colombian people who fought and decided to do something about the horrible narco-terrorism that took place in their country back in the \u201980s.I didn\u2019t see why not. It feels wrong to extend the life of this guy beyond two seasons.What will you miss most about playing Escobar?[Deep breath, long pause.] It was a very important part of my life. I dedicated a lot to this character. I moved to Medell\u00edn \u2014 Netflix didn\u2019t even know I was being considered to play the part, and I was already there, studying Spanish. Brazil is very culturally isolated in South America because we speak Portuguese, so it was a very deep cultural experience for me as a Brazilian, working with these actors from Latin America. I brought my kids to live there, and they learned Spanish, too. It was great. But when we wrapped the second season, I felt relieved.Why?It was time to let that character go and get rid of that body, get back to my former weight. That wasn\u2019t my body. I was living in his body for two years, and I\u2019m not only talking about the physical body, but also the energy I was dealing with. It wasn\u2019t nice at all.There have been lots of movies and shows about Pablo Escobar. After two seasons of \u201cNarcos,\u201d have you now played him for longer than anyone else?So it\u2019s not like Escobar had an evil twin or something. Or a kind twin, I guess.He was mean; he was a horrible human being. He was responsible for a lot of deaths and horrible things. But it\u2019s undeniable that he was different from the other guys.Advertisement"}

Notably, however, Time Warner will hold a smaller stake in Hulu than other major investors and refrain from joining a board already crowded by rivals like Walt Disney, 21st Century Fox and Comcast.Hulu has charted a rocky path since it was started in 2007. Owners clashed over competing ideas and agendas, including trying to protect lucrative fees collected by cable operators to carry their networks. Twice, the service has been put up for sale. A private equity backer sold out. Comcast\u2019s involvement was hamstrung by regulators as part of its acquisition of NBC Universal. Along the way, Hulu lost its highly regarded chief executive.Despite the turmoil, Hulu has benefited from consumers who are increasingly watching TV shows and movies when they want and on devices of their choosing. Hulu has quadrupled the number of paying customers in four years to 12 million, pulling in at least $1.2 billion from those on the lowest plan at $8 a month. That does not include advertising revenue, which Credit Suisse estimates will be $850 million this year.Time Warner\u2019s 10 percent stake, at a $5.8 billion valuation for Hulu, precedes a planned introduction of Hulu\u2019s live-streaming service next year. That feature will distinguish it from rivals like Amazon and Netflix, which trades at a higher multiple of sales than Hulu does based on its new investment. For now, only shows from the Turner networks will be available, though there are discussions about adding ones from Time Warner\u2019s HBO, home to the hit \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201dHulu will pay Time Warner for the shows, in much the same way that traditional cable companies pay fees to Time Warner. In that sense, at least some of the money from Time Warner will boomerang back to it. Jeffrey Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, emphasized on Wednesday that his company\u2019s investment would give Hulu more programming firepower. Doing so without muscling in too much on the operations may give the joint venture a better shot at success.Advertisement"}

She plans to order new testing, some of which was not possible during the original trial.She hopes that the new evidence, combined with new theories and the revisiting of old evidence, could be enough to free Mr. Avery, 54.\u201cThere is evidence that already exists in the case that points to a different location and a different suspect,\u201d Ms. Zellner said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a combination of forensic evidence and a tip from somebody that we\u2019ve interviewed multiple times that we think is credible.\u201dHer alternate-suspect theory has not been presented before, she said. But she declined to elaborate, saying details would emerge after the new forensic testing.Prosecutors cited several pieces of physical evidence linking Mr. Avery to the crime when he was convicted. Investigators discovered:\u25a0 His blood in Ms. Halbach\u2019s car, which was found on his salvage yard property;\u25a0 His sweat under the latch of her car\u2019s hood;\u25a0 Her DNA on a bullet in his garage;\u25a0 And his DNA on a key to her car that was found in his bedroom.Ms. Zellner said new forms of testing could prove that the physical evidence had been planted, echoing a prominent suggestion of the Netflix series. Most of the tests can be done within a few weeks, she said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s possible all of it will be done within 60 days.\u201dShe added: \u201cIt may not all be successful, but I believe if even one bit of evidence is planted, the conviction is going to be vacated.\u201dHe will be released from prison unless the authorities decide within 90 days to schedule a new trial. The judge\u2019s ruling does not directly affect Mr. Avery\u2019s case.At this point, Ms. Zellner\u2019s arguments for Mr. Avery\u2019s innocence are absent any point-by-point rebuttal from prosecutors, as would happen in a trial.\u201cThe attorney general and Wisconsin Department of Justice will make their arguments in court and feel confident Mr. Avery\u2019s conviction will be upheld,\u201d Johnny Koremenos, a spokesman for Attorney General Brad Schimel, said in a statement.\u201cOf course, the attorney general wants to see justice prevail and will evaluate any new, credible evidence brought forward.\u201d\u201cSteven Avery committed this murder and this mutilation, and Steven Avery is exactly where he needs to be,\u201d he said.\u201cMaking a Murderer,\u201d the 10-part series created by Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos, focused on the intertwined cases of Mr. Avery and Mr. Dassey and left doubts about the legitimacy of their convictions.Before the murder case unfolded, Mr. Avery was convicted of sexual assault in 1985, spending 18 years in prison \u2014 only to be exonerated in 2003. Less than two years after his release, he was arrested in the killing of Ms. Halbach, who had gone to his property to photograph a car for Auto Trader magazine.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a more graphic, compelling illustration of a crime scene that was fabricated,\u201d she said.The documentary raised the possibility that Mr. Avery\u2019s blood that was recovered from the inside Ms. Halbach\u2019s car had been planted from a vial collected in 1996 for the sexual assault case.Ms. Zellner said one of the tests she hopes to run will date Mr. Avery\u2019s blood used as evidence in the murder conviction.Additional tests would identify the source of other physical evidence cited by prosecutors. For instance, the lawyer says that among the evidence she believes had been planted is Ms. Halbach\u2019s bones, which were found in a burn pit on his property.Ms. Zellner also points to Ms. Halbach\u2019s car, where Mr. Avery\u2019s blood was found in the front and Ms. Halbach\u2019s was found in the back. The forensic scientists she spoke to said there would likely be a mixture of their blood, she said.\u201cThis is a crime scene that just doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d she said.New experts would speak to the findings from those new tests, she said. One expert \u201ccould have been called at the trial but wasn\u2019t,\u201d she added.Mr. Avery\u2019s past legal maneuverings have failed.A federal judge denied his request for a new trial in 2010, and the Wisconsin Supreme Court declined to review the case. He filed an appeal on his own behalf in January; it is pending. He remains imprisoned in the Waupun Correctional Institution in Waupon, Wisc.Ms. Zellner said her interest was not in the existing appeal, which would not allow her to present new evidence. She said she intended to take it to the trial-court level and request an evidentiary hearing for the new material.She said she believed he\u2019s innocent. She said she had visited Mr. Avery in prison after Mr. Dassey\u2019s ruling, and he appeared happy and shocked by the news.\u201cI think he just couldn\u2019t believe anything good had happened,\u201d she said.Netflix has signed on for a second season of \u201cMaking a Murderer,\u201d and Ms. Zellner has granted the filmmakers interviews. No release date has been revealed.Ms. Ricciardi and Ms. Demos said in a statement, \u201cAs we have done for the past 10 years, we will continue to document the story as it unfolds, and follow it wherever it may lead.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The script attracted Mr. Shyamalan\u2019s attention, and the brothers were hired to consult and write for the first season of the Fox series \u201cWayward Pines,\u201d for which Mr. Shyamalan was an executive producer. In a recent phone interview, the Duffers, 32, explained the genesis and influences of \u201cStranger Things.\u201d These are edited excerpts from the conversation.What was your pitch for this show?We wrote one script for it, the pilot, which is very close to the first episode as it exists now. And then we made a 20-page pitch book, where we took an old Stephen King book cover, and we had a lot of imagery from a lot of the movies that we\u2019re referencing.The first week, I think, we had 15 pitches, and it was all passes. There was a moment where we\u2019re like, \u201cOh, I think people aren\u2019t getting it.\u201d And then the next week, offers started to come in, and luckily Netflix understood it right away.And you knew you wanted this to be a TV series \u2014 this was not a film idea?If you\u2019re given a second season, would you pick up immediately where it left off, or would you let time pass?How long did it take to cast the kids?At their ages, they might not know the reference points for the nostalgia in the show \u2014 did you give them homework assignments?The \u201980s pop culture references in the show have themes in which the idyllic American small town life is destroyed. And there\u2019s the underlying Communist threat in the show, which was an element in certain movies of that time \u2014 what is it about this particular era?How is it working together? Do you finish each other\u2019s sentences? Were the films you were making in third grade about similar topics?When you were kids, what scared you?What scares you now?Advertisement"}

The movie \u201cCaptain America: Civil War\u201d features three black superheroes, while \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d features two.\u201cThe Get Down\u201d is categorically different from those projects, but it raises a similarly radical proposition: that everyday teenagers \u2014 the show also anoints Hispanic heroes \u2014 imbued with obsession and determination can invent a whole new world and make the old one bend to their whims.That supernatural approach to teenage creativity in the face of ruin had its roots in the role models of the 1970s, drawn from comic books and kung fu films.

When Grandmaster Flash is first revealed in the pilot, it\u2019s done slowly. Up until that point, Shaolin Fantastic is painted as the show\u2019s idol, all fleet moves and fast hands.

The story then moves to full dimensional puppet stop-motion.The adventures of the Little Prince are executed using a sparse, stop-motion technique. Mr. Caliri and his team worked to make the puppets for the sequence out of paper, something that Mr. Osborne said he wouldn\u2019t have thought of.\u201cEvery shot in stop-motion where the character is acting, they would have to rebuild the costume afterward because it would tear and rip,\u201d Mr. Osborne said. \u201cBut it\u2019s in keeping with one of the major themes of the story, which is that anything beautiful is ephemeral.\u201dMr. Osborne saw this delicate technique as the ideal way to visualize a delicate story. He said that when some people first saw this section, they thought it was CG pretending to be stop-motion.\u201cBut I don\u2019t think CG could have ever emulated the kind of organic detail that you get when you are actually building things like this.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Subscribe and Save on Amazon? Don\u2019t Count on It", "Date": "2016-08-24", "News": "Supported byTech FixWHAT do subscriptions to a newspaper, magazine or Netflix account have in common? Once you sign up, you expect to pay the same rate every month.I learned this the hard way while reviewing an email summary of my Amazon subscriptions. A pack of lint rollers that I had subscribed to for more than two years recently jumped to $18.04 a pack, up from $12.44 since the last delivery a few months ago, or almost a 50 percent increase.Amazon declined to comment. The company emails people 10 days before a recurring subscription delivery, when it informs customers of a new price of their item so they can change or skip the order.Any sticker shock, analysts said, may be the result of Amazon\u2019s complex pricing system coming into conflict with consumer expectations of a traditional subscription.Jared Wiesel, a partner at Revenue Analytics, a pricing and sales consulting firm, said of Amazon, \u201cI think they\u2019ve violated the psychological concept of a subscription with their customers in changing prices like this. When people think of a subscription, they think of locking in a set cadence of receiving a good.\u201dAmazon\u2019s dynamic pricing system, in which it frequently adjusts item prices based on a sophisticated set of variables like supply and demand, time of day and prices offered by competitors, is the company\u2019s way of making it look as if you are always getting the best deal, Mr. Wiesel said.Prices of goods can also fall, of course. But even when prices decline, people need to beware because Amazon\u2019s pricing tends to fluctuate more widely and more frequently than at your local grocery store or Walmart, Mr. Wiesel added. In traditional retail, the major price changes typically happen during promotions, he said.Prices of most items, including dishwasher soap and toilet bowl cleaner, changed frequently. As often as weekly, prices rose, dipped and rose again like a roller coaster. In extreme cases, prices for items like instant coffee and napkins jumped between 90 and 170 percent. (Prices below reflect subscription discounts.)\u2022 Folgers Coffee, 30.5-Ounce Tub\u2022 Vanity Fair Napkins______Only five of the Subscribe & Save items held steady.\u2022 Sparkle Paper Towels\u2022 Death Wish CoffeeAfter the service\u2019s 5 percent discount, the paper towels cost $24.69 and the coffee cost $18.99. Not bad.______In the end, whether you save money depends on when your subscription order is placed and what items you buy. The downside of buying through Amazon\u2019s subscription program is the lack of predictability, Mr. Wiesel said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen this type of price fluctuation in a brick-and-mortar store,\u201d he added. Some highlights over the last six months (with subscription discounts applied):\u2022 GermGuardian Air Purifier Replacement Filter\u2022 Honeywell Humidifier Replacement Filter\u2022 Lysol Disinfecting Wipes (3-Pack)______Mr. Wiesel noted that it would be tough for Amazon to revise its subscription program to offer items at fixed rates. A majority of sales on Amazon are one-time purchases, and dynamic pricing is fundamental to how the company operates. If, for example, Subscribe & Save prices remained static, those customers could miss out when prices go down for one-time purchases of the same products.If you truly want to save money on Amazon, one approach is to sign up for price alerts on Camel Camel Camel to get an email when a price drops to a desired amount. When that happens, manually reorder \u2014 yes, that\u2019s an extra step \u2014 your instant coffee, toilet cleaner or lint rollers.Sucharita Mulpuru-Kodali, an analyst for Forrester Research who follows Amazon, said the retailer was probably pushing prices up to test how loyal customers are to products and how much more they are willing to pay for them. Yet the sharp price changes on Subscribe & Save items caught her by surprise.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem as customer-friendly as Amazon typically is,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s unusual.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Will\u2019s friends Mike, Lucas and Dustin team up with Eleven (El for short) to find him and fight a monster that puts the whole town at risk.In the process, the boys don\u2019t just go on unsupervised bike trips. They also manage to hide El in Mike\u2019s basement for days without his parents finding out. Though the parents are loving and generally responsible, this is the \u201980s, and they just aren\u2019t watching their son that closely.There is only one character who could be called a helicopter parent, and he\u2019s the nightmarish Dr. Martin Brenner, the scientist who raised El. He kept her hidden deep within his lab and forced her to take part in sometimes violent experiments to hone her supernatural powers. After her escape, he sends a small army of G-men to search for her.The boys have their problems, too. Will disappears after he bikes home from Mike\u2019s house and finds his own home empty. But the kids also manage to help save their town, thanks to El\u2019s special powers.Permissiveness has always been a luxury \u2014 parents in violent neighborhoods have good reason to keep their kids close. And lack of supervision can be frightening \u2014 when Will came home that fateful night, he needed his mom.Still, \u201cStranger Things\u201d is a reminder of a kind of unstructured childhood wandering that \u2014 because of all the cellphones, the fear of child molesters, a move toward more involved parenting or a combination of all three \u2014 seems less possible than it once was.The show\u2019s references to beloved films of the \u201980s have been much remarked upon, but \u201cStranger Things\u201d also calls to mind all those books and TV shows \u2014 from \u201cThe Chronicles of Narnia\u201d to \u201cMuppet Babies\u201d \u2014 where parents are either absent or pushed into the background.These stories let children imagine breaking the rules, but they also allow them to picture themselves solving mysteries or hunting down monsters all on their own. Often it\u2019s only when the parents aren\u2019t watching that a child can become a hero.America may be especially ripe for such stories just now. As mass shootings and terrorist attacks dominate the news \u2014 and as Donald Trump makes dire pronouncements about crime and crises \u2014 the world can seem more dangerous than ever. And yet from the free-range kids movement to parenting books that promote more freedom, there\u2019s a dawning acknowledgment that something is lost when parents try too hard to protect their children. A show like \u201cStranger Things\u201d doesn\u2019t tell us that the world is safe, because it isn\u2019t, but it\u2019s a reminder that bravery needs its own space to grow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Time Warner Acquires 10% Stake in Hulu", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTime Warner announced on Wednesday that it had joined forces with several rival media companies to chart a new future for the streaming television service Hulu, acquiring a 10 percent stake in it and committing programming for its new live TV offering.Time Warner paid $583 million in cash for the stake, valuing Hulu at $5.8 billion, an executive said during a conference call on Wednesday. Hulu\u2019s other corporate owners are 21st Century Fox, Comcast and the Walt Disney Company.The development makes Time Warner \u201can official member of the \u2018cool kids\u2019 club,\u2019\u201d Todd Juenger, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, said in a research note.The new Hulu service is an attempt by its traditional entertainment company owners to secure their footing in television\u2019s digital future, where streaming has become the norm and competition from deep-pocketed rivals like Netflix and Amazon has intensified. Hulu has more than 10 million subscribers, compared with Netflix\u2019s 46 million paid subscribers in the United States.\u201cThis investment from Time Warner marks a major step for Hulu as we continue to redefine television for both consumers and advertisers,\u201d Mike Hopkins, Hulu\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement.The transaction came at a crucial time for Hulu. The service was \u201cfacing rapidly mounting losses approaching $500 million\u201d a year, according to Richard Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG Research. The investment from Time Warner reduces the amount of funding needed from its existing owners, he added.\u201cHulu is locked in a fierce battle for content with far larger Netflix and a far better funded Amazon, with Hulu\u2019s subbase not scaling as rapidly as we would expect based on its content investments,\u201d Mr. Greenfield said in a research note. \u201cIn turn, the Hulu partnership is eager to find additional partner(s) to enter the joint venture to help fund the losses, which are likely to increase meaningfully\u201d with the start of the new live service.Time Warner said that its TNT, TBS, CNN and other Turner cable networks would be available live and on demand on Hulu\u2019s new live-streaming service.\u201cOur investment in Hulu underscores Time Warner\u2019s commitment to supporting and developing new platforms for the delivery of high-quality content and great consumer experiences to audiences around the globe,\u201d Mr. Bewkes said.The transaction includes no representation on the board of Hulu, which gives Time Warner less say in dictating Hulu\u2019s destiny but also reduces the complicated ownership structure of the venture. Time Warner previously was in discussions about coming in as an equal partner in the venture, according to a person briefed on the discussions.\u201cWe don\u2019t have an active role, and coming in as the 10 percent investor without a board seat, we think it reduces complications around governance,\u201d Mr. Bewkes said during a conference call.He added that the transaction would infuse Hulu with more resources to \u201cfostering competition and innovation\u201d among streaming services as well as traditional cable and satellite distributors.One big concern about the new streamlined bundle from Hulu is that traditional cable and satellite distributors view it as a threat. That could put at risk the billions of dollars that the TV networks receive each year from those traditional distributors.Both Hulu and its corporate owners have downplayed those concerns, stating that it is designed for people who don\u2019t subscribe to a traditional pay television service.Total revenue was down 5 percent in the quarter to $7 billion, with a decline at the company\u2019s Warner Brothers film and television studios offset by growth at its Turner and HBO units.Advertisement"}

The show, a mixture of science fiction, fantasy and horror, has attracted attention for its use of popcorn cinema touchstones. But its score is perhaps the secret ingredient, a mixture of icy new-wave hooks, spooky ambient textures and menacing drones made by Kyle Dixon and Michael Stein, both Austin, Tex., musicians who play in a synth-driven quartet called Survive.Mr. Dixon and Mr. Stein jumped at the opportunity to work on the series, having compiled a library of material that didn\u2019t seem to fit with any of their other recording projects. A combination of songwriting techniques followed, from collaborative jamming to fleshing out demos that Mr. Stein recorded on his phone while working at a synth repair store.Mr. Dixon and Mr. Stein spoke recently by phone from Austin about how to make an audience hear an era and working on one of the summer\u2019s most popular TV shows. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Did the Duffers give you references from music of the period they wanted to evoke? When you got scenes, how much time would you have to turn something in?The score is woven in very subtly. As composers, did you feel the responsibility to step back, or to step in and illustrate things more? The show has gotten a lot of response because it nods to a certain period, but the sounds \u2014 not melodies, but tones \u2014 associated with music from that era may have an even stronger pull.

{"Headline": "The Florida Keys by Camper Van, With Baby", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "Supported byFrugal FamilyAt $120 a night during Florida\u2019s notorious spring break, the Art Deco Hotel Shelley had seemed like a bargain. It even included a free airport shuttle to the hotel\u2019s South Beach address, walking distance from where we would pick up our camper van rental the next morning before making a beeline for the Florida Keys. When the shuttle arrived, it was impossible to miss. Wrapped in a wheels-to-roof vinyl ad, the bus was a mobile billboard splashed with the racy, larger-than-life image of a buxom woman \u2014 her blond hair thrown back, her face flushed \u2014 being caressed by a masked man, red silk around his neck. Next to the door was a slogan: \u201cQuirky + Sexy + Chic No-Tell Hotels.\u201d My husband, infant daughter and I climbed aboard. I had, it seemed, booked my family at what in Mexico is artfully referred to as a \u201clove motel.\u201d Well, I thought, no \u201cMom of the Year\u201d award for me.We staggered into the Shelley under the weight of suitcases, diaper bags, strollers and collapsible baby beds, piling them alongside the hotel bar, where a glossy international crowd sipped free drinks (another Shelley perk, from 7 to 8 nightly). Then, as if we had stumbled upon a semitropical knockoff of \u201cCheers,\u201d the crowd shouted to the new arrivals, \u201cHappy Hour!\u201d This isn\u2019t so bad, I thought, ordering a rum and tonic in a tiny plastic cup. And it wasn\u2019t. Our room was clean and quiet and, exhausted from a long day, our 9-month-old, Roxie, slept through the night.For years, I had fantasized about a camper van and taking a weeklong road trip through the Florida Keys. After Roxie was born last summer, a camper seemed like the ideal introductory family vacation. With the van doubling as accommodations and transportation, we could camp our way down the Overseas Highway on a relatively modest budget without the hassle of hauling our camping gear cross-country.The Escape Campervans office, hidden in a fountain courtyard, was a closet-size room stacked with camping gear and staffed by an affable South African expat named Leon. Nothing if not thorough, he spent an hour introducing us to our home for the week: \u201cTopiary,\u201d a converted Ford Econoline utility van painted in impressionistic multigreen foliage. Then he equipped us with maps and brochures, and offered recommendations for our Florida Keys road trip.When our site turned out to be a shadeless gravel pad with a view of a wooden fence and the large concrete block structure housing bathrooms, I needed to redeem the day. I had fantasized about an oceanfront campsite, but I would settle for a cold beer and 30-cent peel-and-eat shrimp, which we found at Sparky\u2019s Landing, an over-the-water bar, where locals watched sports and tourists gawked at manatees on the deck. (We, sadly, missed a sea cow sighting by minutes.)My hopes for the trip resurrected, we stopped at Publix, the Florida-based grocery chain, where we stocked up on good-quality prepared dishes and salads from the deli section before returning to camp. But instead of heading straight for our site, we drove to the park\u2019s beach, where we sat at a picnic table watching dusk settle over the Atlantic. The palms pattered overhead and Roxie, a wide giddy smile across her tiny face, leaned into the warm wind, which smelled sweet and funky from decaying seaweed, as boat motors buzzed on the horizon.The next morning, I walked through the park and realized how pleasant it actually was. With my expectations adjusted, I noticed the comfortable space between the sites, which were surrounded by shrubby buttonwood trees, bay bean vines and lantana. Still, we didn\u2019t linger. We hit the beach, where we waded out into the shallow, pale blue water for Roxie\u2019s first dip into the ocean. My husband, Tim, and I passed her back and forth as she shrieked in wild, unrestrained excitement. She splashed and giggled, acting out the joy I feel every time I leap into warm, salty sea. From her enthusiasm, any remnant of my initial disappointment disappeared. I was all in.Thankfully, the rest of Big Pine Key\u2019s fauna was charming. There were aggressively friendly toy-size Key deer, which begged for picnic table scraps, and a regal great white heron that held court for hours. Fuchsia-legged ibis scampered at the waterline while cream-colored doves and brown pelicans flew in dance-troupe formation overhead. Then there were our fellow campers, who strolled the grounds at sunset, topped-off glasses of wine in hand.Our last couple of days in the Keys, Tim and I were groggy from being awakened by Roxie, who slept beside us in a bed-top travel bassinet. But we weren\u2019t any more tired than our new normal as parents of an infant. Fortunately, the things to do at Bahia Honda didn\u2019t require much of us. Our site, tucked into the foliage at the northern end of the park, was secluded. A sandy path led to a long beach and, for two days, we did little but swim in the ocean, which was everything I had fantasized about during the months leading up to our trip.It looked like a glass marble threaded with shimmering blues and greens, and had gentle, baby-size waves. At dusk, the dolphins swam past in a tight pod. The sky was deep black and the stars were silver spurs. After Roxie fell asleep, Tim and I played music on our iPhones, the volume low, and slow-danced like honeymooners. The trip hadn\u2019t been as carefree as our prebaby travels, but nine months into parenthood, we were finding our rhythm.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Time Warner Deal Gives Hulu a Much-Needed $580 Million Lift", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsTime Warner\u2019s willingness to serve as sous-chef in Hulu\u2019s crowded kitchen could keep the broth from spoiling.Hulu, the digital TV service, will get $580 million from Time Warner, the American media conglomerate, and fresh programs from its TNT and CNN networks. Notably, however, Time Warner will hold a smaller stake in Hulu than other major investors and refrain from joining a board already crowded by rivals like Walt Disney, 21st Century Fox and Comcast.Hulu has charted a rocky path since it was started in 2007. Owners clashed over competing ideas and agendas, including trying to protect lucrative fees collected by cable operators to carry their networks. Twice, the service has been put up for sale. A private equity backer sold out. Comcast\u2019s involvement was hamstrung by regulators as part of its acquisition of NBC Universal. Along the way, Hulu lost its highly regarded chief executive.Despite the turmoil, Hulu has benefited from consumers who are increasingly watching TV shows and movies when they want and on devices of their choosing. Hulu has quadrupled the number of paying customers in four years to 12 million, pulling in at least $1.2 billion from those on the lowest plan at $8 a month. That does not include advertising revenue, which Credit Suisse estimates will be $850 million this year.Time Warner\u2019s 10 percent stake, at a $5.8 billion valuation for Hulu, precedes a planned introduction of Hulu\u2019s live-streaming service next year. That feature will distinguish it from rivals like Amazon and Netflix, which trades at a higher multiple of sales than Hulu does based on its new investment. For now, only shows from the Turner networks will be available, though there are discussions about adding ones from Time Warner\u2019s HBO, home to the hit \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201dHulu will pay Time Warner for the shows, in much the same way that traditional cable companies pay fees to Time Warner. In that sense, at least some of the money from Time Warner will boomerang back to it. Jeffrey Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, emphasized on Wednesday that his company\u2019s investment would give Hulu more programming firepower. Doing so without muscling in too much on the operations may give the joint venture a better shot at success.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.E., the 124-Year-Old Software Start-Up", "Date": "2016-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt may not qualify as a lightning-bolt eureka moment, but Jeffrey R. Immelt, chief executive of General Electric, recalls the June day in 2009 that got him thinking. He was speaking with G.E. scientists about new jet engines they were building, laden with sensors to generate a trove of data from every flight \u2014 but to what end?That data could someday be as valuable as the machinery itself, if not more so. But G.E. couldn\u2019t make use of it.But in 2011, G.E. also quietly opened a software center in San Ramon, Calif., 24 miles east of San Francisco, across the bay.Today one of San Ramon\u2019s most important projects is to build a computer operating system, but on an industrial scale \u2014 a Microsoft Windows or Google Android for factories and industrial equipment. The project is central to G.E.\u2019s drive to become what Mr. Immelt says will be a \u201ctop 10 software company\u201d by 2020.Silicon Valley veterans are skeptical.Many industries see digital threats, of course. Yet the scope of the challenge is magnified at G.E., a 124-year-old company and the nation\u2019s largest manufacturer, with more than 300,000 employees worldwide. Employees companywide have been making pilgrimages to San Ramon for technology briefings, but also to soak in the culture. Their marching orders are to try to adapt the digital wizardry and hurry-up habits of Silicon Valley to G.E.\u2019s world of industrial manufacturing.6 PhotosG.E.\u2019s success or failure over the next decade, Mr. Immelt says, depends on this transformation. He calls it \u201cprobably the most important thing I\u2019ve worked on in my career.\u201dApparently, there is no Plan B. \u201cIt\u2019s this or bust,\u201d he said.The march of digital technology \u2014 mainly inexpensive sensors, powerful computing and clever software \u2014 into the industrial world has been underway for years under the guise of \u201cthe internet of things\u201d or \u201cthe industrial internet.\u201d It is the next battlefield as companies fight to develop the dominant software layer that connects the machines.It promises to be a huge market for new products, improved service and efficiency gains in industries like energy, transportation and health care. By 2020, the industrial internet market will reach $225 billion, G.E. executives predicted in a recent meeting with analysts.So far, a major application has been predictive maintenance. Software analyzes the data generated by a machine to identify early warning signals that it needs repair, before it breaks down.The data volumes are exploding as machines new and old spawn sensors. By 2020, G.E. estimates that the data flowing off its machines in use will jump a hundredfold. That should enable far more detailed analysis, giving G.E. a chance to sell its customers not machines but \u201cbusiness outcomes,\u201d like fuel savings. Mr. Immelt sees this as a move up the industrial food chain.Yet all of this exposes G.E. to new competition beyond its traditional rivals like Rockwell Automation, Siemens and United Technologies. Tech giants, including Amazon, Cisco, Google, IBM and Microsoft also have their eye on the industrial internet market, as do a bevy of start-ups.There is precedent for trouble in other industries, of course. Google and Facebook transformed media and advertising, Amazon redefined retailing, and Uber applied an entirely new business model to taxis, which hadn\u2019t changed much in generations.\u201cThe real danger is that the data and analysis becomes worth more than the installed equipment itself,\u201d said Karim R. Lakhani, a professor at the Harvard Business School. \u201cG.E. has no choice but to try to do that itself.\u201dUntil this year, Darren Haas hadn\u2019t thought about G.E., certainly not working there. To him, G.E. meant little more than than kitchen appliances and light bulbs. \u201cI had no idea,\u201d Mr. Haas said.But he was intrigued after he met with Harel Kodesh, an expert in mobile and cloud computing who led teams at Microsoft and VMware, a maker of data-center software. Less than two years ago, Mr. Kodesh joined G.E., and he is now chief technology officer of GE Digital.That someone of Mr. Kodesh\u2019s caliber was a G.E. convert got Mr. Haas\u2019s attention. Then, Mr. Haas started grasping the role that G.E. equipment plays across the economy \u2014 in transportation, in hospitals \u2014 \u201ca whole world,\u201d he said. \u201cI found that really, really compelling.\u201dThe other thing Mr. Haas, 41, found appealing was the big computing challenge that lies ahead for the company. In May, he joined G.E. from Apple, where he was a member of the founding team at Siri, the voice-based digital assistant start-up Apple acquired in 2010. When he left Apple, Mr. Haas was head of cloud engineering, managing the computing engine behind Siri, iTunes and iCloud.At GE Digital, Mr. Haas has a similar title, head of platform cloud engineering, but in a different setting. He describes his job as applying modern software technology \u2014 machine learning, artificial intelligence and cloud computing \u2014 to the industrial arena. \u201cI\u2019ve got my work cut out for me,\u201d he said.Mr. Haas is working on the centerpiece of G.E.\u2019s software strategy, a product called Predix. Its evolution mirrors G.E.\u2019s software ambitions.Predix began as little more than a brand of software used by G.E. to service the gear it sells. One showcase use was in jet engines to do predictive maintenance, saving downtime. Around 2013, William Ruh, a former Cisco Systems executive brought in to put together the San Ramon software center, started expanding Predix to other G.E. industrial businesses.But that soon felt too small. The issue was \u201coutside disrupters,\u201d Mr. Ruh said, citing the online lodging start-up Airbnb as an example of rivals that can appear seemingly out of nowhere and that \u201cbring greater productivity \u2014 but don\u2019t own the assets they sell.\u201d G.E., Mr. Ruh notes, is the ultimate big-asset company.The other threat was rising interest among tech companies to take their internet connectivity expertise and try to apply it to industrial businesses. To get ahead of all this, G.E. reimagined Predix as a cloud-based operating system for industrial applications.Mr. Kodesh leads that effort. He ticks off the looming competitors: Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and others. \u201cThose companies are going to encroach on the territory,\u201d Mr. Kodesh said. \u201cAre we going to capitulate, or build something like Predix?\u201dThe basic idea is that G.E. and outside software developers will write programs to run on Predix. This software might, for instance, monitor the health and fine-tune the operation of equipment like oil-field rigs and wind-farm turbines, improving performance, reducing wear and adapting to changing environmental conditions. It amounts to software delivering the equivalent of personalized medicine for machines.Like any other computer operating system, Predix aims to take the complexity out of writing programs, so more people can create them. And while the instincts of the industrial world are proprietary, G.E. is following an open-source model with Predix, providing a basic design, but one open to outside contributors \u2014 more like Android from Google than Windows from Microsoft.Predix, Mr. Kodesh said, will be improved using the software equivalent of Lego blocks. \u201cSome will be G.E.\u2019s, and some will be made by third-party developers,\u201d he said.G.E. is betting that its deep knowledge of industry will give it an edge in this software arms race. The stakes for this kind of programming can be high.For a regular consumer using the internet, a misfiring algorithm in the software \u2014 \u201ca false positive\u201d \u2014 might mean a person sees an irrelevant online ad, or a bad Amazon book suggestion or Netflix movie recommendation, Mr. Kodesh said. Useless, perhaps, but not necessarily costly. But a false positive that prompts an airline to take a jet engine off the wing, Mr. Kodesh said, is a $100,000 mistake.\u201cWe really do need to have different technology, different algorithms and a different cloud, than in the consumer internet,\u201d he said.G.E. has set an ambitious target for Predix. It hopes to attract $100 million in orders this year, on its way to $4 billion in revenue by 2020. By then, the company forecasts that its total digital business \u2014 more than 90 percent of it software \u2014 may reach as much as $15 billion, up from $6 billion now.For Predix to reach its potential, though, G.E. needs outside programmers to write software for it. The company, with its deep pockets, can start the software-writing parade, but will others follow?This will be a major test. And G.E.\u2019s campaign to build an industrial operating system and create a flourishing ecosystem of software for it is just getting underway in earnest.In late July, G.E. hosted a Predix conference in Las Vegas, which attracted 1,200 software developers. Such developer gatherings are part of the playbook of every major software company but unusual for an industrial corporation.G.E. has some built-in advantages. Its installed base is huge. For example, the company says more than a third of the world\u2019s electricity is generated on G.E. equipment. It can make progress simply by winning over the aircraft makers, oil companies, hospitals and utilities that now depend on G.E. machinery.G.E. is starting to attract a developer following. Tata Consultancy Services, for one, says it now has 500 programmers designing and developing Predix applications for customers in the electric-utility, aviation and health care industries. G.E. also promotes partnerships with Infosys, Wipro and Capgemini to help business write Predix software.When he joined in 2011, Mr. Ruh had no illusions that making software a strength at a heavy-industry company would be easy. At the time, he told Mr. Immelt that would be \u201ca 10-year journey,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of that journey.\u201dPart of that is an effort to change an engineering culture that stretches back generations. \u201cIf G.E. is truly going to be a digital-industrial company, we can\u2019t be separate here,\u201d Mr. Ruh said of his software division. Digital \u201ctools and habits\u201d need to be embedded \u201cin how people do their jobs,\u201d he said.In its factory in Greenville, S.C., G.E. produces both giant power generators and evidence that this metamorphosis might work.The three-story building is crowded with immense cranes and milling, grinding and welding machines, overseen by manufacturing engineers and technicians. The finishing touches are being put on one of G.E.\u2019s new gas turbines.It looks like the business end of a rocket ship lying on its side, a gleaming steel dynamo at rest. It weighs 950,000 pounds. It fires up at nearly 2,900 degrees Fahrenheit, and it can generate enough electricity to supply more than 500,000 households.The gas turbine was brought to market in half the typical five years. That kind of accelerated product development is a performance that G.E. hopes to replicate across its industrial businesses. And it is a story of changes in design and manufacturing practices made possible by digital technology.John Lammas, the 56-year-old vice president for power generation engineering, started his working career 40 years ago, on the shop floor of a Rolls-Royce jet engine factory in Birmingham, England. He has been with G.E. for 31 years, moving up the ranks of the company\u2019s jet engine and power turbine divisions.\u201cI\u2019m an old mechanical guy,\u201d he said. But a couple of years ago, he issued an edict: no more paper drawings.In the past, a model of a new part would be made and then converted to detailed blueprints running to 70 pages or more. These would then be physically sent to G.E. manufacturing engineers and outside suppliers to begin setting up the tooling, casting and cutting for the part.This prototype-and-blueprint routine took up to eight weeks. Now, engineers use 3-D computer models, skip the prototype step and instantly send the models electronically.This goes a step beyond computer-aided design, which is commonplace. In Greenville, the designers are for the first time linked directly with manufacturers and suppliers in real time, in what G.E. calls a \u201cdigital thread.\u201d This means they can collaborate in ways that have changed the work process while making it more likely that problems or defects are spotted sooner.Traditionally, one set of engineers designed a part, and only then passed it on to manufacturing. If a problem arose on the supplier side, the design was kicked back and the process started over. \u201cJobs are combining in this digital world,\u201d Mr. Lammas said.Greenville\u2019s own equipment has been a Predix guinea pig. The machinery and factory were retrofitted with data-generating sensors and the software. Matt Krause, the plant manager, said that last winter, when a snowstorm shut the factory for a day, the sensor network detected that the plant had consumed 1,000 pounds of argon, an inert gas used in coatings for parts. The leak was fixed, saving $350,000 a year.\u201cWe can see things we never did before,\u201d Mr. Krause said. Over all, 60 of 200 steps in design and production have been automated or eliminated, reducing work time by 530,000 hours over three years, G.E. estimates.Not all the start-up ideas that G.E. is trying to breed translate comfortably to heavy industry. Lean proponents urge companies to come up with \u201cminimum viable products,\u201d particularly test versions of software programs. But no one wants a minimum viable jet engine or power generator.Yet in Greenville, engineers in the design stages are encouraged to move faster in smaller steps, conduct more experiments, and be willing to fail and try again. It amounts to a sea change in the engineering culture of heavy industry.\u201cAs an engineer, not getting it right the first time, I find painful,\u201d said Bill Byrne, an engineering manager. \u201cIt\u2019s uncomfortable. But it\u2019s been incredibly liberating.\u201dThe old ways, said Mr. Lammas, the engineering chief, had merit. Each step and rule was logical on its own. But the emphasis on flawless execution and perfection fostered a fear of failure. \u201cOvercoming that culture was probably the biggest challenge,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: Fanciful Classic \u2018The Little Prince\u2019 Is Turned Into Modernist Fable", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "Supported byThe main character, the unnamed Little Girl (voiced by Mackenzie Foy), who is about to turn 9, is relentlessly pushed by her fiercely controlling mother (Rachel McAdams) to gain admission to a snooty school and spend all her spare time studying. The poor child is overscheduled within an inch of her life: A calendar charts her existence down to the millisecond.A respite from the mental discipline arrives when she meets their next-door neighbor, the Aviator (Jeff Bridges), after a propeller flies off his backyard airplane and onto their property. With his magician\u2019s beard and old-coot drawl, he is a kindly, eccentric, wise man. Climbing through the hole in the fence separating their houses, the Little Girl begins a clandestine, through-the-looking-glass friendship with this dreamer, who tells her of his aeronautical adventures of decades past. At this point, the stop-motion animation enters the movie. Mr. Bridges, affecting a grandfatherly voice, gives the film a steady, warm emotional glow.Even at its most endearing, the Saint-Exup\u00e9ry story is far from the kind of smugly reassuring children\u2019s fable manufactured by Hollywood nowadays. The Aviator entrances the Little Girl with the story of the Little Prince, a boy from a distant asteroid whom he encountered in the Sahara after his plane crashed.Among the many interplanetary travels that eventually landed the Little Prince on Earth, the most emotional involves his fraught romance with a vain, high-strung rose, which drove him to leave the asteroid. When the Little Girl meets him, he\u2019s no longer the Little Prince, but a janitor who has forgotten his childhood. She leads him on a galactic quest to find the rose he left behind.For all its magic and imaginative flair, the story of \u201cThe Little Prince\u201d is not especially happy, although the screenplay, by Irena Brignull and Bob Persichetti, puts as euphoric a spin as possible on events. That tale, unlike the modern shell into which it\u2019s been nestled, is deliberately flighty (if you\u2019ll excuse the pun). It involves the pain of abandoning childhood dreams, growing up and accepting mortality.But the film, as if wary of seeming too spaced-out, devotes more time than necessary to its contemporary frame and not enough to the original story. That said, the framing delivers an unusually forceful and imaginative depiction of a child\u2019s-eye vision of the grown-up world: a fearsome urban jungle peopled by expressionless, robotic beings weighed down by responsibility.Although the message of the novella \u2014 that \u201cit is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye\u201d \u2014 is reiterated, the film\u2019s caricature of the digital age atmosphere is so forbidding that it makes the charming fancies of \u201cThe Little Prince\u201d seem quaint and frivolous. The movie, a Netflix release receiving a theatrical run, can even be seen as an allegory about filmmaking in today (by a director of \u201cKung Fu Panda\u201d), straddling the line between modern and traditional styles and blending the best of both. Inevitably, youth, vigor and technological innovation triumph over nostalgia.\u201cThe Little Prince\u201d is rated PG (parental guidance suggested) for thematic elements that portray modern life as a nightmare that cannot be avoided.

I look around at my city, and I think that\u2019s ridiculous.\u201dMr. Allen said he hoped the show involved play on a more \u201cnarrative-moral level,\u201d in which players are protagonists beyond just the created world.\u201cI don\u2019t know how often somebody leaves the game thinking about Chicago violence,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they\u2019ll leave thinking about weapons and escalation and the idea that more weapons don\u2019t make anybody safe.\u201dIn the game Cards Against Humanity, a raunchy riff on Apples to Apples, players match question-and-answer cards to come up with humorously offensive combinations.Angie McMahon, the director of \u201cHorrible Fun,\u201d said Cards Against Humanity matches well with improv because it keeps the audience from feeling the need to be funny.\u201cThe audience is protected because the jokes have been pre-written for them,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to think of something funny. They can say the combination is funny, and it gives them a premise to an improv scene.\u201dAlthough the show is advertised as \u201cdirty, ridiculous, offensive and horrible,\u201d its keener improvisers know that going gross goes only so far. Ms. McMahon\u2019s advice? \u201cThe cards are dirty enough, so let\u2019s play smart,\u201d she said.\u201cWhen I started seeing the two together, I thought about rules,\u201d Mr. Ooi said. \u201cIn the game, there are rules about how the world works and what you can and can\u2019t do, and how you figure out how a character succeeds or fails. In dating there are rules, too, but the rules of Dungeons & Dragons are concrete. You can fudge them here and there, but the rules of dating are all over the place.\u201dUnlike its interactive peers, \u201cDating and Dragons\u201d is a traditional stage play. An avid gamer named Jack falls for a woman but is stymied by his inability to master the rules of dating. Avatars, including a barbaric orc with an ax and a cloaked shape-shifter act out the role-playing games played by the stage characters.For Mr. Ooi, the parallels between Dungeons & Dragons and theater come down to a fondness for shared storytelling.\u201cIn a play, you have someone write, and you all agree on a set of rules to construct a world, including the audience, and what the rules are,\u201d he said. \u201cWith D&D, it\u2019s the same thing. You get a master who\u2019s like the author, and you have players and they are the actors. The dungeon master either creates a world or presents one to the players, and they create the story together.\u201d\u201cI was worried that it might be too gamey, like a game show,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it works as theater in that you bring in all the religious comedy, about concepts of heaven and hell and who\u2019s there. When you start to get people to talk about it, that\u2019s when the theatricality comes out. It becomes an experience.\u201dAny fears died quickly once a certain group started attending.\u201cNuns love bingo and religion and the prizes,\u201d Ms. Quade said. \u201cWhen I go to the door and say goodbye to the audience, I go back to my desk and all my holy cards are gone.\u201d\u201cYou start rooting for your numbers, and it becomes competitive,\u201d said Mr. Collins, the managing director of Actors Theater in St. Paul, where the show originated in 2005. \u201cThe psychology is perfect.\u201dIrish and Italian sensibilities permeate \u201cWe Gotta Bingo,\u201d which calls to mind the broad ethnic humor played interactively in \u201cTony n\u2019 Tina\u2019s Wedding.\u201d Like the shared experience of a wedding, Mr. Collins said bingo is \u201cpretty universal,\u201d a reason his show draws more than just Catholics with memories of parish fund-raisers.

It even included a free airport shuttle to the hotel\u2019s South Beach address, walking distance from where we would pick up our camper van rental the next morning before making a beeline for the Florida Keys. When the shuttle arrived, it was impossible to miss. Wrapped in a wheels-to-roof vinyl ad, the bus was a mobile billboard splashed with the racy, larger-than-life image of a buxom woman \u2014 her blond hair thrown back, her face flushed \u2014 being caressed by a masked man, red silk around his neck. Next to the door was a slogan: \u201cQuirky + Sexy + Chic No-Tell Hotels.\u201d My husband, infant daughter and I climbed aboard. I had, it seemed, booked my family at what in Mexico is artfully referred to as a \u201clove motel.\u201d Well, I thought, no \u201cMom of the Year\u201d award for me.We staggered into the Shelley under the weight of suitcases, diaper bags, strollers and collapsible baby beds, piling them alongside the hotel bar, where a glossy international crowd sipped free drinks (another Shelley perk, from 7 to 8 nightly). Then, as if we had stumbled upon a semitropical knockoff of \u201cCheers,\u201d the crowd shouted to the new arrivals, \u201cHappy Hour!\u201d This isn\u2019t so bad, I thought, ordering a rum and tonic in a tiny plastic cup. And it wasn\u2019t. Our room was clean and quiet and, exhausted from a long day, our 9-month-old, Roxie, slept through the night.For years, I had fantasized about a camper van and taking a weeklong road trip through the Florida Keys. After Roxie was born last summer, a camper seemed like the ideal introductory family vacation. With the van doubling as accommodations and transportation, we could camp our way down the Overseas Highway on a relatively modest budget without the hassle of hauling our camping gear cross-country.The Escape Campervans office, hidden in a fountain courtyard, was a closet-size room stacked with camping gear and staffed by an affable South African expat named Leon. Nothing if not thorough, he spent an hour introducing us to our home for the week: \u201cTopiary,\u201d a converted Ford Econoline utility van painted in impressionistic multigreen foliage. Then he equipped us with maps and brochures, and offered recommendations for our Florida Keys road trip.When our site turned out to be a shadeless gravel pad with a view of a wooden fence and the large concrete block structure housing bathrooms, I needed to redeem the day. I had fantasized about an oceanfront campsite, but I would settle for a cold beer and 30-cent peel-and-eat shrimp, which we found at Sparky\u2019s Landing, an over-the-water bar, where locals watched sports and tourists gawked at manatees on the deck. (We, sadly, missed a sea cow sighting by minutes.)My hopes for the trip resurrected, we stopped at Publix, the Florida-based grocery chain, where we stocked up on good-quality prepared dishes and salads from the deli section before returning to camp. But instead of heading straight for our site, we drove to the park\u2019s beach, where we sat at a picnic table watching dusk settle over the Atlantic. The palms pattered overhead and Roxie, a wide giddy smile across her tiny face, leaned into the warm wind, which smelled sweet and funky from decaying seaweed, as boat motors buzzed on the horizon.The next morning, I walked through the park and realized how pleasant it actually was. With my expectations adjusted, I noticed the comfortable space between the sites, which were surrounded by shrubby buttonwood trees, bay bean vines and lantana. Still, we didn\u2019t linger. We hit the beach, where we waded out into the shallow, pale blue water for Roxie\u2019s first dip into the ocean. My husband, Tim, and I passed her back and forth as she shrieked in wild, unrestrained excitement. She splashed and giggled, acting out the joy I feel every time I leap into warm, salty sea. From her enthusiasm, any remnant of my initial disappointment disappeared. I was all in.Thankfully, the rest of Big Pine Key\u2019s fauna was charming. There were aggressively friendly toy-size Key deer, which begged for picnic table scraps, and a regal great white heron that held court for hours. Fuchsia-legged ibis scampered at the waterline while cream-colored doves and brown pelicans flew in dance-troupe formation overhead. Then there were our fellow campers, who strolled the grounds at sunset, topped-off glasses of wine in hand.Our last couple of days in the Keys, Tim and I were groggy from being awakened by Roxie, who slept beside us in a bed-top travel bassinet. But we weren\u2019t any more tired than our new normal as parents of an infant. Fortunately, the things to do at Bahia Honda didn\u2019t require much of us. Our site, tucked into the foliage at the northern end of the park, was secluded. A sandy path led to a long beach and, for two days, we did little but swim in the ocean, which was everything I had fantasized about during the months leading up to our trip.It looked like a glass marble threaded with shimmering blues and greens, and had gentle, baby-size waves. At dusk, the dolphins swam past in a tight pod. The sky was deep black and the stars were silver spurs. After Roxie fell asleep, Tim and I played music on our iPhones, the volume low, and slow-danced like honeymooners. The trip hadn\u2019t been as carefree as our prebaby travels, but nine months into parenthood, we were finding our rhythm.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Baz Luhrmann\u2019s \u2018The Get Down\u2019 Is \u2018West Side Story\u2019 With Rappers and Disco Queens", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "Supported byIn the 90-minute premiere episode, which Mr. Luhrmann directed (and, with Seth Zvi Rosenfeld and the playwright Stephen Adly Guirgis, wrote), the result is relatively painless, even entertaining. The colors are bright and glossy, the camerawork fluid, the editing smooth, the cast endearing. The soundtrack is propulsive but unsurprising, familiar hits by the Spinners; Donna Summer; Earth, Wind & Fire; and the Trammps.Even on this smaller scale, though, and working with a team that includes Mr. Guirgis as his co-creator, Mr. Luhrmann has the same old problem. He\u2019s less interested in plot and character than in orchestrating big emotions the way the great Hollywood musicals did. Which leads to a Catch-22: He can get us excited with his manipulations of image and music, but he doesn\u2019t create people or stories interesting enough to give those feelings any focus.That can leave talented performers high and dry, and \u201cThe Get Down\u201d is a catalog of good actors struggling to bring some life to stock characters. Giancarlo Esposito and Jimmy Smits play brothers, an indignant fire-and-brimstone preacher and a wearily corrupt local politician, and both actors seem straitjacketed. Ron Cephas Jones manages to make something funny out of his small role as a cosmic jazz man, but Lillias White can\u2019t do much with one of the show\u2019s oddest contrivances, a flapper-style drug boss who seems to have stepped straight out of the Cotton Club.The young, lesser known performers at the center of the story fare better, though their parts are just as hackneyed. Herizen F. Guardiola has an endearing, believable combination of sass and modesty as Mylene, the minister\u2019s daughter who wants to become a disco star. Justice Smith and Shameik Moore are fine, if not revelatory, in the lead roles of Ezekiel and Shaolin Fantastic, the nascent M.C. and D.J. whose combustible relationship forms the show\u2019s primary plotline. The best thing in many scenes is the comic relief provided by Skylan Brooks and Tremaine Brown Jr. as brothers who serve as a protective posse for Ezekiel.Of the six episodes now being released, Mr. Luhrmann \u2014 who supervised the entire production \u2014 directed only the first, and after the premiere the tone and style shift significantly. The storytelling takes on more of the quality of a midlevel sitcom, or the \u201970s and \u201980s films of Michael Schultz (\u201cCar Wash,\u201d \u201cThe Last Dragon\u201d), and the big moments become increasingly maudlin. For worse and for better, \u201cThe Get Down\u201d probably should have just been a Baz Luhrmann film.Advertisement"}

The graphic design and music are several levels above those of the cable reality series in this genre. Much of the series was shot in Brazil, which supplies riders to P.B.R. the way the Dominican Republic supplies shortstops to Major League Baseball, and the Brazilian unit captures misty, idyllic images of the ranches where the self-described cowboys train.There isn\u2019t quite enough content to fill those four hours, though. The wary but amicable relationship between American and Brazilian riders provides some diversion. Yet the competitions, including the season championship, aren\u2019t terribly dramatic, except for the somber moments when paramedics have to be called into the ring. And most of the time is spent in endless discussions of why a man would devote his days to climbing on the back of a 1,500-pound bull that\u2019s bred to buck, and trying to stay on it for eight seconds, over and over again. Is it the golden champion\u2019s buckle? Is it the million-dollar grand prize? After the first hour, you don\u2019t care anymore.But \u201cFearless\u201d has one great ace up its sleeve. Nothing looks quite like the slow-motion footage of those eight-second (or shorter) rides. The riders become rag dolls, their bodies jerking and folding in seemingly impossible ways. Often there\u2019s the grisly bonus of seeing them fly off the bulls\u2019 backs and desperately try to avoid their jackhammering hooves. Watching that mayhem in the classy surroundings of \u201cFearless\u201d feels less dirty than looking up \u201cbull riding accidents\u201d on YouTube.A television review on Friday about the new Netflix documentary series, \u201cFearless,\u201d misidentified Sean Gleason\u2019s role in the making of the show.

Mr. Suri, who was born in that borough to Punjabi parents, offered to show him around, even introducing the actor to his family. \u201cMy dad drove a cab, so that kind of made sense,\u201d Mr. Suri said.But a funny thing happened before they could release their debut album: Mr. Ahmed, 33, got much more famous as an actor.Lyrically, Mr. Ahmed and Mr. Suri puncture current events and geopolitical preoccupations with a tart satirical edge and an emphasis on identity, especially the portrayal and perceptions of brown men like themselves \u2014 in politics, pop music, Hollywood, airports and beyond.Mr. Ahmed grew up in London, idolizing American rappers from his older brother\u2019s early 1990s cassettes (the D.O.C., Tupac Shakur) before immersing himself in underground British rave culture, rap battles and pirate radio. He also graduated from Oxford University and the Central School for Speech and Drama.\u201cThere\u2019s a saying: You wait three hours for a London bus, and then three of them come all at once,\u201d Mr. Ahmed said of his heightened profile in each realm. \u201cPeople that didn\u2019t know I was an actor were going, \u2018Riz MC is in \u201cBourne!\u201d\u2019 And people that didn\u2019t know I did music are going, \u2018The dude from \u201cNightcrawler\u201d did this \u201cEnglistan\u201d thing!\u2019\u201dHe added: \u201cWe live in a world where people build up cultural capital in one field and then cash it in across others. I\u2019m proud to say that\u2019s really not me.\u201dMr. Ahmed also laughed off any suggestion that his firebrand rap persona could present a conflict with his role in the Disney-owned, billion-dollar \u201cStar Wars\u201d universe, mocking the idea of a cigar-chomping movie executive\u2019s even acknowledging his music.Swet Shop Boys is less a side project than a parallel one for Mr. Ahmed, with both parts of his career serving a similar purpose in increasing representation for South Asians in culture. \u201cFigureheads don\u2019t solve systemic racism or structural problems, but it helps with aspiration,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to feel visible.\u201dIn working together, Mr. Ahmed and Mr. Suri found kinship, but with enough divergence to be educational. \u201cThere\u2019s this whole parallel reality where there\u2019s people just like you, but with subtly different gifts and curses to their experience,\u201d Mr. Ahmed said of his American counterpart. \u201cJoining those diasporic dots is just really healing.\u201dIn the studio, the pair even found their disparate creative methods to be coming from a similar place of first-generation angst. \u201cThere\u2019s the working-class immigrant in me thinking, \u2018This is not a real job, so I\u2019ve got to make it as complicated as possible,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Ahmed, who obsessively tweaks his rapid verses.Mr. Suri is more prone to trust-your-gut improvisation. \u201cI go the other route: \u2018I should be working a desk job, so let me just get this thing over as quickly as I can,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have to think about the fact that I\u2019m an aaar-tist.\u201dAfter all, he added, \u201cWhat kind of kid from my neighborhood becomes an artist?\u201dAdvertisement"}

Will she like spicy South Asian food or will I have to shame myself by ordering \u201cmild\u201d? Will my American Muslim daughter be allowed to leave the Trump detention camps if she grows up to be a \u201c10\u201d? Would that make her eligible for a Trump Beauty Pageant?I didn\u2019t live in fear growing up in Fremont, Calif., in the 1980s and 1990s. Like the Khans, my parents are Muslim immigrants originally from Pakistan. My parents didn\u2019t keep their own copy of the Constitution in their pockets, but they were known to bust out Mervyn\u2019s coupons and exquisite daal recipes on command. Islam was a vibrant reality for us, comfortably embedded within memories of watching Thundercats cartoons on Saturdays, listening to Dad\u2019s Jimi Hendrix CDs and seeing my mother\u2019s sari collection.I have now been transformed into a professional adult in his 30s, just like my parents were when they had me. Their generation was forged from immigrant steel and clarified butter. They built mosques out of abandoned shops, drove two states away to find halal meat, started American Muslim institutions, worked full time, raised kids, taught us the Quran and found time to make lamb biryani for an extended family of 12 living in a two-bedroom apartment.I am not doing that. I can barely catch up on my Netflix shows. But I still want my children to know the rich cultural and religious traditions given to me \u2014 traditions that I took for granted.In recent conversations with about a dozen other American Muslim friends and parents, I found a lot of agreement on the challenge we\u2019re facing: Our kids will know a kind of anti-Muslim bigotry that we never did. At the same time, there\u2019s also a healthy debate on how to raise practicing Muslim children here.Hina Khan-Mukhtar, a mother of three in the Bay Area, said the only way is for us to transform into \u201cSuper-Muslims,\u201d minus the cape. \u201cIn America, you can\u2019t be a mediocre Muslim,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to be the best of the best, and you have to show your kids that you have a \u2018superior product\u2019 that you are offering them. There are so many \u2018-isms\u2019 calling for their attention and for their loyalty \u2014 individualism, atheism, materialism, extremism. Islam needs to trump them all.\u201dUnfortunately for my children, I excel in mediocrity. This Ramadan, I opened my fasts at home with a date and some takeout food. I usually prayed Maghrib, the evening prayer, by myself in the family room. My wife, a full-time doctor, supermom and pregnant with our second child at the time, did her best to join me, but her schedule left her exhausted.I felt guilty that my son, who is about to turn 2, was experiencing the most broke Ramadan ever. I wanted to give him the 2016 version of what I had growing up when my mother, grandmother, cousins and I would assemble in the kitchen and prepare the pakoras, samosas and fruit chaat of the Ramadan iftar meal. My father would come home and lead us in prayer. On the weekends, we\u2019d host \u201cmilad\u201d parties with people reciting poetry in praise of the Prophet Muhammad.One potential route in producing \u201csuperior Muslims\u201d is to follow the model of Orthodox Jewish Americans and invest tremendous resources and time to create enclosed schools or home schooling co-ops for our communities.This environment might protect kids from bullying or the task of being a professional Muslim. I went to an all-boys Catholic high school, and I was often asked to be the cultural ambassador of 1.6 billion people, to explain head scarves and fasting. Even though I had to be a walking Wikipedia, it encouraged me to be more bold with my Muslim identity.Army Major Jason Moy, my old law school roommate, is skeptical of Muslim-only environments. \u201cComplete isolation is never a winning strategy,\u201d he told me. \u201cI am a firm believer in allowing our children to be completely involved in American culture, holidays and food.\u201dThankfully, American Muslim kids can find halal hot dogs at their local mosques, which have doubled in number since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, a sign that despite the rising bigotry, Muslims communities are able to thrive in America.I have never been culturally, spiritually or intellectually fulfilled by most of my neighborhood mosques, especially as many still relegate women to side entrances. They tried their best and have evolved considerably, but the hodgepodge blend of Salafism, Deobandi Islam and traces of watered-down Sufism that I usually encountered didn\u2019t move my soul.For this reason, my family and I are spiritual nomads, not tied to any particular institution.We live not too far away and we took my son, Ibrahim, there for Eid prayers recently. He wore his kurta and ran around the hall as the young imam preached about tolerance and requested donations so the worshipers could purchase their own space and finally leave the rented space in an Afghan restaurant.We\u2019re trying to retain so much of the good we inherited from our parents, throw away the rotten parts and improvise along the way. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to start from scratch,\u201d said Willow Wilson, who writes the \u201cMs. Marvel\u201d comic book series, which stars a teenage Muslim superhero. \u201cIn my local community, we\u2019ve been actively discussing creating a kind of \u2018Saturday school\u2019 curriculum, so that kids get religious instruction in a community setting, but from sources we trust and in which we can actively participate.\u201d The sources we don\u2019t trust: shady, unqualified imams and right-wing religious material published overseas.Instead, we\u2019re turning to our peers and our collective best judgment as well as centuries-old traditions.At home, my wife and I now deliberately pray in front of the kids. I prostrate toward Mecca and recite the Arabic verses out loud.Two weeks ago, during my night prayers, my son came up next to me, bowed and turned his head and smiled. There is no compulsion in religion, nor should there be. It\u2019s up to him and Nusayba to embrace or reject the faith and our traditions. My job is only to plant the seeds with care.Wajahat Ali is the author of the play \u201cThe Domestic Crusaders\u201d and creative director of Affinis Labs, a hub for social entrepreneurship and innovation.Advertisement"}

Do I even need to say that the series begins with the discovery of a dead woman\u2019s mutilated, mostly nude body? It does. But it also has depth and potency, particularly in its character development, if not always in its plotting. The eight-episode first season focuses on one particular investigation, and subsequent seasons keep the cop and lawyer characters but vary the cases.Watch if you like monkey business.

{"Headline": "Mike Birbiglia\u2019s 6 Tips for Making It Small in Hollywood. Or Anywhere.", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "Supported byThis summer, I went on a 30-city tour with my movie \u201cDon\u2019t Think Twice,\u201d a comedy about an improv group that has to decide whether to stay in show business when one member is plucked for a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d type of show. At every Q. and A. session for the movie, people would ask the same question: \u201cIf I want to be a comedian [or actor or writer or improviser or film director], how do I get started?\u201d The truth is they should probably pick someone more successful to ask \u2014 I make small films, small one-man shows Off Broadway and small comedy specials for Netflix \u2014 but I\u2019m the person who showed up to talk to them. And now I\u2019m the person offering you unsolicited advice \u2014 so if you don\u2019t need it or want it, this is not for you. Anyway, I\u2019ve boiled my answer down to six ideas.1. DON\u2019T WAITWrite. Make a short film. Go to an open mike. Take an improv class. There\u2019s no substitute for actually doing something. Don\u2019t talk about it anymore. Maybe don\u2019t even finish reading this essay.2. FAILThe bedrock of all good pieces of writing is 10 bad drafts. Maybe 20. I wrote 12 drafts of \u201cDon\u2019t Think Twice,\u201d 14 drafts of my first movie, \u201cSleepwalk With Me,\u201d and worked on my first one-man show for six years. My first five-minute set on \u201cLate Show With David Letterman\u201d in 2002 was mined from three hours of so-so material that I had tried and failed with for six years.3. LEARN FROM THE FAILUREThis is where it becomes important to find a community of people you respect. People who have good taste. People who might not be good at something themselves but know what good is. They might be in a theater company, at an improv school, or live in your dorm. They aren\u2019t the easiest thing to find. When I was in college, every Wednesday I drove my girlfriend Maggie\u2019s Ford Taurus to an open mike at a Best Western 40 minutes away, to enter a lottery of 30 comedians trying to win one of the nine spots to perform in front of the other angry 21 comedians.4. MAYBE QUIT5. BE BOLD ENOUGH TO MAKE STUFF THAT\u2019S SMALL BUT GREATAfter that, I no longer wanted to create projects for the Hollywood gatekeepers. The networks. The studios. Since then, I\u2019ve created a handful of pieces for \u201cThis American Life,\u201d self-produced three Off Broadway one-person shows, toured hundreds of cities around the world, and written, directed and starred in two feature films. All outside the system. Based on that work, I\u2019ve been offered small movie roles by people who work inside the system. Which is to say: Leaving the system behind and creating something of your own may actually be thing that gets you into the system, hopefully on your own terms.The point is, forget the gatekeepers. As far as I\u2019m concerned, what you create in a 30-seat, hole-in-the-wall improv theater in Phoenix can be far more meaningful than a mediocre sitcom being half-watched by seven million people. America doesn\u2019t need more stuff. We need more great stuff. You could make that.6. CLEVERNESS IS OVERRATED, AND HEART IS UNDERRATEDPlus, there are fewer people competing for heart, so you have a better chance of getting noticed. Sometimes people say, \u201cOne thing you have to offer in your work is yourself.\u201d I disagree. I think it\u2019s the only thing.Mike Birbiglia is a comedian, actor, writer and director. His new film, \u201cDon\u2019t Think Twice,\u201d is in theaters.Advertisement"}

Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.You came in during the fifth season. What\u2019s the hardest thing about directing for a series with an established story and tone?How so?It was death by a thousand cuts \u2014 lots and lots and lots of things to do, and lots of things to keep in mind. A simple but amazingly complicated aspect was the fact that we were lighting with sunlight. That seems totally normal \u2014 what could go wrong as long as the sun shines? But what I didn\u2019t realize is the sun rises in the east, and sets in the west. [Laughs.] So the direction you shoot in the morning, and the direction you shoot in the afternoon, are opposite to each other, and we had to completely change the schedule to accommodate where the sun was at any one point. Sometimes we would have to start with the end of a sequence. I didn\u2019t really get that until I was standing in the middle of the field.Do those kinds of challenges ever end up improving the final result?What was the single toughest thing you were asked to depict?Having 3,000 horses running at each other, especially after we discovered that horses cannot touch each other. It\u2019s illegal \u2014 it\u2019s a very valid rule about protecting the horses. So the very thing we were trying to do was not allowed. And we only had 70 horses.What was the solution?You would have one guy run into the frame, and then the horse rider would pull the horse, which means make the horse fall and lie down on its side. Later we would digitally superimpose another C.G.I. horse and make it seem like it had impacted the live one. Pulling horses down, you can do. It\u2019s about turning their necks in a certain direction, and then having two guys with a rope wrapped around the front two legs \u2014 they pull the rope, and then it allows them to fall very painlessly onto a bedded mulch base, so they\u2019re falling into a soft surface. But horses are quite smart, so after a couple of times, they won\u2019t let you.Which is harder to deal with? Horses or dragons?Luckily, the dragons aren\u2019t there. (Laughs.) The dragon on set is essentially a 14-foot green pole with a little green ball on the top of it. More often than not, it was me swinging it around and shouting cues for people to know the dragon was passing over them; the ball was there for an eye line. Amazingly, somehow when the dragon\u2019s on set \u2014 which, again, is literally a pole \u2014 people get excited. Most of the people who work on the show, and even the extras in whatever country you go to, they tend to be massive fans of the show. They all know what the dragon looks like, so it\u2019s not hard to get the excitement level up. Everyone loves horses, but we\u2019ve seen them before, so they\u2019re not as thrilling.Which scene made you the happiest when you saw the final version?Blimey, I couldn\u2019t do that question justice. I really, really liked shooting and doing the scene with Emilia Clarke and Peter Dinklage at the end of \u201cWinds of Winter,\u201d when she gives him the Hand of the Queen. Because we shot it very simply. We felt like we had managed to do something that was visual but really was a very intimate scene between two people.Is it wrong that I loved Tommen\u2019s suicide?No, it\u2019s absolutely right. Don\u2019t be shy. [Laughs.]It was visually evocative and painterly, and it was also a poignant parallel to the very first episode, when Bran was tossed from the window by Tommen\u2019s father, Jaime.It\u2019s great both that you enjoyed it and that you think it\u2019s wrong. I must admit I didn\u2019t draw that comparison, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s one David and Dan had in mind. It was scripted as shot \u2014 they wanted a single shot of him walking away out of frame, waiting an unusually long moment, and then returning and, without pause, throwing himself off the building. One of the most interesting things was trying to work out how long to have him offscreen before he came back. It\u2019s something I\u2019d never done \u2014 how long do I stay on an empty frame?Advertisement"}

While these experts and chefs are plenty enjoyable, the easy, goofy camaraderie between the Matthews is the real draw here.There are 13 episodes, and while it\u2019s gentle, breezy viewing, it\u2019s not really designed for all-day benders.

{"Headline": "From the N.F.L. to Hollywood, Trevor Pryce\u2019s Plan B", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byScene StealersLOS ANGELES \u2014 When Trevor Pryce retired as a pro football player in 2011, it would have been very easy for him to sit around in his boxer shorts all day, every day: Don\u2019t disturb me, I\u2019m watching \u201cJudge Judy.\u201dHe had millions of dollars in the bank after spending 14 years as a defensive end for the Denver Broncos, Baltimore Ravens and New York Jets. He had nothing more to prove, having made two winning trips to the Super Bowl. He was also selected four times to the Pro Bowl.As Mr. Pryce said on Monday, \u201cAfter working so hard on the field, it might make sense to get very busy doing absolutely nothing.\u201dMr. Pryce figured that his football fame would provide a running start, and he already had a little Hollywood experience. In 2008 he sold a movie idea to Sony Pictures about a guy who is struck by lighting and becomes a walking encyclopedia. (The studio ultimately dropped it.)You know where this yarn is headed: Film bigwigs stereotyping him as a dumb jock. \u201cDon\u2019t call us, we\u2019ll call you.\u201d Snickers about a football-related brain injury.But the last laugh may belong to Mr. Pryce. With persistence and unusual self-assurance (and a good portion of his savings), the plain-spoken father of three has clawed his way to the verge of show business.Mr. Pryce and the animators he hired \u2014 \u201cIf I didn\u2019t pay for this myself, nobody else was going to,\u201d he said \u2014 adapted \u201cKulipari\u201d from a trilogy of young adult novels he co-wrote after his plans for a frog war film went nowhere.

Most retired N.F.L. players, if they go on to second careers at all, stick with what they know: coaching or sports broadcasting.Very few have enough drive left to strike out in a new direction, something that requires enormous energy and focus and carries a lot of reputational risk. \u201cIt\u2019s true that a lot of guys don\u2019t want to keep burning the candle at both ends,\u201d Mr. Pryce said.Speaking by phone from Maryland, where he lives with his wife, Sonya, and three teenage children, he added: \u201cTo me, at least, there would be nothing worse than doing nothing. My whole life, up until retirement, was regimented with football, and I needed to maintain some kind of discipline. You can\u2019t just sit around watching \u2018Judge Judy\u2019 all day.\u201d (Speak for yourself, Trevor.)He said that Hollywood has definitely not been the \u201csexy good time\u201d he envisioned, although he added that some movie and television executives have gone out of their way to help him. One was Doug Belgrad, the former president of Sony\u2019s Motion Picture Group, who bought the lightning-bolt idea as a possible Adam Sandler vehicle.Mr. Pryce still gets upset at rejection, as recently happened when he pitched video game executives on a \u201cKulipari\u201d-related concept.\u201cI can still see the stupid look on their faces,\u201d he said, his voice rising. \u201cYou fly back home with anger in your veins. And you drink a lot of Scotch. And then you calm down and you start again.\u201dWhat advice does he have for anyone with similar aspirations?\u201cNever be afraid to call an executive,\u201d he said. \u201cI go through studio and network lists and find the person marked \u2018president\u2019 and dial. Remember that you\u2019re also bringing something valuable to the table. It\u2019s not all about them.\u201dWith that, Mr. Pryce had to go. His English bulldog, Brixton, had decided to run down the street. (\u201cDog! Don\u2019t make me come chase you.\u201d) But I had one last question: What happens if \u201cKulipari: An Army of Frogs\u201d does not, well, strike a chord?His answer was swift: \u201cNot possible.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Everyone loves horses, but we\u2019ve seen them before, so they\u2019re not as thrilling.Which scene made you the happiest when you saw the final version?Blimey, I couldn\u2019t do that question justice. I really, really liked shooting and doing the scene with Emilia Clarke and Peter Dinklage at the end of \u201cWinds of Winter,\u201d when she gives him the Hand of the Queen. Because we shot it very simply. We felt like we had managed to do something that was visual but really was a very intimate scene between two people.Is it wrong that I loved Tommen\u2019s suicide?No, it\u2019s absolutely right. Don\u2019t be shy. [Laughs.]It was visually evocative and painterly, and it was also a poignant parallel to the very first episode, when Bran was tossed from the window by Tommen\u2019s father, Jaime.It\u2019s great both that you enjoyed it and that you think it\u2019s wrong. I must admit I didn\u2019t draw that comparison, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s one David and Dan had in mind. It was scripted as shot \u2014 they wanted a single shot of him walking away out of frame, waiting an unusually long moment, and then returning and, without pause, throwing himself off the building. One of the most interesting things was trying to work out how long to have him offscreen before he came back. It\u2019s something I\u2019d never done \u2014 how long do I stay on an empty frame?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Halt and Catch Fire\u2019 Clears Its Cache for Season 3", "Date": "2016-08-19", "News": "Supported byATLANTA \u2014 When it comes to AMC\u2019s 1980s tech drama \u201cHalt and Catch Fire,\u201d its main cast members have been one of the show\u2019s few constants. The relationships, subject matter and locations have all gotten a CTRL-ALT-DEL at the outset of each of the show\u2019s three 10-episode seasons.The series, which debuted in 2014 one week after the \u201cMad Men\u201d midseason finale, shared that show\u2019s time slot as well as its workplace vibe, enigmatic antihero (here, Lee Pace from \u201cPushing Daisies\u201d) and intricate engagement with historical events. The characters and stories on \u201cHalt\u201d are fictional but run alongside the early histories of companies like Hewlett-Packard, Apple and IBM, which was a major presence in each of the show\u2019s first two seasons.\u201cHalt and Catch Fire,\u201d a phrase that refers to a computer problem that necessitates a reboot, is appropriate for a show that has gone through a number of permutations: It began as a series about the emergence of personal computing, pivoted into one about the genesis of online communities, and is now moving from Texas to Silicon Valley to focus on the development of internet commerce.There\u2019s also a reboot behind the camera. The new season, which begins on Tuesday, Aug. 23, will be the first with Christopher Cantwell and Christopher C. Rogers as showrunners; they created the series and worked for two seasons under the showrunner Jonathan Lisco, who left to create this summer\u2019s TNT series \u201cAnimal Kingdom.\u201dOn a soundstage here in June, Mr. Rogers explained that the tech industry, even in the \u201980s, was in a state of constant change. \u201cThe industry was so much about failing fast, figuring out what went wrong and making a whole new thing out of it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting every year, because we\u2019re starting over in a sense, and at this point we have an emotional back story with these characters that we can bring to new scenarios.\u201dThe first season centered on a computer executive (Mr. Pace) and a hardware genius (Scoot McNairy) who hack the market-leading IBM computer and build a lighter, faster version called the Giant. They start a PC division from scratch at the electronics company where they work and bring the Giant to market with bravado, cunning and gamesmanship.\u201cSeason 1 was almost a corporate thriller that had a clandestine, fun, sexy, dark feeling to it,\u201d said Kerry Bish\u00e9, whose character, Donna Clark, evolved from a risk-averse Texas Instruments assistant to a reluctant entrepreneur. \u201cWe\u2019re a world away from that now.\u201dIn Season 2, Mr. Pace and Mr. McNairy\u2019s characters went their separate ways, and the focus shifted to the origin story of a fictional online community called Mutiny that was a precursor to dial-up services like CompuServe and AOL. Mackenzie Davis, whose Cameron Howe was a supporting character in the first season, and Ms. Bish\u00e9\u2019s Donna start Mutiny as an outlet for online games and spend the season figuring out whether games or chat rooms have the brighter future.The more fluid and collaborative approach that the women took with Mutiny was in pointed contrast to the schemes and power games that the men undertook in developing the Giant. It was a shift that many critics focused on when praising the second season, but one that Ms. Davis and Ms. Bish\u00e9 play down.Ms. Davis said the show has never emphasized the characters\u2019 gender. \u201cIt comes up, but the Chrises [Mr. Rogers and Mr. Cantwell] are more interested in what it\u2019s like for entrepreneurs and idealists and ambitious people to succeed greatly and to fail greatly rather than focusing on the fact that they\u2019re women.\u201dMs. Bish\u00e9 added, \u201cMackenzie and I are of the mind that we treat these characters as people first, and whatever conclusion an audience draws about them being women is almost incidental.\u201dThe new season follows Mutiny\u2019s expansion from a dial-up service, which had to lease server space, to a 100,000-user community with its own mainframe. And while it is set in 1986, the issues \u2014 online privacy, technology creeping into people\u2019s daily lives, even recreational marijuana use \u2014 are strikingly contemporary.\u201cI.P.O. culture and the way Silicon Valley is with money and the progression of women in power are certainly in the ether right now,\u201d Ms. Davis said.AMC\u2019s \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d which ended in 2013, grew over time as viewers found earlier seasons of the series on Netflix, caught up and came back to AMC for later seasons. Streaming services have created a new revenue stream for networks like AMC, but the idea that Netflix viewers would come back to AMC for new seasons of shows has not borne out.\u201cEven with the emergence of Netflix, Hulu and Amazon, season-to-season growth is a real rarity,\u201d said Joel Stillerman, president of original programming and development for AMC. \u201cThere is a tiny handful of shows launched in the era of streaming video that have had season-to-season growth. \u2018Breaking Bad\u2019 was perfectly timed to take advantage of the emergence of Netflix, but it has not worked out that having a show on Netflix leads to bigger ratings.\u201dHBO\u2019s \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d lampoons the arrogant grandeur of today\u2019s tech industry, and shows like USA\u2019s \u201cMr. Robot\u201d and Netflix\u2019s \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d examine the darker aspects of tech in our lives. But in continuing to reinvent itself, \u201cHalt and Catch Fire\u201d is a stripped-down exploration of those ideas that began in the 1980s.\u201cThere were major players in Silicon Valley by that time,\u201d Mr. Cantwell said. \u201cOur characters are coming into that as the new kids on the block. They think they can play in the big leagues now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Football Intrigue? Don\u2019t Look at the N.F.L.", "Date": "2016-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookSo far, though, \u201cHard Knocks,\u201d which began on Aug. 9 and broadcasts new episodes each Tuesday night, hasn\u2019t done much with either possibility. We\u2019ve seen Goff standing around with Case Keenum, his main competition, but there has been little about how he is being developed. As for the homecoming angle, it received some attention in Episode 2, when the team\u2019s first preseason game brought professional football back to Los Angeles for the first time in decades. But the treatment was basically what you could have seen watching the game on television.So what is the program\u2019s definition of \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d access? Well, we\u2019ve learned that William Hayes, a defensive end, believes that mermaids are real but that dinosaurs weren\u2019t. We\u2019ve seen players enjoy a day at Disneyland. We\u2019ve met the safety T. J. McDonald\u2019s dogs.This kind of fluff is no surprise, since the show is produced in association with N.F.L. Films, the league\u2019s public-relations factory, but it seems increasingly out of phase. The protective bubble that the image-conscious N.F.L. has long kept around itself has begun to leak in recent years. Against reporting about concussions, domestic violence, drug issues and such, footage of players wearing Mickey Mouse ears becomes unwatchable. This week the Rams and other teams have to begin cutting their rosters down to size, and \u201cHard Knocks\u201d will no doubt have stories to tell about dashed dreams. But based on what we\u2019ve seen, even those seem likely to be soft-pedaled.A much better behind-the-scenes football show turned up on Netflix this summer, \u201cLast Chance U,\u201d about the program at East Mississippi Community College in the tiny town of Scooba. The college has made a point of recruiting players who have flamed out at major-college programs, failed to qualify for Division I academically or otherwise had trouble capitalizing on their football talent. The result has been a dynasty, and as the team entered play last season \u2014 the one documented in the series \u2014 it had won 24 games in a row.There\u2019s a quarterback competition in this series too, and it is actually developed in some depth. So are the stories of individual players, who took varying paths to East Mississippi, but all seem to hope they won\u2019t be staying long; the whole point of going there is to re-establish their football credentials and be recruited by a bigger school.The real star of the series, though, is Brittany Wagner, the athletic academic adviser, who struggles, sometimes heartbreakingly, to get the players to take their classes seriously. Their indifference and lack of preparedness are often stunning.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Grandmaster Flash Beats Back Time", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "The Hip-Hop PioneerThe Netflix series \u201cThe Get Down\u201d is bringing new attention to the pioneering hip-hop D.J. born Joseph Saddler, who, unlike many of his peers from the music\u2019s early days, continues to work.Supported byHe was Joseph Saddler then, a nerdy high school student who liked to take appliances apart to see how they worked. In a few short years, though, in the hardest-hit part of a hard-hit city, he helped to invent what many would agree was the most sweeping cultural movement of the last 40 years, and then he barely hung on to see it bloom.The four-decade roller-coaster ride of Grandmaster Flash, now 58, is a tale as improbable and as distinctly New York as that of hip-hop itself, filled with raw creativity, fame, drugs, broken friendships, lawsuits and, finally, something like smooth sailing. In parallel with the city that produced it, hip-hop emerged in the mid-1970s as a symbol of urban decay and evolved into a gilded spectacle of consumption. Mr. Saddler, the music\u2019s first virtuoso, rode its initial wave, got crushed by the second and rebounded as one of the few from his generation whose careers are still going strong.On a recent day in Harlem, he spread a wrinkled sheet of paper on the table of a Mexican takeout place as if opening his notes for a lecture. His features have filled out from the angular profile he had as a teenager, but he still looked athletic and lithe. He had just returned from England, where he had D.J.ed for 10,000 people. He was wearing a bright red baseball cap with the letters GF and a T-shirt that said Grandmaster, not exactly incognito.The series, set in hip-hop\u2019s gestational period, has brought him back to the streets and parks where he started, now a middle-aged man straddling two eras connected by a sound that people said would never last.\u201cSo here it is, 40 years later, it caught on,\u201d he said. \u201cPretty euphoric.\u201dHe declined to talk about the bad times or his early record company, Sugar Hill, or the rappers he worked with, the Furious Five, two of whom have called Flash the Milli Vanilli of hip-hop. He sneered at a nearby restaurant called Sugar Hill Cafe, saying the name made him sick.\u201cLife has been good,\u201d he said. \u201cEven during the times that were really tough, I\u2019m really O.K. People poke holes in me. Some people are mad at me, most people love me. It\u2019s O.K. Nobody\u2019s perfect.\u201dThese days, he said, he enjoys being a father, and lying low when he is back in town. The world is finally catching up to him. \u201cYou gotta realize that this thing here, this is the youngest of all the cultures, hip-hop,\u201d he said. \u201cRock\u2019s been around forever. Pop\u2019s been around forever. This is the youngest, so it\u2019s the least understood. But it is the biggest. The biggest monster.\u201dJoseph and his younger sister entered foster care when he was 8, shuttling first among foster homes in the Bronx, then spending five years at the Greer School near Poughkeepsie. There, he got his first chance to D.J. at a school dance, playing Bobby Byrd\u2019s \u201cI Know You Got Soul\u201d for an interracial crowd.\u201cI say the Bronx created it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all played a part. Herc was first, the founder. Then Bam had the most selections. And I just came up with a way to deliver the music, technically speaking. So the three of us together sort of figured it out.\u201d\u201cThis is my math and my science,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m actually readjusting time. I\u2019m taking this break, it\u2019s 10 seconds, I\u2019m making it 10 minutes, you don\u2019t know when it\u2019s beginning or ending.\u201dVoices could now rhyme over the beat without being interrupted by a record\u2019s verses and choruses. \u201cThis was the birth of rap,\u201d he said, only partly overstating the case. \u201cSo this Quik Mix Theory caused the whole culture. It\u2019s scary to think about sometimes. But that\u2019s what it did.\u201dBut first someone had to rap. Flash tried emulating the patter of disco D.J.s, who talked while they spun, but he was too busy with the turntables, so he left a microphone for people from the crowd to talk. \u201cMany people failed,\u201d he said. A local resident named Robert Keith Wiggins, calling himself Cowboy, started spitting call-and-response rhymes to Flash\u2019s beats, exhorting crowds to say \u201cho\u201d or to \u201cthrow your hands in the air and wave \u2019em like you just don\u2019t care\u201d \u2014 lines that would become hip-hop staples for decades to come.\u201cFlash had megaskills,\u201d Mr. Stein said. \u201cHe did a lot of show-offy stuff, scratching with his elbows and behind his back. His timing was always precise. The whole thing was furious energy the whole time. It was eye-opening.\u201d When Mr. Stein later raved about the music to people in the business, he said, \u201cI\u2019d say 100 percent said it was a fad and that it would go away.\u201dGangs ran the Bronx in those years: Savage Skulls, Black Pearls, Black Spades, Seven Immortals, Savage Nomads, Roman Kings, Ghetto Brothers, Persuaders. A group of former Black Spades known as the Casanova Crew provided security at Flash\u2019s parties; they were as rough as anyone who might cause trouble.For Mr. Saddler, the pieces fell into place quickly. He became Flash, from his short-lived graffiti tag, FLASH 163, and Grandmaster \u2014 like a martial arts expert \u2014 for the way he cut up beats. More M.C.s joined, until they had become the Furious Five: Cowboy, Melle Mel, Kidd Creole, Scorpio and, the last to arrive, Rahiem. The parties got bigger and wilder.\u201cIt was the most amazing spectacle of my adolescent life at that time,\u201d said Guy Todd Williams, 53, a.k.a. Rahiem, who saw the group in 1978 and joined the next year. \u201cThey were entertainers. You didn\u2019t just come to hear them, you came to see them as well. What he was doing musically on the turntables was unprecedented at the time.\u201d At one party, Mr. Williams said, Cowboy started teasing a friend who had enlisted in the military, mocking the march cadence, \u201chip, hop, hip, hop.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s where the term derived from,\u201d Mr. Williams said.For Grandmaster Flash, barely out of his teens, the parties where he performed meant status, women and enough money to start a cocaine habit, which grew along with his paychecks.\u201cWe all began to dabble with cocaine,\u201d Mr. Williams said. The money also led to arguments among group members, who complained that Flash was being paid more for shows than they were, and briefly parted with him to work with Mr. Mandes instead. (Two group members, Melle Mel and Scorpio, declined to be interviewed for this article because of their differences with Flash.)The bottom also came quickly for Flash. By November 1983, not four years into his recording career, he had split with the group and was strung out and broke, selling his possessions for pennies on the dollar and making mix tapes for drug dealers in exchange for drugs. Once, in a dingy basement on 127th Street and St. Nicholas Avenue, where he had gone to freebase cocaine, he heard the latest record by his old M.C Melle Mel, \u201cWhite Lines (Don\u2019t Do It).\u201d He smoked away the next two years before landing in a coma in St. Barnabas Hospital, weighing just 118 pounds. It took a decade, and the death of Cowboy, wasted by drugs or illness, to climb back into the light.\u201cAt 23, I was flexed,\u201d Flash told David Ritz, who wrote Flash\u2019s autobiography. \u201cAt 28, I was taking the train.\u201dHip-hop, whose evolution rendered the group obsolete, evolved again, opening a path for Flash not as a young revolutionary but as a keeper of the old tradition. In music\u2019s least nostalgic genre, there is now a place for oldies and legends. \u201cLast week in England I decided to go \u201970s the whole night, and I couldn\u2019t leave the stage,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m just really sure this \u201970s music is something people want to hear today.\u201dIf so, \u201cThe Get Down\u201d \u2014 the first six episodes were released this month \u2014 aims directly at that hunger. Funk beats ooze from the soundtrack; long scenes dissect the Quik Mix Theory; bullets fly across barren streetscapes. For Flash, the series has functioned as a homecoming of sorts, even if you can never return to adolescence.\u201cIt\u2019s sad how people paint the Bronx like it was some kind of O.K. Corral,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it was a city of experimentation. We left no stone unturned musically. Life was a lot simpler then. I didn\u2019t see a whole lot of problems in that period. Maybe it was because I knew how to handle the corral. But I do know that when I came out in the park, all the gangsters, all the gang members and everybody would come to the park in total, total peace. The biggest gangs would buy soda, chips and popcorn for like 500 people. You\u2019d see guys with a reputation for being super-ruthless, but they were the kindest guys to my audience. The police officer would be right across the street drinking a soda, because anybody that could be starting trouble was right in the park with me. So they allowed us to play until 11 or 12 o\u2019clock.\u201dWith \u201cThe Get Down,\u201d he said, he hopes to convey that dimension of hip-hop\u2019s formative period. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great time,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m excited for people to take a look. I ain\u2019t trying to change anybody. I just say, Here\u2019s what it was.\u201d Four decades after its inception, he said, hip-hop is now \u201ca billion-dollar business.\u201d\u201cSomebody has to say, where did this thing come from?\u201d he said. \u201cWho baked this cake? Why not ask the baker?\u201dHis silence on aspects of the past aside, he said he was not bitter about the money he never earned from his hit records or concerts, or the wealth earned by the stars who followed him.\u201cI\u2019m so glad I didn\u2019t come in at this time,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mind spending the 10, 12 years building a solid foundation of what I do, and have people follow me, so that when I got into the lions\u2019 den, which is the industry, I didn\u2019t get eaten up. So it\u2019s a good thing now.\u201dHe gestured out the window to the new buildings rising on 145th Street. Most of his peers now perform sporadically, if at all. Some, like Cowboy, are gone. If Flash no longer rules the Bronx, he enjoys a different, broader kind of success.\u201cI accept change,\u201d he said. \u201cForty years ago that might have been a grocery store. Today it\u2019s a Caribbean market. If you don\u2019t accept change, change will leave you behind. So I\u2019m good with change. Oh, yeah.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Steven Avery, of \u2018Making a Murderer,\u2019 Eyes Freedom After Co-Defendant\u2019s Conviction Is Overturned", "Date": "2016-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe two men were found guilty in 2007 of the murder of Teresa Halbach, a 25-year-old photographer who disappeared on Halloween in 2005.Kathleen Zellner, the lawyer who took over Mr. Avery\u2019s defense in January, weeks after the Netflix series was released, said she has a different person in mind who she believes killed Ms. Halbach.Here\u2019s where the case stands.Ms. Zellner said she would file a motion next week to access DNA evidence collected from the crime scene and used against Mr. Avery. She plans to order new testing, some of which was not possible during the original trial.She hopes that the new evidence, combined with new theories and the revisiting of old evidence, could be enough to free Mr. Avery, 54.\u201cThere is evidence that already exists in the case that points to a different location and a different suspect,\u201d Ms. Zellner said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a combination of forensic evidence and a tip from somebody that we\u2019ve interviewed multiple times that we think is credible.\u201dHer alternate-suspect theory has not been presented before, she said. But she declined to elaborate, saying details would emerge after the new forensic testing.Prosecutors cited several pieces of physical evidence linking Mr. Avery to the crime when he was convicted. Investigators discovered:\u25a0 His blood in Ms. Halbach\u2019s car, which was found on his salvage yard property;\u25a0 His sweat under the latch of her car\u2019s hood;\u25a0 Her DNA on a bullet in his garage;\u25a0 And his DNA on a key to her car that was found in his bedroom.Ms. Zellner said new forms of testing could prove that the physical evidence had been planted, echoing a prominent suggestion of the Netflix series. Most of the tests can be done within a few weeks, she said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s possible all of it will be done within 60 days.\u201dShe added: \u201cIt may not all be successful, but I believe if even one bit of evidence is planted, the conviction is going to be vacated.\u201dHe will be released from prison unless the authorities decide within 90 days to schedule a new trial. The judge\u2019s ruling does not directly affect Mr. Avery\u2019s case.At this point, Ms. Zellner\u2019s arguments for Mr. Avery\u2019s innocence are absent any point-by-point rebuttal from prosecutors, as would happen in a trial.\u201cThe attorney general and Wisconsin Department of Justice will make their arguments in court and feel confident Mr. Avery\u2019s conviction will be upheld,\u201d Johnny Koremenos, a spokesman for Attorney General Brad Schimel, said in a statement.\u201cOf course, the attorney general wants to see justice prevail and will evaluate any new, credible evidence brought forward.\u201d\u201cSteven Avery committed this murder and this mutilation, and Steven Avery is exactly where he needs to be,\u201d he said.\u201cMaking a Murderer,\u201d the 10-part series created by Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos, focused on the intertwined cases of Mr. Avery and Mr. Dassey and left doubts about the legitimacy of their convictions.Before the murder case unfolded, Mr. Avery was convicted of sexual assault in 1985, spending 18 years in prison \u2014 only to be exonerated in 2003. Less than two years after his release, he was arrested in the killing of Ms. Halbach, who had gone to his property to photograph a car for Auto Trader magazine.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a more graphic, compelling illustration of a crime scene that was fabricated,\u201d she said.The documentary raised the possibility that Mr. Avery\u2019s blood that was recovered from the inside Ms. Halbach\u2019s car had been planted from a vial collected in 1996 for the sexual assault case.Ms. Zellner said one of the tests she hopes to run will date Mr. Avery\u2019s blood used as evidence in the murder conviction.Additional tests would identify the source of other physical evidence cited by prosecutors. For instance, the lawyer says that among the evidence she believes had been planted is Ms. Halbach\u2019s bones, which were found in a burn pit on his property.Ms. Zellner also points to Ms. Halbach\u2019s car, where Mr. Avery\u2019s blood was found in the front and Ms. Halbach\u2019s was found in the back. The forensic scientists she spoke to said there would likely be a mixture of their blood, she said.\u201cThis is a crime scene that just doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d she said.New experts would speak to the findings from those new tests, she said. One expert \u201ccould have been called at the trial but wasn\u2019t,\u201d she added.Mr. Avery\u2019s past legal maneuverings have failed.A federal judge denied his request for a new trial in 2010, and the Wisconsin Supreme Court declined to review the case. He filed an appeal on his own behalf in January; it is pending. He remains imprisoned in the Waupun Correctional Institution in Waupon, Wisc.Ms. Zellner said her interest was not in the existing appeal, which would not allow her to present new evidence. She said she intended to take it to the trial-court level and request an evidentiary hearing for the new material.She said she believed he\u2019s innocent. She said she had visited Mr. Avery in prison after Mr. Dassey\u2019s ruling, and he appeared happy and shocked by the news.\u201cI think he just couldn\u2019t believe anything good had happened,\u201d she said.Netflix has signed on for a second season of \u201cMaking a Murderer,\u201d and Ms. Zellner has granted the filmmakers interviews. No release date has been revealed.Ms. Ricciardi and Ms. Demos said in a statement, \u201cAs we have done for the past 10 years, we will continue to document the story as it unfolds, and follow it wherever it may lead.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I look around at my city, and I think that\u2019s ridiculous.\u201dMr. Allen said he hoped the show involved play on a more \u201cnarrative-moral level,\u201d in which players are protagonists beyond just the created world.\u201cI don\u2019t know how often somebody leaves the game thinking about Chicago violence,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they\u2019ll leave thinking about weapons and escalation and the idea that more weapons don\u2019t make anybody safe.\u201dIn the game Cards Against Humanity, a raunchy riff on Apples to Apples, players match question-and-answer cards to come up with humorously offensive combinations.Angie McMahon, the director of \u201cHorrible Fun,\u201d said Cards Against Humanity matches well with improv because it keeps the audience from feeling the need to be funny.\u201cThe audience is protected because the jokes have been pre-written for them,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to think of something funny. They can say the combination is funny, and it gives them a premise to an improv scene.\u201dAlthough the show is advertised as \u201cdirty, ridiculous, offensive and horrible,\u201d its keener improvisers know that going gross goes only so far. Ms. McMahon\u2019s advice? \u201cThe cards are dirty enough, so let\u2019s play smart,\u201d she said.\u201cWhen I started seeing the two together, I thought about rules,\u201d Mr. Ooi said. \u201cIn the game, there are rules about how the world works and what you can and can\u2019t do, and how you figure out how a character succeeds or fails. In dating there are rules, too, but the rules of Dungeons & Dragons are concrete. You can fudge them here and there, but the rules of dating are all over the place.\u201dUnlike its interactive peers, \u201cDating and Dragons\u201d is a traditional stage play. An avid gamer named Jack falls for a woman but is stymied by his inability to master the rules of dating. Avatars, including a barbaric orc with an ax and a cloaked shape-shifter act out the role-playing games played by the stage characters.For Mr. Ooi, the parallels between Dungeons & Dragons and theater come down to a fondness for shared storytelling.\u201cIn a play, you have someone write, and you all agree on a set of rules to construct a world, including the audience, and what the rules are,\u201d he said. \u201cWith D&D, it\u2019s the same thing. You get a master who\u2019s like the author, and you have players and they are the actors. The dungeon master either creates a world or presents one to the players, and they create the story together.\u201d\u201cI was worried that it might be too gamey, like a game show,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it works as theater in that you bring in all the religious comedy, about concepts of heaven and hell and who\u2019s there. When you start to get people to talk about it, that\u2019s when the theatricality comes out. It becomes an experience.\u201dAny fears died quickly once a certain group started attending.\u201cNuns love bingo and religion and the prizes,\u201d Ms. Quade said. \u201cWhen I go to the door and say goodbye to the audience, I go back to my desk and all my holy cards are gone.\u201d\u201cYou start rooting for your numbers, and it becomes competitive,\u201d said Mr. Collins, the managing director of Actors Theater in St. Paul, where the show originated in 2005. \u201cThe psychology is perfect.\u201dIrish and Italian sensibilities permeate \u201cWe Gotta Bingo,\u201d which calls to mind the broad ethnic humor played interactively in \u201cTony n\u2019 Tina\u2019s Wedding.\u201d Like the shared experience of a wedding, Mr. Collins said bingo is \u201cpretty universal,\u201d a reason his show draws more than just Catholics with memories of parish fund-raisers. Still, \u201cWe Gotta Bingo,\u201d he said, is \u201cnot a New York show.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Midwestern,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Chicago, people are very in touch with their ethnicities and their parishes and all those tribes. Chicagoans are adventurous and willing to laugh at themselves and take risks on what a lot of other people might say, \u2018Oh, a show about bingo sounds too cheesy.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alexi Pappas Shares Secrets From the Olympic Village", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve just landed home after nearly a month living in the Olympic Athlete Village in Rio. At the airport, I even tried to use my athlete credential instead of my passport to check into my flight. A shift back to the real world will start for me now. But before too many of my memories fade, I thought I\u2019d share a glimpse of life \u2014 the athletes, the food, the condoms \u2014 from the Olympic Village. My Greek team and I shared a building with Croatia, Algeria and Ethiopia, among others. The Croatian staff could always be found in the lobby of our shared building smoking cigarettes and jovially watching the Games on television from beanbag chairs. House music thumped from the balconies above at all hours of the day and night.I had four suite-mates and one roommate. My room was small, dressed in IKEA head to toe, but I turned it into my home. At the end of the Games every athlete took their custom Rio Olympics bed comforter with them \u00e2\u0080\u0094 mine took up half a suitcase.I would leave the Village most days to train, compete or watch other competitions. Each time I came home from the outside world I had to get my credential scanned, my photo checked against my face, and my belongings scanned in a bomb detector. The security line was a great place to trade pins and make friends with fellow athletes returning home from their Olympic adventures.In the dining hall, I saw team jackets from every possible country \u2014 Sri Lanka, Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria, Dominican Republic, Lesotho, Morocco, Nigeria, Croatia, Japan, South Korea, Ecuador, Myanmar \u00e2\u0080\u0094 everyone in their specific colors, like a Wes Anderson film. Even though I often ventured to the dining hall alone, I always managed to find someone to meet and eat with. One day, I sat with Katie Ledecky, who liked to eat lots of bacon. I later watched in awe as she won several gold medals. I got the courage to ask Venus Williams for a photograph. Her hair was dyed USA-red \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I loved it.No matter what country or sport, athletes can tell when other athletes needed their space. After all, today could be their big day. If they were carefully twirling their pasta noodles on a spoon, or seemed to be moving either very quickly or very slowly, that probably meant today was the biggest day of their life. When I saw Michael Phelps with his hood up and headphones in, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother him.But even when you remove an athlete from competition, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take the competition out of them. When you challenge a Russian weightlifter to a game of ping pong (like my dad did), you will probably lose. Even though there is not a medal at stake here in the game lounge, it is nearly impossible for Olympic athletes not to try their best. It comes from the same immutable competitive instincts as my determination to always peel my oranges in a single peel. We can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help it.While inquiring about the free dental exams, I met a volunteer doctor from Brooklyn named David. He called the International Olympic Committee every day for a year to get the chance to live and work for free in the village. He told me that the reason that doctor and dentist offices were so packed at all hours of the day is because for many athletes and coaches from less-developed parts of the world, this was the first doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appointment they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had in four years \u00e2\u0080\u0094 since the last Olympics.The reason the condom machines never ran out was because there was a condom fairy who roamed around with a knapsack full of condoms with the sole purpose of keeping the condom dispensers stocked. The dispensers read \u00e2\u0080\u009ccelebrate with a condom\u00e2\u0080\u009d in three different languages.I often saw athletes wandering hand in hand at sunset along the shoestring of waterways that laced between the 20-odd residential buildings. Once it was dark, the parties began \u00e2\u0080\u0094 often in the pool outside my building, and always well past my bedtime. Morning walks of shame were not uncommon, with an athlete wearing mismatched country clothes scurrying across one of the walkways between the thousands of balconies and waving flags. As a Greek, I entered the stadium first. I wondered if this is how Rihanna feels at her concerts? I tried not to cry, but every time I made eye contact with any person, I cried. At the center of the stage, a smiling person dressed entirely in green approached me and offered me a small oval pellet: a tree seed. She guided my hand towards a cardboard planter box and I planted the tree right there on the stage. For a moment, I forgot about the thousands of people around me and just focused on the little seed. The best thing to say \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the only thing to say \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is \u00e2\u0080\u009csee you in Tokyo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

This month, it was reborn as MTV Classic, a channel focusing on music videos and shows from the \u201980s to the aughts. The nostalgia baton has officially been passed to the millennials.In its first week, MTV Classic served up Mariah Carey in a butterfly necklace, TLC in silk pajamas and Gwen Stefani with a bindi. It broadcast reruns of \u201cBeavis and Butt-Head,\u201d \u201cDaria,\u201d Ashton Kutcher-era \u201cPunk\u2019d\u201d and a retrospective on \u201cTotal Request Live.\u201d Welcome to the BuzzFeed-ification of MTV \u2014 the music channel\u2019s attempt to reel in youngish viewers by appealing to their sentimentality for the recent past.As a millennial elder, I am MTV Classic\u2019s target demographic. I saw \u201cBeavis and Butt-Head Do America\u201d in theaters. Daria was my high school antiheroine. In my day, if you wanted to watch the new Limp Bizkit video, you had to wait for Carson Daly to debut it on \u201cTRL.\u201dJust a decade or two later, I\u2019m ready to reminisce about Lisa Frank folders and Puff Daddy videos. It makes sense that millennials, the most recorded generation in history, would romanticize the era just before smartphones became ubiquitous. We\u2019re fascinated by documents of life before everything was documented.MTV Classic offers that stuff 24/7. In the morning, music video blocks are stocked with Super Soakers, scrunchies and velour separates. Evenings bring reruns of shows like \u201cJackass\u201d and \u201cClone High.\u201d There\u2019s also fodder for the slightly older crowd: \u201cHeadbangers,\u201d a hostless version of the old \u201cHeadbangers Ball,\u201d delivers David Lee Roth prancing in a m\u00e9lange of sparkly bodysuits, and Megadeth burning the Constitution. The video marathon \u201cI Want My \u201980s\u201d features George Michael playacting as straight, on a yacht.Too bad it\u2019s all on TV. Millennials may pine for the television of the past, but that doesn\u2019t mean that we want to watch it on a television. Our pre-internet nostalgia is a sentiment largely expressed online. We binge \u201cFriends\u201d on Netflix, collect Pok\u00e9mon on our phones and scroll through evidence of resurrected \u201990s trends (Gigi Hadid in a velvet choker, Kylie Jenner\u2019s taupe lips) on Instagram.As a kid, I watched MTV in my older brother\u2019s bedroom, door slammed shut, hissing, \u201cI am Cornholio!\u201d back at the fuzzy old TV. But now culture is consumed on laptops and phones, while parents are watching prestige dramas on the living room flat screen.Die-hard fans might opt to DVR \u201cWonder Showzen\u201d and \u201cDaria\u201d instead of paying to watch them on iTunes or Hulu, but for the most part, the channel\u2019s \u201990s ear worms and throwback fashions are best packaged as linkable conversation starters, not cable video blocks. Post-YouTube, the experience of even watching an entire music video all the way through \u2014 much less 30 in a row, cut up by commercials \u2014 feels interminable.

{"Headline": "\u2018Halt and Catch Fire\u2019 Clears Its Cache for Season 3", "Date": "2016-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATLANTA \u2014 When it comes to AMC\u2019s 1980s tech drama \u201cHalt and Catch Fire,\u201d its main cast members have been one of the show\u2019s few constants. The relationships, subject matter and locations have all gotten a CTRL-ALT-DEL at the outset of each of the show\u2019s three 10-episode seasons.The series, which debuted in 2014 one week after the \u201cMad Men\u201d midseason finale, shared that show\u2019s time slot as well as its workplace vibe, enigmatic antihero (here, Lee Pace from \u201cPushing Daisies\u201d) and intricate engagement with historical events. The characters and stories on \u201cHalt\u201d are fictional but run alongside the early histories of companies like Hewlett-Packard, Apple and IBM, which was a major presence in each of the show\u2019s first two seasons.\u201cHalt and Catch Fire,\u201d a phrase that refers to a computer problem that necessitates a reboot, is appropriate for a show that has gone through a number of permutations: It began as a series about the emergence of personal computing, pivoted into one about the genesis of online communities, and is now moving from Texas to Silicon Valley to focus on the development of internet commerce.There\u2019s also a reboot behind the camera. The new season, which begins on Tuesday, Aug. 23, will be the first with Christopher Cantwell and Christopher C. Rogers as showrunners; they created the series and worked for two seasons under the showrunner Jonathan Lisco, who left to create this summer\u2019s TNT series \u201cAnimal Kingdom.\u201dOn a soundstage here in June, Mr. Rogers explained that the tech industry, even in the \u201980s, was in a state of constant change. \u201cThe industry was so much about failing fast, figuring out what went wrong and making a whole new thing out of it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting every year, because we\u2019re starting over in a sense, and at this point we have an emotional back story with these characters that we can bring to new scenarios.\u201dThe first season centered on a computer executive (Mr. Pace) and a hardware genius (Scoot McNairy) who hack the market-leading IBM computer and build a lighter, faster version called the Giant. They start a PC division from scratch at the electronics company where they work and bring the Giant to market with bravado, cunning and gamesmanship.\u201cSeason 1 was almost a corporate thriller that had a clandestine, fun, sexy, dark feeling to it,\u201d said Kerry Bish\u00e9, whose character, Donna Clark, evolved from a risk-averse Texas Instruments assistant to a reluctant entrepreneur. \u201cWe\u2019re a world away from that now.\u201dIn Season 2, Mr. Pace and Mr. McNairy\u2019s characters went their separate ways, and the focus shifted to the origin story of a fictional online community called Mutiny that was a precursor to dial-up services like CompuServe and AOL. Mackenzie Davis, whose Cameron Howe was a supporting character in the first season, and Ms. Bish\u00e9\u2019s Donna start Mutiny as an outlet for online games and spend the season figuring out whether games or chat rooms have the brighter future.The more fluid and collaborative approach that the women took with Mutiny was in pointed contrast to the schemes and power games that the men undertook in developing the Giant. It was a shift that many critics focused on when praising the second season, but one that Ms. Davis and Ms. Bish\u00e9 play down.Ms. Davis said the show has never emphasized the characters\u2019 gender. \u201cIt comes up, but the Chrises [Mr. Rogers and Mr. Cantwell] are more interested in what it\u2019s like for entrepreneurs and idealists and ambitious people to succeed greatly and to fail greatly rather than focusing on the fact that they\u2019re women.\u201dMs. Bish\u00e9 added, \u201cMackenzie and I are of the mind that we treat these characters as people first, and whatever conclusion an audience draws about them being women is almost incidental.\u201dThe new season follows Mutiny\u2019s expansion from a dial-up service, which had to lease server space, to a 100,000-user community with its own mainframe. And while it is set in 1986, the issues \u2014 online privacy, technology creeping into people\u2019s daily lives, even recreational marijuana use \u2014 are strikingly contemporary.\u201cI.P.O. culture and the way Silicon Valley is with money and the progression of women in power are certainly in the ether right now,\u201d Ms. Davis said.AMC\u2019s \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d which ended in 2013, grew over time as viewers found earlier seasons of the series on Netflix, caught up and came back to AMC for later seasons. Streaming services have created a new revenue stream for networks like AMC, but the idea that Netflix viewers would come back to AMC for new seasons of shows has not borne out.\u201cEven with the emergence of Netflix, Hulu and Amazon, season-to-season growth is a real rarity,\u201d said Joel Stillerman, president of original programming and development for AMC. \u201cThere is a tiny handful of shows launched in the era of streaming video that have had season-to-season growth. \u2018Breaking Bad\u2019 was perfectly timed to take advantage of the emergence of Netflix, but it has not worked out that having a show on Netflix leads to bigger ratings.\u201dHBO\u2019s \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d lampoons the arrogant grandeur of today\u2019s tech industry, and shows like USA\u2019s \u201cMr. Robot\u201d and Netflix\u2019s \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d examine the darker aspects of tech in our lives. But in continuing to reinvent itself, \u201cHalt and Catch Fire\u201d is a stripped-down exploration of those ideas that began in the 1980s.\u201cThere were major players in Silicon Valley by that time,\u201d Mr. Cantwell said. \u201cOur characters are coming into that as the new kids on the block. They think they can play in the big leagues now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": " PAID FOR AND POSTED BY Yet, during a week\u2019s worth of shark shows on the Discovery Channel, Molesworth was drawn to a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts ad that featured a guy in a shark costume asking viewers to post photos on social media. Molesworth went out and bought a half-dozen doughnuts before posting a photo of herself indulging in a doughy pastry to Twitter with the hashtag #DDSharkWeek.\u201cI\u2019m not someone who eats doughnuts at all,\u201d Molesworth said. But the ad piqued her interest anyway because it was relevant to people who are interested in the surrounding shark programming and it encouraged them to actually engage with the commercial\u2019s content.Despite the fear among major network execs and marketers that TV viewership is dying, people are still watching TV. In fact, although TV watching is slowly declining, American adults still watch an average of over five hours each day, according to Nielsen Research. But there is a more pressing threat for advertisers: Consumers have changed the way they watch TV. People increasingly are using streaming services and other technologies to skip or ignore the 30-second commercial that has become the cornerstone of TV advertising since Bulova aired the first paid spot in 1941. When it comes to skipping video advertisements, 29 percent report that they do so because they are simply not interested in the product, according to a recent survey by Adobe Digital Insights, the research arm of Adobe.These trends have made it clear that advertisers must find other ways to get their message through to consumers. As a result, companies are making ads that are more relevant to consumers and more effective for marketers.Campbell Foster, director of product marketing at the technology company Adobe, said companies are urgently trying to find ways to reach ad-adverse viewers with fun, creative and personalized content.What\u2019s one big way in which TV advertisers are trying to reach consumers who are increasingly avoiding commercials? They\u2019re working harder to make sure their ads are more relevant to specific groups of people so that they\u2019re reaching the viewers who are most likely to be interested in their brands and/or products. In fact, they\u2019re using the very same digital technologies that are changing viewing habits to target consumers \u2013 just like they do online. For instance, some set-top boxes have Internet-like targeting capabilities that give advertisers the data they need to focus their ads on specific demographics.Here\u2019s how it works: Companies target audiences, using variables such as income, ethnicity and household size. Then, they work with cable providers to make sure their ads go to those so-called \u201caddressable\u201d homes in their target.This is a growing area for advertisers. Last year, set-top boxes representing about a third of American households were \u201chousehold addressable.\u201dIn theory, this technology gives advertisers the chance to show ads that are more relevant to customers. For instance, when a car company did an addressable TV ad for its luxury sedan, it combined sales and other data to choose 1.7 million households \u2014 ones that had a car-buying rate of 60 percent higher than the general population \u2014 to view the ads.The ad worked. The car-buying rate for those households was more than 60 percent higher than that of a demographically similar group who did not see the ads. These advancements in digital marketing have enabled advertisers to do a better job of targeting their ads, and consumers have noticed. Another survey by Adobe Digital Insights revealed that 46 percent of consumers think that advertisers have gotten better over the past two years at showing ads that are valuable or compelling.Even when marketers aren\u2019t able to target a specific group with their ads, they\u2019re making sure the content of their commercials is generally more engaging to viewers. Some are integrating their brand and products \u2013 and sometimes the commercials themselves \u2013 into regular programming. In a unique move, Pepsi struck a deal with Fox last season to give its flagship drink a starring, repeat role in a three-episode plot of the popular prime-time drama Empire. As part of the story line, a character on the show participated in a competition before landing an endorsement deal with Pepsi.The deal included a commercial that played off of the story line, starring the singing character drinking a soda in a New York City subway on his way to perform at a concert.S. Adam Brasel, an associate professor of marketing at Boston College, said that this is an example of smart marketers knowing that it\u2019s necessary to look for seamless, relevant ways to integrate their brands into programming. Viewers will be turned off otherwise, he said.\u201cYou don\u2019t want viewers to feel like they\u2019re being beat over the head with advertising,\u201d Brasel said.Other companies are making TV commercials that are more like entertainment \u2014 and less like advertising \u2014 with the same high-quality production and celebrity-headlined experiences that draw viewers to traditional TV programming.Among the other major differences in this new brand of ad: They\u2019re designed to just bring overall brand awareness. In fact, the ads don\u2019t always have a direct connection to the company\u2019s products. And in most cases, they\u2019re designed to hold viewers\u2019 attention much longer than 30 seconds.For example, GRAMMY Awards viewers last year got treated to a live, four-minute Imagine Dragons performance during a commercial break. The rock band\u2019s performance was a TV ad by Target Corp., but it didn\u2019t promote any products.And earlier this year, Target produced a similar ad, featuring singer Gwen Stefani. The ad, which aired during a four-minute commercial break, was the first music video created live on TV.Still, other companies are making their content more entertaining by actually getting consumers to engage with the ad. They\u2019re doing this with more cross-channel promotions that include several different platforms, including TV and social media, to engage viewers on all of their screens. The Dunkin\u2019 Donuts ad is an example of this.This is smart for advertisers. It\u2019s an opportunity to reach the growing number of viewers who are distracted while commercials are on because they\u2019re using multiple devices while watching TV. In fact, according to the Deloitte Digital Democracy Survey, Millennials are doing an average of four additional activities while watching TV, including surfing the web, text-messaging and checking social media.\u201cEveryone\u2019s media multi-tasking these days,\u201d Brasel said. \u201cEveryone is watching TV and having their smartphone or computer out.\u201dTV advertising is starting to look more like web advertising, with more advanced software and data-mining technology that affords advertisers the ability to tailor ads to a more specific group of customers. And by all accounts, it will continue to move in that direction.As the way people view TV continues to shift, experts say it will be more imperative for advertisers to continue to work to reach the best customers for their products on any screen the consumers are watching.Indeed, the youngest generations of viewers \u2013 and consumers \u2013 continue to change their viewing patterns. The Deloitte survey found that 19-to-32-year-olds estimate that they spend more of their TV content time watching streaming video than watching live programming. And that time spent watching commercial-free subscription services over live TV is only expected to increase.Advertisers that want to reach their customers will have to continue to think of creative ways to get their brand messages in front of them. For TV viewers, that will mean more advertising that is fun and entertaining, not to mention more likely to be the products, services and brands that they already like. In the long run, experts say the change will make advertising more enjoyable for viewers.Source: Adobe Digital InsightsThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "Ang Lee Is Embracing a Faster Film Format. Can Theaters Keep Up?", "Date": "2016-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter a four-year absence from theaters, Ang Lee will return this fall with a searing film about young American war heroes that may land him in the Oscar race. But the movie, billed as a cinematic leap forward because of the digitally radical way it was shot, has faced a major question.At the very least, New Yorkers will.It may sound like techno-babble, but Mr. Lee\u2019s blend of visual formats is a major departure for movie exhibition, particularly when it comes to the speed. Films have been presented almost exclusively at 24 frames a second since the 1920s. To a degree, that rate gives cinema its otherworldly quality \u2014 the blur when cameras pan from side to side, for instance.\u201cI thought Billy\u2019s journey, which is both intimate and epic, and told almost entirely from his point of view, lent itself particularly well to the emotion and intensity that this new approach fosters,\u201d Mr. Lee said in a statement. He added that technology \u201cshould always be in service of artistic expression, to make it strong and fresh, because story and drama matter most.\u201dMarc Platt, one of the film\u2019s producers, said in an email that \u201cmovies today need to give audiences compelling reasons to escape their devices, and that means taking risks.\u201dIt is expected that the specially outfitted theater, which is at AMC Lincoln Square, will play \u201cBilly Lynn\u2019s Long Halftime Walk\u201d when the film begins its theatrical run shortly after the end of the New York Film Festival. Moviegoers elsewhere will have to make do with whatever local multiplexes can provide. There are theaters, for instance, that can play a movie at 120 frames a second, though not in 3-D. Even Imax theaters can play 3-D movies only at a maximum of 60 frames a second. (Regardless of the setup, it will look sharper than a standard movie.)Kent Jones, the event\u2019s director, said in a statement that Mr. Lee\u2019s film \u201cmoved me deeply \u2014 in the grandest way, as a story of America in the years after the invasion of Iraq, and on the most intimate person-to-person wavelength.\u201dIn a phone interview, Mr. Jones added: \u201cWe are used to seeing 3-D used to focus on spectacle. This is precisely the opposite. It\u2019s all about the faces, the smallest emotional shifts.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Subscribe and Save on Amazon? Don\u2019t Count on It", "Date": "2016-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixWHAT do subscriptions to a newspaper, magazine or Netflix account have in common? Once you sign up, you expect to pay the same rate every month.I learned this the hard way while reviewing an email summary of my Amazon subscriptions. A pack of lint rollers that I had subscribed to for more than two years recently jumped to $18.04 a pack, up from $12.44 since the last delivery a few months ago, or almost a 50 percent increase.Amazon declined to comment. The company emails people 10 days before a recurring subscription delivery, when it informs customers of a new price of their item so they can change or skip the order.Any sticker shock, analysts said, may be the result of Amazon\u2019s complex pricing system coming into conflict with consumer expectations of a traditional subscription.Jared Wiesel, a partner at Revenue Analytics, a pricing and sales consulting firm, said of Amazon, \u201cI think they\u2019ve violated the psychological concept of a subscription with their customers in changing prices like this. When people think of a subscription, they think of locking in a set cadence of receiving a good.\u201dAmazon\u2019s dynamic pricing system, in which it frequently adjusts item prices based on a sophisticated set of variables like supply and demand, time of day and prices offered by competitors, is the company\u2019s way of making it look as if you are always getting the best deal, Mr. Wiesel said.Prices of goods can also fall, of course. But even when prices decline, people need to beware because Amazon\u2019s pricing tends to fluctuate more widely and more frequently than at your local grocery store or Walmart, Mr. Wiesel added. In traditional retail, the major price changes typically happen during promotions, he said.Prices of most items, including dishwasher soap and toilet bowl cleaner, changed frequently. As often as weekly, prices rose, dipped and rose again like a roller coaster. In extreme cases, prices for items like instant coffee and napkins jumped between 90 and 170 percent. (Prices below reflect subscription discounts.)\u2022 Folgers Coffee, 30.5-Ounce Tub\u2022 Vanity Fair Napkins______Only five of the Subscribe & Save items held steady.\u2022 Sparkle Paper Towels\u2022 Death Wish CoffeeAfter the service\u2019s 5 percent discount, the paper towels cost $24.69 and the coffee cost $18.99. Not bad.______In the end, whether you save money depends on when your subscription order is placed and what items you buy. The downside of buying through Amazon\u2019s subscription program is the lack of predictability, Mr. Wiesel said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen this type of price fluctuation in a brick-and-mortar store,\u201d he added. Some highlights over the last six months (with subscription discounts applied):\u2022 GermGuardian Air Purifier Replacement Filter\u2022 Honeywell Humidifier Replacement Filter\u2022 Lysol Disinfecting Wipes (3-Pack)______Mr. Wiesel noted that it would be tough for Amazon to revise its subscription program to offer items at fixed rates. A majority of sales on Amazon are one-time purchases, and dynamic pricing is fundamental to how the company operates. If, for example, Subscribe & Save prices remained static, those customers could miss out when prices go down for one-time purchases of the same products.If you truly want to save money on Amazon, one approach is to sign up for price alerts on Camel Camel Camel to get an email when a price drops to a desired amount. When that happens, manually reorder \u2014 yes, that\u2019s an extra step \u2014 your instant coffee, toilet cleaner or lint rollers.Sucharita Mulpuru-Kodali, an analyst for Forrester Research who follows Amazon, said the retailer was probably pushing prices up to test how loyal customers are to products and how much more they are willing to pay for them. Yet the sharp price changes on Subscribe & Save items caught her by surprise.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem as customer-friendly as Amazon typically is,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s unusual.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Even with an architecture degree from the University of California, Berkeley, he found himself laid off and out of luck. Rather than look for another job in the fields of housing or public policy, where he had planned a career, he decided to take a risk.\u201cActing was always in the back of my head,\u201d Mr. Abdul-Mateen said.So he left the Bay Area for Los Angeles with the notion that if he could somehow get cast in a McDonald\u2019s commercial, he might end up with a bit part in a soap opera, which could lead to a role on a bigger network show. \u201cI made a plan: If I hadn\u2019t done anything in three years, I was going to say, \u2018O.K., back to a job in an architecture firm or public policy,\u2019\u201d he said.In Los Angeles, he auditioned for an educational theater group, only to be told he was too old. But the instructor\u2019s husband was casting a small production of \u201cTwelfth Night,\u201d and soon Mr. Abdul-Mateen found himself playing Antonio.\u201cSomeone in the cast was applying to graduate drama school, and I said, \u2018You can do that?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI Googled the top programs in the country. I prepped for about seven months, doing auditions in my living room, talking to the wall.\u201dTo prepare for his role, Mr. Abdul-Mateen worked on his moves four to seven hours a day. \u201cBefore this, I was not a dancer,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew when the music comes on, you move to it. I\u2019m from New Orleans, so I like second line.

Those familiar with its setting are likely to watch closely, given that its Australian creator\u2019s background is so different from those of the characters on screen. Mr. Luhrmann brought aboard Grandmaster Flash and Kurtis Blow to school the cast members and keep the look and atmosphere correct.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t claim to be an expert,\u201d Mr. Abdul-Mateen said of Mr. Luhrmann.The actor has come to appreciate his character\u2019s vintage style. \u201cYou notice how much self-expression is really embedded in the fashion,\u201d he said. \u201cMen wearing their shirts down with their chests open.

{"Headline": "G.E., the 124-Year-Old Software Start-Up", "Date": "2016-08-27", "News": "Supported byIt may not qualify as a lightning-bolt eureka moment, but Jeffrey R. Immelt, chief executive of General Electric, recalls the June day in 2009 that got him thinking. He was speaking with G.E. scientists about new jet engines they were building, laden with sensors to generate a trove of data from every flight \u2014 but to what end?That data could someday be as valuable as the machinery itself, if not more so. But G.E. couldn\u2019t make use of it.But in 2011, G.E. also quietly opened a software center in San Ramon, Calif., 24 miles east of San Francisco, across the bay.Today one of San Ramon\u2019s most important projects is to build a computer operating system, but on an industrial scale \u2014 a Microsoft Windows or Google Android for factories and industrial equipment. The project is central to G.E.\u2019s drive to become what Mr. Immelt says will be a \u201ctop 10 software company\u201d by 2020.Silicon Valley veterans are skeptical.Many industries see digital threats, of course. Yet the scope of the challenge is magnified at G.E., a 124-year-old company and the nation\u2019s largest manufacturer, with more than 300,000 employees worldwide. Employees companywide have been making pilgrimages to San Ramon for technology briefings, but also to soak in the culture. Their marching orders are to try to adapt the digital wizardry and hurry-up habits of Silicon Valley to G.E.\u2019s world of industrial manufacturing.6 PhotosG.E.\u2019s success or failure over the next decade, Mr. Immelt says, depends on this transformation. He calls it \u201cprobably the most important thing I\u2019ve worked on in my career.\u201dApparently, there is no Plan B. \u201cIt\u2019s this or bust,\u201d he said.The march of digital technology \u2014 mainly inexpensive sensors, powerful computing and clever software \u2014 into the industrial world has been underway for years under the guise of \u201cthe internet of things\u201d or \u201cthe industrial internet.\u201d It is the next battlefield as companies fight to develop the dominant software layer that connects the machines.It promises to be a huge market for new products, improved service and efficiency gains in industries like energy, transportation and health care. By 2020, the industrial internet market will reach $225 billion, G.E. executives predicted in a recent meeting with analysts.So far, a major application has been predictive maintenance. Software analyzes the data generated by a machine to identify early warning signals that it needs repair, before it breaks down.The data volumes are exploding as machines new and old spawn sensors. By 2020, G.E. estimates that the data flowing off its machines in use will jump a hundredfold. That should enable far more detailed analysis, giving G.E. a chance to sell its customers not machines but \u201cbusiness outcomes,\u201d like fuel savings. Mr. Immelt sees this as a move up the industrial food chain.Yet all of this exposes G.E. to new competition beyond its traditional rivals like Rockwell Automation, Siemens and United Technologies. Tech giants, including Amazon, Cisco, Google, IBM and Microsoft also have their eye on the industrial internet market, as do a bevy of start-ups.There is precedent for trouble in other industries, of course. Google and Facebook transformed media and advertising, Amazon redefined retailing, and Uber applied an entirely new business model to taxis, which hadn\u2019t changed much in generations.\u201cThe real danger is that the data and analysis becomes worth more than the installed equipment itself,\u201d said Karim R. Lakhani, a professor at the Harvard Business School. \u201cG.E. has no choice but to try to do that itself.\u201dUntil this year, Darren Haas hadn\u2019t thought about G.E., certainly not working there. To him, G.E. meant little more than than kitchen appliances and light bulbs. \u201cI had no idea,\u201d Mr. Haas said.But he was intrigued after he met with Harel Kodesh, an expert in mobile and cloud computing who led teams at Microsoft and VMware, a maker of data-center software. Less than two years ago, Mr. Kodesh joined G.E., and he is now chief technology officer of GE Digital.That someone of Mr. Kodesh\u2019s caliber was a G.E. convert got Mr. Haas\u2019s attention. Then, Mr. Haas started grasping the role that G.E. equipment plays across the economy \u2014 in transportation, in hospitals \u2014 \u201ca whole world,\u201d he said. \u201cI found that really, really compelling.\u201dThe other thing Mr. Haas, 41, found appealing was the big computing challenge that lies ahead for the company. In May, he joined G.E. from Apple, where he was a member of the founding team at Siri, the voice-based digital assistant start-up Apple acquired in 2010. When he left Apple, Mr. Haas was head of cloud engineering, managing the computing engine behind Siri, iTunes and iCloud.At GE Digital, Mr. Haas has a similar title, head of platform cloud engineering, but in a different setting. He describes his job as applying modern software technology \u2014 machine learning, artificial intelligence and cloud computing \u2014 to the industrial arena. \u201cI\u2019ve got my work cut out for me,\u201d he said.Mr. Haas is working on the centerpiece of G.E.\u2019s software strategy, a product called Predix. Its evolution mirrors G.E.\u2019s software ambitions.Predix began as little more than a brand of software used by G.E. to service the gear it sells. One showcase use was in jet engines to do predictive maintenance, saving downtime. Around 2013, William Ruh, a former Cisco Systems executive brought in to put together the San Ramon software center, started expanding Predix to other G.E. industrial businesses.But that soon felt too small. The issue was \u201coutside disrupters,\u201d Mr. Ruh said, citing the online lodging start-up Airbnb as an example of rivals that can appear seemingly out of nowhere and that \u201cbring greater productivity \u2014 but don\u2019t own the assets they sell.\u201d G.E., Mr. Ruh notes, is the ultimate big-asset company.The other threat was rising interest among tech companies to take their internet connectivity expertise and try to apply it to industrial businesses. To get ahead of all this, G.E. reimagined Predix as a cloud-based operating system for industrial applications.Mr. Kodesh leads that effort. He ticks off the looming competitors: Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and others. \u201cThose companies are going to encroach on the territory,\u201d Mr. Kodesh said. \u201cAre we going to capitulate, or build something like Predix?\u201dThe basic idea is that G.E. and outside software developers will write programs to run on Predix. This software might, for instance, monitor the health and fine-tune the operation of equipment like oil-field rigs and wind-farm turbines, improving performance, reducing wear and adapting to changing environmental conditions. It amounts to software delivering the equivalent of personalized medicine for machines.Like any other computer operating system, Predix aims to take the complexity out of writing programs, so more people can create them. And while the instincts of the industrial world are proprietary, G.E. is following an open-source model with Predix, providing a basic design, but one open to outside contributors \u2014 more like Android from Google than Windows from Microsoft.Predix, Mr. Kodesh said, will be improved using the software equivalent of Lego blocks. \u201cSome will be G.E.\u2019s, and some will be made by third-party developers,\u201d he said.G.E. is betting that its deep knowledge of industry will give it an edge in this software arms race. The stakes for this kind of programming can be high.For a regular consumer using the internet, a misfiring algorithm in the software \u2014 \u201ca false positive\u201d \u2014 might mean a person sees an irrelevant online ad, or a bad Amazon book suggestion or Netflix movie recommendation, Mr. Kodesh said. Useless, perhaps, but not necessarily costly. But a false positive that prompts an airline to take a jet engine off the wing, Mr. Kodesh said, is a $100,000 mistake.\u201cWe really do need to have different technology, different algorithms and a different cloud, than in the consumer internet,\u201d he said.G.E. has set an ambitious target for Predix. It hopes to attract $100 million in orders this year, on its way to $4 billion in revenue by 2020. By then, the company forecasts that its total digital business \u2014 more than 90 percent of it software \u2014 may reach as much as $15 billion, up from $6 billion now.For Predix to reach its potential, though, G.E. needs outside programmers to write software for it. The company, with its deep pockets, can start the software-writing parade, but will others follow?This will be a major test. And G.E.\u2019s campaign to build an industrial operating system and create a flourishing ecosystem of software for it is just getting underway in earnest.In late July, G.E. hosted a Predix conference in Las Vegas, which attracted 1,200 software developers. Such developer gatherings are part of the playbook of every major software company but unusual for an industrial corporation.G.E. has some built-in advantages. Its installed base is huge. For example, the company says more than a third of the world\u2019s electricity is generated on G.E. equipment. It can make progress simply by winning over the aircraft makers, oil companies, hospitals and utilities that now depend on G.E. machinery.G.E. is starting to attract a developer following. Tata Consultancy Services, for one, says it now has 500 programmers designing and developing Predix applications for customers in the electric-utility, aviation and health care industries. G.E. also promotes partnerships with Infosys, Wipro and Capgemini to help business write Predix software.When he joined in 2011, Mr. Ruh had no illusions that making software a strength at a heavy-industry company would be easy. At the time, he told Mr. Immelt that would be \u201ca 10-year journey,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of that journey.\u201dPart of that is an effort to change an engineering culture that stretches back generations. \u201cIf G.E. is truly going to be a digital-industrial company, we can\u2019t be separate here,\u201d Mr. Ruh said of his software division. Digital \u201ctools and habits\u201d need to be embedded \u201cin how people do their jobs,\u201d he said.In its factory in Greenville, S.C., G.E. produces both giant power generators and evidence that this metamorphosis might work.The three-story building is crowded with immense cranes and milling, grinding and welding machines, overseen by manufacturing engineers and technicians. The finishing touches are being put on one of G.E.\u2019s new gas turbines.It looks like the business end of a rocket ship lying on its side, a gleaming steel dynamo at rest. It weighs 950,000 pounds. It fires up at nearly 2,900 degrees Fahrenheit, and it can generate enough electricity to supply more than 500,000 households.The gas turbine was brought to market in half the typical five years. That kind of accelerated product development is a performance that G.E. hopes to replicate across its industrial businesses. And it is a story of changes in design and manufacturing practices made possible by digital technology.John Lammas, the 56-year-old vice president for power generation engineering, started his working career 40 years ago, on the shop floor of a Rolls-Royce jet engine factory in Birmingham, England. He has been with G.E. for 31 years, moving up the ranks of the company\u2019s jet engine and power turbine divisions.\u201cI\u2019m an old mechanical guy,\u201d he said. But a couple of years ago, he issued an edict: no more paper drawings.In the past, a model of a new part would be made and then converted to detailed blueprints running to 70 pages or more. These would then be physically sent to G.E. manufacturing engineers and outside suppliers to begin setting up the tooling, casting and cutting for the part.This prototype-and-blueprint routine took up to eight weeks. Now, engineers use 3-D computer models, skip the prototype step and instantly send the models electronically.This goes a step beyond computer-aided design, which is commonplace. In Greenville, the designers are for the first time linked directly with manufacturers and suppliers in real time, in what G.E. calls a \u201cdigital thread.\u201d This means they can collaborate in ways that have changed the work process while making it more likely that problems or defects are spotted sooner.Traditionally, one set of engineers designed a part, and only then passed it on to manufacturing. If a problem arose on the supplier side, the design was kicked back and the process started over. \u201cJobs are combining in this digital world,\u201d Mr. Lammas said.Greenville\u2019s own equipment has been a Predix guinea pig. The machinery and factory were retrofitted with data-generating sensors and the software. Matt Krause, the plant manager, said that last winter, when a snowstorm shut the factory for a day, the sensor network detected that the plant had consumed 1,000 pounds of argon, an inert gas used in coatings for parts. The leak was fixed, saving $350,000 a year.\u201cWe can see things we never did before,\u201d Mr. Krause said. Over all, 60 of 200 steps in design and production have been automated or eliminated, reducing work time by 530,000 hours over three years, G.E. estimates.Not all the start-up ideas that G.E. is trying to breed translate comfortably to heavy industry. Lean proponents urge companies to come up with \u201cminimum viable products,\u201d particularly test versions of software programs. But no one wants a minimum viable jet engine or power generator.Yet in Greenville, engineers in the design stages are encouraged to move faster in smaller steps, conduct more experiments, and be willing to fail and try again. It amounts to a sea change in the engineering culture of heavy industry.\u201cAs an engineer, not getting it right the first time, I find painful,\u201d said Bill Byrne, an engineering manager. \u201cIt\u2019s uncomfortable. But it\u2019s been incredibly liberating.\u201dThe old ways, said Mr. Lammas, the engineering chief, had merit. Each step and rule was logical on its own. But the emphasis on flawless execution and perfection fostered a fear of failure. \u201cOvercoming that culture was probably the biggest challenge,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Disney Bets on Streaming, Joining With Major League Baseball", "Date": "2016-08-09", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 The Walt Disney Company, facing stiff challenges in the traditional television business, is making a $1 billion bet on video streaming.BamTech, which handles streaming for baseball teams and Time Warner\u2019s HBO, among others, will work with Disney to introduce an ESPN-branded subscription streaming service, Disney said. Robert A. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, told analysts that the unnamed service would be introduced \u201cprobably by the end of the year\u201d and include offerings like baseball, hockey, tennis, cricket and college sports \u2014 mostly rights that are already owned by ESPN but not televised.Current content on ESPN\u2019s roster of cable networks will not appear. Perhaps with an eye toward Disney\u2019s cable-provider partners, Mr. Iger was careful to say that the service would be \u201ccomplementary\u201d to ESPN\u2019s traditional networks. Keeping those channels healthy is \u201cour top priority,\u201d he added.Mr. Iger declined to say how much subscriptions to the new ESPN service would cost, except to say that Disney planned to use a \u201cdynamic\u201d model, with viewers able to pay based on how much they watch.Disney said separately on Tuesday that operating profit for its vast cable division, which includes ESPN, Disney Channels Worldwide and A&E Networks, totaled $2.37 billion in the most recent quarter, essentially flat from a year earlier. Disney shares fell slightly in after-hours trading.Mr. Iger described DisneyLife as an \u201cexperiment\u201d in the company\u2019s previous earnings conference call. The service, introduced late last year, also offers e-books, music and games. In particular, Mr. Iger said, Disney hoped to use DisneyLife to learn \u201cwhether the technology platform that we created for it would work.\u201dMr. Iger has also aggressively defended the health of ESPN, insisting that the sports television behemoth is indispensable to consumers, and will remain so.But many investors and analysts have remained focused on upheaval in the television business. Viewership via satellite and cable services is declining as streaming options proliferate, and ESPN, the naysayers contend, is particularly exposed to a slowdown because Disney has locked itself into long-term payments for sports rights. Its ability to keep profit intact by cutting programming costs in the near term is limited.MLB Advanced Media has been working to spin off BamTech for more than a year. The goal is even-faster video growth.The biggest contributor to growth was Walt Disney Studios, where operating income soared 62 percent, to $766 million, primarily because of the blockbuster releases of \u201cCaptain America: Civil War,\u201d \u201cThe Jungle Book\u201d and \u201cFinding Dory.\u201d Disney\u2019s theme park business also had a strong quarter. Ticket price increases contributed to $994 million in operating income, an 8 percent increase.Mr. Iger told analysts that, so far, Walt Disney World in Florida had seen no impact in bookings because of a concern over an outbreak of the Zika virus in Miami. Attendance fell 4 percent at Disney\u2019s domestic parks, a decline Disney partly attributed to the timing of Easter vacations this year compared with 2015.Advertisement"}

But it\u2019s also the essence of cultural nostalgia: the longing to find some \u201cthis\u201d that reproduces the cherished pleasures of some long-ago \u201cthat.\u201dNeither of them \u2014 unlike this year\u2019s \u201cThe X-Files\u201d or \u201cGhostbusters\u201d \u2014 is based on an existing franchise. They tickle our memory centers without inviting unflattering comparisons to some sainted original. They might succeed or not, but they\u2019re at least trying to reproduce part of what made us love our childhood favorites way back when: the joy of discovering something for the first time.As Joyce, whose son Will is sucked into a parallel plane of existence, Ms. Ryder plays the kind of single-mom character common in movies like \u201cE.T. the Extraterrestrial\u201d from the early \u201980s, a time of high divorce rates. But her circumstances are a little more raw and dire. (It\u2019s a financial hardship, for instance, for her to replace the landline phone Will blows up in his attempt to communicate.) The teenage characters, meanwhile, both recall and respond to their horror-movie forebears, like Nancy (Natalia Dyer), who has sex with her boyfriend yet doesn\u2019t become monster food as punishment.\u201cStranger Things\u201d isn\u2019t revolutionary \u2014 it\u2019s a tasty campfire s\u2019more, the kind of summer movie that the actual summer movie season didn\u2019t provide. But it manages to deliver on the appeal of nostalgia \u2014 the allure of simpler, innocent times \u2014 while letting on that it realizes those times were neither simpler nor more innocent.\u201cThe Get Down\u201d performs the opposite trick: It takes a period fixed in popular history as a nadir and turns it into a moment shimmering with possibility.From Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cSummer of Sam\u201d to the ESPN mini-series \u201cThe Bronx Is Burning\u201d (based on a book by The New York Times\u2019s Jonathan Mahler), 1977 has been portrayed as the year New York City bottomed out. \u201cThe Get Down,\u201d a fanciful origin story of hip-hop in the Bronx, presents it as the year a new urban culture impossibly took flight.Part of this is the influence of the creator Baz Luhrmann, who has never met a subject he wouldn\u2019t blast with a glitter cannon. The sensibility of \u201cThe Get Down\u201d is defiantly joyous, more \u201cThe Wiz\u201d than \u201cThe Warriors.\u201d There may be arson-torched apartment buildings and gaudily art-directed murders, but the series\u2019 true love is for orange limousines and tight, bumping disco pants.The show\u2019s stylistic pastiche is less blatant than those in \u201cStranger Things,\u201d but it even more forcefully wrestles with the popular conception of its setting. Where we expect to see problems, it sees opportunities \u2014 chances for invention and self-invention, even if it takes struggle.Compared with HBO\u2019s somber and now-canceled 1970s music drama, \u201cVinyl,\u201d \u201cThe Get Down\u201d is mainly a young people\u2019s story. It refuses to be pessimistic, and it\u2019s cast with vibrant young actors like Justice Smith and Herizen Guardiola, whose performances each contain a full day\u2019s supply of vitamin C.Like \u201cStranger Things,\u201d with its brick-size walkie-talkies, \u201cThe Get Down\u201d fetishizes predigital technology (here, turntables and crayon-marked LPs) as a means of liberating ingenious kids. Midseason, the Bronx is hit by the notorious blackout of 1977, whose chaos and looting got record players and mixing boards into the hands of the youth, written off, who will help create an American art form.\u201cStranger Things\u201d is much more fully formed. \u201cThe Get Down\u201d is plagued by a undisciplined ambition to be every story \u2014 melodrama, history, romance, musical comedy, political intrigue. It has electric moments, but only becomes focused intermittently, in the last couple hours of its six-episode initial run.But both shows are encouraging examples of how to use nostalgia for more than cheap hits of \u201cRemember that?\u201d Not unlike the DJs of \u201cThe Get Down,\u201d they practice a kind of scavenger\u2019s art, weaving samples and familiar hooks into kinetic new rhythms.

Can Theaters Keep Up?", "Date": "2016-08-22", "News": "Supported byAfter a four-year absence from theaters, Ang Lee will return this fall with a searing film about young American war heroes that may land him in the Oscar race. But the movie, billed as a cinematic leap forward because of the digitally radical way it was shot, has faced a major question.At the very least, New Yorkers will.It may sound like techno-babble, but Mr. Lee\u2019s blend of visual formats is a major departure for movie exhibition, particularly when it comes to the speed. Films have been presented almost exclusively at 24 frames a second since the 1920s. To a degree, that rate gives cinema its otherworldly quality \u2014 the blur when cameras pan from side to side, for instance.\u201cI thought Billy\u2019s journey, which is both intimate and epic, and told almost entirely from his point of view, lent itself particularly well to the emotion and intensity that this new approach fosters,\u201d Mr. Lee said in a statement. He added that technology \u201cshould always be in service of artistic expression, to make it strong and fresh, because story and drama matter most.\u201dMarc Platt, one of the film\u2019s producers, said in an email that \u201cmovies today need to give audiences compelling reasons to escape their devices, and that means taking risks.\u201dIt is expected that the specially outfitted theater, which is at AMC Lincoln Square, will play \u201cBilly Lynn\u2019s Long Halftime Walk\u201d when the film begins its theatrical run shortly after the end of the New York Film Festival. Moviegoers elsewhere will have to make do with whatever local multiplexes can provide. There are theaters, for instance, that can play a movie at 120 frames a second, though not in 3-D. Even Imax theaters can play 3-D movies only at a maximum of 60 frames a second. (Regardless of the setup, it will look sharper than a standard movie.)Kent Jones, the event\u2019s director, said in a statement that Mr. Lee\u2019s film \u201cmoved me deeply \u2014 in the grandest way, as a story of America in the years after the invasion of Iraq, and on the most intimate person-to-person wavelength.\u201dIn a phone interview, Mr. Jones added: \u201cWe are used to seeing 3-D used to focus on spectacle. This is precisely the opposite. It\u2019s all about the faces, the smallest emotional shifts.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "1.28 Billion Minutes Streamed (and NBC Is Still Counting)", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "Supported byTV SportsSTAMFORD, Conn. \u2014 NBC Sports\u2019 promise to stream every sport live at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro is fulfilled here at its headquarters \u2014 a former Clairol factory \u2014 where the digital feeds from every event are sent to tablets, computers, smartphones and other connected devices. They are visible on flat screens throughout the vast broadcast operations center \u2014 mosaics of sports that are being played simultaneously.Streaming is a part of NBC\u2019s Olympic future \u2014 an extension and repudiation of a history in which the prime-time broadcast was not to be trifled with. But the new model is unfolding in Rio: unfettered live streaming of all events and live Olympic programming on NBCUniversal\u2019s cable networks, combined with NBC\u2019s traditional prime-time broadcast, which has live and taped elements.Through Thursday, NBC\u2019s live streaming had reached 1.28 billion minutes \u2014 more than in all of the 2012 London Olympics. The minutes have helped NBC add the equivalent of a few hundred thousand viewers to a prime-time broadcast audience that has fallen since 2012. Still, NBC\u2019s streaming is less than halfway to the 2.6 billion live minutes that ESPN streamed during the 2014 World Cup.\u201cGoing past one billion minutes \u2014 I\u2019m impressed, excited and overjoyed,\u201d said Eric Black, the chief technology officer of NBC Sports Group Digital, who has watched Olympic streaming advance, sometimes fitfully, over several Olympics. He recalled an unexpectedly large surge of streaming during the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, for the men\u2019s United States-Russia preliminary-round game in hockey, at 7:30 a.m. Eastern.\u201cWe expected an O.K. crowd, but it went viral, and went to a shootout,\u201d he said. \u201cThe numbers rose dramatically, and we had to add more video sources to back it up.\u201d Nearly 600,000 unique users streamed the game, the most in Olympic hockey\u2019s short online viewing history.16 PhotosSo far in Rio, that number has been eclipsed by five streams: two from swimming, the opening ceremony (which was not shown live), and the women\u2019s gymnastics all-around final (1.16 million) and team final (1.35 million).By comparison, the average World Cup game on ESPN two years ago averaged about 900,000 unique users.Chris Reed, a freelance writer and publicist in Los Angeles, said in an interview Friday that he had been streaming gymnastics live in the afternoon on his tablet because he was unwilling to wait until NBC showed it on a tape delay on the West Coast.\u201cTake gymnastics yesterday,\u201d he said, referring to the all-around final won by Simone Biles of the United States. \u201cDo I stay up until midnight to see how they did and avoid all social media, or watch it live? The answer was to watch it live and celebrate with the rest of the country.\u201dStreaming has become an essential way to view sports and entertainment as people change the way they consume media: cutting the cords to their subscriptions with satellite, cable and telephone companies; binge-watching new series on internet services like Netflix and Amazon; and choosing mobile devices for watching the sports that they (or their parents) once tuned in to their televisions for.The NBC building is in full Olympics mode, and not only for streaming. It is a bustling northern outpost of the International Broadcast Center in Rio. One of its large studios is filled with portable announcing and production booths where announcers call many of the sports NBC is showing, from archery and badminton to rugby and weight lifting. They describe the action using video feeds from Rio with the ambient sounds of the venues piped to their headsets. In one quirk of the setup, Mary Carillo calls tennis from the broadcast center in Brazil; one of her partners, Rennae Stubbs, speaks from one of the booths in Stamford; and a reporter works on site at the tennis arena.Black and his staff spend much of their time making sure the live streams run without serious glitches, a task that was largely unheard-of when he began working in the early 2000s as the webmaster at WNBC-TV\u2019s website in New York. \u201cWe pointed a camera at the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree \u2014 it was like Yule log \u2014 and people watched it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you think about it, that was pretty advanced for 2002.\u201dOn a wall in Black\u2019s office is a large heat map \u2014 its colors ranging from pale yellow to dark orange \u2014 that shows the number of concurrent video feeds scheduled, in 15-minute intervals, to be streamed or televised by the NBC networks carrying the Rio Games every day. The peak was reached last Saturday when about 50 feeds were live simultaneously, 40 of them streams produced by the Olympics\u2019 world broadcaster.\u201cMy 5-year-old godson loves it that Uncle Eric makes it possible to watch soccer on the iPhone,\u201d Black said.Although he is a devoted fan of New York teams and of boxing, his job has led him to redefine what his favorite sports are.They are, he said, \u201cthe streams that start and end successfully.\u201dHe added, \u201cAfter we streamed our first Super Bowl, I had no idea who won.\u201dBut those who stream often care, some quite deeply, in a world where people want to be entertained on demand \u2014 and buffering of the live hammer throw or trouble signing on to NBCOlympics.com can be causes for an angry tweet.Email: sandor@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}

Yet investors keep pouring money into mammoth new venture funds.On Monday, Technology Crossover Ventures, or TCV, said it had raised $2.5 billion for its latest fund, which is called TCV IX. The venture capital firm is best known for investing in companies such as Dollar Shave Club, Netflix, Vice Media and Zillow.\u201cDespite an overall level of caution, our investors are still looking for opportunities\u201d to invest, said Nathan Sanders, general partner and head of investor relations at TCV.TCV\u2019s new fund is one of several from the venture capital industry to be sized at $1 billion or more this year, even though there has been hand-wringing over whether a tech boom that had blossomed over the last few years might be imperiled. Some high-priced start-ups have had their valuations marked down by mutual fund investors, while other private companies suffered public management blowups or layoffs.TCV tends to focus on investing in companies that are more mature and have substantial traction in the market. The firm last announced a new fund in 2014, when it raised $2.2 billion.TCV has also increased its presence in Europe, where it has invested nearly $700 million over the past five years in companies like Spotify.Jay Hoag, a general partner at TCV, said the internet had \u201cdemocratized the opportunity,\u201d allowing the firm to find investments in places including Stockholm, Copenhagen and London.Advertisement"}

We\u2019ve seen Goff standing around with Case Keenum, his main competition, but there has been little about how he is being developed. As for the homecoming angle, it received some attention in Episode 2, when the team\u2019s first preseason game brought professional football back to Los Angeles for the first time in decades. But the treatment was basically what you could have seen watching the game on television.So what is the program\u2019s definition of \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d access? Well, we\u2019ve learned that William Hayes, a defensive end, believes that mermaids are real but that dinosaurs weren\u2019t. We\u2019ve seen players enjoy a day at Disneyland. We\u2019ve met the safety T. J. McDonald\u2019s dogs.This kind of fluff is no surprise, since the show is produced in association with N.F.L. Films, the league\u2019s public-relations factory, but it seems increasingly out of phase. The protective bubble that the image-conscious N.F.L. has long kept around itself has begun to leak in recent years. Against reporting about concussions, domestic violence, drug issues and such, footage of players wearing Mickey Mouse ears becomes unwatchable. This week the Rams and other teams have to begin cutting their rosters down to size, and \u201cHard Knocks\u201d will no doubt have stories to tell about dashed dreams. But based on what we\u2019ve seen, even those seem likely to be soft-pedaled.A much better behind-the-scenes football show turned up on Netflix this summer, \u201cLast Chance U,\u201d about the program at East Mississippi Community College in the tiny town of Scooba. The college has made a point of recruiting players who have flamed out at major-college programs, failed to qualify for Division I academically or otherwise had trouble capitalizing on their football talent. The result has been a dynasty, and as the team entered play last season \u2014 the one documented in the series \u2014 it had won 24 games in a row.There\u2019s a quarterback competition in this series too, and it is actually developed in some depth. So are the stories of individual players, who took varying paths to East Mississippi, but all seem to hope they won\u2019t be staying long; the whole point of going there is to re-establish their football credentials and be recruited by a bigger school.The real star of the series, though, is Brittany Wagner, the athletic academic adviser, who struggles, sometimes heartbreakingly, to get the players to take their classes seriously. Their indifference and lack of preparedness are often stunning.Advertisement"}

I fell off the wagon around the time creator Amy Sherman-Palladino left and didn\u2019t watch the last season at all. I\u2019d like to get caught up with the girls before the new series begins so I started rewatching all the episodes on Netflix. But there are also so, so, so many plotlines I don\u2019t want to suffer through again.

The show, a mixture of science fiction, fantasy and horror, has attracted attention for its use of popcorn cinema touchstones.

A combination of songwriting techniques followed, from collaborative jamming to fleshing out demos that Mr. Stein recorded on his phone while working at a synth repair store.Mr. Dixon and Mr. Stein spoke recently by phone from Austin about how to make an audience hear an era and working on one of the summer\u2019s most popular TV shows.

When you got scenes, how much time would you have to turn something in?The score is woven in very subtly.

{"Headline": "Disney Bets on Streaming, Joining With Major League Baseball", "Date": "2016-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 The Walt Disney Company, facing stiff challenges in the traditional television business, is making a $1 billion bet on video streaming.BamTech, which handles streaming for baseball teams and Time Warner\u2019s HBO, among others, will work with Disney to introduce an ESPN-branded subscription streaming service, Disney said. Robert A. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, told analysts that the unnamed service would be introduced \u201cprobably by the end of the year\u201d and include offerings like baseball, hockey, tennis, cricket and college sports \u2014 mostly rights that are already owned by ESPN but not televised.Current content on ESPN\u2019s roster of cable networks will not appear. Perhaps with an eye toward Disney\u2019s cable-provider partners, Mr. Iger was careful to say that the service would be \u201ccomplementary\u201d to ESPN\u2019s traditional networks. Keeping those channels healthy is \u201cour top priority,\u201d he added.Mr. Iger declined to say how much subscriptions to the new ESPN service would cost, except to say that Disney planned to use a \u201cdynamic\u201d model, with viewers able to pay based on how much they watch.Disney said separately on Tuesday that operating profit for its vast cable division, which includes ESPN, Disney Channels Worldwide and A&E Networks, totaled $2.37 billion in the most recent quarter, essentially flat from a year earlier. Disney shares fell slightly in after-hours trading.Mr. Iger described DisneyLife as an \u201cexperiment\u201d in the company\u2019s previous earnings conference call. The service, introduced late last year, also offers e-books, music and games. In particular, Mr. Iger said, Disney hoped to use DisneyLife to learn \u201cwhether the technology platform that we created for it would work.\u201dMr. Iger has also aggressively defended the health of ESPN, insisting that the sports television behemoth is indispensable to consumers, and will remain so.But many investors and analysts have remained focused on upheaval in the television business. Viewership via satellite and cable services is declining as streaming options proliferate, and ESPN, the naysayers contend, is particularly exposed to a slowdown because Disney has locked itself into long-term payments for sports rights. Its ability to keep profit intact by cutting programming costs in the near term is limited.MLB Advanced Media has been working to spin off BamTech for more than a year. The goal is even-faster video growth.The biggest contributor to growth was Walt Disney Studios, where operating income soared 62 percent, to $766 million, primarily because of the blockbuster releases of \u201cCaptain America: Civil War,\u201d \u201cThe Jungle Book\u201d and \u201cFinding Dory.\u201d Disney\u2019s theme park business also had a strong quarter. Ticket price increases contributed to $994 million in operating income, an 8 percent increase.Mr. Iger told analysts that, so far, Walt Disney World in Florida had seen no impact in bookings because of a concern over an outbreak of the Zika virus in Miami. Attendance fell 4 percent at Disney\u2019s domestic parks, a decline Disney partly attributed to the timing of Easter vacations this year compared with 2015.Advertisement"}

This month, it was reborn as MTV Classic, a channel focusing on music videos and shows from the \u201980s to the aughts. The nostalgia baton has officially been passed to the millennials.In its first week, MTV Classic served up Mariah Carey in a butterfly necklace, TLC in silk pajamas and Gwen Stefani with a bindi. It broadcast reruns of \u201cBeavis and Butt-Head,\u201d \u201cDaria,\u201d Ashton Kutcher-era \u201cPunk\u2019d\u201d and a retrospective on \u201cTotal Request Live.\u201d Welcome to the BuzzFeed-ification of MTV \u2014 the music channel\u2019s attempt to reel in youngish viewers by appealing to their sentimentality for the recent past.As a millennial elder, I am MTV Classic\u2019s target demographic. I saw \u201cBeavis and Butt-Head Do America\u201d in theaters. Daria was my high school antiheroine. In my day, if you wanted to watch the new Limp Bizkit video, you had to wait for Carson Daly to debut it on \u201cTRL.\u201dJust a decade or two later, I\u2019m ready to reminisce about Lisa Frank folders and Puff Daddy videos. It makes sense that millennials, the most recorded generation in history, would romanticize the era just before smartphones became ubiquitous. We\u2019re fascinated by documents of life before everything was documented.MTV Classic offers that stuff 24/7. In the morning, music video blocks are stocked with Super Soakers, scrunchies and velour separates. Evenings bring reruns of shows like \u201cJackass\u201d and \u201cClone High.\u201d There\u2019s also fodder for the slightly older crowd: \u201cHeadbangers,\u201d a hostless version of the old \u201cHeadbangers Ball,\u201d delivers David Lee Roth prancing in a m\u00e9lange of sparkly bodysuits, and Megadeth burning the Constitution. The video marathon \u201cI Want My \u201980s\u201d features George Michael playacting as straight, on a yacht.Too bad it\u2019s all on TV. Millennials may pine for the television of the past, but that doesn\u2019t mean that we want to watch it on a television. Our pre-internet nostalgia is a sentiment largely expressed online. We binge \u201cFriends\u201d on Netflix, collect Pok\u00e9mon on our phones and scroll through evidence of resurrected \u201990s trends (Gigi Hadid in a velvet choker, Kylie Jenner\u2019s taupe lips) on Instagram.As a kid, I watched MTV in my older brother\u2019s bedroom, door slammed shut, hissing, \u201cI am Cornholio!\u201d back at the fuzzy old TV. But now culture is consumed on laptops and phones, while parents are watching prestige dramas on the living room flat screen.Die-hard fans might opt to DVR \u201cWonder Showzen\u201d and \u201cDaria\u201d instead of paying to watch them on iTunes or Hulu, but for the most part, the channel\u2019s \u201990s ear worms and throwback fashions are best packaged as linkable conversation starters, not cable video blocks. Post-YouTube, the experience of even watching an entire music video all the way through \u2014 much less 30 in a row, cut up by commercials \u2014 feels interminable. I kept wanting to X out the Nelly video and call up a Missy Elliott track. I did it on YouTube instead.Meanwhile, plenty of pop culture embedded in early MTV has not aged so well. While many of the music videos called up from the \u201990s and aughts feature artists of color, the channel\u2019s nonmusical programming is not so diverse. MTV Classic is a reminder that the MTV of my childhood starred white people: Carson Daly, Mr. Kutcher, Johnny Knoxville, Butt-Head, Beavis, the cast of \u201cLaguna Beach.\u201d Notable exceptions include MTV Classic\u2019s resurrection of the Run-DMC reality series \u201cRun\u2019s House,\u201d and \u201cPimp My Ride,\u201d hosted by Xzibit.In 2016, MTV stars look like Nick Cannon of \u201cWild \u2019N Out,\u201d DeRay Davis of \u201cJoking Off,\u201d Franchesca Ramsey of the web series \u201cDecoded\u201d and Nicole Byer of the forthcoming sitcom \u201cLoosely Exactly Nicole.\u201dYes, in order to be shareable, nostalgic content needs to exist online, but it should also nod to present-day social values.

Mr. Suri, who was born in that borough to Punjabi parents, offered to show him around, even introducing the actor to his family. \u201cMy dad drove a cab, so that kind of made sense,\u201d Mr. Suri said.But a funny thing happened before they could release their debut album: Mr. Ahmed, 33, got much more famous as an actor.Lyrically, Mr. Ahmed and Mr. Suri puncture current events and geopolitical preoccupations with a tart satirical edge and an emphasis on identity, especially the portrayal and perceptions of brown men like themselves \u2014 in politics, pop music, Hollywood, airports and beyond.Mr. Ahmed grew up in London, idolizing American rappers from his older brother\u2019s early 1990s cassettes (the D.O.C., Tupac Shakur) before immersing himself in underground British rave culture, rap battles and pirate radio. He also graduated from Oxford University and the Central School for Speech and Drama.\u201cThere\u2019s a saying: You wait three hours for a London bus, and then three of them come all at once,\u201d Mr. Ahmed said of his heightened profile in each realm. \u201cPeople that didn\u2019t know I was an actor were going, \u2018Riz MC is in \u201cBourne!\u201d\u2019 And people that didn\u2019t know I did music are going, \u2018The dude from \u201cNightcrawler\u201d did this \u201cEnglistan\u201d thing!\u2019\u201dHe added: \u201cWe live in a world where people build up cultural capital in one field and then cash it in across others. I\u2019m proud to say that\u2019s really not me.\u201dMr. Ahmed also laughed off any suggestion that his firebrand rap persona could present a conflict with his role in the Disney-owned, billion-dollar \u201cStar Wars\u201d universe, mocking the idea of a cigar-chomping movie executive\u2019s even acknowledging his music.Swet Shop Boys is less a side project than a parallel one for Mr. Ahmed, with both parts of his career serving a similar purpose in increasing representation for South Asians in culture. \u201cFigureheads don\u2019t solve systemic racism or structural problems, but it helps with aspiration,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to feel visible.\u201dIn working together, Mr. Ahmed and Mr. Suri found kinship, but with enough divergence to be educational. \u201cThere\u2019s this whole parallel reality where there\u2019s people just like you, but with subtly different gifts and curses to their experience,\u201d Mr. Ahmed said of his American counterpart. \u201cJoining those diasporic dots is just really healing.\u201dIn the studio, the pair even found their disparate creative methods to be coming from a similar place of first-generation angst. \u201cThere\u2019s the working-class immigrant in me thinking, \u2018This is not a real job, so I\u2019ve got to make it as complicated as possible,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Ahmed, who obsessively tweaks his rapid verses.Mr. Suri is more prone to trust-your-gut improvisation. \u201cI go the other route: \u2018I should be working a desk job, so let me just get this thing over as quickly as I can,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have to think about the fact that I\u2019m an aaar-tist.\u201dAfter all, he added, \u201cWhat kind of kid from my neighborhood becomes an artist?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Grandmaster Flash Beats Back Time", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "The Hip-Hop PioneerThe Netflix series \u201cThe Get Down\u201d is bringing new attention to the pioneering hip-hop D.J. born Joseph Saddler, who, unlike many of his peers from the music\u2019s early days, continues to work.Supported byHe was Joseph Saddler then, a nerdy high school student who liked to take appliances apart to see how they worked. In a few short years, though, in the hardest-hit part of a hard-hit city, he helped to invent what many would agree was the most sweeping cultural movement of the last 40 years, and then he barely hung on to see it bloom.The four-decade roller-coaster ride of Grandmaster Flash, now 58, is a tale as improbable and as distinctly New York as that of hip-hop itself, filled with raw creativity, fame, drugs, broken friendships, lawsuits and, finally, something like smooth sailing. In parallel with the city that produced it, hip-hop emerged in the mid-1970s as a symbol of urban decay and evolved into a gilded spectacle of consumption. Mr. Saddler, the music\u2019s first virtuoso, rode its initial wave, got crushed by the second and rebounded as one of the few from his generation whose careers are still going strong.On a recent day in Harlem, he spread a wrinkled sheet of paper on the table of a Mexican takeout place as if opening his notes for a lecture. His features have filled out from the angular profile he had as a teenager, but he still looked athletic and lithe. He had just returned from England, where he had D.J.ed for 10,000 people. He was wearing a bright red baseball cap with the letters GF and a T-shirt that said Grandmaster, not exactly incognito.The series, set in hip-hop\u2019s gestational period, has brought him back to the streets and parks where he started, now a middle-aged man straddling two eras connected by a sound that people said would never last.\u201cSo here it is, 40 years later, it caught on,\u201d he said. \u201cPretty euphoric.\u201dHe declined to talk about the bad times or his early record company, Sugar Hill, or the rappers he worked with, the Furious Five, two of whom have called Flash the Milli Vanilli of hip-hop. He sneered at a nearby restaurant called Sugar Hill Cafe, saying the name made him sick.\u201cLife has been good,\u201d he said. \u201cEven during the times that were really tough, I\u2019m really O.K. People poke holes in me. Some people are mad at me, most people love me. It\u2019s O.K. Nobody\u2019s perfect.\u201dThese days, he said, he enjoys being a father, and lying low when he is back in town. The world is finally catching up to him. \u201cYou gotta realize that this thing here, this is the youngest of all the cultures, hip-hop,\u201d he said. \u201cRock\u2019s been around forever. Pop\u2019s been around forever. This is the youngest, so it\u2019s the least understood. But it is the biggest. The biggest monster.\u201dJoseph and his younger sister entered foster care when he was 8, shuttling first among foster homes in the Bronx, then spending five years at the Greer School near Poughkeepsie. There, he got his first chance to D.J. at a school dance, playing Bobby Byrd\u2019s \u201cI Know You Got Soul\u201d for an interracial crowd.\u201cI say the Bronx created it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all played a part. Herc was first, the founder. Then Bam had the most selections. And I just came up with a way to deliver the music, technically speaking. So the three of us together sort of figured it out.\u201d\u201cThis is my math and my science,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m actually readjusting time. I\u2019m taking this break, it\u2019s 10 seconds, I\u2019m making it 10 minutes, you don\u2019t know when it\u2019s beginning or ending.\u201dVoices could now rhyme over the beat without being interrupted by a record\u2019s verses and choruses. \u201cThis was the birth of rap,\u201d he said, only partly overstating the case. \u201cSo this Quik Mix Theory caused the whole culture. It\u2019s scary to think about sometimes. But that\u2019s what it did.\u201dBut first someone had to rap. Flash tried emulating the patter of disco D.J.s, who talked while they spun, but he was too busy with the turntables, so he left a microphone for people from the crowd to talk. \u201cMany people failed,\u201d he said. A local resident named Robert Keith Wiggins, calling himself Cowboy, started spitting call-and-response rhymes to Flash\u2019s beats, exhorting crowds to say \u201cho\u201d or to \u201cthrow your hands in the air and wave \u2019em like you just don\u2019t care\u201d \u2014 lines that would become hip-hop staples for decades to come.\u201cFlash had megaskills,\u201d Mr. Stein said. \u201cHe did a lot of show-offy stuff, scratching with his elbows and behind his back. His timing was always precise. The whole thing was furious energy the whole time. It was eye-opening.\u201d When Mr. Stein later raved about the music to people in the business, he said, \u201cI\u2019d say 100 percent said it was a fad and that it would go away.\u201dGangs ran the Bronx in those years: Savage Skulls, Black Pearls, Black Spades, Seven Immortals, Savage Nomads, Roman Kings, Ghetto Brothers, Persuaders. A group of former Black Spades known as the Casanova Crew provided security at Flash\u2019s parties; they were as rough as anyone who might cause trouble.For Mr. Saddler, the pieces fell into place quickly. He became Flash, from his short-lived graffiti tag, FLASH 163, and Grandmaster \u2014 like a martial arts expert \u2014 for the way he cut up beats. More M.C.s joined, until they had become the Furious Five: Cowboy, Melle Mel, Kidd Creole, Scorpio and, the last to arrive, Rahiem. The parties got bigger and wilder.\u201cIt was the most amazing spectacle of my adolescent life at that time,\u201d said Guy Todd Williams, 53, a.k.a. Rahiem, who saw the group in 1978 and joined the next year. \u201cThey were entertainers. You didn\u2019t just come to hear them, you came to see them as well. What he was doing musically on the turntables was unprecedented at the time.\u201d At one party, Mr. Williams said, Cowboy started teasing a friend who had enlisted in the military, mocking the march cadence, \u201chip, hop, hip, hop.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s where the term derived from,\u201d Mr. Williams said.For Grandmaster Flash, barely out of his teens, the parties where he performed meant status, women and enough money to start a cocaine habit, which grew along with his paychecks.\u201cWe all began to dabble with cocaine,\u201d Mr. Williams said. The money also led to arguments among group members, who complained that Flash was being paid more for shows than they were, and briefly parted with him to work with Mr. Mandes instead. (Two group members, Melle Mel and Scorpio, declined to be interviewed for this article because of their differences with Flash.)The bottom also came quickly for Flash. By November 1983, not four years into his recording career, he had split with the group and was strung out and broke, selling his possessions for pennies on the dollar and making mix tapes for drug dealers in exchange for drugs. Once, in a dingy basement on 127th Street and St. Nicholas Avenue, where he had gone to freebase cocaine, he heard the latest record by his old M.C Melle Mel, \u201cWhite Lines (Don\u2019t Do It).\u201d He smoked away the next two years before landing in a coma in St. Barnabas Hospital, weighing just 118 pounds. It took a decade, and the death of Cowboy, wasted by drugs or illness, to climb back into the light.\u201cAt 23, I was flexed,\u201d Flash told David Ritz, who wrote Flash\u2019s autobiography. \u201cAt 28, I was taking the train.\u201dHip-hop, whose evolution rendered the group obsolete, evolved again, opening a path for Flash not as a young revolutionary but as a keeper of the old tradition. In music\u2019s least nostalgic genre, there is now a place for oldies and legends. \u201cLast week in England I decided to go \u201970s the whole night, and I couldn\u2019t leave the stage,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m just really sure this \u201970s music is something people want to hear today.\u201dIf so, \u201cThe Get Down\u201d \u2014 the first six episodes were released this month \u2014 aims directly at that hunger. Funk beats ooze from the soundtrack; long scenes dissect the Quik Mix Theory; bullets fly across barren streetscapes. For Flash, the series has functioned as a homecoming of sorts, even if you can never return to adolescence.\u201cIt\u2019s sad how people paint the Bronx like it was some kind of O.K. Corral,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it was a city of experimentation. We left no stone unturned musically. Life was a lot simpler then. I didn\u2019t see a whole lot of problems in that period. Maybe it was because I knew how to handle the corral. But I do know that when I came out in the park, all the gangsters, all the gang members and everybody would come to the park in total, total peace. The biggest gangs would buy soda, chips and popcorn for like 500 people. You\u2019d see guys with a reputation for being super-ruthless, but they were the kindest guys to my audience. The police officer would be right across the street drinking a soda, because anybody that could be starting trouble was right in the park with me.

Why not ask the baker?\u201dHis silence on aspects of the past aside, he said he was not bitter about the money he never earned from his hit records or concerts, or the wealth earned by the stars who followed him.\u201cI\u2019m so glad I didn\u2019t come in at this time,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mind spending the 10, 12 years building a solid foundation of what I do, and have people follow me, so that when I got into the lions\u2019 den, which is the industry, I didn\u2019t get eaten up.

{"Headline": "\u2018The Get Down\u2019 and \u2018Stranger Things\u2019 Feed Nostalgia With a Historical Remix", "Date": "2016-08-28", "News": "Supported byCritic\u2019s NotebookNostalgia is too big a force in pop culture to belong to any one institution. But Netflix owns a bigger percentage of it than most, simply because the past is built into its business model.\u201cIf you liked that, you\u2019ll like this\u201d is the watchword of the streaming service\u2019s algorithm. But it\u2019s also the essence of cultural nostalgia: the longing to find some \u201cthis\u201d that reproduces the cherished pleasures of some long-ago \u201cthat.\u201dNeither of them \u2014 unlike this year\u2019s \u201cThe X-Files\u201d or \u201cGhostbusters\u201d \u2014 is based on an existing franchise. They tickle our memory centers without inviting unflattering comparisons to some sainted original. They might succeed or not, but they\u2019re at least trying to reproduce part of what made us love our childhood favorites way back when: the joy of discovering something for the first time.As Joyce, whose son Will is sucked into a parallel plane of existence, Ms. Ryder plays the kind of single-mom character common in movies like \u201cE.T. the Extraterrestrial\u201d from the early \u201980s, a time of high divorce rates. But her circumstances are a little more raw and dire. (It\u2019s a financial hardship, for instance, for her to replace the landline phone Will blows up in his attempt to communicate.) The teenage characters, meanwhile, both recall and respond to their horror-movie forebears, like Nancy (Natalia Dyer), who has sex with her boyfriend yet doesn\u2019t become monster food as punishment.\u201cStranger Things\u201d isn\u2019t revolutionary \u2014 it\u2019s a tasty campfire s\u2019more, the kind of summer movie that the actual summer movie season didn\u2019t provide. But it manages to deliver on the appeal of nostalgia \u2014 the allure of simpler, innocent times \u2014 while letting on that it realizes those times were neither simpler nor more innocent.\u201cThe Get Down\u201d performs the opposite trick: It takes a period fixed in popular history as a nadir and turns it into a moment shimmering with possibility.From Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cSummer of Sam\u201d to the ESPN mini-series \u201cThe Bronx Is Burning\u201d (based on a book by The New York Times\u2019s Jonathan Mahler), 1977 has been portrayed as the year New York City bottomed out. \u201cThe Get Down,\u201d a fanciful origin story of hip-hop in the Bronx, presents it as the year a new urban culture impossibly took flight.Part of this is the influence of the creator Baz Luhrmann, who has never met a subject he wouldn\u2019t blast with a glitter cannon. The sensibility of \u201cThe Get Down\u201d is defiantly joyous, more \u201cThe Wiz\u201d than \u201cThe Warriors.\u201d There may be arson-torched apartment buildings and gaudily art-directed murders, but the series\u2019 true love is for orange limousines and tight, bumping disco pants.The show\u2019s stylistic pastiche is less blatant than those in \u201cStranger Things,\u201d but it even more forcefully wrestles with the popular conception of its setting. Where we expect to see problems, it sees opportunities \u2014 chances for invention and self-invention, even if it takes struggle.Compared with HBO\u2019s somber and now-canceled 1970s music drama, \u201cVinyl,\u201d \u201cThe Get Down\u201d is mainly a young people\u2019s story. It refuses to be pessimistic, and it\u2019s cast with vibrant young actors like Justice Smith and Herizen Guardiola, whose performances each contain a full day\u2019s supply of vitamin C.Like \u201cStranger Things,\u201d with its brick-size walkie-talkies, \u201cThe Get Down\u201d fetishizes predigital technology (here, turntables and crayon-marked LPs) as a means of liberating ingenious kids. Midseason, the Bronx is hit by the notorious blackout of 1977, whose chaos and looting got record players and mixing boards into the hands of the youth, written off, who will help create an American art form.\u201cStranger Things\u201d is much more fully formed. \u201cThe Get Down\u201d is plagued by a undisciplined ambition to be every story \u2014 melodrama, history, romance, musical comedy, political intrigue. It has electric moments, but only becomes focused intermittently, in the last couple hours of its six-episode initial run.But both shows are encouraging examples of how to use nostalgia for more than cheap hits of \u201cRemember that?\u201d Not unlike the DJs of \u201cThe Get Down,\u201d they practice a kind of scavenger\u2019s art, weaving samples and familiar hooks into kinetic new rhythms. There\u2019s no shortage of TV that invites us to relive the past, but it can be much more rewarding to remix it.Advertisement"}

Even with an architecture degree from the University of California, Berkeley, he found himself laid off and out of luck. Rather than look for another job in the fields of housing or public policy, where he had planned a career, he decided to take a risk.\u201cActing was always in the back of my head,\u201d Mr. Abdul-Mateen said.So he left the Bay Area for Los Angeles with the notion that if he could somehow get cast in a McDonald\u2019s commercial, he might end up with a bit part in a soap opera, which could lead to a role on a bigger network show. \u201cI made a plan: If I hadn\u2019t done anything in three years, I was going to say, \u2018O.K., back to a job in an architecture firm or public policy,\u2019\u201d he said.In Los Angeles, he auditioned for an educational theater group, only to be told he was too old. But the instructor\u2019s husband was casting a small production of \u201cTwelfth Night,\u201d and soon Mr. Abdul-Mateen found himself playing Antonio.\u201cSomeone in the cast was applying to graduate drama school, and I said, \u2018You can do that?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI Googled the top programs in the country. I prepped for about seven months, doing auditions in my living room, talking to the wall.\u201dTo prepare for his role, Mr. Abdul-Mateen worked on his moves four to seven hours a day. \u201cBefore this, I was not a dancer,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew when the music comes on, you move to it. I\u2019m from New Orleans, so I like second line. But I thought I was more coordinated than I turned out to be.\u201dAfter spending his early childhood in the Magnolia housing projects, he moved to Oakland. \u201cBut New Orleans is one of those places that doesn\u2019t leave the house,\u201d he said.A sense of authenticity will be crucial to the show\u2019s success. Those familiar with its setting are likely to watch closely, given that its Australian creator\u2019s background is so different from those of the characters on screen. Mr. Luhrmann brought aboard Grandmaster Flash and Kurtis Blow to school the cast members and keep the look and atmosphere correct.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t claim to be an expert,\u201d Mr. Abdul-Mateen said of Mr. Luhrmann.The actor has come to appreciate his character\u2019s vintage style. \u201cYou notice how much self-expression is really embedded in the fashion,\u201d he said. \u201cMen wearing their shirts down with their chests open. You got black people wearing huge Afros, wearing gold, walking tall and strutting and saying, \u2018How you doing, Brother?\u2019 It was a time to be proud of who you were.\u201dA typical workday in the dance studio began with hamstring stretches, many of them the same as the ones Mr. Abdul-Mateen did when he ran track at Berkeley. The key for era-appropriate dancing, he learned, is the hips.\u201cVery important,\u201d he said. \u201cMen in the \u201970s communicated with their hips much more than they do now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Nana Yaa, the main character, is a radio journalist who ponders existential dating questions in voice-overs throughout the show. Zainab and Makena both function as a Miranda \u2014 fiercely independent and all about their business. Ngozi is the church girl who works for a nongovernmental organization and purses her lips at too much talk about the male anatomy. And Sade is Samantha, with condoms spilling from the designer handbags that her rich, married boyfriend buys for her. The women spend an enormous amount of time sipping cocktails in dimly lit restaurants as they chat about rolling power outages, good condom etiquette and men who expect them to leave their jobs and make fufu all day.The five women are all \u201creturnees,\u201d the children of families who left Ghana for the West and then came home with so-called \u201creturnee savior syndrome.\u201d The phrase \u201cto whom much is given, much is required\u201d could be their unofficial motto, as it frames their interactions and challenges their way of thinking. They are constantly fretting about whether they would tip so little if back in Manhattan, or why the \u201cwhite wedding\u201d is considered better than a traditional one.The show has received deserved criticism for the distance it maintains from the side of Ghana that doesn\u2019t yet have street signs or personal chauffeurs. Some of the women\u2019s biggest problems are the usual complaints of the well off. Are their maids stealing their bras? Shouldn\u2019t their neighbors buy expensive silencers for their power generators so the women can sleep a bit more peacefully at night? This is Ghana\u2019s 1 percent, portraying a lifestyle that few on the continent can relate to.Just like the original, \u201cSex and the City.\u201dBut the show\u2019s appeal comes from the ability to turn the same discussions that women around the world are having over cocktails and in group texts into a salient critique of Western and African cultures.Bringing a handsome lawyer from Washington home to meet the traditional West African family reveals the divide between black people in Africa and black people from the United States. The question of entitlement is explored through familial connections high up in government. And a conversation about a particular form of birth control earns a quick and snappy referendum on colonialism, as Zainab says, \u201cThe only time you will hear me support the pullout method is happily discussing the British pulling out of Ghana in 1975.\u201dIn an interview, Ms. Amarteifio said most of her audience outside of Africa is in the United States, followed by Britain, France and Canada. Though the themes of love and sisterhood are universal, she assumes most of those viewers are members of the African diaspora.Black women in Houston thanked her for showing women in natural hair and stunning African clothes, she said. And surprisingly, older women have nudged her to push past boundaries.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely my mother\u2019s generation who come up to me and say, \u2018Good job, good job, keep it going!\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s because they like the fact that these are five young women talking so freely about sex, and there\u2019s something so liberating about these five women. Maybe they didn\u2019t feel in their day that they were that free.\u201dIn an episode from Season 1, some of Sade\u2019s luggage is held up at customs for upward of three months, leaving her without her beloved vibrator. She says she would have brought it in her carry-on instead \u201cif I had known that you can\u2019t get one in Togo, Benin, Ghana \u2014 anywhere in West Africa for that matter.\u201dA later episode has them mystified by social media and its role in a society that is already confounded by the murky lines drawn around traditional marriages. After Zainab\u2019s date assures her that he is not married or seeing anyone, he friends her on Facebook without bothering to hide his actual marital status. \u201cWhen a man in Ghana says that he\u2019s single, it means that his wife is just in another country or in another city or the other room,\u201d Sade tells her.In Season 2, Makena\u2019s African-American boyfriend is upset to learn that her family\u2019s houseboy calls her uncle \u201cmaster,\u201d and she herself goes into personal crisis when her aunt tells her that the family once owned slaves. One episode shows a store clerk pushing bleaching cream on one of the girls, telling her that she would be so much prettier if she weren\u2019t so dark.Ms. Amarteifio is a returnee herself, as are many of the cast members. She moved back to Ghana after attending graduate school at Georgetown, intent on doing development work in her own country. She got a job with the government in development, but her heart wasn\u2019t really in it. Then she fell in love, got her heart broken and binged on the DVD box set of \u201cSex and the City.\u201d Watching it, she said, felt like watching her and her friends gallivanting around her own version of New York City.\u201cThese women are actually very familiar,\u201d she remembers thinking. \u201cWomen I know in Accra, women I know in Kigali or Nairobi or Lagos or Monrovia.\u201dShe has also talked with Netflix, which she said is likely to be the future home for Seasons 1 and 2. And she and Netflix are discussing \u201cThe Republic,\u201d another show that she\u2019s working on. It will be an African version of the ABC show \u201cScandal.\u201dMeanwhile, she has begun work on Season 3 of \u201cAn African City.\u201d She doesn\u2019t foresee the happily-ever-after ending that \u201cSex in the City\u201d had, a bow-tied finale that remains scrutinized today.

He pleaded not guilty.The district attorney\u2019s office contends that Mr. Scahill also falsely claimed to have lined up a Shubert theater \u2014 the Booth, he said \u2014 and to have contracted with Netflix to make and distribute a filmed recording of the show, which he referred to as the \u201cKB project.\u201dMr. Scahill\u2019s lawyer, James R. DeVita, said in an interview: \u201cMr. Scahill has pled not guilty. He\u2019s therefore entitled to the presumption of innocence, and he should receive that.\u201dMr. Scahill graduated from Cornell University in 1997, according to Mr. DeVita. He worked for the William Morris Agency until 2008, according to a spokeswoman for William Morris Endeavor Entertainment, the company formed in 2009 when William Morris merged with Endeavor. He was then employed by the Gersh Agency for 18 months until he \u201cwas terminated\u201d in the summer of 2010, according to Erik Bright, a spokesman for that company.Most of the victims were close friends of Mr. Scahill, according to court documents filed by the prosecutor. According to the documents, Mr. Scahill spent the stolen money to pay off more than $23,000 in credit-card debt; nearly $18,000 in rent; and nearly $10,000 for food, alcohol and entertainment.More than $129,000, the documents say, was deposited in an investment account and used to buy stocks and stock option contracts; Mr. Scahill had lost more than $140,000 in that account in 2014, before raising money for the nonexistent play.Advertisement"}

Will\u2019s friends Mike, Lucas and Dustin team up with Eleven (El for short) to find him and fight a monster that puts the whole town at risk.In the process, the boys don\u2019t just go on unsupervised bike trips. They also manage to hide El in Mike\u2019s basement for days without his parents finding out. Though the parents are loving and generally responsible, this is the \u201980s, and they just aren\u2019t watching their son that closely.There is only one character who could be called a helicopter parent, and he\u2019s the nightmarish Dr. Martin Brenner, the scientist who raised El. He kept her hidden deep within his lab and forced her to take part in sometimes violent experiments to hone her supernatural powers. After her escape, he sends a small army of G-men to search for her.The boys have their problems, too. Will disappears after he bikes home from Mike\u2019s house and finds his own home empty. But the kids also manage to help save their town, thanks to El\u2019s special powers.Permissiveness has always been a luxury \u2014 parents in violent neighborhoods have good reason to keep their kids close. And lack of supervision can be frightening \u2014 when Will came home that fateful night, he needed his mom.Still, \u201cStranger Things\u201d is a reminder of a kind of unstructured childhood wandering that \u2014 because of all the cellphones, the fear of child molesters, a move toward more involved parenting or a combination of all three \u2014 seems less possible than it once was.The show\u2019s references to beloved films of the \u201980s have been much remarked upon, but \u201cStranger Things\u201d also calls to mind all those books and TV shows \u2014 from \u201cThe Chronicles of Narnia\u201d to \u201cMuppet Babies\u201d \u2014 where parents are either absent or pushed into the background.These stories let children imagine breaking the rules, but they also allow them to picture themselves solving mysteries or hunting down monsters all on their own. Often it\u2019s only when the parents aren\u2019t watching that a child can become a hero.America may be especially ripe for such stories just now. As mass shootings and terrorist attacks dominate the news \u2014 and as Donald Trump makes dire pronouncements about crime and crises \u2014 the world can seem more dangerous than ever. And yet from the free-range kids movement to parenting books that promote more freedom, there\u2019s a dawning acknowledgment that something is lost when parents try too hard to protect their children. A show like \u201cStranger Things\u201d doesn\u2019t tell us that the world is safe, because it isn\u2019t, but it\u2019s a reminder that bravery needs its own space to grow.Advertisement"}

The graphic design and music are several levels above those of the cable reality series in this genre. Much of the series was shot in Brazil, which supplies riders to P.B.R. the way the Dominican Republic supplies shortstops to Major League Baseball, and the Brazilian unit captures misty, idyllic images of the ranches where the self-described cowboys train.There isn\u2019t quite enough content to fill those four hours, though. The wary but amicable relationship between American and Brazilian riders provides some diversion. Yet the competitions, including the season championship, aren\u2019t terribly dramatic, except for the somber moments when paramedics have to be called into the ring. And most of the time is spent in endless discussions of why a man would devote his days to climbing on the back of a 1,500-pound bull that\u2019s bred to buck, and trying to stay on it for eight seconds, over and over again. Is it the golden champion\u2019s buckle? Is it the million-dollar grand prize? After the first hour, you don\u2019t care anymore.But \u201cFearless\u201d has one great ace up its sleeve. Nothing looks quite like the slow-motion footage of those eight-second (or shorter) rides. The riders become rag dolls, their bodies jerking and folding in seemingly impossible ways.

{"Headline": "At Viacom, Now Comes the Hard Part", "Date": "2016-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the summer of 1987, Sumner M. Redstone wrested control of Viacom in a hostile corporate takeover that left scorched relationships with the company\u2019s management. Still bitter, executives sent Thomas E. Dooley, Viacom\u2019s 30-year-old treasurer, to greet Mr. Redstone when he visited the Viacom office, the new boss wearing a plaid jacket bought on his way, the Filene\u2019s Basement price tag still visible.On Friday, Viacom elevated Mr. Dooley to interim chief executive from chief operating officer. He was appointed as Viacom announced that the embattled Philippe P. Dauman had stepped down as chief executive, with a severance package valued at about $72 million. (Since being named chief executive of Viacom in 2006, Mr. Dauman\u2019s total reported compensation was $409.7 million even as the company has struggled in recent years.)With a truce declared in the battle for control of the 93-year-old Mr. Redstone\u2019s companies, a harsh spotlight now is focused on Viacom\u2019s struggling business. The company, which owns the MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon cable television networks and the Paramount Pictures film and television studio, has had a nearly 50 percent plunge in its share price in the last two years.This was the company that ignited the careers of Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, brought to life characters like SpongeBob SquarePants and Dora the Explorer and had generations demanding the music videos of MTV.But in recent years, the company has been overshadowed by popular digital outlets like Netflix, Amazon and Snapchat and plagued by weak ratings and declines in advertising sales across several of its TV networks. At the same time, its film studio has delivered dismal results. \u201cBen Hur,\u201d Paramount\u2019s production with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, is expected to be yet another box-office disappointment.The resolution to the legal dispute left investors and analysts with a list of questions about the fate of Viacom: Would the company pursue a sale of Paramount? Will the Redstones push to reunite Viacom with CBS after the two companies split a decade ago? Will the genial Mr. Dooley, who is interim chief executive through Sept. 30, take on the chief executive title permanently?\u201cYou and I are buying a house together, and it is called a fixer-upper, darling,\u201d Mario Gabelli, whose investment firm, Gamco, is the second-largest voting shareholder in Viacom and CBS, said in an interview when discussing the state of the company.\u201cThe main question is, what is Shari going to do?\u201d added Mr. Gabelli, who said that he had met with Ms. Redstone twice in the last 12 months.The settlement, which Viacom\u2019s board approved Thursday night, firmly put the fate of the company under the control of Mr. Redstone, who is in failing health, and his daughter. The board of National Amusements, the private theater chain company through which Mr. Redstone controls about 80 percent of the voting shares in Viacom and CBS, met later and approved the deal.\u201cThe agreement serves the best interests of Viacom, its shareholders, and you, our employees, and it paves the way for our future,\u201d Mr. Dooley said in a memo to the Viacom staff on Friday. \u201cI know we all share a desire to guide the company through this transition in the best possible way.\u201dThe settlement makes way for Viacom\u2019s board to expand to include the five new directors that National Amusements put forward in June. They include Nicole Seligman, a former Sony executive and lawyer who represented President Bill Clinton during his impeachment trial; and Kenneth Lerer, a venture capitalist, a co-founder of The Huffington Post and chairman of BuzzFeed.Mr. Dooley, who started at Viacom in 1980, is expected to work closely with the new board during the next month and a half to develop a new plan for the struggling company. He is said to want the top job but also is committed to working with the new board through a transition period on whatever outcome is best for the company.Mr. Dooley, a longstanding partner to Mr. Dauman who helped create much of the company\u2019s strategy in the last several years, has much to prove. In his memo to staff, Mr. Dooley wrote more than 200 words about his close friendship with Mr. Dauman, recognizing and thanking the ousted chief executive.War has spread across the empire of Sumner Redstone, one of the entertainment industry\u2019s most tenacious titans. At stake are the fortunes of his family and confidants, as well as the fate of Viacom and CBS.\u201cHe is a solid guy, with institutional knowledge, but is he a creative guy?\u201d Mr. Gabelli said of Mr. Dooley. \u201cHe is a compromised guy.\u201dMr. Dooley and Viacom\u2019s new board are expected to try to figure out how to reinvigorate the company and change the perception of its current businesses, without the overhang of the public power struggle that impeded business. That includes evaluating programming across the TV networks, new digital distribution methods, the international business and Paramount.Other options include exploring strategic partnerships, asset sales and other merger and acquisition activity.Some investors and analysts have pushed for Viacom and CBS to combine. Michael Nathanson, an analyst with MoffettNathanson Research, said such a deal would cut costs for executive salaries and put \u201ca real programmer in charge of the business,\u201d a reference to Leslie Moonves, CBS\u2019s well-respected chief executive.Yet other analysts said such a deal was unlikely, as the boards of both companies must act in the best interests of all of their shareholders.In addition, the settlement states that Mr. Dauman will stay on as nonexecutive chairman of Viacom until Sept. 13. He will have the opportunity to present his proposal to sell a 49 percent stake in Paramount to the Viacom board. Yet that transaction would require the unanimous approval of the Viacom board and is unlikely to receive the green light.Advertisement"}

Nana Yaa, the main character, is a radio journalist who ponders existential dating questions in voice-overs throughout the show. Zainab and Makena both function as a Miranda \u2014 fiercely independent and all about their business. Ngozi is the church girl who works for a nongovernmental organization and purses her lips at too much talk about the male anatomy. And Sade is Samantha, with condoms spilling from the designer handbags that her rich, married boyfriend buys for her. The women spend an enormous amount of time sipping cocktails in dimly lit restaurants as they chat about rolling power outages, good condom etiquette and men who expect them to leave their jobs and make fufu all day.The five women are all \u201creturnees,\u201d the children of families who left Ghana for the West and then came home with so-called \u201creturnee savior syndrome.\u201d The phrase \u201cto whom much is given, much is required\u201d could be their unofficial motto, as it frames their interactions and challenges their way of thinking. They are constantly fretting about whether they would tip so little if back in Manhattan, or why the \u201cwhite wedding\u201d is considered better than a traditional one.The show has received deserved criticism for the distance it maintains from the side of Ghana that doesn\u2019t yet have street signs or personal chauffeurs. Some of the women\u2019s biggest problems are the usual complaints of the well off. Are their maids stealing their bras? Shouldn\u2019t their neighbors buy expensive silencers for their power generators so the women can sleep a bit more peacefully at night? This is Ghana\u2019s 1 percent, portraying a lifestyle that few on the continent can relate to.Just like the original, \u201cSex and the City.\u201dBut the show\u2019s appeal comes from the ability to turn the same discussions that women around the world are having over cocktails and in group texts into a salient critique of Western and African cultures.Bringing a handsome lawyer from Washington home to meet the traditional West African family reveals the divide between black people in Africa and black people from the United States. The question of entitlement is explored through familial connections high up in government. And a conversation about a particular form of birth control earns a quick and snappy referendum on colonialism, as Zainab says, \u201cThe only time you will hear me support the pullout method is happily discussing the British pulling out of Ghana in 1975.\u201dIn an interview, Ms. Amarteifio said most of her audience outside of Africa is in the United States, followed by Britain, France and Canada. Though the themes of love and sisterhood are universal, she assumes most of those viewers are members of the African diaspora.Black women in Houston thanked her for showing women in natural hair and stunning African clothes, she said. And surprisingly, older women have nudged her to push past boundaries.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely my mother\u2019s generation who come up to me and say, \u2018Good job, good job, keep it going!\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s because they like the fact that these are five young women talking so freely about sex, and there\u2019s something so liberating about these five women. Maybe they didn\u2019t feel in their day that they were that free.\u201dIn an episode from Season 1, some of Sade\u2019s luggage is held up at customs for upward of three months, leaving her without her beloved vibrator. She says she would have brought it in her carry-on instead \u201cif I had known that you can\u2019t get one in Togo, Benin, Ghana \u2014 anywhere in West Africa for that matter.\u201dA later episode has them mystified by social media and its role in a society that is already confounded by the murky lines drawn around traditional marriages. After Zainab\u2019s date assures her that he is not married or seeing anyone, he friends her on Facebook without bothering to hide his actual marital status. \u201cWhen a man in Ghana says that he\u2019s single, it means that his wife is just in another country or in another city or the other room,\u201d Sade tells her.In Season 2, Makena\u2019s African-American boyfriend is upset to learn that her family\u2019s houseboy calls her uncle \u201cmaster,\u201d and she herself goes into personal crisis when her aunt tells her that the family once owned slaves. One episode shows a store clerk pushing bleaching cream on one of the girls, telling her that she would be so much prettier if she weren\u2019t so dark.Ms. Amarteifio is a returnee herself, as are many of the cast members. She moved back to Ghana after attending graduate school at Georgetown, intent on doing development work in her own country. She got a job with the government in development, but her heart wasn\u2019t really in it. Then she fell in love, got her heart broken and binged on the DVD box set of \u201cSex and the City.\u201d Watching it, she said, felt like watching her and her friends gallivanting around her own version of New York City.\u201cThese women are actually very familiar,\u201d she remembers thinking. \u201cWomen I know in Accra, women I know in Kigali or Nairobi or Lagos or Monrovia.\u201dShe has also talked with Netflix, which she said is likely to be the future home for Seasons 1 and 2. And she and Netflix are discussing \u201cThe Republic,\u201d another show that she\u2019s working on. It will be an African version of the ABC show \u201cScandal.\u201dMeanwhile, she has begun work on Season 3 of \u201cAn African City.\u201d She doesn\u2019t foresee the happily-ever-after ending that \u201cSex in the City\u201d had, a bow-tied finale that remains scrutinized today. Rather, she says, she wants to continue to tell stories about Ghana through the eyes of young returnees looking for love on their home continent.Advertisement"}

Hulu\u2019s other corporate owners are 21st Century Fox, Comcast and the Walt Disney Company.The development makes Time Warner \u201can official member of the \u2018cool kids\u2019 club,\u2019\u201d Todd Juenger, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, said in a research note.The new Hulu service is an attempt by its traditional entertainment company owners to secure their footing in television\u2019s digital future, where streaming has become the norm and competition from deep-pocketed rivals like Netflix and Amazon has intensified. Hulu has more than 10 million subscribers, compared with Netflix\u2019s 46 million paid subscribers in the United States.\u201cThis investment from Time Warner marks a major step for Hulu as we continue to redefine television for both consumers and advertisers,\u201d Mike Hopkins, Hulu\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement.The transaction came at a crucial time for Hulu. The service was \u201cfacing rapidly mounting losses approaching $500 million\u201d a year, according to Richard Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG Research. The investment from Time Warner reduces the amount of funding needed from its existing owners, he added.\u201cHulu is locked in a fierce battle for content with far larger Netflix and a far better funded Amazon, with Hulu\u2019s subbase not scaling as rapidly as we would expect based on its content investments,\u201d Mr. Greenfield said in a research note. \u201cIn turn, the Hulu partnership is eager to find additional partner(s) to enter the joint venture to help fund the losses, which are likely to increase meaningfully\u201d with the start of the new live service.Time Warner said that its TNT, TBS, CNN and other Turner cable networks would be available live and on demand on Hulu\u2019s new live-streaming service.\u201cOur investment in Hulu underscores Time Warner\u2019s commitment to supporting and developing new platforms for the delivery of high-quality content and great consumer experiences to audiences around the globe,\u201d Mr. Bewkes said.The transaction includes no representation on the board of Hulu, which gives Time Warner less say in dictating Hulu\u2019s destiny but also reduces the complicated ownership structure of the venture. Time Warner previously was in discussions about coming in as an equal partner in the venture, according to a person briefed on the discussions.\u201cWe don\u2019t have an active role, and coming in as the 10 percent investor without a board seat, we think it reduces complications around governance,\u201d Mr. Bewkes said during a conference call.He added that the transaction would infuse Hulu with more resources to \u201cfostering competition and innovation\u201d among streaming services as well as traditional cable and satellite distributors.One big concern about the new streamlined bundle from Hulu is that traditional cable and satellite distributors view it as a threat. That could put at risk the billions of dollars that the TV networks receive each year from those traditional distributors.Both Hulu and its corporate owners have downplayed those concerns, stating that it is designed for people who don\u2019t subscribe to a traditional pay television service.Total revenue was down 5 percent in the quarter to $7 billion, with a decline at the company\u2019s Warner Brothers film and television studios offset by growth at its Turner and HBO units.Advertisement"}

He had nothing more to prove, having made two winning trips to the Super Bowl. He was also selected four times to the Pro Bowl.As Mr. Pryce said on Monday, \u201cAfter working so hard on the field, it might make sense to get very busy doing absolutely nothing.\u201dMr. Pryce figured that his football fame would provide a running start, and he already had a little Hollywood experience. In 2008 he sold a movie idea to Sony Pictures about a guy who is struck by lighting and becomes a walking encyclopedia. (The studio ultimately dropped it.)You know where this yarn is headed: Film bigwigs stereotyping him as a dumb jock. \u201cDon\u2019t call us, we\u2019ll call you.\u201d Snickers about a football-related brain injury.But the last laugh may belong to Mr. Pryce.

Most retired N.F.L. players, if they go on to second careers at all, stick with what they know: coaching or sports broadcasting.Very few have enough drive left to strike out in a new direction, something that requires enormous energy and focus and carries a lot of reputational risk. \u201cIt\u2019s true that a lot of guys don\u2019t want to keep burning the candle at both ends,\u201d Mr. Pryce said.Speaking by phone from Maryland, where he lives with his wife, Sonya, and three teenage children, he added: \u201cTo me, at least, there would be nothing worse than doing nothing. My whole life, up until retirement, was regimented with football, and I needed to maintain some kind of discipline. You can\u2019t just sit around watching \u2018Judge Judy\u2019 all day.\u201d (Speak for yourself, Trevor.)He said that Hollywood has definitely not been the \u201csexy good time\u201d he envisioned, although he added that some movie and television executives have gone out of their way to help him. One was Doug Belgrad, the former president of Sony\u2019s Motion Picture Group, who bought the lightning-bolt idea as a possible Adam Sandler vehicle.Mr. Pryce still gets upset at rejection, as recently happened when he pitched video game executives on a \u201cKulipari\u201d-related concept.\u201cI can still see the stupid look on their faces,\u201d he said, his voice rising. \u201cYou fly back home with anger in your veins. And you drink a lot of Scotch. And then you calm down and you start again.\u201dWhat advice does he have for anyone with similar aspirations?\u201cNever be afraid to call an executive,\u201d he said. \u201cI go through studio and network lists and find the person marked \u2018president\u2019 and dial. Remember that you\u2019re also bringing something valuable to the table. It\u2019s not all about them.\u201dWith that, Mr. Pryce had to go.

With his magician\u2019s beard and old-coot drawl, he is a kindly, eccentric, wise man. Climbing through the hole in the fence separating their houses, the Little Girl begins a clandestine, through-the-looking-glass friendship with this dreamer, who tells her of his aeronautical adventures of decades past. At this point, the stop-motion animation enters the movie. Mr. Bridges, affecting a grandfatherly voice, gives the film a steady, warm emotional glow.Even at its most endearing, the Saint-Exup\u00e9ry story is far from the kind of smugly reassuring children\u2019s fable manufactured by Hollywood nowadays. The Aviator entrances the Little Girl with the story of the Little Prince, a boy from a distant asteroid whom he encountered in the Sahara after his plane crashed.Among the many interplanetary travels that eventually landed the Little Prince on Earth, the most emotional involves his fraught romance with a vain, high-strung rose, which drove him to leave the asteroid. When the Little Girl meets him, he\u2019s no longer the Little Prince, but a janitor who has forgotten his childhood. She leads him on a galactic quest to find the rose he left behind.For all its magic and imaginative flair, the story of \u201cThe Little Prince\u201d is not especially happy, although the screenplay, by Irena Brignull and Bob Persichetti, puts as euphoric a spin as possible on events. That tale, unlike the modern shell into which it\u2019s been nestled, is deliberately flighty (if you\u2019ll excuse the pun). It involves the pain of abandoning childhood dreams, growing up and accepting mortality.But the film, as if wary of seeming too spaced-out, devotes more time than necessary to its contemporary frame and not enough to the original story. That said, the framing delivers an unusually forceful and imaginative depiction of a child\u2019s-eye vision of the grown-up world: a fearsome urban jungle peopled by expressionless, robotic beings weighed down by responsibility.Although the message of the novella \u2014 that \u201cit is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye\u201d \u2014 is reiterated, the film\u2019s caricature of the digital age atmosphere is so forbidding that it makes the charming fancies of \u201cThe Little Prince\u201d seem quaint and frivolous. The movie, a Netflix release receiving a theatrical run, can even be seen as an allegory about filmmaking in today (by a director of \u201cKung Fu Panda\u201d), straddling the line between modern and traditional styles and blending the best of both. Inevitably, youth, vigor and technological innovation triumph over nostalgia.\u201cThe Little Prince\u201d is rated PG (parental guidance suggested) for thematic elements that portray modern life as a nightmare that cannot be avoided. Running time: 1 hour 48 minutes.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": " PAID FOR AND POSTED BY Yet, during a week\u2019s worth of shark shows on the Discovery Channel, Molesworth was drawn to a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts ad that featured a guy in a shark costume asking viewers to post photos on social media. Molesworth went out and bought a half-dozen doughnuts before posting a photo of herself indulging in a doughy pastry to Twitter with the hashtag #DDSharkWeek.\u201cI\u2019m not someone who eats doughnuts at all,\u201d Molesworth said. But the ad piqued her interest anyway because it was relevant to people who are interested in the surrounding shark programming and it encouraged them to actually engage with the commercial\u2019s content.Despite the fear among major network execs and marketers that TV viewership is dying, people are still watching TV. In fact, although TV watching is slowly declining, American adults still watch an average of over five hours each day, according to Nielsen Research. But there is a more pressing threat for advertisers: Consumers have changed the way they watch TV. People increasingly are using streaming services and other technologies to skip or ignore the 30-second commercial that has become the cornerstone of TV advertising since Bulova aired the first paid spot in 1941. When it comes to skipping video advertisements, 29 percent report that they do so because they are simply not interested in the product, according to a recent survey by Adobe Digital Insights, the research arm of Adobe.These trends have made it clear that advertisers must find other ways to get their message through to consumers. As a result, companies are making ads that are more relevant to consumers and more effective for marketers.Campbell Foster, director of product marketing at the technology company Adobe, said companies are urgently trying to find ways to reach ad-adverse viewers with fun, creative and personalized content.What\u2019s one big way in which TV advertisers are trying to reach consumers who are increasingly avoiding commercials? They\u2019re working harder to make sure their ads are more relevant to specific groups of people so that they\u2019re reaching the viewers who are most likely to be interested in their brands and/or products. In fact, they\u2019re using the very same digital technologies that are changing viewing habits to target consumers \u2013 just like they do online. For instance, some set-top boxes have Internet-like targeting capabilities that give advertisers the data they need to focus their ads on specific demographics.Here\u2019s how it works: Companies target audiences, using variables such as income, ethnicity and household size. Then, they work with cable providers to make sure their ads go to those so-called \u201caddressable\u201d homes in their target.This is a growing area for advertisers. Last year, set-top boxes representing about a third of American households were \u201chousehold addressable.\u201dIn theory, this technology gives advertisers the chance to show ads that are more relevant to customers. For instance, when a car company did an addressable TV ad for its luxury sedan, it combined sales and other data to choose 1.7 million households \u2014 ones that had a car-buying rate of 60 percent higher than the general population \u2014 to view the ads.The ad worked. The car-buying rate for those households was more than 60 percent higher than that of a demographically similar group who did not see the ads. These advancements in digital marketing have enabled advertisers to do a better job of targeting their ads, and consumers have noticed. Another survey by Adobe Digital Insights revealed that 46 percent of consumers think that advertisers have gotten better over the past two years at showing ads that are valuable or compelling.Even when marketers aren\u2019t able to target a specific group with their ads, they\u2019re making sure the content of their commercials is generally more engaging to viewers. Some are integrating their brand and products \u2013 and sometimes the commercials themselves \u2013 into regular programming. In a unique move, Pepsi struck a deal with Fox last season to give its flagship drink a starring, repeat role in a three-episode plot of the popular prime-time drama Empire. As part of the story line, a character on the show participated in a competition before landing an endorsement deal with Pepsi.The deal included a commercial that played off of the story line, starring the singing character drinking a soda in a New York City subway on his way to perform at a concert.S. Adam Brasel, an associate professor of marketing at Boston College, said that this is an example of smart marketers knowing that it\u2019s necessary to look for seamless, relevant ways to integrate their brands into programming. Viewers will be turned off otherwise, he said.\u201cYou don\u2019t want viewers to feel like they\u2019re being beat over the head with advertising,\u201d Brasel said.Other companies are making TV commercials that are more like entertainment \u2014 and less like advertising \u2014 with the same high-quality production and celebrity-headlined experiences that draw viewers to traditional TV programming.Among the other major differences in this new brand of ad: They\u2019re designed to just bring overall brand awareness. In fact, the ads don\u2019t always have a direct connection to the company\u2019s products. And in most cases, they\u2019re designed to hold viewers\u2019 attention much longer than 30 seconds.For example, GRAMMY Awards viewers last year got treated to a live, four-minute Imagine Dragons performance during a commercial break. The rock band\u2019s performance was a TV ad by Target Corp., but it didn\u2019t promote any products.And earlier this year, Target produced a similar ad, featuring singer Gwen Stefani. The ad, which aired during a four-minute commercial break, was the first music video created live on TV.Still, other companies are making their content more entertaining by actually getting consumers to engage with the ad. They\u2019re doing this with more cross-channel promotions that include several different platforms, including TV and social media, to engage viewers on all of their screens. The Dunkin\u2019 Donuts ad is an example of this.This is smart for advertisers. It\u2019s an opportunity to reach the growing number of viewers who are distracted while commercials are on because they\u2019re using multiple devices while watching TV. In fact, according to the Deloitte Digital Democracy Survey, Millennials are doing an average of four additional activities while watching TV, including surfing the web, text-messaging and checking social media.\u201cEveryone\u2019s media multi-tasking these days,\u201d Brasel said. \u201cEveryone is watching TV and having their smartphone or computer out.\u201dTV advertising is starting to look more like web advertising, with more advanced software and data-mining technology that affords advertisers the ability to tailor ads to a more specific group of customers. And by all accounts, it will continue to move in that direction.As the way people view TV continues to shift, experts say it will be more imperative for advertisers to continue to work to reach the best customers for their products on any screen the consumers are watching.Indeed, the youngest generations of viewers \u2013 and consumers \u2013 continue to change their viewing patterns. The Deloitte survey found that 19-to-32-year-olds estimate that they spend more of their TV content time watching streaming video than watching live programming. And that time spent watching commercial-free subscription services over live TV is only expected to increase.Advertisers that want to reach their customers will have to continue to think of creative ways to get their brand messages in front of them. For TV viewers, that will mean more advertising that is fun and entertaining, not to mention more likely to be the products, services and brands that they already like. In the long run, experts say the change will make advertising more enjoyable for viewers.Source: Adobe Digital InsightsThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}

{"Headline": "At Viacom, Now Comes the Hard Part", "Date": "2016-08-19", "News": "Supported byIn the summer of 1987, Sumner M. Redstone wrested control of Viacom in a hostile corporate takeover that left scorched relationships with the company\u2019s management. Still bitter, executives sent Thomas E. Dooley, Viacom\u2019s 30-year-old treasurer, to greet Mr. Redstone when he visited the Viacom office, the new boss wearing a plaid jacket bought on his way, the Filene\u2019s Basement price tag still visible.On Friday, Viacom elevated Mr. Dooley to interim chief executive from chief operating officer. He was appointed as Viacom announced that the embattled Philippe P. Dauman had stepped down as chief executive, with a severance package valued at about $72 million. (Since being named chief executive of Viacom in 2006, Mr. Dauman\u2019s total reported compensation was $409.7 million even as the company has struggled in recent years.)With a truce declared in the battle for control of the 93-year-old Mr. Redstone\u2019s companies, a harsh spotlight now is focused on Viacom\u2019s struggling business. The company, which owns the MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon cable television networks and the Paramount Pictures film and television studio, has had a nearly 50 percent plunge in its share price in the last two years.This was the company that ignited the careers of Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, brought to life characters like SpongeBob SquarePants and Dora the Explorer and had generations demanding the music videos of MTV.But in recent years, the company has been overshadowed by popular digital outlets like Netflix, Amazon and Snapchat and plagued by weak ratings and declines in advertising sales across several of its TV networks. At the same time, its film studio has delivered dismal results. \u201cBen Hur,\u201d Paramount\u2019s production with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, is expected to be yet another box-office disappointment.The resolution to the legal dispute left investors and analysts with a list of questions about the fate of Viacom: Would the company pursue a sale of Paramount? Will the Redstones push to reunite Viacom with CBS after the two companies split a decade ago? Will the genial Mr. Dooley, who is interim chief executive through Sept. 30, take on the chief executive title permanently?\u201cYou and I are buying a house together, and it is called a fixer-upper, darling,\u201d Mario Gabelli, whose investment firm, Gamco, is the second-largest voting shareholder in Viacom and CBS, said in an interview when discussing the state of the company.\u201cThe main question is, what is Shari going to do?\u201d added Mr. Gabelli, who said that he had met with Ms. Redstone twice in the last 12 months.The settlement, which Viacom\u2019s board approved Thursday night, firmly put the fate of the company under the control of Mr. Redstone, who is in failing health, and his daughter. The board of National Amusements, the private theater chain company through which Mr. Redstone controls about 80 percent of the voting shares in Viacom and CBS, met later and approved the deal.\u201cThe agreement serves the best interests of Viacom, its shareholders, and you, our employees, and it paves the way for our future,\u201d Mr. Dooley said in a memo to the Viacom staff on Friday. \u201cI know we all share a desire to guide the company through this transition in the best possible way.\u201dThe settlement makes way for Viacom\u2019s board to expand to include the five new directors that National Amusements put forward in June. They include Nicole Seligman, a former Sony executive and lawyer who represented President Bill Clinton during his impeachment trial; and Kenneth Lerer, a venture capitalist, a co-founder of The Huffington Post and chairman of BuzzFeed.Mr. Dooley, who started at Viacom in 1980, is expected to work closely with the new board during the next month and a half to develop a new plan for the struggling company. He is said to want the top job but also is committed to working with the new board through a transition period on whatever outcome is best for the company.Mr. Dooley, a longstanding partner to Mr. Dauman who helped create much of the company\u2019s strategy in the last several years, has much to prove. In his memo to staff, Mr. Dooley wrote more than 200 words about his close friendship with Mr. Dauman, recognizing and thanking the ousted chief executive.War has spread across the empire of Sumner Redstone, one of the entertainment industry\u2019s most tenacious titans. At stake are the fortunes of his family and confidants, as well as the fate of Viacom and CBS.\u201cHe is a solid guy, with institutional knowledge, but is he a creative guy?\u201d Mr. Gabelli said of Mr. Dooley. \u201cHe is a compromised guy.\u201dMr. Dooley and Viacom\u2019s new board are expected to try to figure out how to reinvigorate the company and change the perception of its current businesses, without the overhang of the public power struggle that impeded business. That includes evaluating programming across the TV networks, new digital distribution methods, the international business and Paramount.Other options include exploring strategic partnerships, asset sales and other merger and acquisition activity.Some investors and analysts have pushed for Viacom and CBS to combine. Michael Nathanson, an analyst with MoffettNathanson Research, said such a deal would cut costs for executive salaries and put \u201ca real programmer in charge of the business,\u201d a reference to Leslie Moonves, CBS\u2019s well-respected chief executive.Yet other analysts said such a deal was unlikely, as the boards of both companies must act in the best interests of all of their shareholders.In addition, the settlement states that Mr. Dauman will stay on as nonexecutive chairman of Viacom until Sept. 13. He will have the opportunity to present his proposal to sell a 49 percent stake in Paramount to the Viacom board. Yet that transaction would require the unanimous approval of the Viacom board and is unlikely to receive the green light.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mike Birbiglia\u2019s 6 Tips for Making It Small in Hollywood. Or Anywhere.", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis summer, I went on a 30-city tour with my movie \u201cDon\u2019t Think Twice,\u201d a comedy about an improv group that has to decide whether to stay in show business when one member is plucked for a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d type of show. At every Q. and A. session for the movie, people would ask the same question: \u201cIf I want to be a comedian [or actor or writer or improviser or film director], how do I get started?\u201d The truth is they should probably pick someone more successful to ask \u2014 I make small films, small one-man shows Off Broadway and small comedy specials for Netflix \u2014 but I\u2019m the person who showed up to talk to them. And now I\u2019m the person offering you unsolicited advice \u2014 so if you don\u2019t need it or want it, this is not for you. Anyway, I\u2019ve boiled my answer down to six ideas.1. DON\u2019T WAITWrite. Make a short film. Go to an open mike. Take an improv class. There\u2019s no substitute for actually doing something. Don\u2019t talk about it anymore. Maybe don\u2019t even finish reading this essay.2. FAILThe bedrock of all good pieces of writing is 10 bad drafts. Maybe 20. I wrote 12 drafts of \u201cDon\u2019t Think Twice,\u201d 14 drafts of my first movie, \u201cSleepwalk With Me,\u201d and worked on my first one-man show for six years. My first five-minute set on \u201cLate Show With David Letterman\u201d in 2002 was mined from three hours of so-so material that I had tried and failed with for six years.3. LEARN FROM THE FAILUREThis is where it becomes important to find a community of people you respect. People who have good taste. People who might not be good at something themselves but know what good is. They might be in a theater company, at an improv school, or live in your dorm. They aren\u2019t the easiest thing to find. When I was in college, every Wednesday I drove my girlfriend Maggie\u2019s Ford Taurus to an open mike at a Best Western 40 minutes away, to enter a lottery of 30 comedians trying to win one of the nine spots to perform in front of the other angry 21 comedians.4. MAYBE QUIT5. BE BOLD ENOUGH TO MAKE STUFF THAT\u2019S SMALL BUT GREATAfter that, I no longer wanted to create projects for the Hollywood gatekeepers. The networks. The studios. Since then, I\u2019ve created a handful of pieces for \u201cThis American Life,\u201d self-produced three Off Broadway one-person shows, toured hundreds of cities around the world, and written, directed and starred in two feature films. All outside the system. Based on that work, I\u2019ve been offered small movie roles by people who work inside the system. Which is to say: Leaving the system behind and creating something of your own may actually be thing that gets you into the system, hopefully on your own terms.The point is, forget the gatekeepers. As far as I\u2019m concerned, what you create in a 30-seat, hole-in-the-wall improv theater in Phoenix can be far more meaningful than a mediocre sitcom being half-watched by seven million people. America doesn\u2019t need more stuff. We need more great stuff. You could make that.6. CLEVERNESS IS OVERRATED, AND HEART IS UNDERRATEDPlus, there are fewer people competing for heart, so you have a better chance of getting noticed. Sometimes people say, \u201cOne thing you have to offer in your work is yourself.\u201d I disagree. I think it\u2019s the only thing.Mike Birbiglia is a comedian, actor, writer and director. His new film, \u201cDon\u2019t Think Twice,\u201d is in theaters.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Baz Luhrmann\u2019s \u2018The Get Down\u2019 Is \u2018West Side Story\u2019 With Rappers and Disco Queens", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the 90-minute premiere episode, which Mr. Luhrmann directed (and, with Seth Zvi Rosenfeld and the playwright Stephen Adly Guirgis, wrote), the result is relatively painless, even entertaining. The colors are bright and glossy, the camerawork fluid, the editing smooth, the cast endearing. The soundtrack is propulsive but unsurprising, familiar hits by the Spinners; Donna Summer; Earth, Wind & Fire; and the Trammps.Even on this smaller scale, though, and working with a team that includes Mr. Guirgis as his co-creator, Mr. Luhrmann has the same old problem. He\u2019s less interested in plot and character than in orchestrating big emotions the way the great Hollywood musicals did. Which leads to a Catch-22: He can get us excited with his manipulations of image and music, but he doesn\u2019t create people or stories interesting enough to give those feelings any focus.That can leave talented performers high and dry, and \u201cThe Get Down\u201d is a catalog of good actors struggling to bring some life to stock characters. Giancarlo Esposito and Jimmy Smits play brothers, an indignant fire-and-brimstone preacher and a wearily corrupt local politician, and both actors seem straitjacketed. Ron Cephas Jones manages to make something funny out of his small role as a cosmic jazz man, but Lillias White can\u2019t do much with one of the show\u2019s oddest contrivances, a flapper-style drug boss who seems to have stepped straight out of the Cotton Club.The young, lesser known performers at the center of the story fare better, though their parts are just as hackneyed. Herizen F. Guardiola has an endearing, believable combination of sass and modesty as Mylene, the minister\u2019s daughter who wants to become a disco star. Justice Smith and Shameik Moore are fine, if not revelatory, in the lead roles of Ezekiel and Shaolin Fantastic, the nascent M.C. and D.J. whose combustible relationship forms the show\u2019s primary plotline. The best thing in many scenes is the comic relief provided by Skylan Brooks and Tremaine Brown Jr. as brothers who serve as a protective posse for Ezekiel.Of the six episodes now being released, Mr. Luhrmann \u2014 who supervised the entire production \u2014 directed only the first, and after the premiere the tone and style shift significantly. The storytelling takes on more of the quality of a midlevel sitcom, or the \u201970s and \u201980s films of Michael Schultz (\u201cCar Wash,\u201d \u201cThe Last Dragon\u201d), and the big moments become increasingly maudlin. For worse and for better, \u201cThe Get Down\u201d probably should have just been a Baz Luhrmann film.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Raising American Muslim Kids in the Age of Trump", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI\u2019m up at 3 a.m., burping my new baby girl, Nusayba, smelling her fresh, new baby skin and rubbing her soft, bald head.Like most parents with young kids, I think about their future: What will my daughter\u2019s first word be? Will she like spicy South Asian food or will I have to shame myself by ordering \u201cmild\u201d? Will my American Muslim daughter be allowed to leave the Trump detention camps if she grows up to be a \u201c10\u201d? Would that make her eligible for a Trump Beauty Pageant?I didn\u2019t live in fear growing up in Fremont, Calif., in the 1980s and 1990s. Like the Khans, my parents are Muslim immigrants originally from Pakistan. My parents didn\u2019t keep their own copy of the Constitution in their pockets, but they were known to bust out Mervyn\u2019s coupons and exquisite daal recipes on command. Islam was a vibrant reality for us, comfortably embedded within memories of watching Thundercats cartoons on Saturdays, listening to Dad\u2019s Jimi Hendrix CDs and seeing my mother\u2019s sari collection.I have now been transformed into a professional adult in his 30s, just like my parents were when they had me. Their generation was forged from immigrant steel and clarified butter. They built mosques out of abandoned shops, drove two states away to find halal meat, started American Muslim institutions, worked full time, raised kids, taught us the Quran and found time to make lamb biryani for an extended family of 12 living in a two-bedroom apartment.I am not doing that. I can barely catch up on my Netflix shows. But I still want my children to know the rich cultural and religious traditions given to me \u2014 traditions that I took for granted.In recent conversations with about a dozen other American Muslim friends and parents, I found a lot of agreement on the challenge we\u2019re facing: Our kids will know a kind of anti-Muslim bigotry that we never did. At the same time, there\u2019s also a healthy debate on how to raise practicing Muslim children here.Hina Khan-Mukhtar, a mother of three in the Bay Area, said the only way is for us to transform into \u201cSuper-Muslims,\u201d minus the cape. \u201cIn America, you can\u2019t be a mediocre Muslim,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to be the best of the best, and you have to show your kids that you have a \u2018superior product\u2019 that you are offering them. There are so many \u2018-isms\u2019 calling for their attention and for their loyalty \u2014 individualism, atheism, materialism, extremism. Islam needs to trump them all.\u201dUnfortunately for my children, I excel in mediocrity. This Ramadan, I opened my fasts at home with a date and some takeout food. I usually prayed Maghrib, the evening prayer, by myself in the family room. My wife, a full-time doctor, supermom and pregnant with our second child at the time, did her best to join me, but her schedule left her exhausted.I felt guilty that my son, who is about to turn 2, was experiencing the most broke Ramadan ever. I wanted to give him the 2016 version of what I had growing up when my mother, grandmother, cousins and I would assemble in the kitchen and prepare the pakoras, samosas and fruit chaat of the Ramadan iftar meal. My father would come home and lead us in prayer. On the weekends, we\u2019d host \u201cmilad\u201d parties with people reciting poetry in praise of the Prophet Muhammad.One potential route in producing \u201csuperior Muslims\u201d is to follow the model of Orthodox Jewish Americans and invest tremendous resources and time to create enclosed schools or home schooling co-ops for our communities.This environment might protect kids from bullying or the task of being a professional Muslim. I went to an all-boys Catholic high school, and I was often asked to be the cultural ambassador of 1.6 billion people, to explain head scarves and fasting. Even though I had to be a walking Wikipedia, it encouraged me to be more bold with my Muslim identity.Army Major Jason Moy, my old law school roommate, is skeptical of Muslim-only environments. \u201cComplete isolation is never a winning strategy,\u201d he told me. \u201cI am a firm believer in allowing our children to be completely involved in American culture, holidays and food.\u201dThankfully, American Muslim kids can find halal hot dogs at their local mosques, which have doubled in number since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, a sign that despite the rising bigotry, Muslims communities are able to thrive in America.I have never been culturally, spiritually or intellectually fulfilled by most of my neighborhood mosques, especially as many still relegate women to side entrances. They tried their best and have evolved considerably, but the hodgepodge blend of Salafism, Deobandi Islam and traces of watered-down Sufism that I usually encountered didn\u2019t move my soul.For this reason, my family and I are spiritual nomads, not tied to any particular institution.We live not too far away and we took my son, Ibrahim, there for Eid prayers recently. He wore his kurta and ran around the hall as the young imam preached about tolerance and requested donations so the worshipers could purchase their own space and finally leave the rented space in an Afghan restaurant.We\u2019re trying to retain so much of the good we inherited from our parents, throw away the rotten parts and improvise along the way. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to start from scratch,\u201d said Willow Wilson, who writes the \u201cMs. Marvel\u201d comic book series, which stars a teenage Muslim superhero. \u201cIn my local community, we\u2019ve been actively discussing creating a kind of \u2018Saturday school\u2019 curriculum, so that kids get religious instruction in a community setting, but from sources we trust and in which we can actively participate.\u201d The sources we don\u2019t trust: shady, unqualified imams and right-wing religious material published overseas.Instead, we\u2019re turning to our peers and our collective best judgment as well as centuries-old traditions.At home, my wife and I now deliberately pray in front of the kids. I prostrate toward Mecca and recite the Arabic verses out loud.Two weeks ago, during my night prayers, my son came up next to me, bowed and turned his head and smiled. There is no compulsion in religion, nor should there be. It\u2019s up to him and Nusayba to embrace or reject the faith and our traditions. My job is only to plant the seeds with care.Wajahat Ali is the author of the play \u201cThe Domestic Crusaders\u201d and creative director of Affinis Labs, a hub for social entrepreneurship and innovation.Advertisement"}
