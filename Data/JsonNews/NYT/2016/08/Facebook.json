But until this month, it was not clear how exactly the group was monitoring its targets, or who exactly it was monitoring.Mr. Mansoor passed the messages to researchers at the Citizen Lab, who confirmed they were an attempt to track him through his iPhone.This latest effort was far more sophisticated than what was found aimed at his devices before. The researchers found it was connecting to 200 servers, several of them registered to the NSO Group.

Together, they discovered that the spyware relied on three previously unknown iOS vulnerabilities \u2014 called \u201czero days\u201d because Apple didn\u2019t know about them and had zero days to patch them.In many cases, the NSO Group had designed its tools to impersonate those of the Red Cross, Facebook, Federal Express, CNN, Al Jazeera, Google and even the Pokemon Company to gain the trust of its targets, according to the researchers.\u201cNSO Group was very professional, and very effective in staying silent,\u201d said Mike Murray, a vice president at Lookout.In recent years, zero day flaws have been traded among hackers, brokers, companies like the NSO Group, and spy agencies and law enforcement networks eager for ways to break into devices.Flaws in Apple\u2019s iOS software are sold at a premium. Last year, a similar zero-day exploit in Apple\u2019s iOS software was sold to Zerodium, a Washington buyer and seller of zero-days, for $1 million.Among the other NSO targets, besides Mr. Mansoor, were Rafael Cabrera, a Mexican journalist, who broke a story on conflicts of interest among Mexico\u2019s ruling family. In several cases, NSO Group\u2019s tools had been crafted to target users in Yemen, Turkey, Mozambique, Mexico, Kenya and the U.A.E.Zamir Dahbash, an NSO Group spokesman, said in an email, \u201cThe company sells only to authorized governmental agencies, and fully complies with strict export control laws and regulations.\u201dMr. Dahbash added that NSO Group does not operate any of its systems and requires that its customers use its products in a \u201clawful manner.\u201d \u201cSpecifically,\u201d he said, \u201cthe products may only be used for the prevention and investigation of crimes.\u201dHe would not say if the software is used by government agencies in the U.A.E. or Mexico.In 2014, NSO Group sold a majority stake to San Francisco-based private equity firm Francisco Partners Management LLC for $120 million.

{"Headline": "Where One Olympic Medal Is a Lot Better Than None", "Date": "2016-08-20", "News": "Supported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The last hope for Cameroon to win a 2016 Olympic medal arrived in the wrestling arena on Thursday night in the stern and determined form of Annabel Laure Ali, a 31-year-old who would vie for a bronze in the women\u2019s freestyle competition. Gladiatorial rock music blasted from loudspeakers as Ali walked to the mat a few feet behind her opponent, Ekaterina Bukina of Russia.It had been a tough Olympics for this Central African nation of 22 million. The news media in Cameroon belittled the performance as \u201cOperation Zero Medals.\u201d By Thursday, at 5 p.m., only Ali could save the country from an Olympic shutout.\u201cI win, I lose,\u201d she had said in an interview about pressure a few hours earlier. \u201cI don\u2019t want to regret after.\u201dFor all their egalitarian aspirations, embodied by the parade in the opening ceremony, the Olympics are a highly lopsided affair. Through Saturday afternoon, the five most victorious countries had claimed nearly 40 percent of all the medals, and the top 10 owned about 55 percent.Most countries \u2014 more than 120 as of Friday \u2014 go home with nothing. For them, the Games are not so much about tallying up glories as staving off embarrassment. And for this sizable contingent, there is a huge difference between zero medals and one.Here is a breakdown of all the medals awarded and the athletes who have competed at each Olympics, starting with the 1896 Games in Athens. The schedule for the Games in Rio de Janeiro and all the medal winners there are also listed.Consider what happened last week with Austria. It is a winter sports powerhouse, but when the Rio Games began, it was in the midst of a Summer Games medal drought.The problem started at the 2012 London Olympics, when the country failed to take home so much as a bronze. The minister of sport at the time, Norbert Darabos, went to England during this debacle and denounced his country\u2019s athletes as \u201cOlympic tourists.\u201d He promised a new law that would focus funding on the most promising sports.\u201cWe have to change the structures in time so that we can win medals in Rio in 2016,\u201d he fumed in a 2012 interview, \u201cor else we will again be on the same level as Luxembourg. They won\u2019t win anything in London, either.\u201dThe upshot was \u201cProjekt Rio,\u201d a program funded with 20 million euros (about $22.5 million).It quickly looked like a waste of money. On the first full day of competition, a well-regarded judo fighter lost in just 27 seconds. The beach volleyball team was knocked out by the Cubans. There were injuries and weak performances. A sailing duo in the 49er class that seemed poised for greatness failed to make the medal race.Headlines at home were hostile. \u201cOlympic Debacle! We live in the stone age,\u201d wrote Kronen Zeitung. \u00d6sterreich went with \u201cEurope Laughs at Our Olympic Tourists,\u201d and got personal and pithy with this one: \u201cYou Are Embarrassing!\u201dWhen Day 13 rolled around, all of Austria\u2019s remaining chances resided with three sailing teams. Two of them came up short. The last of the races that day was the final in the mixed Nacra 17, a catamaran operated by a man and woman. (Hence \u201cmixed.\u201d) Tanja Frank and Thomas Zajac, the very blond Austrian Nacra 17 team, were hardly considered one of the country\u2019s more promising medal threats at the start of the Games.\u201cWe were really not in the small circle of favorites,\u201d Zajac said Thursday night. He was sitting on a sofa on the roof of Austria House, an event dining room for invited guests as well as party headquarters for Brazilians who want to stop by and dance outside to a disc jockey. \u201cThere were three or four favorites and then five or six that were in the hunt. We were one of those five or six.\u201dThey belonged in the circle of favorites, it turned out. Sailing has a complex system of scoring that factors in previous performances, but as soon as the pair crossed the finish line, they knew they had won bronze. So they did something that seems hard to imagine: They jumped into the water.\u201cYou win a medal, and you don\u2019t really care about the water,\u201d said Zajac, 30, his nose sunburned. \u201cYou feel like you\u2019ve survived everything.\u201dThe news media in Austria announced that the national summer medal drought had ended after exactly 2,923 days. Christian Kern, the country\u2019s chancellor, posted an exultant note on Facebook. The pair received hundreds of emails, texts and messages. Frank, who until Wednesday had only been asked about her I.Q., which has been reported to exceed 155, was finally asked about something else.\u201cThe next day,\u201d she said, \u201cwe were on the cover of every newspaper in Austria.\u201dLife for the national Olympic committee\u2019s spokesman, Wolfgang Eichler, has since improved, too. The notion of leaving Rio empty-handed, of another four years of drought counting, was hard to contemplate. A single bronze does not exactly represent a turnaround. \u201cBut now it\u2019s easier to do my work,\u201d Eichler said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as though now is all good, but at least we\u2019re celebrating a medal.\u201dAt the Olympic wrestling venue, Ali was trying do for Cameroon what Frank and Zajac had done for Austria. The match was the only close one of the night. At 4 minutes 17 seconds, Ali grabbed one of Bukina\u2019s legs and forced her to hop backward and out of the ring, tying the score at 3-3.See the Summer Games in a series of composite images.The seconds ticked down. Ali lunged again for Bukina\u2019s legs, missing this time, then dropped to one knee and lunged again. But Bukina twisted just enough to deflect Ali, who wound up on both knees. When Bukina swung around and grabbed her by the waist, she won 2 points. It happened at 5:58.Two seconds later, the match was over. Ali and Cameroon were out of the Olympics. It happened so fast that even Bukina seemed stunned.Ali passed through the interview zone without speaking, looking exhausted and inconsolable. But on her way out of the arena, she stopped to speak to a French reporter. \u201cI could taste the bronze,\u201d she told him.\u201cShe is to be celebrated, of course,\u201d said her coach, Dieudonn\u00e9 Ebouele Motto. \u201cBecause in all our delegation, she is the only one to have done something like this.\u201dMotto was speaking in French, through a volunteer interpreter named Davide Adams, who happened to be from Cameroon. She has a radiant smile, but even as it flashed, over and over, she said she wanted to cry.\u201cSo close,\u201d she said, writhing a little. \u201cDid you see how close it was? It was like she was going to win and then suddenly, she didn\u2019t. I can\u2019t believe it. Oh my God. I can\u2019t believe it.\u201dThe cosmic unfairness of the Games then started to bother her.\u201cThe U.S. gets all the medals,\u201d she said, finding the seam between outrage and amusement. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Why don\u2019t you share?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Paul LePage, Besieged Maine Governor, Sends Conflicting Signals Over Intentions", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAUGUSTA, Me. \u2014 The beleaguered Republican governor of Maine seemed on Tuesday to back off from hints that he might quit in the midst of a controversy over his latest tirades of obscene, threatening and racially charged remarks, as Republican lawmakers in the House rallied to quash the possibility of formally rebuking him \u2014 or worse \u2014 for his erratic behavior.\u201cIt\u2019s really one thing to have one party behind you,\u201d Mr. LePage said on the radio, in an interview that was at times uncharacteristically self-effacing. \u201cIt\u2019s another thing not to have any party behind you.\u201dBut in the early afternoon, in a Twitter message, Mr. LePage seemed to have regained his spirit of defiance.\u201cRegarding rumors of resignation, to paraphrase Mark Twain, \u2018The reports of my political demise are greatly exaggerated,\u2019\u201d the message read. Mr. LePage was spending much of the day in the town of Baileyville, 170 miles from here, near the Canadian border.By nighttime, it was clear there was a basis for the governor\u2019s renewed swagger, as House Republican leaders said they would not join the calls to convene a special session, which would have raised the possibility of impeachment.\u201cWe believe that the governor is addressing this issue,\u201d said State Representative Kenneth Fredette, an ally of Mr. LePage\u2019s and the minority leader of the House. \u201cWe are not interested in coming back in a special session.\u201dSpeaking with reporters after the caucus meeting, Mr. Fredette condemned Mr. LePage\u2019s remarks \u2014 \u201cNo one agrees with what the governor said or did,\u201d he said \u2014 and asserted that \u201cno one gets a free pass.\u201d But he then seemed to give one to Mr. LePage, saying that a special session would distract voters from important issues ahead of the fall election.Since he was elected in 2010 and re-elected in 2014, Mr. LePage has had at least nine political lives and been able to ride out waves of controversy, often provoked by his harsh, insulting and racially charged statements. The outbursts have angered Democrats and embarrassed moderate Republicans, yet left largely unruffled a political base drawn to the former businessman\u2019s unfiltered style.Democrats and some Senate Republicans raised the possibility of a special session to consider ways to rebuke the governor, but such a session could be held only with the approval of half of both caucuses in each legislative chamber. The House Republican caucus held the line after meeting at 6 p.m.The caucus meeting followed days of controversy, after Mr. LePage stated at a town-hall meeting last Wednesday that the vast majority of heroin dealers in Maine were black and Hispanic.As criticism swelled, Mr. LePage came to believe that a Democratic lawmaker, Drew Gattine, had called him a racist, and left him a threatening voice mail threaded with obscenities, which he followed by suggesting that he and Mr. Gattine have a duel.On Friday, Mr. LePage reiterated his comments about drugs and race, showing reporters a binder of people arrested on drug charges and asserting that black and Hispanic people from out of state were the \u201cenemy.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just so nonproductive,\u201d Ms. Volk said in an interview on Tuesday. \u201cAnd so offensive to law-abiding citizens of color, that they would be somehow lumped in with people that are breaking the law just because of the color of their skin.\u201dDemocratic leaders said they would continue to call for the governor\u2019s resignation.\u201cWhat the House Republicans have done is slammed the door on their willingness to actually address this behavior at this time,\u201d said Jeff McCabe, the Democratic majority leader of the House, on Tuesday night. \u201cWe think that we can work with Senate Republicans as well as some House Republicans who we know are not happy with tonight\u2019s display of political theater.\u201dMr. LePage met with Republican legislative leaders on Monday, when he was urged to take steps like apologizing directly to the lawmaker he had threatened, and was asked to seek help, professional or otherwise, according to a person briefed on the discussions.He went on to say that he was looking at \u201coptions,\u201d conceding that his remarks had cost him crucial support.\u201cIf I\u2019ve lost my ability to convince the Maine people that\u2019s what we need and that\u2019s the type of people we need in Augusta, then you know, maybe it is time to move on,\u201d he said. His later Twitter message ridiculed any talk of his stepping down.In the morning\u2019s radio interview, he also defended his comments on drugs and race, saying linking the two were \u201cfact,\u201d and adding, \u201cAll lives matter.\u201d\u201cEvery drug arrest we get the story, and the people, and when it comes to meth labs, they\u2019re essentially all Maine white people,\u201d Mr. LePage said. \u201cWhen it comes to the heroin epidemic, it\u2019s just the opposite.\u201dThe imbroglio seems to have strengthened some Republicans\u2019 commitment to Mr. LePage in some parts of the state; in Lewiston on Monday night, a bartender and a patron high-fived when they realized they both still supported the governor. But it has left those who associate more strongly with the state\u2019s tradition of moderate Republicans, like Senator Susan Collins or Margaret Chase Smith, trying to explain his actions.\u201cIt seems to be the norm now to speak what\u2019s on your mind now without a filter,\u201d said Wendy Ault, a former Republican state representative and a member of the Early College Task Force appointed by Mr. LePage, adding, \u201cI believe in civilized discourse.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Olympians in Hijab and Bikini", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySince I saw a photograph of an Egyptian and a German beach volleyball player confronting each other at the net in Rio, I have been unable to get the image out of my head. Doaa Elghobashy, aged 19, wears a hijab, long sleeves and black leggings to her ankles. Kira Walkenhorst, 25, is in a dark blue bikini. The outstretched hands of the Olympian women almost meet, the ball between them.The photo, by Lucy Nicholson of Reuters, juxtaposes two women, two beliefs and two dress codes, brought together by sport. The world confronts less a clash of civilizations than a clash of identities, concertinaed in time and space by technology. The West\u2019s image of Islam and the Muslim image of Western societies are often mutually incommunicable; the incomprehension incubates violence.No area is as sensitive as that of the treatment of women, women\u2019s roles, women\u2019s sexuality, dress and ambitions. The story is often presented as one of Western emancipation versus Islamic subjugation. That, however, is an inadequate characterization.What follows are accounts by two women, an Egyptian and an American, of their experiences with the hijab. Chadiedja Buijs is a graduate student in Cairo. Norma Moore is a former actress living in Boulder, Colo., who recently visited Iran, where the rules obliged her to adopt Islamic dress codes.Chadiedja Buijs:My parents \u2014 Egyptian mother, Dutch father \u2014 separated when I was four, and I grew up in the Netherlands. My mom doesn\u2019t wear a head scarf and when I began to at the age of 19, five years ago, she said, \u201cWhat the hell are you doing? I left my country so that you could be free and this is what freedom did?\u201dI had a lot of issues with myself, with my spiritual needs and my state of being. I was very hardworking, very controlling. I began to feel that as a religious person I needed to realize that some things are bigger than me. I started with prayer. I stopped drinking. I began fasting. I\u2019d been so obsessed with material things. After a while I became convinced that it would be good if I could wear the head scarf out of devotion and humility, as a sign of giving up some of my control. It worked.Our Prophet says faith is like the ocean. Sometimes the waves are high, sometimes low. Sometimes I am shaky in my faith, sometimes very strong.The hijab is a matter of representation. I know the person I am and the ideas I have. But the person in front of me sees only the exterior. With the tension in Europe, things are worse. In a Dutch village, in a caf\u00e9 full of rich white people, a man tore my veil off. It was shocking but not as frustrating as some of the looks and comments, the job rejections (\u201cYou do not fit the image of our store\u201d).After the attacks in France, my mother said, \u201cPlease take your veil off.\u201d It is my choice to wear it. I will die with it on. That is my right. Nobody will take it away.But balance is important. There is this life and the afterlife. Sometimes you need to think about your spirituality. Sometimes you need to adapt. In the West, now, I may wear tighter jeans, or have my neck showing, or use short sleeves. Here in Egypt I may wear maxi-skirts, long and wide. They do not look great. They make me fat. But, hey, that\u2019s the point! My family here is quite conservative.There is very little religious literacy in secular Western countries. And there is a crisis within Islam, over what it means to be a Muslim. As Muslims we have to acknowledge the problem. ISIS controls what Islam looks like in Iraq and Syria \u2014 religious symbolism, flags, statements and verses. This is real. We cannot deny it. But we create extremism by talking about Islam only through this prism. The head scarf becomes a fetish.Elghobashy is wearing leggings in the photo. I think she represents people like me. International-minded, young, modern Muslims who want to go out and study and work and play. We need different images of Islam.I got different responses from men when I chose to wear a head scarf rather than a short skirt. It created a kind of distance. But I still have my sexuality in my own hands. I can be very flirtatious, go out and meet a man \u2014 but I decide in what mode I want to be. I can be focused on my spirituality, prayers and study without distraction, or I can have a period when I choose to be sexy even in a head scarf through how I act or speak. I feel I have more power and independence vis-\u00e0-vis men now.Norma Moore:I am a deeply religious person. I don\u2019t have a label to attach to my faith, but it is there nonetheless at the core of my being. I believe that God created me and created me with love as I am \u2014 just as God creates every other person. When I put on the hijab in Iran and the shapeless tunics I experience an attempt to deny how I have been made \u2014 an attempt to neutralize me.It has made me afraid. I started this trip almost completely covered by my hijab. Before coming I practiced with the help of an internet video so that no trace of hair or neck or calf would show and make me vulnerable to stares or the humiliation of being chastised. I had come here voluntarily and accepted the terms of admission, so I began the trip in a willing state of submission.But then the weather got hot \u2014 very hot. I got overheated and all I could think about was tearing this hijab off. I felt suffocated. I thought how I wouldn\u2019t let an animal suffocate like this. If my animal were covered like this and suffering I would tear the fabric off out of simple decency.My hair, the curves in my body, were given to me by God. To cover my head and wear shapeless clothes feels like I am pretending not to be a woman and that somehow I am responsible for keeping men\u2019s sexuality within social bounds.I just can\u2019t wrap my head around God making me responsible for men\u2019s sexuality.The Olympics volleyball photograph is tantalizing. The few inches between the women\u2019s hands may as well be a chasm. More than once I have heard Iranian imams, with preposterous certainty, equate flimsy women\u2019s attire in the West with decadence and prostitution. To Western sensibilities, the covered Muslim woman must de facto be the disempowered woman awaiting liberation.Reality is many-shaded. Elghobashy wears an anklet of colored beads. The only colors on Walkenhorst are those of the German flag. Who is to say which of the women is more conservative, more of a feminist or more liberated? We do not know. What we do know is that we need more events that provoke us to ask such questions and discard tired certainties that may be no more than dangerous caricatures.Advertisement"}

Together, they discovered that the spyware relied on three previously unknown iOS vulnerabilities \u2014 called \u201czero days\u201d because Apple didn\u2019t know about them and had zero days to patch them.In many cases, the NSO Group had designed its tools to impersonate those of the Red Cross, Facebook, Federal Express, CNN, Al Jazeera, Google and even the Pokemon Company to gain the trust of its targets, according to the researchers.\u201cNSO Group was very professional, and very effective in staying silent,\u201d said Mike Murray, a vice president at Lookout.In recent years, zero day flaws have been traded among hackers, brokers, companies like the NSO Group, and spy agencies and law enforcement networks eager for ways to break into devices.Flaws in Apple\u2019s iOS software are sold at a premium. Last year, a similar zero-day exploit in Apple\u2019s iOS software was sold to Zerodium, a Washington buyer and seller of zero-days, for $1 million.Among the other NSO targets, besides Mr. Mansoor, were Rafael Cabrera, a Mexican journalist, who broke a story on conflicts of interest among Mexico\u2019s ruling family. In several cases, NSO Group\u2019s tools had been crafted to target users in Yemen, Turkey, Mozambique, Mexico, Kenya and the U.A.E.Zamir Dahbash, an NSO Group spokesman, said in an email, \u201cThe company sells only to authorized governmental agencies, and fully complies with strict export control laws and regulations.\u201dMr. Dahbash added that NSO Group does not operate any of its systems and requires that its customers use its products in a \u201clawful manner.\u201d \u201cSpecifically,\u201d he said, \u201cthe products may only be used for the prevention and investigation of crimes.\u201dHe would not say if the software is used by government agencies in the U.A.E. or Mexico.In 2014, NSO Group sold a majority stake to San Francisco-based private equity firm Francisco Partners Management LLC for $120 million. Francisco Partners declined to comment.Mr. Mansoor said in an interview that the discoveries were a sad reminder that no matter what he does to protect his devices and digital security, he will continue to be a target for companies that provide this sort of spying technology.\u201cI guess I am their regular customer,\u201d he said. \u201cI am the guinea pig.\u201dBill Marczak, the researcher at Citizen Lab who has been helping Mr. Mansoor protect his digital security, said that the surveillance experienced by Mr. Mansoor is likely to expand.\u201cThe targeting of these activists and dissidents is a taste of what\u2019s to come,\u201d Mr. Marczak said. \u201cWhat they\u2019re facing today will be faced by ordinary users tomorrow.\u201dAn earlier version of this article described incorrectly the day when Apple released a patched version of its mobile software, iOS 9.3.5.

{"Headline": "When the Shop Looks a Lot Like Home", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "Supported bySign of the TimesAs shopping online from the comfort of your home continues its unchecked expansion \u2014 almost $100 billion in online sales in the first quarter of 2016 \u2014 in-store shopping is turning increasingly homey. Beyond the physical space, note the proliferation of amenities that soften the pecuniary nature of the retail experience: At one end of the spectrum, a cup holder on the handlebar of your grocery-store cart; at the other end, silver platters of chilled San Pellegrino at the ready. And since nothing kills the domestic vibe like a wait at the checkout line, the final transaction that punctuates a purchase is currently being remodeled. In a luxury boutique, your credit card is now likely to be whisked away \u2014 the grubby reality of commerce happens out of sight \u2014 only to be discreetly, and somewhat apologetically, returned in a supple leather binder or on a zebrawood tray. In the more democratic Apple store, the exchange is decentralized: Scan your purchase on your phone, then waltz out of the store unassailed. It\u2019s like everything is yours already.While we may, in pursuit of a bargain, suffer the cacophony of Century 21 or allow Ikea to swallow us whole and squeeze us through its labyrinthine intestine, the relationship between the big commercial store and the luxury object is fraught. That ultra-precious handbag tends to hemorrhage aura when set in context of innumerable clones. When luxury goods are offered in a simulated domestic setting, the brutal impersonality of mass production and merchandising is disguised behind the fantasy of exclusivity. Intimacy equals desirability.There was a time when bigness was in. Big meant choice. Big meant entertainment. Big meant the whole world in a box. Malls touted square footage as the metric of shopping exhilaration. Macy\u2019s Herald Square billed itself as the \u201cworld\u2019s largest store.\u201d In the early decades of the last century, shoppers entered the fabled Wanamaker\u2019s department store in Philadelphia through a towering Corinthian portico to browse in a great Roman-Doric court, a fantastical Egyptian hall, and Byzantine, Empire and Art Nouveau period rooms. Merchandise from across the globe was displayed with exhibitions of Old Master paintings and exotic objets d\u2019art. The grand department store was a portal to the world, the commercial twin of the great encyclopedic civic museums, where uplifting and educating the masses was serious business.At the same time, Sears, Roebuck & Co. and Montgomery Ward were delivering bigness to the rural masses through the original home shopping network: consolidated mail-order catalogs, some over 700 pages, that offered everything from button-hooks and brassieres to motor buggies, delivered directly to their customer\u2019s doorstep via the U.S.P.S. An early Sears catalog cover, boasting \u201cOur trade reaches around the world,\u201d featured a fair-skinned maiden, addressed envelope in hand, floating over a bucolic American farmstead astride a cornucopia spilling furniture, guns, pianos and clothing. The mail-order catalog provided nationwide domestic access to a previously unimaginable selection of products. Inventory was king.By the \u201960s, Sears alone reportedly accounted for almost 1 percent of the U.S. gross national product, employed 350,000 people and provided credit cards to over half the population. (The hippie-domestic Whole Earth Catalog was launched as that era\u2019s proto-Brooklyn, D.I.Y. alternative \u2014 the original Etsy.) Fast-forward to the now-familiar narrative of the exurban big-box revolution. Walmart became the world\u2019s largest retailer and QVC and Home Shopping Network began to deliver 24/7 in-home access to cubic zirconium, spot remover and miracle knife sets to anyone with a television and telephone.And then something came along that was bigger than all that came before it, with the real potential to access the whole earth, and everything changed. The internet made shopping the world not only a reality but an essential feature of everyday life for millions of people. Enter global shopping with a hyperlocal interface: as local as your own couch. Amazon has out-bigged the biggest big box \u2014 adding 17 million square feet of warehouse space just last year \u2014 and in achieving such massive scale, fomented the expectation that anything you could possibly need is always in stock, immediately available and just a keystroke away.Now even the keystroke has been disrupted. With the recent innovation of Amazon Dash buttons \u2014 branded clickers that automatically place an order for a specific product \u2014 the home is the interface and the pantry has been outsourced. Out of Tide? Just hit the button on the Dash device, and that familiar orange box will appear on your doorstep in a matter of minutes by way of a friendly union-free drone. As it is estimated that the average American woman uses a mere fraction of her wardrobe and wears a new purchase only a handful of times, that logic of linked distribution will almost certainly spread to your closet. It may be only a matter of time before we have a Chanel Dash button, a Calvin Dash button. Winter clothes storage in the summer? Forget it. Out of style? Just send it back. Same with sizing. Your wardrobe will follow your climate, your body and your mood. All that warehouse space is an extension of your own personal space.As our shelves and closets are sensored for automatic fulfillment, and our pantries communicate directly with the public larders to keep them perpetually brimming with the bounty of American plenty, there will be ever less reason to leave the comfortable confines of our homes. The comprehensive sites such as Amazon and Zappos, and the curated ones like Net-a-Porter and Yoox, provide our great database of commodities. As product research and price comparison are relocated from physical spaces to virtual ones \u2014 it\u2019s called a browser for a reason \u2014 the function of stores shifts from a site of discovery and transaction to something else ... what, exactly, is at the moment hotly contested.Bigness, at least in terms of luxury, seems to be a dwindling proposition. Discovery and selection in the physical world can never match the reach of the internet with its huge-scale aggregators, branded e-commerce shops, curatorial shopping sites, and the long trail of small boutiques and Etsy home-crafters offering anything and everything. What the shop can offer, however, are things difficult to achieve online: an intimate relationship with things, a haptic appreciation of materiality, a personal interaction with a sympathetic helper, an experience that contextualizes objects, a place to socialize with like-minded connoisseurs and, most importantly, a respite from the avalanche of too much stuff. Consider that the much-vaunted Apple store, which has the highest profit per-square-foot of any store in the United States, essentially offers variants of four products: telephone, watch, music player and laptop. In an ironic reversal, stores now may have to offer less to stay relevant.If we\u2019ve become used to, and adept at, shopping from bed, and as our homes are increasingly conjoined to distant warehouses that monitor their status, shops themselves may become extensions of the social function of our domestic space. As simple fulfillment of household commodities becomes automated, browsing, research and cost comparison become the prelude to shopping, not its raison d\u2019\u00eatre. A visit to the store may revert back to John Wanamaker\u2019s original dream: shopping as a form of education and cultural edification. Maybe we learn best in the places that we feel most comfortable in: places that feel like our own living room, only nicer.Oh, and whatever happened to Wanamaker\u2019s? In Manhattan, the gargantuan old department store now houses a corporate headquarters ... for Facebook.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Think Tank Scholar or Corporate Consultant? It Depends on the Day", "Date": "2016-08-08", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Over the many months that officials in Washington debated sweeping new regulations for internet providers, Jeffrey A. Eisenach, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, was hard to miss.And he has plenty of company.An examination of 75 think tanks found an array of researchers who had simultaneously worked as registered lobbyists, members of corporate boards or outside consultants in litigation and regulatory disputes, with only intermittent disclosure of their dual roles.With their expertise and authority, think tank scholars offer themselves as independent arbiters, playing a vital role in Washington\u2019s political economy. Their imprimatur helps shape government decisions that can be lucrative to corporations.But the examination identified dozens of examples of scholars conducting research at think tanks while corporations were paying them to help shape government policy. Many think tanks also readily confer \u201cnonresident scholar\u201d status on lobbyists, former government officials and others who earn their primary living working for private clients, with few restrictions on such outside work.Largely free from disclosure requirements, the researchers\u2019 work is often woven into elaborate corporate lobbying campaigns.And it is a decidedly bipartisan practice.The overlapping roles are often not made clear, and even members of Congress say they are frequently unaware of the financial ties between industries and the witnesses with think tank titles appearing before them at hearings.\u201cThey can make a very deceptive and false claim to credibility that is totally lacking,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who said he had become increasingly disturbed by the role of think tank experts on Capitol Hill. \u201cI think about it every time there is a witness now from a \u2018think tank,\u2019 putting that term in very boldface quotes.\u201dScholars sometimes include general references to their private-sector work in their official biographies. Mr. Eisenach, for example, notes that he is an executive at NERA Economic Consulting in addition to his position at the American Enterprise Institute. And when a private company pays him or his consulting firm to publish a study, he discloses the name of the corporate sponsor on the study.But there is no way for the public or policy makers to know Mr. Eisenach\u2019s full roster of NERA clients. And there is no comprehensive disclosure of these clients when he writes his think tank reports or academic papers, testifies before Congress, or meets with F.C.C. members or staff.Mr. Eisenach declined repeated requests to comment in detail. But a spokeswoman for the American Enterprise Institute, Judy Mayka Stecker, said she saw no conflict in his roles.\u201cWe believe in the open competition of ideas and encourage our scholars to engage with experts from all sectors and viewpoints,\u201d she said.A footnote on the first page of the letter indicated that none of the scholars who signed had been compensated by stakeholder companies. But of the dozen studies they submitted as evidence, more than half had been funded by telecommunications giants or based on other work for the companies, industry ties that were disclosed only in footnotes in the original studies.No federal rules required broader disclosure. Yet on many highly technical policy issues like telecommunications regulation, scholarship is dominated by industry-funded research, according to a review of hundreds of studies, regulatory filings and other documents.\u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re in legal and you want to have a paper that says what you want it to say,\u201d said Dennis Weller, a former Verizon economist who occasionally consults for telecommunications companies and international organizations. \u201cYou could have a bunch of economists in house and ask them if they agree with you. How much easier would it be to go to an outside economist and say, \u2018How about if I pay you $100,000 to write this?\u2019\u201dFew policy battles have had higher stakes in recent years than the debate over net neutrality \u2014 a catchall term for proposals to restrict internet service providers from blocking websites or regulating speed.To bolster their claims that the regulations would hurt consumers, companies have financed research that contends the rules would reduce investment in new services and raise prices. That work is used to shape the public debate and to build an industry-funded narrative in the regulatory record, one that the F.C.C. is required by law to evaluate.Industry-sponsored research has also figured prominently in court battles over F.C.C. efforts to regulate the internet. When Verizon successfully opposed an earlier F.C.C. rule on net neutrality, more than half of the 23 studies or expert declarations cited in court filings had been sponsored directly by telecommunications companies or trade associations, according to an analysis by The Times. Other studies had been published under the banner of think tanks but written by scholars who consulted extensively for companies.The attacks began to grow particularly heated nearly two years ago, when Mr. Obama called on Mr. Wheeler and his fellow F.C.C. commissioners to regulate the internet like traditional phone lines.The study mentioned their employment at Economists Incorporated, a consulting firm in Washington. But a reader would have had to do more research to learn that Economists Incorporated\u2019s clients included AT&T and Verizon, companies leading the industry\u2019s charge against the commission proposal. That was disclosed on a \u201cselect client list\u201d on the Economists Incorporated website.\u201cPeople who are running advertisements are not going to say, \u2018In a study we paid for,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Litan, now an adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cIn the public discourse, the disclaimers often do get dropped.\u201d\u201cNone of us works for free,\u201d Mr. Singer wrote. \u201cSo let\u2019s focus on the merits & be nice to each other!\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Singer said he \u2014 like most scholars \u2014 disclosed when a client commissioned a particular study published through his consulting firm. Most specialists in the telecommunications field, he suggested, are well aware of his business connections and views on regulatory issues.\u201cEverybody is on different teams,\u201d Mr. Singer said. \u201cSo long as you tell the audience what team you are on, you can then offer the opinions. Disclosure is the antidote to all of this.\u201dFew scholars have been as active in the net neutrality debate as Mr. Eisenach.\u201cJeff is good at linking big theoretical ideas to policy, and he\u2019s been good at making money doing that,\u201d said Mr. Weller, the former Verizon economist. \u201cHe\u2019s been good at moving from think tank to think tank and company to company, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever lost money doing it.\u201dAt a given moment, it can be difficult to determine which hat Mr. Eisenach is wearing.In September 2014, at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on net neutrality, the formal meeting agenda listed Mr. Eisenach as a visiting scholar at the institute.Scholar, consultant, expert witness \u2014 Jeffrey A. Eisenach has worn all these hats while playing a leading role in the debate over telecommunications policy in the United States. Here is a look at the potential conflicts that this situation creates for Mr. Eiensach, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.He then detailed his vehement opposition to further federal regulation of the internet.Mr. Eisenach was similarly ambiguous when he interacted with members of the F.C.C., according to dozens of emails obtained by The Times, all but one of which was sent from Mr. Eisenach\u2019s email address at the American Enterprise Institute.On behalf of the think tank, he sought meetings with F.C.C. commissioners and lawyers to discuss the rules, and briefed the commission\u2019s Republican members on what its general counsel was telling him about Mr. Wheeler\u2019s thinking. Mr. Eisenach offered speaking slots at American Enterprise Institute events to the two Republican members on the commission, urging one to use a January 2015 forum to speak out against the proposed regulations.Ms. Stecker, the institute spokeswoman, said it should be no surprise that the opinions of experts like Mr. Eisenach were in demand. The think tank requires scholars to submit an annual report on any \u201coutside activities,\u201d she added, and A.E.I. has \u201cnot as an institution sought to influence or constrain\u201d this work.While private consulting arrangements can leave scholars\u2019 ties to corporate interests murky, the conflict is more apparent when think tank researchers do double duty as registered lobbyists.Mr. Verdery, a former senior official at the Department of Homeland Security whose office helped run the inspection program at foreign airports, briefly mentioned that in addition to his status as a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, he was the founder of the Monument Policy Group.Officials at the Toronto airport, with Mr. Verdery\u2019s help, have been trying to persuade the American authorities to increase staff and equipment to reduce bottlenecks sometimes created by the preclearance program.Asked whether it was appropriate for a lobbyist to host his clients at a think tank event, Mr. Verdery said, \u201cIt is fairly typical.\u201dMr. Verdery is not paid by the think tank, he noted. He does benefit from the C.S.I.S. title, however, when laying out a client\u2019s case.As of late last year, at least 70 unpaid senior advisers and associates listed on the think tank\u2019s website had simultaneously worked as consultants. Seven others listed as C.S.I.S. senior advisers or associates during the past five years had worked as registered corporate lobbyists while holding the positions.Officials at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, when asked about Mr. Verdery, said his December presentation should not have occurred.\u201cThis event did not meet our standards of transparency and integrity,\u201d the think tank said in a statement in response to questions. \u201cThis constituted a lapse in oversight from C.S.I.S.\u201dMr. Verdery is no longer listed among the think tank\u2019s senior associates.Bruce Bartlett, a scholar who has worked at the Cato Institute and the Heritage Foundation, said it was becoming the norm in Washington for lobbyists and consultants like Mr. Verdery to vie for nonresident scholar posts to help them burnish sales pitches to corporate clients.\u201cClients prefer it that way,\u201d Mr. Bartlett said. \u201cThey get a chance to have their work done by scholars.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think they see any downside,\u201d Mr. Miller said of his corporate clients and the think tank.While Mr. Miller is not well known, he has high-profile company.Mr. Dorgan did not immediately register as a lobbyist, but his firm has oil and gas industry clients.Asked if his dual role represented a conflict of interest, Mr. Dorgan said that the premise of the Bipartisan Policy Center was \u201cto bring interested parties together to find solutions to difficult problems,\u201d and that he was proud to work there.Mr. Zakheim, of the American Enterprise Institute, is also a lobbyist at Covington & Burling L.L.P., where, on behalf of BAE Systems, he is urging Congress and the Defense Department to increase spending on ground combat vehicles that the company manufactures. Other clients include Northrop Grumman, which is building a new long-range Air Force bomber.Some scholars add another twist: They serve on corporate boards directly related to their areas of expertise at think tanks.Dr. McClellan, a former commissioner at the Food and Drug Administration who until January was a senior fellow at Brookings, has been a go-to expert for the federal government as it debates how to cope with surging costs of prescription drugs.At public events, Dr. McClellan emphasized the extraordinary progress by the pharmaceutical industry in coming up with treatments for diseases like diabetes, H.I.V. and hepatitis C.Dr. McClellan, in a statement, disputed any suggestion that he might have had a conflict.\u201cMy entire career in academics, government and public policy has focused on evidence-based ways to improve health and restrain costs for consumers, and my extensive track record speaks for itself,\u201d he said.She said that her change of heart on nuclear power had predated her engagement with Nuclear Matters, and was motivated by her desire to combat climate change, not by payment from the industry.\u201cObviously, the single most important thing any individual has is their reputation,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cI have worked really hard to be forthcoming about what I stand for and believe in. I am who I am.\u201dAdam S. Posen, the president of the Peterson Institute, considered the world\u2019s pre-eminent think tank on global economics, has a commanding view of the construction of the new headquarters for the American Enterprise Institute, as well as the main office of Brookings. In his office, he recently had a series of uncomfortable conversations with three scholars he had decided to let go.After much internal debate, Mr. Posen decided to formally prohibit Peterson\u2019s scholars from holding outside jobs that directly related to the field they wrote about on behalf of the think tank.The three who had such outside engagements were terminated.Mr. Posen noted that the change did not imply the researchers had done anything wrong. But tighter rules are needed, he said, to respond to a growing sense he shares with the Peterson board that the think tank industry must reassert its commitment to impartiality.\u201cI live in a glass house,\u201d said Mr. Posen, a Harvard-trained economist who previously served on the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England, gesturing toward the floor-to-ceiling glass that provides him stunning views.\u201cOur reputation is built on our credibility,\u201d Mr. Posen said. \u201cWithout being perceived as credible and objective, our studies just get thrown on the scrap heap.\u201dThe Urban Institute, a Washington-based think tank that focuses on issues confronting cities, has decided to require that its scholars with any outside jobs detail the relationship in their writings.And at Brookings, executives imposed new rules in December requiring that unpaid nonresident scholars use their title from any paying job, not from Brookings, if they testify before Congress. They are also prohibited from using their affiliation with Brookings in any research report they publish under contract with an outside party.\u201cI\u2019ve moved on to other issues,\u201d Mr. Eisenach said.\u201cIt has gotten to the point where everyone in Washington has their own expert,\u201d Mr. Medvetz said. \u201cIt is yet another reflection of the tremendous influence of economic power in American politics \u2014 as with money, you can create your own vehicles of political influence.\u201dStill, not everyone is worried about the multiple roles played by think tank scholars.\u201cEveryone\u2019s got their point of view,\u201d Mr. Walden said in an interview last year. \u201cAnd some of them get paid to have that point of view.\u201dBrooke Williams is a reporter at the New England Center for Investigative Reporting, which collaborated with The New York Times on this series.

On Saturday, after backing was gathered all the way to the Marines\u2019 top officer, the terminally ill boy received the rare title of honorary Marine in a quickly assembled ceremony at the Marine Corps Base Camp in Pendleton, Calif.A day later, at age 7, he was gone.

In point of fact, no \u2014 our corporate taxes are among the very highest in the industrialized world, make us uncompetitive and incentivize our companies to bolt; our regulation is stifling expansion and job-creation; and free trade policies have played their role, along with offshoring and automation, in hollowing-out our middle classes.And the rest of \u201cthe world\u201d is hardly healthy \u2014 their tax and regulatory frameworks have a great deal to do with their sorry state.But I can understand the concern: whenever Trump talks sense rather than erupting over some sleight, his numbers go up.This comment received over 115 reader responses.Advertisement"}

Mr. Parker was acquitted, based partly on testimony that he and the victim had previously had consensual sex. Mr. Celestin was convicted of sexual assault and sentenced to prison, but the conviction was eventually overturned. The victim, who sued Penn State because she said the university did not protect her from the harassment she endured after filing charges, received a settlement of $17,500.Both Mr. Parker and Mr. Celestin now have families and successful careers.

He was 66.Juan Gabriel released the first of several dozen albums in 1971 and continued to release records at a relentless pace, including two this year. He was nominated for six Grammy Awards and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1996, he was inducted into the Billboard Latin Music Hall of Fame.He was adept at keeping up with shifting genres, combining a contemporary pop sensibility with traditional Mexican music, often appearing with a full mariachi band in tow. A populist at heart, he wrote and sang songs that focused on the everyday dramas of life and love.He also had collaborative spirit, working with well-known Latin American artists like Ana Gabriel and Marc Anthony, many of whom covered his songs.Juan Gabriel was born Alberto Aguilera Valadez on Jan. 7, 1950, in the state of Michoacan, on the Pacific coast west of Mexico City. One of 10 siblings, he was initially raised by his mother and began writing his own songs at age 13.His father, Gabriel Aguilera, was committed to a mental hospital, and his mother took the family to Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, across the Texas border from El Paso. Unable to support Gabriel, she placed him in a children\u2019s home when he was 5. It was there that he met Juan Contreras, a deaf musician who had played in a band. Juan Gabriel chose the stage name in honor of both his father and Mr. Contreras, his first teacher.In an interview with the Mexican newspaper La Jornada in 2012, to mark the 40th anniversary of his musical career, Juan Gabriel said both the pain and the joys of his childhood coursed through his music.\u201cEveryone who gave me food, who took away my hunger, inspired me to compose,\u201d he said. \u201cThey told me their stories, and I had no other way to console them than with a piece of music, and that is how I learned. I did not resolve their problems with my songs, but I created a moment of release. They would cry, and they had more affection for me, and that is how I grew up.\u201dHe ran away from the children\u2019s home at 14. \u201cOne day I took out the garbage and never went back,\u201d he said.He played in the nightclubs of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, but he had set his hopes on a bigger prize and set out for Mexico City. Accused of stealing a guitar, he spent a year and a half in the city\u2019s Lecumberri prison.His luck changed when the ranchera singer Enriqueta Jim\u00e9nez heard him and persuaded her producers to hire him.Early hits like \u201cNo Tengo Dinero\u201d (1971) focused on his humble beginnings, making him something of a folk hero.Juan Gabriel stopped recording and performing for several years in the 1980s while battling his record label, BMG, for control of his music. He eventually came to an agreement with the company and gained control of many of his songs.There was no immediate word on his survivors.In a tell-all book, \u201cJuan Gabriel and I,\u201d a former secretary of Juan Gabriel\u2019s, Joaqu\u00edn Mu\u00f1oz, said that he and Juan Gabriel had had a sexual relationship, The A.P. reported, an assertion that Juan Gabriel did not confirm or deny. Years later it became known that he had fathered four children with a friend, Laura Salas.\u201cHis were not simple concerts, they were religious, mystical and communal experiences,\u201d Mr. Vel\u00e1zquez wrote. \u201cHis lyrics made up not songs, but rather hymns.\u201dElisabeth Malkin and Paulina Villegas contributed reporting from Mexico City.Advertisement"}

Advertisers, including many political campaigns, pay Facebook to show their ads to specific demographic groups. The labels Facebook assigns to its users help campaigns more precisely target a particular audience.For instance, Donald J.

A copy of the report was obtained by The New York Times.The critique is the latest example of the Obama administration\u2019s aggressive push for police reforms in cities where young African-American men have died at the hands of law enforcement.The findings, to be released Wednesday, are the first formal step toward the Justice Department\u2019s reaching a settlement with Baltimore \u2014 known as a \u201cconsent decree\u201d \u2014 in which police practices would be overhauled under the oversight of a federal judge. The department started the inquiry at the invitation of Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake.To show how officers disproportionately stopped black pedestrians, the report cited the example of a black man in his mid-50s who was stopped 30 times in less than four years. None of the stops led to a citation or criminal charge. Black residents, the report said, accounted for 95 percent of the 410 individuals stopped at least 10 times in the five and a half years of data reviewed.The most pronounced racial disparities were in arrests for the most discretionary offenses: For example, 91 percent of those arrested solely for \u201cfailure to obey\u201d or \u201ctrespassing\u201d were African-American, even though the city is 63 percent black, the report found.In one telling anecdote from the report, a shift commander provided officers with boilerplate language on how to write up trespassing arrest reports of people found near housing projects. The template contained an automatic description of the arrestee: \u201cA BLACK MALE.\u201d\u201cThe supervisor\u2019s template thus presumes that individuals arrested for trespassing will be African-American,\u201d the report stated, describing the sort of detentions the language was intended to facilitate as \u201cfacially unconstitutional.\u201dThe report indicated that the frequency of arrests without probable cause was reflected in the fact that booking supervisors and prosecutors had declined to file charges, after arrests by their own officers, more than 11,000 times since 2010.Two weeks ago, Maryland prosecutors dropped charges against the last of six officers charged in the April 2015 death of Mr. Gray, who sustained a fatal spinal cord injury while in custody. With that, Baltimore joined a growing list of cities where police-involved deaths sparked outrage, and even riots, yet no one was held accountable in court.While no consent decree has been reached, the report states that the city and the Justice Department have agreed in principle to identify \u201ccategories of reforms the parties agree must be taken to remedy the violations of the Constitution and federal law described in this report.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think at this point, it\u2019s about justice for Freddie Gray anymore,\u201d said Ray Kelly, a director of the No Boundaries Coalition, a West Baltimore group that provided its own report on police abuses to the Justice Department. \u201cNow it\u2019s about justice for our community, for our people.\u201dBaltimore is among nearly two dozen cities that the Obama administration has investigated after they were accused of widespread unconstitutional policing. Using its broad latitude to enforce civil rights laws, the Justice Department has demanded wholesale change in how cities conduct policing. In several cities, including Seattle; Cleveland; and Ferguson, Mo., those investigations began in the aftermath of a high-profile death that sparked protests and in some cases riots.Police chiefs, prosecutors and experts say the investigations have forced cities to address longstanding, entrenched issues far beyond the targeted cities.\u201cChiefs are constantly looking at these reports, not just to learn lessons and best practices from each other, but also what pitfalls we can avoid,\u201d said Scott Thomson, the police chief in Camden, N.J., who is also the president of the Police Executive Research Forum.But court-ordered reform can take years, which does little to ease the frustration of activists who say that police officers too often go unpunished for deadly encounters with unarmed people.A Justice Department investigation into the practices of the Baltimore police department found \"reasonable cause to believe that the BPD engages in a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the Constitution or federal law.\"Dayvon Love, 29, a founder of the Baltimore advocacy group Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle, said that changes would come only when civilians have a say in whether officers should face punishment. Mr. Love described frustrating meetings with Justice Department officials \u2014 including Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch.\u201cI was very skeptical and not really that enthused about meeting with them,\u201d Mr. Love said. At one point, he said, he asked Ms. Lynch what she could do to change state law and give civilians more power over the police. \u201cShe said what I figured she\u2019d say, which is that from her position as attorney general, she can\u2019t really do anything about it.\u201dThe Supreme Court has given police officers wide latitude in how they can use deadly force, which makes prosecuting them difficult, even in the killing of unarmed people. For the Justice Department to charge an officer with a federal crime, the bar is even higher. Prosecutors must show that the officer willfully violated someone\u2019s civil rights.In Baltimore, black residents have been complaining for years of systematic abuse by the department. When the city\u2019s top prosecutor, Marilyn Mosby, failed to get any convictions in Mr. Gray\u2019s death, many in the city\u2019s poorest African-American neighborhoods were not surprised.After the 1991 beating of Rodney King in Los Angeles, Congress gave the Justice Department the power to investigate police departments for patterns of civil rights violations. The Obama administration has used that authority more aggressively than any other. Prosecutors are enforcing consent decrees on police departments in 14 cities.\u201cWe tend to confront systemic problems only when forced to by seemingly extraordinary events,\u201d Vanita Gupta, the Justice Department\u2019s top civil rights prosecutor, said last year.In Seattle, the investigation followed an officer\u2019s shooting of a Native American woodcarver in 2010. The shooting was ruled unjustified, but prosecutors said they could not meet the legal standard to file charges. The federal authorities, however, found a pattern of excessive force and ordered the Police Department to provide better training and oversight. In recent years, the Justice Department has held Seattle up as an example of how cities can best respond to scathing investigations.The report is sure to fuel a broader debate on aggressive policing practices, as it blames much of Baltimore\u2019s woes on so-called \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policies adopted in the late 1990s. They were aimed at anyone on the streets whom officers viewed as suspect, making heavy use of stop-and-frisk and other confrontation techniques.But the approach, the report found, \u201cled to repeated violations of the constitutional and statutory rights, further eroding the community\u2019s trust in the police.\u201dWhile Baltimore officials have sought to curb the most extreme zero-tolerance policies, the legacy of the strategy continues to vex the department.One example the report cited was a police sergeant who recently posted on Facebook that the \u201csolution to the murder rate is easy: flex cuffs and a line at\u201d the central booking office, made up of people arrested on charges of loitering.An article on Wednesday about a Justice Department report on the Baltimore Police Department misstated, in some editions, part of the name of the organization led by Scott Thompson, who commented on the report. It is the Police Executive Research Forum (not Foundation). The article also misstated the surname of the president of the research forum in some editions. He is Scott Thomson, not Thompson.Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Matt Apuzzo reported from Washington, and Richard A. Oppel Jr. from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Israel\u2019s Modern-Orthodox Jews Came Out of the Closet", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "Supported byJERUSALEM \u2014 On July 21, a young Israeli woman posted an account on Facebook about falling in love with another woman. The young woman comes from a modern-Orthodox Jewish family. She had been hoping to have a traditional Orthodox family life \u2014 a husband and several children living in a community adhering to Jewish law. Yet after a decade of searching for love, she ended up finding it where she least expected. Her true love came tangled up with the heartbreaking realization that everything she was hoping for \u2014 the husband, the children, the community \u2014 was not going to happen the way she envisioned it.That young woman is my sister.It\u2019s no surprise that these remarks were met with dismay by Israel\u2019s secular, liberal communities. Somewhat more surprising was the criticism emanating from modern-Orthodox rabbis, political leaders and citizens. Naftali Bennett, the education minister and head of the Zionist-Orthodox Jewish Home party, was quick to reject Rabbi Levenstein\u2019s comments, which were \u201cnot the way of religious Zionism,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t insult an entire sector of the public and hide behind Jewish law.\u201dTo be sure, not all modern-Orthodox Israelis agreed about the rabbi\u2019s offensive remarks. The sudden wall-to-wall condemnation of his statements prompted many of his colleagues and some of his constituency to rush to his defense. More than 300 rabbis signed a letter backing \u201cevery rabbi who expresses his Halachic and moral view.\u201d (Halachic refers to Jewish religious law.) Yet even this letter was somewhat reluctant to endorse Rabbi Levenstein\u2019s harsh language.But Rabbi Levenstein\u2019s outburst and the rabbis\u2019 petition were evidence to the contrary: They showed that the rabbinical establishment is in distress. The military is educating its soldiers to be tolerant of the L.G.B.T. community. The legal system is ruling in favor of equal rights for L.G.B.T. couples. And when a rabbi decides to cry foul, and remind his listeners that Jewish law has a clear-cut view against homosexuality, he is portrayed as a bigot and gets harsh condemnations from almost every quarter.What the \u201cperverts\u201d incident proved is that not even the people who supposedly share the rabbis\u2019 view that according to Jewish law homosexuality is an abomination are willing to tolerate hateful language. Not even those who rightly insist that rabbis ought not always be subjected to the rules of political correctness accept attempts to humiliate fellow Israelis. And why would they tolerate it? These gay people are not outcasts. They are our neighbors, friends, colleagues and families. My family.Rabbi Levenstein miscalculated: He thought he was drawing a line against sexual permissiveness. He ended up forcing the modern-Orthodox community to draw a line against rabbinical small-mindedness.Shmuel Rosner is the political editor at The Jewish Journal, a senior fellow at the Jewish People Policy Institute and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sydney Morning Herald Faces Uncertain Print Future in Australia", "Date": "2016-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey pushed for women to get the vote in Australia\u2019s national elections. They brought down a central bank board member. And they helped convict a state official.The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and their sister publications at Fairfax Media have been among the most powerful voices in Australia for more than 150 years, shaping public opinion on politics, exposing shady business practices and targeting vast criminal operations. Once mocked as a \u201cGranny\u201d for its cautious, worldly perspective, The Herald long ago embraced the reputation and the nickname.But Fairfax\u2019s newspapers now face a diminished future, with company executives even discussing whether to stop printing The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age on weekdays. If they do, it would signal a new low in the decline of the global newspaper business, the radical retreat of centuries-old, mainstream metropolitan newspapers with national influence.The prospect has dismayed many Australians who wonder what it means for civic life and what it says about the country\u2019s place in the world. Australians consider themselves a highly informed and highly educated society, despite their geographic isolation. And The Herald and Age, with a history of sending correspondents to far-flung locales like the battlefields of Europe and Southeast Asia, have been central to the discourse.The weakening of independent voices like The Herald also leaves the Australian market increasingly dominated by the partisan agenda of News Corporation, which owns the country\u2019s top three newspapers by weekday circulation. The struggles at Fairfax represent an especially satisfying victory for News Corporation, run by the homegrown billionaire Rupert Murdoch, who turned his family\u2019s original asset \u2014 a single provincial Australian newspaper \u2014 into a global media empire. Although News Corporation has faced its own financial strains, its other successful businesses, like a real estate website, have provided better support for its journalistic operations.Trouble at Fairfax Media \u201cconstitutes a crisis in civic journalism in our country, because the resources will no longer be there,\u201d said Eric Beecher, a former top editor at The Herald and at News Corporation who is now the publisher of Crikey, a news website. \u201cThe Age and The Sydney Morning Herald have always done the heavy lifting of civic journalism and investigative journalism.\u201dEven by the newspaper industry\u2019s standards, readers of Australia\u2019s print newspapers have been declining at an unusually rapid rate.The chief executive for Fairfax Media, Greg Hywood, said the company had not made a decision whether to halt weekday printing, although it was under review. If printing is halted, he said, the company\u2019s journalistic approach would not be affected.\u201cOur readers have never been hungrier for good-quality news reporting,\u201d Mr. Hywood said.When The Herald opened its state-of-the-art, $260 million presses in 1995, the newspaper\u2019s Saturday edition was a hefty 400 pages. The company predicted it would easily grow to 600 pages.After all, The Herald and the rest of the Fairfax Media papers had practically cornered the market in Sydney and Melbourne for classified advertising for cars, jobs and real estate. Those so-called rivers of gold helped support a robust reporting operation.\u201cWe wondered how on earth we would print a paper that size,\u201d said Mr. Hywood, who was once the Washington correspondent for another Fairfax newspaper, The Australian Financial Review.It was also the same year that Fairfax started its first digital news site, in retrospect, roughly the peak for the print business.The Saturday edition has now shrunk to around 200 pages. Fairfax has cut more than 500 jobs at city newspapers over the last five years, including 100 in April, according to Australia\u2019s union for journalists. And last year The Herald\u2019s cherished printing presses were sold for $34 million.The headwinds now buffeting The Herald and Age are global, as the internet erodes the protections once afforded by geography. There\u2019s the ubiquitous competition from Facebook and Google. Digital native publications like BuzzFeed and The Huffington Post each have small Australian newsrooms without the sizable costs of legacy papers like The Herald.The \u201crivers of gold\u201d have evaporated. Advertising and subscriptions have particularly wilted on weekdays; weekends now represent two-thirds of the revenues at Fairfax\u2019s major newspapers.In the sign of the depths of the print problems, the company this month wrote off much of its investment in the newspapers. Fairfax\u2019s main saving grace has been its fast-growing real estate website, Domain, which has helped offset the losses.Such industry challenges forced papers in some large American cities to rethink their print presence years ago. The Times-Picayune of New Orleans cut printing to three days a week, while The Seattle Post-Intelligencer is online only. Facing cutthroat competition in the crowded British market, The Independent in London, which started in the 1980s to shake up the media establishment, went digital this year.Some of The Herald\u2019s wounds were self-inflicted.As the dot-com boom took off and media companies moved online, Fairfax separated its digital operations, in the hope of eventually taking the group public. At The Herald, there were two newsrooms, one for the newspaper and one for the web.The division created a rift. A younger online staff chased clicks, loading the site up with gossip-fueled content, heavy on sex, celebrity and crime. It rankled more seasoned veterans in the print newsroom, who lamented the shift away from weightier topics like the domestic economy and global politics.\u201cIt was viewed that online there was a lot more Paris Hilton than Paris, France, and that to win online you needed to be a tabloid newspaper,\u201d said Mark Scott, a former Fairfax executive who most recently served as chief executive of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. \u201cThe Herald\u2019s strength had always been its great quality, broadsheet traditions.\u201dThe newsrooms were eventually merged and the website now takes a somewhat more balanced approach. But stories about Kylie Jenner\u2019s Vogue cover and the abs of Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, are still intermingled online with more hard-hitting newspaper articles about the terror links in a child care fraud and the serious flaws in the country\u2019s census.Like many media operations, Fairfax is trying to strike a difficult balance. The meatier topics may play well to the newspaper audience, generally an older crowd. But Mr. Hywood, the Fairfax chief, said that online readers, who skew younger, want a broader mix.In terms of readers, the digital strategy appears to be clicking. The Herald is the nation\u2019s leading website, by the number of paying subscribers.\u201cThat can be criticized by people who prefer highbrow content,\u201d said Megan Brownlow, an executive director in the Sydney offices of PricewaterhouseCoopers, the consulting firm. \u201cBut when you\u2019re in a numbers game like internet advertising, highbrow content is hard to monetize.\u201dEven so, it strikes a nerve within the newsroom, which worries about losing its voice within Australian society.The ranks of The Herald, like so many newspapers around the world, have been decimated by cuts over the years. Reporters have gone on strike, deriding the rounds of job losses.Some losses have cut to the core. Four years ago, 70 journalists were laid off within one week. Gone were the urban affairs editor, a senior political correspondent, a specialist feature writer, a senior business reporter, the health editor, arts editor and senior crime reporter.Mr. Hywood denies that reporters are now thin on the ground. Fairfax plans to use the profits from non-news properties, like Domain and a television streaming service, Stan, to promote and support the company\u2019s journalism.But the financial picture at the newspapers continues to deteriorate, forcing Fairfax to contemplate the once-unthinkable. If The Herald drastically cuts its publication schedule, the fear inside and outside the newsroom is that the journalistic endeavors will suffer.Kate McClymont, 58, has been breaking news at The Sydney Morning Herald for decades. One of the newspaper\u2019s marquee journalists, Ms. McClymont appears in the paper\u2019s ads.\u201cWe have been holding the powerful in this city to account for a long time,\u201d Ms. McClymont said.Most recently, she pursued a state government minister, Eddie Obeid, uncovering how his private businesses were improperly benefiting from his public role. Mr. Obeid was found guilty in June of misusing his public office. He will soon face a second court case over mining leases he obtained from the state government.\u201cWe have shone a light where crooks would prefer places remained dark,\u201d Ms. McClymont said. \u201cI hate the idea of people getting away with anything.\u201d\u201cIt is bad for democracy,\u201d she added, \u201cif this voice is diminished in any way.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump a Working-Class Hero? A Blue-Collar Town Debates His Credentials", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "The talk gets heated in Youngstown, Ohio, when residents discuss whether a New York billionaire\u2019s ideas can revitalize a struggling Rust Belt town.Supported byYOUNGSTOWN, Ohio \u2014 \u201cIs this idiot for Trump?\u201d Mark Wasko asked, his voice booming across the parking lot of an out-of-business supermarket.It was a late weekday morning in a troubled, shrinking Rust Belt city that is fed up with being known as a troubled, shrinking Rust Belt city. The man Mr. Wasko was calling an idiot \u2014 perhaps seriously, or playfully, or both \u2014 was his friend Vincent Archangelo Strines.Mr. Wasko, 48, had seen Mr. Strines, 55, a beefy blond man with a pack of cigarillos in his breast pocket, sitting behind a folding table and selling raffle tickets to support his nonprofit addiction recovery organization. So Mr. Wasko had parked his big soda truck in the lot and hopped out. He was appalled to learn that his friend, normally a Democratic voter, was now supporting Donald J. Trump.He looked Mr. Strines in the eye. \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot,\u201d he declared.Youngstown is the kind of blue-collar Midwestern stronghold where Mr. Trump\u2019s struggling campaign must make a strong showing, particularly among white voters, if he is to have any chance of winning the presidential election. Broaching the topic of Mr. Trump on a street corner or bar stool here \u2014 and thus delving into matters of race, economics, immigration and the still-painful matter of the city\u2019s disintegration \u2014 can be a volatile business.\u201cIf you want to punch me in the face, do it,\u201d Mr. Strines dared Mr. Wasko casually, after about 15 minutes of debate that played out under a billboard for a nearby adult novelty store called Sassy Sensations and touched on all of those issues.Cars whooshed up and down Mahoning Avenue, past businesses shuttered or struggling, and past tired residential side streets now considered \u201cfood deserts\u201d since the grocery store, a Sparkle Market, closed down about four years ago. Youngstown, a city of about 65,000 people, is about 60 percent smaller than it was in 1960. Decades ago, blacks, Irish, Italians and Eastern Europeans came to work among the great blast furnaces of the old mills. When those businesses closed between 1977 and 1982, tens of thousands lost their jobs.Today there are still some metal industry and manufacturing jobs. There is a big General Motors plant north of town that produces the small Chevrolet Cruze sedan. There is a maximum-security prison that opened in 1998. There is a business incubator, focused on reimagining Youngstown as a hub for software and 3-D printing.In addition, there are signs of recovery from the Great Recession: The unemployment rate, which peaked at nearly 17 percent in January 2010, stood at 7.6 percent in June.There is also a widespread belief that Mr. Trump is right when he says that the United States must renegotiate the terms of its trade with the world.Mr. Strines said that he worked for years as a quality assurance superintendent in the aluminum business, making good money until health issues related to his drinking problem forced him to retire. In that time, he said, he saw many businesses go under because China could produce aluminum for a fraction of what it cost American companies. He is hoping Mr. Trump will institute more protective tariffs.\u201cI think he could bring the economy back,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a take-charge kind of guy.\u201dMr. Wasko huffed. He doubted that Mr. Trump would follow through on any of his promises. What about the border wall? Mr. Trump was never going to get Mexico to pay for that, he said. And anyhow, wasn\u2019t America great already?Mr. Strines said: \u201cYou think America is great? Come look for a job in Youngstown.\u2019\u2019Wendy Aron, 58, emerged from the speech energized. She was once a supporter of President Obama but was dismayed by the weakness of the post-recession recovery. Her housecleaning business in the Youngstown suburb of Boardman has shrunk, going from a dozen employees to a two-person operation: her and her daughter. Working people, she said, don\u2019t have the money to pay for maid service anymore.Many of her close friends remain Democrats. \u201cThey just put me down,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to even talk to them.\u201dGayle Hite, an employee at a hospital, and her husband, Joseph, were not invited to the speech, but got as close to it as they could, waiting outside a campus building with her wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d T-shirt.She is a longtime Republican, but her husband, who usually votes Democrat, was planning to vote for Mr. Trump this year. They had watched Mr. Trump slog through a tough couple of weeks, taking criticism for, among other things, his feud with the family of a slain Muslim American soldier. But what some saw as gaffes were, to Mr. Hite, proof that Mr. Trump was a true change agent.\u201cHe\u2019s not bought or sold by anybody,\u201d said Mr. Hite, a retired corrections officer. \u201cHe can say what he wants.\u201dThese days Mr. Hite, 64, receives a Social Security check, but he said he worried about the ways in which a volatile world might bankrupt the government. What would it cost to absorb Syrian refugees? And the immigrants coming across the Mexican border?\u201cIt shows we\u2019re not really running our country,\u201d Ms. Hite said. \u201cSometimes I don\u2019t believe our vote counts.\u201dIn Mr. Springsteen\u2019s song \u201cYoungstown,\u201d the narrator, a laid-off mill worker, wishes for a future not in heaven but in \u201cthe fiery furnaces of hell.\u201d The character was inspired, in part, by a real steelworker, Joe Marshall Jr., whom Mr. Springsteen had read about in a book.Today Mr. Marshall, a small, sturdy man, who turns 63 on Saturday, can be found in Columbus, living in a $500 apartment and drawing a full state pension. After the steel industry fell apart, he pursued a life in law enforcement. He is an ardent Trump supporter.\u201cHe says what the average person is afraid to say because it\u2019s politically incorrect,\u201d Mr. Marshall said about Mr. Trump.Mr. Marshall worked at the Mahoning County Sheriff\u2019s Office for 23 years, at the jail and on patrol \u2014 a front-row seat, he said, to the city\u2019s dramatic decline. He watched as the professional classes emptied out, and as the city\u2019s complexion changed: Youngstown, 74 percent white in 1970, is now about evenly divided between blacks and whites.Drugs came in, he said. The murder rate soared. Young people were dropping out of school at 15 years of age, Mr. Marshall said, because they didn\u2019t see what kinds of work a degree would get them.\u201cWhere are they going to go, Taco Bell?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat\u2019s minimum-wage jobs.\u201dSeven years ago, he moved away, taking a job as a corrections officer. Today, his political views are eclectic. The Democrats, he said, \u201cfailed Youngstown\u201d: During the steel days, they were the party of overbearing regulations, the ones who told management that they couldn\u2019t open a second blast furnace. \u201cThat\u2019s jobs they took away,\u201d he said.On Facebook, Mr. Marshall\u2019s posts extol the beauty of mixed-race families, and the contributions of African-Americans to the country\u2019s culture. But he is wary of the big mosque in his neighborhood and suspects Muslims there of planning an attack. The Democrats, he said, seem indifferent to whites.\u201cBelieve me, as Jesus Christ is my lord and savior, I\u2019m not prejudiced or anything,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it seems if you\u2019re a minority, they help you out a lot more than if you\u2019re white.\u201d\u201cHe was a good guy,\u201d Mr. Marshall said of Mr. Traficant, who had hired him personally. \u201cI remember he told me, \u2018You screw up, Marshall, I\u2019ll kill you.\u2019\u201dLike Mr. Trump, Mr. Traficant, who went by the nickname Jimbo, annoyed and defied members of both parties, dished out scathing personal insults, blasted Washington insiders and purported to speak for the average Joe. He proposed sending troops to secure the Mexican border and criticized free trade. He even sported a flamboyant and gravity-defying hairdo, though it proved to be a toupee.Back in Youngstown, the fondness for Mr. Traficant lingers despite allegations that he was tied to the mob.\u201cWell, the whole city was like that,\u201d said Kathy Miller, the Trump campaign coordinator for Mahoning County. She said it was difficult to agree with everything Mr. Traficant did, just as it is with Mr. Trump. But she said that Mr. Traficant\u2019s constituent services were unparalleled.\u201cJimbo got it taken care of,\u201d she said.Out in the parking lot, Mr. Strines seconded the praise. \u201cHe just told it the way it was, and I think Trump is the same type of guy as Traficant,\u201d he said.Mr. Strines even asserted that Youngstown had been a better, safer place when the mob was in control. So it would be, he said, in Mr. Trump\u2019s America.Once upon a time, he said, everybody in Youngstown knew that if someone messed up and failed to follow certain rules, \u201cthat\u2019s where the mob would step in.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s where Trump would step in,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce somebody\u2019s got fear, like Iraq will have, like China will have,\u201d he said, the world will grow calmer. \u201cAll of those illegal aliens better pack up their toothbrushes and start running.\u201dMr. Wasko wasn\u2019t buying it: \u201cSo let\u2019s instill fear in everyone in America,\u201d he said sarcastically.\u201cNo,\u201d Mr. Strines said, \u201conly the bad ones, man.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But thanks to in-class use of social media, the class also became a creative ferment of improvised dance, trust experiments and inquiries into the modern nature of the self and the crowd.The constant experimentation changed Mr. Goldsmith into a self-described \u201cradical optimist\u201d about the internet, too. While many of his peers worry about the effects that endless tweets and bad videos have on our minds and souls, he sees a positive new culture being built. The first poet laureate of the Museum of Modern Art, appointed in 2013, he believes we are headed into a creative renaissance, one with unprecedented speed and inclusion.Meanwhile, the class has evolved into a seminar on collective \u201ctime wasting\u201d that Mr. Goldsmith has held in several countries, and it returns to Penn this fall. His new book, named after the course, will be available this month.Why write this book?I had cognitive dissonance. Theorists say the internet is making us dumber, but something magical happened when my students wasted time together. They became more creative with each other.

They say we\u2019re not reading; I think we\u2019re reading all the time, just online.I\u2019m an artist, and artists feel things, we distrust these studies. As a poet I wanted to observe, I wanted to feel things.You compare online experiences with 20th-century philosophies and artistic movements.The DNA of the web is embedded in 20th-century movements like Surrealism, where artists sought to live in a state like dreaming, or Pop Art, where they leveraged popular culture to make bigger points about society. Postmodernism is about sampling things and remixing them, and that is made real in this digital world.When I teach my students about the historical preconditions for what they are doing when they waste time together \u2014 things like Surrealism or Cubism \u2014 the theoretical framework helps them know that the web isn\u2019t a break, it\u2019s a continuity with earlier great thinking.But if we\u2019re just remixing, are we creating?When a D.J. brings a laptop full of music samples to a club he doesn\u2019t play an instrument, but we don\u2019t argue that he isn\u2019t doing something creative in mixing those sounds to create his own effect. In the online world the only thing you\u2019re the master of is your collection, your archive, and how you use it, how you remix it. We become digital archivists, collecting and cataloging things. I find it exciting.What will an educated person be in the future?We still read great books, and there is a place for great universities. But an educated person in the future will be a curious person who collects better artifacts. The ability to call up and use facts is the new education. How to tap them, how to use them.

{"Headline": "How Many Guns Did the U.S. Lose Track of in Iraq and Afghanistan? Hundreds of Thousands.", "Date": "2016-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNotebookEarly this year, a Facebook user in Baghdad using the name Hussein Mahyawi posted a photograph of a slightly worn M4 assault rifle he was offering for sale. Veterans of the latest war in Iraq immediately recognized it. It was a standard American carbine equipped with a holographic sight, a foregrip that was military-issue during the occupation and a sticker bearing a digital QR code used by American forces for inventory control. Except for one detail \u2014 an aftermarket pistol grip, the sort of accessory with which combatants of the current generation often pimp their guns \u2014 it was a dead ringer for any of the tens of thousands of M4s the Pentagon handed out to Iraqi security forces and various armed militias after toppling Saddam Hussein in 2003. And here it was on the open market, ready for bids.Was this a surprise? No. A little more than four years after the United States withdrew all its military forces from Iraq, and not quite two years after a smaller number of American troops began returning to the country to help fight the Islamic State, the open sale of such an M4 was part of Iraq\u2019s day-to-day arms-trafficking routine. Mahyawi\u2019s carbine was another data point attesting to an extraordinary and dangerous failure of American arms-trafficking and public accountability and to a departure from a modern military\u2019s most basic practice: keeping track of the guns.Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the United States has handed out a vast but persistently uncountable quantity of military firearms to its many battlefield partners in Afghanistan and Iraq. Today the Pentagon has only a partial idea of how many weapons it issued, much less where these weapons are. Meanwhile, the effectively bottomless abundance of black-market weapons from American sources is one reason Iraq will not recover from its post-invasion woes anytime soon.An inkling of just how expansive these arms transfers were, and how stubbornly resistant they are to precise measurement, is apparent in a new attempt at weapons-tallying compiled in a project led by Iain Overton. Overton is a former BBC journalist who is now the executive director of Action on Armed Violence, a charity based in London that researches and lobbies against weapons proliferation and violence against civilians; he is also the author of \u201cThe Way of the Gun,\u201d a dark examination of some of the roles firearms play in modern society. With a string of Freedom of Information Act requests that began last year, he and his small team of researchers pooled 14 years\u2019 worth of Pentagon contract information related to rifles, pistols, machine guns and their associated attachments and ammunition, both for American troops and for their partners and proxies. They then crosschecked the data against other public records. Overton is releasing the data and his analysis today. It covers 412 contracts and merits pause for reflection as the parties to the international Arms Trade Treaty gather this week in Geneva. The treaty, which took effect in 2014 and of which the United States is a signatory, is intended to promote transparency and responsible action in the transfer of conventional arms and to reduce their diversion to unintended hands \u2014 exactly what the United States often failed to do in recent wars.In all, Overton found, the Pentagon provided more than 1.45 million firearms to various security forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, including more than 978,000 assault rifles, 266,000 pistols and almost 112,000 machine guns. These transfers formed a collage of firearms of mixed vintage and type: Kalashnikov assault rifles left over from the Cold War; recently manufactured NATO-standard M16s and M4s from American factories; machine guns of Russian and Western lineage; and sniper rifles, shotguns and pistols of varied provenance and caliber, including a large order of Glock semiautomatic pistols, a type of weapon also regularly offered for sale online in Iraq.Many of the recipients of these weapons became brave and important battlefield allies. But many more did not. Taken together, the weapons were part of a vast and sometimes minimally supervised flow of arms from a superpower to armies and militias often compromised by poor training, desertion, corruption and patterns of human rights abuses. Knowing what we know about many of these forces, it would have been remarkable for them to retain custody of many of their weapons. It is not surprising that they did not.As an illustration of how haphazard the supervision of this arms distribution often was, last week, five months after being asked by The New York Times for its own tally of small arms issued to partner forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Pentagon said it has records for fewer than half the number of firearms in the researchers\u2019 count \u2014 about 700,000 in all. This is an amount, Overton noted, that \u201conly accounts for 48 percent of the total small arms supplied by the U.S. government that can be found in open-source government reports.\u201dThis gap between the tallies, the Pentagon said, is partly because at first the United States military was trying to stand up to two governments that were busily fighting wars. \u201cSpeed was essential in getting those nations\u2019 security forces armed, equipped and trained to meet these extreme challenges,\u201d Mark Wright, a Pentagon spokesman, wrote in an email. \u201cAs a result, lapses in accountability of some of the weapons transferred occurred.\u201d Wright also said that the Pentagon\u2019s current practices have improved, and that to ensure \u201cthat equipment is only used for authorized purposes,\u201d its representatives \u201cinventory each weapon as it arrives in country and record the distribution of the weapon to the foreign partner nation.\u201dWhy counting weapons, and making a record of serial numbers and recipients, was seen as so time-consuming that it would have slowed down war is not clear. Anyone who has served in a military unit knows that documenting who received what weapon is both a fundamental task and a habit that fits easily into a routine. It takes no more time than issuing a uniform to a soldier or feeding him a meal. But often the Pentagon did not require these steps \u2014 although Wright noted that once a weapon is provided to another force, \u201cIt is their responsibility to account for that weapon.\u201dThe weapons sent from Europe to Iraq, and the crates of ammunition necessary to keep them fed, filled cargo planes \u2014 though Marsh said the available data also does not say how many were directly paid for by the United States, as opposed to those bought by Iraqi ministries with American-donated funds or those donated by countries unloading old stock. This is an important observation, because the latter two categories \u2013 state-to-state gifts via American handlers or otherwise and firearms purchased directly by Afghanistan or Iraq \u2014 might not be in Overton\u2019s final count. This is one of many reasons to suspect that the 1.45 million tally might understate the real quantity of weapons disbursements during a long run of years when the Pentagon played the role in Afghanistan and Iraq of small-arms provider. \u201cIt could be twice as much, as far as we know,\u201d Overton said last Friday, not entirely in jest.Overton\u2019s analysis also does not account for many weapons issued by the American military to local forces by other means, including the reissue of captured weapons, which was a common and largely undocumented practice.Adding to the suspicion that the number is even larger, Overton is certain that his tally missed shipments, because the data that the Defense Department made available was incomplete or laden with contradictions that were not readily reconciled. For example, the contracts it released were for more than $6.5 million or $7 million, depending on the year. Overton suspects that this hides many smaller purchases. And the contract data often labeled purchases vaguely, sometimes making it difficult to determine exactly what was bought, much less for whom. The Pentagon\u2019s data, in short, did not declare much of what the Pentagon actually bought.One point is inarguable: Many of these weapons did not remain long in government possession after arriving in their respective countries. In one of many examples, a 2007 Government Accountability Office report found that 110,000 Kalashnikov assault rifles and 80,000 pistols bought by the United States for Iraq\u2019s security forces could not be accounted for \u2014 more than one firearm for every member of the entire American military force in Iraq at any time during the war. Those documented lapses of accountability were before entire Iraqi divisions simply vanished from the battlefield, as four of them did after the Islamic State seized Mosul and Tikrit in 2014, according to a 2015 Army budget request to buy more firearms for the Iraqi forces to replace what was lost.Certain lines in Overton\u2019s spreadsheets hint at profound tactical shifts. The United States military entered Afghanistan in 2001 with a small contingent of troops, who pushed the Taliban from power by maneuvering with local allies supported by naval and air-to-ground firepower. It invaded Iraq in 2003 with mechanized columns protected by an overpowering rollout of fire support, including airstrikes, cruise missiles, incendiary bombs and cluster submunitions. The combination swiftly routed Iraq\u2019s conventional forces. Then came years of occupation duty and efforts at reconstruction and nation-building across a sprawling geography. Rotations of soldiers and Marines became bogged down in changing missions and faced the familiar threats of guerrilla warfare reborn \u2014 roadside bombs, ambushes and (in Iraq, particularly) snipers.The data show large purchases of heavy-machine guns and barrels. This is a wink at the shift in many American units from being foot-mobile to vehicular, as grunts buttoned up within armored trucks and needed turret-mounted firepower to defend themselves \u2014 a mat\u00e9riel adaptation forced by ambushes and improvised bombs, the cheaply made weapons that wearied the most expensive military in the world.Now look away from the data for a moment to consider what it does not show. The Pentagon provided Overton with contract information on small arms up to a caliber of 30 millimeters. This meant that certain classes of infantry weapons were not included, among them mortars, shoulder-fired rockets and powerful Mark 19 automatic grenade launchers that were mounted on many American vehicles and also used in outpost defense. That omission means the data offer no insight into a startlingly risky aspect of the Pentagon\u2019s arming of local forces with infantry arms: the wide distribution of anti-armor weapons, including RPG-7s, commonly called rocket-propelled grenades, and recoilless weapons, including the SPG-9. Each of these systems fires high-explosive (and often armor-piercing) projectiles, and each was commonly used by insurgents in attacks. After the opening weeks of each war, the only armor on either battlefield was American or associated with allied and local government units, which made the Pentagon\u2019s practice of providing anti-armor weapons to Afghan and Iraqi security forces puzzling. Why would they need anti-armor weapons when they had no armor to fight? All the while rockets were somehow mysteriously being fired at American convoys and patrols in each war.All together, the sheer size of the expenditures, the sustained confusion about totals and the multiple pressures eroding the stock combine to create a portrait of the Pentagon\u2019s bungling the already-awkward role it chose for itself \u2014 that of state-building arms dealer, a role that routinely led to missions in clear opposition to each other. While fighting two rapidly evolving wars, the American military tried to create and bolster new democracies, governments and political classes; recruit, train and equip security and intelligence forces on short schedule and at outsize scale; repair and secure transportation infrastructure; encourage the spread or restoration of the legal industry and public services; and leave behind something more palatable and sturdy than rule by thugs.Any one of these efforts would be difficult on its own. But the United States was trying all these things at once while buying and flying into both countries a prodigious quantity of light military weapons and handing them out to local people and outfits it barely knew. The recipients were often manifestly corrupt and sometimes had close ties to the same militias and insurgents who were trying to drive out the United States and make sure its entire nation-building project did not stand. It should not have been a surprise that American units in disaffected provinces and neighborhoods, and their partners, could encounter gunfire at every turn.The procession of arms purchases and handouts has continued to this day, with others involved, including Iran to its allies in Iraq and various donors to Kurdish fighters. In March, Russia announced that it had given 10,000 Kalashnikov assault rifles to Afghanistan, already one of the most Kalashnikov-saturated places on earth. If an analysis from the United States\u2019 Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, or Sigar, is to be believed, Afghanistan did not even need them. In 2014 the inspector general reported that after the United States decided to replace the Afghan Army\u2019s Kalashnikovs with NATO-standard weapons (a boon for the rifles\u2019 manufacturer with a much less obvious value for an already amply armed Afghan force), the Afghan Army ended up with a surplus of more than 83,000 Kalashnikovs. The United States never tried to recover the excess it had created, giving the inspector general\u2019s office grounds for long-term worry. \u201cWithout confidence in the Afghan government\u2019s ability to account for or properly dispose of these weapons,\u201d it noted, \u201cSigar is concerned that they could be obtained by insurgents and pose additional risks to civilians.\u201dUltimately, Overton\u2019s tallying of the weapons rollout serves as another reminder of a fundamental institutional disconnect between what the Pentagon expects of its troops and it expects of itself. From their earliest days in uniform, Army and Marine recruits are drilled in the near sanctity of their rifles. They quickly learn that no other item of standard equipment will be more rigidly tracked in the routines of accountability and that inspections will continue throughout their careers. Rifles are to be kept properly lubricated and spotlessly clean. Rifles are to be always at hand. Rifles are to be pointed only where meant to be pointed. Rifles are never to be lost. Everything in the armory and each patrol is to be counted, again and again (and again), so that everyone from private to commander knows that nothing has been misplaced and that the weapons are ready for whatever lies ahead. So thorough does this mentality take hold that more than a few veterans, years after returning to civilian life, can recite the serial numbers of service rifles they carried. Some find themselves involuntarily reaching for rifles throughout the day.When the military distributed weapons in Afghanistan and Iraq, a different dynamic was in play. Keeping track of the weapons in any reliable fashion \u2014 documenting who got what and what went where \u2014 was often not a priority. It is impossible today. And so no one knows where many of the weapons are, until they turn up on social media or announce themselves in combat or crime with the crack of incoming fire, a reminder of tens of billions of dollars gone into nations where violence and terrorism continue apace. What to do? If past is precedent, given enough time one of the United States\u2019 solutions will be, once again, to ship in more guns.C.J. Chivers is a reporter for The Times.Advertisement"}

To different degrees, we have all been guilty of cryptomnesia. And in a world flooded with information, we are especially prone to forgetting where ideas originated.\u201cIt\u2019s a common error that we all do, all the time,\u201d she said.Psychologists think cryptomnesia happens when we fail to register the source of information \u2014 what\u2019s known as a source-monitoring error. As our brains amass memories, details are ranked. In this filtering process, the origins of facts often fall secondary to the facts themselves.Cryptomnesia may actually be a byproduct of an otherwise efficient memory system, Dr. Gingerich said. \u201cIf you think about it, it\u2019s not very cognitively efficient to remember every single detail of everything that happens to us.\u201dLater, the researchers asked participants to recall the items they had come up with, and to brainstorm new examples. In both tasks, nearly three-fourths named at least one item that someone else in the group had already mentioned. Plagiarized responses accounted for 7 percent to 9 percent of the total.In other experiments, Dr. Dow found that novices were more likely to commit accidental plagiarism than experts, and that people were more prone to cryptomnesia when multitasking.As people are bombarded with more and more material, \u201chow we store that information is so much more challenging,\u201d Dr. Gingerich said.\u201cYou scroll through a Facebook feed,\u201d she added, \u201cand there\u2019s an infinite number of pieces of information coming from so many different sources.\u201dThere\u2019s no need to question yourself in real time, but to remember to go back deliberately, he added. \u201cI don\u2019t think musicians should sit there, play a chord sequence and go, \u201cWell, that probably sounds like something else,\u2019 \u201d he said.Instead, every now and then, check each piece of information or material. \u201cAsk yourself: \u2018Where did I get this information from? Is it mine? Did I borrow it from someone else? Have I accurately shared the source?\u2019 \u201dIt may be harder for musicians, because they\u2019re \u201cdrawing on all sorts of different things,\u201d Dr. Landau acknowledged.

I was 13, and I liked to wear the skirt of that godawful Peruvian school uniform above my knees. I loved my legs, and I had recently waxed them for the first time. It was Lima in the 1990s, I was crossing a street avoiding illegally parked cars shining under weak rays of sunshine and I did not even see it coming. All I felt was a burst of discomfort, a whiplash of shame. A hand slightly raising the skirt, brushing my thigh, trying to reach me. It lasted a few seconds. Like every time I experienced a \u201cmetida de mano\u201d \u2014 a local institution of sexual harassment \u2014 I froze and muted an agonized scream.I should have kept walking, dragging my helplessness like any other woman groped in the middle of the street, but I decided to react. He was an older man, bald, who was quietly walking away without looking at me after his \u201cimpish\u201d deed. I did not think long: I ran after him and raised my school backpack with both arms, and with all my strength I slammed it on his head. I flew out of there howling to the heavens my humble revenge.A Peruvian girl is a full-time Little Red Riding Hood. Quite early she learns she has to take this, and not that other, road; that she must watch her back, and feign that she did not hear what they shouted about her vagina.Any man alone at the end of a street is a potential Big Bad Wolf. A taxi: your last trip. Drinking at a party: gambling with your life. To desire: to be a whore. When I wrote a book about sex I got a flood of comments from men threatening to rape me so I would learn. My amazing boss came to the office once with a black eye. My ex-boyfriend broke my nose because he saw me and a girlfriend of mine kissing. I needed nose surgery.A Peruvian woman seldom has the opportunity to react, because self-defense for a woman means rape and murder. The law treats her as the rapist did: Even her miniskirt may justify the crime in court. It is like being raped twice.The day arrives when Red Riding Hood rebels, without turning back. This is what has happened in Peru these past few weeks. Women have taken that backpack in which we carried years of macho violence and smacked society on the head with it.The day we rebelled was a normal day, with its number of women victimized. We were particularly stricken by Lady Gill\u00e9n\u2019s case, disfigured by her boyfriend. But the trigger was Arlette Contreras\u2019s video, in which her naked, drunk boyfriend drags her by her hair through an inn\u2019s corridors.You could finally see what we all, men and women, knew was going on behind closed doors.The outrage was channeled through a Facebook group, #NiUnaMenos. Its goal was to facilitate a large mass demonstration in the streets of Lima, and replicate the impact of protests in Buenos Aires and Mexico City. Something astonishing happened: thousands of women shared their testimonies of violence. They uploaded pictures of their bruises, their scars, their bloodshot and teary eyes. They named their victimizers. It is historic, it is painful, but it also fills you with hope to see how thousands of Peruvian women lost their fear and decided to unite.It is worth remembering that 300,000 women were forcibly sterilized during the dictatorship of Alberto Fujimori. A case that was just shelved.The key to reversing this situation is a new penal code, and to improve the response level of the judiciary system. Hence the need to educate public servants with a focus on gender, to increase the budget for protection, the creation of an Observatory on Violence Against Women and outreach centers for emergencies. A Commission for Gender Justice in the Supreme Court was announced to guarantee nondiscriminatory treatment. A national campaign to uproot the causes of gender violence is a pressing demand.Inspired by #NiUnaMenos, the government of the previous president, Ollanta Humala, in spite of having done so very little for women\u2019s rights, approved a National Plan Against Gender Violence. The government of the current president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski\u2019, has the responsibility to implement it.We went from the social networks to the streets, and from anger we organized.On Aug. 13, Lima\u2019s downtown streets overflowed with women. Many of the abuse survivors, some in wheelchairs because of their partners\u2019 beatings, headed the march and read their testimonies in front of the palace that many in Peru don\u2019t call \u201cof Justice\u201d but \u201cof injustice.\u201d There were also huge demonstrations in Cusco, Trujillo and Iquitos; and in 30 capital cities throughout the world. We now have an app that allows women to report harassment and assaults using their cellphones.Has #NiUnaMenos changed something? Yes, all of it. The process it started is unprecedented and will have social repercussions we can barely guess, but from the moment women in Peru named the mistreatment we suffered in our community, as in a spell, we cast evil a bit away, so there would be not one fewer of us. The day we rebelled is not over, it has just begun.Gabriela Wiener is a Peruvian reporter and writer based in Madrid.Advertisement"}

If deception were a sport, Trump would be the Olympic gold medalist; Clinton would be an honorable mention at her local Y.Let\u2019s investigate.Likewise, The Washington Post Fact-Checker has awarded its worst ranking, Four Pinocchios, to 16 percent of Clinton\u2019s statements that it checked and to 64 percent of Trump\u2019s.\u201cEssentially, Clinton is in the norm for a typical politician,\u201d says Glenn Kessler, who runs Fact-Checker, while Trump \u201cis just off the charts. There\u2019s never been anyone like him, at least in the six years I have been doing this.\u201dWhen I speak with Trump voters, they often argue that Clinton is an inveterate liar and crook, yet when pressed they draw from the same handful of examples.But it\u2019s also true that as the plane prepared to descend, security officials gave a spine-chilling briefing of the risks of sniper fire, and Clinton wore body armor in case of shooting.All this is junior varsity mendacity. In contrast, Trump is the champ of prevarication.If Clinton declares that she didn\u2019t chop down a cherry tree, that might mean that she actually used a chain saw to cut it down. Or that she ordered an aide to chop it down. As for Trump, he will insist, \u201cI absolutely did not chop down that cherry tree,\u201d even as he clutches the ax with which he chopped it down moments earlier on Facebook Live.In short, Clinton is about average for a politician in dissembling, while Trump is a world champion who is pathological in his dishonesty.

But Mr. Daleel\u2019s case has brought home to Germans the danger of former fighters, from any of the numerous sides in Syria\u2019s multicornered conflict, who have arrived along with civilians.As he sought asylum in Europe, Mr. Daleel appears to have either embellished or omitted key parts of his history in constantly shifting accounts.\u201cBased on what we know right now, it is not clear when he radicalized,\u201d Joachim Herrmann, interior minister for Bavaria, said this week. \u201cThere is the possibility that he self-radicalized; there is a possibility that he was radicalized a long time ago, perhaps even years ago.\u201dDocuments show that Mr. Daleel entered Europe illegally in July 2013 through Bulgaria, where he arrived with a Sony Xperia mobile phone and charger, two two-gigabyte memory cards, two sets of earbuds, a one-gigabyte flash drive and eight $100 bills.One of the people Mr. Daleel turned to for help when he arrived in Europe was Iliana Savova, director of the program for legal protection of refugees and migrants at the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee, a human-rights organization. In her office in Sofia, Bulgaria, she confirmed that Mr. Daleel was one of 290 asylum seekers who had appealed to the organization for help in November 2013. Mr. Daleel told the organization that he had no money and nowhere to live, and that he required medical treatment for his knee.\u201cI particularly remember this case because we don\u2019t see people with shell fragments in their legs very often,\u201d Ms. Savova said. \u201cHe told us he got the fragments in his legs when a shell exploded in his house and killed his wife and children.\u201dA look at the lives of 247 men, women and children who were cut down in mass killings in six countries.Mr. Daleel did not claim he had been tortured during the two months he was detained in Bulgaria, as he later told the German authorities. The Bulgarian authorities said they knew of no abuse. Mr. Daleel showed them shrapnel wounds on his legs. But they noted no signs of psychological instability or indications of radicalization.Mr. Daleel was granted asylum, but was unable to get the medical treatment he sought. He then flew to Austria, where he again applied for asylum in the spring of 2014. The application was rejected because he had protection in Bulgaria.Several months later, he went on to Germany. Here, he first made the claim that he had been abused in Bulgaria to Axel von Maltitz, a therapist in the southwestern city of Lindau, who, along with his wife, Gisela, runs an association that offers counseling to victims of trauma and to refugees.The couple refused to accept the idea of Mr. Daleel as a terrorist who supported the Islamic State.\u201cHe was a very calm, very pleasant patient, without any further problems,\u201d Ms. von Maltitz said in a telephone interview. \u201cHe would always come punctually with his bicycle on the train.\u201dMr. Daleel received six sessions from her husband over the course of a year starting in January 2015, she said. He had been granted another session for the end of July, but was left on his own in the meantime.Ms. von Maltitz refused to comment on his motives. \u201cThis simply doesn\u2019t fit into the picture of the patient who we knew,\u201d she said.Last year, a German volunteer who works with refugees brought Mr. Daleel\u2019s case to the attention of a lawmaker, Harald Weinberg, who holds a seat for the Left party in the German Parliament. Mr. Weinberg wrote to the authorities in Ansbach on Nov. 15, urging them to allow Mr. Daleel to stay, saying that Mr. Daleel had been hospitalized \u201cseveral times\u201d for psychological treatment and was suicidal after being ordered to return to Bulgaria.On July 24, Mr. Daleel detonated a bomb in his backpack at the music festival, wounding 15 and killing himself.A video found on his phone showed a masked man claiming to be Mr. Daleel, but using a nom de guerre and swearing allegiance to the Islamic State. It was later also circulated by the terrorist group. Federal prosecutors took over the case because of the apparent terrorism links, although Mr. Daleel had been unknown to them before the attack.The Islamic State called Mr. Daleel a soldier, too, but in his case, it also provided a long account of his ties to the group, including as a fighter in Aleppo, Syria. Last week, the group said Mr. Daleel had first joined its ranks in Iraq and later fought in Syria, \u201cwhere he was injured by shrapnel of a mortar.\u201dAfter seeking treatment in Europe, it said, Mr. Daleel wanted to return to Syria to fight but was unable to do so, and instead \u201cstarted creating accounts\u201d on the internet to support the Islamic State.The German police say Mr. Daleel opened six Facebook accounts, at least one of which was under a false name.The Islamic State also claimed that Mr. Daleel had studied how to make a bomb for three months, was in contact with a handler and had visited the site of the attack the day before.Even before the attack, Germany had tightened laws to register and share data about newly arriving refugees. It has also been sending out teams of customs officers or soldiers to locate unregistered asylum seekers.The teams record basic personal information and country of birth, and take biometric photos and fingerprints, said Andrea Brinkmann, a spokeswoman for the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees. Those are checked against the domestic intelligence office\u2019s databases and data on refugees already registered elsewhere in the European Union. Since February, all offices dealing with refugees, from the border police to state and local officials, have been able to review that information.But whether those steps will be sufficient remains to seen. Officials and humanitarian groups say they have long tried to balance the protection of refugees against security.\u201cThe challenge, then,\u201d said Elizabeth Collett, director of the Migration Policy Institute Europe, \u201cis to find those individuals who may have had different motivations, and those whose motivations may have changed since they arrived.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "When Every Company Is a Tech Company, Does the Label Matter?", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesApple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon have created something of a watershed moment in the stock market.They became the four most valuable companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index at the close of trading on Aug. 1, according to S.&P.\u2019s official tally. That meant that tech companies, by one common definition, occupied the four top spots in the market capitalization rankings, a rare and brief occurrence.\u201cIt may never have happened before at the close of trading,\u201d said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. The full history of daily rankings isn\u2019t readily available, however, so we can\u2019t be certain, and such rankings are evanescent, shifting with every tick of the stock market. In fact, on Friday, Amazon dropped back into sixth place.But no matter: The early August rankings were a reminder of how far tech has come. It is a dominant force in the stock market and the economy, one so all-encompassing that tech may no longer even be a useful concept for understanding today\u2019s stock market.One of them is Exxon Mobil, the energy giant and the most valuable company in the S.&P. as recently as 2012. But Exxon Mobil has been cut down in size by the oil price debacle. The other is Berkshire Hathaway, Warren E. Buffett\u2019s conglomerate, which the S.&P. categorizes as a financial services company \u2014 the only such company left in the Top 10 market cap list. Berkshire announced its own earnings after trading closed on Friday. We\u2019ll soon learn whether the market is pleased enough to vault Berkshire further ahead of Amazon.The three tech companies at the very top in market cap \u2014 Apple, Google and Microsoft \u2014 have held high positions for a long while. (Google, ranked second, trades as Alphabet, the name of its parent company.) Google passed Apple in value briefly this year, but Apple regained the top perch, which it has held since 2012. Microsoft, now No. 3, was the most valuable company during the last tech boom, in the early 2000s.Virtually no one disputes S.&P.\u2019s formal classification of Apple, Google and Microsoft as \u201cinformation technology\u201d companies. The same is true of Facebook, which held seventh place in the latest list of most valuable companies. But while Amazon is often described as a tech company \u2014 and undoubtedly uses and creates innovative technology \u2014 S.&P. has never classified it as one.In fact, Amazon is formally known as a \u201cconsumer discretionary company,\u201d like Walmart, which it has displaced as a member of the Top 10 most valuable companies. Amazon is the only consumer discretionary company left in the Top 10. Is it in some sense a tech company? Certainly, and we\u2019ll get back to that.But the same can be said, to one degree or another, about the three other members of the Top 10 \u2014 old companies that are still prospering in large part because of their mastery of advanced technologies. Johnson & Johnson, for example, which is ranked eighth, is a health care company, yet it is heavily involved in technology of a biological kind. Then there is General Electric, the diversified industrial company (and, until recently, also a financial services company), once described as a bellwether for the entire market. It conducts advanced research and sells tech products.Last on the list is AT&T, a telecommunications company, which, in an early form, helped create computer languages and operating systems on which modern tech companies are built. In 1957, when the S.&P. 500 was born, an ancestral version of AT&T was the most valuable company in the United States by a very wide margin, said Jeremy J. Siegel, a Wharton business school professor, the author of \u201cStocks for the Long Run\u201d and a market historian.\u201cAT&T back then was a highly regulated old phone company,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a giant, later broken up into smaller companies. And it was an outlier, because the other big companies in the S.&P. 500 in that era were mainly materials companies \u2014 like United States Steel, DuPont and Union Carbide \u2014 and an awful lot of oil companies.\u201dIn 1957, the economy ran on oil, and the biggest energy company was Standard Oil of New Jersey \u2014 an ancestor of Exxon Mobil. No pure tech company ranked in the Top 10 back then, not even IBM, which soon became the dominant tech company, a position it held until Microsoft surpassed it in the mid-1990s. That was the decade of the great tech boom, culminating in the bubble that burst in March 2000. Microsoft was No. 1 in market cap at the end of 1999, and four other tech companies \u2014 Cisco Systems, Intel, IBM and America Online \u2014 were also among the Top 10 most valuable companies. The stock market celebrated tech\u2019s ascendance then, as it does now.But this is a different era. When you dig deeper into the S.&P. 500, it\u2019s clear that while the valuations of tech companies swelled to unrealistically high proportions in those bubble years, the valuations of most companies are far more modest now. In March 2000, the height of the bubble, the value of information technology companies swelled to 34.5 percent of the total market cap of the S.&P. 500. At the moment, the comparable figure is only 20.7 percent, data from the Bespoke Investment Group shows. That\u2019s not much more than the 15.7 percent share of financial companies or the 15.2 percent share of the health care sector. By contrast, finance ballooned as high as 22.3 percent at the end of 2006, in what can be seen in hindsight as a financial bubble.On the other hand, materials and energy companies, which together constituted almost half of the total value of the S.&P. 500 in 1957, now account for less than 10 percent of it. That reflects the collapse of energy and commodity prices over the last few years, and it may well be a temporary phenomenon. In the meantime, diversified energy companies like Exxon Mobil are investing heavily in technology, a necessity if they are to flourish.It\u2019s clear even to energy companies, in other words, that tech\u2019s abiding power in the marketplace is not temporary. Technology permeates every sector of the economy, even those not formally classified as high-tech. Whether companies like Amazon and Johnson & Johnson should carry tech labels is beside the point. Tech has already taken over.These days every company is a tech company, but some have better niches, faster growth, more attractive offerings or more favorable share prices than others. These kinds of fundamental distinctions will influence the Top 10 rankings of the future.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

But if students know that a college is looking for essays that reflect their ability to empathize with others, they will comply with the mandate, whether or not they are altruistic.If admissions personnel are looking only for students who can append a list of public service activities to their applications, they will exclude those who, for various reasons, cannot work part time or travel to Guatemala to paint houses. Some of the excluded may be too busy studying, hoping that their grades and letters of recommendation will speak for themselves.If college applicants are lacking in public service, it does not mean that they have no sense of empathy (which is becoming one of the most abused words in public discourse).Dispense with the essay, and use personal interviews, if necessary, for borderline cases.

There are many factors they could consider instead, like standardized tests (favoring those with resources) or donations (which they value most from alumni).Encouraging high school students to volunteer is, I think, like asking them to read great works of literature.

They had only known a world where another fund-raise was just around the corner.\u201dSilicon Valley start-ups were set to face a great reckoning in 2016. Yet the crash hasn\u2019t happened.The worst fallout may yet come, but many of the start-ups have hung on. Across Silicon Valley, engineers are still commanding annual salaries that average $136,000, according to Hired, a recruiting firm. Demand is brisk for $4 buttered toast, and office space rents remain near record highs. The biggest start-ups, like Uber and Airbnb, continue to land billions of dollars in funding. And investors are shoveling money into venture capital funds, which raised so much cash in the first half of this year that it rivaled the amount raised in all of 2015.For all of the hand-wringing, \u201cthere just hasn\u2019t been much of a downturn,\u201d said Paul Buchheit, a managing partner at Y Combinator, a prominent start-up incubator that nurtured companies including Dropbox and Airbnb. \u201cI don\u2019t even see many companies going out of business.\u201dYet it is precisely these adaptations that have allowed many Silicon Valley start-ups to stick it out \u2014 for now, at least.\u201cThe start-up world did heed the warnings,\u201d said Max Levchin, a former employee and a founder of PayPal and the chief executive of Affirm, a lending start-up in San Francisco.For techies who have been grappling with the not-yet-a-crash environment, the adjustment in their outlook is evident in their speech. Entrepreneurs who once talked about how fast their start-ups were growing are now spouting from a bible of fiscal responsibility.Sean Behr, the chief executive of the parking service Zirx, epitomizes the change. The company, named after the Ukrainian word for star, was in the \u201con-demand\u201d space, providing valet parking with the touch of a smartphone button. Mr. Behr said his goal was to make all of Zirx\u2019s consumers feel like stars.But each customer was so expensive to acquire and serve that Zirx lost money and consumers in all six cities where it operated. By late last year, Zirx, a San Francisco start-up that had raised $36 million, had only about a year\u2019s worth of cash left.So in January, Mr. Behr, 41, walked his employees through nearly 40 PowerPoint slides detailing the company\u2019s precarious finances and explained that Zirx needed to take drastic actions. That month, he told customers Zirx was shutting down its on-demand businesses where valets would park cars for any customer who asked and would instead focus on more lucrative corporate clients.\u201cInvestors used to say grow, grow, grow and don\u2019t worry about costs,\u201d Mr. Behr said. \u201cNow you\u2019re encouraged to not run out of money and make sure you\u2019ll be around.\u201dToday, Zirx is profitable in eight of its nine markets, he said. The company has preserved $10 million from its last financing round to keep in the bank for a rainier day.At Bannerman, a 16-person security guard start-up based in San Francisco, Johnny Chin, the chief executive, also narrowed the company\u2019s focus after warnings of a crash. While the start-up once pursued several types of customers, it began concentrating on serving only medium-size offices and property managers.The company was losing money last year, but it is now profitable. Start-ups \u201cstarted to cut their most frivolous spending,\u201d said Mr. Chin, 30. \u201cPeople are just cautious. It\u2019s healthier.\u201dOther entrepreneurs have a newfound air of practicality, no longer shooting for their companies to be the next tech behemoth like Facebook.Ken Denman, chief executive of the artificial intelligence start-up Emotient, was trying to drum up more money for his company last year when he heard the talk about a coming start-up calamity. So to hedge his bets, he started talking to potential buyers, too.\u201cIn 2013, I wouldn\u2019t have thought about selling,\u201d said Mr. Denman, 58. But all the concerns \u201cencouraged folks to behave in whatever way would give them the greatest chance to succeed.\u201dIn January, he sold his four-year-old company for an undisclosed amount to Apple, where most of his team now works. \u201cI looked at all the variables and wanted to do what was the best thing for the employees and the company,\u201d said Mr. Denman, who is taking a break after the sale.While there has been no crash since then, he does not regret any prognostications. He said he was glad if young companies had stopped overspending because of his warnings.\u201cFunding for just anything under the sun has gone away,\u201d Mr. Gurley said. \u201cI spoke out because the longer those things go on, the worse things end up later on.

Elsewhere, the song is having a very different effect.\u201cIt is driving me crazy,\u201d said Jason DeBord, a 45-year-old living in Ann Arbor, Mich. \u201cI hit the mute button, or I make dinner, or I just sit there and brace myself.\u201dDeBord has nothing against displays of patriotism, nor is he simply eager to return to the action. What irritates him is the version of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d being used at the Olympics. Put bluntly, it has been butchered.O.K., that might overstate the problem. Maybe it would be more accurate to say the song has been altered in ways that rob it of its oomph, its power and its optimistic essence.Specifically, DeBord said, this \u201cBanner\u201d segues several times to minor chords, which in the Western canon are considered melancholic, in places where major chords, which are heartier and more upbeat, are the norm. The effect, DeBord said, is a rendering of the anthem that is darker and sadder.\u201cIt has a totally different emotional feel,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is supposed to have an ascending chord structure. Instead, it sort of has a descending chord structure.\u201dIn short, this is a defeatist \u201cStar-Spangled Banner,\u201d and it is broadcast, around the globe, at a moment of ecstatic, international triumph.DeBord, who spent 16 years on Broadway as a conductor and pianist, is on the faculty at the University of Michigan\u2019s department of musical theater. He is the first to admit that few people are likely to notice, let alone be bothered by, the elements of the song that annoy him.

Lots of perturbed company.\u201cGlad it\u2019s not just me,\u201d one commenter wrote.Another person posted: \u201cSounds like a music school project gone awry. Just awful.\u201d16 Photos\u201cI\u2019m not on Twitter,\u201d someone else added, \u201cbut there must be a way to tell \u2018them\u2019!!!\u201dAsked for the particulars of his beef with this \u201cBanner,\u201d DeBord offered to head to the piano in his home and provide a live tutorial, over the phone. He quickly plowed through the beginning of the song \u2014 \u201cO say, can you see, by the dawn\u2019s early light\u201d \u2014 but stopped when he got to \u201cWhat so proudly we hailed.\u201dAt \u201cproudly,\u201d he noted, the Olympic version of the anthem goes to one of those sad, dark minor chords where majors have long been the norm. He played the standard version and then the Olympic version \u2014 standard, Olympic, over and over. Once he pointed out the difference, it was obvious. The Olympic version was conciliatory, maybe even retreating. The standard version was chest-thumping and on the offense.\u201cIt happens again on \u2018rockets\u2019 red glare,\u2019\u201d he said, hands on the piano, \u201cand then again on \u2018land of the free.\u2019\u201dThere is no official or definitive version of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner,\u201d and that is no accident. The 1931 bill signed into law by President Herbert Hoover that adopted the song as the nation\u2019s anthem is a model of terseness. It is mum about both lyrics and arrangement, which, said Mark Clague, an associate professor of musicology at the University of Michigan, is one reason the anthem has continued to evolve over the years.\u201cWhen Francis Scott Key wrote it, he\u2019d just seen a decisive victory in Baltimore in the War of 1812, which was like a second war of independence,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cHe writes the song in celebration, and it\u2019s played for years with a celebratory feel, up-tempo and light. Only later does it become the song we know, slower and more majestic.\u201dClague, who is working on a book about \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner,\u201d did indeed notice the new Olympic take on the song. What struck him most was the way it handled the climactic \u201cland of the free,\u201d which is typically wrung for maximum emotion.\u201cHere it goes to a minor chord,\u201d he said, \u201cso rather than having that firm, confident expression of the word \u2018free,\u2019 you get an unstable, questioning chord. Where you should be feeling victory, you have a question mark.\u201dClague sounds less bothered by this take on the anthem. Maybe it is because he knows thousands of versions have been created over the years and he regards the tune as a variety of clay that everyone is free to mold. He also surmises that the arranger was adapting the song for the moment.\u201cWhen we play the anthem in the U.S., it\u2019s often all about creating a sense of unity in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Olympics is a very different context. We\u2019re really celebrating brotherhood, international cooperation, rather than martial qualities that anthems are often called upon to express. Three flags are being raised, not one. So I think that what has happened here is they\u2019ve softened the song, de-emphasizing the militant aspect and emphasizing the song\u2019s lyrical side, to bring out the community-of-nations idea.\u201dThe United States Olympic Committee said it was not responsible for submitting the anthem to Olympic organizers. The group that is running the Rio Games said it would look into the origin of the United States anthem being played here.This version may not be making its Olympic debut. According to DeBord and Clague, the version heard here in Rio was also used at the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, and the 2012 Summer Games in London. Those were in the key of C major and were 70 seconds long.During a medal ceremony, Shazam, the song identification app, tagged the track as \u201cThe London Philharmonic Orchestra & Philip Sheppard.\u201dIf this rendition originated in London, where did London get it?That project was led by Sheppard, a British composer, cellist and professor at the Royal Academy of Music whose website states that he has scored more than 30 films and worked with David Bowie, Jeff Buckley, the Weeknd and many other recording artists. In the video, he is seen conducting the London Philharmonic Orchestra at Abbey Road, the studio made famous by the Beatles.Sheppard could not be reached Wednesday.\u201cThe anthems serve a particular purpose at the Olympics,\u201d he tells an off-screen interviewer in the video. \u201cThat is namely to get the flag up the pole during the gold medal ceremonies.\u201dHe is making the practical point that the songs cannot go on and on. So one of his biggest challenges, he said, was ensuring that each anthem lasted 60 to 90 seconds. This meant dramatic cuts for some anthems \u2014 like Uruguay\u2019s, which usually lasts for six and a half minutes \u2014 and looping repetition for others, like Uganda\u2019s, which is only nine bars long.All the countries had to sign off on the new arrangements, Sheppard says. At one moment in the video, he sounds a little nervous about whether Britain will give a thumbs-up.The video ends, inexplicably, with the full, 70-second rendering of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d as the camera shows an American flag. There is no commentary.Is it possible that Sheppard went with minor chords as a way to shave time off the tune? The standard \u201cland of the free,\u201d for instance, when milked properly, takes its time.DeBord doubts it. But for him, the need for edits could never justify such maddening results.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to compromise a piece of music,\u201d he said, \u201cto make it work for time.\u201dTeresa Cotsirilos contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

No, we\u2019re not talking about dropping the Wall Street bull\u2019s testicles on to the floor of Congress, though that was how clever editing made it look last week. Rather, Darlene and her core crew \u2014 the nebbish Mobley, who\u2019s ready to run; the more cautious Trenton, who has her Iranian immigrant family to consider; and Darlene\u2019s ex-boyfriend Cisco, their link to the fearsome Dark Army \u2014 record and broadcast a conference call about the F.B.I.\u2019s \u201cOperation Berenstain,\u201d which is warrantlessly monitoring the communications of millions of Americans to hunt for the hack\u2019s perpetrators.\u201cBackdoor access to every smartphone,\u201d a list of cooperating companies that includes \u201cGoogle, AT&T, Uber, Apple, Verizon, Facebook\u201d: This wholesale collusion between the state and corporations to violate privacy is so grimly plausible it barely qualifies as fiction, even before footage of Edward Snowden is repurposed to comment on the scandal.Yet Darlene\u2019s rhetoric in the broadcast, alarmingly violent even by the standards of a group that uses a slasher\u2019s mask as its sigil, is an early indication that the group is feeling desperate. She refers to the government\u2019s \u201ctyrannical rape of our private data,\u201d a disturbing choice of words given fsociety\u2019s collaboration with Julian Assange\u2019s WikiLeaks and its own less than stellar track record with both rape and private data.\u201cWe will destroy you!\u201d she barks at the feds, once again adopting \u201cwar on terror\u201d verbiage \u2014 not a promising route to success. So when the E Corp lawyer Susan Jacobs, a.k.a. Madame Executioner, has her \u201csmart home\u201d unexpectedly commandeered as the group\u2019s headquarters, what befalls her has a nauseating air of inevitability to it.Not that Jacobs comes across as anything but awful during her too-brief stint as the group\u2019s hostage. She goads Trenton about her Muslim faith in an attempt to escape: \u201cIs that what this is about? ISIS or something?\u201d And proceeding to call them a bunch of animals.It does her no good, though, since the moment she slips loose she tries to attack Trenton and winds up banging her head on the wall, knocking herself out. Realizing she\u2019ll need medical care, the frightened foursome frantically search her personal accounts for information with which to blackmail her before they take her to a hospital, and discover that she\u2019s been sleeping with judges in exchange for more favorable verdicts. As their leader, Darlene volunteers to confront Jacobs with their discovery \u2014 but instead tazes her and leaves her to drown in her swimming pool, committing a murder that had been on her mind ever since she was 4 years old and saw Jacobs laughing about the case that killed her and Elliot\u2019s father.From there, things manage to get even uglier, somehow. Darlene and Cisco take Jacobs\u2019s body to the pet crematory they use to dispose of evidence, and are forced to remove her body from the suitcase they\u2019d packed it in and jam it directly into the oven. Mobley and Trenton return home, looking over their shoulders, jumping at every sound \u2014 jittery editing and sudden crash cuts heighten the sense of fear. Sure enough, Mobley is arrested by Dom DiPierro, but she has no idea how high up he is, suspecting him merely of being the D.J. at fsociety\u2019s party the night of the hack. Her superior forces her to let him go in light of the bad press that the bureau is already receiving. He signals to Trenton that they\u2019ve been burned and have to flee, but never shows up at their designated meeting place. Darlene, meanwhile, sleeps at Cisco\u2019s place, and awakens to discover that he\u2019s reporting on her to the Dark Army; the episode ends when she smashes his laptop, then hits him in the head with a baseball bat.Even the relatively tangential Angela has a terrible time of things. She has an ugly confrontation with one of her father\u2019s working-class friends; he hits her with crude sexual insults, she responds with classist cheap shots. She sings a joyless rendition of Tears for Fears\u2019 \u201cEverybody Wants to Rule the World\u201d at karaoke, then ditches her boyfriend for an older man of dubious intent played by Mark Moses (Duck Phillips of \u201cMad Men\u201d). This, perhaps, is for the best, since said boyfriend was an undercover F.B.I. agent, but even so \u2014 just ask Peggy Olson how dating Duck Phillips turned out.But in Elliot\u2019s absence, the episode\u2019s true star is the composer Mac Quayle\u2019s score. The show\u2019s usual electronic hum is complemented, and at times supplanted, by screeching strings and dissonant jolts straight out of a horror film. Which, of course, is what the episode really is: a monster movie, if only in the Nietzschean sense. Darlene has dedicated her life to fighting monsters, and now she\u2019s become one herself. Emerging from an hour of television this expertly discomfiting feels like bursting free of a haunted house.Advertisement"}

Playing off celebrated co-stars like Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig, she is able to steal even the scenes in which she has no dialogue with just a gaudy grimace or a roll of her eyes.Not that Ms. McKinnon thinks of herself this way. \u201cI pride myself on being tragically uncool,\u201d she explained in an interview on Tuesday.\u201cI\u2019m wearing cat socks right now,\u201d she said in her dry, Hepburn-esque drawl. \u201cBut I\u2019m wearing them just for the utilitarian purpose of wearing socks.\u201dOver lunch at a vegan restaurant in Manhattan, she spoke about her \u201cGhostbusters\u201d experience and the distinctions she draws between her characters and herself. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.You made such specific choices in your portrayal of Holtzmann. How did you approach the role?I just wanted to make a character who was very alien but so joyful and earnest and fascinated by the world that you would relate to her anyway. In the script, there were these moments where she would be talking so lackadaisically about an extraordinarily lethal piece of equipment. I thought, what sort of a person could let that terror slide off her shoulders? But I noticed that I underreact in a similar way, in a lot of situations.How so?In most combat scenarios, I find that I\u2019m pretty steady. [laughs] No, seriously. \u201cS.N.L.\u201d can be a stressful environment, and I am panicking constantly, but I guess I keep it pretty internal. Because I\u2019ve been told that I seem calm-ish.Did you consult with any real-life scientists?I\u2019ve been a big astrophysics nut since I was 12. I have always had a real soft spot for the bizarreness of quantum mechanics. But I gave up on being a scientist in high school \u2014 I\u2019m just not that good at math. So that ticks me off, that I\u2019ve limited myself and my life choices in that way. I will never be a theoretical physicist.Who devised her wardrobe and hairstyle? No. I\u2019m so sorry.Do you think it\u2019s significant that moviegoers who don\u2019t see themselves represented onscreen are identifying with her?I wanted Holtzmann to be a general champion for the disenfranchised and the other. And I hope that she appeals to anyone who feels like that.She did text, and she was deeply, deeply disturbed and upset. As anyone would be. I said that I love her and she\u2019s gorgeous. And she should get off Twitter. [chuckles] But that\u2019s not a solution. \u201cJust don\u2019t read it\u201d is not a solution.You don\u2019t have a social media presence \u2014 I imagine that didn\u2019t change your mind?Even when Facebook came out and I was in college, I found myself never putting anything on it. It just feels unnatural to me to broadcast anything other than the character I\u2019ve created.You\u2019re very modest in person, yet you play many over-the-top characters. Where do they come from, I wonder?You and my therapist. [laughs] There must be some exhibitionist tendency that I funnel into these other people. I think it comes from wanting to share and to connect, to offer up for display something that I find delightful and fascinating. I hope that if other people feel the same way then we\u2019ve made a connection. That\u2019s the way I feel most comfortable connecting.Are you paying close attention to the presidential election to gather more material on Hillary Clinton?I\u2019m following it because we\u2019re at a real moment right now. But also because I feel very connected to her, in a strange way. I spend so many hours studying her and imagining her inner life that I feel like we\u2019re very close. Even though I don\u2019t have her phone number.She was very warm and charming and sincere. And I liked being around her, and I felt a similarity to her, in that I am a very accomplished legal scholar and have spent my life crusading for the middle class.Have you ever met Justice Ginsburg? Are you already thinking about \u201cS.N.L.\u201d starting up in the fall?Will you go back to \u201cS.N.L.\u201d with more visibility because of all the praise you\u2019ve received this summer?That would be hellish. What makes this current cast so strong is that there\u2019s fairly equitable distribution of real estate within the show, and everyone has such a different voice and really gets to use that. It feels like a real ensemble. Before getting hired there, I did mostly one-woman shows, and I liked being the only weird one onstage. But that gets old real fast, not just for me but for people watching.Has there been any talk of a \u201cGhostbusters\u201d sequel?I haven\u2019t heard. I haven\u2019t been doing that much. I literally don\u2019t know what I did the last two weeks. I know that I had a consultation about window dressings with a lady who was very knowledgeable. That took up a big part of my psychic energy.What would be your dream role to play?My manager asks me this every day, and I don\u2019t quite have the answer. What I want is to play as many as possible. I really like collections of things. I love antique botanical prints with a bunch of different weeds and seeds. I love the produce section at the grocery store. A panoply of gorgeous, fascinating distinct objects with a common theme, is what I would love to build for the rest of my career, as long as they\u2019ll have me.A picture caption on Thursday with an article about the comic actress Kate McKinnon, using information from the Wu Liang Ye restaurant in Manhattan, where Ms. McKinnon was shown, misstated the name of the executive chef there.

{"Headline": "Pinterest Follows Rivals Into Selling Video Ads", "Date": "2016-08-17", "News": "Supported byPinterest is finally taking the plunge that many other tech companies already have: It has started selling video advertising.Video ads from brands like Kate Spade and bareMinerals will start appearing in the virtual scrapbook-like Pinterest feed on Wednesday and into the coming weeks, and Pinterest is hopeful that ads from other brands will soon follow.The new ads will show up in a silent, GIF-like format within Pinterest\u2019s feed, and will play with sound once clicked. Users will be able to click images, or pins, of featured products next to the videos. That could, for instance, bring them to a brand\u2019s website or allow them to buy the product without leaving Pinterest.The move puts the social-bookmarking site in competition with the likes of Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat, as well as large digital publishers, which are all vying for the increasingly large amounts of marketers\u2019 digital ad dollars.Last year, Etsy was the website with the greatest number of links from Pinterest\u2019s Save button. Now, it is YouTube.\u201cCandidly, the company just in general has underinvested until now in video as a platform,\u201d Jon Kaplan, the head of global sales at Pinterest, said in an interview. \u201cWe wanted to make sure it was customized and specific to the way people use our platform. What you\u2019re going to see going forward is a very big investment in video.\u201dPinterest will most likely benefit from some brands that are turning away from TV, he said.BareMinerals, a makeup brand, will promote a new foundation on Pinterest with a video tutorial. Because the product is geared toward millennials, the brand decided to spend less on TV for the campaign, said Rebecca Boston, global director of social marketing for bareMinerals.\u201cTalking to advertisers, there\u2019s an insatiable demand for video inventory,\u201d Mr. Kaplan of Pinterest said. \u201cThe viewership of TV is something that\u2019s of concern to them. That viewership is going down, ratings are going down, and they need to find places to accomplish their business objectives where people are spending their actual time.\u201dMs. Boston added: \u201cWhile it does have TV, we are investing more of a percentage of our marketing budget in digital and mobile because that\u2019s where the millennial is spending her time. She\u2019s not watching as much TV as she used to.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Swiping a Screen Rather Than Flip a Page in Baseball", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf a major league coach or player is scrolling through an iPad in the dugout, he is probably not perusing Facebook but rather accessing his scouting reports.Through a partnership with Apple, each team in Major League Baseball has been given eight iPads to use in the dugout and bullpen during games. They are loaded with M.L.B. Dugout, an app that displays scouting reports and other information as well as videos of their opponents.\u201cI think we wanted to kind of make sure that we were able to continue to support and allow our clubs to stay on the cutting edge in terms of technology, and analytics and using statistics to help the sport be a better sport,\u201d said Chris Marinak, M.L.B.\u2019s senior vice president for league economics and strategy.For the most part, the iPads offer information that teams already use, but in a way that is faster and easier to access.The San Francisco Giants have embraced the iPads, and the Giants\u2019 bench coach, Ron Wotus, said that he had eliminated the binders he previously used.\u201cWe\u2019ve always had it in books,\u201d Wotus said. \u201cI\u2019d have to carry two big binders, and you have to flip through papers. So it\u2019s much more efficient.\u201dWotus said he checked the iPad more often during the first games of series against teams outside the Giants\u2019 division.\u201cYou can prepare all day, and you get in the game, we don\u2019t know these clubs as well,\u201d Wotus said. \u201cThere\u2019s always something else that you can look at. So it\u2019s available if I want it, but I would say I\u2019m looking at that more than I was the binders.\u201dTeams were able to test the program at the end of last season. Then, after some enhancements to the app, it became standard at the start of this season. An updated version was released after the All-Star break, allowing coaches to make handwritten notes and look at files side by side.The iPads are different from the ones consumers use. Dugout is the only app clubs can access. Even the camera is disabled.Sean True, the senior director for club services and baseball technology at the commissioner\u2019s office, said the clubs\u2019 top concern was data protection and security.Support staff members load the information that the Giants\u2019 coaches want. For Wotus, that includes scouting reports and spray charts, because he also manages the infield defense. He also uses the video of an opposing player.\u201cYou can look at plots on paper, like a spray chart, and that doesn\u2019t tell you the story,\u201d Wotus said.The Giants\u2019 hitting coach, Hensley Meulens, has players study opposing pitchers in the video room on the first day of a series. But then, when a reliever comes into the game, he will pull up his report on an iPad to provide a refresher.He also keeps a simple sheet of paper on a clipboard with information on the opposing team\u2019s pitchers. A few Giants players look at the paper, but most use an iPad, Meulens said.\u201cIt\u2019s a lot quicker to get to the player you want to get to, because you just click on him and it opens up,\u201d Meulens said. \u201cOtherwise, you have to try to find the guy as time is running.\u201dFor Mets Manager Terry Collins, turning a page is still quicker, although he also said the iPads were useful.\u201cI know people that are a lot more familiar using them are glad they\u2019re in there,\u201d he said.Meulens said he still kept a binder for backup in case of an iPad malfunction. And when several players are trying to look up information at the same time, it can be helpful to have three options: the iPad, the binder and the cheat sheet on the clipboard.The St. Louis Cardinals are one club that has not quite fully adopted the iPads. Cardinals reliever Matt Bowman said much of the team\u2019s bullpen information was relayed orally. And if he has a question, he will refer back to the bullpen coach, Blaise Ilsley.\u201cSo he\u2019s sort of our iPad in that sense,\u201d Bowman said.Baltimore Orioles Manager Buck Showalter said he would check an iPad in the dugout occasionally, sometimes when a new pitcher entered the game. But perhaps memory, at least Showalter\u2019s, is one thing the iPads can\u2019t trump.\u201cIf you\u2019re referring to that a lot when you\u2019re out here, you haven\u2019t done your homework,\u201d Showalter said. \u201cI usually have it, believe it or not, stored upstairs.\u201d James Wagner contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "University of Chicago Strikes Back Against Campus Political Correctness", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe anodyne welcome letter to incoming freshmen is a college staple, but this week the University of Chicago took a different approach: It sent new students a blunt statement opposing some hallmarks of campus political correctness, drawing thousands of impassioned responses, for and against, as it caromed around cyberspace.\u201cOur commitment to academic freedom means that we do not support so-called trigger warnings, we do not cancel invited speakers because their topics might prove controversial, and we do not condone the creation of intellectual \u2018safe spaces\u2019 where individuals can retreat from ideas and perspectives at odds with their own,\u201d John Ellison, dean of students, wrote to members of the class of 2020, who will arrive next month.The Chicago letter echoed policies that were already in place there and at a number of other universities calling for \u201cthe freedom to espouse and explore a wide range of ideas.\u201d But its stark wording, coming from one of the nation\u2019s leading universities, and in a routine correspondence that usually contains nothing more contentious than a dining hall schedule, felt to people on all sides like a statement.Other universities have made similar statements, but the message from Chicago is \u201cclearer and more direct than I\u2019ve seen,\u201d said Greg Lukianoff, president of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a leading critic of what it says are destructive speech restrictions at many campuses. \u201cSending a letter to freshmen is different than I\u2019ve seen, at least in a long time, and certainly from a major university.\u201dMichael S. Roth, president of Wesleyan University, said the Chicago letter was, at least in part, a publicity stunt \u2014 \u201cGosh, is there any doubt?\u201d he asked \u2014 and a way of \u201cnot coddling students, but coddling donors.\u201dJeremy Manier, a University of Chicago spokesman, insisted there were no hidden motives behind the letter. And he said professors remained free, at their discretion, to use trigger warnings, the messages sometimes posted atop campus publications, assignments and other material, noting that they might be upsetting for people who have had traumatic experiences.But while conservatives often frame campus free speech as a left-versus-right issue, the dispute is often within the left.\u201cHistorically, the left has been much more protective of academic freedom than the right, particularly in the university context,\u201d said Geoffrey R. Stone, a University of Chicago law professor who specializes in free speech issues. Conservatives \u201csuddenly became the champions of free speech, which I find is a bit ironic, but the left is divided.\u201dMr. Lukianoff said he and his group are often mistakenly called conservative, adding, \u201cI\u2019m a former A.C.L.U. person who worked in refugee camps.\u201dThe dispute over free speech has ricocheted off campuses and around the country. In a commencement speech this year at Howard University, President Obama said: \u201cDon\u2019t try to shut folks out, don\u2019t try to shut them down, no matter how much you might disagree with them. There\u2019s been a trend around the country of trying to get colleges to disinvite speakers with a different point of view, or disrupt a politician\u2019s rally. Don\u2019t do that \u2014 no matter how ridiculous or offensive you might find the things that come out of their mouths.\u201dMr. Obama taught constitutional law at the university law school.The university said Friday that Dean Ellision and the university president, Robert R. Zimmer, were not available to discuss the letter or what prompted it, but Mr. Manier referred queries to Professor Stone, a former university provost.\u201cWe didn\u2019t feel we were doing something, internal to the University of Chicago, that was in any way radical or different,\u201d Professor Stone said Friday. It is clear that some colleges are retreating from the same free speech values, he said, \u201cbut my guess, if you asked most of these institutions 10 or 20 years ago, they would have said more or less what we said in our statement.\u201dSince Professor Stone\u2019s committee produced its report, several other universities, including Princeton, Purdue, Columbia and the University of Wisconsin system, have adopted similar policies or statements, some of them taken almost verbatim from the report. And this week\u2019s letter to University of Chicago freshmen draws from that and specifically cites the report as embodying the university\u2019s point of view.Many academics say the concerns reflected in the University of Chicago letter, while real, are overblown. \u201cI asked faculty if any had ever been asked to give trigger warnings,\u201d said Dr. Roth, of Wesleyan. \u201cI think one person said they had.\u201dBut when asked specifically about \u201cslurs and other language on campus that is intentionally offensive to certain groups,\u201d 69 percent of college students said that colleges should be allowed to impose restrictions on such expression.Eric Holmberg, the student body president at the University of Chicago, said the letter suggested that administrators \u201cdon\u2019t understand what a trigger warning is,\u201d and seemed \u201cbased on this false narrative of coddled millennials.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an effort to frame any sort of activism on campus as anti-free-speech, just young people who are upset,\u201d Mr. Holmberg said, \u201cwhen in reality I\u2019d say the administration is far more fearful of challenge than any student I know.\u201dChristopher Mele and Megan Thee-Brenan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Tower Climber Snatched by Police as the Internet Watches", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "Supported byA lone man\u2019s climb up the side of Trump Tower became a New York City spectacle on Wednesday afternoon after thousands watched his ascent in real time on television, through social media and in person.The man was pulled off the building\u2019s facade and apprehended by police officers who had removed a glass panel on the 21st floor about three hours into his climb. By then, he had become a social media sensation, as people watched live videos posted on Facebook and Periscope, a live video-streaming app. A stream on Facebook from WABC-TV in New York received more than four million views, and people commented along with the action. Clad in shorts and a T-shirt, the climber began to scale the building around 3:30 p.m., the police said, wearing a harness and using what appeared to be suction cups to aid his climb.Police did not release the name of the man, whom they took to Bellevue Hospital Center for an evaluation.On Wednesday night, Mr. Trump expressed his appreciation for the police on Twitter, writing, \u201cGreat job today by the NYPD in protecting the people and saving the climber.\u201dWith the climber\u2019s image being broadcast \u2014 and commented on \u2014 far and wide on Wednesday, the man perched, if only briefly, at the intersection of two unpredictable worlds: the combustible presidential campaign and the chaotic city beneath him.It has been a magnet for those making political statements: a protester in a Ku Klux Klan-style hood who tussled with security guards in September; 200 marchers in December; anti-gun activists in the spring. It has also been the site of a zoning tussle, magnified by the stakes of the presidential election, after the Trump Organization was forced to remove a Trump kiosk from its lobby, which had been designated as a public space as part of an agreement that allowed the developer to add 20 stories to the building\u2019s height.And it has burnished its status as a tourist attraction, drawing more than one million visitors every year from around the globe.On Wednesday, hundreds of people gawked from the streets below, filming the climb with cameras and phones, oohing after the man dropped an object. Some cheered for him, remarking on the difficulty of his climb. \u201cYou will never believe what I just saw,\u201d a woman leaving the commotion said into her cellphone.Aaron Hesseltine, 17, in town with his family from Saranac Lake, N.Y., to see Alex Rodriguez\u2019s last game with the Yankees, watched for an hour and a half, documenting the experience on Snapchat for his friends at home.

{"Headline": "For Wedding Photography, Some Couples Eschew a Pro in Favor of GoPro", "Date": "2016-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGuests at weddings this summer may no longer be surprised by the couple\u2019s casual manner of dress, or by the circle of food trucks in place of formally catered seated dinners, or even by the fact that an old high school pal of the groom has been ordained online and enlisted as the officiant.It is the lack of another expected element \u2014 a professional wedding photographer, multiple cameras swinging from his or her neck \u2014 that may surprise some attendees.Surprising, because those same guests are now being asked to put down their drinks and start clicking away with their cellphone cameras.In a move to save money and contribute to the \u201cwinging it\u201d feel, a handful of couples are relying on relatives and friends \u2014 their pockets and purses jammed with GoPro cameras, cellphones and mini iPads \u2014 to capture the bride taking that nervous breath before she walks down the aisle or the groom hugging his father, tears in their eyes.\u201cTwo years ago, this was a conversation you never would have had,\u201d said David Tutera, a celebrity wedding planner and the host of the TV show \u201cDavid Tutera\u2019s Celebrations.\u201dFew are likely to miss the photo assistants holding large reflectors and shouting, \u201cLook here!\u201d But the more casual approach to capturing important wedding moments has had mixed results.\u201cEveryone we know has an iPhone, and most take beautiful pictures on Instagram, so we knew they\u2019d be fine,\u201d said Samantha Resnik, 33, whose wedding to Mark Edmunds, 43, included a large reception on May 21 at the West End Hall, on upper Broadway. A single photographer, she said, cannot be everywhere at once. \u201cHe can\u2019t possibly capture what 175 guests can,\u201d Ms. Resnik said.In addition to asking guests to use hashtags on Facebook or Instagram to post photos, couples are now relying solely on them to tell a visual story. \u201cWe wanted friends and family to share the moments we ourselves were not present for,\u201d Ms. Resnik said.Jessica Lawrence, 31, and Scott Maldonado, 40, were on a tight budget for their July 30 ceremony at the Maldonado family\u2019s home in New Hampshire. So they asked their friend Nas Siqueira to capture their day.\u201cWe know Nas and trust her,\u201d said the bride, now Mrs. Maldonado. \u201cWe wanted candid shots, not cheesy ones that seemed posed or inauthentic.\u201dNot everyone thinks relying on friends to record the big day is a good idea. \u201cAn expert knows what to look for,\u201d Mr. Tutera said, a perspective echoed by Jono Waks, the owner of an event planning business in Manhattan bearing his name.\u201cAside from the fact that someone\u2019s head will be cut off or someone might be cropped out accidentally, you want a dedicated professional there to ensure you get all of the memories and photos you want,\u201d Mr. Waks said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a lot of pressure to ask guests to take pictures.\u201dTo woo couples who may be thinking of forgoing a professional, some who make their living photographing weddings are offering packages that no friend can match: images from the engagement party and rehearsal dinner, DVDs, bound albums and photo thank-you cards.During big wedding moments, even professional photographers find that cellphone-snapping guests who thrust their devices into the air are impossible to avoid. \u201cThe reality is you\u2019re going to have as many phones as there are pews,\u201d said Brian Dorsey, a wedding photographer whose packages start at $7,400 and can go as high as $50,000. \u201cYou can crop out as much as possible, but their presence is a statement of where we are today. It defines the time.\u201dMr. Dorsey also admitted that some guests may capture a moment better than expected. \u201cThough smartphones haven\u2019t impacted the hiring of photographers, because people see the difference in hiring a professional as opposed to a guest, many more people are taking photos, and they are taking good ones,\u201d he said.At the Resnik-Edmunds reception, Mike Schoenfeld, a college friend, took the prize shot. \u201cMark and I stepped outside for a moment to take a breath,\u201d Ms. Resnik said. \u201cIt was raining and we were standing under the awning and he snapped this really beautiful picture of us, which I\u2019m not sure a photographer would have taken or caught.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: In \u2018Hillbilly Elegy,\u2019 a Tough Love Analysis of the Poor Who Back Trump", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "Supported byBooks of The TimesAfter reading \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d you can easily understand why. This is a historically peculiar election cycle, boisterously disrupted by outsiders, one of whom found the perfect host body in the Republican Party and became its presidential nominee. An investigation of voter estrangement has never felt more urgent, and we\u2019re certainly not getting one from the lacquered chatterers on the boob tube.Now, along comes Mr. Vance, offering a compassionate, discerning sociological analysis of the white underclass that has helped drive the politics of rebellion, particularly the ascent of Donald J. Trump. Combining thoughtful inquiry with firsthand experience, Mr. Vance has inadvertently provided a civilized reference guide for an uncivilized election, and he\u2019s done so in a vocabulary intelligible to both Democrats and Republicans.Imagine that.On the checklist of modern privilege, Mr. Vance, 31, has the top four in the bag: He is white, male, straight and Protestant.But his profile is misleading. His people \u2014 hillbillies, rednecks, white trash, choose your epithet (or term of affection, depending on your point of view) \u2014 didn\u2019t step off the Mayflower and become part of America\u2019s ascendant class. \u201cPoverty is the family tradition,\u201d he writes. His ancestors and kin were sharecroppers, coal miners, machinists, millworkers \u2014 all low-paying, body-wearying occupations that over the years have vanished or offered diminished security.Mr. Vance was raised in Middletown, Ohio, a now-decaying steel town filled with Kentucky transplants, which at one point included his Mamaw and Papaw \u2014 in newscaster English, that\u2019s grandma and grandpa \u2014 who moved there shortly after World War II. Though the couple eventually managed to achieve the material comforts of a middle-class life (house, car), they brought their Appalachian values and habits with them. Some were wonderfully positive, like loyalty and love of country. But others, like a tendency toward violence and verbal abuse, were inimical to family life.Papaw was forever coming home drunk. Mamaw, \u201ca violent nondrunk,\u201d was forever tormenting him, whether by serving him artfully arranged plates of garbage for dinner or dousing him with gasoline. All this guerrilla warfare affected their children. Mr. Vance\u2019s mother was an empress of instability \u2014 violent, feckless, prone to hysteria. A long stint in rehab couldn\u2019t shake her addiction to prescription narcotics (she\u2019d later move on to heroin). She spun through more boyfriends than this reader could count and at least five husbands.The only reason Mr. Vance made it out in one piece is because his grandparents eventually reconciled, becoming his unofficial guardians. (He also spent a terrifically affirming four years in the Marines.) Mamaw was especially encouraging. She was tough as snakeskin, foul-mouthed as a mobster and filled with love. In a town where many children don\u2019t finish high school, she raised a grandson who managed to graduate from Ohio State University and Yale Law School, defying skyscraping odds.\u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d in my mind, divides into two components: the family stories Mr. Vance tells \u2014 most of which are no doubt better experienced on the page than they were in real life \u2014 and the questions he raises. Chief among them: How much should he hold his hillbilly kin responsible for their own misfortunes?In Mr. Vance\u2019s estimation, the answer is: a lot. Economic insecurity, he\u2019s convinced, accounts for only a small part of his community\u2019s problems; the much larger issue is hillbilly culture itself. Though proud of it in many ways, he\u2019s also convinced that it \u201cincreasingly encourages social decay instead of counteracting it.\u201dHis frustration with the nonworking white poor is especially acute. He recalls being a cashier at a Middletown grocery store and watching resentfully as his neighbors, who had creatively gamed the welfare system, jabbered on their cellphones as they were going through the checkout line.He could not afford a cellphone.\u201cPolitical scientists have spent millions of words trying to explain how Appalachia and the South went from staunchly Democratic to staunchly Republican in less than a generation,\u201d Mr. Vance writes. He suspects those cellphones have a lot to do with it. \u201cI could never understand why our lives felt like a struggle while those living off of government largess enjoyed trinkets that I only dreamed about.\u201dTime and again, Mr. Vance preaches a message of tough love and personal responsibility. He has no patience with an old acquaintance who told him he quit his job because he hated waking up early, only to take to Facebook to blame the \u201cObama economy.\u201d Or with a former co-worker at a tile warehouse who missed work once a week though his girlfriend was pregnant.The difference is that President Obama believes poverty, though it may have a cultural component, is largely a structural problem, one the government can play a large role in fixing. Mr. Vance, a conservative, takes a far dimmer view.Whether you agree with Mr. Vance or not, you must admire him for his head-on confrontation with a taboo subject. And he frames his critique generously, stipulating that it isn\u2019t laziness that\u2019s destroying hillbilly culture but what the psychologist Martin Seligman calls \u201clearned helplessness\u201d \u2014 the fatalistic belief, born of too much adversity, that nothing can be done to change your lot.What he\u2019s really writing about is despair.Never is Mr. Vance more aware of this pessimism and estrangement than when he leaves for Ohio State University. He\u2019s plumped with hope; his neighbors, left behind, feel its opposite. \u201cThere was something almost spiritual,\u201d he writes, \u201cabout the cynicism of the community at large.\u201dHis friends and relations are convinced that the media lies. That politicians lie. That the military, an institution they revere, is fighting two fruitless wars. Universities feel \u201crigged\u201d and inaccessible; job prospects are slim. For what purpose do you live under such circumstances? When the stanchions of your life have sunk into the muck?Mr. Vance doesn\u2019t have all the answers. But he\u2019s advancing the conversation.Hillbilly ElegyA Memoir of a Family and Culture in CrisisBy J. D. Vance264 pages. Harper. $27.99.Advertisement"}

A plastic surgeon didn\u2019t create the bone spurs, and the need for Wharton-trained American businessmen will likely never decline, during, after or before our foreign conflicts.He wasn\u2019t profiteering during the conflict \u2014 he was taking risks and creating jobs.A professional runner\u2019s sponsor is 99 percent of their income, as opposed to many other professional sports players that receive a team salary in addition to the money made through sponsorship and ensuing promotions of that brand.The brand that a professional track athlete wears is their backbone, their financial support, and many of these athletes are extremely grateful toward these companies for providing them with financial support as they compete in a sport with little prize money out there.The wearing of a brand is a give back from these athletes, who take pride in their sponsors, as a way to showcase these companies on such a major platform.I watched a top-ranked swimmer slip on the start and dive straight down into a 4-foot deep competition pool and hit his head so hard he was immediately knocked out and had a dislocated shoulder.Something as simple as compressing your knuckles as you drive your hand into the touch pad may require attention. Always need to expect the unexpected.Yes, these students may be a bit more radical than most \u2014 how many activists have you met who were not, in some way, radical? Yes, some of the nuance of the issues may also escape some of these students. But the cure for that is more speech, not less.Calling someone an anti-Semite, like calling someone a racist, shuts down debate and does not allow people with opposing views to better understand each other. Yet this article sets out to show the \u201cbad\u201d anti-Israel protesters (the ones who are loud, rude, and unapologetic) with the \u201cgood\u201d ones (the ones who politely discuss their differences). The fact is, some things are worth being loud about.I\u2019m liberal and a woman, but this trend to strip all history from our higher-learning institutions bugs the heck out of me. I\u2019m surprised they haven\u2019t removed the colorful Maryland state flag from campus since it\u2019s the heraldry of two slave-owning families that founded what became Maryland.The out-of-court sexism in the hallway etc. was much more obvious. One male state court judge would wink at me in court and asked me into his chambers to ask about my love life. Some of the state judges wouldn\u2019t let women wear pants in the courtroom.At my first couple of legal jobs at a firm and a district attorney\u2019s office, there was also a no-pants rule. I assume the men couldn\u2019t wear dresses to court, but they probably can now.The fact that young people are preferring this to suburbs I also find very encouraging. Surely there are some negatives, such as the \u201cdollar incentives\u201d required in Delaware, but overall I think this is a very positive trend.Our summer is short but used to the fullest. It\u2019s wonderful to see, but there are shortcomings: the noise, the litter, the lack of privacy. But it's fun and communal, so let\u2019s cheer this development. Everywhere. And let\u2019s invite the tourists with a warm heart.Retrogradation is referred to as \u201cstaling\u201d in the baking industry. The retrogradation of wheat starch in bread is responsible for staling.Consequently, if you want to maximize the useful life and quality of bread, don\u2019t store it in the refrigerator; put it in the freezer.I\u2019ve been storing fresh bread in the freezer ever since, and I\u2019ve never been disappointed.Advertisement"}

But thanks to in-class use of social media, the class also became a creative ferment of improvised dance, trust experiments and inquiries into the modern nature of the self and the crowd.The constant experimentation changed Mr. Goldsmith into a self-described \u201cradical optimist\u201d about the internet, too. While many of his peers worry about the effects that endless tweets and bad videos have on our minds and souls, he sees a positive new culture being built. The first poet laureate of the Museum of Modern Art, appointed in 2013, he believes we are headed into a creative renaissance, one with unprecedented speed and inclusion.Meanwhile, the class has evolved into a seminar on collective \u201ctime wasting\u201d that Mr. Goldsmith has held in several countries, and it returns to Penn this fall. His new book, named after the course, will be available this month.Why write this book?I had cognitive dissonance. Theorists say the internet is making us dumber, but something magical happened when my students wasted time together. They became more creative with each other. They say we\u2019re less social; I think people on the web are being social all the time. They say we\u2019re not reading; I think we\u2019re reading all the time, just online.I\u2019m an artist, and artists feel things, we distrust these studies. As a poet I wanted to observe, I wanted to feel things.You compare online experiences with 20th-century philosophies and artistic movements.The DNA of the web is embedded in 20th-century movements like Surrealism, where artists sought to live in a state like dreaming, or Pop Art, where they leveraged popular culture to make bigger points about society. Postmodernism is about sampling things and remixing them, and that is made real in this digital world.When I teach my students about the historical preconditions for what they are doing when they waste time together \u2014 things like Surrealism or Cubism \u2014 the theoretical framework helps them know that the web isn\u2019t a break, it\u2019s a continuity with earlier great thinking.But if we\u2019re just remixing, are we creating?When a D.J. brings a laptop full of music samples to a club he doesn\u2019t play an instrument, but we don\u2019t argue that he isn\u2019t doing something creative in mixing those sounds to create his own effect. In the online world the only thing you\u2019re the master of is your collection, your archive, and how you use it, how you remix it. We become digital archivists, collecting and cataloging things. I find it exciting.What will an educated person be in the future?We still read great books, and there is a place for great universities. But an educated person in the future will be a curious person who collects better artifacts. The ability to call up and use facts is the new education. How to tap them, how to use them. If we change as a culture, do we change ourselves?I\u2019ve got a 10-year-old and 17-year-old. They\u2019re thinking differently from me. They stay connected all the time, and they\u2019re smart, they play baseball, they read, they spend time online. They\u2019re not robots. Basic human qualities haven\u2019t changed.

{"Headline": "For Migrants, an Olympic Village in Ruins", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorOn the old playing fields, the migrants get a few square feet of sleeping space to share among extended families. By day, gangs of children and teenagers chase one another through the stadiums\u2019 corridors and down the steps. Listless men wander from one arena to another across cracked concrete in vast and empty parking lots. It seems a scene from a post-nuclear disaster.The No. 1 complaint? Boredom.The derelict stadiums are part of the Elliniko Camp \u2014 a complex supervised by the Greek government with help from several humanitarian organizations. In addition to about 2,000 migrants living in the athletic venues, there are at least 1,000 migrants in an abandoned international airport nearby. There, signs still list flight times for Berlin, Paris and other first-class European destinations \u2014 one more cruel joke for the new residents.A teenage student of mine, Fatemeh, whose best friend in the camp recently left with a smuggler to try her luck at the border, pointed me to her favorite work. It was a close-up in charcoal of a man staring forlornly through a chain-link fence that he grasps tightly with both hands. She was drawn to the sadness in his expression: the sadness of being left behind.When I ask, the migrants almost invariably say they want to go to Germany. Why?

Have you done that?\u201d he asked, clearly jazzed about it.I had not.\u201cOh, my gosh! I can just see the ramifications of it in schools. Kids could go visit Moscow \u2014 I mean literally walk the streets of Moscow. They can fly an airplane. They can climb Mount Everest!\u201d he said.Mr. Johnson is an amalgam of heterodox positions: anti-tax, antiwar, pro-immigration, pro-free trade and, most of all, pro-marijuana legalization. He\u2019s hoping to lure in some anti-Trump Republicans, and maybe even some disaffected Bernie Sanders supporters.Mitt Romney, the Republican Party\u2019s 2012 presidential nominee, has even said he is considering voting for the Libertarian ticket.\u201cIn the summer before an election, that\u2019s generally when a third-party candidate will look their best,\u201d said Seth Masket, a political scientist at the University of Denver. \u201cFall campaigns tend to remind Republicans what they hate about Democrats, and Democrats what they hate about Republicans.\u201d\u201cVoters who were of age during the 2000 controversy were severely enough traumatized to shy away from voting for third-party candidates,\u201d said Daniel Franklin, a political scientist at Georgia State University. \u201cBut for younger voters in particular, third-party candidates present a legitimate option. Nevertheless, third-party candidates have no chance of winning the election.\u201dAnd so Mr. Johnson will continue his quixotic quest for the White House, seeking to shake up the system from the top down. But if third parties want to hold real power in American politics, they might consider mimicking another independent party that first met at a schoolhouse in Ripon, Wis., in 1854 and, in part because it captured the national mood at the right moment, eventually unseated one of the country\u2019s major parties. That, of course, was a small band of antislavery campaigners who called themselves Republicans.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Bolster KLM\u2019s Identity, a \u2018Charmingly Clueless Approach\u2019 to Humor", "Date": "2016-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvertisingQUICK, IS KLM a brand of milk, the call letters for a radio station or a 97-year-old Dutch airline?Frequent fliers probably know the correct answer, but market research shows that many Americans often think KLM means either milk or music.So the airline, which is formally known as Royal Dutch Airlines, is embarking on an advertising campaign that is heavy on self-deprecating humor to explain what the letters mean.\u201cThe brand has not been so visible, but we want people to know it\u2019s an airline, and that it\u2019s Dutch,\u201d said Christophe Attard, the vice president of marketing for Air France-KLM. The carrier, whose name in Dutch is Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij, merged with Air France in 2004, but the branding for the two airlines is separate.\u201cWe wanted KLM to reflect the nationality of the country,\u201d Mr. Attard said. \u201cIt\u2019s friendly and innovative.\u201dAnd the humor is self-effacing. Ken Marino, an American actor who starred in the NBC sitcom \u201cMarry Me,\u201d wryly comments on questions such as \u201cWhat is an airline?\u201d and \u201cWhat is a flight attendant?\u201d He delivers his remarks with an exaggerated sincerity intended to provoke a smile or a chuckle from social media viewers, who are the target audience of the video.The humor makes a product or service more approachable, said John Limotte, chief executive of Mustache, a video production company based in Brooklyn that worked with KLM on the campaign.\u201cIt\u2019s not a self-flattering or broadly comedic humor, but more of a charmingly clueless approach where stating the obvious is likable,\u201d he said.The approach underscores KLM\u2019s effort to solidify its American market, where it currently has eight gateways for passengers to fly directly to Amsterdam. The Dutch carrier is striving to keep its footing against competition from low-cost rivals, as well as carriers based in the Middle East that are trying to expand their service networks. And, like other airlines, KLM must contend with the impact of terrorist attacks on its leisure travel business.KLM said trans-Atlantic traffic is 15 percent of its long-haul business, and it has experienced a 7 percent increase in traffic between the United States and Europe since 2014.\u201cThe United States, for decades and in the future, serves as the backbone of our worldwide operations outside of Europe,\u201d said Pieter Elbers, KLM\u2019s president and chief executive. \u201cIt is an incredibly important market to the company.\u201dLast year, KLM expanded its business between Amsterdam, Atlanta and Los Angeles, and began direct service between Salt Lake City and Amsterdam this year. In November, the carrier plans to introduce direct service between Amsterdam and Miami.The airline must first ensure that American travelers know what it is. The company commissioned a consumer awareness survey two years ago to gauge familiarity with its brand. The survey, conducted by phone and in person at airports, found that potential customers did not have a clear idea that KLM was an airline, Mr. Attard said.One reason could be that KLM and Air France partner with Delta Air Lines on trans-Atlantic flights, so tickets show Delta\u2019s name first. The Dutch carrier\u2019s name was little seen in the United States for years because of a joint venture from 1997 to 2009 with Northwest Airlines, which handled sales in North America. That ended after Northwest\u2019s merger with Delta.Currently, KLM and Air France \u2014 members of the SkyTeam global airline alliance \u2014 offer a points program called Flying Blue but market their brands individually. To distinguish KLM\u2019s separate identity, the carrier decided to refresh its brand: It retained its blue letters on a white background and longstanding logo, a crown, but enlarged it.Mustache developed four brand identity videos with the low-key, droll humor KLM was seeking. The creative agency drew attention to its understated humor with its award-winning 2014 travel video series on the Netherlands, called \u201cHolland. The Original Cool.\u201d The first video in the series received more than a million views on YouTube.Humor in advertising is appealing \u201cbecause the entertainment aspect is the hook to get people to watch,\u201d said Michael Lewis, an associate professor of marketing at Emory University\u2019s Goizueta Business School.\u201cIt gives legitimacy to a brand that\u2019s less familiar,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is more important for KLM than for carriers like Air France or British Airways, which have the country in their name.\u201dMr. Lewis added: \u201cBut while differentiating brands has been a holy grail for airlines, more consumers are viewing the airline trip as a commodity product. It\u2019s the ability to go to point A, then to point B, except, perhaps, for frequent fliers who still want to have access to upgrades and airport lounges.\u201dMr. Attard, however, said market research showed a perceptional difference between KLM and Air France, which he said was viewed as snobbish and expensive. KLM wanted to underscore its innovation, which the airline had demonstrated through a partnership with Facebook that enabled booking flights via the Messenger app, he said.KLM\u2019s new campaign will appear on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, as well as on a site, ItsAnAirline.com. It will feature interactive elements, including letting visitors earn loyalty points by finding hidden objects.Because of an editing error, an article on Monday about an advertising campaign for KLM, the Dutch airline, referred incorrectly to its official name. The airline is formally known as Royal Dutch Airlines, not \u201cformerly\u201d known as such.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazil\u2019s Uplifting Olympics", "Date": "2016-08-15", "News": "Supported byWhen I was a correspondent in Brazil 30 years ago, inflation was rampant. It ran at an average of 707.4 percent a year from 1985 to 1989. The salaries of the poor were wiped out within hours of being paid. The country went through three currencies \u2014 cruzeiro, cruzado and cruzado novo \u2014 while I lived in Rio. The only way out for Brazilians, people joked, was Gale\u00e3o, the international airport.Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim, the composer of \u201cThe Girl From Ipanema\u201d (and whose name is now affixed to that airport), famously observed that \u201cBrazil is not for beginners.\u201dIt was not then and it\u2019s not now. It\u2019s a vast diverse country, a tropical United States, whose rich and poor are divided by a chasm. High crime rates are in part a reflection of this divide. Flexibility is at a premium in a culture fashioned by heat, sensuality, samba and rule bending. Life can be cheap. You adapt or you perish.Edmar Bacha, a friend and economist, had coined the term \u201cBelindia\u201d to describe Brazil \u2014 a prosperous Belgium perched atop a teeming India. I wrote a story about the poor kids from north Rio, far from the beaches of Ipanema and Leblon, who would get their kicks as \u201ctrain surfers,\u201d riding the tops of fast-moving trains, rather than surf Atlantic waves. Often they died, electrocuted. I will never forget the twisted corpse of one in the city morgue.Inequity was part of the story, yet even in those tumultuous times it was not all of it. \u201cTudo bem?\u201d \u2014 \u201cAll good?\u201d \u2014 I would ask when I ventured into the ubiquitous favelas, or slums. \u201cTudo bem!\u201d was often the response, along with a smile, even when all was entirely awful. Penury in the sun is not penury in the cold.I once asked the S\u00e3o Paulo industrialist Jos\u00e9 Mindlin if he was worried about where Brazil was headed. \u201cI always worry about the end of the month,\u201d Mindlin said. \u201cBut I never worry about the future.\u201d He was right. Brazil is the graveyard of naysayers.According to the World Bank, life expectancy increased to 74.4 years in 2014 from 63.9 in 1986 (in the same period American life expectancy went up by just four years). Illiteracy is still too high but has fallen sharply.Brazil today is less Belindia than Franconesia \u2014 a substantial France atop an Indonesia. Its problems persist, but only a fool would deny that Brazil will be a major 21st-century player. As anyone attending the Olympics must feel, Brazil has a powerful and joyous national culture. It is the land of \u201cTudo bem.\u201dAll of which is to say that I am tired, very tired, of reading negative stories about these Brazilian Olympics \u2014 the anger in the slums, the violence that continues (including the armed robbery of four American swimmers), the enduring gulf between rich and poor, the occasional organizational hassles, the Russian doping and the Brazilian mosquito, money that could supposedly have been spent better than extending the Metro that now runs from the center to prosperous Barra da Tijuca (so, among other things, enabling the poor to get jobs out there).First, Brazil was never going to get the job done in time for the Olympics; now that it\u2019s shown so much success and held a magnificent opening ceremony, it\u2019s blamed for not having resolved every one of its social problems in time for the Games.There is something in the developed world that does not like a developing country that organizes a major sporting event. I heard the same jeremiads in South Africa at the time of the World Cup in 2010: the crime that would ruin things, the poverty that was shameful and the inefficiency that would plague visitors. The tournament was a triumph. I don\u2019t recall reporters combing the poorest, most crime-ridden parts of Britain in 2012 to find people ready to grumble about the London Olympics.These Olympics are good for Brazil and good for humanity, a needed tonic. Watch Usain Bolt or Simone Biles and feel uplifted.Out in the favelas some kids are dreaming in a different way right now. That, too, is a story.David Brooks is off today.Advertisement"}

Nevertheless, Moaveni is too credulous of Cooper\u2019s allegations that President Jimmy Carter opposed and exaggerated the shah\u2019s human rights abuses.While Carter claimed that human rights would underscore his foreign policy, he effusively praised the shah. During a visit by the Iranian leader to the White House, Carter referred to the Iranian dictator\u2019s \u201cenlightened leadership\u201d and \u201creaffirmed to His Majesty that he fully supports the special relationship\u201d between the two nations \u2014 a relationship characterized in large part by the sale of weapons in one direction and oil in the other.Carter topped even these fulsome tributes a month later in Tehran, declaring, in a mind-numbing misreading of historical momentum: \u201cIran, because of the great leadership of the shah, is an island of stability in one of the more troubled areas of the world.\u201d As Iranian opposition to the shah mounted, the president saw only \u201cthe admiration and love which your people give to you,\u201d adding: \u201cThere is no leader with whom I have a deeper sense of personal gratitude and personal friendship.\u201dTo be sure, some Carter administration officials did take the president\u2019s human rights rhetoric seriously, criticizing the shah for widespread imprisonment and torture of opponents. But Carter for most of his presidency publicly backed this tyrant, ensuring that those who deposed him would direct their ire against the United States as well \u2014 helping to inaugurate 40 years of U.S.-\u00adIranian antagonism, which Presidents Obama and Rouhani have only recently begun to overcome.ROBERT SHAFFERSHIPPENSBURG, PA.The writer is a professor of history at Shippensburg University. \u2b25Is This the Place?To the Editor:If one types \u201cThis Must Be the Place\u201d in Google, information about the movie and the song are the first hits.

{"Headline": "2 Muslim American Women Ordered Off American Airlines Flight", "Date": "2016-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwo Muslim American women were ordered off an American Airlines plane in Miami this week after a flight attendant said that overhearing them talking with other passengers about the lack of food and water on the flight made him uncomfortable, one of the women said.But an American Airlines spokeswoman said that the two were removed for \u201cnoncompliance\u201d and disputed some of the details of Ms. Khalil\u2019s account. She also denied that religion factored into the airline\u2019s decision.Ms. Khalil said that the episode took place on Aug. 2 when she and her friend, a federal government worker she did not identify, boarded Flight 2239 to Washington. The flight was delayed by crew changes, a maintenance issue and bad weather, she wrote.After five hours on the tarmac, during which passengers were given water and pretzels, a white male passenger behind the women initiated a conversation with Ms. Khalil\u2019s friend \u201cabout the lack of customer care,\u201d she wrote.\u201cSuddenly, a male flight attendant walking by singled out my friend and stated, \u2018If you have a problem, you can get off the plane.\u2019 My friend replied, \u2018I have no problem \u2014 I am simply stating facts. We were given one glass of water in five hours,\u2019\u201d Ms. Khalil wrote.\u201cThe attendant responded by once again threatening my friend, \u2018Well, I can have you removed for instigating other passengers,\u2019\u201d the attendant said, according to Ms. Khalil.The flight attendant was not wearing a name badge, so Ms. Khalil\u2019s friend took his photograph to ask another crew member to help identify him. But a third flight attendant told them that the picture was a \u201cfederal offense,\u201d Ms. Khalil said. They were asked to delete the photograph, and did, she added.Ten minutes later, the women were told to take their belongings to the front of the aircraft, where they were informed that they were being removed because the male flight attendant \u201cfelt threatened,\u201d Ms. Khalil wrote, quoting a customer service representative.\u201cHowever, the white male passenger my friend was speaking to was ironically not removed from the plane with us,\u201d she wrote.An American Airlines spokeswoman, Alexis Aran Coello, said on Friday that the order to remove the women was in line with the airline\u2019s \u201cnoncompliance\u201d policy, which, in this case, was related to their being asked to stop taking the photograph of the flight attendant.But Ms. Aran Coello said the crew member had misspoken in saying that it was a federal offense to take the picture. She said the episode took place when the flight attendants and passengers were coping with a long delay.\u201cIt got a little heated,\u201d she added. \u201cPassengers were getting restless, and they started taking it out on the flight attendants.\u201d However, Ms. Aran Coello said, \u201cReligion never, ever came up getting them off the plane.\u201dMs. Aran Coello said the flight attendant later told American Airlines officials that the women were \u201cinciting\u201d other passengers and that he had told them to stop taking photographs of him.They were questioned by French officials, put up in a hotel and flown out the next day, the newspaper reported. Delta said in a statement that it condemns discrimination and was investigating.On Friday, some readers of Ms. Khalil\u2019s account added to the hashtag #flyingwhilemuslim to share their own stories.Ms. Khalil said she and her friend were given $200 travel credits and money for meals, and were booked on another flight. They arrived in Washington the next morning, missing work, she wrote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "1999 Rape Case Swirls Around Nate Parker and His Film \u2018The Birth of a Nation\u2019", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThe Birth of a Nation,\u201d a drama about the Nat Turner slave rebellion, upended the Sundance Film Festival, selling for a record $17.5 million and instantly vaulting to front-runner of next year\u2019s Oscar race.Scheduled to be released Oct. 7, the film is now attracting unwanted attention because of renewed interest in a 17-year-old case in which the film\u2019s director, writer and star, Nate Parker, was accused \u2014 and later acquitted \u2014 of rape when he was a student at Penn State.His college roommate, Jean McGianni Celestin, who received a credit on the movie, was also charged. Last week Deadline.com and Variety asked Mr. Parker about the case, and on Tuesday, Variety reported that his accuser committed suicide in 2012 at age 30.In a statement to The New York Times, the woman\u2019s family said: \u201cWe appreciate that after all this time, these men are being held accountable for their actions. However, we are dubious of the underlying motivations that bring this to present light after 17 years, and we will not take part in stoking its coals. While we cannot protect the victim from this media storm, we can do our best to protect her son. For that reason, we ask for privacy for our family and do not wish to comment further.\u201dBut the woman\u2019s sister, Sharon Loeffler, said that statement did not represent the sentiments of other family members or the woman herself. \u201cI know what she would\u2019ve said,\u201d Ms. Loeffler said, \u201cand that would be, \u2018I fought long and hard, it overcame me. All I can ask is any other victims to come forward, and not let this kind of tolerance to go on anymore.\u2019\u201d Ms. Loeffler said her sister had believed there were other victims and had been broken by the 1999 case and its aftermath. \u201cThese guys sucked the soul and life out of her.\u201dHere\u2019s a look at the case.WHAT WE KNOWMr. Parker was accused in 1999 of raping a fellow student at Penn State. The victim, whose name is not public, said that Mr. Parker and his roommate, Mr. Celestin, raped her while she was intoxicated and unconscious, according to court documents, and that they later harassed, intimidated and stalked her after she pressed charges. Both men said that the sex was consensual.Mr. Parker, who, according to court transcripts, had had consensual oral sex with the woman previously, was acquitted of the charges. Mr. Celestin, who received a \u201cstory by\u201d credit on \u201cThe Birth of a Nation,\u201d was convicted of sexual assault, but his case was appealed. There are conflicting accounts about the outcome.The woman, under the name Jane Doe, then sued Penn State for failing to protect her from harassment; the case was settled for $17,500. According to court records, the victim had twice attempted suicide after the alleged rape. According to a court document, as a result of the harassment, the accuser \u201csuffered severe depression, sleeplessness, and anxiety attacks.\u201d She also said that her apartment had been broken into and that her files on the case had been \u201cdisturbed.\u201dWHAT MR. PARKER HAS SAID ABOUT THE CASE\u201cI talked about it publicly and I never sought to hide it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the most painful thing I have ever had to experience. I can imagine it was painful for a lot of people.\u201dHe also said that he \u201cwelcomed the conversation.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a serious issue. I get it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality is there is a problem on campuses in America, and violence against women is not taken seriously enough. And the dialogue and the discourse isn\u2019t loud enough. I think there\u2019s even more that can be done to educate university students, men and women. Being a father of daughters\u201d \u2014 he has five daughters, three with his wife \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s important to say if something happened, to lift your voice.\u201dHe later said: \u201cThey say the oppressor is anyone who\u2019s not on the side of the oppressed. I stand firmly on the side of the oppressed.\u201dAsked if justice had been served in the case, he replied: \u201cI was cleared of all charges. We\u2019re talking 17 years later. We\u2019re discussing a case which was thoroughly litigated. I was cleared of everything. At some point I have to ask myself, \u2018How often am I willing to relive it?\u2019\u201dWHY THIS IS A STORY NOW\u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d tells the story of Nat Turner, who led a slave rebellion in Virginia in 1831. The film was first screened at the Sundance Film Festival this year, shortly after the all-white slate of Oscar acting nominees set off an outcry as well as a larger conversation about the lack of diversity in Hollywood.Almost everything about the film seemed a remedy to all that, including its name, a sharply pointed reappropriation (not a remake) of D. W. Griffith\u2019s landmark and racist 1915 film of the same title. Born into poverty, Mr. Parker, whose previous films include \u201cThe Secret Life of Bees,\u201d \u201cRed Tails\u201d and \u201cBeyond the Lights,\u201d had made telling Turner\u2019s story a passion project, even turning down other work. He wanted Americans to face the legacy of slavery head on, and said the country\u2019s aversion to doing so led to countless modern-day problems, including tensions between the police and black Americans. Support for the film surged. Last weekend, at the film festival on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Mr. Parker and his co-star, Aja Naomi King, appeared on a panel with Mr. Lee, who urged audience members to pack the theaters when it opens.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Swiping a Screen Rather Than Flip a Page in Baseball", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "Supported byIf a major league coach or player is scrolling through an iPad in the dugout, he is probably not perusing Facebook but rather accessing his scouting reports.Through a partnership with Apple, each team in Major League Baseball has been given eight iPads to use in the dugout and bullpen during games. They are loaded with M.L.B. Dugout, an app that displays scouting reports and other information as well as videos of their opponents.\u201cI think we wanted to kind of make sure that we were able to continue to support and allow our clubs to stay on the cutting edge in terms of technology, and analytics and using statistics to help the sport be a better sport,\u201d said Chris Marinak, M.L.B.\u2019s senior vice president for league economics and strategy.For the most part, the iPads offer information that teams already use, but in a way that is faster and easier to access.The San Francisco Giants have embraced the iPads, and the Giants\u2019 bench coach, Ron Wotus, said that he had eliminated the binders he previously used.\u201cWe\u2019ve always had it in books,\u201d Wotus said. \u201cI\u2019d have to carry two big binders, and you have to flip through papers. So it\u2019s much more efficient.\u201dWotus said he checked the iPad more often during the first games of series against teams outside the Giants\u2019 division.\u201cYou can prepare all day, and you get in the game, we don\u2019t know these clubs as well,\u201d Wotus said. \u201cThere\u2019s always something else that you can look at. So it\u2019s available if I want it, but I would say I\u2019m looking at that more than I was the binders.\u201dTeams were able to test the program at the end of last season. Then, after some enhancements to the app, it became standard at the start of this season. An updated version was released after the All-Star break, allowing coaches to make handwritten notes and look at files side by side.The iPads are different from the ones consumers use. Dugout is the only app clubs can access. Even the camera is disabled.Sean True, the senior director for club services and baseball technology at the commissioner\u2019s office, said the clubs\u2019 top concern was data protection and security.Support staff members load the information that the Giants\u2019 coaches want. For Wotus, that includes scouting reports and spray charts, because he also manages the infield defense. He also uses the video of an opposing player.\u201cYou can look at plots on paper, like a spray chart, and that doesn\u2019t tell you the story,\u201d Wotus said.The Giants\u2019 hitting coach, Hensley Meulens, has players study opposing pitchers in the video room on the first day of a series. But then, when a reliever comes into the game, he will pull up his report on an iPad to provide a refresher.He also keeps a simple sheet of paper on a clipboard with information on the opposing team\u2019s pitchers. A few Giants players look at the paper, but most use an iPad, Meulens said.\u201cIt\u2019s a lot quicker to get to the player you want to get to, because you just click on him and it opens up,\u201d Meulens said. \u201cOtherwise, you have to try to find the guy as time is running.\u201dFor Mets Manager Terry Collins, turning a page is still quicker, although he also said the iPads were useful.\u201cI know people that are a lot more familiar using them are glad they\u2019re in there,\u201d he said.Meulens said he still kept a binder for backup in case of an iPad malfunction. And when several players are trying to look up information at the same time, it can be helpful to have three options: the iPad, the binder and the cheat sheet on the clipboard.The St. Louis Cardinals are one club that has not quite fully adopted the iPads. Cardinals reliever Matt Bowman said much of the team\u2019s bullpen information was relayed orally. And if he has a question, he will refer back to the bullpen coach, Blaise Ilsley.\u201cSo he\u2019s sort of our iPad in that sense,\u201d Bowman said.Baltimore Orioles Manager Buck Showalter said he would check an iPad in the dugout occasionally, sometimes when a new pitcher entered the game. But perhaps memory, at least Showalter\u2019s, is one thing the iPads can\u2019t trump.\u201cIf you\u2019re referring to that a lot when you\u2019re out here, you haven\u2019t done your homework,\u201d Showalter said. \u201cI usually have it, believe it or not, stored upstairs.\u201d James Wagner contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Women Who Won\u2019t Wear Swimsuits", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "Supported by\u201cThis isn\u2019t a real thing,\u201d my husband grumbled as he followed me up the stairs one morning in June.He didn\u2019t understand.Woman versus swimsuit is a tale as old as \u2014 well, maybe just as old as that yellowing \u201cCathy\u201d cartoon that your mom stuck on the fridge, underneath a bovine-shaped magnet that read \u201cHoly Cow, Are You Eating Again?\u201dIn the grand scheme of things, feeling bad about your jiggly bits as you wrestle them into scraps of Lycra in the unforgiving light of a department-store dressing room doesn\u2019t compare with not having food or clean water. That being said, there are women out there who just don\u2019t. They don\u2019t wear swimsuits. They don\u2019t go to the beach. They basically forgo summer, and the camera, because they hate the way they look.Thus, our excursion to the roof.I put on sunscreen, and lipstick, and a new size 16 swimsuit, black with a ruffled pink trim and a little slip of a skirt. I took a deep breath, pulled my shoulders back, and tried to believe that I looked O.K. and not to flinch as he said, \u201cHere we go.\u201dInside, I picked out my favorite shot, skipped the filters, went to my Facebook page, held my breath and hit \u201cpost.\u201d The next time I looked, there were dozens of pictures of women in swimsuits \u2014 women who looked more like me, less like the airbrushed, perfected creatures I seem to spend my life looking at.Then, during the Olympics, in between commentators\u2019 cracks about how a female swimmer\u2019s husband was actually the one responsible for her gold medal, or how our gymnasts looked as if they should have been hanging out at a mall, you could actually see larger bodies being celebrated for their achievements; bodies that were winning medals as opposed to being \u201cbefores\u201d on those weight-loss reality shows.There was Michelle Carter, who calls herself the Shot Diva, all lashes and fuchsia lips, and thick, muscular arms and solid thighs. Arms like mine! Legs like mine! Except hers heaved the shot a gold-medal-winning distance.Both women seemed comfortable in their own skin, proud of what their bodies could accomplish.It was so good to hear, and so rare. The Olympians are the outliers; their words a dissent to the daily chorus that tells us, and tells us, and tells us that larger bodies are loathsome, are laughable, are undeserving of love.I was lucky. I had a mom who was always swimming, even when the choices of swimsuits for larger bodies were limited to horrid floral skirted things that flapped and dragged in the water while she churned out her daily mile. Staying on land, I learned, was not an option, especially when I had babies of my own to hold and help.And so, even at my heaviest I never hesitated to put on a bathing suit and go in the water. Maybe that\u2019s why my husband couldn\u2019t understand: that there are women out there for whom bathing suits are very big deals; women who maybe could use a little push.I wasn\u2019t expecting #weartheswimsuit, the hashtag I used for that first Facebook photo, to take off the way it did. By the end of the week in June when I posted it, after some blogs had noticed and I got to talk about it on morning television, my Facebook page was overflowing with pictures of women of all shapes and sizes. Women on beaches, on floats, on stand-up paddleboards; women water-skiing or leaping off docks or cradling their babies in the kiddie pool.Then there were comments that made me cry. One woman wrote that she and her family had been going to the shore for over a decade and, \u201cthis was the first time I wore a suit. Another wrote: \u201cI have downright refused to wear a suit for YEARS. I avoid swimming altogether, and it\u2019s actually one of my favorite things to do.\u201dThis is how it is, for so many women. We endure the summer heat, swathed in cover-ups, sweating in sleeved shirts. We become inured to the indignities: hearing casual fat jokes, knowing that exercising in public means risking mockery; seeing strong, healthy, larger bodies once every four years, winning gold medals but somehow never getting many big-dollar endorsement deals or a gig on \u201cDancing With the Stars.\u201dThese are the images I want to take with me from this summer: Sarah Robles\u2019s smile; Michelle Carter\u2019s confidence, and what my Facebook friend Jaime Rydman wrote beneath a shot of herself in a black one-piece with waves frothing around her ankles and wrote, \u201cI\u2019d always say \u2018this will make a good \u2018before\u2019 picture. I need to stop ... it makes a good NOW picture!\u201dJennifer Weiner is the author of the forthcoming memoir \u201cHungry Heart,\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

She will compete on the first refugee team at an Olympics, a feat that was unthinkable less than a year ago when she was neck-deep in the Mediterranean Sea swimming for her life.Last August, Mardini and her sister Sarah fled war-torn Syria and embarked on a harrowing, monthlong journey through Lebanon, Turkey and Greece, up through the Balkans and Central Europe, to Germany, narrowly dodging capture and death. When their crammed dinghy broke down between Turkey and Greece, she and her sister, also a swimmer, jumped into the water and helped guide the boat to safety.Mardini\u2019s story came to public attention in March when she was identified by the International Olympic Committee as a candidate to compete on a new team of refugees, made up of athletes who are stateless or would otherwise be excluded from the Games. She was thrust into the spotlight, celebrated by the news media as a fresh-faced example of Germany\u2019s so-called welcome culture \u2014 a story of uplift at the center of the global refugee crisis.Mardini was officially named to the refugee team in June along with nine athletes from Syria, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Ethiopia. The team will compete under the Olympic flag and anthem, entering the Maracan\u00e3 stadium on Friday for the opening ceremony next to last, just before host Brazil. Mardini will compete in the 100-meter freestyle and the 100-meter butterfly.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be really cool,\u201d she said, throwing a hot-pink Nike backpack onto a table in the cafeteria of the training center.She had found out a few weeks earlier that she had made the Olympic team from a group of journalists who had come to the apartment where she now lives with her sister.\u201cBecause actually I never open my emails,\u201d Mardini said.Then, she said, the journalists told her that a friend of hers, Rami Anis, also a Syrian swimmer, had made the team as well. \u201cThat\u2019s when it was like, Ahh!\u201d Mardini said.Mardini had changed into a zip-up hooded sweatshirt (a gift from the German swimwear brand Arena) and blow-dried her hair into shimmery, past-the-shoulder layers. In each ear she wore two studs: a pearl and a rhinestone.Mardini swings between frenetic, uncontainable excitement and half-bored preoccupation. She sends text messages frequently. In other words, she is a normal teenager.\u201cWhen I was a little kid, I was just put into the water,\u201d said Mardini, who grew up in the Daraya suburb of Damascus. Her father, a swimming coach, began training her when she was 3. Mardini went on to compete for the Syrian national team and received support from the Syrian Olympic Committee.But then war broke out in 2011, when she was 13, and Mardini saw her relatively idyllic life begin to transform.\u201cAll the sudden you couldn\u2019t go where you wanted, or your mom calls you when you\u2019re on your way and says, \u2018Come back; there\u2019s something happening there,\u2019\u201d she said.School would be canceled for several days, she said, \u201cor someone is shooting, and then you have to run.\u201dYet within the world of her friends and classmates, Mardini said, life for the most part went on as usual. \u201cWe never talked about the war,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was annoying! In the beginning, everyone talked about it, but then after a few years, we were like: \u2018O.K., if I\u2019m going to die, I\u2019m going to die! But let me live my life. I want to see my friends!\u2019\u201d\u201cI told my mom, \u2018O.K., enough is enough,\u2019\u201d Mardini said. \u201cAnd she said, \u2018Fine, find someone I can trust to take you, and you can go.\u2019\u201dOn Aug. 12, 2015, Mardini and her sister left with two of their father\u2019s cousins and another friend. They flew from Damascus to Beirut, Lebanon, to Istanbul, where they connected with smugglers and a group of about 30 refugees with whom they stayed for the duration of the journey.The group was bused to Izmir, Turkey, and then taken to a wooded area near the seaside to wait to board a boat to the Greek island Lesbos.\u201cWe thought we were the only bus, but there were four or five busloads every day,\u201d Mardini said. \u201cThere were 200, 300 people there, everyone waiting until there are no police in the sea so they can go.\u201dAt night, helicopters patrolled the area, she said, but the Turkish authorities never entered the forest.\u201cThe police are afraid because the smugglers have guns,\u201d Mardini said. The smugglers, she said, \u201cwere not afraid.\u201dAfter four days, Mardini and her sister were packed with 18 other people, including a 6-year-old boy, on a dinghy meant to accommodate six. On their first attempt, they were caught by border agents and sent back. On their second, the engine died after about 20 minutes, and the dinghy took on water.Of the 20 people on board, only the Mardini sisters and two young men knew how to swim, so the four of them jumped overboard. It was about 7 at night, and the turning tide had made the sea harsh and choppy.\u201cEveryone was praying,\u201d Mardini said. \u201cWe were calling the Turkish police, the Greek police, saying: \u2018Please, please help us. We have children! We are drowning!\u2019 And they just kept saying: \u2018Turn and go back. Turn and go back.\u2019\u201dMardini and her sister swam for three and a half hours, helping the boat stay on course \u2014 even when the two male swimmers gave up and let the dinghy pull them along. It was cold, Mardini said. Her clothes dragged her down, and salt burned her eyes and skin.\u201cI\u2019m thinking, what? I\u2019m a swimmer, and I\u2019m going to die in the water in the end?\u201d she said.But she was determined to keep a good attitude \u2014 and not just for her own sake.\u201cThe little kid kept looking at me, scared,\u201d she said, \u201cso I was doing all these funny faces.\u201dEventually the boat made it to shore in Lesbos, but the journey was only beginning. The people in the group walked for days at a time, sleeping in fields or churches. Even though they had money, taxis refused to stop for them, and restaurants often refused them service.\u201cBut there were good people, too,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I arrived, I didn\u2019t have any shoes, and there was a Greek girl \u2014 I think, the same age as me \u2014 and she saw us and gave us a pullover for the young kid, and she gave me her shoes.\u201dThe sisters traveled by foot or on buses run by smugglers from Greece through Macedonia up through Serbia and into Hungary. They were in Budapest in September when Hungarian authorities closed the main train station to refugees. Many, including the Mardini sisters, had spent hundreds of euros on train tickets that they were then prohibited from using, prompting hundreds of refugees to protest outside the station.\u201cI was just watching,\u201d Mardini said. \u201cI was like: \u2018Where am I? And what\u2019s going to happen if they take me to jail now?\u2019\u201dEventually they made it out of Hungary, traveling through Austria and finally to Germany, where they ended up in a refugee camp in Berlin sharing a tent with six men they had traveled with.\u201cI was happy!\u201d Mardini said, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t have any problems. I\u2019m in Germany. I have my sister. That\u2019s it.\u201dThe Mardini sisters spent much of their first German winter waiting in long lines at the main refugee registry point \u2014 the State Office of Health and Social Affairs, known by its German acronym, Lageso \u2014 to get their asylum papers in order. They often had to wait outside for eight hours in freezing temperatures only to be turned away and told to come back the next day.\u201cHere in Lageso, I cried more than during the trip,\u201d Mardini said.At first, getting back in the water was the last thing on her mind, but after some weeks, she said, she began to long for it \u2014 especially when she heard a fellow competitor had won a competition in Asia.\u201cI was like: \u2018Mom! Ahh! I should be there! I\u2019m better than her!\u2019\u201d she said.An Egyptian interpreter who helped out frequently at the refugee camp connected Mardini with nearby Wasserfreunde Spandau, and Sven Spannekrebs, a longtime trainer for the club, agreed to give her a tryout. When he saw Mardini swim, Spannekrebs said, he was impressed.\u201cThe technical foundation was really good,\u201d said Spannekrebs, who joined Mardini in the cafeteria for lunch after her morning swim. \u201cAfter two years without training, it was just that the aerobic foundation was not good. Her body was in bad shape.\u201d\u201cI was not that bad!\u201d Mardini said, dropping her cutlery in protest. He shot her an exaggerated look of incredulity. She grinned and conceded, \u201cO.K., 25 days eating Burger King and McDonald\u2019s.\u201dNot long after he started training Mardini, Spannekrebs became convinced she could be a candidate for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. But when they learned the International Olympic Committee might be building a refugee team, he and Mardini realized her Olympic dreams could come true sooner than expected. In January, the committee granted her a training scholarship, and Spannekrebs started Mardini on a rigorous daily schedule: two two-hour sessions in the water and another hour of dry-land aerobic training, with school sessions in between.\u201cShe\u2019s a really tough athlete,\u201d he said.A medal in Rio is out of reach. Mardini\u2019s fastest times are 1 minute 8 seconds in the 100-meter butterfly and 1:02 in the 100-meter freestyle, a good nine and 11 seconds behind the official Olympic qualifying times for those events.\u201cI\u2019m expecting personal best,\u201d Mardini said.Mardini used some of the scholarship money to get an apartment with her sister not too far from the training center. Her parents and her two younger sisters have now joined them in Berlin, and the whole family has been granted temporary asylum.Mardini said she would like to use the attention she had received to help other refugees. Eventually she hopes to return to Syria to share her story with people there.\u201cI remember everything, of course,\u201d she said. \u201cI never forget. But it\u2019s the thing that\u2019s pushing me actually to do more and more.\u201dShe added, \u201cCrying in the corner, that\u2019s just not me.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "In the mid-1970s, alarmed by the rapid rise of a neo-fascist political party that was embracing white supremacism, a radical coalition of socially engaged artists and leftist activists emerged in Britain. Infused by the international counterculture of the 1960s and with close ties\u00c2\u00a0to the Socialist Workers Party, this group sought to fight fascism through music.Rock Against Racism would be a turning point in British cultural, political and social history. The social movement helped put an end to an alarming ascendance of ultranationalism among white youth and articulated a new generational consciousness that transcended class and race boundaries.An exhibition of the same name is on display at Impressions Gallery in Bradford, England. Curated by Mark Sealy, director of the photography nonprofit Autograph ABP, and Prof. Carol Tulloch\u00c2\u00a0of the\u00c2\u00a0University of the Arts London, the show is a vivid testimony to an organization whose strategy was to take seriously identity, culture and politics.It is also a tribute to the extraordinary pictures taken of this vibrant movement by the British artist Syd Shelton.Awakened to politics in his youth through involvement in the nuclear disarmament movement, Mr. Shelton captured the rise of Rock Against Racism with an electric mastery.Mr. Shelton reflected via email on the founding of the movement, which involved his friend and photographer Red Saunders.In 1976, the musician Eric Clapton urged his fans to \u00e2\u0080\u009cKeep Britain white\u00e2\u0080\u009d during a concert in Birmingham, leading\u00c2\u00a0Mr. Saunders to write a letter to the music news media\u00c2\u00a0in response.\u00e2\u0080\u009cRed and the letter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other signatories called for a rank-and-file movement called Rock Against Racism to fight the racist poison,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Shelton recalled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe response was immediate and phenomenal with over 800 replies within the first few days.\u00e2\u0080\u009dOver the next five years, Mr. Shelton became\u00c2\u00a0deeply involved in the movement, emerging as an activist, photographer and one of the main designers of its magazine, Temporary Hoarding.From 1976 to 1981, Rock Against Racism organized marches against the neo-fascist National Front and put on\u00c2\u00a0more than\u00c2\u00a0500 concerts throughout Britain, including two anti-fascists events in London that each attracted more than 100,000 people.Under the anthem \u00e2\u0080\u009cLove Music, Hate Racism,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rock Against Racism united Asian, black and white urban youth, forging\u00c2\u00a0lasting connections between different cultural repertoires.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe main black bands had played to black audiences and white bands to white,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Shelton said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cU.K. reggae and punk grew out of the same political roots. They were both rebel music. It seemed natural to mix punk and reggae bands on the same stage. In fact that mix was in itself a theatrical argument for multiculturalism. The fans at R.A.R. gigs were for the first time the most diverse fans ever assembled in the U.K.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Shelton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pictures convey the reparative joy of a black and white audience dancing to the tunes performed by reggae bands such as Aswad, Dambala and Misty in Roots, as well as those of punk groups\u00c2\u00a0that were\u00c2\u00a0heavily influenced by Rastafarian ideals, like Generation X, Sham 69 and the Clash.Those performances were not immune to the violence that so often afflicted Asian and black communities. Concerts were sometimes disrupted by National Front skinheads, while some musicians were threatened for their political stance.A few pictures by Mr. Shelton capture these moments of palpable tension and, ultimately, of bravery.Mr. Shelton remembered shooting one such moment in 1978, when death threats forced Jimmy Percy of Sham 69 to pull out of a Brixton music festival.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was at the back of the stage reloading my cameras with film when Jimmy finally burst onto the stage and grabbed the mic and addressed the crowd of 150,000 with a passionate anti-racist speech and pledged his belief in Rock Against Racism,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Shelton said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe then turned his face, contorted with angst, and looked at me for a fraction of a second and was gone.\u201d\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis was both a photographic decisive moment and an anti-racist decisive moment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.Reflecting on the aftermath of\u00c2\u00a0Britain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cBrexit\u00e2\u0080\u009d vote, which has already been followed\u00c2\u00a0by hundreds of incidents of racial abuse and hate crimes, Mr. Shelton noted that \u00e2\u0080\u009cracism is like shifting sand. It finds new targets at which to direct its hate. If we learn any lessons from this Brexit era, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that we always have to continue the fight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}
{"Headline": "Officials Spent Big on Olympics, but Rio Natives Are Paying the Price", "Date": "2016-08-14", "News": "Supported bySports of The TimesRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 A thousand metaphysical miles from the well-heeled Olympic zone, a couple of activists and I entered the Favela do Mandela, a ramshackle collection of brick-and-tar-paper buildings. We walked a narrow road ringed by wary-eyed young men, which led to a narrower one, which led to a five-foot-wide alleyway. We found the home of 64-year-old Marie Auxiliadora.With blond hair brushed back, she was a diminutive eruption of joy. She apologized for her modest home, scrubbed and packed with crucifixes and plastic flowers and pastel curtains. She wore a sun dress and pink flip-flops. Although morning gunfire had earlier forced her to hide in her bedroom, she insisted hers had been a good life. She noted she had four beautiful adult children, thank God. On her television, we watched demonstrators protest the presence of the Olympic torch on the day before the Olympics started.She pursed her lips and put her hands over her chest.\u201cI am so upset,\u201d she said. Her eyes turned red-rimmed. \u201cI have not gotten my retirement check for a month. Our hospitals and schools are broken. Shooting every day, and they spend all of our money on this Olympics.\u201cThe rich play, and we die.\u201dSeen from the northern and western precincts of Rio de Janeiro, which sprawl inland from the green Tijuca forest and the coastal mountain spine, the Olympics inhabit a foreign and wealthy world.In two days of wandering through favelas and working-class neighborhoods, I found Olympic excitement an often extinguished fire. Graffiti and signs draped across walls by labor activists document the Games\u2019 huge cost to a wounded city. Olympic torchbearers jogged into several working-class neighborhoods and left sprinting, chased by angry residents. Outrage is not difficult to understand.Billionaire developers and media magnates have made a fortune off the Olympics; bribe and corruption investigations arising from these Games are a growth industry, with construction companies and hundreds of congressional deputies potentially in the dock. An extremely expensive subway was built to run the length of this city\u2019s well-to-do south coast from Copacabana to the Olympic site. A forest of towers to house athletes rose on publicly owned land; afterward, the developer will turn these into luxury housing. On the route from the international airport to the south shore, Olympic organizers put up colorful walls so that visitors could not see the favelas.The International Olympic Committee\u2019s chieftain, Thomas Bach, proclaimed the Rio Games a grand success last week. I wondered at the quality of his eyes.To write of pain is to take nothing from the Brazilians, who are gracious hosts and exuberant fans, crowding the waterfront of Copacabana for beach volleyball. Grand athletic achievement is inspiring, and these athletes, the world\u2019s greatest, deserve applause. But the practiced I.O.C. shakedown of cities, the demands that local officials compete to construct obscenely expensive stadiums and news media centers and to guarantee that tourist zones have been swept of the desperate, has rarely looked more problematic.Rio is all but bankrupt. Teachers have gone months without pay. Retirees are months behind on pension checks. University professors gather to mop floors and empty overflowing garbage cans.I talked to a hospital administrator in a northern neighborhood who asked that I not use his name for fear he might lose his job. Officials had instructed him, he said, to reserve beds in overcrowded wards and to put aside hard-to-obtain medicines, such as blood pressure pills, for Olympic tourists. His hospital received a new ambulance to serve the Olympics.I traveled this day in the company of Anderson Franca, a sturdy, bearded activist, writer and researcher, and his wife, Suelen Masiero. Anderson sees a bill of lading for decades of neglect come due.\u201cIn a way, the Olympics are to be congratulated,\u201d he says. \u201cThe contradictions of this city are emerging faster and more dramatically.\u201dLater, we will put the question of the Olympics to Geovane Prince, a muscular, tattooed photographer in the Mandela favela. He has created a thriving studio and travels about the city. He shakes his head before I get the question out.\u201cAll the corruption, the suffering, there is too much pain,\u201d he says. \u201cWe protest. To keep building giant arenas in the wealthy zone? We are sick of investing in this.\u201dViolence is a caldron still boiling and cannot be separated from this Olympic antipathy. In advance of the 2014 World Cup and now the Olympics, the police and the military pushed at the point of semiautomatic rifles and armored cars into hundreds of favelas in brutal pacification campaigns. Homicides dropped significantly but spiked again this year. New York City recorded 350 murders in 2015. Rio de Janeiro, a state with roughly double the population of New York City, recorded 461 murders in April 2016 alone.At 8:30 a.m. last week, we traveled toward the Complexo do Alem\u00e3o favela, which sprawls across four hills. We stopped at a traffic light. Crack-pop, crack-pop. I tilted my head; it sounded like firecrackers, except not really. The driver in the car next to ours rolled his eyes. The paramilitaries and drug gangs, he said through his open window, shoot early this morning.\u201cYou see that hill?\u201d Franca, the activist and my guide this day, said as he pointed toward a green mountain ridge. Tumbledown homes climbed its slopes; azure skies rose above. Those were the Mercy Hills. \u201cThey found a mass grave with dozens of bodies. No names.\u201dI talked later to a woman who owned a modest grocery store on another hillside in this favela. She cradled her baby granddaughter. \u201cNo one can even get together to watch a game,\u201d she said. \u201cThe occupation is too dangerous.\u201dHers was an often repeated observation. Residents want peace, but they harbor no particular rooting interest in the army or the drug gangs or the paramilitaries composed of retired cops: All armies are lethal.We scrambled up a hardscrabble path to the new police precinct that commands the hill like a medieval castle keep. Inside, three police officers in body armor nodded warily.They pointed to one, two, three bullet holes in the glass windows of the precinct, each the size of a Ping-Pong ball; the police attack, and the gangs counterattack. The precinct wall is dominated by a painting of a knight kneeling and holding his sword, accompanied by these words: \u201cYou may die, but if you don\u2019t fight, you\u2019re already dead.\u201dThe precinct commander walked in, a semiautomatic rifle strapped to his chest. \u201cYou should not stay here \u2014 go back to the Olympics,\u201d he said. \u201cShooting is anytime.\u201dOfficials cut several bus lines that run north to south during the Olympics, in hope of keeping gangs from invading the tourist zones of Copacabana and Ipanema and the central business district. Many tens of thousands of working-class Cariocas, as natives of Rio are known, spend two and a half to three hours commuting to distant jobs, journeys made far more arduous during the Games. Anderson\u2019s mother lives in a favela. She is in her ninth decade and has never visited the white sand beaches of Copacabana and Ipanema.The next day, I talked with Carla Maria Avesani, a young professor at the Rio de Janeiro state university. She has a Ph.D. and runs a nutrition institute at the University of Rio de Janeiro. She serves on the board of a prestigious journal and writes for an international audience of academics. She studies how changes in diet help poor patients on dialysis and those with heart problems. It was her dream to work at a public university with a mission.Now she and her fellow professors pool their Brazilian reais to buy computers and paper towels, and to fix doors. They try to figure out what to do about the broken elevator. Their university is broke, its pockets turned out.She lives in an upper-middle-class neighborhood, with good restaurants and that Mediterranean climate. The evening atmosphere, with young couples hand in hand, calls to mind Rome, except with enormous rock faces nearby and an ocean lapping at your feet. She watched the opening ceremony, all the brilliant choreographies, and read her friends\u2019 proud posts on Facebook.She could not join them.\u201cIt was a beautiful party; we Brazilians do wonderful parties,\u201d Avesani said. \u201cBut to see the amount of money spent for stupid stadiums, I don\u2019t want to celebrate when the state is broke and hospitals are closing and the poor are dying by the thousands.\u201dShe paused. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see so many foreigners, and I want you to be happy. I want to be happy.\u201dShe sighed. \u201cI would be happiest now if the world sees how we are living. I feel absolutely offended by these Olympics.\u201dEmail: powellm@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Paul LePage, Besieged Maine Governor, Sends Conflicting Signals Over Intentions", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "Supported byAUGUSTA, Me. \u2014 The beleaguered Republican governor of Maine seemed on Tuesday to back off from hints that he might quit in the midst of a controversy over his latest tirades of obscene, threatening and racially charged remarks, as Republican lawmakers in the House rallied to quash the possibility of formally rebuking him \u2014 or worse \u2014 for his erratic behavior.\u201cIt\u2019s really one thing to have one party behind you,\u201d Mr. LePage said on the radio, in an interview that was at times uncharacteristically self-effacing. \u201cIt\u2019s another thing not to have any party behind you.\u201dBut in the early afternoon, in a Twitter message, Mr. LePage seemed to have regained his spirit of defiance.\u201cRegarding rumors of resignation, to paraphrase Mark Twain, \u2018The reports of my political demise are greatly exaggerated,\u2019\u201d the message read. Mr. LePage was spending much of the day in the town of Baileyville, 170 miles from here, near the Canadian border.By nighttime, it was clear there was a basis for the governor\u2019s renewed swagger, as House Republican leaders said they would not join the calls to convene a special session, which would have raised the possibility of impeachment.\u201cWe believe that the governor is addressing this issue,\u201d said State Representative Kenneth Fredette, an ally of Mr. LePage\u2019s and the minority leader of the House. \u201cWe are not interested in coming back in a special session.\u201dSpeaking with reporters after the caucus meeting, Mr. Fredette condemned Mr. LePage\u2019s remarks \u2014 \u201cNo one agrees with what the governor said or did,\u201d he said \u2014 and asserted that \u201cno one gets a free pass.\u201d But he then seemed to give one to Mr. LePage, saying that a special session would distract voters from important issues ahead of the fall election.Since he was elected in 2010 and re-elected in 2014, Mr. LePage has had at least nine political lives and been able to ride out waves of controversy, often provoked by his harsh, insulting and racially charged statements. The outbursts have angered Democrats and embarrassed moderate Republicans, yet left largely unruffled a political base drawn to the former businessman\u2019s unfiltered style.Democrats and some Senate Republicans raised the possibility of a special session to consider ways to rebuke the governor, but such a session could be held only with the approval of half of both caucuses in each legislative chamber. The House Republican caucus held the line after meeting at 6 p.m.The caucus meeting followed days of controversy, after Mr. LePage stated at a town-hall meeting last Wednesday that the vast majority of heroin dealers in Maine were black and Hispanic.As criticism swelled, Mr. LePage came to believe that a Democratic lawmaker, Drew Gattine, had called him a racist, and left him a threatening voice mail threaded with obscenities, which he followed by suggesting that he and Mr. Gattine have a duel.On Friday, Mr. LePage reiterated his comments about drugs and race, showing reporters a binder of people arrested on drug charges and asserting that black and Hispanic people from out of state were the \u201cenemy.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just so nonproductive,\u201d Ms. Volk said in an interview on Tuesday. \u201cAnd so offensive to law-abiding citizens of color, that they would be somehow lumped in with people that are breaking the law just because of the color of their skin.\u201dDemocratic leaders said they would continue to call for the governor\u2019s resignation.\u201cWhat the House Republicans have done is slammed the door on their willingness to actually address this behavior at this time,\u201d said Jeff McCabe, the Democratic majority leader of the House, on Tuesday night. \u201cWe think that we can work with Senate Republicans as well as some House Republicans who we know are not happy with tonight\u2019s display of political theater.\u201dMr. LePage met with Republican legislative leaders on Monday, when he was urged to take steps like apologizing directly to the lawmaker he had threatened, and was asked to seek help, professional or otherwise, according to a person briefed on the discussions.He went on to say that he was looking at \u201coptions,\u201d conceding that his remarks had cost him crucial support.\u201cIf I\u2019ve lost my ability to convince the Maine people that\u2019s what we need and that\u2019s the type of people we need in Augusta, then you know, maybe it is time to move on,\u201d he said. His later Twitter message ridiculed any talk of his stepping down.In the morning\u2019s radio interview, he also defended his comments on drugs and race, saying linking the two were \u201cfact,\u201d and adding, \u201cAll lives matter.\u201d\u201cEvery drug arrest we get the story, and the people, and when it comes to meth labs, they\u2019re essentially all Maine white people,\u201d Mr. LePage said. \u201cWhen it comes to the heroin epidemic, it\u2019s just the opposite.\u201dThe imbroglio seems to have strengthened some Republicans\u2019 commitment to Mr. LePage in some parts of the state; in Lewiston on Monday night, a bartender and a patron high-fived when they realized they both still supported the governor. But it has left those who associate more strongly with the state\u2019s tradition of moderate Republicans, like Senator Susan Collins or Margaret Chase Smith, trying to explain his actions.\u201cIt seems to be the norm now to speak what\u2019s on your mind now without a filter,\u201d said Wendy Ault, a former Republican state representative and a member of the Early College Task Force appointed by Mr. LePage, adding, \u201cI believe in civilized discourse.\u201dAdvertisement"}

She also denied that religion factored into the airline\u2019s decision.Ms. Khalil said that the episode took place on Aug. 2 when she and her friend, a federal government worker she did not identify, boarded Flight 2239 to Washington. The flight was delayed by crew changes, a maintenance issue and bad weather, she wrote.After five hours on the tarmac, during which passengers were given water and pretzels, a white male passenger behind the women initiated a conversation with Ms. Khalil\u2019s friend \u201cabout the lack of customer care,\u201d she wrote.\u201cSuddenly, a male flight attendant walking by singled out my friend and stated, \u2018If you have a problem, you can get off the plane.\u2019 My friend replied, \u2018I have no problem \u2014 I am simply stating facts. We were given one glass of water in five hours,\u2019\u201d Ms. Khalil wrote.\u201cThe attendant responded by once again threatening my friend, \u2018Well, I can have you removed for instigating other passengers,\u2019\u201d the attendant said, according to Ms. Khalil.The flight attendant was not wearing a name badge, so Ms. Khalil\u2019s friend took his photograph to ask another crew member to help identify him. But a third flight attendant told them that the picture was a \u201cfederal offense,\u201d Ms. Khalil said. They were asked to delete the photograph, and did, she added.Ten minutes later, the women were told to take their belongings to the front of the aircraft, where they were informed that they were being removed because the male flight attendant \u201cfelt threatened,\u201d Ms. Khalil wrote, quoting a customer service representative.\u201cHowever, the white male passenger my friend was speaking to was ironically not removed from the plane with us,\u201d she wrote.An American Airlines spokeswoman, Alexis Aran Coello, said on Friday that the order to remove the women was in line with the airline\u2019s \u201cnoncompliance\u201d policy, which, in this case, was related to their being asked to stop taking the photograph of the flight attendant.But Ms. Aran Coello said the crew member had misspoken in saying that it was a federal offense to take the picture. She said the episode took place when the flight attendants and passengers were coping with a long delay.\u201cIt got a little heated,\u201d she added. \u201cPassengers were getting restless, and they started taking it out on the flight attendants.\u201d However, Ms. Aran Coello said, \u201cReligion never, ever came up getting them off the plane.\u201dMs. Aran Coello said the flight attendant later told American Airlines officials that the women were \u201cinciting\u201d other passengers and that he had told them to stop taking photographs of him.They were questioned by French officials, put up in a hotel and flown out the next day, the newspaper reported.

{"Headline": "From Humans of New York to Obama\u2019s Office: How a Principal Built a School", "Date": "2016-08-25", "News": "Supported byNonfictionNadia Lopez is an unlikely star of the internet age \u2014 an urban-middle-school principal whose story went viral. It all began in January 2015 when the blog Humans of New York featured an eighth grader at her school named Vidal. \u201cWho\u2019s influenced you the most in your life?\u201d the young boy bundled in a hoodie and a black jacket was asked. \u201cMy principal,\u201d he answered. A few days later, Brandon Stanton, the photographer responsible for the blog, visited Lopez and her school, Mott Hall Bridges Academy, in the Brownsville neighborhood of Brooklyn. There he found a young principal striving to turn a public school into a bulwark against the forces of urban distress. She became an overnight sensation.Lopez and Vidal were guests on Ellen DeGeneres\u2019s television show and \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d and President Obama met with them in the Oval Office. Target donated $100,000 worth of iPads and other electronics to Mott Hall Bridges and other schools in Brownsville. A crowdfunding campaign started by Stanton raised more than $1.4 million for Lopez\u2019s school of roughly 200 sixth-through-eighth graders, and Stanton\u2019s post about Vidal garnered more than a million \u201clikes\u201d on Facebook. Lopez used some of the money to take her students on a tour of Harvard University in hopes of inspiring them to reach far beyond Brooklyn. Harvard\u2019s president, Drew Gilpin Faust, personally addressed them, as did four undergraduates from poor communities and \u00adsingle-parent homes, and several professors delivered middle-school versions of their regular lectures.And then the spotlight moved elsewhere, leaving Lopez, her teachers and her students to soldier on without the nation\u2019s beneficence and attention. That day-in, day-out struggle is the subject of \u201cThe Bridge to Brilliance: How One Principal in a Tough Community Is Inspiring the World.\u201dWhile the book, which Lopez wrote with Rebecca Paley, reads at times as if it had been rushed into print to capitalize on the social media buzz, it offers a valuable depiction of what it takes for principals and teachers to reach children in the most troubled communities. The students of Mott Hall Bridges are almost all Latino or African-American; they are growing up in deep poverty amid traumatizing violence. Thirty percent have learning disabilities, more than twice the national average. Lopez\u2019s mission, as she sees it, is \u201csimply to take care of kids everyone else seemed to want to forget.\u201dShe recounts working late nights, weekends and holidays, tutoring and counseling struggling students. She takes a boy who had never been to a bookstore to the flagship Barnes & Noble in Manhattan. She spends every day of her spring break tutoring a student who was failing both reading and math. She sets up social clubs for boys (I Matter) and girls (She Is Me). She helps a boy whose mother has died start a support group for children who have lost a parent.Mott Hall Bridges is a district school, not a charter school, but Lopez steers clear of the polarizing debate between advocates of those two formats. Still, she makes clear her disapproval of so-called no-excuses charter schools, citing one with high test scores in Brooklyn so punitive that in her view some students \u201ccould easily wind up incarcerated in part from constantly being reminded that they are not good enough.\u201d She also strongly objects to the nationwide practice of rating teachers and schools based on student test scores. Many of her own students scored \u201cbelow proficient\u201d or \u201cwell below proficient\u201d on state exams.\u201cWhat began to weigh heavy on me,\u201d Lopez writes, \u201cwas that at the same time I was struggling to get my scholars and their families to believe in themselves, I was part of an educational system that, despite its best intentions, only reinforced their failures.\u201d In late 2014, she fell prey to insomnia and developed a debilitating chronic immune disease. Sometimes, alone in her office, she found herself in tears. \u201cI was broken,\u201d she confesses. Then Brandon Stanton showed up with his camera and gave her a second wind.It\u2019s telling that social media rather than our system of public education helped Lopez find the strength to go on. Her book will give readers even more reasons to ask what we as a society are doing to support the thousands of educators who labor in obscurity, trying to help the nation\u2019s most vulnerable children.Dale Russakoff is the author of \u201cThe Prize: Who\u2019s in Charge of America\u2019s Schools?,\u201d which has just been released in paperback.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Intel\u2019s New Mission: Find Fresh Uses for Its Famous Paranoia", "Date": "2016-08-14", "News": "Supported byBitsThat sounds cool, if you like your capitalism fierce. That idea, however, turns out to have some significant downsides.Intel is the world\u2019s biggest semiconductor company because when Mr. Grove was in charge, it dominated the personal computer industry and was an important player in the associated business in computer servers.Today, the PC market is shrinking, hurting Intel\u2019s profits. The server-chip industry is still strong, thanks to the rise of cloud computing at companies like Facebook and Google. Cloud companies engineer server chips in ways that make very powerful and flexible systems used by millions of people.But Intel missed joining a number of other markets that did not look like the PC business, particularly smartphones. It is scrambling for a place in sensors (or what is called the internet of things), wireless networking, autonomous vehicles and other hot areas, as computing spreads from traditional computers to nearly every machine.\u201cThe mistake was, when you grow with great leadership and great success, your paranoia is focused on the one thing that is delivering that,\u201d Brian Krzanich, Intel\u2019s current chief executive, said in an interview.From PC-dominated computing, he said, we are now \u201cwhere computing is constantly shifting.\u201d Mr. Krzanich says he is still a strong believer in paranoia, but he must turn that vigilant anxiety in a lot of directions at once. Cloud computing may be Intel\u2019s core, but Mr. Krzanich has to feed it from chips in many markets.The effect of those changes will be seen this week as Intel holds its Developer Forum in San Francisco. The conference is where the hard-core geeks of computing gather to hear about what\u2019s coming in the realms of processing power, memory and other technology that enables the modern world.Giant tech trade shows like the International CES, held in Las Vegas every January, are focused on hot products. Developer events may be nerd-fests, but they say more about the technology world, and where a company hopes to be in two or three years.Shifting gears for the giant chip company is no easy task. \u201cIntel has four main business lines \u2014 PCs, mobile, internet of things and servers \u2014 and it\u2019s hitting on one of them,\u201d said Patrick Gelsinger, a longtime Intel executive who is now chief executive of the software company VMware. The factories where Intel builds chips \u201cnow cost $10 billion, at least,\u201d each to set up, he said, \u201cand the competition is catching up.\u201dIn April, Intel announced it was cutting its work force by 12,000 people, about 11 percent of workers. About a quarter of the executives who report to Mr. Krzanich come from other companies, a big deal at a place where leaders rise through the ranks over decades.In his speech, Mr. Krzanich may stay away from talking about wearable devices. Last month, Intel withdrew a health-monitoring watch that had some nice capabilities but sometimes burned its wearers\u2019 skin. Even so, Mr. Krzanich said, the heart-monitoring capabilities of that watch will find their way into a device Intel plans to make with the athletics brand New Balance.The part he is looking forward to, Mr. Krzanich said, is a one-hour question-and-answer session with 200 elite developers. \u201cIt\u2019s a much broader group\u201d than even a couple of years ago, he said. \u201cPeople writing for machine learning and A.I., networking chips, how virtual reality feeds into PCs.\u201d Even in decline, PC chips still make up half of Intel\u2019s revenue.If these things catch on, Intel will sell more chips to those businesses and create new demand for cloud computing, because most devices are now connected to the cloud.Even so, another pillar of the Intel mythology, the unchanging nature of Moore\u2019s Law, is getting revised. Named for the Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, it states that a chip\u2019s power doubles every 18 to 24 months without a rise in costs. Mr. Grove\u2019s paranoia championed and fed on Moore\u2019s Law, as Intel strove to achieve profit from that computing cadence.Silicon Valley treats Moore\u2019s Law as if it is immutable, and with even more reverence than it does paranoia. But it was not a scientific law; it was always an observation about the behavior of a market for computers and software, which paid off at a rate to justify increasing investment in making chips.That is why Intel is in the wireless and networking fields, and is working on a new kind of three-dimensional memory chip, which Mr. Krzanich said would be out at the end of this year, that can speed performance of big-data-type calculations sevenfold.There would be a historical precedent to that shift. Years ago, Intel\u2019s main business was in memory chips, a market that collapsed three decades ago, leading the company to move toward making number-crunching processors for PCs. That shift, which arguably saved the company, was the lesson that led to Mr. Grove\u2019s paranoia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Ailes and Cosby, a Moment for More Women to Speak Up", "Date": "2016-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the fall of 1991, an obscure law professor named Anita Hill pushed the issue of sexual harassment into the public consciousness when she accused her former boss, the Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, of having repeatedly made lewd overtures toward her.But the episode sent a mixed message, in the view of many discrimination experts. While it raised awareness about a corrosive workplace behavior, the intense backlash against Ms. Hill, not least from members of the United States Senate, suggested that women faced great obstacles in redressing such abuses. (Mr. Thomas denied the allegations.)Nearly 25 years later, after a string of sexual harassment allegations that led to the ouster of Roger Ailes, the former chairman of Fox News, and a cascade of sexual assault accusations against the comedian Bill Cosby, some of those experts believe we may be approaching another Anita Hill moment.The Ailes and Cosby cases, they say, could be influential among women across the work force not just because of the intrinsic power of these examples, but because they come at a moment of empowerment for women in their struggle for equality. And when women\u2019s assertiveness produces dramatic results like the resignation of Mr. Ailes, it can inspire more women to follow the same path.\u201cWhen Anita Hill came out against Clarence Thomas, she got nothing and Clarence Thomas got life tenure,\u201d said Linda Hirshman, a Supreme Court biographer and former women\u2019s studies professor. \u201cIf anything would make the idea of women coming forward into a real threat, it would be the wicked confluence of everybody\u2019s dad, Bill Cosby, and Roger Ailes, the scariest man in the world \u2014 the fact that those two are going down.\u201dStill, workplace advocates caution that a greater sense of power, and even high-profile legal victories, will not necessarily lead to a significant increase in the number of women who take formal action. They note studies indicating that the great majority of sexual harassment incidents at work still go unreported.That sentiment was echoed by Carol Costello, a CNN anchor who, in a segment that aired last week, said that she had been sexually harassed when she was younger. Ms. Costello said she was inspired by the Ailes and Cosby cases to step forward, and thought it was important \u201cto add my voice to the cause,\u201d but was skeptical about whether it would lead to systemic change.\u201cI still think that there are consequences for women who come forward vocally or file lawsuits,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cA part of me still thinks that things haven\u2019t changed all that much.\u201dThe number of women filing sexual harassment charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission did increase significantly in the years after Ms. Hill came forward. But the impact of her testimony on that increase was somewhat muddied by a 1991 law that gave people alleging employment discrimination the right to a jury trial and allowed for additional monetary awards.Widely publicized cases appear to have played a role in prompting others to come forward in a variety of narrower contexts as well.A similar pattern appears to have played out in the banking industry. After the equal employment commission joined a prominent discrimination case against Morgan Stanley in 2001, the agency saw an uptick in sex discrimination charges from inside financial firms.The advertising industry has had its own increase in women speaking out. In March, the chief executive of the storied agency J. Walter Thompson resigned after a female employee filed a lawsuit accusing him of racist and sexist behavior. Within weeks, a number of top female executives had come forward to publicly describe their own experiences with sexism in the industry.The matter involving Gretchen Carlson, the former Fox anchor who filed a sexual harassment and retaliation lawsuit against Mr. Ailes last month, appears to be having a similar effect, beginning with at least two women who breached settlement agreements to describe their own experiences at the network.Kamee Verdrager, a lawyer, is pursuing her own yearslong legal battle over allegations of discrimination against a former employer, the law firm Mintz Levin, which stripped her of two years\u2019 seniority after she returned from maternity leave, and subsequently fired her. (Mintz Levin denies the allegations of discrimination but doesn\u2019t dispute these facts.) She said that prior examples of women speaking out could provide an enormous psychological boost for others contemplating their own action.In Ms. Verdrager\u2019s case, reading a book about women\u2019s struggles to succeed in the legal profession, which included numerous interviews with women who had faced discrimination, helped persuade her to file her complaint. \u201cThat book changed my life,\u201d she said. \u201cThe takeaway was that this is not unique to me. It\u2019s epidemic.\u201dBut the same connectedness that can provide support for victims can also work against them; some plaintiff\u2019s lawyers argue that the risks of speaking out have actually increased over time. Three decades ago, a court filing would have been extremely difficult for a prospective employer to uncover. Today, said Linda D. Friedman, a prominent employment lawyer who has brought many cases against Wall Street firms, the \u201ctroublemaker\u201d charge is likely to dog plaintiffs their entire lives.\u201cAny H.R. person in the country can do a Google search and come up with a federal complaint before deciding whether to hire a person,\u201d she said.To the extent that a high-profile case like Ms. Carlson\u2019s may encourage more survivors of harassment to come forward, many advocates say, it is more likely to happen indirectly, by first persuading employers to take discrimination and harassment claims more seriously. Only after most employees believe they can speak up without risking their careers, a development that many plaintiff\u2019s lawyers doubt is imminent, will they do so in substantially larger numbers.Still, if the fallout from the accusations against Mr. Cosby and Mr. Ailes is any indication, an increasing number of women may be concluding that speaking up is more likely than before to result in punishment for the alleged perpetrator rather than the accuser.Ms. Hill, now a professor at Brandeis University, is cautiously optimistic, though she worries that the $40 million payment Mr. Ailes reportedly received to leave Fox News could detract from the lesson of the case.\u201cThe fact the company is now not only talking to the women\u201d who have said they experienced harassment, \u201cbut also talking about whether others were enablers, that\u2019s important,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen who experienced harassment in their own workplace may see this as a possible outcome.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Aetna to Pull Back From Public Health Care Exchanges", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In a blow to President Obama\u2019s health care law, Aetna, one of the nation\u2019s major insurers, said Monday that it would sharply reduce its participation in the law\u2019s public marketplaces next year.Aetna said it would no longer offer individual insurance products on the exchanges in about two-thirds of the 778 counties where it now provides such coverage. The company will maintain a presence on exchanges in Delaware, Iowa, Nebraska and Virginia, it said.The exchanges are a centerpiece of the Affordable Care Act: the only place where consumers can obtain subsidies to buy health insurance, which most Americans are required to have under the 2010 law. About 11 million consumers have coverage through the marketplaces, and about 85 percent of them receive subsidies in the form of tax credits.Mark T. Bertolini, the chairman and chief executive of Aetna, said the company was responding to financial losses: \u201ca second-quarter pretax loss of $200 million and total pretax losses of more than $430 million since January 2014 in our individual products.\u201d\u201cAs a strong supporter of public exchanges as a means to meet the needs of the uninsured, we regret having to make this decision,\u201d Mr. Bertolini said. But, he added, the company cannot provide affordable, high-quality plans through the exchanges without a larger number of healthy people to help offset the costs of coverage for less healthy consumers.\u201cIndividuals in need of high-cost care\u201d account for a disproportionate share of the enrollment in Aetna\u2019s marketplace plans, and the federal government does not adequately adjust its payments to account for these costs, he said.Kevin J. Counihan, the chief executive of the federal insurance exchange, said the marketplace would remain strong and vibrant despite Aetna\u2019s decision.\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that companies are adapting at different rates to a market where they compete for business on cost and quality, rather than by denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions,\u201d Mr. Counihan said Monday.In a conference call with securities analysts in April, Mr. Bertolini said that Aetna had 911,000 members with individual coverage through the exchanges and added, \u201cWe see this as a good investment.\u201dSenator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, said she saw a possible connection between the antitrust case against Aetna and its decision to reconsider participating in the exchanges.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Homeless Find Refuge in Forests, \u2018Anger Is Palpable\u2019 in Nearby Towns", "Date": "2016-08-21", "News": "Supported byNEDERLAND, Colo. \u2014 Gerald Babbitt lives in these woods, in a pop-up trailer on cinder blocks that he bought for $250. His toilet is a bucket, and when he and his wife need to refill their water jugs, they drive their creaky green Jeep a mile down the mountain and into town. Most people are kind, but the other day someone called them \u201chomeless vagrant beggars,\u201d Mr. Babbitt said.\u201cYes, we\u2019re homeless,\u201d he said, sitting in the shade of his camper here in the Arapaho National Forest. \u201cNo, we\u2019re not vagrants. No, we\u2019re not beggars. We just barely are making it. What you see is by the grace of God.\u201dTo millions of adventurers and campers, America\u2019s national forests are a boundless backyard for hiking trips, rafting, hunting and mountain biking. But for thousands of homeless people and hard-up wanderers, they have become a retreat of last resort.Some residents have begun taking photographs of hitchhikers or videotaping confrontations with homeless people camping in the woods and posting them online, including on a private Facebook page created recently called Peak to Peak Forest Watch. Some say the campers have cursed at them for driving past without picking them up, or yelled at them while they were cycling or hiking. They say they no longer feel comfortable in some parts of the woods.But as a homeless man named Julian, 30, hiked down from the hills and into Nederland one rainy afternoon, guitar and knapsack slung on his back, he said a passing driver yelled at him to get out of town. He said he, too, felt uncomfortable and was heading toward Estes Park, Colo., then on to Oregon. He did not give his last name because he said he did not want friends and family reading that he was homeless.Mr. Wendlandt serves lunch and hands out socks to needy campers every Thursday. But he has stopped provisioning people with blankets and sleeping bags, worried that what seemed like compassion could be exacerbating a problem.One smoldering cigarette or lightning strike can ignite an entire hillside in the parched, fuel-filled forests across the West, and officials say the campfire galloped away and burned 600 acres of canyons and forests around Nederland. It destroyed eight homes, including that of a fire captain.The two men who started the campfire, Jimmy Suggs and Zackary Kuykendall, were arrested and charged with fourth-degree arson. The day before their arrest on July 10, the two men and a female companion \u2014 who was not criminally charged \u2014 happened across a reporter for The Boulder Daily Camera who was interviewing evacuees from the still-burning fire.Citing the fire danger, some residents have asked the Forest Service to do what many cities have done in cracking down on the homeless: impose tighter rules on camping, or ban it in parts of the woods that have attracted the most people.The Forest Service says it is working with thin law enforcement resources. One officer is assigned to Boulder County, which encompasses Nederland and the Roosevelt and Arapaho National Forests, which dominate the western part of the county. The service is spending more and more of its budget fighting wildfires, and has pared back on filling some law enforcement posts, said Chris Boehm, the agency\u2019s acting deputy director for law enforcement and investigations.\u201cThere may be some regions where we have one officer assigned to an entire forest or area,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what we want, but fires are expensive.\u201dFor years, people searching for solitude or without better options have retreated to live in the woods, in buses, vans, tents or other improvised shelters, their numbers swelling every summer and dwindling when the snow comes. But officials say public lands researchers are just beginning to study who lives there, and why.A 2015 survey of 290 law enforcement officers for the Forest Service found that officers in the Rocky Mountain West and Southwest encountered long-term campers most often. About half of the officers said the number of these long-term campers was on the rise, and only 2 percent said it had declined. (The rest said the number had either largely held steady or fluctuated.)Lee Cerveny, one of the researchers who conducted the survey, said it was unclear how many people might be living on public lands at any given time.\u201cWhat is happening, and why are we seeing more people living in the forests?\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet.\u201dNational parks place strict limits on camping, but in national forests and open spaces managed by the Bureau of Land Management, people can pitch tents just about anywhere camping is not prohibited. Many forests allow camping for only two weeks at a time. In 2015, the Forest Service handled 1,014 episodes related to violations of those rules.Around Nederland, crime reports, medical emergencies, unattended fires and other calls for help and extra patrols have soared at three Forest Service areas popular with homeless campers. The Boulder County Sheriff\u2019s Office was called there 388 times last year, up from 213 in 2013, and officials attribute some of the rise to Colorado\u2019s reputation as a mecca for legal marijuana, and Nederland\u2019s embrace of retail marijuana dispensaries.Rick Dirr, the Nederland fire chief, said his largely volunteer firefighters no longer answer nighttime calls in the woods without a marshal or sheriff\u2019s officer as backup. He said he has faced down one camper who carried a butcher knife, and searched the woods for another man who had attacked his girlfriend. There was the boy who swallowed a heroin baggie, he recalled, and a man who was hit in the head with a shovel.Others just do not understand how the forest works, he said. He responded to a report of an illegal fire to find a teenage boy and his 8-year-old sister alone at their campsite, bags of garbage everywhere. They and their parents had been living out of their car, and the father asked Chief Dirr when someone would come by for garbage pickup.\u201cWe still don\u2019t have a solution,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are the things going on unseen in the woods.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside Facebook\u2019s (Totally Insane, Unintentionally Gigantic, Hyperpartisan) Political-Media Machine", "Date": "2016-08-24", "News": "FeatureHow a strange new class of media outlet has arisen to take over our news feeds.Supported byAnd then: A family member who loves politics asking, \u201cIs this really who we want to be president?\u201d A co-worker, whom you\u2019ve never heard talk about politics, asking the same about a different candidate. A story about Donald Trump that \u201cjust can\u2019t be true\u201d in a figurative sense. A story about Donald Trump that \u201cjust can\u2019t be true\u201d in a literal sense. A video of Bernie Sanders speaking, overlaid with text, shared from a source you\u2019ve never seen before, viewed 15 million times. An article questioning Hillary Clinton\u2019s honesty; a headline questioning Donald Trump\u2019s sanity. A few shares that go a bit too far: headlines you would never pass along yourself but that you might tap, read and probably not forget.Maybe you\u2019ve noticed your feed becoming bluer; maybe you\u2019ve felt it becoming redder. Either way, in the last year, it has almost certainly become more intense. You\u2019ve seen a lot of media sources you don\u2019t recognize and a lot of posts bearing no memorable brand at all. You\u2019ve seen politicians and celebrities and corporations weigh in directly; you\u2019ve probably seen posts from the candidates themselves. You\u2019ve seen people you\u2019re close to and people you\u2019re not, with increasing levels of urgency, declare it is now time to speak up, to take a stand, to set aside allegiances or hangups or political correctness or hate.The Facebook product, to users in 2016, is familiar yet subtly expansive. Its algorithms have their pick of text, photos and video produced and posted by established media organizations large and small, local and national, openly partisan or nominally unbiased. But there\u2019s also a new and distinctive sort of operation that has become hard to miss: political news and advocacy pages made specifically for Facebook, uniquely positioned and cleverly engineered to reach audiences exclusively in the context of the news feed. These are news sources that essentially do not exist outside of Facebook, and you\u2019ve probably never heard of them. They have names like Occupy Democrats; The Angry Patriot; US Chronicle; Addicting Info; RightAlerts; Being Liberal; Opposing Views; Fed-Up Americans; American News; and hundreds more. Some of these pages have millions of followers; many have hundreds of thousands.Using a tool called CrowdTangle, which tracks engagement for Facebook pages across the network, you can see which pages are most shared, liked and commented on, and which pages dominate the conversation around election topics. Using this data, I was able to speak to a wide array of the activists and entrepreneurs, advocates and opportunists, reporters and hobbyists who together make up 2016\u2019s most disruptive, and least understood, force in media.Individually, these pages have meaningful audiences, but cumulatively, their audience is gigantic: tens of millions of people. On Facebook, they rival the reach of their better-funded counterparts in the political media, whether corporate giants like CNN or The New York Times, or openly ideological web operations like Breitbart or Mic. And unlike traditional media organizations, which have spent years trying to figure out how to lure readers out of the Facebook ecosystem and onto their sites, these new publishers are happy to live inside the world that Facebook has created. Their pages are accommodated but not actively courted by the company and are not a major part of its public messaging about media. But they are, perhaps, the purest expression of Facebook\u2019s design and of the incentives coded into its algorithm \u2014 a system that has already reshaped the web and has now inherited, for better or for worse, a great deal of America\u2019s political discourse.Occupy got him on Facebook, but it was the 2012 election that showed him its potential. As he saw it, that election was defined by social media. He mentioned a set of political memes that now feel generationally distant: Clint Eastwood\u2019s empty chair at the 2012 Republican National Convention and Mitt Romney\u2019s debate gaffe about \u201cbinders full of women.\u201d He thought it was a bit silly, but he saw in these viral moments a language in which activists like him could spread their message.This year, political content has become more popular all across the platform: on homegrown Facebook pages, through media companies with a growing Facebook presence and through the sharing habits of users in general. But truly Facebook-native political pages have begun to create and refine a new approach to political news: cherry-picking and reconstituting the most effective tactics and tropes from activism, advocacy and journalism into a potent new mixture. This strange new class of media organization slots seamlessly into the news feed and is especially notable in what it asks, or doesn\u2019t ask, of its readers. The point is not to get them to click on more stories or to engage further with a brand. The point is to get them to share the post that\u2019s right in front of them. Everything else is secondary.While web publishers have struggled to figure out how to take advantage of Facebook\u2019s audience, these pages have thrived. Unburdened of any allegiance to old forms of news media and the practice, or performance, of any sort of ideological balance, native Facebook page publishers have a freedom that more traditional publishers don\u2019t: to engage with Facebook purely on its terms. These are professional Facebook users straining to build media companies, in other words, not the other way around.From a user\u2019s point of view, every share, like or comment is both an act of speech and an accretive piece of a public identity. Maybe some people want to be identified among their networks as news junkies, news curators or as some sort of objective and well-informed reader. Many more people simply want to share specific beliefs, to tell people what they think or, just as important, what they don\u2019t. A newspaper-style story or a dry, matter-of-fact headline is adequate for this purpose. But even better is a headline, or meme, that skips straight to an ideological conclusion or rebuts an argument.Rafael Rivero is an acquaintance of Provost\u2019s who, with his twin brother, Omar, runs a page called Occupy Democrats, which passed three million followers in June. This accelerating growth is attributed by Rivero, and by nearly every left-leaning page operator I spoke with, not just to interest in the election but especially to one campaign in particular: \u201cBernie Sanders is the Facebook candidate,\u201d Rivero says. The rise of Occupy Democrats essentially mirrored the rise of Sanders\u2019s primary run. On his page, Rivero started quoting text from Sanders\u2019s frequent email blasts, turning them into Facebook-ready memes with a consistent aesthetic: colors that pop, yellow on black. Rivero says that it\u2019s clear what his audience wants. \u201cI\u2019ve probably made 10,000 graphics, and it\u2019s like running 10,000 focus groups,\u201d he said. (Clinton was and is, of course, widely discussed by Facebook users: According to the company, in the last month 40.8 million people \u201cgenerated interactions\u201d around the candidate. But Rivero says that in the especially engaged, largely oppositional left-wing-page ecosystem, Clinton\u2019s message and cautious brand didn\u2019t carry.)Because the Sanders campaign has come to an end, these sites have been left in a peculiar position, having lost their unifying figure as well as their largest source of engagement. Audiences grow quickly on Facebook but can disappear even more quickly; in the case of left-leaning pages, many had accumulated followings not just by speaking to Sanders supporters but also by being intensely critical, and often utterly dismissive, of Clinton.\u201cIt\u2019s like a meme war,\u201d Rivero says, \u201cand politics is being won and lost on social media.\u201dThis was, for most news organizations, a boon. The flood of visitors aligned with two core goals of most media companies: to reach people and to make money. But as Facebook\u2019s growth continued, its influence was intensified by broader trends in internet use, primarily the use of smartphones, on which Facebook became more deeply enmeshed with users\u2019 daily routines. Soon, it became clear that Facebook wasn\u2019t just a source of readership; it was, increasingly, where readers lived.Facebook, from a publisher\u2019s perspective, had seized the web\u2019s means of distribution by popular demand. A new reality set in, as a social-media network became an intermediary between publishers and their audiences. For media companies, the ability to reach an audience is fundamentally altered, made greater in some ways and in others more challenging. For a dedicated Facebook user, a vast array of sources, spanning multiple media and industries, is now processed through the same interface and sorting mechanism, alongside updates from friends, family, brands and celebrities.From the start, some publishers cautiously regarded Facebook as a resource to be used only to the extent that it supported their existing businesses, wary of giving away more than they might get back. Others embraced it more fully, entering into formal partnerships for revenue sharing and video production, as The New York Times has done. Some new-media start-ups, most notably BuzzFeed, have pursued a comprehensively Facebook-centric production-and-distribution strategy. All have eventually run up against the same reality: A company that can claim nearly every internet-using adult as a user is less a partner than a context \u2014 a self-contained marketplace to which you have been granted access but which functions according to rules and incentives that you cannot control.The news feed is designed, in Facebook\u2019s public messaging, to \u201cshow people the stories most relevant to them\u201d and ranks stories \u201cso that what\u2019s most important to each person shows up highest in their news feeds.\u201d It is a framework built around personal connections and sharing, where value is both expressed and conferred through the concept of engagement. Of course, engagement, in one form or another, is what media businesses have always sought, and provocation has always sold news. But now the incentives are literalized in buttons and written into software.Readers who clicked through to the story were led to an external website, called Make America Great Today, where they were presented with a brief write-up blended almost seamlessly into a solid wall of fleshy ads. Khan, the story said \u2014 between ads for \u201c(1) Odd Trick to \u2018Kill\u2019 Herpes Virus for Good\u201d and \u201c22 Tank Tops That Aren\u2019t Covering Anything\u201d \u2014 is an agent of the Muslim Brotherhood and a \u201cpromoter of Islamic Shariah law.\u201d His late son, the story suggests, could have been a \u201cMuslim martyr\u201d working as a double agent. A credit link beneath the story led to a similar-looking site called Conservative Post, from which the story\u2019s text was pulled verbatim. Conservative Post had apparently sourced its story from a longer post on a right-wing site called Shoebat.com.Within 24 hours, the post was shared more than 3,500 times, collecting a further 3,000 reactions \u2014 thumbs-up likes, frowning emoji, angry emoji \u2014 as well as 850 comments, many lengthy and virtually all impassioned. A modest success. Each day, according to Facebook\u2019s analytics, posts from the Make America Great page are seen by 600,000 to 1.7 million people. In July, articles posted to the page, which has about 450,000 followers, were shared, commented on or liked more than four million times, edging out, for example, the Facebook page of USA Today.Nicoloff\u2019s business model is not dissimilar from the way most publishers use Facebook: build a big following, post links to articles on an outside website covered in ads and then hope the math works out in your favor. For many, it doesn\u2019t: Content is expensive, traffic is unpredictable and website ads are both cheap and alienating to readers. But as with most of these Facebook-native pages, Nicoloff\u2019s content costs comparatively little, and the sheer level of interest in Trump and in the type of inflammatory populist rhetoric he embraces has helped tip Nicoloff\u2019s system of advertising arbitrage into serious profitability. In July, visitors arriving to Nicoloff\u2019s website produced a little more than $30,000 in revenue. His costs, he said, total around $8,000, partly split between website hosting fees and advertising buys on Facebook itself.Terry Littlepage, an internet marketer based in Las Cruces, N.M., has taken this model even further. He runs a collection of about 50 politically themed Facebook pages with names like The American Patriot and My Favorite Gun, which push visitors to a half-dozen external websites, stocked with content aggregated by a team of freelancers. He estimates that he spends about a thousand dollars a day advertising his pages on Facebook; as a result, they have more than 10 million followers. In a good month, Littlepage\u2019s properties bring in $60,000.Nicoloff and Littlepage say that Trump has been good for business, but each admits to some discomfort. Nicoloff, a conservative, says that there were other candidates he preferred during the Republican primaries but that he had come around to the nominee. Littlepage is also a recent convert. During the primaries, he was a Cruz supporter, and he even tried making some left-wing pages on Facebook but discovered that they just didn\u2019t make him as much money.In their angry, cascading comment threads, Make America Great\u2019s followers express no such ambivalence. Nearly every page operator I spoke to was astonished by the tone their commenters took, comparing them to things like torch-wielding mobs and sharks in a feeding frenzy. No doubt because of the page\u2019s name, some Trump supporters even mistake Nicoloff\u2019s page for an official organ of the campaign. Nicoloff says that he receives dozens of messages a day from Trump supporters, expecting or hoping to reach the man himself. Many, he says, are simply asking for money.A dozen or so of the sites are published in-house, but posts from the company\u2019s small team of writers are free to be shared among the entire network. The deal for a would-be Liberty Alliance member is this: You bring the name and the audience, and the company will build you a prefab site, furnish it with ads, help you fill it with content and keep a cut of the revenue. Coca told me the company brought in $12 million in revenue last year. (The company declined to share documentation further corroborating his claims about followers and revenue.)Because the pages are run independently, the editorial product is varied. But it is almost universally tuned to the cadences and styles that seem to work best on partisan Facebook. It also tracks closely to conservative Facebook media\u2019s big narratives, which, in turn, track with the Trump campaign\u2019s messaging: Hillary Clinton is a crook and possibly mentally unfit; ISIS is winning; Black Lives Matter is the real racist movement; Donald Trump alone can save us; the system \u2014 all of it \u2014 is rigged. Whether the Liberty Alliance succeeds or fails will depend, at least in part, on Facebook\u2019s algorithm. Systemic changes to the ecosystem arrive through algorithmic adjustments, and the company recently adjusted the news feed to \u201cfurther reduce clickbait headlines.\u201dFor now, the network hums along, mostly beneath the surface. A post from a Liberty Alliance page might find its way in front of a left-leaning user who might disagree with it or find it offensive, and who might choose to engage with the friend who posted it directly. But otherwise, such news exists primarily within the feeds of the already converted, its authorship obscured, its provenance unclear, its veracity questionable. It\u2019s an environment that\u2019s at best indifferent and at worst hostile to traditional media brands; but for this new breed of page operator, it\u2019s mostly upside. In front of largely hidden and utterly sympathetic audiences, incredible narratives can take shape, before emerging, mostly formed, into the national discourse.Before Hannity signed off, he posed a question: \u201cSo, does that mean anything?\u201d It\u2019s a version of the question that everyone wants to answer about Facebook and politics, which is whether the site\u2019s churning political warfare is actually changing minds \u2014 or, for that matter, beginning to change the political discourse as a whole. How much of what happens on the platform is a reflection of a political mood and widely held beliefs, simply captured in a new medium, and how much of it might be created, or intensified, by the environment it provides? What is Facebook doing to our politics?Appropriately, the answer to this question can be chosen and shared on Facebook in whichever way you prefer. You might share this story from The New York Times Magazine, wondering aloud to your friends whether our democracy has been fundamentally altered by this publishing-and-advertising platform of unprecedented scale. Or you might just relax and find some memes to share from one of countless pages that will let you air your political id. But for the page operators, the question is irrelevant to the task at hand. Facebook\u2019s primacy is a foregone conclusion, and the question of Facebook\u2019s relationship to political discourse is absurd \u2014 they\u2019re one and the same. As Rafael Rivero put it to me, \u201cFacebook is where it\u2019s all happening.\u201dJohn Herrman is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Milwaukee\u2019s Divide Runs Right Through Me", "Date": "2016-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEssayIn Milwaukee, I lived two lives. On the East Side was the liberal Catholic school I attended for nine years; on the North Side was everything else.On the North Side that shaped me, there was a resentment, a reflexive skepticism that it took me awhile to understand as a son of Nigerian immigrants. But with experience, I got it. The only white people I saw in my neighborhood staffed the library. Parents tried to teach their children, in the most visceral ways they could imagine, to stay out of trouble.Like most people, many black parents on the North Side passed these feelings to their children.The narrative was different on the East Side. There I saw a practiced obliviousness among parents and children that I also did not fully understand. There we hoped to be doctors and lawyers, or in my case, a journalist.On many days, I felt as if I were being shuttled between two different cities, two different worlds. The cloistered shell of liberalism to the east and the infectious anger of the streets to the north never intersected, never touched.In the East, the future was expected. It was a birthright, a source of frenetic energy.In the North, reckoning was expected. It was inevitable, a source of pride and loathing.No matter your defenses, it would surely come, and punish the hopes that lie outside your black body.Memories of my East Side life are soft, a flood of inconsequential smiles and vague encouragements offered by people living protected lives. I attended school with kids too young to hear about what I had already experienced.Memories of my North Side life are sharp, like the screwdriver in my back when I wouldn\u2019t let a boy \u201cborrow\u201d my bike. Like my mother\u2019s words after the thief\u2019s father pretended to call for him, then slammed the door because his son couldn\u2019t be bothered.My North Side memories are also hot, like the summer, when the balance of power tilts irrevocably toward the ones who spend the most time in the streets, with the largest alliances. When those boys became men, they\u2019d become crews. They\u2019d have run-ins with the ones a few blocks over, and someone might die for the pride that began here.Life on the North Side was what mattered TODAY. It was my brother and I walking down the middle of a vacant street with baseball bats, looking for the one who beat up our little brother because he won a basketball game, and that was important TODAY. It was preteen girls begging teenage boys to come through the side door of some garage, because those teenagers were so buff, and they could finally have him, and he could take them, because that\u2019s what mattered TODAY.It was when the police were called and your friend, who had a robber\u2019s gun in his mouth, had his complaint dismissed because he was probably a drug dealer, and then you sat at the door holding knives all night to protect his family. It\u2019s when the police tore apart an entire car in a search, because the passengers were dancing, leaving you on the curb, as cars drove by and people gawked \u2014 one more piece of your pride TODAY.My parents came from Nigeria to Milwaukee in 1985. They saw a land of opportunity. They had gone to college in Nigeria. Their families had always been allowed to pursue their dreams. Their hard work had always paid off.And mine did, too. I\u2019m 29 years old. I am an editor for The New York Times.Does that make me more or less of a credible voice? In this national discussion about how we equalize opportunity in this post-Jim Crow era, in all of the ways that matter right now, am I even black? Or are these questions just survivor\u2019s guilt? Maybe it\u2019s just pitiful angst that has no answer and doesn\u2019t need any.Or maybe the angst can lead to answers.Before I started writing this essay, I spoke to Mandela Barnes, a state legislator who represents a district in Northwest Milwaukee, about the city and the violence. I imagined a teenager on the North Side, politically active, moderate in many ways, dedicated to helping our people. Someone maybe like me, trying to figure out how to do something that would address all the injustice.Considering the minimal loss of life from the week\u2019s unrest, and the relatively contained property damage, what do you say to a kid who says \u201cthis worked, attention is now being paid to our situation, and my friends in other cities should do the same thing?\u201dI asked him: How can you convince that teenager to take a different path when his or her friends are riding a pipeline to prison?\u201cAs frustrating as things can be, you never want to destroy your own,\u201d Mr. Barnes said. \u201cLiterally burning up your own home is not the route. There are other ways to make your voice heard.\u201dHonestly, I have my doubts. They are new, and I am nearly consumed by them. Maybe that\u2019s just the North Side of me.

The Spice Girls played this trick most baldly, naming and dressing members after a singular trait \u2014 Baby, Scary, Sporty, Posh and Ginger. But supporting a favorite bandmate can easily degrade into trashing a least favorite.

{"Headline": "Attack at University in Kabul Shatters a Sense of Freedom", "Date": "2016-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBeyond providing a quality education, the school offered a glimpse of a carefree life away from the unpredictable violence that afflicted the rest of the capital. Behind layers of security, students could play basketball at the gym, compete in debate tournaments or just have an uninterrupted conversation over coffee.Men with Kalashnikov rifles and grenades first gunned down a guard at the adjoining school for the blind. One drove a car packed with explosives into the American University\u2019s wall, blowing a gap through it. Two more militants dashed onto campus, where hundreds of students were taking evening classes. The attackers methodically stalked the men and women trapped inside, fighting off the Afghan security forces for nearly 10 hours in a terrifying overnight siege.On Thursday morning, at least 13 lay dead: seven students, three police officers, two university guards and the night guard at the neighboring school for the blind. Abdul Baseer Mujahid, a spokesman for the Kabul police, said that more than 30 others were hurt in the attack; another estimate, from the Health Ministry, said 16 had been killed and 53 wounded.The attack was unmistakably a blow to young Afghans who had chosen to defy the migrant exodus away from the country\u2019s war and instead pursue their dreams in the difficult circumstances at home.From its start in 2006, the American University drew the sons and daughters of prominent Afghan families. But many students of more humble backgrounds won scholarships, and they were among the school\u2019s most promising.On Thursday, President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack as a barbaric act of enmity against progress. Out of safety concerns, the university remained closed.All three of the attackers were killed, their affiliation still unannounced by Thursday evening. But another statement from Mr. Ghani\u2019s office suggested that suspicion had fallen on the Haqqani wing of the Taliban, or some other Pakistan-based faction. Mr. Ghani called the Pakistani Army chief, Gen. Raheel Sharif, and \u201casked for serious and practical measures against the terrorists organizing the attack,\u201d the statement said.Through the night, family members of the people trapped on campus gathered outside a security cordon, hoping for news. Some students inside took to social media to ask for help, but they later fell silent \u2014 many of them desperate to avoid alerting the gunmen to their hiding places.Members of the Afghan Special Forces cut off the area\u2019s electricity and began evacuating hundreds of students, moving slowly to try to avoid civilian casualties, said Sediq Sediqqi, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry.Security officials said both of the infiltrating gunmen entered the Bayat classroom building just after 7 p.m., when about 160 students were in class in the building. One of the militants had stationed himself near the stairs on the first floor, while the second had moved up to target the classrooms on the second floor. Most of the student casualties were caused by the first militant, who shot those trying to flee.The militant on the first floor was killed around 1:30 a.m., officials said. The gunman on the second floor lobbed grenades at Special Forces troops for two more hours. The siege was declared over shortly before 5 a.m. on Thursday.Some of the people who had been trapped inside the university described a 10-hour ordeal, much of it spent waiting for death in complete darkness. They hid in gym lockers, or under classroom desks. Some jumped from upper floors, breaking their legs, while others managed to scale the walls of the compound.Abdullah Frotan, a student who was trapped until the very end of the siege, said he had been in a third-floor classroom when the initial explosion occurred. About 10 students in his class tried to make it to the first floor to escape, but the gunmen were already inside the building, so they rushed back to the third floor and tried to hide in a classroom.\u201cWe were lying like dead bodies on the ground in the rear of the class, and we put all the chairs in front of us, and we hid behind the chairs,\u201d Mr. Frotan said.Two of his classmates were wounded, one in the back and one in the leg, Mr. Frotan said. They held their hands over their mouths to stifle cries of pain that could alert the attackers.\u201cOne of our classmates did not come back with us to the third floor. He was killed; we learned this later,\u201d Mr. Frotan said.Muhammad Daud, 26, an economics student, said he had recited his final prayers hiding under the tables on a third-floor classroom. The attacker fired a few rounds in the dark, and then moved on to the next room.Mr. Daud agonized over whether to try to jump out a window. The gunman\u2019s sudden return to the classroom made the decision easier. \u201cWhen he started firing, I jumped and didn\u2019t think what would happen,\u201d he said.Alnaz Jamal, an 18-year-old scholarship student who was starting her first week of college after years of displacement in Pakistan, did not make it.Ms. Jamal, whom her family called Alina, had been attending a lecture on the second floor, and she was among those who jumped, said Omaid Sharifi, a cousin. When the family finally found her body at a morgue this morning, they saw she had also sustained bullet wounds.Her father, a street vendor, was in Pakistan to get Ms. Jamal\u2019s high school transcript and new clothes for her university journey.\u201cHer mother faints every 15 minutes,\u201d Mr. Sharifi said.Advertisement"}

Another is now living with the actor portraying the father. The stage manager took one, as did a hairdresser, and the parents of a publicist.\u201cI hadn\u2019t really discussed it with my husband, and we have a 6-year-old and an ancient Chihuahua, so it wasn\u2019t the best time,\u201d said Francesca Faridany, or Frankie, the actress who for the first year of the show\u2019s run played the teacher, Siobhan, and developed a fondness for Bubba, who was Puppy No. 8. \u201cBut I thought, \u2018Oh, my God, I want to take him.\u2019\u201d Bubba, a mixed-breed dog who arrived at the show from a shelter and stayed in the cast for about eight weeks because he remained small, now lives with Ms. Faridany and her family.This unusual puppy pipeline \u2014 generally from a breeder to the stage, and from the stage to a home \u2014 is nearing an end: The producers of \u201cCurious Incident\u201d have announced that they are closing the Broadway production on Sept. 4. But it has created an unusual group of dog-owning theater lovers who can identify their pets by number (reflecting when they appeared in the show), get together for playdates, exchange dog-sitting and have a Facebook group for photos; some even attended games played by the Curious Dogs, the show\u2019s Broadway Show League softball team.A few of the dogs had abbreviated theatrical careers (two exhibited stage fright and were replaced), while others had incidents (one vomited onstage). Bubba left after developing cherry eye, but then returned to reprise his role as an understudy. (On nights when Bubba performed but Ms. Faridany did not, the show sent a car to shuttle him to the theater.)At least two of the dogs have parlayed childhood success onstage into commercial work, while Puppy No. 12, Babs, seems to have an actor\u2019s self-regard. \u201cOne quirky thing she does is stare at herself \u2014 in any mirror, water, glass windows,\u201d said Sandy Rapp, the mother of a \u201cCurious\u201d publicist, who adopted that dog. \u201cWe attribute this to her having been a star.\u201dThe play, based on the best-selling 2003 novel by the British writer Mark Haddon, chronicles the quest by Christopher, a teenager with symptoms often associated with children on the autism spectrum, to solve a dog\u2019s murder. That dog, who appears onstage, dead, in the opening scene, is depicted by a prop that the live dogs are barred from seeing; the live puppy arrives late in the show.\u201cAnimals take you the way you are and ask for so little in return,\u201d said Allison Fedigan, whose husband is a production electrician on Broadway; the couple have a son on the autism spectrum, and adopted Puppy No. 10, Forrest, after hearing about the dogs from an electrician who worked on \u201cCurious Incident.\u201d \u201cFostering those relationships seems to be much easier for people on the spectrum.\u201dThe show, which began performances at Broadway\u2019s Ethel Barrymore Theater in September 2014, won the Tony Award for best new play last year; it has been playing in London since 2012, and touring productions begin next month in the United States and in January in Britain.Alex Sharp, who originated the role of Christopher (and won a Tony for his performance), decided while rehearsing for the Broadway opening that a puppy might respond to him better onstage if it knew him a bit, so he took the first puppy home. Mr. Sharp was not a dog person \u2014 his family moved constantly, and two rabbits were the extent of his childhood pet experience \u2014 so taking care of a puppy was a bit of a shock.\u201cLydia gave me a cage and puppy pads and food, and I was like, \u2018It\u2019s fine,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut it was running around throwing up on things, pooing, peeing, barking all night, running in circles hysterically excited, and sleeping for three hours.\u201dMr. Sharp worked with 13 puppies (\u201cthat was 13 heartbreaking moments when they would leave\u201d) and would take each home for a night or two when they first arrived at the show, and then later if their performances seemed to slacken. \u201cI would make a little bed next to mine and sleep with my hand on the puppy, and if my hand went off it would start crying,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was quite a lot, but it made a big difference to the performance onstage.\u201dOne puppy threw up during a scene \u2014 the actor playing Christopher\u2019s father used a sweatshirt to clean it up \u2014 and another nipped Mr. Sharp\u2019s face, forcing him to play the rest of the scene with his hoodie pressed against his chin to stop the bleeding. (Mary Birnbaum, a director who knew Ms. Faridany\u2019s husband, wound up adopting the biter, Puppy No. 6, who is a spaniel-poodle mix. \u201cHe was very poorly behaved in the show,\u201d she said, \u201cand one night he vomited onstage.\u201d But now, \u201cHe is wonderfully behaved and retains a bit of the actor\u2019s extroversion.\u201d)But mostly, Mr. Sharp said, the dogs were delightful \u2014 especially for audiences, and especially if the dog would yap or lick the actor\u2019s face. (\u201cThe secret was I\u2019d been sweating for hours, and they just liked the taste of the salt.\u201d) And the impact was clear.\u201cWhen the yellow lab tumbled out at the end of the show we both squealed and fell in love \u2014 along with everyone else in the audience, I\u2019m sure,\u201d said Hillary Reeves, who watched the show with her boyfriend. That couple adopted the opening-night puppy (No. 3, Jelly, a Labrador retriever) after hearing about the dog from a fellow alumna of Camp Broadway.Ms. DesRoche said that there had generally been a line of people in the theater world eager to adopt. \u201cIt\u2019s not difficult to find a home for an adorable blond puppy,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about adult pit bulls.\u201dChris Kurtz, a \u201cCurious\u201d deck electrician and video technician, introduced himself to Ms. DesRoche as soon as he heard that the dogs might be adoptable; he fostered Puppy No. 5, Charlie, for a week, commuting with him on the A train, before telling his thrilled kids that the dog would be coming home for good. Puppy No. 16, Lola, who loved the stage so much that she would jump into the gift box as soon as she heard her entrance music, went to Kim Shriver, who was working in the show\u2019s hair department when she met the dogs.Andrew Long, now playing Christopher\u2019s father, said: \u201cI have an 8-year-old daughter, and as soon as she got wind of the fact that they were being adopted when they got too big, it was just a battle of attrition \u2014 \u2018Can I have the next one?\u2019 I finally caved in the spring.\u201dOn the Tuesday of Simon\u2019s first performance, Ms. DesRoche brought him early to the theater to meet the cast; onstage, as most of the cast sat around the perimeter talking to acclimate him to the scene, Mr. Lea held a sort of dress rehearsal, using treats to lure the dog as he chased him around the stage, or lying on the floor and letting the dog crawl over his body.\u201cThe goal is having the dog come to me, and just being able to run around the stage and have it follow me around, but I change it up based on what the dog is doing \u2014 I have to read what the dog wants to do and work around that,\u201d Mr. Lea said. \u201cThe puppies do what puppies do.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Tech Firms Forced to Choose Market: Home or Everywhere Else", "Date": "2016-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 For teenagers who like to sing along with Ariana Grande and Flo Rida, Musical.ly is a must-have. The app that lets users lip-sync and dance in their own music videos boasts 100 million users and partners with pop stars like Ms. Grande and Meghan Trainor.It\u2019s not easy to tell Musical.ly is Chinese \u2014 and that\u2019s deliberate. To find success in America, its parent company has ignored China, its home market and a country with 700 million internet users.The reason is simple, says Alex Zhu, co-founder of Shanghai-based Musical.ly: China\u2019s internet is fundamentally different from the one used in much of the rest of the world.\u201cIt\u2019s still very difficult to get into China,\u201d said Mr. Zhu, who studied civil engineering at Zhejiang University in the eastern city of Hangzhou. \u201cIt\u2019s a closed environment, and you have to be quite different to compete in that market.\u201dFor China\u2019s web companies, the divide may have even more significant implications.It has penned in the country\u2019s biggest and most innovative internet companies. Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent have grown to be some of the world\u2019s largest internet companies, but they rely almost entirely on domestic businesses. Their ventures abroad have been mostly desultory, and prognostications that they will challenge American giants internationally have not materialized.For Chinese web start-ups like Musical.ly, the internet split has also forced them to choose \u2014 either create something that caters to China\u2019s digital population or focus on the rest of the globe.In many ways, the split is like 19th century railroads in the United States, when rails of different sizes hindered a train\u2019s ability to go from one place to another.\u201cThe barrier to entering the U.S. or China market is becoming higher and higher,\u201d said Kai-fu Lee, a venture investor from Taiwan and former head of Google China.In 2012, armed with a cash stockpile of several hundred million dollars, the world soccer star Lionel Messi as a spokesman and local ads like Bollywood-inspired commercials in India, Tencent began a push that executives said would be its best chance of breaking out of China. The effort flopped.Critics pointed to Tencent\u2019s lack of distinctive marketing, a record of censorship and surveillance in China and its late arrival to foreign markets. Yet the biggest problem was that outside of China, WeChat was just not the same. Within China, WeChat can be used to do almost everything, like pay bills, hail a taxi, book a doctor\u2019s appointment, share photos and chat. Yet its ability to do that is dependent on other Chinese internet services that are limited outside the country.That leaves WeChat outside China as an app that people mostly use to chat and share photos \u2014 not that different from WhatsApp and Messenger, which are both owned by Facebook. Baidu and Alibaba have apps that similarly offer a range of capabilities, yet are less useful outside China.The same problem hurts start-ups in China. Those companies start out accustomed to using Chinese internet sites and apps to market and enhance their business. But going abroad means a different world of services to master, such as a solid understanding of Facebook and Google\u2019s platforms and ads, not Baidu\u2019s and Tencent\u2019s.By contrast, Musical.ly chose the opposite approach and linked itself to the most popular social networks in the United States. If someone records an impressively coordinated dance or flawlessly lip-synced song, the person can put it up not just on the app, but also add it to Instagram, send it on WhatsApp or post it to Facebook. That has helped Musical.ly grow naturally to Europe, South America and Southeast Asia, Mr. Zhu said.\u201cThe thing about this young generation in the U.S. is, they\u2019re creative,\u201d said Mr. Zhu. \u201cThey\u2019ll say, \u2018Please follow me on Instagram or Snapchat.\u2019 If your app can attract some people in an age group and make them super excited to share, you will probably grow.\u201dFor Cheetah Mobile, a maker of smartphone utility apps based in Beijing whose users are mostly outside China, the solution was finding a steppingstone to the rest of the world. In early 2014, it opened an office in Taiwan, where use of Google and Facebook dominates. That helped it gain employees who intimately understood Facebook, YouTube and other major Western platforms that could be used for advertising.\u201cTaiwan served as a bridge for us across the Pacific to the United States,\u201d said Charles Fan, Cheetah\u2019s chief technology officer.Tencent, Alibaba and Baidu have all opened American offices, but they have mostly turned to investments and acquisitions to gain footholds overseas. Over the last two years, Alibaba has invested in emerging markets, including two online commerce companies, Paytm and Snapdeal, in India. It also spent $1 billion to acquire Lazada, an e-commerce site popular in Southeast Asia.Perhaps the greatest indication of Tencent\u2019s overseas ambitions was a deal that never happened. In 2014, with its global WeChat campaign faltering, it was preparing to start negotiations to bid for WhatsApp when Facebook swooped in, according to a senior Tencent executive who asked for anonymity in discussing corporate strategy.Tencent and Baidu declined to comment. An Alibaba spokeswoman referred to recent remarks by Alibaba\u2019s president, J. Michael Evans, in which he pointed to acquisitions as a way the company was attracting new consumers in developing markets. He also said Alibaba was focused on attracting more foreign businesses to sell on its markets in China.Mr. Lee said it might take a new technological jump for Chinese companies to get a chance at building a platform inside China and internationally. He said Chinese companies could prove competitive in emerging sectors like virtual reality, artificial intelligence and robotics.\u201cI think what might be surprising is, China will catch up rapidly,\u201d he said. \u201cPartly because of Chinese universities, partly because of returnees to China who form a portion of the top engineers in the world.\u201dMusical.ly is in many ways a product of the cultural exchange between the United States and China that Mr. Lee described. Mr. Zhu, 37, graduated from a Chinese university, but moved to the United States with the German software company SAP in 2010. He had the idea for the music app while riding the train from San Francisco to Mountain View, Calif., in a car full of high school students.\u201cHalf were listening to music and the other half were using their phone to take photos and add emojis, and they were passing them around,\u201d Mr. Zhu said. Then it hit him: combine the selfie and social media part with the music part and turn it into one product. In 2015, Mr. Zhu moved to Shanghai, where his co-founder has been based since Musical.ly\u2019s 2013 inception.Yet Musical.ly is unlikely to be the social network to link both sides of the Pacific. For the demographic the app is focusing on, it\u2019s far better to be outside its home market, Mr. Zhu said.\u201cTeenagers in the U.S. are a golden audience,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at China, the teenage culture doesn\u2019t exist \u2014 the teens are super busy in school studying for tests, so they don\u2019t have the time and luxury to play social media apps.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Trump. To complicate matters, Mr. Trump may well be the most media-savvy presidential candidate since John F. Kennedy.It\u2019s easy to speculate that back in the day an Edward R. Murrow might have taken out Mr. Trump just as he did Joseph McCarthy, but what if McCarthy had had access to Twitter, Facebook and all the other means of unfiltered communication directly to the public, as Mr. Trump has now?In defining the problem with McCarthy, Mr. Murrow might just as well have been referring to Mr. Trump when he alluded to a passage in Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d: \u201cThe actions of the junior senator from Wisconsin have caused alarm and dismay among our allies abroad, and given considerable comfort to our enemies. And whose fault is that? Not really his. He didn\u2019t create this situation of fear, he merely exploited it \u2014 and rather successfully. Cassius was right: \u2018The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves.\u2019 \u201dKudos to Jim Rutenberg for his thoughtful and pointed analysis of the challenges of covering someone like Mr. Trump objectively. And thank God for bona fide journalists perceptive enough to openly recognize and discuss the difficulties of doing so while negotiating the treacherous war zone that our political process has become. GREG JOSEPHSun City, Ariz.To the Editor:Your article conceals an unfortunate reality of much of the contemporary media and liberalism: a basic distrust of democracy. Through the process of democratic elections, a significant plurality of those voting in the Republican primaries selected Mr. Trump as their preferred candidate for president. This was democracy in action.If objective journalists truly believed in the fundamental principle of a democratic form of government, they would be respecting this choice and would be performing their job of objectively and fairly presenting the facts concerning both candidates and letting the voters decide. But as this article makes clear, many journalists cannot bring themselves to be fair, balanced and objective. Instead, they believe that they know better than the people, and are unwilling to provide just the facts and let the electorate decide.CHRISTOPHER HODGKINFriday Harbor, Wash.To the Editor:Journalists have bent over backward to seem \u201cbalanced\u201d at the expense of objective truth for far too long. As long as it comes out of a prominent politician\u2019s mouth, they report and repeat it as if it\u2019s a reasonable point of view, regardless of the evidence (or lack thereof). It gives credence to self-serving fabrications like \u201cwe don\u2019t know if humans are contributing to climate change\u201d and \u201cvoter fraud is a serious crisis.\u201dNow Donald Trump has raised the stakes even further. Don\u2019t legitimize his lying, ignorance, cruelty and recklessness just because he\u2019s one of two presidential candidates. Measure him against fact, evidence, precedent and basic human decency, and call it like it is.JUSTIN WARNERJackson Heights, QueensTo the Editor:The sheer volume of coverage of Donald Trump is completely out of proportion to the seriousness of his ideas or frankly to the newsworthy value of the stories written about him. Day in and day out The Times devotes at least one and often multiple front-page stories to Mr. Trump. Often there is not a single story about Hillary Clinton.Why are his tweets news, while her policy statements are not? It matters relatively little that the Trump articles are often critical. His latest outrageous remark is the story of the day \u2014 and the story of the next day is whether or not it was all that outrageous. One wonders whether The Times is simply trying to sell papers by printing flashy copy or is trying to inform the public about issues that actually matter to their lives.IRWIN SANDLERPhoenixTo the Editor:I do not think Jim Rutenberg need worry that we do not get enough negative coverage on Hillary Clinton. I have heard as much about her trust numbers, Benghazi and her supposedly egregious lies about emails to last a lifetime.Please stop thinking that Hillary Clinton is not being raked over the coals for her mistakes enough compared with Donald Trump.

This one walked almost entirely upright.With two maimed front legs, Pedals, an American black bear who displays remarkably good posture, manages to get around on his hind legs. His unusual condition has spawned coveted sightings and viral videos. \u201cPedals is my spirit animal,\u201d one person wrote on Facebook.But the wandering bear has also inspired a fierce debate, between those who would put him in a wildlife sanctuary and those who would leave him be.The fascination with the bipedal bear comes as New Jersey grapples with a large bear population, which has grown steadily since the 1980s. There are now an estimated 2,500 bears north of Interstate 80, and the state introduced a hunting season several years ago to manage the ursine population.While most bears roaming through the area are met with fear, or even indifference, the bipedal bear has provoked the opposite reaction, with both local residents and a worldwide internet audience becoming passionate, protective and, most of all, opinionated.Supporters also raised more than $25,000 to help pay for a new enclosure there. They commiserated on the Facebook page \u201cPedals the Injured Bipedal Bear.\u201d A typical plea came this summer from Angie Mason, of North Yorkshire, in England: \u201cI feel sick every time I see a picture,\u201d she said. \u201cHe must be in agony. How would we feel walking on all fours for 3 years?\u201dOthers feel just as strongly that humans should keep their hands off. According to state wildlife biologists, the bear is doing fine on his own; they estimated his weight at 300 to 350 pounds, though they do not know his age. They believe the bear is a male based on his size and images captured on video.\u201cDivision biologists note that, based on the video, the bear is active, appears healthy, a little larger than last year, and is thriving on its own having adapted to its condition,\u201d the post said.\u201cThe bear was able to find adequate food resources in an area of high bear density and to have successfully denned through at least the past two winters in its current condition,\u201d the post said. \u201cTherefore, there is no need for intervention at this time.\u201dIt is unclear how the bear was injured. A former state wildlife biologist speculated in 2014, when the bear was first spotted, that it was hit by a car. But the bear may also have a congenital defect; in various videos, the right front leg appears truncated, while the left paw dangles.\u201cOther than the videos, we haven\u2019t been able to get a close look at him,\u201d said Larry Hajna, a spokesman for the state Department of Environmental Protection, adding that biologists did not see a need to perform an examination of the bear.In an interview posted on YouTube last month, Tracy Leaver, the founder and executive director of Woodlands Wildlife Refuge in Alexandria Township, N.J., said the desire to help the bear was understandable, but misguided. She explained that he had clearly managed to find food and a den during successive winters, despite his limited mobility.\u201cThat\u2019s what wildlife does,\u201d she said. \u201cThey survive. He\u2019s over it. We\u2019re not, as people. We want to reach in, we want to help, we want to fix him.\u201d\u201cLife is wonderful for this animal right now,\u201d she added. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of natural food. To take that bear out of that beautiful home range that he\u2019s been living successfully in, and put him in an enclosure anywhere, would be like imprisoning him.\u201dLisa Ragoobir, who lives here in Oak Ridge, was encouraged that the bear seemed to have put on weight. \u201cThis year he looks much healthier,\u201d she said from her deck overlooking a meadow of cattails and milkweed, where the bear was seen strutting in June. \u201cThe first time I saw him, he was so skinny.\u201dBears are frequent visitors to her property, she said. Recently, a sow with three cubs lingered in the vegetation about 100 feet from Mrs. Ragoobir\u2019s back deck. She and her family take precautions, she said, just like everyone else in this corner of New Jersey, where bears are as common as wild turkey and deer are elsewhere.Her children know, for example, to move to the elevated deck from the yard, especially when cubs are present. \u201cI\u2019m afraid of snakes more than the bears,\u201d she said.\u201cHe\u2019s doing fine in the wild,\u201d Mr. Macgowan said. \u201cHe just does it on two legs. I think nature is best left where it is.\u201dState officials, in the meantime, say that Pedals has helped put wildlife in New Jersey on the world map \u2014 a nice change of pace for a state known to carry a chip on its shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s very compelling,\u201d Mr. Hajna said. \u201cThis is a very resilient bear. He\u2019s really captured the attention and hearts of a lot of people.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Oklahoma Man Is Charged With Killing Lebanese-American Neighbor", "Date": "2016-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe called the family \u201cdirty Arabs\u201d and tried to run over the mother with a car, the authorities said. An Oklahoma man\u2019s animosity toward the Lebanese-American family living next door, according to court records, took a fatal turn this month when he shot one of the sons on the porch of their house in Tulsa.The man, Vernon Majors, 61, was charged Tuesday with first-degree murder in the killing of his neighbor, Khalid Jabara, 37, on Aug. 12, according to a statement by the district attorney, Steve Kunzweiler.Mr. Majors, who had recently been released on bond after being suspected of hitting Mr. Jabara\u2019s mother with a car, was also charged with possession of a firearm by a felon, threatening an act of violence and malicious intimidation or harassment \u2014 the last count a misdemeanor reflecting the years of racism and violence that the authorities say has pervaded the stretch of grass connecting their yards.Rebecca Abou-Chedid, a friend who is serving as a spokeswoman for the Jabara family, said Mr. Jabara\u2019s death had devastated the tight-knit Lebanese community in Tulsa.\u201cFrom a larger community\u2019s perspective, what they see is a 37-year-old man shot and killed by a man who called them \u2018dirty Arab,\u2019\u201d Ms. Abou-Chedid said in a telephone interview. \u201cThere is no nuance. When people are using ethnic and racial slurs, this isn\u2019t just people being sensitive about it, but that they should be taken seriously.\u201dMarvin Lizama, Mr. Majors\u2019s lawyer for the earlier case, said in an email on Tuesday that he had no comment on the new charges.\u201cThose of us at St. Antony will always remember the young man who grew up in our parish,\u201d the announcement said. \u201cKhalid had a huge heart.\u201dThe American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee said that Mr. Jabara was clearly targeted because of his ethnicity. \u201cThe unfortunate murder of Jabara is a reflection of the impact and power of hateful rhetoric in politics and the society at large,\u201d the group said, adding that allowing such to continue \u201cwill lead to additional hate crimes against minority and immigrant communities.\u201dNews of Mr. Jabara\u2019s death found a home on social media with the trending #justice4khalid, where it was given broader context within the national discussion on race and violence.Like others in Tulsa, the Jabara family, who are Orthodox Christians, can trace their roots back to a village in southern Lebanon called Marjayoun, which families fled to escape war.Mr. Jabara\u2019s parents moved with Khalid and his older sister Victoria in 1983 and settled in the United States, where his younger brother Rami was born, Ms. Abou-Chedid said.While his siblings have moved away, Mr. Jabara had stayed to help with his parents\u2019 catering business and medical care.Mr. Majors, also known as Stanley Vernon Majors, moved next door to the Jabara family in 2011, Ms. Abou-Chedid said. While it was not immediately clear when the troubles started, family and court records document a history of animosity and of calls to the police to report racial slurs, harassment and threats by Mr. Majors.In 2013, Mr. Jabara\u2019s mother, Haifa, took out a protective order against Mr. Majors, which court records show that he violated. In September 2015, Mr. Majors rammed Ms. Jabara with his car, and he was charged with assault and battery, according to the documents.Ms. Jabara had broken bones and a collapsed lung, the family said.In May 2016, the district attorney\u2019s office tried to keep Mr. Majors in jail to await trial, citing his \u201cwanton disregard for the life of the victim and the safety of the public.\u201dMr. Majors, however, was able to make bail and was released.According to the police and Ms. Abou-Chedid, Mr. Jabara was home with his father on Aug. 12 when he called the police out of fear of Mr. Majors. Officer Leland Ashley said the police received a call from the Jabara house saying that Mr. Majors had banged on a window. Ms. Williams said her brother had called the police to report that Mr. Majors had a gun.The police responded but left without taking any action. Then, just before 7 p.m., Officer Ashley said, a neighbor reported that there had been a shooting. Mr. Jabara was taken to the hospital, where he died of his wounds.Mr. Majors was arrested, hiding near a library, about 11 p.m., the officer said.Mr. Kunzweiler, the district attorney, said in an emailed statement before announcing the charges that the family \u201cdid everything they were supposed to do and the system failed them.\u201dMs. Williams said her family had lived \u201cin fear of this man and his hatred for years.\u201d\u201cHe should not have been released without monitoring,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYet he was released and put back next door to us, the family he assaulted just months before. This is troubling at any time, but profoundly disturbing given the current climate of our country and the increase nationally in cases of hate crimes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fractured Lands: How the Arab World Came Apart", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "TKThis is a story unlike any we have previously published. It is much longer than the typical New York Times Magazine feature story; in print, it occupies an entire issue. The product of some 18 months of reporting, it tells the story of the catastrophe that has fractured the Arab world since the invasion of Iraq 13 years ago, leading to the rise of ISIS and the global refugee crisis. The geography of this catastrophe is broad and its causes are many, but its consequences \u2014 war and uncertainty throughout the world \u2014 are familiar to us all. Scott Anderson\u2019s story gives the reader a visceral sense of how it all unfolded, through the eyes of six characters in Egypt, Libya, Syria, Iraq and Iraqi Kurdistan. Accompanying Anderson\u2019s text are 10 portfolios by the photographer Paolo Pellegrin, drawn from his extensive travels across the region over the last 14 years, as well as a landmark virtual-reality experience that embeds the viewer with the Iraqi fighting forces during the battle to retake Falluja.It is unprecedented for us to focus so much energy and attention on a single story, and to ask our readers to do the same. We would not do so were we not convinced that what follows is one of the most clear-eyed, powerful and human explanations of what has gone wrong in this region that you will ever read.\u2013 JAKE SILVERSTEIN, EDITOR IN CHIEFWe\u2019re saving your reading progress so you can pick up where you left off later.Our destination that day in May 2015 was the place of Azar\u2019s greatest sorrow, one that haunted him still. The previous year, ISIS gunmen had cut a murderous swath through northern Iraq, brushing away an Iraqi Army vastly greater in size, and then turning their attention to the Kurds. Azar had divined precisely where the ISIS killers were about to strike, knew that tens of thousands of civilians stood helpless in their path, but had been unable to get anyone to heed his warnings. In desperation, he had loaded up his car with guns and raced to the scene, only to come to a spot in the road where he saw he was just hours too late. \u201cIt was obvious,\u201d Azar said, \u201cso obvious. But no one wanted to listen.\u201d On that day, we were returning to the place where the fabled Kurdish warriors of northern Iraq had been outmaneuvered and put to flight, where Dr. Azar Mirkhan had failed to avert a colossal tragedy \u2014 and where, for many more months to come, he would continue to battle ISIS.Azar is a practicing urologist, but even without the firepower and warrior get-up, the 41-year-old would exude the aura of a hunter. He walks with a curious loping gait that produces little sound, and in conversation has a tendency to tuck his chin and stare from beneath heavy-lidded eyes, rather as if he were sighting down a gun. With his prominent nose and jet black pompadour, he bears a passing resemblance to a young Johnny Cash.The weaponry also complemented the doctor\u2019s personal philosophy, as expressed in a scene from one of his favorite movies, \u201cThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly,\u201d when a bathing Eli Wallach is caught off guard by a man seeking to kill him. Rather than immediately shoot Wallach, the would-be assassin goes into a triumphant soliloquy, allowing Wallach to kill him first.\u201cWhen you have to shoot, shoot; don\u2019t talk,\u201d Azar quoted from the movie. \u201cThat is us Kurds now. This is not the time to talk, but to shoot.\u201dFor each of these six people, the upheavals were crystallized by a specific, singular event. For Azar Mirkhan, it came on the road to Sinjar, when he saw that his worst fears had come true. For Laila Soueif in Egypt, it came when a young man separated from a sprinting mass of protesters to embrace her, and she thought she knew the revolution would succeed. For Majdi el-Mangoush in Libya, it came as he walked across a deadly no-man\u2019s-land and, overwhelmed by a sudden euphoria, felt free for the first time in his life. For Khulood al-Zaidi in Iraq, it came when, with just a few menacing words from a former friend, she finally understood that everything she had worked for was gone. For Majd Ibrahim in Syria, it came when, watching an interrogator search his cellphone for the identity of his \u201ccontroller,\u201d he knew his own execution was drawing nearer by the moment. For Wakaz Hassan in Iraq, a young man with no apparent interest in politics or religion, it came on the day ISIS gunmen showed up in his village and offered him a choice.As disparate as those moments were, for each of these six people they represented a crossing over, passage to a place from which there will never be a return. Such changes, of course \u2014 multiplied by millions of lives \u2014 are also transforming their homelands, the greater Middle East and, by inevitable extension, the entire world.As a writer with long experience in the Middle East, I initially welcomed the convulsions of the Arab Spring \u2014 indeed, I believed they were long overdue. In the early 1970s, I traveled through the region as a young boy with my father, a journey that sparked both my fascination with Islam and my love of the desert. The Middle East was also the site of my first foray into journalism when, in the summer of 1983, I hopped on a plane to the embattled city Beirut in hopes of finding work as a stringer. Over the subsequent years, I embedded with a platoon of Israeli commandos conducting raids in the West Bank; dined with Janjaweed raiders in Darfur; interviewed the families of suicide bombers. Ultimately, I took a five-year hiatus from magazine journalism to write a book on the historical origins of the modern Middle East.Experience firsthand the battles Iraqi forces endured to retake the city of Falluja from ISIS.Text yourself a link to get the NYT VR app.Please enter a 10-digit US mobile number.For iOS and Android.

Your information is used only to deliver a one-time text message.In my professional travels over the decades, I had found no other region to rival the Arab world in its utter stagnation. While Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya set a record for longevity in the Middle East with his 42-year dictatorship, it was not that different elsewhere; by 2011, any Egyptian younger than 41 \u2014 and that was roughly 75 percent of the population \u2014 had only ever known two heads of state, while a Syrian of the same age had lived his or her entire life under the control of the father-and-son Assad dynasty. Along with political stasis, in many Arab nations most levers of economic power lay in the hands of small oligarchies or aristocratic families; for everyone else, about the only path to financial security was to wrangle a job within fantastically bloated public-sector bureaucracies, government agencies that were often themselves monuments to nepotism and corruption. While the sheer amount of money pouring into oil-rich, sparsely populated nations like Libya or Kuwait might allow for a degree of economic trickle-down prosperity, this was not the case in more populous but resource-poor nations like Egypt or Syria, where poverty and underemployment were severe and \u2014 given the ongoing regional population explosion \u2014 ever-worsening problems.I was heartened, in the Arab Spring\u2019s early days, by the focus of the people\u2019s wrath. One of the Arab world\u2019s most prominent and debilitating features, I had long felt, was a culture of grievance that was defined less by what people aspired to than by what they opposed. They were anti-Zionist, anti-West, anti-imperialist. For generations, the region\u2019s dictators had been adroit at channeling public frustration toward these external \u201cenemies\u201d and away from their own misrule. But with the Arab Spring, that old playbook suddenly didn\u2019t work anymore. Instead, and for the first time on such a mass scale, the people of the Middle East were directing their rage squarely at the regimes themselves.Then it all went horribly wrong. By the summer of 2012, two of the \u201cfreed\u201d nations \u2014 Libya and Yemen \u2014 were sliding into anarchy and factionalism, while the struggle against the Bashar al-Assad government in Syria had descended into vicious civil war. In Egypt the following summer, the nation\u2019s first democratically elected government was overthrown by the military, a coup cheered on by many of the same young activists who took to the streets to demand democracy two years earlier. The only truly bright spot among the Arab Spring nations was the place where it started, Tunisia, but even there, terrorist attacks and feuding politicians were a constant threat to a fragile government. Amid the chaos, the remnants of Osama bin Laden\u2019s old outfit, Al Qaeda, gained a new lease on life, resurrected the war in Iraq and then spawned an even more severe and murderous offshoot: the Islamic State, or ISIS.The scattershot nature of the Arab Spring makes it hard to provide a single answer. Some nations were radically transformed, even as others right next door were barely touched. Some of the nations in crisis were relatively wealthy (Libya), others crushingly poor (Yemen). Some countries with comparatively benign dictatorships (Tunisia) blew up along with some of the region\u2019s most brutal (Syria). The same range of political and economic disparity is seen in the nations that remained stable.Yet one pattern does emerge, and it is striking. While most of the 22 nations that make up the Arab world have been buffeted to some degree by the Arab Spring, the six most profoundly affected \u2014 Egypt, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen \u2014 are all republics, rather than monarchies. And of these six, the three that have disintegrated so completely as to raise doubt that they will ever again exist as functioning states \u2014 Iraq, Syria and Libya \u2014 are all members of that small list of Arab countries created by Western imperial powers in the early 20th century. In each, little thought was given to national coherence, and even less to tribal or sectarian divisions. Certainly, these same internal divisions exist in many of the region\u2019s other republics, as well as in its monarchies, but it would seem undeniable that those two factors operating in concert \u2014 the lack of an intrinsic sense of national identity joined to a form of government that supplanted the traditional organizing principle of society \u2014 left Iraq, Syria and Libya especially vulnerable when the storms of change descended.In fact, all but one of the six people profiled ahead are from these \u201cartificial states,\u201d and their individual stories are rooted in the larger story of how those nations came to be. The process began at the end of World War I, when two of the victorious allies, Britain and France, carved up the lands of the defeated Ottoman Empire between themselves as spoils of war. In Mesopotamia, the British joined together three largely autonomous Ottoman provinces and named it Iraq. The southernmost of these provinces was dominated by Shiite Arabs, the central by Sunni Arabs and the northernmost by non-Arab Kurds. To the west of Iraq, the European powers took the opposite approach, carving the vast lands of \u201cgreater Syria\u201d into smaller, more manageable parcels. Falling under French rule was the smaller rump state of Syria \u2014 essentially the nation that exists today \u2014 and the coastal enclave of Lebanon, while the British took Palestine and Transjordan, a swath of southern Syria that would eventually become Israel and Jordan. Coming a bit later to the game, in 1934, Italy joined the three ancient North African regions that it had wrested from the Ottomans in 1912 to form the colony of Libya.To maintain dominion over these fractious territories, the European powers adopted the same divide-and-conquer approach that served them so well in the colonization of sub-Saharan Africa. This consisted of empowering a local ethnic or religious minority to serve as their local administrators, confident that this minority would never rebel against their foreign overseers lest they be engulfed by the disenfranchised majority.This was only the most overt level of the Europeans\u2019 divide-and-conquer strategy, however, for just beneath the sectarian and regional divisions in these \u201cnations\u201d there lay extraordinarily complex tapestries of tribes and subtribes and clans, ancient social orders that remained the populations\u2019 principal source of identification and allegiance. Much as the United States Army and white settlers did with Indian tribes in the conquest of the American West, so the British and French and Italians proved adept at pitting these groups against one another, bestowing favors \u2014 weapons or food or sinecures \u2014 to one faction in return for fighting another. The great difference, of course, is that in the American West, the settlers stayed and the tribal system was essentially destroyed. In the Arab world, the Europeans eventually left, but the sectarian and tribal schisms they fueled remained.While today that image is remembered in the Arab world with resentment \u2014 the symbolism of this latest Western intervention in their region was quite inescapable \u2014 at the time it spurred something far more nuanced. For the first time in their lives, what Syrians and Libyans and other Arabs just as much as Iraqis saw was that a figure as seemingly immovable as Saddam Hussein could be cast aside, that the political and social paralysis that had so long held their collective lands might actually be broken. Not nearly so apparent was that these strongmen had actually exerted considerable energy to bind up their nations, and in their absence the ancient forces of tribalism and sectarianism would begin to exert their own centrifugal pull. Even less apparent was how these forces would both attract and repel the United States, damaging its power and prestige in the region to an extent from which it might never recover.At least one man saw this quite clearly. For much of 2002, the Bush administration had laid the groundwork for the Iraq invasion by accusing Saddam Hussein of pursuing a weapons-of-mass-destruction program and obliquely linking him to the Sept. 11 attacks. In October 2002, six months before Firdos Square, I had a long interview with Muammar el-Qaddafi, and I asked him who would benefit if the Iraq invasion actually occurred. The Libyan dictator had a habit of theatrically pondering before answering my questions, but his reply to that one was instantaneous. \u201cBin Laden,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no doubt about that. And Iraq could end up becoming the staging ground for Al Qaeda, because if the Saddam government collapses, it will be anarchy in Iraq. If that happens, actions against Americans will be considered jihad.\u201dBeginning in April 2015, the photographer Paolo Pellegrin and I embarked on a series of extended trips to the Middle East. Separately and as a writer-photographer team, we had covered an array of conflicts in the region over the previous 20 years, and our hope on this new set of journeys was to gain a greater understanding of the so-called Arab Spring and its generally grim aftermath. As the situation continued to deteriorate through 2015 and 2016, our travels expanded: to those islands in Greece bearing the brunt of the migrant exodus from Iraq and Syria; to the front lines in northern Iraq where the battle against ISIS was being most vigorously waged.We have presented the results of this 16-month project in the form of six individual narratives, which, woven within the larger strands of history, aim to provide a tapestry of an Arab World in revolt.The account is divided into five parts, which proceed chronologically as they alternate between our principal characters. Along with introducing several of these individuals, Part 1 focuses on three historical factors that are crucial to understanding the current crisis: the inherent instability of the Middle East\u2019s artificial states; the precarious position in which U.S.-allied Arab governments have found themselves when compelled to pursue policies bitterly opposed by their own people; and American involvement in the de facto partitioning of Iraq 25 years ago, an event little remarked upon at the time \u2014 and barely more so since \u2014 that helped call into question the very legitimacy of the modern Arab nation-state. Part 2 is primarily devoted to the American invasion of Iraq, and to how it laid the groundwork for the Arab Spring revolts. In Part 3, the narrative quickens, as we follow the explosive outcome of those revolts as they occurred in Egypt, Libya and Syria. By Part 4, which chronicles the rise of ISIS, and Part 5, which tracks the resulting exodus from the region, we are squarely in the present, at the heart of the world\u2019s gravest concern.I have tried to tell a human story, one that has its share of heroes, even some glimmers of hope. But what follows, ultimately, is a dark warning. Today the tragedy and violence of the Middle East have spilled from its banks, with nearly a million Syrians and Iraqis flooding into Europe to escape the wars in their homelands, and terrorist attacks in Dhaka, Paris and beyond. With the ISIS cause being invoked by mass murderers in San Bernardino and Orlando, the issues of immigration and terrorism have now become conjoined in many Americans\u2019 minds, forming a key political flash point in the coming presidential election. In some sense, it is fitting that the crisis of the Arab world has its roots in the First World War, for like that war, it is a regional crisis that has come quickly and widely \u2014 with little seeming reason or logic \u2014 to influence events at every corner of the globe.Laila Soueif at home in Cairo, June 2016.Wakaz Hassan outside Kirkuk, Iraq, December 2015.Azar Mirkhan in the Sinjar region, Iraq, November 2015.Majd Ibrahim in Dresden, Germany, November 2015.\u00a0Khulood al-Zaidi in Amman, Jordan, May 2015.Majdi el-Mangoush in Misurata, Libya, March 2016.\u00a0TKEgyptSee MapLaila was born into a life of both privilege and intellectual freedom. Her parents were college professors, and her older sister, Ahdaf Soueif, is one of Egypt\u2019s best-known contemporary novelists. She gravitated toward leftist politics at an early age. While studying mathematics at Cairo University in the mid-1970s, she met her future husband, Ahmed Seif, who was already the leader of an underground communist student cell calling for revolution.By then, Egypt had long been regarded as the political capital of the Middle East, the birthplace of revolutionary movements and ideas. In the modern era, it owed that status largely to the legacy of one man: Gamal Abdel Nasser.Well into the 1940s, Egypt, along with most of the rest of the Middle East, remained a lesser global concern, still in the thrall of the European powers that imposed their will on the area decades before. That began to change at the end of World War II with the discovery of vast new oil fields in the region, and with the collapse of the British and French colonial empires. The pace of change greatly accelerated when Nasser and his Free Officers Movement of junior military officers overthrew Egypt\u2019s Western-pliant king in 1952.Championing \u201cArab socialism\u201d and Pan-Arab unity, Nasser swiftly became a galvanizing figure throughout the Arab world, the spokesman for a people long dominated by foreigners and Western-educated elites. Just as crucial to the strongman\u2019s popularity was what he opposed: colonialism, imperialism and that most immediate and enduring example of the West\u2019s meddling in the region, the state of Israel.Nasser\u2019s success inspired many other would-be Arab leaders, nowhere more so than in the artificial states of the Middle East formed by the European powers. By 1968, military officers espousing the Baathist (\u201crenaissance\u201d) philosophy \u2014 a quasi-socialist form of Pan-Arabism \u2014 had seized power in Iraq and Syria. They were joined the following year by the Libyan lieutenant Muammar el-Qaddafi, and his somewhat-baffling \u201cthird universal theory,\u201d which rejected traditional democracy in favor of rule by \u201cpeople\u2019s committees.\u201d In all three countries, just as in Egypt, Western-favored monarchs or Parliaments were neutered or cast aside.But Nasser possessed an advantage that his fellow autocrats in the region did not. With a sense of national identity that stretched back millenniums, Egypt never seemed in danger of being torn apart; the centrifugal pull of tribes or clans or sectarian identity simply didn\u2019t exist there to the degree it did in Syria or Iraq. At the same time, Egypt\u2019s long tradition of relative liberalism had given rise to a fractious political landscape that ran the spectrum from secular communists to fundamentalist Islamists.Part of Nasser\u2019s genius was his ability to bridge these divides, and he did so by appealing both to Egyptian national pride and to a shared antipathy for the West, a vestige, perhaps, of 70 years of heavy-handed rule by Britain. Thus, even when Islamist conservatives became alarmed by Nas\u00adser\u2019s moves toward greater secularism, most still saw him as a hero for nationalizing Western businesses, and for besting Britain, France and Israel in the 1956 Suez crisis. Similarly, urban liberals like the Soueif family who disdained Nasser\u2019s strong-arm rule \u2014 his was a military dictatorship, after all \u2014 also cheered him for his leadership in the international Nonaligned Movement, for proudly thumbing his nose at the threats and enticements of the United States as it sought to compel Egypt into its orbit during the Cold War. This became the means by which Nasser and his successor, Anwar Sadat, maintained their grip on power: play left and right off each other as a matter of course; bring them together when needed by focusing on an external foe. Such maneuvering resulted in many odd political turns, including the first protest march of Laila Soueif.After working on leftist causes together throughout their time at the University of Cairo, Laila and Ahmed married in 1978. That same year, Egypt\u2019s political landscape was neatly turned upside down. In September, Sadat signed the Camp David accords, which led to an American-brokered peace treaty with Israel. That stunning about-face simultaneously propelled Egypt into the camp of American client-states and isolated it from much of the rest of the Arab world. Even more ominously for Sadat, what was seen in the West as an act of courage was regarded by most Egyptians as an act of betrayal and national shame. This was certainly the view of Laila and Ahmed. It was in the wake of the 1979 peace treaty that some of the men in Ahmed\u2019s underground cell began buying up arms on the black market and vowing armed action against the government. Those plans never got off the ground, though. Instead, it was a cabal of Islam\u00adist military plotters who finally got to Sadat, shooting and killing him at a military parade in Cairo in October 1981.A month later, Laila gave birth to her and Ahmed\u2019s first child, a boy they named Alaa. Their lives took on an air of increasingly apolitical domesticity, and by 1983, Laila, then 28, was juggling the demands of child-rearing with her new position as a professor of mathematics at Cairo University. All normalcy was shattered, however, when Sadat\u2019s successor, Hosni Mubarak, ordered a sweeping security crackdown. Among those ensnared in the dragnet were Ahmed and his colleagues in the underground cell. Severely tortured until he signed a full confession, Ahmed was then released to await his verdict. When that verdict was returned, in late 1984, the news was grim: Ahmed was found guilty of illegal weapons possession and sentenced to five years in prison.At the time, Laila was in France, having accepted a scholarship to further her math studies, but when Ahmed\u2019s sentence was handed down, she rushed back to Cairo with Alaa. Thanks to a curious loophole in Egyptian law, sentences for security-related offenses like Ahmed\u2019s had to be approved by the president, a process that normally took several months and during which the defendant could remain out on bail. It presented the couple with a tempting choice.\u201cWe had to decide,\u201d Laila, who is now 60, told me. \u201cDoes he submit and go into prison for five years, do we try to find some way to get him out of the country or do we go into hiding?\u201d She gave a nonchalant shrug. \u201cSo we went into hiding.\u201dFor several months, the couple lived as fugitives with their 3-year-old son. Ultimately, though, both realized it was a futile exercise. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t willing to leave the country,\u201d Laila said, \u201cand he couldn\u2019t stay in hiding forever. He decided it was easier to do the five years, so he gave himself up.\u201d But not necessarily easier for Laila. She became pregnant during her and Ahmed\u2019s brief time on the run, leaving her to tend to a second child, a girl they named Mona, as Ahmed served out his prison sentence.It was in prison that Ahmed experienced something of an epiphany. By continuing the entente with the United States and Israel that Sadat had begun, Mubarak naturally also inherited the taint of capitulation in the eyes of many of his countrymen. Unable to forge national cohesion by turning to the old external enemy card \u2014 after all, Egypt was now in bed with those supposed enemies \u2014 Mubarak had devised a more carefully calibrated system to play his secular leftist and militant Islamist oppositions against each other. Ahmed, thrown into prison with both factions, saw firsthand how this strategy played out when it came to even the most basic of human rights. As he would later tell Joe Stork of Human Rights Watch, \u201cThe communists would say secretly, \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter if Islamists are tortured.\u2019 And the Islamists would say, \u2018Why not torture communists?\u2019 \u201dDetermined to fight for judicial reform, Ahmed devoted himself to studying law in his prison cell. Within a month of his release in 1989, he was admitted to the Egyptian bar.This placed the ex-political prisoner and his wife at a crossroads. With Laila a tenured professor at Cairo University and Ahmed now a lawyer, the couple had the opportunity to carve out a comfortable existence for themselves among the Cairene elite. Instead, and at ultimately great personal cost, they would plunge ever deeper into Egypt\u2019s widening turmoils, trying to cross the very divides that had for so long been critical to the government's own survival.LibyaSee MapOver time, however, Qaddafi\u2019s rule increasingly bore less resemblance to Egypt\u2019s \u201csoft\u201d dictatorship and more to that of two others influenced by the Nasser model: the Baathist regimes of Saddam Hussein in Iraq and Hafez al-Assad in Syria. The parallels were quite striking. In all three countries, the dictators developed elaborate personality cults \u2014 their faces adorned posters and murals and postage stamps \u2014 and aligned themselves with the \u201canti-imperialist\u201d bloc of Arab nations, their stances helped along by deepening ties with the Soviet Union. True to the Baathist credo of \u201cArab socialism\u201d and Qaddafi\u2019s third universal theory, all three countries embarked on fabulously ambitious public works projects, building hospitals and schools and colleges throughout their lands and bankrolling those enterprises with oil receipts (in the cases of Libya and Iraq), or through the patronage of the Soviet Union (in the case of Syria). At the same time, the states established extravagantly bloated governmental structures, such that their ministries and agencies quickly became the main pillars of the economy; eventually more than half of the Libyan work force \u2014 Majdi el-Mangoush\u2019s parents among them \u2014 was on the government payroll, and the figures in Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq were similar. \u201cEverybody was connected to the state somehow,\u201d Majdi explained. \u201cFor their housing, for their job. It was impossible to exist outside of it.\u201dFor all their revolutionary rhetoric, the dictators of Libya, Iraq and Syria remained ever mindful that their nations were essentially artificial constructs. What this meant was that many of their subjects\u2019 primary loyalty lay not to the state but to their tribe or, more broadly, to their ethnic group or religious sect. To keep them loyal required both the carrot and the stick. In all three nations, the leaders entered into elaborate and labyrinthine alliances with various tribes and clans. Stay on the dictator\u2019s good side, and your tribe might be given control of a ministry or a lucrative business concession; fall on his bad side, and you\u2019re all out in the cold. The strongmen also carefully forged ties across ethnic and religious divides. In Iraq, even though most all senior Baathist officials were, like Saddam Hussein, of the Sunni minority, he endeavored to sprinkle just enough Shiites and Kurds through his administration to lend it an ecumenical sheen. In Hafez al-Assad\u2019s Sunni-majority Syria, rule by his Alawite minority was augmented by a de facto alliance with the nation\u2019s Christian community, giving another significant minority a stake in the status quo.This coalition-building had a unique geographic dimension in Libya. Aside from the historical rivalry that existed between the principal regions, Tripolitania and Cyrenaica, human settlement in Libya had always been clustered along the Mediterranean coast, and what developed there over the millenniums was essentially a series of semiautonomous city-states that resisted central rule. Thus, while Qaddafi didn\u2019t need to worry about religious sectarianism \u2014 virtually all Libyans are Sunni Muslims \u2014 he did need to think about drawing into his ruling circle the requisite number of Misuratans and Benghazians to keep everyone mollified.The state also had a very long memory, as Majdi el-Mangoush discovered growing up in Misurata. In 1975, two of his mother\u2019s relatives, both midlevel army officers, joined in a failed coup attempt against Qaddafi. While both were executed, that didn\u2019t remove the stain on the family name. (Testament to the enduring tribal nature of Libya, Majdi\u2019s mother was also of the Mangoush clan.)\u201cIt\u2019s not that we were directly persecuted because of it,\u201d Majdi, who is now 30, explained, \u201cbut it was something officials would always comment on: \u2018Ah, so you\u2019re a Mangoush.\u2019 It meant the government watched you a little closer, that you were never viewed as completely trustworthy.\u201dBut a perverse dynamic often takes hold in strongman dictators \u2014 and here, too, there were great similarities among Qaddafi, Hussein and Assad. Part of it stems from what might be called the naked-emperor syndrome, whereby, in the constant company of sycophants, the leader gradually becomes unmoored from reality. Another is rooted in the very nature of a police state. The greater the repression of security forces, the further that any true dissent burrows underground, making it that much harder for a dictator to know where his actual enemies are; this fuels a deepening state of paranoia, which can be assuaged only through even greater repression. By the 1990s, this cycle had produced a bizarre contradiction in Iraq, Syria and Libya: The more the leaders promoted a cult of hero worship and wallpapered their nations with their likenesses, the more reclusive those leaders became. In Majdi el-Mangoush\u2019s case, despite living in a country whose total population was less than that of New York\u2019s five boroughs, not once in 25 years did he ever personally glimpse Qaddafi. This was about the same number of times he uttered the dictator\u2019s name in a disparaging way in public. \u201cYou would only do that with family, or with the most trusted of friends,\u201d Majdi explained. \u201cIf you were around others and wanted to say something at all critical, it was \u2018our friend.\u2019 \u201dThere was another notable aspect to the posters and murals and mosaics of the dictators that could be seen everywhere in Libya, Iraq and Syria. In a great many of them, framing the image of the strongman, there appeared the outline of the country\u2019s borders. Perhaps that juxtaposition was designed to impart a simple message \u2014 \u201cI am the leader of the nation\u201d \u2014 but it\u2019s possible that the artificial-state dictators were also sending a message that was both more ambitious and more admonishing: \u201cI am the nation; and if I go, then so goes the nation.\u201d Of course, that may have been just what many members of the Mangoush clan \u2014 celebrated enough to have their own namesake neighborhood, notorious enough to be permanently marked \u2014 were secretly hoping.Tripoli, October 2002.Tripoli, October 2002.Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Tripoli, October 2002.Tripoli, October 2002.Tripoli, October 2002.KurdistanSee Map\u201cThe treaty was signed on the 6th of March,\u201d Azar Mirkhan, who is now 41, explained, \u201cand I was born on the 7th. My mother gave birth to me on the road, on the border between Iran and Iraq.\u201d He gave a rueful little laugh. \u201cThat is why my family has always called me \u2018the lucky child.\u2019 Kurdish luck.\u201dIndeed, it is hard to find any people quite as unlucky as the Kurds. Spread across the mountainous reaches of four nations \u2014 Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey \u2014 they have always regarded themselves as culturally apart from their neighbors and have constantly battled for independence from those nations they inhabit. The governments of these nations have tended to view their reluctant Kurdish subjects with both fear and distrust, and have taken turns quashing their bids for independence. Those governments have also periodically employed the Kurds \u2014 either their own or those of their neighbors \u2014 as proxy fighters to attack or unsettle their regional enemies-of-the-day. Historically, when those feuds were brought to an end, so, too, was the Kurds\u2019 usefulness, and they were soon abandoned \u2014 as occurred in the 1975 \u201cgreat betrayal.\u201dWhile the number of rebellions and proxy wars that have occurred across the breadth of Kurdistan over the past century is almost impossible to count, the biography of Heso Mirkhan\u2019s commander, Mustafa Barzani, provides something of a gauge. By the time of his death in 1979, the 75-year-old Barzani had not only waged war against Turkey, Iran (twice) and the central government of Iraq (four times), but had somehow found the energy to also take it to the Ottomans and the British and a host of Kurdish rivals. Multiply Barzani\u2019s list by four \u2014 the Kurds of Syria, Iran and Turkey have each had their own competing guerrilla groups and independence movements \u2014 and it all becomes a bit staggering.Despite the fears of these governments that they might some day be confronted by an independent \u201cgreater Kurdistan,\u201d the truth is that the differences among the Kurds in these four countries now rival their similarities. One thing they have in common, though, is a longstanding warrior tradition, and among the Kurds of northern Iraq, there is no more celebrated family of pesh merga \u2014 literally translated as \u201cthose who face death\u201d \u2014 than the Mirkhans.Following their father, Dr. Azar Mirkhan and four of his nine brothers have undergone pesh merga training; today, one brother, Araz, is a senior pesh merga commander on the front lines. But the family has paid a high price for membership in the warrior caste. Heso, the patriarch, was killed in combat in 1983, while one of Azar\u2019s older brothers, Ali, met the same end in 1994.But it hasn\u2019t been just the region\u2019s governments that have historically victimized the Kurds. In fact, few nations have brought the Kurds of northern Iraq more sorrow than the United States. After their role in the great betrayal of 1975, the Americans would again be complicit in the Kurds\u2019 suffering \u2014 if this time largely through silence \u2014 just 10 years later.By then, the United States\u2019 chief ally in the region, the shah of Iran, had been overthrown and replaced by the hostile Shiite fundamentalist government of Ayatollah Khomeini. Searching for a new partner in the region, Washington found one in Saddam Hussein. With the Iraqi dictator waging war against Khomeini\u2019s Iran, and with the United States secretly funneling weapons to his bogged-down military, by 1988 Hussein was so integral to the Reagan administration\u2019s realpolitik policy in the region that it simply looked the other way when Hussein launched the murderous Anfal campaign against his Kurdish subjects. A squalid new low was reached in March of that year, when Iraqi forces poison-gassed the Kurdish town Halabja, killing an estimated 5,000 people. Despite overwhelming evidence that Hussein was responsible for the atrocity \u2014 Halabja would figure prominently in his 2006 trial for crimes against humanity \u2014 Reagan-administration officials scurried to suggest it was actually the handiwork of Iran.What finally ended the American arrangement with Saddam Hussein was the Iraqi despot\u2019s 1990 decision to invade neighboring Kuwait, upsetting not just the Western powers but also most of his Arab neighbors. Perversely, that event very nearly led to yet another slaughter of Iraq\u2019s Kurds. Instead, it would eventually lead to their liberation, as well as mark the crucial moment when the United States propelled itself headlong into Iraq\u2019s sectarian and ethnic divides.In the face of Hussein\u2019s belligerence, President George H.W. Bush marshaled an international military coalition \u2014 Operation Desert Storm \u2014 that swiftly annihilated the Iraqi Army in Kuwait, then rolled into Iraq itself. With Hussein\u2019s government appearing on the verge of collapse, Bush encouraged the Iraqi people to rise up in revolt. Both of Iraq\u2019s marginalized communities \u2014 the Shiites in the south and the Kurds in the north \u2014 eagerly did so, only to see the United States suddenly take pause. Belatedly concluding that Hussein\u2019s demise might play into the hands of a still-hostile Iran, the Bush administration ordered American troops to stand down as the Iraqi Army regrouped and began a pitiless counterattack.To forestall a wholesale massacre of the rebels they had encouraged, the United States joined its allies in establishing a protected buffer zone in Kurdistan, as well as no-fly zones in both northern and southern Iraq. That still left Sad\u00addam Hussein in Baghdad, of course, and ready to take his revenge at the first opportunity. While the Bush administration concluded there was little it could do to aid the geographically isolated Shiites in the south \u2014 they soon suffered their own Anfal-style pogrom \u2014 to protect the Kurds, they forced Hussein to militarily withdraw from all of Kurdistan. Taking matters a step further, in July 1992 the Kurdistan Regional Government, an autonomous union of Iraq\u2019s three Kurdish provinces, was established.The Bush administration most likely regarded this Kurdish separation as a stopgap measure, to be undone once the tyrant in Baghdad had gone and the danger had passed. The long-suffering Kurds of Iraq saw it very differently. For the first time since 1919, they were free from the yoke of Baghdad, and they had their own nation in all but name. While very few in the West appreciated the significance at the time, the creation of the Kurdistan Regional Government, or K.R.G., marked the first dismantling of the colonial borders that were imposed on the region 75 years earlier, the de facto partition of one of the Middle East\u2019s artificial nations. In the years just ahead, tens of thousands of members of the Iraqi Kurdish diaspora would abandon their places of exile to return to their old homeland. In 1994, that included a 19-year-old college student, Azar Mirkhan, who had spent almost his entire life as a refugee in Iran.SyriaSee MapYet, until its demise, Homs had the distinction of being the most religiously diverse city in one of the most religiously mixed countries in the Arab world. Nationally, Syria is composed of about 70 percent Arab Sunni Muslims, 12 percent Alawites \u2014 an offshoot of Shia Islam \u2014 and a roughly equal percentage of Sunni Kurds; Christians and a number of smaller religious sects make up the rest. At the geographic crossroads of Syria, Homs reflected this ecumenical confluence, with a skyline punctuated not just by the minarets of mosques but also by the steeples of Catholic churches and the domes of Orthodox Christian ones.This gave Homs a cosmopolitan flavor not readily found elsewhere \u2014 so much so that in 1997, the Ibrahims, a Sunni couple, thought nothing of putting their first child, 5-year-old Majd, in a private Catholic school. As a result, Majd grew up with mostly Christian friends and a better knowledge of Jesus and the Bible than of Muhammad and the Quran. This didn\u2019t appear to bother Majd\u2019s parents at all. Although raised as Muslims, both were of the nominal variety, with his mother rarely even bothering to wear a head scarf in public and his father dragging himself to the mosque only for funerals.Such secular liberalism was very much in keeping with the new Syria that Hafez al-Assad sought to shape during his otherwise typically iron-fisted 30-year dictatorship, a secularism undoubtedly encouraged by his own religious minority status as an Alawite. After his death in 2000, the policy was carried on by his son, Bashar. A bland and socially awkward London-trained ophthalmologist, Bashar came to power largely by default \u2014 the Assad patriarch had been grooming his eldest son, Bassel, to take over until a fatal car accident in 1994. But Bashar, while projecting a softer, more modern face of Baathism to the outside world, also proved adroit at navigating the tricky currents of Middle Eastern politics. While still publicly vowing to recover the Golan Heights taken by Israel in the Six-Day War, he maintained an uneasy d\u00e9tente with Tel Aviv, even pursuing secret negotiations toward a settlement. By gradually loosening Syria\u2019s hold on neighboring Lebanon \u2014 its troops had occupied portions of the country since 1976, and Damascus was a prime supporter of Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah militia \u2014 the younger Assad was viewed increasingly favorably by the West.And to a young Majd Ibrahim then coming of age, it increasingly appeared that it was the West where his nation\u2019s future lay. Like other middle-class boys in Homs, he wore Western clothes, listened to Western music, watched Western videos, but Majd was also afforded a unique window onto the outside world. His father, an electrical engineer, worked at one of the best hotels in Homs, the Safir, and Majd \u2014 fascinated by the hotel, with its constant bustle of travelers \u2014 made any excuse to visit him as he went about his day. For Majd, the Safir was also a place of reassurance, a reminder that no matter what small deviations Syrian politics took along the way, he would always be able to inhabit the modern and secular world into which he was born.TKIraqSee MapYet, in the peculiar way that ambition can take root in the most inhospitable of settings, Khulood had always been determined to escape the confines of Kut, and she focused her energies on the one path that might allow for it: higher education. In this, she had an ally of sorts in her father. Ali al-Zaidi was insistent that all his children, including his three daughters, obtain college degrees, even if the ultimate purpose of the girls\u2019 education bordered on the obscure.\u201cMy father was very progressive in a lot of ways,\u201d she explained, \u201cbut even with him, going to college was never about my having a professional career. Instead, it was always the idea of \u2018Study hard, get a degree, but then find a husband.\u2019 \u201d She shrugged. \u201cThis was the Iraqi system.\u201d Khulood pursued a degree in English literature at a local university, but the expectation was that, degree in hand, she might teach English at a local school for a few years, then marry and start a family. Khulood had different plans, though: With her English proficiency, she would go to Baghdad and look for work as an interpreter for one of the few foreign companies then operating in Iraq.That scheme was sidetracked when, just three months short of her graduation, the Americans invaded Iraq. In the early morning of April 3, 2003, the fighting reached Kut. Advance units of the United States First Marine Expeditionary Force encircled the city, and for the next several hours methodically destroyed one Iraqi redoubt after another, their tanks and artillery on the ground complemented by close air support. Of this battle for her hometown, Khulood, then 23, heard a great deal but saw nothing. There was a simple explanation for this. \u201cWomen weren\u2019t allowed out of the house,\u201d she said.Before the invasion, Vice President Dick Cheney predicted that Americans would be \u201cgreeted as liberators\u201d in Iraq, and his prediction was borne out in the streets of Kut on April 4. As the Marines consolidated their hold on the city, they were happily swarmed by young men and children proffering trays of sweets and hot tea. Finally permitted to leave her home, Khulood, like most other women in Kut, observed the spectacle from a discreet distance. \u201cThe Americans were very relaxed, friendly, but mostly I was struck by how huge they seemed \u2014 and all their weapons and vehicles, too. Everything seemed out of scale, like we had been invaded by aliens.\u201dWhile there continued to be sporadic fighting elsewhere by remnants of Saddam Hussein\u2019s Baathist government \u2014 given the Orwellian label of \u201canti-Iraqi forces\u201d by the Bush administration \u2014 the few coalition troops who remained in Kut that spring and early summer felt secure enough to mingle free of body armor with residents and to patrol its streets in unprotected trucks. Those soldiers also quickly returned the city to something close to normalcy. The university was reopened after just a two-month interruption, enabling Khulood to obtain her bachelor\u2019s degree that August. The real work now was in rebuilding the nation\u2019s shattered economy and reconstituting its government, and to that end a small army of foreign engineers, accountants and consultants descended on Iraq under the aegis of the Coalition Provisional Authority, or C.P.A., the American-led transitional administration that would stand down once a new Iraqi government was in place.One of those who came was a 33-year-old lawyer from Oklahoma named Fern Holland. A human rights adviser for the C.P.A., Holland had a special brief in the summer of 2003 that included developing projects to empower women in the Shiite heartland of southern Iraq. In September 2003, that mission took her to Kut and her first encounter with Khulood.\u201cI will always remember the first time I saw Fern,\u201d Khulood said. \u201cShe brought a group of us women together to talk about the work she wanted to do in Iraq. She was surprisingly young \u2014 this is easy to forget, because her personality was so strong \u2014 with bright blond hair and a very open, friendly manner. I had never met a woman like her. I don\u2019t think any of us in that room had.\u201dWhat Holland told the women in the Kut meeting hall was no less exotic to them than her appearance. With the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, she said, a new Iraq was being established, one in which democracy and respect for human rights would reign supreme. What\u2019s more, to consolidate this new Iraq, everyone had a role to play, not least the women of Kut.For Khulood, that talk struck with the force of epiphany. This was the moment she had been waiting for her entire life. Almost immediately, she began doing volunteer work on women\u2019s rights projects for Holland. \u201cI had thought about these issues before, but under Saddam Hussein they were like fantasies,\u201d Khulood said. \u201cNow, I saw a future for myself.\u201dHolland was perhaps less confident. From past experience working in conservative and male-dominated societies in Africa, she suspected that it would only be a matter of time \u2014 and probably a very short time \u2014 before the forces of tradition rose up in opposition to her work, so she had to set change in motion quickly. She also knew that, as an outsider, her role needed to be a limited one; what was required was dynamic local women to spearhead the effort, women like Khulood al-Zaidi.The following month, Holland chose Khulood to be a representative at a national women\u2019s leadership conference, held under the auspices of the C.P.A. At that conference, Khulood received even headier news: She had been selected as part of a women\u2019s delegation that would soon travel to Washington to help draft the new Iraqi Constitution. When word of this spread at the conference, it provoked a backlash. \u201cA lot of the other women objected because I was so young,\u201d Khulood said. \u201cEven I thought it was maybe too much. But Fern insisted. She told the other women, \u2018Khulood represents the youth of Iraq \u2014 she is going.\u2019 She was my biggest supporter.\u201dOn that November 2003 trip to Washington, the 23-year-old fresh out of college met with a parade of dignitaries, including President George W. Bush. Upon her return, she was formally hired by the C.P.A. to serve as an assistant manager of the Kut media office. It was a very long way for a young woman who, less than a year earlier, had imagined no greater future than finding interpreter work with a foreign company. \u201cIt was a very exciting time,\u201d Khulood said. \u201cBecause you could feel everything changing so fast.\u201dNear Basra, March 2003.A protest in Baghdad, April 2003.Near Basra, April 2003.Near Basra, April 2003.The fall of Basra, April 2003.American soldiers in Baghdad, April 2003.IraqSee MapOnly 8 years old in 2003, Wakaz seemed destined for an exceedingly normal life, even a prosaic one. The youngest of five children born to an Iraqi bank clerk and his wife, he spent his childhood in the drowsy farming community of Dawr, just 15 miles down the Tigris River from Saddam Hussein\u2019s hometown, Tikrit. \u201cAll was very good there,\u201d he recalled. \u201cEasy.\u201dThat changed with the American invasion. Long considered a Baathist stronghold by virtue of Hussein\u2019s origins there, Tikrit and its environs were a prime early objective of the invaders, with the city itself the target of intense aerial bombardments. By mid-April 2003, coalition troops occupied the string of gaudy palace buildings erected by Hussein along the Tikrit riverfront and began conducting raids through the surrounding river towns in search of fugitive Baathist officials. The May 15 raid on Dawr netted 30 suspected Baathists \u2014 a startling number for such a small commu\u00adnity \u2014 but the town was soon to yield up an even greater prize. In mid-December 2003, American troops discovered a \u201cspider hole\u201d on the northern edge of Dawr and pulled out Hussein himself.The young Wakaz had only the vaguest grasp of all this. According to him, his family \u2014 Sunni, like most all residents of the Tikrit area \u2014 was not particularly religious, nor was it political in any way. He remembered hearing something about the mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners at an American-operated prison \u2014 clearly a reference to the Abu Ghraib scandal \u2014 and then there was the time American soldiers searched his family\u2019s home, but those soldiers were quite respectful, and the episode passed without incident.\u201cI know others had problems with the Americans,\u201d Wakaz said, \u201cbut my family, no. For us, we were really not affected at all.\u201dWhat the Hassan family did blame the invaders for, at least in a general way, was the ensuing collapse of the Iraqi economy, a downturn that cost Wakaz\u2019s father his job at the Rafidain Bank. To support his young family, the Hassan patriarch used his savings to open a small sweet shop on Dawr\u2019s main street. \u201cSo yes, our life was definitely much easier before the Americans came,\u201d Wakaz conceded. \u201cEven if it wasn\u2019t their fault directly, that is when everything became much harder.\u201dIraqSee MapIn their Iraqi war plans, the Pentagon had set down comprehensive blueprints detailing which strategic installations and government ministries were to be seized and guarded. But the American military seemed to have given little thought to the arsenals and munitions depots that Hussein had scattered about the country. In one town and city after another, these storehouses were systematically looted, sometimes under the gaze of coalition soldiers who did not intervene.The occupying authorities soon compounded this misstep. In a move now largely regarded as calamitous, one of the first actions taken by the C.P.A.\u2019s administrator, Paul Bremer, was to disband the Iraqi military. Just like that, hundreds of thousands of men \u2014 men with both military training and access to weapons \u2014 were being put out of their jobs by the summer of 2003.It may have been the edict immediately preceding that decree, however, that had the most deleterious effect. Under the terms of C.P.A. Order No. 1, senior Baath Party members were summarily dismissed from government positions and placed under a lifetime public-employment ban. In addition, employees in the upper echelon of all government institutions were to be investigated for Baathist affiliations. As critics pointed out, tens of thousands of apolitical Iraqi professionals \u2014 a group that included Khulood\u2019s radiologist father, Ali al-Zaidi \u2014 were compelled to join the party in the 1990s as part of a \u201crecruitment drive\u201d by Saddam Hussein; now these teachers and doctors and engineers were at risk of being disenfranchised.The effects of Order 1 stretched far beyond the dismissed Baathists. In Iraq, as in much of the rest of the Middle East, government offices operated on an elaborate patronage system in which most every employee, from senior staff down to the steward who brought refreshments to visitors, owed their jobs to the head man; as might be expected, that man \u2014 almost invariably a Baath Party member during Saddam Hussein\u2019s reign \u2014 usually handed out those jobs to members of his extended family or tribe. What the firing of as many as 85,000 Baathists actually meant, then, was the cashiering of countless more people and the instant impoverishment of entire clans and tribes.Under the weight of these blunders, it\u2019s remarkable that the Iraqi occupation didn\u2019t blow up sooner. An omen of what was to come occurred in August 2003, when the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad was destroyed by a truck bomb, killing 22, including the U.N.\u2019s special representative for Iraq, Sergio Vieira de Mello. That was followed by a steady escalation in attacks against coalition forces. By the beginning of 2004, C.P.A. officials perceived a deepening hostility toward their initiatives, so much so that even Fern Holland began to worry. As she wrote in an email to a friend in late January: \u201cWe\u2019re doing all we can with the brief time we\u2019ve got left. It\u2019s a terrible race. Wish us luck. Wish the Iraqis luck.\u201dOn March 8, 2004, the new provisional Constitution of Iraq was signed. The clause that set a goal of having 25 percent of future parliamentary seats held by women was largely credited to the behind-the-scenes lobbying of Fern Holland.The following afternoon, a Daewoo containing three C.P.A. civilian employees was traveling along a provincial highway when an Iraqi police pickup truck pulled alongside. With a blast of automatic gunfire, the car was sent careering across the highway before stalling on the shoulder; the men in the police truck then clambered out to finish off their victims with assault rifles. All three of the Daewoo's occupants were killed in the fusillade, marking them as the first C.P.A. civilians to be murdered in Iraq. That included the driver and presumed target of the attack, Fern Holland.Following Holland\u2019s murder, a sense of trepidation spread among the thousands of C.P.A. personnel scattered across Iraq. \u201cWe were all in a state of shock, of course,\u201d Khulood al-Zaidi said, \u201cbut I think we were also waiting to see what it meant, if it had been an attack on Fern in particular or if this was going to be something larger.\u201dThe answer came very soon. In tandem with the growing Sunni insurgency in central Iraq, through the first months of 2004, a radical Shiite cleric in Baghdad, Moktada al-Sadr, had been demanding a withdrawal of all coalition forces from the nation. In early April, Sadr unleashed his militia, the Mahdi Army, in an effort to bring that withdrawal about through a series of well-coordinated attacks against military and C.P.A. installations. Kut\u2019s turn came on April 5, when some 200 Mahdi militiamen began attacking the C.P.A. compound.Khulood spent hours trapped in the C.P.A. media office, as the coalition forces assigned to guard the compound returned fire. Finally a C.P.A. supervisor turned to Khulood. \u201cIf you are not afraid,\u201d he said, \u201cyou should just go.\u201dWith two other local workers, Khulood managed to thread her way out of the compound and, dodging down side alleys, to escape. With the C.P.A. compound subsequently abandoned, she remained in hiding as the Mahdi militiamen who now controlled Kut searched for any local C.P.A. employees left behind. Even after Ameri\u00adcan forces retook the city, Khulood remained so frightened she didn\u2019t leave her family\u2019s home for two weeks.The Mahdi uprising radically altered the flow of events in Iraq. Both Sunni and Shia militias sharply increased their attacks against coalition forces, marking the true beginning of the Iraq war. Despite this, the C.P.A. went ahead with their program of ceding control of Iraq to a new central government. In May, the last of the foreign civilians based in Kut began withdrawing, and within two months, the whole of the local C.P.A. infrastructure was placed under the authority of the new Baghdad government.For a time, this did seem to calm passions in Khulood\u2019s hometown, enough so that she vowed to continue the women\u2019s rights initiatives begun by her murdered mentor. That autumn, she helped found a small nongovernmental organization called Al-Batul, or Virgin. Its goals were modest. \u201cKut has a small Christian population,\u201d Khulood explained, \u201cso my idea was to bring Christian and Muslim women together to work on projects that were important to both communities. It was mainly to teach the women how to defend their rights, to show them that they didn\u2019t always have to obey what men said.\u201dBut in the deepening sectarianism spreading across Iraq, Sunni and Shia militants alike increasingly viewed the Christian community as the infidels within; in turn, terrified Christians were beginning to abandon the nation in droves, an exodus that would eventually reduce their numbers in Iraq by more than two-thirds. Further, the only possible source of funding for an endeavor like Al-Batul was from the foreign occupiers, enabling militants to denounce it as a front in the service of the enemy. Almost immediately, Khulood began receiving anonymous threats for continuing her work on \u201cAmerican issues,\u201d threats that escalated to the point where she was denounced by name in a local newspaper.The memory of that time caused Khulood, now 36, to become somber, reflective. \u201cI can see now that I was quite na\u00efve, that I didn\u2019t take the situation as seriously as I should have. But my feeling was that I was only working on things that might give women a better life, so how was I a threat?\u201dIn October 2004, the Al-Batul office in Kut was shot up. Undeterred, Khulood rented a second office, only to have it looted. That January, while attending a human rights training seminar in Amman, the capital of neighboring Jordan, she received a warning: If she resumed her work in Kut, she would be killed. She remained in Jordan for three months, but in April 2005 \u2014 a year after the death of Fern Holland and with the fighting in Iraq now spiraling into sectarian war \u2014 Khulood finally slipped back to her hometown.She recognizes now that this decision bordered on the foolhardy. \u201cIt was just very difficult for me to give up on this dream I had for Iraq,\u201d Khulood said, recalling how Holland told her that \u201cto bring change it takes people with courage, that sometimes you have to push very hard. Well, I didn\u2019t want to die, but Fern had, and I think I held onto this hope that if we kept trying, maybe things would improve.\u201dShortly after returning to Kut, Khulood went to the local police station to file a report about her looted office, only to be treated dismissively. A more ominous note was struck when she met with one of her old Al-Batul colleagues. \u201cWhy did you come back here?\u201d the woman asked. \u201cEveryone knows you\u2019re working for the Ameri\u00adcan Embassy.\u201d Her colleague\u2019s accusation came on the heels of a call summoning Khulood to the local militia headquarters. \u201cThat\u2019s when I finally saw there was no chance for me in Iraq, that if I tried any longer, they would surely kill me.\u201dEgyptSee MapBy then, Laila and her husband, Ahmed Seif, had been Egypt\u2019s most celebrated political dissident couple for well over a decade, serving as constant nuisances to the Mubarak government. Since his release from prison in 1989, Ahmed had become the nation\u2019s pre-eminent human rights lawyer, the champion of an eclectic array of defendants in politically motivated cases that included leftist university professors, Islamic fundamentalists and \u2014 in a nation where homosexuality remains effectively illegal \u2014 members of Cairo\u2019s gay community. When I first met him that autumn, Ahmed was involved in perhaps the most controversial case of his career, defending a group of men accused of complicity in a 2004 hotel bombing in the Sinai Peninsula that left 31 dead.For her part, and even while retaining her mathematics professorship at Cairo University, Laila had gained a reputation as one of Cairo\u2019s most indefatigable \u201cstreet\u201d leaders, the veteran of countless protest marches against the government. Part of what drove her was a keen awareness that, as a member of the Cairene professional class, she enjoyed a freedom to dissent that was all but denied to Egypt\u2019s poor and working class. \u201cHistorically,\u201d she said, \u201cthat bestowed a degree of immunity \u2014 the security forces really didn\u2019t like to mess with us, because they didn\u2019t know who in the power structure we could call up \u2014 but that also meant we had a responsibility, to be a voice for those who are silenced. And being a woman helped, too. In this culture, women just aren\u2019t taken that seriously, so it allows you to do things that men can\u2019t.\u201dBut she was also quite aware that her activism \u2014 and the government\u2019s grudging tolerance of it \u2014 fit neatly into the divide-and-rule strategy that Hosni Mubarak had employed since assuming power in 1981. In the past, Egyptian governments were able to gin up bipartisan support when needed by playing the anti-West, anti-Israel card, but Anwar Sadat traded that card away by making peace with Israel and going on the American payroll. The new strategy consisted of allowing an expanded level of political dissent among the small, urban educated class, while swiftly moving to crush any sign of growing influence by the far more numerous \u2014 and therefore, far more dangerous \u2014 Islamists.In Laila\u2019s estimation, what finally caused this strategy to fray was the launch of the second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, against Israel in September 2000. With most Egyptians of all politi\u00adcal persuasions holding that their government sold out the Palestinians with the 1979 peace treaty with Israel, Mubarak was suddenly powerless to muzzle pro-Palestinian demonstrations lest he be seen as an even greater lackey of the Americans. \u201cFor the first time,\u201d Laila explained, \u201cwe began organizing openly and publicly without taking any permission from the government and without taking cover under any of the so-called legitimate political parties. And what was the government going to do about it? This established the pattern \u2014 you don\u2019t wait for permission, you don\u2019t look for an existing political party to take you in, you just organize \u2014 that we used many, many times afterward.\u201dIn short order, street protests became a constant feature of Egyptian life. Even more dele\u00adterious from the government\u2019s point of view, fury over the Palestinian situation galvanized opposition groups from across the political spectrum to march and work together.With this new dynamic in place, the last thing Hosni Mubarak needed was another reminder to the Egyptian people of his fealty to Washington \u2014 but then came the United States\u2019 decision to invade Iraq.While astute enough to oppose that invasion in public, and to engage in high-profile diplo\u00admacy to try to head it off, Mubarak wasn\u2019t able to escape its fallout. In the eyes of many Egyptians, after 23 years of taking lucre from the Americans, the dictator was simply too much their puppet to make a show of independence now. That cynical view only hardened as the war in Iraq dragged on and the daily body count mounted. From 2002 through early 2005, some of the largest antiwar demonstrations in the Arab world were taking place in the streets of Cairo, and Laila Soueif was on the front lines in nearly every one of them. \u201cOf course, on the overt level it was to protest what was occurring in Iraq,\u201d Laila said, \u201cbut this also reflected the failure of Mubarak.\u201dAt the same time, the dictator did himself few favors with a series of domestic initiatives that further inflamed the opposition. Grooming his son Gamal as his successor, in February 2005 Mubarak engineered a rewriting of the Constitution that, while ostensibly allowing for direct presidential elections, actually rigged the system so as to make domination by his political party all but perpetual. In presidential elections that September, Mubarak won a fifth six-year term with nearly 89 percent of the vote, after having arrested the only notable candidate to stand against him, Ayman Nour. Under mounting pressure at home and abroad, he reduced his interference in the November 2005 parliamentary elections, only to see the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist party still officially banned, take an unprecedented 20 percent of the seats.By late 2005, when I spent six weeks traveling through Egypt, growing contempt for the government was evident everywhere. To be sure, much of that antipathy derived from the nation\u2019s economic stagnation and from the corruption that had enabled a small handful of politicians and generals to become fabulously rich \u2014 the Mubarak family financial portfolio alone was reported to run into the billions \u2014 but it also had a strong anti-American component, and pointed up a profound disjuncture. At the same time that Egypt was regarded in Washington as one of the United States\u2019 most reliable allies in the Arab world, in no small part because of its continuing entente with Israel, over the course of scores of interviews with Egyptians of most every political and religious persuasion, I failed to meet a single one who supported the Israeli peace settlement, or who regarded the American subsidies to the Mubarak government, then approaching $2 billion a year, as anything other than a source of national shame. As Essam el-Erian, deputy head of the Muslim Brotherhood, bluntly told me: \u201cThe only politics in Egypt now are the politics of the street, and for anyone to work with the Americans is to write their politi\u00adcal death sentence.\u201dIt was during this time of ferment that the three children of Laila Soueif and Ahmed Seif, who previously had shown little interest in activism, began to have a change of heart about politics. The first to make the evolution was their son, Alaa, a pioneering Egyptian blogger, and it happened when he accompanied Laila to a protest march in May 2005.\u201cHe had become very interested in citizen journalism,\u201d Laila said, \u201cso with all the street actions surrounding the Constitution and Mubarak running again, he had begun coming down to cover the demonstrations \u2014 not to participate, just to report on them.\u201dLaila Soueif is a tough, unsentimental woman, and if she harbored any pride \u2014 or, in light of what was to come, regret \u2014 over her children\u2019s turn to activism, she didn\u2019t let on. \u201cI never tried to dissuade them. Even if I had wanted to \u2014 and I probably did at times \u2014 I didn\u2019t. That kind of thing is useless. They\u2019re not going to listen to you anyway, so you just get into fights.\u201dRefugees fleeing Israeli airstrikes in Tyre, July 2006.Moments after an Israeli airstrike in Tyre, July 2006.Civilians fleeing in southern Lebanon, July 2006.After an Israeli airstrike in Qana, July 2006.A wounded Hezbollah fighter in Tyre, August 2006.After an Israeli airstrike in Beirut, August 2006.After an Israeli airstrike in Beirut, August 2006.A mass burial in Tyre, July 2006.LibyaSee MapAlong Tripoli Street, one of the city\u2019s main thoroughfares, a municipal work crew with a cherry-picker was methodically taking down the posters of Muammar el-Qaddafi that hung from every lamppost.It was part of an attempt by the Libyan dictator to put a kinder, gentler face on his government. While ostensibly directed at the Libyan people, the campaign was really meant for Western consumption.In the days leading up to the invasion of Iraq, there had been talk in President George W. Bush\u2019s inner circle that once Saddam Hussein was dispensed with, the troublesome Qaddafi would be next. Once the Iraq invasion began in March 2003, the Libyan dictator hurried to make amends with the Americans. He offered a settlement over his country\u2019s role in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland \u2014 without explicitly admitting guilt, the Libyan government agreed to set aside $2.7 billion in compensation to the families of the 270 victims \u2014 and began quietly dismantling his nation\u2019s fledgling program for chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. Even more quietly, Libyan intelligence agents shared dossiers with their American counterparts on suspected Al Qaeda operatives and other Islamic fundamentalists in the region. On the home front, the goal was to create at least the illusion of political liberalization, and one aspect was to remove some of the tens of thousands of posters and billboards of \u201cthe Leader\u201d that wallpapered the nation.Qaddafi soon thought better of the whole egalitarian makeover. By 2006, the United States had restored full diplomatic relations with his government; while officially a response to the abandonment of the Libyan unconven\u00adtional-weapons program, certainly a contributing factor was that, amid the deepening quagmire of the Iraqi misadventure, there was not going to be any grand American crusade against the region\u2019s other dictators. Which also meant that Qaddafi could quietly abandon his reform drive. \u201cIt was just a bit of theater,\u201d Majdi said. \u201cNothing really changed, and after a few months, I don\u2019t think anyone even remembered it.\u201dBut that day hadn\u2019t yet arrived when the cherry-picker made its way down Misurata\u2019s Tripoli Street. Majdi was still observing the spectacle when an elderly man emerged from a nearby alley.For a long moment, the old man stared slack-jawed in amazement at the sight before him. He then rushed over to one of the discarded posters, removed a shoe and \u2014 in a gesture of insult common throughout the Arab world \u2014 began beating it against Qaddafi\u2019s likeness amid a torrent of curses.A municipal worker came over to ask what he was doing.\u201cThe bastard\u2019s gone at last, no?\u201d the old man asked. \u201cThere\u2019s been a coup?\u201dWhen the worker set him straight, the man stammered out an explanation for his behavior \u2014 he\u2019d been very ill lately, given to fits of lunacy \u2014 and then hurried away.Jordan \u2022 United States \u2022 IraqSee MapOne evening that September, as Wisam and a friend walked along a Kut street, someone with an assault rifle killed them both in a burst of gunfire. \u201cHe was 25,\u201d Khulood said softly. \u201cSome people say he was killed because of the work I was doing, but I hope that isn\u2019t true.\u201dA few months after Wisam\u2019s murder, Khulood faced a new ordeal when, working for an NGO, she rebuffed the demands of a corrupt but well-placed Jordanian businessman looking for kickbacks. He was the wrong person to cross. Shortly after, she was ordered to leave Jordan. Facing almost-certain death if forced to return to Iraq, Khulood turned to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for emergency resettlement in a third country.Among the more unlikely possibilities for resettlement was the United States. In 2008, American troops were still embroiled in an Iraqi civil war, and the Bush administration had strict caps in place (albeit recently loosened) on the number of Iraqis to be given refuge; to let in all those who had fled the country \u2014 and there were an estimated half-million displaced Iraqis in Jordan alone \u2014 would belie its talking point that the corner had finally been turned in the war. In light of the grave danger Khulood faced, how\u00adever, the U.N.H.C.R. placed her in its own special program, reserved for only the most vulnerable of refugees, and for those in this pool, the Americans had a spot available. In July 2008, Khulood boarded a plane bound for San Francisco.It\u2019s hard to imagine a more extreme transition, from the cramped, tumbledown apartment she shared with her father and two sisters in Amman to a pleasant one-bedroom in San Francisco, and Khulood reveled in her new life. \u201cJust to have the freedom to go wherever I wanted, and to not think something bad might happen to me. And I don\u2019t mean just the war. For a woman to travel alone in Iraq \u2014 maybe it happened in Baghdad, but never in Kut, and so some days I would just take a bus or the metro for hours. It was something I had never really imagined before.\u201dHer career prospects were also much improved. In Iraq, Khulood studied English because it seemed to offer the greatest chance at future freedom for a young woman, but in the United States the opportunities were endless. \u201cAfter one year, I would get my green card, and then I could apply for scholarships to study whatever I wanted. I became very ambitious.\u201dThe one continuing source of worry was for her divided family back in Iraq and Jordan. While she knew those in Kut wouldn\u2019t leave, Khulood was desperate to release her father and sisters from their limbo existence in Amman and, soon after reaching San Francisco, she started the paperwork to have them join her.Three months later, Khulood received both good and bad news. Her two sisters were approved for resettlement. Their father, how\u00adever, was rejected. The sisters remained in Jordan while the family appealed the decision, but Ali al-Zaidi was rejected again.By February 2009, seven months after Khulood\u2019s arrival in San Francisco, there was still no progress in the effort to resettle her father. It was then she made a fateful decision: She would return to Jordan and work on his case there.\u201cMy friends in San Francisco couldn\u2019t understand it,\u201d she recalled. \u201cWhy, when you have a new life here, why would you ever go back?\u201d Khulood grew thoughtful for a moment, as if still struggling for an answer. \u201cBut how to explain my culture to them? In Iraq, family is the most important thing, you can never turn away from it, so how could I and my sisters enjoy this nice life in America but leave our father behind? We could never live with the shame of that. So I went back.\u201dIn Amman, Khulood tirelessly pursued any angle she could think of to win her father\u2019s exit, petitioning for settlement not just in the United States but also in a half-dozen European nations. Nothing worked.Worse, Khulood had walked herself into legal limbo. As she was warned before leaving San Francisco, under the stipulations of American immigration law, refugees awaiting the permanent status of a green card cannot leave the country for longer than six months. By returning \u2014 and staying \u2014 in Jordan, Khulood had lost her refugee classification. Now, along with the part of her family that she had brought out of Iraq, Khulood was stranded. She could not go home or to a third country, hostage to the whim of a state \u2014 Jordan \u2014 that was anxious to shed her.A M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res facility for Iraqi refugees in Amman, Jordan, February 2008.M.S.F. facility in Amman, February 2008.M.S.F. facility in Amman, February 2008.M.S.F. facility in Amman, February 2008.M.S.F. facility in Amman, February 2008.Iraqi refugees in Damascus, Syria, February 2008.Iraqi refugee in Damascus, February 2008.Iraqi refugee in Damascus, February 2008.SyriaSee Map\u201cI can never remember my father saying anything about the regime, good or bad,\u201d Majd Ibrahim said. \u201cAnd I never remember any of my relatives or neighbors doing it either. When it came to the state, the most anyone would criticize was maybe the corrupt traffic policeman at the corner. You just didn\u2019t talk about that stuff with anyone.\u201dBecause of his liberal upbringing, Majd experienced a shock when he left his Catholic school at the end of the ninth grade and transferred into a state high school. His modern and secular ways often estranged him from his more Islamist-minded classmates, and the instruction was abysmal. But high school is a bad time for a lot of people, and Majd\u2019s life brightened considerably upon graduating in summer 2010. While failing to obtain the high marks on the national exam that would have enabled him to pursue one of the \u201chigher\u201d professions \u2014 engineering or medicine \u2014 he did sufficiently well to enter Al-Baath University in Homs that autumn to pursue a degree in hotel management.This was undoubtedly a better fit for Majd regardless. The handsome, outgoing young man had a natural charm that enabled him to develop a quick rapport with most anyone, joined to an intense curiosity about the larger world beyond Homs. With his degree in hand, he envisioned a future at one of the luxury hotels in Damascus \u2014 they \u201crepresented one of the best ways to advance,\u201d he said, \u201cto have a good life.\u201dBut there was another feature of his hometown that Majd had probably scarcely given thought to in his short life: In almost every way, Homs truly was the crossroads of Syria. Located near the midpoint of the highway between the nation\u2019s two largest cities, Damascus and Aleppo, Homs was also the eastern terminus of the highway linking Syria\u2019s interior to its coastal provinces. Just as significant, it was the hub of the nation\u2019s gas- and oil-refinery industry \u2014 quite logically, since the pipelines leading from the oil and natural-gas fields in the eastern deserts passed directly through the city on their way to the coast. If all this served to make Homs a prosperous town, it also meant that, in the event of a war, it was a place all sides would fight furiously to control.By the time Majd started at Al-Baath University, that war was just months away.TKEgyptSee MapThe following day, as Laila approached Tahrir Square, she realized this indeed was something altogether different from the toothless Egyptian protests of the past. Until now, the Cairene activist community had considered a protest successful if it drew several hundred demonstrators. In Tahrir Square on Jan. 25, the crowd was at least 15,000, and Laila soon heard about the many thousands more who had converged on different rallying points around Cairo and in other towns and cities across Egypt. In Tahrir, as elsewhere around the nation, the stunned security forces simply stepped aside, as the emboldened crowds\u2019 calls for reform gave way to open demands for Hosni Mubarak\u2019s fall.The protests continued over the next two days, until, on Jan. 28, Laila concluded that they truly did have a revolution on their hands. That morning, she and some friends traveled to the Imbaba neighborhood in northwest Cairo to join a group intending to march on Tahrir, only to be met by a wall of soldiers in riot gear. After dispersing the protesters, the soldiers pursued them into Imbaba\u2019s narrow alleyways, firing tear gas as they went.\u201cThat was a very stupid mistake,\u201d Laila explained. \u201cThese are small alleys where people are practically living in the street, so that just brought down Imbaba. It became a fixed battle between the troops and the residents, and there was absolutely no moving those people. They were going to break down these soldiers and torch the police stations, or die trying.\u201dThe battle for Imbaba continued late into the afternoon. Laila, having become separated from her friends, decided to walk to downtown alone. It was an eerie journey. The streets were deserted, and fires raged in the growing dusk: cars, barricades, police stations burning. Echoing off the surrounding buildings came the sound of gunfire, some single shots, others the sustained bursts of assault rifles. With darkness falling, Laila finally emerged onto Ramses Street, a major thoroughfare in central Cairo.\u201cAnd suddenly, this huge crowd of demonstrators appeared,\u201d she recalled, \u201crunning down Ramses. They had just broken through the police cordons, and they were running to get to Tahrir. One young man saw me standing there, and he came over and hugged me \u2014 he\u2019d obviously seen me before, in Tahrir \u2014 and said, \u2018I told you we would have a revolution!\u2019 And that was the moment when I knew it was true, and that we would be victorious.\u201dOver the next week, both the size and the militancy of the demonstrations grew, but so did the harshness of the government\u2019s response, with soldiers and the police increasingly trading tear gas for live ammunition. On Feb. 1, a defiant Mubarak took to the airwaves vowing never to leave Egypt \u2014 \u201cOn its soil I will die\u201d \u2014 and the following day there came the bizarre spectacle, called the Battle of the Camel, when scores of state-\u00adsponsored thugs astride horses and camels attacked those encamped in Tahrir Square with riding crops and whips.The following day, Ahmed Seif\u2019s law center was raided by the military police, and he and dozens of others were hauled off for questioning at the headquarters of military intelligence. For two days, Ahmed was interrogated by a variety of officers, but he would have reason to recall one encounter in particular. It came on the morning of Feb. 5, when the chief of military intelligence, a colorless general named Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, going about other business, happened to stride past Ahmed and several other prisoners. In an impromptu lecture, Sisi warned his captive audience that they should all respect Mubarak and Egypt\u2019s military leadership and that, once released, they should go home and forget Tahrir Square. When Ahmed, forgoing respectful silence, retorted that Mubarak was corrupt, the general\u2019s haughty manner swiftly changed. \u201cHe became angry; his face became red,\u201d Ahmed recalled a few years later to The Guardian. \u201cHe acted as if every citizen would accept his point and no one would reject it in public. When he was rejected in public, he lost it.\u201dUpon his release that day, Ahmed stopped by his home for a change of clothes and then immediately returned to Tahrir Square.It soon became clear that the regime was losing control. Across Egypt came reports of army units refusing orders to fire on demonstrators, and in Tahrir Square television cameras captured images of soldiers embracing the protesters and sharing cigarettes with them.On Feb. 11, the clock finally ran out on Hosni Mubarak. After submitting his resignation, the president and his immediate family boarded a plane and fled to their palatial retreat in the Red Sea resort town Sharm el Sheikh. At the news, all of Egypt erupted in celebration, and nowhere more so than in Cairo\u2019s Tahrir Square.But among a small handful of Egyptians, joy was already tinged with a note of disquiet, especially when it was announced that a group of senior military officers, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, or SCAF, would serve as an interim government until elections were held. One of those who worried was Laila Soueif.\u201cIn the last few days of Mubarak,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen we could see what was coming, I and some of the other independents, we tried to talk to all the different political factions. \u2018Seize power. Don\u2019t wait for permission. Just seize power now before the military steps in.\u2019 And everyone said: \u2018Yes, of course, that\u2019s a good idea. We\u2019ll organize a meeting to talk about it in a couple of days.\u2019 \u201d Laila shook her head, gave a bitter little laugh. \u201cBut maybe it was asking too much. Maybe we simply couldn\u2019t do it at that point. People needed to feel they had won. Not us, the politicos, but all these millions of people who had come down to the street. They needed a time to feel victorious.\u201d She sighed, and then fell silent for a moment. \u201cI don\u2019t know. To this day, I don\u2019t know. But I think that was our critical moment, and we lost.\u201dNear Tahrir Square in Cairo, February 2011.Tahrir Square, February 2011.Tahrir Square, February 2011.Near Tahrir Square, February 2011.Tahrir Square, February 2011.Near Tahrir Square, February 2011.Near Tahrir Square, February 2011.Tahrir Square, February 2011.LibyaSee Map\u201cThat\u2019s when we knew something big had happened,\u201d Majdi recalled, \u201cbecause this was unlike anything we\u2019d seen before. But still, no one would tell us what was going on.\u201dMajdi hoped he would get an explanation when classes resumed the next morning, but the civilian instructors failed to show up. Throughout that day, Majdi stayed in the constant company of his best friend at the academy, Jalal al-\u00adDrisi, a 23-year-old cadet from Benghazi. In contrast to the shy Majdi, Jalal, wiry and quick on his feet, was always ready with an irreverent joke or an elaborate prank. What the two shared was a fascination with science and gadgetry \u2014 Jalal was studying aviation weaponry \u2014 and over the course of the previous two and a half years, they had become inseparable. Jalal frequently spent his weekend leaves at the Mangoush family home in Misurata, a hospitality that was reciprocated when Majdi spent part of the summer of 2009 with the Drisis in Benghazi. In the bizarre news-free environment that existed at the academy, the young men tried to puzzle out what was happening.Over the next two days, the gunfire beyond the walls continued sporadically. The sound would draw near at times, only to recede; intense exchanges would be followed by long periods of quiet.No sooner did Qaddafi\u2019s address end than the gunfire in Misurata significantly escalated. \u201cIt was like the security forces had been awaiting orders for what to do,\u201d Majdi said. \u201cAfter the speech, they just opened up everywhere.\u201dThe cadets remained quarantined; they were besieged by elements outside the compound walls whose goals they weren\u2019t allowed to know and kept within those walls by soldiers who clearly didn\u2019t trust them. As the days passed and the unseen gun battles raged, the students lounged around their barracks wondering what was to become of them. It was virtually all Majdi el-\u00adMangoush and Jalal al-\u00adDrisi could talk about. \u201cWe would sit together for hours and go over every little detail, every clue we had picked up,\u201d Majdi said. \u201c \u2018What did it mean? Did it mean anything?\u2019 But sometimes it got to be too much. We had to stop. We had to talk about football or girls, anything to distract us.\u201dTheir peculiar limbo ended on the night of Feb. 25, when soldiers of the elite 32nd Brigade suddenly appeared on the base. Announcing that they had come from Tripoli to \u201crescue\u201d the cadets, the commandos ordered the students to gather their things and run to a gathering point at the edge of the compound where buses were waiting.Someone in the vaunted 32nd had made a logistical error, however. To transport the 580 cadets, just two buses had been ordered. With each vehicle filled to bursting, the excess students were crammed wherever they might fit in the brigade\u2019s jeeps and armored cars, and then the convoy trundled into the night for the long journey to Tripoli.Beyond effecting their \u201crescue\u201d from Misurata, the regime in Tripoli didn\u2019t really seem to know what to do with its young charges either. Bused to a vacant military high school compound on the southern outskirts of the city, the cadets were billeted in barrack halls and empty classrooms but barred from leaving or having any contact with their families. That edict was enforced by armed soldiers posted at the gates.But the confines of the Tripoli high school were a good deal more porous than those of the air force academy, and from their minders the cadets gradually learned something of the conflict that had befallen their nation. Although the unrest was fomented by criminal gangs and foreign mercenaries in the hire of Libya\u2019s Western enemies, they were told, misguided segments of the population had joined in to spread it. By the beginning of March, this foreign-\u00adspawned criminality was most intense in Misurata and Benghazi, and both cities had become pitched battlegrounds.Provided with this narrative, Majdi was not altogether surprised when, in mid-March, Western alliance warplanes began appearing over Tripoli to bomb government installations. It seemed merely to confirm that the nation was being attacked from beyond. Naturally, the situation also caused both Majdi and Jalal to worry about the fate of their hometowns and wonder which of their friends might have been seduced into joining the traitors\u2019 ranks. \u201cThat\u2019s something we talked about a lot,\u201d Majdi said. \u201c \u2018Oh, Khalid was always a little crazy; I bet he\u2019s gone with them.\u2019 \u201dThe cadets seemed gradually to win the trust of the regime, enough for one large group to be transferred to a military base in mid-\u00adApril to begin training on missile-\u00adguidance systems. Neither Majdi nor Jalal were selected for this mission, however, and their stay at the high school dragged on. Then one day in early May, Majdi ran into an old acquaintance at the barracks. The acquaintance, Mohammed, was now a military intelligence officer. He wanted to talk to Majdi about Misurata. The two chatted for some time, with Mohammed asking about different locations in the city and if the young cadet might know who the town\u2019s \u201ccivic leaders\u201d were. Majdi thought nothing of the conversation, but one afternoon a few days later, he was called to headquarters.There, an officer informed Majdi that he had been selected to join the cadets undergoing missile-\u00adguidance training; the jeep that would transport him to the base was leaving immediately. So hurried was his departure that Majdi didn\u2019t even have time to say goodbye to Jalal.But the jeep driver didn\u2019t take him to the army base. Instead, he followed the Tripoli ring road to the coastal highway and then turned east.By early evening, they had reached Ad Dafiniyah, the last town before Misurata and the farthest limits of government control. There, Majdi was led into a small farmhouse, where he was told someone wanted to speak to him on the phone. It was Mohammed, the military intelligence officer.As Mohammed explained, the young air force cadet had been chosen for a \u201cspecial patriotic mission\u201d: He was to slip into Misurata and find out who the rebel leaders were and where they lived. Once he had done this, he would pass the information to a liaison officer secreted within Misurata, a man named Ayoub. To make contact with Ayoub, Majdi was given a Thuraya satellite phone and a number to call.Upon hearing all this, Majdi had two thoughts. One was about his friends at home: Ever since hearing about the scale of fighting in Misurata, he assumed that some of his friends must have joined the other side. If he carried out this mission, it might very well result in their deaths.The other thought was of a recent conversation he had with Jalal. His friend had awoken in a despondent state of mind, explaining that he\u2019d had a terrible dream, and it took Majdi some time to coax out the details. \u201cI dreamt that you and I were sent to fight in Misurata,\u201d Jalal finally revealed, \u201cand that you were killed.\u201dBut any hesitation swiftly passed. In his goldfish-\u00adbowl existence in Tripoli, Majdi had heard only what the regime wanted him to hear, and if he didn\u2019t believe all of it, he believed enough of it to want to help defeat the foreigners and their followers who were destroying Libya, even if this included people he knew. Perhaps most of all, he just wanted the limbo to end. For nearly three months, he had been cut off from both his family and the outside world, and he simply wanted something \u2014 anything \u2014 to happen. So he agreed.Early the next morning, Majdi said goodbye to his companions at the farmhouse and headed alone into no man\u2019s land. Misurata lay some 10 miles to the east. In the right front pocket of his pants he carried his military identification card. If stopped by the rebels, this card in itself was unlikely to cause him problems; countless government soldiers had deserted, and the fact that Majdi was from Misurata would certainly lend credence to his explanation that he was trying only to go home. The satellite phone in his left pocket was a very different matter, though. With the severing of internet and cellphone reception, the Thuraya had become the standard mode of communication for regime operatives in the field, and if the rebels discovered Majdi\u2019s \u2014 sure to be found in the most cursory of searches \u2014 they would inevitably conclude that he was coming into Misurata as a spy. Under those circumstances, summary execution was probably the most merciful outcome he could hope for.As he walked, the sound of gunfire grew in intensity, and there was the occasional rumble of distant artillery explosions. But between the light wind and the rolling-\u00adhill topography of the Misurata coastal shelf, it was quite impossible for Majdi to determine how close any of it was or even its direction. He tried to bear in mind something he picked up in basic training, that the most worrisome noise on a battlefield wasn\u2019t gunshots but rather a soft popping sound, like the snapping of fingers. This was the sound the air made as it rejoined behind a bullet, and you heard it only when a bullet passed close to your head.Majdi\u2019s memory of that journey is vague. He doesn\u2019t remember how long it took; he estimates that he walked for about three hours, but it could have been shorter or twice as long. Only one moment sticks out in his mind. About halfway across no man\u2019s land, Majdi was suddenly filled with a sense of joy unlike anything he had ever experienced before.\u201cI can\u2019t really describe it,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019ve never had a feeling like it since, but I was just so happy, so completely at peace with everything.\u201d He fell silent for a time, groping for an explanation. \u201cI think it\u2019s because I was in the one place where I was out from the shadow of others. I hadn\u2019t betrayed my friends yet, I hadn\u2019t betrayed my country yet \u2014 that is what lay ahead \u2014 so as long as I stayed out there, I was free.\u201dSyriaSee MapShortly after that interview, however, Syria\u2019s state-\u00adcontrolled media went silent on the whole topic. Certainly there was scant mention when, in early March, demonstrators took to the streets of the southern Syrian city Dara\u2019a to protest the arrest and reported torture of a group of high-school students for writing anti-\u00adgovernment graffiti on walls. \u201cI heard about what happened in Dara\u2019a through social media,\u201d Majd said, \u201cfrom Facebook and YouTube.\u201dIt was from the same venues that Majd learned of a solidarity protest, called the Day of Dignity, that was to take place in front of the Khaled bin al-\u00adWaleed Mosque in downtown Homs on March 18. Heeding the admonitions of his parents, Majd stayed well away from that rally, but he heard through friends that hundreds of demonstrators had shown up, watched over by a nearly equal number of police officers and state security personnel. It was a shocking story to the 18-year-old college student; Homs had simply never experienced anything like it.And that demonstration was tiny in comparison with the next, held a week later. This time, the protesters numbered in the thousands. Majd, figuring there was safety in numbers amid the throngs of onlookers, managed to get close enough to hear their demands: for political reform, greater civil rights, a repeal of the state-\u00adof-\u00ademergency edict that had been in place in Syria for the previous 48 years.On March 30, Assad delivered a speech to the Syrian Parliament, carried live by state television and radio outlets. While protests had spread to a number of Syrian cities, they were still largely peaceful, with dissenters calling for changes in the regime rather than for its overthrow. As a result \u2014 and with the assumption that the regime had learned something from the recent collapse of the Tunisian and Egyptian governments and the widening chaos in Libya \u2014 many expected Assad to take a conciliatory approach.That expectation was also based on Assad\u2019s personality. In the 11 years he had ruled the nation since the death of his father, the unassuming ophthalmologist had adopted many trappings of reform. With his attractive young wife, the British-\u00adborn Asma, he had put a pleasing, modern face on the Syrian autocracy. Behind the charm offensive, however, little had truly changed; Syria\u2019s secret police were still everywhere, and the \u201cdeep state\u201d \u2014 the country\u2019s permanent ruling class of bureaucrats and military figures \u2014 remained firmly in the hands of the Alawite minority. The Alawites, along with many in Syria\u2019s Christian minority, feared that any compromise with the protesters was to invite a Sunni revolution and, with it, their demise.After offering vague palliatives about future reform, Assad instead used his parliamentary speech to accuse the troublemakers in the streets of aiding the \u201cIsraeli enemy\u201d and to issue a stern warning. \u201cBurying sedition is a national, moral and religious duty, and all those who can contribute to burying it and do not are part of it,\u201d he declared. \u201cThere is no compromise or middle way in this.\u201d In keeping with a tradition begun during his father\u2019s reign, Assad\u2019s speech was repeatedly interrupted by members of Parliament leaping to their feet to shout out their undying love and gratitude to the president.In Majd\u2019s memory, a kind of uneasy quiet fell over Homs after Assad\u2019s address. There were still scattered protests about town, watched over by phalanxes of heavily armed security forces, but it was as if no one was quite sure what to do next \u2014 each side fearful, perhaps, of leading the nation into the kind of open warfare then roiling Libya.Then matters took an even more sinister turn. In this most religiously mixed of Syrian cities, suddenly people began turning up dead for no other discernible reason than their religious affiliation. In early November 2011, according to an unconfirmed account from Reuters, gunmen stopped a bus and murdered nine Alawite passengers. The next day, at a nearby roadblock, Syrian security forces, seemingly in retaliation, led 11 Sunni laborers off to be executed. All the while, a terror campaign of kidnappings and assassinations targeted the city\u2019s professional class, leading many of them to go into hiding or flee.The fighting also had a surreal inconstancy. Some districts saw scorched-\u00adearth battle, even as, in others, shops stayed open and the cafes were full. Throughout, Majd Ibrahim continued his hotel-\u00admanagement courses at Al-\u00adBaath University. His neighborhood, Waer, remained one of the least affected by the violence, and by carefully monitoring the news for reports of specific conflagrations, he was able on most days to navigate the two-mile journey to his campus. By February 2012, however, the combat had become so indiscriminate that the university announced it was temporarily closing. At the same time, rumors began circulating through Homs that the Syrian Army would be returning in force, this time to put down the rebellion once and for all.\u201cThat\u2019s when my parents decided to send me to Damascus,\u201d Majd explained. \u201cWith the university closed and the fighting about to get worse, they felt there was no reason for me to stay \u2014 and it was going to become especially dangerous for young men.\u201d When Majd left for the Syrian capital in early February, he passed a seemingly endless line of army transport trucks, tanks and artillery pieces parked on the shoulder of the highway just outside Homs. The next day, the Syrian Army moved in.LibyaSee Map\u201cIs your father here?\u201d Majdi asked the boy. \u201cWill you take me to your father?\u201dAt the farmhouse, he met the boy\u2019s father, a man in his 30s, who was both astonished and deeply suspicious of this stranger emerging from no man\u2019s land. Majdi repeated his cover story: that he had deserted from the regime and was trying to reach his family. He was helped in this subterfuge by his surname, for everyone in Misurata knew of the Mangoush clan. The man\u2019s wariness eased off, and he offered Majdi a lift into town.As much as he\u2019d heard about the fighting in his hometown, Majdi was unprepared for the reality. Since late February 2011, Misurata had been increasingly under siege by government forces, its residents becoming almost wholly dependent on whatever food and medical supplies could be brought in by sea. All the while, the army had rained down artillery shells, while its soldiers fought the rebels alley by alley, person by person, just as Qaddafi had promised. The siege abated somewhat with the advent of Western alliance airstrikes in late March, but the damage done to the city was staggering. Everywhere Majdi could see buildings blasted by tank shells or scorched by fire, destruction so great that in some places he couldn\u2019t even tell which street or intersection they were passing.The man from the farmhouse dropped Majdi off at his family\u2019s home. \u201cI just came through the front door,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThe first person I saw was my sister. And then there were my sister-\u00adin-\u00adlaw and my brother\u2019s children.\u201d At the memory, Majdi blinked back tears. \u201cIt had been three months. I thought I would never see them again.\u201dMajdi spent the rest of that day in reunion with his family. He learned that after his father became seriously ill, his parents had gone out aboard a medical evacuation ship to Tunisia. He also learned that the list of local \u201ctraitors\u201d to the regime didn\u2019t just consist of old friends but extended to his own family; in fact, for several weeks, his oldest brother, Mohammed, had secreted a group of deserting air force helicopter pilots in his own home. Everyone, it seemed, had joined the revolution and was now committed, after all Misurata had suffered, to see it through to the finish.At some point during this family gathering, Majdi briefly excused himself to go to his old bedroom. There, he took the Thuraya from his pocket and hid it on a shelf behind a bundle of bedding. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what I was going to do yet,\u201d he said. \u201cI just knew that I had to hide that phone.\u201dOver the next week, the returned son of Misurata wandered about his ruined city, meeting up with friends and learning of those who had been wounded or killed in battle. In the process, he came to see that everything he had been told and had believed about the war was a lie. There were no criminals, there were no foreign mercenaries \u2014 at least not among the rebels. There were only people like his own family, desperate to throw off dictatorship.But this realization placed Majdi in a very delicate spot. Ayoub, his intelligence contact, surely knew of his arrival in Misurata and was expecting him to report in. Majdi briefly entertained the idea of simply discarding the Thuraya and going on as if nothing had happened, but then he thought of the repercussions that would befall his family if the regime won out in the end. Or what if the rebels uncovered the regime\u2019s spy cell in the city and his name surfaced?Faced with these possibilities, the air force cadet came up with a far more clever \u2014 and dangerous \u2014 plan. In mid-May, he presented himself to the local rebel military council and revealed all. As Majdi well knew, for a would-be spy to throw himself on the mercy of the enemy in wartime is never a good bet \u2014 the rebels\u2019 most expedient path would be to imprison or execute him \u2014 but against this outcome, he made a bold offer.The next morning, Majdi finally contacted Ayoub, his regime handler, and agreed to meet two days later in a vacant apartment building downtown. At that meeting, a group of rebel commandos burst in with guns drawn and quickly wrestled both men to the ground. Majdi and Ayoub were then placed in different cars for transport to prison. By the time the rebel military council announced that it had captured \u201ctwo regime spies\u201d in Misurata, Majdi was already back at his family home.Although the sting had come off perfectly, there were apt to be other regime operatives aware of Majdi\u2019s assignment, making it risky for him to move about the city. He took advantage of the moment to slip off to Tunisia to visit his parents.For Majdi, then 24, the contrast of Tunisia \u2014 modern, peaceful \u2014 was yet another journey into bewilderment. \u201cIt was so quiet, so relaxed,\u201d he recalled, \u201cthat it took me some time to believe it was real.\u201dMajdi might easily have stayed on in Tunisia; it\u2019s certainly what his parents wanted. But after a few weeks, he grew restless, gnawed by a sense that his role in his country\u2019s war wasn\u2019t complete. \u201cI think part of it was a kind of revenge. I had been with the army, but they had lied and manipulated me. And, of course, the war wasn\u2019t over yet; people were still fighting and dying. I told my parents I had no choice. I had to go home.\u201dBack in Misurata, Majdi immediately became active with a local rebel militia, the Dhi Qar Brigade, for the march on Qaddafi\u2019s redoubt in Tripoli. Before he could be deployed there, however, the government forces in the capital collapsed, and the dictator and his remaining loyalists retreated down the coast to Surt, Qaddafi\u2019s tribal homeland district. There, surrounded and with their backs to the sea, they waged a desperate last stand. For a month, Majdi\u2019s unit held a stretch of the Surt bypass highway, shelling regime strongholds and engaging in the occasional firefight whenever the trapped soldiers tried to break out. As elsewhere in the Libyan war \u2014 as in most wars, frankly \u2014 combat in Surt was an oddly desultory affair, moments of intense action followed by long stretches of tedium, and to Majdi it seemed this rhythm might continue indefinitely.Instead, it ended very suddenly on Oct. 20, 2011. That morning, a fierce firefight erupted in the western part of Surt, punctuated by a series of airstrikes from Western coalition warplanes; from his perch on the bypass road, Majdi saw enormous plumes of fire and dust rising up from the bombs exploding around the city. Around 2 p.m., there came another concentrated flurry of small-arms fire from the western suburbs, one that lasted about 20 minutes, before all fell quiet. Initially, Majdi and his comrades thought it meant that Qaddafi\u2019s men had surrendered, but there soon came even better news: The dictator himself had been captured and killed. \u201cWe all cheered and hugged each other,\u201d Majdi recalled, \u201cbecause we knew it meant the war was over. After all that killing \u2014 and after 42 years of Qaddafi \u2014 a new day had finally come to Libya.\u201dWith the fighting at an end, Majdi returned to Misurata and transferred to a militia unit more suited to his gentle character: an ambulance crew ferrying the more severely war-\u00adwounded from Misurata\u2019s hospitals to the airport for advanced medical treatment abroad. He greatly enjoyed this work, which he felt showed tangible evidence of recovery after so much death and devastation, and it fortified his optimism about the future.Then one December day at the Misurata airport, Majdi received a visitor. He was Sameh al-\u00adDrisi, the older brother of his friend Jalal, and he had traveled the 500 miles from Benghazi to ask a favor. The Libyan revolution had been over for two months, but the last time anyone in the Drisi family had heard from Jalal was in May. That communication was a short phone call from the Tripoli high school where the air force cadets had been sequestered, and it came just days after Majdi left for his spying mission to Misurata.Changing course once again, Majdi set out in search of his lost friend with a tenacity that bordered on obsession. Returning to Tripoli, he spent weeks tracking down some of their former academy classmates and, from them, was able to piece together at least part of the mystery. In May 2011, Jalal had been among a group of some 50 cadets at the Tripoli high school who were assembled and told they were being sent to assist front-line troops as they advanced on the rebels in Misurata, checking for old booby-\u00adtraps and guarding communication and supply lines. Instead, the cadets were used as bait there, sent out over open ground to be shot and shelled at, while the regime\u2019s more seasoned soldiers sat back to observe where the enemy fire was coming from. As one cadet after another fell on this suicide mission, Jalal and two of his comrades managed to reach an outlying farm, where they begged an old farmer to take them south, away from the battlefield; instead, the farmer betrayed the students and delivered them to internal security forces, who in turn delivered them right back to the army. After a round of beatings, the three were sent back to their suicide squad.But that was as far as the tale went. Shortly after, Jalal\u2019s two companions had made a second escape attempt \u2014 this time successfully \u2014 but by then Jalal had been moved to a different part of the front.This set Majdi off on a new search. He finally found another former classmate who completed the story. One day in June, a small group of the cadets \u2014 Jalal and others who had managed to survive that long \u2014 were bivouacked along a farm road on Misurata\u2019s southern outskirts when an officer drove up and called the students over for a situation report. In that same moment, a missile from an unseen Western alliance warplane or drone blew apart the officer\u2019s car, instantly killing him and most of the cadets standing nearby. When the missile struck, Jalal was sitting beneath a tree some 50 yards away, but it was there that an errant piece of shrapnel found him, tearing off the top of his head. His surviving companions buried Jalal\u2019s spilled brain beneath the tree but put his corpse in a truck with the other dead for transport to some unknown cemetery.\u201cOf course I was reminded of the dream he\u2019d had,\u201d Majdi said. \u201cYes, we\u2019d both gone to Misurata to fight, but it was he who died.\u201dFor most people, this might have meant an end to the search, but not Majdi. Recalling the time he had spent with Jalal\u2019s family in Benghazi, the hospitality they had shown him, he was determined to find his friend\u2019s body so that it might be returned to them. After knocking on the doors of countless functionaries in the new revolutionary government, he was finally directed to a Tripoli cemetery where the \u201ctraitors\u201d \u2014 that is, Qaddafi regime loyalists \u2014 had been gathered up and buried.It was a grim, trash-\u00adstrewn stretch of land dotted with hundreds of graves. Majdi methodically passed down each row, but Jalal\u2019s name wasn\u2019t listed. Finally, he came to a far corner of the cemetery where he saw a grave marked \u201cunknown.\u201d Majdi felt a burst of excitement, for it occurred to him that given Jalal\u2019s terrible head wound, identification might have been impossible \u2014 but then he noticed three more graves with the same \u201cunknown\u201d markers. Returning to the cemetery office, he asked for the photographs taken of the unidentified corpses before burial: The faces of all four were so horribly damaged as to be unrecognizable.Still, Majdi was now convinced that one of the four was Jalal. He broke the news to the Drisi family and several months later flew to Benghazi to pay his respects to them in person. \u201cIt was a very emotional meeting,\u201d he said, \u201cand I apologized to them for not being able to watch out for Jalal, but. ...\u201d He drifted off in sadness for a moment, but then abruptly righted himself. \u201cSo that is it. Jalal is in one of those four graves, that is for sure.\u201dSyriaSee MapMajd had kept in regular contact with his parents and friends during his Damascus stay, so he knew that the fighting in Homs had been centered in the Baba Amr neighborhood south of downtown. He\u2019d been told that the damage was extensive, but he wasn\u2019t prepared for the reality. \u201cWe drove past it on the day I got back,\u201d he recalled, \u201cand \u2014 well, it was just gone. Everything was gone. I remember thinking \u2014 trying to find something positive, you know? \u2014 Everyone should come see this. If people saw Baba Amr now, maybe it would be a lesson. They would understand how terrible war is.\u201d The na\u00efvet\u00e9 of that notion soon became obvious; within weeks of Majd\u2019s return, the battle for Homs started up in earnest again. This time, the regime was targeting the insurgents in the Khalidiya neighborhood, and because the army\u2019s main artillery staging ground was next to the Waer district, it meant shells passed directly over the Ibrahims\u2019 apartment building at all hours.\u201cWhen they went overhead,\u201d Majd said, \u201cit was like the air was sucked away. I don\u2019t know how else to describe it, but you felt it in your lungs. It was hard to breathe for maybe a half-\u00adminute afterward, like all the oxygen was gone.\u201dThe fighting in Homs raged on through the summer of 2012, with the Syrian military methodically targeting one rebel-\u00adheld neighborhood after another, their ground-troop assaults backed up by tanks, artillery and helicopter gunships. Throughout, though, the middle-\u00adclass neighborhood of Waer remained an oasis of comparative calm. Majd attributed it to Waer\u2019s diversity; with its mixed population of Sunnis, Alawites and Christians, none of the rebel militias could truly control the enclave \u2014 and if the militias weren\u2019t there in force, the overextended Syrian Army couldn\u2019t be bothered.By the autumn of 2012, that began to change. On the streets of Waer, Majd noticed more and more young men toting weapons, and of those who wore insignia, by far the most common was that of the Free Syrian Army, or F.S.A. The militiamen also took notice of Majd. Of perfect combat age at 20, he found his daily ventures to the university growing ever more stressful as the gunmen demanded to know who he was allied with or taunted him for not \u201cjoining up.\u201dIn response to the growing tension in Waer, the Ibrahims began renting a \u201cshelter home\u201d \u2014 a safety measure that many of the city\u2019s more affluent residents were adopting. By now, so many families had fled Homs that furnished apartments sat empty throughout the city. Contacting one such family that had left for Damascus, Majd\u2019s father arranged to rent their apartment in an outlying neighborhood for use whenever trouble cropped up in Waer. At first, the Ibrahims decamped to their shelter home only occasionally, but by early 2013 their flights had increased in frequency to two or three times a week. Their greatest concern was for the safety of their eldest son at the hands of the militias.\u201cMost of them were just guys from the neighborhood who\u2019d managed to get their hands on some guns,\u201d Majd explained. \u201cI knew a lot of them \u2014 I\u2019d grown up with them \u2014 so that was good. But more and more were coming in from the outside, and those guys were tough. A lot of them were survivors of the battles in Baba Amr and Khalidiya. They were suspicious of everyone, and you just never knew what they were going to do.\u201dAdding another unsettling element to the mix, a lot of the fighters were on drugs, habitually popping an amphetamine called Captagon that could keep them alert for days, counteracted by an anti-\u00adanxiety drug called Zolam to bring them down.Of all the various armed groups that had pitched up in Waer \u2014 and many were little more than neighborhood self-\u00addefense committees \u2014 the Free Syrian Army spurred a particular disdain in Majd. While many in American foreign-\u00adpolicy circles were professing to see secular progressives who, if supported, might lead Syria to democracy, Majd saw only a bunch of opportunists and cowards.\u201cAt least the guys in the Islamist groups had some beliefs and discipline,\u201d he said, \u201cbut most of the F.S.A. in Waer were just young guys who wanted to walk around with guns and scare people. And the funny thing about that is they were the ones who scared very easily. If another group came into their area, they would just turn around and join that group.\u201dLibyaSee Map\u201cAnd we were just students,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s all we were. Both sides used us. Both sides slaughtered us.\u201dDespite all this, Majdi was initially very optimistic about the future in post-\u00adrevolutionary Libya; the country had oil, smart people and, after the 42-year reign of Col. Muammar el-\u00adQaddafi, the will for a better life. In his view, the first great misstep was when the interim government in Tripoli, the Transitional National Council, announced that it would pay stipends to all those who had fought against the Qaddafi regime. Within weeks, the number of \u201crevolutionaries\u201d \u2014 approximately 20,000 by the most generous estimate \u2014 had mushroomed to some 250,000. Worse, the structure of the compensation, acquiesced to by Western governments allied with the transitional council, created an incentive for new armed groups not just to form but to remain independent of any central command, the better to demand their own share of the compensation pie. Already by the close of 2012, Libyan militias \u2014 some composed of true revolutionary veterans, others no more than tribal or criminal gangs \u2014 had begun carving the country into rival fiefs, their ability to do so bankrolled by the very central government that they were undermining. That instability was made painfully clear to the Obama administration when the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi was attacked in September 2012, leading to the deaths of Ambassador J.Christopher Stevens and three others. But for Majdi, final disillusionment took a more personal form. In the autumn of 2012, he received his \u201cdiploma\u201d from the air force academy, announcing that he had successfully completed all the requirements for a degree in communication engineering.\u201cI hadn\u2019t completed anything,\u201d he said. \u201cThere had been no classes for a year and a half, so this paper was absolutely meaningless. But this was the new Libya: Everything was just lies and corruption. And maybe I felt it more because of what I had gone through, all my friends at the academy who had been killed, but I just couldn\u2019t accept that. \u2018Here, take this paper. No one has to know. Call yourself an engineer.\u2019 Maybe others felt it in a different way, or they think of it more in political terms, but it was when I received my diploma that I saw the revolution had been betrayed, that Libya was a failed state.\u201dMajdi faced a stark choice: He could use his sham diploma to land some inconsequential government job, or he could start over. The next year, he enrolled in Misurata University to study engineering. Around the time he started back at school, Majdi also became involved with an environmental group based in Tripoli called Tree Lovers. He was so inspired by its work that he helped start a Misurata branch. While both money and supplies are tight, Majdi and other volunteers have planted flowers and shrubs along many of the city\u2019s dusty median strips and sought to raise awareness about the importance of preserving the very little vegetation Libya possesses. \u201cThe desert is spreading in lots of places in Libya,\u201d he said, \u201cand the only way to stop that is with trees.\u201dBut there may have been a more personal impulse at work on Majdi. One of the more intriguing phenomena observed among ex-\u00adsoldiers most everywhere is a desire for solitude, to be out in nature, and when I visited him in Misurata, Majdi was eager to show me the forest that he and his fellow conservationists tended. On an early morning, we drove out of Misurata for the farm fields and small villages at its southern outskirts.Majdi\u2019s \u201cforest\u201d proved to be little more than a few rows of scraggly pines set beside a farm road, with trash strewn about from careless picnickers, but he was very proud of it. Stepping around the garbage, he strolled among the trees and breathed in deeply of the pine scent with a satisfied smile.EgyptSee Map\u201cSo what to do?\u201d Laila asked rhetorically. \u201cMorsi was completely unacceptable, but now it was him or Shafik, so we were stuck. Well, never Shafik \u2014 that meant a return to the Mubarak era \u2014 so. ...\u201dIn just this way, Laila Soueif, the stalwart feminist and leftist, found herself backing the election of a man who advocated returning Egypt to traditional Islamic values. Many other Egyptians were aghast at the choice given to them; in the June runoff, Morsi barely squeaked in with 51.7 percent of the vote.In his inaugural speech on June 30, Morsi promised that \u201cin the new Egypt, the president will be an employee, a servant to the people.\u201d But a servant to the deep state may have been more accurate. Just days before the new president assumed office, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, or SCAF, the military junta that had ruled Egypt since Mubarak\u2019s overthrow, transferred most presidential powers to the military. That followed a decree by the Supreme Constitutional Court, a holdover from the Mubarak era, that dissolved a sitting Parliament dominated by the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist political parties. On the day he assumed office, then, Morsi was barely more than a figurehead, the public face to a democracy already gutted.Morsi tried mightily to claw back the authority taken from his office. Ignoring the fiat of the Supreme Constitutional Court, he ordered the dissolved Islamist-\u00addominated Parliament reinstated. Even more boldly, he dismissed the senior military leadership, including the powerful defense minister. In his place, Morsi promoted his own man, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the general who had lectured Ahmed Seif during his 2011 detention.But then Morsi overreached \u2014 badly. In October 2012, he tried to expand the powers of the presidency by decree, a move that alarmed both the deep state and the secular opposition, already growing increasingly fearful of creeping Islamization. Morsi swiftly reeled back some of the more controversial planks in his decree, but the damage was done; in a new round of protests across Egypt, the president was denounced for trying to become a new \u201cpharaoh\u201d or \u201cayatollah.\u201dAnd here was the opening the deep state seemed to have been waiting for, the chance to reopen the traditional schism that existed between its Islamist and secular opponents. For decades, the Egyptian generals had held up the Islamists \u2014 and most particularly the Muslim Brotherhood \u2014 as the greatest threat to the modern secular state and naturally positioned themselves as the guardians against them. This strategy had broken down during the heady days of revolution, with Islamists and progressives alike turning against the generals, but Ahmed Seif had seen how easily it could be resurrected. At a meeting of human rights activists organized by Amnesty International the year before, when Egypt was still under the control of the SCAF generals, one attendee after another expressed concern about the possibility of an Islamist electoral victory. As Scott Long, an activist who was at the meeting, recalled on his personal blog, the normally soft-\u00adspoken Ahmed finally slapped his hand against the conference table. \u201cI will not accept that the American government, or Amnesty, or anyone, will tell me that I need to tolerate a military dictatorship in order to avoid a takeover by Islamist people,\u201d he said. \u201cI will not accept such false choices.\u201dNow, with Morsi\u2019s overreach as president, that \u201cfalse choice\u201d was becoming increasingly stark.\u201cIt was very clear what the state was doing,\u201d Laila said. \u201cFirst, block everything that Morsi tries to do, so that nothing gets done. \u2018He\u2019s a failed president.\u2019 But second, feed the fears about him. That was easy to do, because the propaganda against the Muslim Brotherhood \u2014 \u2018They\u2019re terrorists\u2019 \u2014 went back 50 years,\u201d and the propaganda had at least some basis in reality: In the 1990s, factions of the Muslim Brotherhood had formed alliances with actual terrorists groups.By the spring of 2013, Egypt was becoming rapidly polarized between Morsi\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood followers and nearly everyone else. Perversely, many of the same young demonstrators who took to the streets in 2011 to demand democracy were now calling for Morsi\u2019s overthrow. Even more perversely, they looked to the one state institution capable of carrying that out: the Egyptian military.This wasn\u2019t simply a case of national amnesia. One of the more curious aspects of Egyptian society has been a longstanding reverence for its military, a tradition inculcated in Egyptian students from primary school. As a result, even during Mubarak\u2019s era, many Egyptians regarded the military as somehow apart from the venal dictatorship it upheld. Nevermind that the army was, in fact, a major beneficiary of that corrupt system \u2014 the Egyptian military owned construction companies, engineering firms, even a pasta factory \u2014 what a lot of those who took to the streets in anti-\u00adMorsi demonstrations in 2013 recalled was that the army had been instrumental in finally toppling Mubarak two years before. If the guardians of the nation had acted to overthrow one dictator, why not a second one in the making?\u201cYou could see what was about to happen,\u201d Laila said. \u201cYes, Morsi was a disaster, he had to go, but to invite in the military was worse. But so many people I knew, even people who had been in Tahrir, this is what they wanted.\u201dOn June 30, 2013, the first anniversary of Morsi\u2019s inauguration, huge demonstrations took place throughout Egypt, with protesters demanding that he step down. They were met in the streets by counter\u00addemonstrations of Morsi\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood supporters. All but invisible between these two great factions was a small group of protesters advocating a third path. It included Laila Soueif and her daughter, Mona.\u201cWe gathered in one corner near Tahrir,\u201d Mona recalled with a rueful laugh, \u201cand chanted, \u2018Not Morsi, and not the army.\u2019 People going by gave us these confused looks, like we were all crazy, and I\u2019m sure we kind of seemed that way.\u201dIt was at this critical juncture that the defense minister, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, until then regarded as a bland functionary, finally stepped from the shadows. On July 1, the general delivered an ultimatum to the man who had appointed him, giving Morsi 48 hours \u201cto meet the demands of the people\u201d or the army would step in to restore order. Pointing out that he was the elected head of state, the president defiantly dismissed the threat.\u201cMorsi made two great mistakes,\u201d Laila said. \u201cFirst, he thought the army wouldn\u2019t move against him without the approval of the Americans. He didn\u2019t realize the generals didn\u2019t care about the Americans anymore. Second, he trusted Sisi.\u201dTrue to his word, on July 3, Sisi overthrew the Egyptian government. He also annulled the Constitution, arrested Morsi and other Muslim Brotherhood leaders and shut down four television stations. Within days, he announced the formation of an interim \u201ctransitional\u201d government, one composed of military officers and Mubarak-\u00adera apparatchiks, but all Egyptians knew that the real authority now lay with Sisi.It was on the streets of Egypt where the face of the new regime was most nakedly revealed. In the days after Sisi took power, clashes between his supporters and those of the ousted president turned increasingly violent, with the police and the military making very clear whose side they were on. On July 8, security forces fired on Morsi loyalists gathered in central Cairo, killing at least 51. That episode set the stage for far worse. On the afternoon of Aug. 14, security forces moved in to Cairo\u2019s Rabaa Square with orders to disperse the several thousand Morsi holdout supporters who had been camped there during the previous month. By the most reliable estimates, at least 800 and perhaps more than 1,000 protesters were killed in the ensuing massacre. In an obscene parody of the 2011 revolution, hundreds took to Cairo\u2019s streets over the following days to praise the army for its actions.For Laila Soueif, there was to be another, far more personal indication that the new Egyptian regime was different from those that had come before.Laila\u2019s son, Alaa, bore the dubious distinction of having been arrested by all three Egyptian governments that preceded Sisi\u2019s takeover: those of Mubarak, SCAF and Morsi. In 2006, he spent 45 days in jail for joining a demonstration calling for greater judicial independence. During the SCAF administration, he did a two-month stint in detention for \u201cinciting violence.\u201d He fared better under Morsi, if only because the judges, Mubarak-\u00adera holdovers, detested the new president; his March 2013 charge of \u201cinciting aggression\u201d was summarily dismissed, while his conviction for arson resulted in a one-year suspended sentence.Given this track record, it was probably just a matter of time before Alaa was picked up by the new Egyptian regime. That occurred on Nov. 28, 2013, when he was arrested on charges of inciting violence and, in a nice Orwellian touch, protesting an anti-\u00adprotest law enacted just four days earlier. That note of black humor aside, under the rule of Sisi, matters were to play out very differently for Laila\u2019s son from the way they had in the past.Refugees coming from Libya at the border near Ben Gardane, March 2011.Near Ben Gardane, March 2011.Near Ben Gardane, March 2011.Near Ben Gardane, March 2011.Near Ben Gardane, March 2011.On a bus near Ben Gardane, March 2011.Near Ben Gardane, March 2011.SyriaSee MapThat dynamic ended in early May 2013. In a colossal misstep, the Free Syrian Army had recently moved back into the devastated Baba Amr neighborhood, and there had been surrounded and slaughtered. Those who managed to escape the regime\u2019s cordon made for Waer and took near total control of the enclave. Sure enough, Syrian army artillery shells soon began raining down on Majd\u2019s neighborhood. While the scale of shelling was nothing like what befell Baba Amr or Khalidiya, it was enough to keep the Ibrahim family in their fourth-floor apartment, forever trying to guess where safety lay.\u201cYou just never knew what to do,\u201d Majd explained. \u201cIs it better here or in the shelter home? And if it\u2019s safer there, how dangerous is it to try to get there?\u201dAs bizarre as it might seem, one reason the Ibrahims stayed on in Homs despite the ever-\u00adworsening situation was that Majd\u2019s finals were coming up at the university. Their insistence on his finishing was not some homage to the value of higher education; under Syrian law, college students were exempt from conscription, so as long as Majd stayed in school, he was safe from being drafted. Once he took his exams at the end of July, his parents decided, they would reassess the situation and decide what came next.That gamble nearly led to disaster. On the afternoon of July 5, Majd was talking with friends on a Waer street when a white station wagon pulled up and three young F.S.A. fighters with Kalashnikovs jumped out. Grabbing Majd, they dragged him into the car where, blindfolded, he was driven to their nearby base.\u201cI thought it was a joke at the beginning,\u201d Majd said. \u201cBut they knew my name, my age, what I was studying in the university. They wanted me, not anyone else.\u201dFor the next few hours, Majd\u2019s captors insisted that he admit to being a regime spy, meeting protestations of innocence with kicks and punches. Finally, he was forced to his knees, and an F.S.A. man put a large knife to his throat. Another aimed a Kalashnikov at his head.\u201cWell, this is the standard way they execute,\u201d Majd said softly, \u201cso I knew this was about to happen to me. They wanted to kill me very badly.\u201dIn prelude to his execution, however, the chief interrogator thought to look through Majd\u2019s cellphone. With each phone number and photograph he flipped to, he demanded that Majd finally give up the identity of his \u201ccontroller.\u201d The 20-year-old\u2019s continued professions of innocence brought more kicks, more punches. The interrogator came to the stored photograph of one young man in particular and stopped.\u201cWhy do you have this guy\u2019s photo?\u201d he asked.\u201cBecause he\u2019s my best friend,\u201d Majd replied.The F.S.A. commander slowly turned to his captive. \u201cWe will call him.\u201dThe commander left the room, and for a long time Majd remained on his knees, the knife to his throat and the gun to his head. Quite unbeknown to Majd, his best friend was also an acquaintance of the F.S.A. commander, and he came to the base to assure the militiaman that Majd Ibrahim was no regime spy. Majd learned this only when the commander returned to the interrogation room and told him he would be set free.\u201cSo that is what saved my life,\u201d Majd said, \u201cthat photograph.\u201dDuring the drive back to Waer, the F.S.A. commander started a long sales pitch on why Majd should quit the university and take up arms against the regime. Majd said he would think about it.When he arrived at the spot where he had been picked up earlier that day, his parents and friends were waiting for him. The next morning, July 6, the Ibrahim family left for their shelter home, never to return to the Waer neighborhood where Majd had lived his entire life. It was his 21st birthday.JordanSee MapKhulood\u2019s work at KnK had undergone a shift, though. With the war in Iraq having abated, the number of Iraqi refugees in Jordan was drastically reduced from its half-\u00admillion peak. They were soon replaced, however, by new refugees from the war in Syria \u2014 just a trickle at first, but by the end of 2014, their number was more than 600,000.In certain ways, Khulood found the Syrian children quite different from their Iraqi counterparts. \u201cThe Iraqis, because they had become so tired of war, they were very peaceful and easy to work with,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the Syrian children \u2014 the boys \u2014 they have this idea, \u2018We have to go back to Syria to fight.\u2019 They hear this constantly from their fathers \u2014 \u2018You\u2019re going to be a soldier and go back to Syria\u2019 \u2014 so they\u2019re like little rebels, not little kids. It\u2019s all about home, missing home, how they need to go back and avenge what happened.\u201d By contrast, the girls had far more in common. \u201cIn both Iraq and Syria, girls are taught to keep everything inside. They aren\u2019t listened to. This makes it much harder to reach them, so their problems are deeper.\u201dKhulood still hadn\u2019t given up on her quest to get her family out of the region. For several years, she continued to petition for the United States to reopen their case, but those efforts went nowhere. By 2014, she was holding out special hope for Britain; in Jordan, she had worked as an interpreter for a British film company, and with letters of support from her former co-\u00adworkers, Khulood reasoned, the authorities there might look favorably on her. She had recently become aware of a rather diabolical Catch-22, however. Nearly the only way to win asylum in Britain \u2014 or in any other country, for that matter \u2014 was to present the petition in person. To do that, Khulood first needed to obtain a British visa, and to get that, she needed to have legal residency in Jordan. \u201cAnd that\u2019s impossible,\u201d she said. \u201cJordan only gives residency to wealthy refugees who, of course, have no problem resettling in Europe anyway.\u201dStill, in April 2014, Khulood hadn\u2019t completely given up hope. Possessed of a seemingly unconquerable will, over several days of conversation, she seemed determined to put the very best face on her situation, and she was far more interested in talking up her current plans than her past failures. Only once did this brave facade crack, and it came amid a discussion about the future she imagined for the refugee children she worked with.\u201cI stay with this because I want these kids to have a better life than me,\u201d she said, \u201cbut frankly, I think their lives will be wasted just like mine. I try not to think that way, but, really, let\u2019s be candid: This is their future. For me, these past nine years have been wasted. My sisters and I, we have dreams. We are educated, we want to study, to have careers. But in Jordan we cannot legally work, and we cannot leave, so we are just standing in place. That\u2019s all. Now we\u2019re becoming old, we\u2019re all in our 30s, but still we can\u2019t marry or start families, because then we will never get out of here.\u201dKhulood sat back and let out a dispirited sigh. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I try to never pity myself or to blame anyone for this situation, but I really wish the Americans had thought more about what they were doing before they came to Iraq. That\u2019s what started all this. Without that, we would be normal.\u201dBut for Khulood and her sisters, the situation was about to grow even worse. In the autumn of 2014, Khulood said, KnK was having problems with the Jordanian government, which insisted that the organization\u2019s foreign staff members have legal work permits. While KnK said the sisters\u2019 work was exemplary, its efforts to keep them were in vain; that December, all three Zaidi sisters were dismissed from their jobs on the same day.EgyptSee Map\u201cThe idea wasn\u2019t to kill ourselves,\u201d Laila explained, \u201cbut to draw attention to what the Sisi regime was doing. It was the only weapon we had left.\u201d As for its efficacy, she was matter-\u00adof-\u00adfact. \u201cA few people passing signaled that they supported us \u2014 sometimes quite a subtle signal.\u201dAdding another layer of pain to the experience, it came at a time when Laila\u2019s family had, quite literally, disappeared before her eyes.The first sign that the Sisi regime was to take a much dimmer view than its predecessors of dissent to its rule came with Alaa\u2019s arrest in late November 2013. Rather than being released on bail to await trial, he and his 24 co-\u00addefendants were held for the next four months. In a tactic apparently designed to break his will, Alaa\u2019s release on bail in March 2014 was followed by his rearrest three months later.If average Egyptians were alarmed by the deepening repression in their country \u2014 less than a year after Sisi took power, there were already far more political prisoners in Egypt\u2019s jails than there had ever been under Mubarak \u2014 they gave scant evidence of it. In presidential elections that May, Sisi, now officially retired from the military, won with more than 96 percent of the vote. While this surely wasn\u2019t a wholly accurate reflection of his popularity \u2014 between those political parties that had been banned and those that boycotted the election, Sisi faced only token opposition \u2014 even an ardent opponent like Laila Soueif recognized that the former general had widespread support. She had even seen it among many of her friends and university co-\u00adworkers. \u201cThey had this idea that, \u2018O.K., maybe he\u2019s a little rough, but he saved us from the Islamists,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s all they cared about, all they saw.\u201dUp to that point, Laila\u2019s youngest daughter, Sanaa, then 20, had avoided the family tradition of run-ins with the law. On June 21, 2014, that changed. Increasingly infuriated by the treatment of her brother and Egypt\u2019s other political prisoners, Sanaa joined a human rights rally in Cairo. Within minutes, she was arrested on the same charge as her brother: violating the protest law.Even under the tightening Sisi regime, members of the Cairene upper class like Sanaa enjoyed a degree of immunity \u2014 the main enemies of the state, after all, were the working-\u00adclass followers of the Muslim Brotherhood, and they were to be ruthlessly hunted down. But when brought before a magistrate, the college student took a bold step. Despite suggestions from the judge that she stay quiet, Sanaa insisted that she had been a chief organizer of the demonstration and refused to sign her statement until this detail was included. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t going to let them do the usual thing of letting the high-\u00adprofile activists go and pound on the lesser-\u00adknown ones,\u201d Laila said. Sanaa, like her older brother, was held in jail pending trial.For Ahmed Seif, Egypt\u2019s pre-\u00ademinent human rights lawyer, it had meant that his ever-\u00adexpanding roster of clients now included two of his own children. At a news conference the previous January, the former political prisoner took the microphone to eloquently address his imprisoned son, Alaa. \u201cI wanted you to inherit a democratic society that guards your rights, my son, but instead I passed on the prison cell that held me, and now holds you.\u201d By June, that haunting message applied equally to his youngest daughter.Soon, matters took an even grimmer turn for the family of Laila Soueif. Long in frail health, Ahmed had been scheduled for open-\u00adheart surgery at the end of August; on the 16th of that month, he suddenly collapsed and then fell into a coma. Only after intense lobbying by both influential Egyptians and international human rights organizations did the Sisi regime grant Alaa and Sanaa afternoon furloughs to visit their father before he died.\u201cAnd that was the absolute worst day,\u201d Laila said, \u201cmaybe the worst day of my life. Sanaa was being held in a police station, so we had been able to see her and tell her what was going on, but Alaa had no idea. He showed up at the hospital with flowers for Ahmed, so I had to take him aside to say his father was in a coma. He said, \u2018So he won\u2019t even know I\u2019m here then\u2019 and just threw the flowers out.\u201dThe day after that hospital visit, Alaa went on a hunger strike in his cell. Sanaa stopped eating also, on Aug. 28, the day of her father\u2019s funeral. A week later, Laila and Mona announced their partial hunger strike, in which they would take only anti-\u00addehydration liquids.In light of both Ahmed\u2019s death and the family\u2019s prominence, many observers believed that Alaa and Sanaa would be shown leniency by the courts. That belief was misplaced. On Oct. 26, 2014, Sanaa was sentenced to three years in prison for violating the protest law. The next day, Laila and Mona took to the courthouse steps for their intensified hunger strike. Laila braced herself for more bad news when Alaa went to trial the following month, by remembering something her husband had said.\u201cBecause Ahmed had spent so much time in courtrooms and knew what certain things meant,\u201d she said, \u201che was always very accurate in his predictions. Before he died, when he was still representing Alaa, he told me, \u2018Prepare yourself, because they\u2019re going to give him five years.\u2019 \u201dSyriaSee MapWith the serial siege of Homs steadily grinding ever more of the city\u2019s neighborhoods to dust, by early 2014 even the Ibrahim family\u2019s shelter home was no longer safe. That March, the family moved once again, this time to New Akrama, a neighborhood that had been spared the worst of the violence. There, they simply waited along with everyone else for something, anything, to change.That change finally came in May, when the last of Homs\u2019 rebels accepted a brokered cease-fire and safe passage from the city. The three-year siege of Homs was over. What had once been a thriving, cosmopolitan city was now known as Syria\u2019s Stalingrad, with vast expanses of its neighborhoods uninhabitable. It was also only then that the full horror of what some of its residents had been subjected to came to light. In the total-war environment, some residents had starved to death, while others had survived by eating leaves and weeds.But even if a kind of peace had reached the shattered streets of Homs, the war continued elsewhere in Syria, and in a form that boded poorly for all its citizens. Majd Ibrahim heard the names of so many new militias competing with the plethora of already existing ones, it was quite impossible to keep track of them all. For sheer daring and cruelty, however, one group stood out: the Islamic State, or ISIS.An even more radical offshoot of Al Qaeda, the newcomers attracted Islamic extremists from around the world. In Syria, the group announced its presence with a series of sudden, brutal attacks in Aleppo and the desert towns to the east, battling not just the Syrian Army but also those rival militias it deemed \u201capostate.\u201d What most drew the attention of Majd Ibrahim was the group\u2019s reputation for complete mercilessness, for eliminating by the most horrific means possible any who would resist its will.Just a month after the Homs siege ended, most of the rest of the world would hear of ISIS, too, when it stormed out of the Syrian desert to utterly transform the Middle Eastern battlefield yet again.TKIraqSee MapBy the time he was a teenager, Wakaz had joined the legions of other unskilled young Iraqi men who scraped by with day-labor construction jobs: hauling bricks, cutting rebar, mixing cement. When no construction work was to be had, he sometimes helped out in the small candy shop that his father, a retired bank clerk, had opened in Dawr, his home village just outside Tikrit. But it was all a rather meager and dull existence.There was one potential way out. In stark contrast to Wakaz\u2019s own middling ability to find employment, his oldest brother, Mohammed, had been hired as an intelligence officer for the local security forces, and this sinecure held out considerable promise for the entire Hassan family. Given the culture of nepotism that Sad\u00addam Hussein had fostered in Iraq, and which continued to flourish after his demise, Wakaz could reasonably hope that Mohammed might someday work his way far enough up into the munici\u00adpal ranks to bring his three younger brothers, including himself, into the security forces as well. But in June 2014, a series of cataclysmic events were about to break over the Sunni heartland of Iraq, and they would radically alter the fortunes of the 19-year-old day laborer in Dawr.At the very beginning of that year, ISIS insurgents wrested control of the crucial crossroads city of Falluja in Iraq\u2019s Anbar Province, then spread out to seize a number of nearby cities and towns. At the time, Wakaz knew very little about the group, other than that it sought to establish an Islamic caliphate in the Sunni lands of Iraq and Syria. Over subsequent months, however, Wakaz, like most other young Tikriti men, had seen the elaborate recruitment videos that ISIS produced and distributed on social media. The videos depicted warriors, or \u201cknights,\u201d as ISIS called them, clad in smartly turned-out uniforms and black ski masks as they rode triumphantly through towns they had conquered, great black flags flapping from their new Toyota Land Cruisers. Other videos from that time showed a decidedly darker side of ISIS \u2014 executions and crucifixion displays \u2014 but Wakaz claimed never to have seen those. In any event, the budding caliphate seemed far away from the sleepy and economically moribund town of Dawr.By that June, it was far away no more. On June 6, a band of ISIS fighters entered the western suburbs of Mosul, northern Iraq\u2019s largest city, just 140 miles up Highway 1 from Tikrit. Although it\u2019s estimated that a mere 1,500 ISIS fighters participated in the attack on Mosul \u2014 and by some accounts, the number was far lower \u2014 within a couple of days, they had put the tens of thousands of Iraqi Army and security forces in the city of two million to panicked flight. By June 9, the Highway 1 bypass road around Tikrit was the scene of a frantic stampede as thousands of Iraqi soldiers, many having already shed their uniforms, sped for the safety of Baghdad, 100 miles farther south. But ISIS wasn\u2019t done. After Mosul, they quickly advanced on Baiji, the oil-refinery town 40 miles north of Tikrit, and then on June 11 rolled into Tikrit itself.In Tikrit, just as in Mosul and Baiji, the Iraqi Army offered virtually nothing in the way of resistance, with different units seeming only to compete on how quickly they could escape and how much of their weaponry they could leave behind for the enemy. But if the army fled the region, few of the local people did. Those remaining behind included Wakaz and his brother Mohammed.The ISIS offensive of June 2014 marked one of the most stunning military feats in modern history: In less than one week, a lightly armed guerrilla force of, ultimately, perhaps 5,000 fighters scattered a modern and well-equipped army at least 20 times its size, capturing billions of dollars worth of advanced weaponry and military hardware, and now controlled population centers that totaled some five million people. While such a colossal collapse as that experienced by the Iraqi Army must necessarily be a result of many failures \u2014 certainly, incompetence and corruption played major roles \u2014 much of it could be attributed to recent history.Under the eight-year rule of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, Iraq\u2019s Shiite majority had come to dominate most every aspect of the national government, including its military, and to lord their newfound primacy over the Sunnis. For many residents in the Sunni heartland \u2014 and this included Baiji and Tikrit \u2014 this heavy-handed treatment spawned a deep contempt for both the central government and its army, whom they regarded as occupiers. Of course, that Shiite-dominated army was well aware of the locals\u2019 contempt and deeply distrusted them in turn, to such an extent that at the first sign of trouble \u2014 in this case, a few Sunni jihadists riding into town vowing vengeance \u2014 the soldiers, fearing a mass uprising against them, simply bolted.This was not a completely unfounded fear, because ISIS had cleverly established sleeper cells in these cities ahead of time, both to begin attacks when the battle was joined and to recruit new members to the cause. Among those recruits was Wakaz Hassan.According to Wakaz, he joined ISIS on June 10, 2014, just as the guerrilla group became active in the Tikrit area but a full day before its attacks there began in earnest. His chief recruiter, he claimed, was none other than his brother, the 26-year-old American-trained and Iraqi-government-employed intelligence officer Mohammed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t for religion,\u201d Wakaz maintained, \u201cand it wasn\u2019t as if I had any emotional connection to the group \u2014 at that point, I didn\u2019t really know what they were fighting for \u2014 but because Mohammed said we should join.\u201dOmitted from Wakaz\u2019s account was the matter of money. By the summer of 2014, ISIS was so flush with funds from its control of the oil fields of eastern Syria that it could offer even untrained foot soldiers up to $400 a month for enlisting \u2014 vastly more than an unskilled 19-year-old like Wakaz could make from pickup construction jobs. Of course, having now also seized the Baiji oil refinery, ISIS stood to turn its financial spigot into a geyser.As pledging members of ISIS, Mohammed and Wakaz assisted in the seizing of Tikrit on June 11. The brothers also played at least a supporting role in the most horrific atrocity to occur during ISIS\u2019 June blitzkrieg.Just to the north of Tikrit is a large Iraqi military training base still known by its American name: Camp Speicher. Thousands of cadets were undergoing training there when ISIS closed in. As might have been predicted from the conduct of Iraqi soldiers elsewhere, the regular army units and senior military command garrisoned at Speicher simply fled the compound at word of ISIS\u2019 approach, leaving the students stranded. Wakaz said he helped round up the cadets but insists he played no role in what came next.After separating the trainees by sect \u2014 Sunni to one side, Shiite to the other \u2014 ISIS gunmen marched hundreds of the Shiite cadets to various spots around Tikrit to be machine-gunned, the mass murders dutifully videotaped by ISIS cameramen for posting on the internet. Traditionally, armies and guerrilla groups try to deny or minimize their war crimes, but not so with ISIS; when outside observers first estimated that 800 cadets were murdered that day in Tikrit, ISIS spokesmen boasted that they had actually killed many more. (The final death toll remains unknown, but estimates now range as high as 1,700.)After the Camp Speicher massacre, Wakaz signed up with ISIS for a one-year enlistment \u2014 for a terrorist organization, it has a surprisingly formal bureaucracy \u2014 and was ferried up Highway 1 with a large group of fellow recruits to an ISIS compound outside Mosul. There, he learned the rudimentary skills imparted to new soldiers everywhere: running obstacle courses, breaking down and firing various weapons, tactical drills on maintaining squad cohesion on the battlefield. But soon enough his training took a more brutal turn.On a morning in late June, Wakaz was summoned from his barracks by a senior commander. Instructing the 19-year-old to follow, the commander led Wakaz to a field at the edge of the compound. After a few moments, they were joined by two other men, an ISIS fighter and a civilian who appeared to be in his 30s. The civilian was blindfolded, with his hands tied behind his back, and he was crying. The ISIS fighter roughly forced the crying man to his knees, as the commander handed Wakaz a pistol. The former day laborer from Dawr knew precisely what was expected of him.\u201cThey showed me how to do it,\u201d Wakaz said. \u201cYou point the gun downward. Also to not shoot directly at the center of the head, but to go a little bit off to one side.\u201dIn the training-compound field, Wakaz dutifully carried out his first execution. Over the following few weeks, he was summoned to the field five more times, to murder five more blindfolded and handcuffed men. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about them,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I would say they ranged in age from about 35 to maybe 70. After that first one, only one other was crying. With the others, I think maybe they didn\u2019t know what was about to happen.\u201dWakaz related all this \u2014 even physically acted out how a proper killing was done \u2014 with no visible emotion. But then, as if belatedly realizing the coldbloodedness of his account, he gave a small shrug.\u201cI felt bad doing it,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I had no choice. Once we reached Mosul, there was no way to leave \u2014 and with ISIS, if you don\u2019t obey, they kill you too.\u201dKurdistanSee Map\u201cI don\u2019t really remember him that well, because I was only 8 when he died,\u201d Azar said. \u201cMy strongest memory is that there was just a constant parade of pesh merga commanders coming to our house, conferring with my father.\u201dFor nearly 30 years, Heso\u2019s remains were lost somewhere in the mountains of Kurdistan, but a few years ago Azar and his brothers began a monthslong quest to locate them. By talking with villagers and Heso\u2019s surviving companions, they finally found his bones at the bottom of a remote ravine.\u201cWe brought them back to our village, and he was given a hero\u2019s funeral,\u201d Azar said. \u201cEven Barzani was there\u201d \u2014 the K.R.G.\u2019s president, Massoud Barzani.The doctor\u2019s sense of personal loss was more evident when he talked of the death of his brother Ali, the second-oldest of the 14 Mirkhan siblings and the first to follow Heso into the ranks of pesh merga leadership. \u201cWhen Ali was killed, it was a tragedy not just for the family, but all Kurdistan,\u201d Azar said. \u201cHe was a natural leader of men \u2014 charismatic, brilliant \u2014 and, O.K., he was my brother, but I believe we would be in a very different place now if he had stayed alive. Many, many people who knew him have said this to me.\u201dAzar told me these stories on the drive described in the preface, perhaps in part to explain why our destination, a little village in Iraq called Gunde Siba, still haunted him. He was on an indefinite leave of absence from the hospital where he worked in Erbil, the K.R.G. capital, to devote all his energies to confronting the crisis caused by the ISIS invasion. His duties, which appeared to be largely self-determined, consisted of periodically touring the pesh merga front lines and advising its commanders. Everyone in the K.R.G., it seemed, knew the Mirkhan name, and one of its happier consequences was that its bearers could expect to be treated with immediate respect and deference.As we spoke, it became clear that Azar\u2019s self-appointed mission went far beyond confronting the threat of ISIS. He saw in the K.R.G.\u2019s current situation a precious and unprecedented opportunity to create a true Kurdish nation. To achieve that meant not just defeating the ISIS fanatics but ridding the land of the Kurds\u2019 historical enemies, the Arabs, once and for all. \u201cFor fourteen hundred years, they have sworn to destroy us,\u201d he said. \u201cAt what point do we take them at their word?\u201d To Azar, that point had now been reached. In his view, which is by no means a minority one in the K.R.G., the first task at hand is to sever the remaining vestiges of the Iraqi state \u2014 it is a point of pride with Azar that he doesn\u2019t speak Arabic and has only once been to Baghdad \u2014 and then to dismantle the legacy of forced Arab-Kurd integration initiated by Saddam Hussein.Part of the doctor\u2019s severity stems from what he regards as Kurdish complacency in the face of the dangers that lay all around, and it is further fueled by the tragedy he witnessed in Gunde Siba on Aug. 3, 2014.For 22 years after its creation in 1992, the K.R.G. was a relative oasis of stability and peace in the region, its ties to Baghdad ever more theoretical. That exempt status was most nakedly revealed during the American intervention in Iraq, in which the K.R.G. openly sided with the invaders, providing them with back bases and airfields from which to carry out the fight; as local officials are fond of pointing out, not a single coalition soldier was killed in the K.R.G. during the Iraq war. That calm continued through the steady disintegration of Iraq after the American withdrawal, as the K.R.G. became ever more reluctant to pay even lip service to affiliation with Baghdad. To the good citizens of the K.R.G., it increasingly appeared that their mountain enclave had somehow found a way to escape the maelstroms swirling around it, that the days of warrior families like the Mirkhans might go the way of folklore. That fanciful notion ended with ISIS\u2019 lightning advance into central Iraq in June 2014.\u201cI\u2019ve never trusted the Arabs, but as strange as it sounds, I trusted Daesh,\u201d Azar explained, using a common term for ISIS. \u201cIn the past, the Arabs always lied \u2014 \u2018Oh, you Kurds have nothing to fear from us\u2019 \u2014 and then they attacked us. But Daesh was absolutely clear what they were going to do. They wanted to take this part of the world back to the caliphate. They wanted to eliminate everyone who was not their kind \u2014 the Christians and the Kurds and the Shia \u2014 and they were absolutely open about it. After their June offensive, I had no doubt they were coming for us next.\u201d The doctor even pinpointed where they would strike first. \u201cAny fool looking at a map could know. It was going to be the Yazidis. It was going to be Sinjar.\u201dThe Yazidis are a Kurdish religious minority that ISIS had long excoriated as \u201cdevil worshipers\u201d and vowed to exterminate. Their Mount Sinjar heartland was in the far northwestern corner of Iraq and outside official K.R.G. territory, making them especially vulnerable. What\u2019s more \u2014 and this is what a glance at a map made obvious \u2014 with ISIS\u2019 capture of Mosul that June, the land link between the K.R.G. and the Yazidi Kurds in Sinjar was reduced to a single rutted farm road.In the days and weeks after the June offensive, Azar made use of his family name to compel meetings within his circle of civilian and military comrades. At each, he warned of the coming ISIS attack. \u201cNo one took it seriously,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThey all said, \u2018No, their fight is with the Shia in Baghdad, why would they come here?\u2019 \u201dOn Aug. 1, 2014, ISIS guerrillas attacked an isolated pesh merga outpost in the town of Zumar, which lay just 10 miles away from the last road into Sinjar. When still there was no sign of action by the government, in desperation Azar Mirkhan rustled up five or six of his pesh merga friends, and together they raced west.\u201cAnd this is as far as we got,\u201d Azar said. \u201cRight here.\u201dWe were standing on the shoulder of the road in Gunde Siba, just a few miles west of the Tigris River and still some 40 miles from the town of Sinjar. \u201cBy then, it was night, and right here we started meeting the pesh merga who had fled from Sinjar and, behind them, the Yazidi refugees. It was impossible to go on because the road was just jammed, everyone trying to escape. We set up a defense post here and rallied some of the pesh merga to stay with us, but this is as far as we got.\u201d He lit a cigarette and blew smoke into the air. \u201cWe were one day too late.\u201dIn Sinjar that day \u2014 Aug. 3 \u2014 ISIS began carrying out mass executions, a slaughter that would ultimately claim the lives of at least 5,000 Yazidis. They were also rounding up thousands of girls and women to be used as sex slaves. Tens of thousands more Yazidis were frantically scaling the flanks of Mount Sinjar in a bid to escape the killers. Of all this, Azar Mirkhan had only an intimation in the terror-stricken faces and anguished accounts of those survivors streaming into Gunde Siba.But Azar had little time to grasp, let alone address, the tragedy unfolding in Sinjar. Just two days later, ISIS began a second offensive, this one aimed directly at the K.R.G. capital city, Erbil. Turning back from Gunde Siba, the doctor raced south for the battlefield.As it happened, Azar\u2019s older brother Araz, 44, was the deputy commander of pesh merga forces along the very section of the K.R.G. frontier, Sector 6, that bore the brunt of the new ISIS assault. Azar immediately went into battle alongside his brother \u2014 but not just Araz. Most of Azar\u2019s other brothers had long since moved abroad as part of the Kurdish diaspora and had become doctors and engineers in the United States and Europe, but befitting the Mirkhan family\u2019s warrior-caste reputation, many of them set aside their businesses and medical practices to race to the K.R.G. and take up arms. At one point in that summer, five Mirkhan brothers, along with one of Azar\u2019s nephews, were fighting shoulder to shoulder at a Sector 6 firebase.\u201cIt was a good thing ISIS didn\u2019t drop a mortar on us right then,\u201d Azar joked. \u201cOur mother would have been upset.\u201dBut something did happen in the battle that changed Azar. After coming within 15 miles of Erbil, the ISIS advance stalled and was then thrown back by a furious pesh merga counteroffensive. During that counterattack on Aug. 20, an ISIS sniper\u2019s bullet shattered Azar\u2019s right hand. For weeks afterward, there was concern that he might lose the hand altogether, but surgery and physical therapy helped restore some function.\u201cThe important thing is that I can shoot a gun again now,\u201d Azar said, gently curling and uncurling his fingers. \u201cNot as well as before, but almost.\u201dSuspected members of ISIS held by Kurds at a prison in\u00a0Kani Goma, June 2015.Prisoner.

Majd was at work when he received a frantic phone call from his mother: There had just been an explosion at Akrama al-Makhzomeh, the school attended by Majd\u2019s 11-year-old younger brother, Ali, with reports of many casualties.His mother raced to the scene, but Majd was unable to leave work for another 90 minutes. The memory of what he saw when he finally arrived at the school cast the perennially cheerful Majd into a dark corner within himself, his eyes settling into a sad, distant stare.\u201cNever could I have imagined something like that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like a nightmare, the worst nightmare. Blood everywhere, parts of children, and they\u2019re everywhere around you, and you\u2019re walking through all this \u2014 you\u2019re stepping on body parts. ...\u201d He closed his eyes briefly, struggled to control his breathing. \u201cIt\u2019s something I can just never get out of my mind.\u201dIt was only when Majd learned the details of what happened, though, that he grasped the full savagery of the attack. Just as parents and rescuers began swarming into Akrama al-Makhzomeh in response to the first blast, from a car bomb, a suicide bomber tried to enter the school\u2019s main courtyard to kill more. Shut out by an alert guard, the bomber blew himself up at the front gate. When Majd\u2019s mother reached the bomb site, she found Ali hiding with a group of terrified classmates at the back of the school.The double bombing at Akrama al-Makhzomeh killed at least 45, including 41 schoolchildren. It was another reminder \u2014 as if the people of Homs needed one \u2014 that in the new Syria, no haven was truly safe, no place off-limits to the murderers. In its aftermath, the Ibrahim family, like almost everyone else in New Akrama, largely stayed indoors, venturing outside only when necessary.KurdistanSee MapA soldier called out a warning: An ISIS sniper had been spotted in the village an hour earlier, and, in his current stance, Azar made for a very easy target. The doctor gave the man an irritated look, then turned back to his binoculars.The firebase consisted of a series of hastily constructed berms and dugouts on a ridge line about three miles from the Tigris River, with ISIS in control of the lowlands below. In the time he spent here, Azar had survived several ISIS attacks.\u201cFirst, they send in their suicide bombers in armored Humvees. If you don\u2019t destroy them as they come up the hill \u2014 and you need to make a direct hit \u2014 they blast huge holes in the walls, because these are just massive explosions. Then in the confusion of that, they send in their infantry and, behind them, the snipers. It all happens very fast: Everything quiet, and then suddenly they\u2019re everywhere. The important thing is to stay calm, to pick your targets, because if you panic, you\u2019re finished. That\u2019s the problem with the Iraqi Army; they always panic.\u201dPanic didn\u2019t seem to figure prominently in Azar\u2019s range of emotions. \u201cI like fighting Daesh,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re actually quite smart. It\u2019s almost a kind of game.\u201dPerhaps not surprising in a people so implacably committed to establishing a homeland, the Kurds of the K.R.G. find it intolerable that ISIS should maintain dominion over any of their territory. Much as the United States Army will sustain more casualties in order to retrieve their battlefield dead, so the pesh merga have been willing to suffer higher losses to recover Kurdish ground more quickly.At Black Tiger Camp, the back-base command center of Sector 6, Sirwan Barzani, the overall sector commander, could point to the enormous color-coded battlefront map on his office wall and rattle off statistics remarkable in their specificity. \u201cWhen I first arrived here,\u201d he said, \u201cDaesh was just three kilometers down the road. Now we have cleared them for 23 kilometers to the west and 34 kilometers to the south. In my sector, we have retaken 1,100 square kilometers, but we still have about 214 square kilometers to go.\u201dBy May 2015, Barzani said, nearly 120 pesh merga had died in Sector 6, where the greatest ISIS incursions had occurred. At the same time, pesh merga commanders make an interesting distinction between where they are willing to suffer losses to regain land and where they aren\u2019t. For example, the ISIS-held village that Azar studied with his binoculars was inhabited by Arabs, not Kurds.\u201cSo even though it is on K.R.G. territory, it\u2019s not worth losing men for,\u201d he explained. \u201cNot until we\u2019re ready to do a much bigger offensive.\u201dBut when that offensive might come was a matter tied up with international geopolitics, and with the outcome of decisions being made in Washington and Brussels and Baghdad. In light of the woeful conduct of the Iraqi Army in the past \u2014 and absent any will to place significant numbers of Western troops on the ground \u2014 many American and European politicians and foreign-policy advisers were calling for deputizing the one fighting force in the region that had proved its mettle, the pesh merga, to lead the campaign to destroy ISIS. Less clear was whether anyone had seriously discussed this idea with the Kurds.\u201cYou know, the Americans come here, and they want to talk about retaking Mosul,\u201d Sirwan Barzani said. \u201cAre you going to do it with American troops? No. Are you going to do it with the Iraqi Army? No, because they\u2019re useless. So let\u2019s have the Kurds do it. But what do we want with Mosul? It\u2019s not Kurdistan; it\u2019s Iraq, and why should we lose more men for the sake of Iraq?\u201dAnimating that resistance, beyond the traditional Kurdish antipathy for the regime in Baghdad, was what the Iraqi Army collapse in 2014 brought down on the K.R.G. The Iraqis, by abandoning their American-supplied heavy weaponry and vehicles to ISIS \u2014 in most cases, they didn\u2019t even have the presence of mind to destroy it \u2014 had virtually overnight converted the guerrilla force into one of the best-equipped armies in the region, and it was the Kurds who paid the price.By May 2015, the Americans were still trying to cobble together a workable arrangement. The response time for airstrikes against ISIS targets had greatly improved because of the recent deployment of American aerial spotter teams in the K.R.G., but much slower going was the effort to forge some kind of rapprochement between the pesh merga and the Iraqi Army. Directly beside Barzani\u2019s Black Tiger Camp in Gwer was a smaller base where Iraqi soldiers were receiving American training. \u201cI pray for the day I don\u2019t have to see that anymore,\u201d Barzani said, pointing to the Iraqi flag flying from the adjacent base.But Black Tiger Camp revealed something else about the K.R.G., an aspect of the society that most of its officials, whether civilian or military, try to play down or avoid speaking about altogether. For the entire time of its existence \u2014 and indeed, far predating that \u2014 the K.R.G. has been riven into two feuding camps, a schism that led to open civil war in the 1990s. On the surface, it has the trappings of a political duel between its two main parties, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (K.D.P.) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (P.U.K.), but in actuality, it is a contest between two great tribal groupings, the Barzani and the Talabani. The territory\u2019s north is thoroughly dominated by the Barzanis and their tribal allies \u2014 the Mirkhans among them \u2014 virtually all of whom are K.D.P. Southern K.R.G., by contrast, is controlled by the Talabanis and their tribal allies under the P.U.K. label.The feudalistic nature of this arrangement was on display at Black Tiger. All of the pesh merga at the camp, and along the entire 75-mile front of Sector 6, are \u201cBarzanis,\u201d as denoted by their red-and-white tribal scarves. In the Talabani sectors of southern K.R.G., the pesh merga scarves are black and white.Further, Sirwan Barzani is the \u201ccommander\u201d of Sector 6 less through any military acumen on his part \u2014 before the war, he was the extremely wealthy owner of a cellphone-service provider \u2014 than through the fact that he is the nephew of the K.R.G.\u2019s president, Massoud Barzani, who in turn is the son of the legendary Kurdish warlord Mustafa Barzani. This also explains Sirwan\u2019s impolitic frankness with a foreign journalist; as a full-fledged Barzani, he is quite beyond the reach of more temperate but lesser-named K.R.G. politicians to muzzle.This enduring schism has had tragic consequences. In the first days of the ISIS advance into the K.R.G., the pesh merga\u2019s performance was extremely shaky, and as much as they wish to fix blame for that on the collapse of the Iraqi Army, an enormous contributing factor was that there were actually two pesh mergas, with little in the way of coordination between them. ISIS took advantage of that to nearly capture the K.R.G. capital, Erbil, and to start their extermination campaign against the Yazidis.Time and again in the K.R.G., I detected a sense of guilt, even of shame, when conversation turned to the fate of the Yazidis. With no one, though, did I sense it more than with Azar Mirkhan. Part of that may have stemmed from his having tried to aid them at their critical hour, only to discover that the hour had come and gone. But on a philosophical level, he also felt the Kurds had betrayed their history.\u201cYou could say that, in many ways, the Yazidis are the pure Kurds,\u201d he explained. \u201cTheir religion is what all Kurds believed at one time, not all this Shia-Sunni business. Everyone else changed, but they stayed true to the faith.\u201dAlong with his touring of the battlefronts, Azar has spent a great deal of time at the Yazidi displaced-persons camps in northern K.R.G., often working with a Kurdish-Swedish doctor named Nemam Ghafouri. These camps \u2014 some run by small independent charities, some by large international relief organizations \u2014 are home to tens of thousands of the Yazidis who outran the ISIS advance of August 2014, but when I visited in May 2015, they were being joined by a handful of others who had recently either escaped or been ransomed out from ISIS control. Despite having interviewed countless war and atrocity survivors across the world over the years, I found something uniquely horrifying about these returnees\u2019 stories. It took me some time to realize this was because of what was left unsaid, the need to puzzle out the depravity to which they were subjected.ISIS had used rape and sexual slavery as a weapon of war to destroy the fabric of Yazidi society, and now that some of these girls and women were returning, the conservative Yazidi honor code didn\u2019t permit them to speak of what happened to them. In the company of Ghafouri, I met a 10-year-old girl whose extended family had raised $1,500 \u2014 the savings of several lifetimes \u2014 to buy her freedom the week before. She said her ISIS owners had only made her clean and wash their clothes, that they never touched her, and this was a story the family was determined to believe. I met two teenage girls who had escaped from ISIS after one month, along with a relative whom I took to be their mother \u2014 she looked perhaps 45 years old, but a very hard 45: sunken cheeks, missing teeth, graying hair \u2014 who had been held for eight months. Except this woman wasn\u2019t their mother; she was their older sister, and she was only 24. By her account, she had feigned deafness, which is seen by ISIS as a sign of mental illness, and in this way she, too, avoided being molested. As Ghafouri explained, her mission now was to come up with some pretext to see the 10-year-old girl and the 24-year-old woman alone. After winning their trust, she would conduct a physical examination. If they had, in fact, been raped, she would inform their families that they had some sort of infection and needed to be placed in a special hospital \u2014 no visitors \u2014 for a week.\u201cSo then they are taken to Erbil,\u201d she explained. \u201cThey have the reconstruction \u2014 it\u2019s actually a simple operation \u2014 and they come back as virgins. Then they can be accepted back; they can marry someday. Of course it means they can never talk about what happened. They must keep it inside forever. But this is what passes for a happy ending now.\u201dHearing such testimonials has further hardened Azar Mirkhan\u2019s beliefs about what needs to be done if the Kurds are ever to find safety. In his view, ISIS was only the latest in a long line of implacable Arab enemies. \u201cIf this was the first time, then maybe you could say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s this horrible group of terrorists.\u2019 But this has been going on for our entire history. I can promise you that when we retake Sinjar, we will go there and we will find that the Arabs stayed with ISIS,\u201d Azar said. \u201cO.K., some are here in the camps, but many more stayed. So that is why I say our enemy is not just ISIS; it\u2019s all Arabs.\u201dSinjar, Iraq, November 2015.Azar Mirkhan near Sinjar, November 2015.Pesh merga front line, northern Iraq, May 2015.Arbat, a refugee camp near Sulaimaniya, Iraq, June 2015.Arbat, June 2015.A Yazidi refugee camp near Duhok, Iraq, May 2015.Azar Mirkhan (left) at a pesh merga camp near Mosul, Iraq, May 2015.Azar Mirkhan being shown ISIS-held positions in and around Sinjar, May 2015.Azar Mirkhan at a front-line position in Sinjar, May 2015.IraqSee MapPart of his reason may have involved economics; with ISIS\u2019 salad days clearly over, Wakaz\u2019s pay packet often arrived late. But it most likely was rooted even more in self-preservation. Because, slowly but surely, the tide appeared to be turning against ISIS.This was made evident to Wakaz as he contemplated just where he might go to start over. In April, the Iraqi Army, supported by American airstrikes, had recaptured Tikrit, and by that June they were closing ever tighter around Baiji. That still left Mosul and the ISIS-controlled towns in Anbar Province, but life in any of those places for an ex-ISIS fighter was sure to be grim: He would be resented by his former comrades, and a dead man should the Iraqi Army take control.Wakaz finally settled on a very different destination: the Kurdish-controlled Iraqi city of Kirkuk.Just as in Mosul and Baiji and Tikrit, the Iraqi Army garrisoned in Kirkuk broke and fled before the ISIS offensive a year earlier. But there the similarities ended. Racing to fill the void left by the Iraqis, thousands of pesh merga soldiers had poured into Kirkuk just ahead of ISIS and managed to throw back their advance. Ever since, Kirkuk has effectively been under Kurdish control, but the melting-pot city was also teeming with both Sunni and Shiite refugees, making it a natural hide-out for both active and former Islamist fighters. Although Kirkuk was a mere 60 miles from Baiji, the two cities were now separated by the heavily fortified line of the pesh merga army. It meant that, to reach his sanctuary city, Wakaz would have to travel the ISIS \u201cratline.\u201dSyria \u2022 GreeceSee MapJust days after his graduation, Majd\u2019s parents handed their son $3,000 \u2014 all the savings they had left \u2014 and told him to leave the country.\u201cTo them it was no longer about patriotism or defending the country,\u201d he said, \u201cbut about my staying alive.\u201d He gave a faint smile. \u201cPlus, I would have made a terrible soldier.\u201dOn June 21, Majd\u2019s father escorted him to Damascus, where two days later he caught a flight for Turkey. Besides the $3,000, all Majd carried was whatever could fit into his small knapsack.Hoping to stay at least somewhat near home, Majd began looking for work in Turkey. When that proved futile, he saw no choice but to join the migrant trail being negotiated by hundreds of thousands of his countrymen that summer, and so he headed west for Turkey\u2019s Aegean coast, where he might seek passage to Europe. Along the way, he serendipitously met up with an old friend from Homs whom he hadn\u2019t seen in years, Amjad, who was traveling with Ammar, another refugee from Homs. The three became a traveling team. Consequently, they shared the same overcrowded inflatable raft that, on the night of July 27, made the passage from a smuggler\u2019s beach near Bodrum, a Turkish resort town, to Kos, a Greek island several miles away.There, Majd and his two friends endured an agonizing wait. With Kos overwhelmed by tens of thousands of would-be migrants, Greek authorities were taking up to 10 days simply to issue the registry papers that would allow their onward travel. That summer, the migrant route through Eastern Europe was becoming increasingly inhospitable, with several governments threatening to shut it down completely. Finally, Majd and his friends received their papers late on the afternoon of Aug. 4. That left them just enough time to catch the nightly ferry for the Greek mainland, the beginning of their search for refuge somewhere in Europe.TKIraq \u2022 Syria \u2022 TurkeySee MapEver since ISIS gained strength in eastern Syria in early 2014, there have been accusations that their success relied on Turkey\u2019s keeping its border deliberately porous so that Islamist fighters from around the world might pass back and forth. That charge was made most explicitly by the Russian government in late 2015. While the Turkish administration of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vehemently denied the charge, evidence supports the Russian account. Eleven of nearly two dozen captured ISIS fighters that I interviewed for this report claimed to have transited through Turkey at some point during their ISIS service. Nearly all of those 11 told me they encountered Turkish soldiers or police while crossing the Turkish-Syrian frontier and were simply waved through. That was certainly the experience of Wakaz.\u201cThe man who was leading us, he went up to the Turkish checkpoint and talked to the guards for a few minutes,\u201d Wakaz said. \u201cMaybe he gave them some money, I don\u2019t know, but then we just passed on.\u201dAs to whether there was any chance the Turkish border guards didn\u2019t grasp the affiliation of those they were letting through, Wakaz briskly shook his head. \u201cOf course they knew. We were all young guys, and the man taking us across was Daesh. He went across there all the time. They knew.\u201dFrom Turkey, Wakaz made another clandestine crossing into K.R.G. territory, and by the beginning of July 2015, two weeks after he left ISIS, he was in Kirkuk and ready for a fresh start. He was soon joined there by another ISIS retiree, his brother Mohammed.At least initially, it seemed the Hassan brothers had chosen well. In Kirkuk, they moved into a small apartment in a neighborhood favored by other ex-ISIS fighters trying to escape notice, and within a week, both brothers found work on a nearby construction site. At that point, if Wakaz had a dream for the future, it was simply to lie low in Kirkuk, save as much money as possible, return home when the situation permitted and open his own small shop.As modest and heavily conditional as that dream was, it ended on the afternoon of Sept. 7, 2015, when a black car pulled alongside Wakaz on a Kirkuk street. Rolling down his window, the man in the front passenger seat, an undercover policeman, asked the young man with the piercing eyes for his identification card.Refugees off Lesbos Island, September 2015.Refugees landing on Lesbos, September 2015.Refugees waiting to register with the Greek police in Mytilini, the capital city of Lesbos, September 2015.Refugees in Mytilini, September 2015.Refugees in Mytilini, September 2015.Refugees outside the police booth in Mytilini, September 2015.Refugees waiting to register in Mytilini, September 2015.A clash between Syrian and Afghan refugees in Mytilini,\u00a0September 2015.A Syrian collapsing in the heat in Mytilini, September 2015.Refugees in Mytilini, September 2015.Refugees in Mytilini, September 2015.Refugees reaching Lesbos, November 2015.Refugees landing on Lesbos, November 2015.Walking toward Mytilini, November 2015.Walking to Mytilini, November 2015.The body of a migrant, Lesbos, November 2015.Refugees landing at Kos Island, August 2015.A tourist beach on Kos, August 2015.Kos, August 2015.Kos, August 2015.Kos, August 2015.GermanySee MapFrom Greece, the Syrian friends had traveled the migrant trail through Eastern Europe and reached southern Germany by mid-August. Majd had intended to continue on alone to Sweden, where he\u2019d heard winning asylum was easiest, but those plans were dashed when the friends were pulled off a northbound train by the police. After being shunted between migrant holding facilities, they were taken to Dresden in mid-September.For refugees from Homs to find themselves in Dresden held a certain paradox. The city, known for having been largely destroyed by Allied bombing in World War II, was also the center of the growing anti-immigration movement that had spread across Germany over the previous year. Right-wing nationalists were staging mass demonstrations in the city every Monday night. When I visited Majd, it had been just a week since terrorist attacks in Paris killed 130, and anger against migrants \u2014 and especially any from Muslim countries \u2014 was reaching a fever pitch.\u201cThere have been quite a few incidents here just this past week,\u201d Majd told me. \u201cA lot of the guys won\u2019t go to the city center at all right now.\u201dCertainly they wouldn\u2019t be heading downtown that evening, a Monday, when the anti-immigrant speeches in Dresden\u2019s Theaterplatz would kick off promptly at 7.Majd spoke frequently of his intention to return to Syria; an intention that partly explained why he asked for his face not to be shown in his portrait. That afternoon I asked if he could foresee a time when such a return would be possible. He thought for a long time. \u201cMinimum, 10 years from now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a saying in Syria: \u2018Blood brings blood.\u2019 Now everyone will want to take revenge for what has been done to them these past years, so it will just go on and on. Blood brings blood. I don\u2019t think it will end until everyone who has taken up a gun in this war is dead. Even if the killing speeds up, that will still take at least 10 years.\u201dBy coincidence, I was with Majd the following day, when, returning to his communal apartment, he found a letter awaiting him. It was from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees, and it informed Majd that a background check had been completed and that no problems were found; it was the last major hurdle in his petition for residency, making it all but certain that he would now be allowed to stay in Germany for the next three years. Setting the letter aside, Majd crossed to one of the attic\u2019s dormer windows and sat, staring out at the street, for a long time.Jordan \u2022 Greece \u2022 GermanySee MapWith Ali al-Zaidi\u2019s health too precarious to withstand the rigors of a hard journey, it was decided that Sahar would remain with him in Amman while Khulood and Teamim made for Europe. On Dec. 4, they took a flight to Istanbul and from there followed the by-now well-worn migrant trail down the Turkish coast to Izmir. After arranging to pay a smuggler 2,000 euros for spots aboard a boat, the sisters waited. The summons finally came on the night of Dec. 11.They were driven an hour and a half down the coast. Slipping to the shoreline in the darkness, Khulood and Teamim clambered aboard a severely overloaded rubber raft \u2014 Khulood counted at least 30 other passengers, rather than the eight or 10 it was designed to hold \u2014 which then pushed off for the Greek island of Samos, a three-hour journey.The overburdened raft lay so low in the water that twice the outboard motor died when waves broke over it. But the greatest danger came when they nearly reached safety. On the murky sliver-moon night, the pilot misgauged his approach to the Samos beach and smashed the raft against a rock outcropping; instantly, one of the air-filled pontoons began to collapse. Ready to join the other passengers tumbling into the water from the sinking boat \u2014 fortunately, all wore life preservers \u2014 Khulood thought to glance over at Teamim. Her oldest sister sat stock-still, too paralyzed with fear to react.\u201cI yelled at her to jump,\u201d Khulood recalled, \u201cbecause the waves were very high and they were going to smash us against the rocks, but she just couldn\u2019t move. I saw that she was going to die, but I thought, We\u2019ve come too far together, we must now share our fate.\u201dClambering over to her sister, Khulood grabbed Teamim and somehow managed to get them both clear of the sinking vessel and onto the rocks. There they were promptly knocked down by another wave, with Teamim badly hurting her leg in the fall, but at least they were now on land. In the dark, Khulood helped her limping sister up the hillside to join the rest of the migrants as they set out in search of shelter.The following two weeks became a blur of travel and waiting and tension for the two sisters from Iraq, an object lesson in both the callous indifference of officialdom and in the life-altering kindness of strangers. After registering with Greek authorities in Samos, the sisters were allowed to board a ferryboat for the Greek mainland and Athens, where they were sheltered by a friend of a friend. With the situation at the Eastern European frontiers changing constantly \u2014 and not in any way that augured well for the thousands of migrants still streaming north \u2014 the sisters quickly moved on. By Dec. 22, through a combination of bus, train and foot travel, Khulood and Teamim had crossed five European borders to finally reach southern Germany.There, their luck appeared to run out. Arrested shortly after crossing the German frontier, the sisters were held in jail until dark, then sent back into Austria and instructed to make for a refugee holding center in Klagenfurt. That camp was overflowing, however, and they were denied entry. With nowhere else to go, Khulood and Teamim simply huddled together outside the camp\u2019s gates \u2014 and then it began to snow.Their salvation was arranged through social media. After Khulood posted notice of her situation on Facebook, a small international band of activists mobilized in search of someone in the Klagenfurt area who might help the sisters. That aid soon arrived in the form of a local Green member of Parliament, who took Khulood and Teamim to a cafe to eat and warm up. At the cafe, the politician also sent out an urgent message seeking a local family who might temporarily take in the sisters; within an hour, he had received eight offers. From the cafe, the Zaidi sisters were taken to the home of Elisabeth and Erich Edelsbrunner.\u201cToday is the first day we feel comfortable and relaxed,\u201d Khulood emailed a friend in England the following day, Christmas Eve. \u201cThe family is very nice. They have given us our own room. They have a very lovely dog. I love him.\u201dIraqSee MapAfter his arrest, Wakaz quickly confessed to having been an ISIS fighter. He provided details of his service, including the six executions he carried out in Mosul. Whether this confession was coerced through torture was impossible to know \u2014 in conversation with me in the prison, Wakaz insisted that the Asayish interrogators hadn\u2019t mistreated him in any way, but even tortured prisoners tend to say that when their captors are standing over them. Over the course of our two long interviews, the young man sometimes contradicted himself, perhaps a result of trying to gauge what his questioner and captors might want to hear. That said, there seemed a core candor to his words that perhaps was at least partly because of a stricken conscience.\u201cI did bad things,\u201d he told me, \u201cand I need to confess to them before God.\u201dShortly after his arrest, Wakaz also informed on his brother Mohammed. It took Asayish a month to track down the older Hassan sibling, and he was being held in a different prison near Kirkuk. There had been no contact between the brothers since their arrests, but Wakaz hoped Mohammed was also making a clean slate of things. His main goal now, he said, was to atone for his crimes by helping the authorities identify whichever of his former ISIS colleagues were still alive. \u201cIf I had a chance to do it over again,\u201d he said, \u201cI never would have joined Daesh. I saw the evil things they did, and I know now that they aren\u2019t true Muslims.\u201dDespite this professed change of heart, the 21-year-old is cleareyed about his future. \u201cI have no illusions, and I have no hope,\u201d he told me. \u201cI believe I will spend the rest of my life in prison.\u201dBut Wakaz was basing that belief on the fact that he had been captured by K.R.G. investigators and remained in Kurdish custody. In reality, a grimmer future was being planned for Wakaz, one plainly laid out to me by a senior Asayish officer at the secret prison.Since the events of June 2014 \u2014 when the Iraqi Army in Kirkuk melted away before the ISIS assault, and the Kurds rushed unto the breach \u2014 the city has technically been under the joint control of the Iraqis and the Kurds. But this collaboration exists largely on paper. In practice, the Kurdish authorities have little faith in their Iraqi counterparts and see even less reason to cooperate with them on security matters. Nowhere is this separation more evident than on issues relating to ISIS.\u201cThat\u2019s why we haven\u2019t told the Iraqis about the guys in here,\u201d explained the Asayish official. \u201cIf we did, they would demand we hand them over, since most of their crimes were committed on Iraqi territory. Then they would either kill these guys outright or, if some of them are high enough up in the Daesh leadership to arrange a bribe, let them go. We just can\u2019t trust the Iraqis at all.\u201d In light of that, the Asayish plan is to keep Wakaz under wraps and to use him to identify other ISIS fighters they capture and with whom he might have served in the field. Once his usefulness to Asayish comes to an end \u2014 and that may not be until after the retaking of Mosul and the trove of ISIS fighters expected to surrender there \u2014 Wakaz will be handed over to the Iraqi authorities. At that point, his future will be short and preordained.\u201cHe thinks his life will be saved because we have him, and he knows we don\u2019t execute,\u201d the Asayish officer said. \u201cBut Iraq does. The Iraqis will try him in their courts, and they will give him a death sentence. Then they will transfer him to a prison in Iraq to be hanged.\u201dWhen I asked if there was any chance that, because of Wakaz\u2019s assistance in unmasking other ISIS fighters, a judge might show leniency in his case, the Asayish officer quickly shook his head. Or that he could somehow cut a deal to spare his life? The officer pondered briefly, then shook his head even more forcefully.\u201cIf he was senior Daesh, maybe,\u201d he said. \u201cBut he is a nobody and poor. So no. No chance.\u201dEgyptSee MapBy then, Alaa was approaching the one-year mark of a five-year prison sentence, just as his father, now deceased, had predicted. It was a high price for speaking out, and one of the awful paradoxes Alaa faced \u2014 along with thousands of other political prisoners in Egypt today \u2014 was that the old way of appealing to Cairo on human rights issues no longer worked. In the Mubarak era, if enough pressure was brought to bear by the American government and Western activist groups, an Egyptian political prisoner was likely to be quietly released. If General Sisi took away any lesson from Mubarak\u2019s downfall, though, it was to never be viewed as the West\u2019s lap dog. Western pressure applied today has little effect and might even be counterproductive.\u201cBut of course, you also can\u2019t stay quiet about it,\u201d Laila said, \u201cbecause this is exactly what they want. You have to keep trying, even if it seems futile.\u201dThe obduracy of the Sisi regime on human rights has undoubtedly been compounded by a new economic reality. Today, the annual American subsidy to Egypt is less than $1.3 billion, down from more than $2 billion in Mubarak\u2019s heyday. At the same time, Saudi Arabia and other gulf states have subsidized the Egyptian government with an estimated $30 billion since Sisi took power, and given the Saudis\u2019 own record on such matters, they seem unlikely to pester their client state over issues like political prisoners or freedom of expression. The simple fact is that the West in general, and the United States in particular, now has less influence over the Egyptian state than at any time since the early 1970s.Laila derives some perverse hope from the recent economic deterioration of Egypt, a decline so rapid and deep that it might, she believes, finally erode all remaining confidence in the present regime. \u201cSisi still has pools of support,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it\u2019s getting smaller all the time. The situation is really unsustainable now.\u201d But in March 2016, there were scant signs in Cairo or elsewhere in Egypt that any serious dissident movement was in the offing. \u201cNo, it won\u2019t happen today, and it won\u2019t be like Tahrir,\u201d Laila said. \u201cI give it 18 months. In 18 months, either there will be a kind of palace coup \u2014 the generals put Sisi to one side and bring in someone more moderate \u2014 or we will come to a new wave of widespread protest. If that happens, it won\u2019t be like 2011. This time, it will be far more violent.\u201dThe Sisi regime shows few signs of being worried. A second case against Alaa, for criticizing the justice system on his Facebook page, is currently in court. He faces the possibility of another sentence of six months to three years. Even if prosecutors drop that case, Laila will be 64 when her son is released.Mourners after an ISIS bombing, which killed at least 300, in the Karrada district of Baghdad, July 2016.The site of the Karrada district bombing, July 2016.Karrada district, July 2016.Karrada district, July 2016.A Shiite shrine that ISIS attacked, killing nearly 40 people, in Balad, July 2016.Balad, July 2016.Victims of the Balad attack, July 2016.Falluja, shortly after it was recaptured from ISIS, July 2016.The body of an ISIS fighter in Falluja, July 2016.An abandoned ISIS prison in Falluja, July 2016.A mosque that ISIS used as an arms depot, after an American airstrike, in Tikrit, July 2016.Refugees in Tulul al-Baq, July 2016.Refugees in Tulul al-Baq, July 2016.A refugee processing center in Hajjaj, July 2016.Refugees in Hajjaj, July 2016.Refugees in Hajjaj, 2016.Refugees in Tikrit, July 2016.Refugees in Tikrit, July 2016.\u00a0A refugee suffering heatstroke in Hajjaj, July 2016.Hajjaj, July 2016.Refugees, fleeing ISIS-held territory, near Hajjaj, July 2016.A camp for internally displaced people, Baghdad, July 2016.Hajjaj, July 2016.Hajjaj, July 2016.Refugees in Tulul al-Baq, July 2016.Tikrit, July 2016.KurdistanSee Map\u201cThey\u2019re on the high ground?

Until two weeks ago, Daesh controlled this village, and the people living here had no problem with them, they stayed throughout. We lost four pesh merga here.\u201d Azar turned to me with his lopsided, grim smile. \u201cYou know what I would do? I would go to an Arab and ask to borrow his bulldozer. Then I\u2019d bring in an Israeli adviser \u2014 they\u2019re very good at this sort of thing \u2014 and in two or three days, I would erase this place.\u201dAzar has a flair for the outrageous statement, and I sometimes found it hard to know how serious he really was in such moments. But on that morning, I suspected he was quite sincere. It was Nov. 27, 2015, six months after my first visit with Azar, and we were on a back road to Sinjar, the Yazidi town that ISIS had so thoroughly savaged in the summer of 2014. In the intervening months, Azar had occasionally driven out to the pesh merga front-line trench above Sinjar to try his hand at shooting ISIS fighters \u2014 occupying an opposing trench just 40 yards away \u2014 but the pesh merga, with the help of massive American airstrikes, had recently recaptured the town itself. Azar had participated in the battle, and this return trip put him in a dark mood.His ill temper only deepened when we reached Sinjar. Much of the town, home to perhaps 100,000 before the war, had been reduced to rubble. While still checking for booby-traps, the pesh merga had cleared a narrow path through the ruins, and here and there lay the putrefying remains of a few ISIS fighters. So great was the damage to Sinjar that it was initially difficult to differentiate between what had been destroyed by the marauding ISIS warriors during their occupation and what had been leveled in the battle two weeks earlier, but a pattern emerged. In the small traffic circle at the center of town, ISIS had destroyed the minaret that stood there for more than 800 years. They also razed every Yazidi temple in Sinjar, along with its one Christian church. The hospital in the center of town still stood, but only because ISIS converted it into a sniper\u2019s nest and barracks, knowing that American warplanes wouldn\u2019t bomb it. Even so, they had taken the time to destroy all the medical equipment, even stomping on thermometers and glass ampuls.It was in Sinjar\u2019s residential neighborhoods, however, that ISIS\u2019s policy of ethnic cleansing took on an Old Testament air. On street after street, some houses remained perfectly intact, alongside others reduced to piles of broken masonry and twisted rebar. What most of the surviving houses had in common were spray-painted messages on their exterior walls, each something to the effect of \u201cAn Arab family lives here.\u201d Azar insisted that these were written not by the ISIS invaders but by the families themselves.\u201cThis was their message to Daesh,\u201d he said. \u201c \u2018Spare us, we are with you, we aren\u2019t Kurds.\u2019 And just like in that village, the Arabs stayed here throughout.\u201dThose Arab residents were now gone, having fled when American airstrikes signaled the coming battle. On several of the residential streets, some of the few Yazidis who had returned were picking their way through the Arab homes, loading looted bedding and furniture into pickup trucks.\u201cAnd why not?\u201d Azar said. \u201cThey have lost everything.\u201dIt all became far more visceral and ghastly when two pesh merga fighters led us to a barren field a short distance out of town, near the new front lines. At the far end of the field, pesh merga engineers were cutting a tank trench \u2014 ISIS remained just a few miles to the south \u2014 but farther up, three irregular mounds flanked a seasonal water runoff. From these mounds protruded the telltale evidence of a killing field: human bones and skulls, dirt-encrusted shoes, loops of tied cloth that had been blindfolds. In the rains over the previous 15 months, some of the remains of the mass graves had leached out, so that the dry streambed was littered with women\u2019s clothes, more shoes, teeth. None of the graves had been excavated yet \u2014 the authorities were waiting for a criminal forensics team \u2014 but by best estimates, this had been the execution ground for about 300 Yazidis, most of them women too elderly to be of sex-slave interest to ISIS or children too young to be put to any use.For a half-hour, Azar walked among the graves in silence, but I noticed he was becoming increasingly agitated and then that he was crying. I drew alongside to ask if he was O.K., if he wanted to leave. He abruptly wheeled to point a finger at the steeply rising flank of Mount Sinjar, maybe four miles to the north.\u201cThe pesh merga were right up there,\u201d the doctor said, his voice ragged with rage. \u201cDaesh brought them out here to kill so that we could watch. They thought about it. They did it deliberately, to humiliate us.\u201dReturning to the center of Sinjar, Azar strode briskly into the town hall, one of the few downtown structures still habitable, and motioned for a senior official to follow him out to the terrace. For the next hour, the two men huddled in deep conversation, waving away any pesh merga underlings who thought to approach. Afterward, Azar apologized to me for having taken so long.\u201cI told him that he needed to destroy all the Arab homes here,\u201d he recounted, \u201cbut he was hesitant. He thinks it\u2019s better to give them to the Yazidis who return, but I said, \u2018No; eventually some of those Arabs will come back with their titles and deeds and try to reclaim the houses, so better to just destroy them, leave nothing for them to come back to and start over again.\u2019 He understands that now.\u201dWhen I asked if he thought the official would actually follow through with the plan, Azar nodded. \u201cHe promised me. I made him promise.\u201dThat afternoon, we climbed the hairpin road that led out of town and up Mount Sinjar, the same path that tens of thousands of terrorized Yazidis had taken in their panicked flight of August 2014. All along the shoulders of the road were clumps of the clothes, faded and torn, that they cast aside as they ran.\u201cThere used to be a lot more,\u201d Azar muttered as he looked at the detritus. \u201cIt used to be everywhere.\u201dCresting the mountain, we entered a broad valley plateau that extended for the next 25 miles. Scattered over the land were the tent encampments of thousands of Yazidi families that still had no homes to return to. The historic heart of Yazidi society wasn\u2019t the lowlands these people had so recently fled, but rather the very mountain on which they were now camped, and on the hillsides all around their tent cities were the remnants of their ancestral villages, old abandoned crop terraces and crumbling earthen homes. Some of these settlements had been inhabited for nearly a thousand years, but in the 1970s Saddam Hussein sent his soldiers in to destroy them as part of his anti-Kurd campaign. The mountain Yazidis had then been herded down to the lowlands where they could be more easily watched \u2014 and, of course, more easily slaughtered when ISIS rolled in four decades later.Until a short time ago, Azar might have been derided as a xenophobe, even a fascist, for his radical separatist views. In seeing the results of ISIS\u2019s barbarism, however, and in contemplating the hatreds that have been unleashed across the Middle East in the past few years, some observers have begun to believe that his hard way of thinking might offer the best \u2014 or, more accurately, only \u2014 path out of the morass. The despair over how impossible it seems to reassemble the shattered nations of the region has caused an ever-increasing number of diplomats and generals and statesmen to consider just the sort of ethnic and sectarian separation that Azar advocates, albeit in less brutal form. Coincidentally, the model they most often look to for how it can be done right is the Kurdistan Regional Government.For 25 years, the K.R.G. has existed as a stable quasidemocracy, part of Iraq in name only. Perhaps the answer is to replicate that model for the rest of Iraq, to create a trifurcated nation rather than the currently bifurcated one. Give the Sunnis their own \u201cSunni Regional Government,\u201d with all the accouterments the Kurds already enjoy: a head of state, internal borders, an autonomous military and civil government. Iraq could still exist on paper and a mechanism could be instituted to ensure that oil revenue is equitably divided between the three \u2014 and if it works in Iraq, perhaps this is a future solution for a Balkanized Libya or a disintegrated Syria.Even proponents acknowledge that such separations would not be easy. What to do with the thoroughly \u201cmixed\u201d populations of cities like Baghdad or Aleppo? In Iraq, many tribes are divided into Shia and Sunni subgroups, and in Libya by geographic dispersions going back centuries. Do these people choose to go with tribe or sect or homeland? In fact, parallels in history suggest that such a course would be both wrenching and murderous \u2014 witness the postwar \u201cde-Germanization\u201d policy in Eastern Europe and the 1947 partition of the Indian subcontinent \u2014 but despite the misery and potential body count entailed in getting there, maybe this is the last, best option available to prevent the failed states of the Middle East from devolving into even more brutal slaughter.The problem, though, is that once such subdividing begins, it\u2019s hard to see where it would end. Just beneath the ethnic and religious divisions that the Iraq invasion and the Arab Spring tore open are those of tribe and clan and subclan \u2014 and in this respect, the Kurdistan Regional Government appears not so much a model but a warning.Because of its two feuding tribes, the K.R.G. \u2014 a statelet the size of West Virginia \u2014 now has essentially two of everything: two leaders, two governments, two armies. For the moment this schism has been masked by the threat from ISIS and the desire to present a unified front to the outside world. But it remains an undercurrent to everything. It also goes a long way toward explaining the sad fate of the Yazidis. As Azar pointed out, any fool could see exactly where ISIS was headed in August 2014, but because the Yazidis existed outside the K.R.G. power structure, because they had no traditional alliance with either rival faction, they were left to largely fend for themselves. For all the excuses offered up by K.R.G. politicians and generals, the undeniable fact is that Sinjar simply wouldn\u2019t have happened if its residents had been named Barzani or Talabani.And what happens in the K.R.G. when the current danger subsides? If history is a guide, the Barzani-Talabani schism will worsen and may even lead to another civil war, for part of the hidden history of this place is the series of internecine battles the tribes have waged ever since they first came into contact, a legacy of mutual bloodletting dating back at least half a century and extending to as recently as the mid-1990s. It\u2019s a hidden history that the Mirkhan family knows from personal experience.Over the course of many conversations with the various Mirkhan brothers, I heard a great deal about the exploits and personalities of the two family members who lost their lives as pesh merga and who have now entered the pantheon of Kurdish martyrs: their father, Heso, and their brother, Ali. What I heard little about \u2014 and the brothers\u2019 reticence on this topic became increasingly striking \u2014 were the actual circumstances of their deaths. It was only after repeated prodding that Azar finally divulged what I\u2019d already ascertained independently: rather than by the Kurds\u2019 myriad external enemies, Heso and Ali Mirkhan were actually killed by rival Kurdish pesh merga.\u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace that Kurds should kill each other,\u201d Azar offered when I asked why he\u2019d been so reluctant to share the information. \u201cWith all the other enemies we have, how can we ever turn on each other?\u201dAn excellent question, but it is one likely to be asked again all across a partitioned Middle East, no matter how far down those divisions and subdivisions are made.At about the midpoint on the Sinjar plateau, a bend in the road suddenly revealed an exquisite village on the far side of the river: a series of houses climbing the rocky hillside and, just below them, a number of ancient stone terraces. Some of the terrace walls were more than 20 feet high, the inhabitants determined to carve out any little piece of workable land from the mountain and, built in an age before machines, must have taken years \u2014 decades, perhaps \u2014 to erect. The homes were deserted now, their roofs caved in by Saddam Hussein\u2019s soldiers, but they had left the terraces alone.\u201cIt must have been so beautiful here then,\u201d Azar said, gazing up at the village, \u201ca kind of garden.\u201dBut for Azar, the past was most useful for what it said about the future, and putting Sinjar behind us had set him in a happier, anticipatory mood. As we continued across Sinjar mountain, he drummed his fingers on the steering wheel.\u201cThis is our time now,\u201d he said. \u201cIraq is gone. Syria is gone. Now it is our time.\u201dThat said, I am reminded of something Majd Ibrahim told me: \u201cISIS isn\u2019t just an organization, it\u2019s an idea.\u201d It is also a kind of tribe, of course, and if this incarnation is destroyed, the conditions that created ISIS will remain in the form of a generation of disaffected and futureless young men, like Wakaz Hassan, who find purpose and power and belonging by picking up a gun. In short, nothing gets better anytime soon.On a more philosophical level, this journey has served to remind me again of how terribly delicate is the fabric of civilization, of the vigilance required to protect it and of the slow and painstaking work of mending it once it has been torn. This is hardly an original thought; it is a lesson we were supposed to have learned after Nazi Germany, after Bosnia and Rwanda. Perhaps it is a lesson we need to constantly relearn.Against this, I find solace in the extraordinary power of the individual to bring change, and no person that I met more exemplified this than Khulood al-Zaidi. Through sheer force of will, Khulood \u2014 the youngest daughter of a traditional family in a provincial city in Iraq \u2014 became an unlikely yet remarkable leader and in the process saved what she could of her family. Here, too, though, is a paradox: It is people like Khulood who must see to the mending of these fractured lands. Yet, it is those very people, the best their nations have to offer, who are leaving in search of a better life elsewhere. Today, Austria\u2019s gain is Iraq\u2019s loss.As I write this, the Iraqis are slowly retaking cities from ISIS across the country\u2019s central plains: Ramadi was recaptured in February, Falluja in June. Planning for a joint offensive of Iraqi and Kurdish forces against Mosul is in its advanced stages, and the strike could come as early as October. One who will most certainly play a role in that offensive is Dr. Azar Mirkhan. For Azar, however, the true struggle, of fully separating his Kurdish homeland from the Arab world, will continue in the battle\u2019s aftermath. That aftermath will also mark the end of Wakaz Hassan\u2019s usefulness to his captors; as bluntly explained by the Kurdish security officer, he will then almost surely be handed over to Iraqi authorities for execution.In Libya, Majdi el-Mangoush is continuing his engineering studies, but in contemplating the chaos engulfing his homeland, he has turned to a novel idea: a restoration of the monarchy that Qaddafi overthrew in 1969. \u201cNot that it will solve all our problems,\u201d Majdi told me, \u201cbut at least with the king, we were a nation.\u201d Whatever happens in Libya, he is committed to staying and working for its improvement. \u201cI am ready for a new kind of uncertainty,\u201d he said.In Dresden, Majd Ibrahim has been granted refugee status, which will enable him to remain in Germany for at least the next three years. Now learning German, he hopes to return to college this fall for a master\u2019s degree in hotel management.In Egypt, Laila Soueif\u2019s son, Alaa, is in the second year of his five-year prison sentence. Her daughter, Sanaa, was released in September 2015 under a presidential pardon, after having served 15 months. In May, though, she was found guilty of \u201cinsulting the judiciary\u201d for failing to answer a prosecutor\u2019s request for an interview. Given a six-month sentence, Sanaa is currently being held at a women\u2019s prison in Cairo.In Austria, Khulood and her sister Teamim continue to live with the Edelsbrunner family and were recently awarded scholarships to study intercultural management at a local university beginning in September. Not long ago, their mother, Aziza, who had never left Iraq, and whom Khulood had seen only once since she fled 11 years ago, died in Kut. Khulood\u2019s response to the news was typical of this dauntless young woman. She redoubled her efforts to rescue her remaining family, the father and sister still stranded in Jordan, and bring them to Austria. \u201cTo bring them here, to have a family again,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is my greatest dream.\u201dProduced by Linsey Fields, Danny DeBelius, Meghan Louttit, Jeannie ChoiPhoto editors: Kathy Ryan, Stacey BakerMajdi el-Mangoush, 30.

Everyone knows who is behind this,\u201d he said. \u201cSome states and their political-sports establishments looked for a traditional adversary, and they found it, as they usually do.\u201dThe prime minister also took an angry swipe at Dr. Rodchenkov, saying it \u201cis especially despicable that some scum first cram performance-enhancing drugs down their athletes\u2019 throats, take prohibited substances across the border and then bolt across the ocean to give court testimony in exchange for the promise of participation in a witness protection program and future financial dividends.\u201dWhile world antidoping authorities were examining Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s allegations and finding them credible, Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee, a rough equivalent of the F.B.I., opened a criminal case against the whistle-blower in June for \u201cabuse of authority,\u201d accusing him of being responsible for any doping by Russian athletes.Russia\u2019s case against Dr. Rodchenkov took a bizarre new twist this week when the head of the Investigative Committee\u2019s media department, Vladimir Markin, asserted that the whistle-blower was part of a conspiracy against Russia orchestrated by the World Anti-Doping Agency.It was not the Russian authorities but WADA itself, Mr. Markin said on Tuesday, that ordered Dr. Rodchenkov to tamper with the athletes\u2019 urine samples.Russia appealed the decision to ban it from the Paralympic Games to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland, but the court this week upheld the ban, setting off a wave of fury from Russian athletes and officials.State television has been flooded with interviews with weeping handicapped athletes and outraged comments over a purported Western plot to keep Russia down and humiliate even its weakest, most vulnerable citizens.A talk show on the Rossiya 1 television channel on Sunday focused on angry denunciations of Western bullying with guests shouting down one speaker who tried to suggest that Russian officials were themselves to blame because they had let doping go unchecked for so long.Oleg Matsnev and Lincoln Pigman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018It Absolutely Has Created Fear\u2019: 2 Killings Prompt Female Joggers to Alter Routines", "Date": "2016-08-09", "News": "Supported byThe two deaths occurred just days apart and had eerily similar details \u2014 each time, a woman went jogging during the day in an isolated area and wound up dead.Though one woman\u2019s body was discovered in Massachusetts and the other in Queens, and the authorities do not believe the two attacks were related, the killings have unnerved many female runners. Some are now rethinking their routines.Around 1:15 p.m. on Sunday, Vanessa Marcotte, 27, left her mother\u2019s home in Princeton, Mass., to go for a run on a wooded country road nearby, according to a spokesman with the Worcester County district attorney\u2019s office. Ms. Marcotte was visiting town from her home in New York City, where she worked as a Google marketing account manager.After she had been gone for more than two and a half hours, the police began looking for Ms. Marcotte. Later that night, a State Police canine unit found her body about a half-mile from her mother\u2019s home. The police began a homicide investigation, but have not made any arrests. An autopsy report had not been completed as of Tuesday afternoon.Police officials in New York said they did not believe the episode was related to the death last Tuesday of Karina Vetrano, 30, in the Howard Beach neighborhood. Ms. Vetrano was sexually assaulted and strangled during a run in a nature preserve near her home, the police said.The news of the two joggers\u2019 deaths has prompted anxiety among female runners in New York City and caused many to question their safety while running alone.\u201cIt absolutely has created fear,\u201d said Kathy Ioannou, leader of the Brooklyn chapter of She Runs This Town, a running group for women. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel comfortable running alone. We\u2019re frightened.\u201dMs. Ioannou, 51, said she had seen a \u201chuge spike\u201d in the last two days of women from her group asking her to set up more group runs so that members did not have to go alone.She has made changes to her own running route, choosing to run in the street against traffic instead of in the golf course near her home in Dyker Heights, Brooklyn. She has also stopped running with headphones and has not left the house without her Road ID, which contains her emergency contact information.In search of long stretches of continuous road, many runners venture to unfamiliar places so they can log more miles. Ms. Ioannou said she had been planning on going to the Howard Beach area for an 18-mile run before she heard about the attack there.\u201cIt brought light to all of us that we just can\u2019t do the things we\u2019re used to doing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t fair, but it\u2019s smart.\u201dAs the peak of the marathon season approaches, many women are leaving home early in the morning \u2014 sometimes while it is still dark \u2014 to try to squeeze long runs into their schedules, said Melody Davis, a Brooklyn resident and a member of the group Black Girls Run.\u201cWhat\u2019s really unnerving is that both of these latest situations happened in daylight,\u201d Ms. Davis said. \u201cThe question becomes, Then when can I go run?\u201dSome members of her group have suggested using phone apps that can map runners\u2019 locations so that relatives can track their whereabouts. Others have been resorting to running in groups or with a dog, she said.Gisela Perez, a Bronx resident, said she carried Mace and sometimes a safety pin to be used as a possible weapon in case of an emergency while running. She said she also tried to avoid going by herself. For other runners, like Martha Rowen, 73, jogging in groups is not an easy alternative; Ms. Rowen, who lives in Brooklyn Heights, said she had a hard time keeping up with younger runners.\u201cIt\u2019s going to probably influence how likely I am to branch out,\u201d Ms. Rowen said about the recent attacks. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m going to be able to feel I can do that.\u201dBut the killings of both Ms. Vetrano and Ms. Marcotte seem to have taken place in areas they were familiar with. And both were avid runners.The Landmark, a newspaper based in Holden, Mass., reported that in 2014, Ms. Marcotte ran in a race to raise money for cancer research, in honor of her uncle. On Tuesday, one friend posted a photo of herself and Ms. Marcotte on Facebook taking part in a race together.For the past year and a half, Ms. Marcotte had been working as an account manager in health care at Google\u2019s New York City office, according to her LinkedIn profile. In a statement, a Google spokeswoman said Ms. Marcotte was \u201cknown for her ubiquitous smile, passion for volunteer work and love of Boston sports.\u201dMs. Marcotte graduated from Boston University's College of Communication in 2011, her LinkedIn profile says, and worked in Boston before moving to New York. Several of her family and friends declined to comment.Jeff Esposito, who lives in the Boston area, worked with Ms. Marcotte for about two years at Vistaprint, a marketing company. He said Ms. Marcotte loved being outside and exercising. \u201cVanessa was a true treat to work with,\u201d he said. \u201cShe is somebody who will be truly, truly missed.\u201dMs. Davis, the runner in Brooklyn, said she hoped that the deaths of Ms. Marcotte and Ms. Vetrano would not stop women from wanting to get outside and run.\u201cI want ladies in our community to continue to do what they love,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want fear to be another deterrent.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about reactions by female runners to the recent killings of two women who were jogging misidentified a jogger who said she carries safety pins as a possible weapon. She is Gisela Perez, not Melody Davis. The article also referred incorrectly to the area where the body of Vanessa Marcotte was discovered. She was found about a half-mile from her mother\u2019s home in Princeton, Mass., not about a mile and a half from there.Susan C. Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}

Advance far enough in the game, and players are invited to join a Pok\u00e9mon team and stage face-offs at designated gyms \u2014 basically, virtual forts \u2014 where battle-ready competitors descend to hold their phones with a white-knuckle grip, stare unblinkingly at the screen and tap furiously on one another\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon in a bid to seize control of the territory.Or not. Users can also just lazily check for Pok\u00e9mon as they proceed throughout their days, stopping occasionally to scan the app for nearby characters and snapping screen shots on their commute or evening stroll. Marinate on this lower level of game play, and Pok\u00e9mon Go feels less like a competition and more like a charming little interlude.In this way, Pok\u00e9mon Go has become the rare app to unite the two extremes of the mobile gaming universe. One, the compulsive, rank-obsessed land of Candy Crush and Clash of Clans. The other, its antidote \u2014 the serene, score-free world of so-called slow games.Slow games are less ubiquitous and straightforwardly tantalizing than traditional mobile games. They often seem to lack any point at all. Instead, they invite players to engage in simpler virtual pleasures \u2014 taking a stroll, watering plants, feeding stray cats.Neko Atsume is my coping mechanism of choice. Six months after downloading the app, the simple act of checking in on my cats a few times a day has relaxed into a mindless habit embedded amid all my others \u2014 check email, check Twitter, feed cats. I\u2019ve already collected each of Neko Atsume\u2019s 56 cats \u2014 the ostensible point of the game \u2014 but I keep playing. It\u2019s evolved from game into ritual, or even atmosphere. It\u2019s the new smoke break.But in another way, slow games are less a rejection of high-octane internet culture than they are a capitulation to it. By freeing up gamers from the burdens of extreme concentration and physical control, slow games allow us to fit a mobile game into every spare moment, to seamlessly multitask among Facebook monitoring and texting and the game play.Slow games offer a release, but their escape is on a screen, too. Run out of lives in Candy Crush and you can check on your aloe plant, tend your garden and feed the cats.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.E., the 124-Year-Old Software Start-Up", "Date": "2016-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt may not qualify as a lightning-bolt eureka moment, but Jeffrey R. Immelt, chief executive of General Electric, recalls the June day in 2009 that got him thinking. He was speaking with G.E. scientists about new jet engines they were building, laden with sensors to generate a trove of data from every flight \u2014 but to what end?That data could someday be as valuable as the machinery itself, if not more so. But G.E. couldn\u2019t make use of it.But in 2011, G.E. also quietly opened a software center in San Ramon, Calif., 24 miles east of San Francisco, across the bay.Today one of San Ramon\u2019s most important projects is to build a computer operating system, but on an industrial scale \u2014 a Microsoft Windows or Google Android for factories and industrial equipment. The project is central to G.E.\u2019s drive to become what Mr. Immelt says will be a \u201ctop 10 software company\u201d by 2020.Silicon Valley veterans are skeptical.Many industries see digital threats, of course. Yet the scope of the challenge is magnified at G.E., a 124-year-old company and the nation\u2019s largest manufacturer, with more than 300,000 employees worldwide. Employees companywide have been making pilgrimages to San Ramon for technology briefings, but also to soak in the culture. Their marching orders are to try to adapt the digital wizardry and hurry-up habits of Silicon Valley to G.E.\u2019s world of industrial manufacturing.6 PhotosG.E.\u2019s success or failure over the next decade, Mr. Immelt says, depends on this transformation. He calls it \u201cprobably the most important thing I\u2019ve worked on in my career.\u201dApparently, there is no Plan B. \u201cIt\u2019s this or bust,\u201d he said.The march of digital technology \u2014 mainly inexpensive sensors, powerful computing and clever software \u2014 into the industrial world has been underway for years under the guise of \u201cthe internet of things\u201d or \u201cthe industrial internet.\u201d It is the next battlefield as companies fight to develop the dominant software layer that connects the machines.It promises to be a huge market for new products, improved service and efficiency gains in industries like energy, transportation and health care. By 2020, the industrial internet market will reach $225 billion, G.E. executives predicted in a recent meeting with analysts.So far, a major application has been predictive maintenance. Software analyzes the data generated by a machine to identify early warning signals that it needs repair, before it breaks down.The data volumes are exploding as machines new and old spawn sensors. By 2020, G.E. estimates that the data flowing off its machines in use will jump a hundredfold. That should enable far more detailed analysis, giving G.E. a chance to sell its customers not machines but \u201cbusiness outcomes,\u201d like fuel savings. Mr. Immelt sees this as a move up the industrial food chain.Yet all of this exposes G.E. to new competition beyond its traditional rivals like Rockwell Automation, Siemens and United Technologies. Tech giants, including Amazon, Cisco, Google, IBM and Microsoft also have their eye on the industrial internet market, as do a bevy of start-ups.There is precedent for trouble in other industries, of course. Google and Facebook transformed media and advertising, Amazon redefined retailing, and Uber applied an entirely new business model to taxis, which hadn\u2019t changed much in generations.\u201cThe real danger is that the data and analysis becomes worth more than the installed equipment itself,\u201d said Karim R. Lakhani, a professor at the Harvard Business School. \u201cG.E. has no choice but to try to do that itself.\u201dUntil this year, Darren Haas hadn\u2019t thought about G.E., certainly not working there. To him, G.E. meant little more than than kitchen appliances and light bulbs. \u201cI had no idea,\u201d Mr. Haas said.But he was intrigued after he met with Harel Kodesh, an expert in mobile and cloud computing who led teams at Microsoft and VMware, a maker of data-center software. Less than two years ago, Mr. Kodesh joined G.E., and he is now chief technology officer of GE Digital.That someone of Mr. Kodesh\u2019s caliber was a G.E. convert got Mr. Haas\u2019s attention. Then, Mr. Haas started grasping the role that G.E. equipment plays across the economy \u2014 in transportation, in hospitals \u2014 \u201ca whole world,\u201d he said. \u201cI found that really, really compelling.\u201dThe other thing Mr. Haas, 41, found appealing was the big computing challenge that lies ahead for the company. In May, he joined G.E. from Apple, where he was a member of the founding team at Siri, the voice-based digital assistant start-up Apple acquired in 2010. When he left Apple, Mr. Haas was head of cloud engineering, managing the computing engine behind Siri, iTunes and iCloud.At GE Digital, Mr. Haas has a similar title, head of platform cloud engineering, but in a different setting. He describes his job as applying modern software technology \u2014 machine learning, artificial intelligence and cloud computing \u2014 to the industrial arena. \u201cI\u2019ve got my work cut out for me,\u201d he said.Mr. Haas is working on the centerpiece of G.E.\u2019s software strategy, a product called Predix. Its evolution mirrors G.E.\u2019s software ambitions.Predix began as little more than a brand of software used by G.E. to service the gear it sells. One showcase use was in jet engines to do predictive maintenance, saving downtime. Around 2013, William Ruh, a former Cisco Systems executive brought in to put together the San Ramon software center, started expanding Predix to other G.E. industrial businesses.But that soon felt too small. The issue was \u201coutside disrupters,\u201d Mr. Ruh said, citing the online lodging start-up Airbnb as an example of rivals that can appear seemingly out of nowhere and that \u201cbring greater productivity \u2014 but don\u2019t own the assets they sell.\u201d G.E., Mr. Ruh notes, is the ultimate big-asset company.The other threat was rising interest among tech companies to take their internet connectivity expertise and try to apply it to industrial businesses. To get ahead of all this, G.E. reimagined Predix as a cloud-based operating system for industrial applications.Mr. Kodesh leads that effort. He ticks off the looming competitors: Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and others. \u201cThose companies are going to encroach on the territory,\u201d Mr. Kodesh said. \u201cAre we going to capitulate, or build something like Predix?\u201dThe basic idea is that G.E. and outside software developers will write programs to run on Predix. This software might, for instance, monitor the health and fine-tune the operation of equipment like oil-field rigs and wind-farm turbines, improving performance, reducing wear and adapting to changing environmental conditions. It amounts to software delivering the equivalent of personalized medicine for machines.Like any other computer operating system, Predix aims to take the complexity out of writing programs, so more people can create them. And while the instincts of the industrial world are proprietary, G.E. is following an open-source model with Predix, providing a basic design, but one open to outside contributors \u2014 more like Android from Google than Windows from Microsoft.Predix, Mr. Kodesh said, will be improved using the software equivalent of Lego blocks. \u201cSome will be G.E.\u2019s, and some will be made by third-party developers,\u201d he said.G.E. is betting that its deep knowledge of industry will give it an edge in this software arms race. The stakes for this kind of programming can be high.For a regular consumer using the internet, a misfiring algorithm in the software \u2014 \u201ca false positive\u201d \u2014 might mean a person sees an irrelevant online ad, or a bad Amazon book suggestion or Netflix movie recommendation, Mr. Kodesh said. Useless, perhaps, but not necessarily costly. But a false positive that prompts an airline to take a jet engine off the wing, Mr. Kodesh said, is a $100,000 mistake.\u201cWe really do need to have different technology, different algorithms and a different cloud, than in the consumer internet,\u201d he said.G.E. has set an ambitious target for Predix. It hopes to attract $100 million in orders this year, on its way to $4 billion in revenue by 2020. By then, the company forecasts that its total digital business \u2014 more than 90 percent of it software \u2014 may reach as much as $15 billion, up from $6 billion now.For Predix to reach its potential, though, G.E. needs outside programmers to write software for it. The company, with its deep pockets, can start the software-writing parade, but will others follow?This will be a major test. And G.E.\u2019s campaign to build an industrial operating system and create a flourishing ecosystem of software for it is just getting underway in earnest.In late July, G.E. hosted a Predix conference in Las Vegas, which attracted 1,200 software developers. Such developer gatherings are part of the playbook of every major software company but unusual for an industrial corporation.G.E. has some built-in advantages. Its installed base is huge. For example, the company says more than a third of the world\u2019s electricity is generated on G.E. equipment. It can make progress simply by winning over the aircraft makers, oil companies, hospitals and utilities that now depend on G.E. machinery.G.E. is starting to attract a developer following. Tata Consultancy Services, for one, says it now has 500 programmers designing and developing Predix applications for customers in the electric-utility, aviation and health care industries. G.E. also promotes partnerships with Infosys, Wipro and Capgemini to help business write Predix software.When he joined in 2011, Mr. Ruh had no illusions that making software a strength at a heavy-industry company would be easy. At the time, he told Mr. Immelt that would be \u201ca 10-year journey,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of that journey.\u201dPart of that is an effort to change an engineering culture that stretches back generations. \u201cIf G.E. is truly going to be a digital-industrial company, we can\u2019t be separate here,\u201d Mr. Ruh said of his software division. Digital \u201ctools and habits\u201d need to be embedded \u201cin how people do their jobs,\u201d he said.In its factory in Greenville, S.C., G.E. produces both giant power generators and evidence that this metamorphosis might work.The three-story building is crowded with immense cranes and milling, grinding and welding machines, overseen by manufacturing engineers and technicians. The finishing touches are being put on one of G.E.\u2019s new gas turbines.It looks like the business end of a rocket ship lying on its side, a gleaming steel dynamo at rest. It weighs 950,000 pounds. It fires up at nearly 2,900 degrees Fahrenheit, and it can generate enough electricity to supply more than 500,000 households.The gas turbine was brought to market in half the typical five years. That kind of accelerated product development is a performance that G.E. hopes to replicate across its industrial businesses. And it is a story of changes in design and manufacturing practices made possible by digital technology.John Lammas, the 56-year-old vice president for power generation engineering, started his working career 40 years ago, on the shop floor of a Rolls-Royce jet engine factory in Birmingham, England. He has been with G.E. for 31 years, moving up the ranks of the company\u2019s jet engine and power turbine divisions.\u201cI\u2019m an old mechanical guy,\u201d he said. But a couple of years ago, he issued an edict: no more paper drawings.In the past, a model of a new part would be made and then converted to detailed blueprints running to 70 pages or more. These would then be physically sent to G.E. manufacturing engineers and outside suppliers to begin setting up the tooling, casting and cutting for the part.This prototype-and-blueprint routine took up to eight weeks. Now, engineers use 3-D computer models, skip the prototype step and instantly send the models electronically.This goes a step beyond computer-aided design, which is commonplace. In Greenville, the designers are for the first time linked directly with manufacturers and suppliers in real time, in what G.E. calls a \u201cdigital thread.\u201d This means they can collaborate in ways that have changed the work process while making it more likely that problems or defects are spotted sooner.Traditionally, one set of engineers designed a part, and only then passed it on to manufacturing. If a problem arose on the supplier side, the design was kicked back and the process started over. \u201cJobs are combining in this digital world,\u201d Mr. Lammas said.Greenville\u2019s own equipment has been a Predix guinea pig. The machinery and factory were retrofitted with data-generating sensors and the software. Matt Krause, the plant manager, said that last winter, when a snowstorm shut the factory for a day, the sensor network detected that the plant had consumed 1,000 pounds of argon, an inert gas used in coatings for parts. The leak was fixed, saving $350,000 a year.\u201cWe can see things we never did before,\u201d Mr. Krause said. Over all, 60 of 200 steps in design and production have been automated or eliminated, reducing work time by 530,000 hours over three years, G.E. estimates.Not all the start-up ideas that G.E. is trying to breed translate comfortably to heavy industry. Lean proponents urge companies to come up with \u201cminimum viable products,\u201d particularly test versions of software programs. But no one wants a minimum viable jet engine or power generator.Yet in Greenville, engineers in the design stages are encouraged to move faster in smaller steps, conduct more experiments, and be willing to fail and try again. It amounts to a sea change in the engineering culture of heavy industry.\u201cAs an engineer, not getting it right the first time, I find painful,\u201d said Bill Byrne, an engineering manager. \u201cIt\u2019s uncomfortable. But it\u2019s been incredibly liberating.\u201dThe old ways, said Mr. Lammas, the engineering chief, had merit. Each step and rule was logical on its own. But the emphasis on flawless execution and perfection fostered a fear of failure. \u201cOvercoming that culture was probably the biggest challenge,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shocker! Facebook Changes Its Algorithm to Avoid \u2018Clickbait\u2019", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacebook says it plans to marginalize what it considers to be \u201cclickbait\u201d news stories from publishers in its news feed, in another step to keep its 1.71 billion members regularly coming back to its social network.\u201cWe want publishers to post content that people care about, and we think people care about headlines that are much more straightforward,\u201d Adam Mosseri, Facebook\u2019s vice president for product management for the news feed, said in an interview.Thursday\u2019s announcement goes a step further. Facebook spent months classifying phrases commonly used in clickbait headlines. Mr. Mosseri offered examples like \u201cThe Dog Barked at the Deliveryman and His Reaction Was Priceless,\u201d or \u201cWhen She Looked Under Her Couch Cushions and Saw THIS \u2026 I Was SHOCKED!\u201dThe company\u2019s algorithms then took note of the websites from which the articles were coming, and could detect patterns of traffic coming from those sites over time. That process was then automated, and content identified as clickbait will now appear lower in the news feed than before. Mr. Mosseri likened the practice to a kind of email spam filtering process.The move will most likely heighten the anxiety of publishers that rely heavily on Facebook for traffic and often complain about having little insight into the company\u2019s decision-making on how its all-powerful algorithm functions.The social network\u2019s vast user base and sophisticated targeting capabilities allow publishers to reach new audiences far beyond the direct traffic a media company receives at its own site. As a result, Facebook has been able to largely dictate the terms on which it engages with publishers, which have few other options for distributing their articles.Julie Hansen, the president and chief operating officer of the online publication Business Insider, said it would take Facebook\u2019s latest algorithm change under consideration.\u201cWe don\u2019t do what we consider to be clickbaity headlines,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we\u2019ll certainly consider Facebook\u2019s guidance when we look to post our content onto Facebook and adapt the headlines if needed.\u201dFacebook said that publishers that have clickbaitlike headlines and are ranked lower because of the algorithm change will have the opportunity to change their ways and rise again in the rankings.Some publishers are now betting on a future beyond total reliance on Facebook, as companies like Snapchat and Google offer media companies other avenues to distribute their work.\u201cToday we\u2019re at peak Facebook \u2014 Facebook dominates everything,\u201d said Zachary Kaplan, a vice president at the investment firm General Atlantic, which has invested in digital media companies like BuzzFeed and Vox Media.\u201cWe will naturally evolve to a place where there will be more competition among digital distributors,\u201d he said, \u201cand that would result in, naturally, more leverage for publishers.\u201dFor now, Facebook said it planned to improve relationships with publishers by becoming more transparent about its news feed practices. Mr. Mosseri regularly meets with publishers to discuss algorithm changes.\u201cIt\u2019s becoming clear to us how there\u2019s a lot of anxiety over what we do,\u201d Mr. Mosseri said. \u201cI spend a lot of time trying to ease that anxiety.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Harry Potter is a father now, and one question this book will answer is how the Boy Who Lived \u00e2\u0080\u0094 when his parents didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u0094 handles that role. As an orphan, Harry himself could operate free of the burden a parent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fears, love and expectation can place on a person. Now, as a parent, he has to confront it.For readers who started reading these books when the first one came out nearly 20 years ago and grew up with Harry and friends, the scenes that reveal the characters as adults are the ones we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been waiting for. Though the story has serious themes, the sheer fun of returning to the familiar magical world is a delight. And there are certainly moments when real-life parents can fantasize about the possibility of a magical assist. Imagine being able to use a spell like \u00e2\u0080\u009cAccio Binky!\u00e2\u0080\u009d to return a dropped pacifier to the sleeping baby, or \u00e2\u0080\u009cExpelliarmus Mobilio!\u201d to expel a mobile phone right out of a teenager\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand. Molly Brennan, a mother of two attending a book release party on Saturday night at Watchung Booksellers in Montclair, N.J., suggested a spell called Behavioramus. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would dodge it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said her son, Logan Brown, 9. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI like my behavior how it is.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBecky Middleton of Glen Ridge, N.J., who has four children ages 6, 9, 9 and 11, said her spell of choice would be volume control. Rob Fechner of Montclair, the father of two boys ages 7 and 10, asked for a spell \u00e2\u0080\u009cto pause time so I could get stuff done and take a nap.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s giving nothing away to say that none of those abilities seem likely to make raising children any simpler for Harry, Ginny, Hermione and Ron. As Julia Miner, a mother of three who lives outside Washington, D.C., said Sunday, when she was up to page 70 of \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Cursed Child,\u00e2\u0080\u009d parenting teenagers has challenges no matter who you are. Magic has never helped much with relationships in the Harry Potter universe, and the fact that wizards face some of the same bitter limits that Muggles do has always been a part of the series\u00e2\u0080\u0099 appeal.But for many parents and children in this universe,  the books are conversation\u00e2\u0080\u0093starters that help connect us, engaging us in the same world.

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "On what is likely the most diverse college campus in the United States, Muslim women who wear a hijab talk about their lives.Last spring, two students there, Hamna Saleem and Dina Sayedahmed, were engaged in a Newest Americans-inspired journalism class when they saw a viral video featuring non-Muslim women wearing the hijab for a day and recounting their experiences. The video was intended as a show of solidarity, but Ms. Saleem and Ms. Sayedahmed found it offensive. They resented non-Muslim women taking license to speak on their behalf. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese women don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go to their job interviews with hijab on; they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go to class with it; they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to move into new neighborhoods wearing it and have to convince people that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re \u00e2\u0080\u0098normal,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Sayedahmed said.Different Ways to wear the hijab.That led her and Ms. Saleem to interview several friends about their experiences as real hijabis. Prof. Tim Raphael, who runs the center, shared their film with my husband, the photojournalist Ed Kashi, and me, and we immediately saw the potential to capture their voices in a visually compelling way. Ed envisioned having these young women talk directly into the camera in deference to their need to speak for themselves. The format also suited their unvarnished intensity on the topic. To avoid having them appear static or wooden \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and draining energy from the narrative \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we set them in motion in the very environment where they struggle to blend in: public, heavily trafficked areas. On a typical shoot day, our technical crew is a spectacle, but traipsing through downtown Newark with a gaggle of hijabis \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one of whom was on a bicycle \u00e2\u0080\u0094 was a near traffic-stopping event. Heads turned, eyebrows raised and questions flowed. One bypasser shouted at one of our subjects to \u00e2\u0080\u009ctell the truth\u00e2\u0080\u009d about being oppressed. More often, fellow Muslims made eye contact with the women and offered a friendly \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs Salaam Alaikum.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In a moment of na\u00c3\u00afve optimism we tried to film at Liberty State Park in Jersey City, only to be stopped immediately by park police and shuffled back into our car. Another day, the arrival of a New Jersey Transit train provided a happy accident for our opening shot.If you have ever worn a hijab or even walked around with someone who does, you can feel the undercurrent of tension it elicits on American streets. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHijabi World\u00e2\u0080\u009d allows young Muslim women to express what it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like coming of age in America in a time of xenophobia. The film allows them to set the record straight about when and why they started to wear the head scarf and to answer for themselves how they balance American feminism with cultural and religious tradition.

It\u2019s a grim, detailed, quotidian drama about the inner workings of organized crime (which has drawn comparisons to \u201cThe Wire\u201d) and at the same time it\u2019s a traditional Mafia saga, a clan melodrama centering on succession and the ups and downs of the family business (which has drawn comparisons to \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d and \u201cThe Godfather\u201d). Either of these by itself might not be very interesting, but the combination is handled so adroitly that the show sucks you in. It doesn\u2019t have the emotional or stylistic highs of those predecessors, but it carries you along like one of the sleek Italian motorcycles preferred by its wealthier characters.The 12-episode first season (a second has already been shown in Europe) centers on two members of a drug gang in the Naples suburbs who are like a foster-family version of Sonny and Michael Corleone. Gennaro (Salvatore Esposito) is a Sonny-like hothead, unfit to be in charge but eventually thrust into the role because he\u2019s the only son of the boss. Ciro (Marco D\u2019Amore, whose quiet charisma holds your attention) is a coldly efficient killer and canny strategist \u2014 he\u2019s the Michael, but because he\u2019s not in the family, he has to work with Gennaro, or appear to.The relationship of these two up-and-comers, playing out amid a large cast of other familiar Mafia-drama types (the ruthless but declining boss, the calculating mother, the good soldier, the aggrieved wife), proceeds through an arc of increasingly operatic violence, as rival clans fight for turf and one massacre begets another. The story line is dark, and so is the screen. Under the guidance of the showrunner, Stefano Sollima, the show makes a fetish of low light and shadow. Its most characteristic scenes are not chases and shootouts but small groups of nervous or celebratory men meeting in the dark. They gather on street corners, in crowded discos and in abandoned buildings that serve as drug markets, their faces obscured or invisible. Even during the day, they\u2019re in curtained rooms or prison cells.The cinematography and lighting fit with the show\u2019s overall sense of desolation, a depiction of the Neapolitan environment as rubble-filled, overgrown and derelict. (Scenes set in Milan offer a pointed comparison to the less prosperous south.) Much of the action is set in faceless, towering apartment blocks that recall the settings of Italian neorealist films, though touches of lyricism creep in, like a beach scene in which a pair of horse carts passing in the background feel like early Fellini.Mr. Sollima and his colleagues are certainly aware of the many influences to be sorted through in making a modern gangster tale. At one point a young hood, describing the botched job that got him imprisoned, says that cops and helicopters arrived \u201cjust like an American movie.\u201d In \u201cGomorrah,\u201d they\u2019ve achieved a satisfying international blend.Advertisement"}

When a fire started late Tuesday night in the maternity wing of one of Baghdad\u2019s main hospitals, it quickly engulfed the babies\u2019 room. And then, in another Iraqi tragedy in a horrifying line of preventable ones, nothing worked.Hospital workers raced to save the infants, but no one could find the keys to unlock the nursery. Inexplicably, no nurses seemed to be inside. Apparently, none of the fire extinguishers functioned. It took nearly an hour and a half for firefighters to arrive.Some thought the initial cause may have been an oxygen tank explosion that set off an electrical fire. But on Wednesday morning, only one thing was certain: At least 13 infants were dead, and with them a small piece of Iraq\u2019s future.There was Yaman Muaad, a baby boy born by cesarean section on Tuesday who died a few hours later. There was Jafar Kahtan, a baby being treated for breathing difficulties. There was Zahra Hussein, a baby girl born on Monday, whose grandfather was frantically looking for her on Wednesday.Many more were still unaccounted for. And at least 25 people, mostly infants, were being treated for burns or smoke inhalation.All Iraqi officials could manage was what they typically do in the face of tragedy: establish a committee.\u201cA committee has been formed to investigate the incident, and so far we don\u2019t know the reasons of the incident,\u201d Dr. Ahmed al-Hadari, a spokesman for the Health Ministry, said at a news conference on Wednesday. \u201cWe are awaiting the results of the investigations.\u201dAfter years of unsolved tragedy and unanswered demands for improvements, hardly anyone here believes official promises anymore.\u201cSuch tragedies have become normal to Iraqi officials, and this case will be closed, just as the other ones,\u201d said Adnan Hussein, the acting editor in chief at Al Mada, one of Baghdad\u2019s daily newspapers.In their agony and tears as they gathered outside Yarmouk hospital on Wednesday morning, families of the dead babies were inconsolable. Some even made accusations of arson, though there was no evidence to support that claim.\u201cThere was screaming,\u201d said Mariam Thijeel, the mother of Yaman, describing the scene at the hospital early Wednesday. \u201cThe power was cut off, and then the doors got locked on us, and there was no man in the newborn section, and we could not save any babies.\u201dShe described a scene of panic and chaos, and said that people in the hospital had tried desperately to find someone with keys to the hospital wing that was on fire, the doors of which were locked. \u201cWe asked the help of one of the employees, but she said, \u2018I cannot help you with anything, because it\u2019s a fire,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Thijeel said.Zainab Ali, Jafar\u2019s mother, said: \u201cToday I have come to see him and I was told, \u2018A fire happened in the newborn unit, and your baby died.\u2019\u201d She said she had heard that none of the fire extinguishers worked.A third mother, Shayma Husain, came to the hospital looking for her infant son, Haider Mohammad Azeez, who had not been accounted for. Angry and tearful, she compared the leaders of the government-run hospital to the militants of the Islamic State \u2014 saying, in effect, that politicians and terrorists were both responsible for Iraq\u2019s endless trauma.Many Iraqis say the state\u2019s dysfunction is caused by a political system the Americans helped establish that is based on sectarian quotas. People are given jobs in ministries based on patronage and sect, not competence, and corruption is rampant.\u201cWe have good medical competence and good doctors, but there are problems and defects in the state administration,\u201d Mr. Saadawi said. \u201cThey always put the wrong people in the important places.\u201dIn that attack, many more died from the fire than from the bomb blast, and in the aftermath officials blamed poor safety procedures and a lack of fire exits for the number of deaths.Like the bombing, the fire at the hospital would probably have been less deadly had the government put in place adequate safety measures or responded sooner.\u201cI was at the incident today and saw the disaster with my own eyes,\u201d said Mohammed al-Rubaie, a member of the security committee on Baghdad\u2019s provincial council. \u201cThere was clear negligence from the administration of the hospital, and there were no safety measures.\u201dThere were no protests in Baghdad on Wednesday as there were after last month\u2019s terrorist attack, only muted outrage and a tragic sense of familiarity.He added, \u201cOh my God, what a big crime today.\u201dThere was also the usual violence on Tuesday and Wednesday, the sort that has long been a feature of the city\u2019s routines. According to the Interior Ministry, a suicide car bombing at a checkpoint in the neighborhood of Dora killed four soldiers and injured 11 people; a roadside bomb killed four people at a public market in the Nahrawan district; and a suicide bomber killed four soldiers in the Rasheed district.As Mr. Hussein, the newspaper editor, put it: There is \u201cno safe place in Iraq at all.\u201dFalih Hassan and Omar Al-Jawoshy reported from Baghdad, and Tim Arango from Istanbul.Advertisement"}

Or walked lighter in them. Or wore them on my hands instead of my feet.I realized early on that he was (mostly) joking, yet I knew he was also imparting a very important lesson to me. As a young adult in the 1980s, we disposed of things way before they were ready to be thrown out, because supplies were infinite, or so we thought. And here we are in 2016, having disposed of the disposable era, and we are once again exploring how to make the most of what we have.Ned White seems to understand that lesson too, and he\u2019s back with a puzzle that drives that point home.Mr. White offers us a set of four familiar noun phrases and adds the word IT to the end of them to make a completely different phrase which is clued punnily:17A: YES WE CAN + IT = YES WE CAN IT (Hormel\u2019s assurance that Spam is packed safely?)29A: SWING BAND + IT = SWING BANDIT (Playground equipment thief?)38A: SHORT STOP + IT = SHORT \u201cSTOP IT!\u201d (\u201cEnough!\u2019 as opposed to \u201cYou quit that right now!\u201d?)48A: EMILY POST + IT = \u201cEMILY POST IT\u201d (\u201cMiss Dickinson, put your poem on Facebook\u201d?)We have an apt revealer at 62A, MAKE IT LAST, which tells solvers exactly where to put IT. I\u2019m sorry, let me try that again: the revealer is there to remind you that we are adding IT to the base phrase.\u2022 61A: I first ran across the ELOI in crossword puzzles, but it wasn\u2019t until The Boy developed a passion for H.G. Wells\u2019s novels and we read \u201cThe Time Machine\u201d together that I really understood who the ELOI were.\u2022 67A: That\u2019s right: the Broadway musical \u201cRent\u201d was based on Puccini\u2019s opera \u201cLa Boh\u00e8me.\u201d\u2022 39D: I hit a speed bump here. I know the blood types with the letter at the end, so I kept wanting this to be TYPE O rather than O TYPE.56D: Not what you think. A \u201cLittle hooter\u201d is an OWLET.This puzzle germinated with a failed theme entry, THE BIG DIGIT (\u201cWhat was often extended by angry motorists during Boston\u2019s Artery/Tunnel Project?\u201d), which I knew to be phonetically inconsistent, but tried submitting anyway. No go! But Will liked the theme and other entries, so I kept at it, aiming more for \u201cchuckle value\u201d in the theme answers than complexity.I see that this puzzle has an appallingly low \u201cfreshness factor,\u201d (I think a record low for me) so it should play fairly easily. Will redid the NE and bits and pieces on the west side (MERCH at 5-Across \u2014 a debut \u2014 is also his). My original had SSNS at 19-Across, and I know better than that now: don\u2019t pluralize abbreviations if you can at all avoid it! I\u2019m also becoming much more averse to partials and abbreviations in general.One note about what I\u2019ve seen evolve with themed puzzles in the last few years: The grid should feature at least two, if not four, lengthy non-theme Down entries (10 or 11 letters) crossing through two or three themers to keep the word count down and spice up the fill. That\u2019s a good standard, if sometimes challenging, and I believe it really boosts the quality of the solving experience.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Talking to Terrorists", "Date": "2016-08-09", "News": "Supported byI\u2019ve been talking to terrorists as part of my beat on and off for the past four years.Except for one Qaeda spokesman who operated in the ribbon of sand between Mali and Libya and allowed me and other journalists to call him on his cellphone, nearly all the interactions have been via social media: We exchanged direct messages on Twitter and Facebook, or on encrypted apps like Telegram, Threema and Kik.These jihadists presented themselves to me using names I knew were not the ones on their birth certificates. Their profile pictures were never real images of them; one Qaeda operative with whom I spent months exchanging messages appeared as a silhouette of a hooded man holding a sword that dripped with blood.And all this time, I struggled with one of the basic rules of journalism: Could I be sure these men were who they said they were? Often I was able to confirm their identities only after they had died in drone strikes and the terror group released a martyrdom video or statement. I came to know well the jihadists with whom I corresponded the longest, and the details they shared, including statements before they were officially released by their respective organizations, convinced me that they were indeed who they said they were. But knowing something in your gut and being able to prove it in accordance with the standards of my profession are two different things, so the majority of these jihadists were never quoted in my articles.During a short trip to southern Turkey in late 2014, several defectors from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, agreed to meet me in malls and smoke-filled cafes. I finally had real human beings in front of me, but they again refused to give their real names. And when I tried to corroborate their accounts, almost nothing they said could be verified. Colleagues shared stories of fixers who paid Syrians to pose as members of the Islamic State, coaching them on what to say, which made the exercise even more fraught.But as a reporter who is energized by being in the field, I felt frustrated by the lack of human contact.In Germany last week, I finally had a chance to meet an Islamic State operative whose identity and membership in the terror group was independently confirmed by investigators and through a propaganda video he filmed in Syria, showing him alongside other German recruits taking part in a staged execution of prisoners.How I got the interview was partly a fluke: A longtime source whose opinion I value pointed me to the case of Harry Sarfo, and encouraged me to dig into his story. That\u2019s because Mr. Sarfo was not just a run-of-the-mill member of the Islamic State; he was recruited into its grueling special forces training camp, where foot soldiers live in caves and spend hours running, jumping and crawling through the desert, all on less than one glass of water a day. Crucially, because of his German nationality and because he used to live in London, Mr. Sarfo was aggressively courted by a secretive unit inside the organization responsible for dispatching foreigners to carry out attacks in Europe. He repeatedly said no to them, he later recounted. But as they continued to try to entice him, he learned key details about the goals and day-to-day functioning of the covert unit, known as the Emni, from the Arabic word for security.So last month, I flew to northern Germany and took a train to the city of Bremen. There I met the German intelligence agent who had debriefed Mr. Sarfo soon after his arrest in July 2015. The agent, Hazim Fouad, described how Mr. Sarfo spoke nonstop for 90 minutes, as the coffee put out for him in a Styrofoam cup went cold. Later, through a different source, I was able to get the more than 500 pages of his interrogation transcript and saw for myself the enormous detail he provided, down to how the water tank at the special forces training camp had been \u201cpainted\u201d in mud to be invisible to drones.Other reporters, including those from the BBC and the Independent, had interviewed Mr. Sarfo remotely, sending questions to his lawyer, who in turn took them to Mr. Sarfo\u2019s cell, where he prepared handwritten responses. One German TV station and one German radio station had gotten in-person interviews, but they focused heavily on what was of interest to a German public: Mr. Sarfo\u2019s radicalization at a local mosque, his interaction with well-known German jihadists in Syria, and the Islamic State\u2019s desire to attack Germany.To me, Mr. Sarfo presented a golden opportunity to understand the terror group\u2019s plan for creating a global portfolio of killers.I met Mr. Sarfo\u2019s jovial attorney, Udo W\u00fcrtz, in his stately office, decorated with African art. I asked him if I could get into the jail for an extended sit-down interview, and he gave me the number of an official in Germany\u2019s ministry of justice. We reached out, expecting to be stonewalled, as has happened time and again when I have tried to interview Islamic State and Qaeda prisoners in American jails. Our luck was good: We requested the interview just days before Mr. Sarfo ended one year in solitary confinement. He was released into the general prison population on Friday, July 29. To my surprise, the ministry said I could meet with him three days later, on Monday, August 1.The prison had reserved the room normally used for conjugal visits for our interview. Over the course of three hours, my video colleagues moved the couch, took down the drapes and strung lights from the ceiling to turn it into a studio.I spent that time visiting the jail with its warden, Gerd Koop. When I met Mr. Koop, I understood why this incredible opportunity had fallen into our laps. A plaque outside the maximum-security facility summed up its philosophy: \u201cThere is no better way to awaken the good in people than to treat them as if they were already good.\u201dAlthough the prison holds convicted murderers, and now a member of the Islamic State\u2019s elite killing squad, I saw no handcuffs or ankle chains. Cell doors are encased in glass rather than bars, because Mr. Koop says studies have shown that cage-like enclosures foster aggression. There are exercise rooms with stationary bikes and pull-up bars on every floor, and a track across the beautiful grounds where you can hear birds singing. With the exception of the 10 prisoners in solitary confinement, inmates are free to come and go. There\u2019s an annual film festival that\u2019s open to the community where inmates sit side-by-side with the general public, wearing civilian clothes.When Mr. Sarfo walked into our makeshift studio, he beamed a smile. He warmly shook our hands. I sat close enough to touch him.Advertisement"}

He said that things started routinely at 1 p.m. with about 5,000 floaters but that winds began to pick up, to as much as 30 miles per hour by 4 p.m., sending more and more people drifting off course.The Canadian Coast Guard, with help from the Ontario Provincial Police, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Canadian Coast Guard Auxiliary and the Sarnia and Point Edward Fire Departments, helped the floaters as they headed toward Sarnia, said Carol Launderville, a spokeswoman for the Canadian Coast Guard.Canadians, befitting their reputation as polite and helpful, handled the unexpected guests with good cheer, Mr. Kimball said.\u201cThe Canadian people, bless their souls, handled it lightheartedly,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of smiling.

In her teens, she rose to the top of her sport in the U.S. By 22, she became the first American to win an Olympic gold medal in judo. Despite her accolades, the Middletown, Ohio, native hasn\u2019t been very visible in her home country because most judo matches aren\u2019t aired on TV in the U.S.But technology is quickly changing that: Judo is among the 41 sports of the summer games in Rio de Janeiro that people are able to watch anytime, anywhere, on almost any device. And while fans are watching judo matches, they\u2019ll be able to view Harrison\u2019s stats on sports apps like NBC Olympics and NBC Sports Live Extra.The summer games are the latest examples of how sports TV watching is going digital, completely transforming into an immersive viewing experience. Websites, apps and technologies like TV Everywhere \u2014 a term for the authenticated viewing of broadcast shows from channels people subscribe to on cable or satellite networks \u2014 enable fans to have a deeper, more engaged and interactive experience with sports.The new technologies also enable people to discover and become rabid fans of sports that they previously didn\u2019t have access to, like archery and canoeing. And that means they\u2019re interacting more with the athletes of those sports.Take judo, for instance. Since the sport\u2019s matches aired on multiple devices during the summer games in 2012, Harrison\u2019s fan base has grown. She now has over 15,000 Twitter followers and nearly 21,000 Instagram followers.\u201cThe greater visibility, more TV time and the more athletes who become household names, the better for the sport,\u201d Harrison said. This year, NBC will broadcast and/or live stream 6,755 hours of the summer games in Rio on desktops, smartphones, tablets and connected TVs. The game has changed for TV sports broadcasting. Previously, the network that pays for the rights to broadcast the summer games would bolster ratings by airing only the most popular events for each country.This year, for the second time in history, NBC will broadcast and/or stream 6,755 hours of live coverage of the summer games across desktops, smartphones, tablets and connected TVs. Sports fans can see all the events in the summer games, not just the popular ones.It\u2019s not just a win for TV watchers. It\u2019s a win for networks, too.The move to digital has boosted viewership. Overall, the summer games in London attracted 4 billion global viewers over 17 days. In the U.S., there were 219.4 million TV viewers \u2014 the most ever.Along the way, some sports achieved newfound popularity. At one point, an average of 1.5 million people were watching archery competitions on cable during daytime hours. That was larger than the audience that tuned in to any other sport that was aired on cable at that time, including basketball.The viewership gains show the potential for technologies like TV Everywhere apps, including WatchESPN. Those apps are fast approaching mainstream use. This authenticated TV viewing encourages people to keep their cable subscriptions by allowing them to stream the TV they already pay for.TV Everywhere is rapidly changing viewership habits and the way people consume content, according to a report by Adobe. In fact, TV Everywhere viewership has more than doubled in the past year, up by 107 percent year over year, according to the report, which was compiled by Adobe Digital Insights, the research arm of Adobe.\u201cTechnology has the power to connect consumers to the sports they love, yet many media companies are challenged with providing people with a personalized and engaging viewing experience across screens,\u201d said Campbell Foster, Adobe\u2019s director of product marketing.

He's planning to watch the judo matches in Rio, too.\u201cI am guilty of creating a cult following at our business for Olympic judo,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the office in the break room, I would watch Olympic judo matches. Next thing I knew, they were hooked just like me.\u201dFans aren\u2019t the only ones taking notice of the newfound celebrity of athletes in up-and-coming events, such as weightlifting and trampoline. Marketers should be, too, experts say.Since many people will be watching from their mobile phones or tablets, with some simultaneously watching TV, marketing experts say it gives companies a big opportunity to do some creative marketing.To be sure, the trend toward viewing sports events across multiple screens makes it more complex for companies to find effective ways to reach customers. As a result, some companies will need to use multi-platform marketing strategies to target them.It\u2019s essential that marketers consider this because people aren\u2019t just watching on their set-top boxes anymore. In fact, the Adobe Digital Insights study found that 40 percent of U.S. consumers are watching sports on mobile devices.

And if the fans are any indication, sports like judo will continue to grow in popularity. Marketing experts say that companies are starting to find ways to take advantage of the 360-degree viewing of sports.For instance, during the 2012 summer games, a mobile-phone company created a campaign to help fans stay keyed-in through several technologies while watching the games. It created an app that gave fans updates on events, including schedules and winners. It also had a Facebook app that let fans see what others were saying about the games on social media. Additionally, a blogger at the company posted updates.Marketing experts say that smart marketers will think of interesting ways not only to take advantage of the more immersive sports-viewing experience, but also to target fans of newly popular sports.\u201cSo many companies want to have a dog in the race,\u201d said Carlos Scott, who owns a sports marketing and public relations firm that represents several gold-medal athletes. \u201cWith the advent of apps and technology, there are companies that could create some serious buzz, even with something like trampoline.\u201dJerry Solomon, a Boston-based sports agent who\u2019s represented big names in figure skating and tennis and now represents Harrison, said marketers can do more with top athletes in newly popular sports. He said those sports don\u2019t have the parameters that are sometimes in place in other sports, so companies can think of marketing ideas that have never been done before.\u201cIn a sport like judo, you sort of have a blank canvas you can work with to create things that are new and different,\u201d Solomon said. \u201cYou can be more creative.\u201d You sort of have a blank canvas you can work with to create things that are new and different.\u201d  A DIGITAL FUTURE FOR SPORTS As digital technology improves and viewers have access to more ways to watch sports, the rise in viewership of all sports \u2014 and newly popular sports, in particular \u2014 will likely continue.Digital will not only continue to drive viewership of the summer games.

It\u2019s also beneficial for the top athletes in sports that are gaining popularity because they are getting more recognition.The growing interest in judo has been good for Harrison, who overcame adversity as a teen to rise to the top of her sport. She now runs an organization that helps abused children and says that judo\u2019s greater visibility in the U.S. has meant a lot to her as well as to the sport.\u201cAs long as you have a good message and a good product \u2014 in this case, it\u2019s me and the sport \u2014 I think the opportunities will come, especially if you are getting more visibility,\u201d Harrison said.Source: Adobe Digital Insights Adobe is changing the world through digital experiences.  see how The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "Daily Report: Facebook Bars Cheesy Headlines That Let Readers Down", "Date": "2016-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsFacebook isn\u2019t ending spam. It just wants better labeling on the can.It\u2019s an interesting change, because Facebook is moving beyond ranking other outlets\u2019 stories based by how much traffic they\u2019re getting. Now, it cares whether that traffic was obtained somewhat deceptively.Two of the examples Facebook offered are telling. They were headlines that said \u201cThe Dog Barked at the Deliveryman and His Reaction Was Priceless,\u201d and \u201cWhen She Looked Under Her Couch Cushions and Saw THIS \u2026 I Was SHOCKED!\u201dYou know the kind of thing: The delivery guy\u2019s reaction will probably not be beyond price, and you\u2019ll probably recover pretty quick from whatever is under the couch cushions. But part of you may be (like me) a little bummed you didn\u2019t get to click on those titles to find out, even if (in my case) it does mean I\u2019ll probably hate myself a little bit for giving in. Again.And that feeling of letdown, and not the arguably inane content itself, is what Facebook is aiming at. A headline like \u201cDeliveryman Reacts to Barking Dog\u201d will probably face no penalty under Facebook\u2019s new rules, though the number of readers who come upon a story like that on the 1.7 billion-member network might be lucky to exceed 100. It\u2019s dull.Facebook doesn\u2019t really care what you read. It cares about how you feel while you are on Facebook. The content it links to is a part of its brand. It\u2019s a little like how you may change your view of a serious news story, or the site that publishes it, when you see that at the bottom there\u2019s a link to the unbelievable fate of 10 childhood TV stars. The link is part of the overall aura.Good news sites feel that they have to link to things like that, given the tough times in the media business. It\u2019s a mark of Facebook\u2019s power and scale that it can be more choosy. It\u2019s also an indication of how serious it is about keeping us all in Facebook as much as possible that it\u2019s taking steps like these.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Airbnb for Business Travelers: More Wi-Fi, Fewer Hosts in Towels", "Date": "2016-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byItinerariesWhether traveling for business or pleasure, Tad Milbourn, chief executive of the San Francisco technology start-up Payable, stays at an Airbnb property whenever possible.\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely the coolest, being in someone\u2019s house as opposed to a hotel,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s superior, from the price, experience and novelty standpoint.\u201dBecause Payable helps clients manage payments, Mr. Milbourn is particularly attuned to the services Airbnb has developed for business travelers, and he encourages his two employees who travel to use Airbnb and its services too. These include the ability to track employees\u2019 whereabouts and spending and to charge expenses to a corporate credit card.Mr. Milbourn is one of many business travelers now choosing Airbnb or other home-sharing services, like HomeAway and VRBO, over conventional hotels.A report issued last month by Concur, a travel and expense management company, found that the number of nights that its 42 million business travel customers spent in home-sharing accommodations rose more than 50 percent from the first quarter of 2015 to the first quarter of this year.Airbnb is actively cultivating this clientele, having recently reached agreements with three big business travel management companies in the United States: American Express Global Business Travel, BCD Travel and Carlson Wagonlit Travel.Under these agreements, Airbnb will send data on travelers\u2019 expenditures and itineraries to the travel management companies, which in turn will share the information with the travelers\u2019 employers, their clients. The employers can then use this data to monitor employees\u2019 spending and travel and to track them down, as needed, if there is an emergency.But some business travelers who have used Airbnb, especially those whose bosses booked the accommodations for them, warn that bad surprises can sometimes await.Alexa Pothier, a Boston-based consultant for a Palo Alto, Calif., software company, who has used Airbnb occasionally during vacations with generally positive results, had a different outcome on a business trip in 2014 when she stayed at a one-bedroom apartment in the Shoreditch neighborhood of London.The host owned a small business in a storefront on the ground floor, which Ms. Pothier had to walk through to reach the stairs to the apartment. Although the apartment had a large living space, where Ms. Pothier said she could work comfortably, she was startled by a mouse that \u201cearly on scampered very quickly across the couch.\u201dAnd the bedroom window overlooked a noisy street, which forced her to use earplugs that the host had left in a bowl next to the bed.When Katie Gilligan, a New Yorker and a former account manager for a London-based ticket-booking service, traveled to London last year on business, her boss put her up for a week each at two apartments booked through Airbnb.The second apartment, in the King\u2019s Cross neighborhood, was owned by a woman who shared the living space and would not let Ms. Gilligan use the water or flush the toilet after 8 p.m. The host also walked around wearing only a towel, Ms. Gilligan said, \u201ctalking to me about her life experience and about aliens coming down and probing people.\u201dAll the more reason, perhaps, to use Airbnb\u2019s business travel services that include \u201cbusiness travel ready\u201d listings \u2014 accommodations geared toward business travelers\u2019 specific needs.To qualify, a lodging must meet various criteria, including high customer ratings; 24-hour check-in; accommodations that are an entire home or apartment, not shared with the owner; the availability of Wi-Fi and a laptop-friendly work space; and an iron, a hair dryer and other amenities.Chip Conley, head of global hospitality and strategy for Airbnb, said that more than 70,000 companies had made bookings through Airbnb for Business, a program introduced last year that features listings and travel management tools.Not all of those companies, however, are as willing as Payable to talk about their use of Airbnb.Some of the prominent companies that Mr. Conley and others at Airbnb have cited as business travel customers \u2014 including Facebook and Google \u2014 declined to discuss the topic for this article. And many of the companies that were willing, including Morgan Stanley, Salesforce, Twilio and TBWA, had other business relationships with Airbnb.Some professionals in the business travel industry acknowledge the potential benefits of using services like Airbnb, and see some of the drawbacks.Airbnb\u2019s affordable offerings could help budget-conscious attendees of conventions and meetings, Deborah Sexton, president and chief executive of the Professional Convention Management Association, said in an email. Home-sharing accommodations can also offer an attractive alternative when hotel rooms are sold out, she said.Depending on its location, an Airbnb property might not be the most convenient option for a business traveler, particularly someone attending a conference or convention, Ms. Sexton said.\u201cOne of the biggest perks of a host hotel is its central location,\u201d she said. \u201cFor attendees who stay at Airbnb properties in different neighborhoods, getting to an early-morning conference or attending a late-night evening reception may be more difficult.\u201dMs. Sexton and some other experts also raised safety and legal concerns.Although Airbnb offers host protection insurance, which provides primary coverage for Airbnb hosts and landlords in more than 15 countries against liability claims of up to $1 million, the coverage does not apply to liability from assault and battery, sexual abuse or molestation, or to acts of terrorism, among other events.William A. Brewer III, a lawyer in New York and Dallas who represents hotel owners \u2014 typically some of Airbnb\u2019s staunchest opponents \u2014 said hotel owners, managers and franchisers had an obligation to reduce foreseeable risks. For the traveler, he said, the question is whether the providers of lodging have a balance sheet strong enough to pay for their negligence if trouble occurs.\u201cI believe this is why businesses often place their faith in well-known hotel chains when booking employee travel,\u201d he added.But those concerns might be offset, Mr. Brewer said, if a traveler were on a long-term assignment and the employer could cut costs significantly by booking an Airbnb property. In this case, he said, the employer could find it worthwhile to \u201cexpend the amount of effort required for due diligence to offset any liability issues.\u201dAirbnb has sued San Francisco over a June decision by the city\u2019s Board of Supervisors to fine the company $1,000 a day for every unregistered host on its service.That followed a bipartisan move by New York lawmakers, who voted to heavily fine anyone who used Airbnb to rent an entire apartment for fewer than 30 days \u2014 a practice that has been illegal in the state since 2010.Nick Papas, an Airbnb spokesman, said the company would not let those disputes deter its efforts to cultivate a business traveler clientele. \u201cThus far, we\u2019ve seen that business and leisure travelers remain eager to use Airbnb in New York and San Francisco,\u201d he said.Bjorn Hanson, a professor at the Tisch Center for Hospitality and Tourism at New York University, said the travel management companies\u2019 agreements with Airbnb showed that they were \u201ceffectively endorsing\u201d Airbnb.\u201cThis changes the debate\u201d that Airbnb is having with New York and San Francisco, he said, and gives \u201cmuch more weight to Airbnb\u2019s side.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chinese Tech Firms Forced to Choose Market: Home or Everywhere Else", "Date": "2016-08-09", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 For teenagers who like to sing along with Ariana Grande and Flo Rida, Musical.ly is a must-have. The app that lets users lip-sync and dance in their own music videos boasts 100 million users and partners with pop stars like Ms. Grande and Meghan Trainor.It\u2019s not easy to tell Musical.ly is Chinese \u2014 and that\u2019s deliberate. To find success in America, its parent company has ignored China, its home market and a country with 700 million internet users.The reason is simple, says Alex Zhu, co-founder of Shanghai-based Musical.ly: China\u2019s internet is fundamentally different from the one used in much of the rest of the world.\u201cIt\u2019s still very difficult to get into China,\u201d said Mr. Zhu, who studied civil engineering at Zhejiang University in the eastern city of Hangzhou. \u201cIt\u2019s a closed environment, and you have to be quite different to compete in that market.\u201dFor China\u2019s web companies, the divide may have even more significant implications.It has penned in the country\u2019s biggest and most innovative internet companies. Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent have grown to be some of the world\u2019s largest internet companies, but they rely almost entirely on domestic businesses. Their ventures abroad have been mostly desultory, and prognostications that they will challenge American giants internationally have not materialized.For Chinese web start-ups like Musical.ly, the internet split has also forced them to choose \u2014 either create something that caters to China\u2019s digital population or focus on the rest of the globe.In many ways, the split is like 19th century railroads in the United States, when rails of different sizes hindered a train\u2019s ability to go from one place to another.\u201cThe barrier to entering the U.S. or China market is becoming higher and higher,\u201d said Kai-fu Lee, a venture investor from Taiwan and former head of Google China.In 2012, armed with a cash stockpile of several hundred million dollars, the world soccer star Lionel Messi as a spokesman and local ads like Bollywood-inspired commercials in India, Tencent began a push that executives said would be its best chance of breaking out of China. The effort flopped.Critics pointed to Tencent\u2019s lack of distinctive marketing, a record of censorship and surveillance in China and its late arrival to foreign markets. Yet the biggest problem was that outside of China, WeChat was just not the same. Within China, WeChat can be used to do almost everything, like pay bills, hail a taxi, book a doctor\u2019s appointment, share photos and chat. Yet its ability to do that is dependent on other Chinese internet services that are limited outside the country.That leaves WeChat outside China as an app that people mostly use to chat and share photos \u2014 not that different from WhatsApp and Messenger, which are both owned by Facebook. Baidu and Alibaba have apps that similarly offer a range of capabilities, yet are less useful outside China.The same problem hurts start-ups in China. Those companies start out accustomed to using Chinese internet sites and apps to market and enhance their business. But going abroad means a different world of services to master, such as a solid understanding of Facebook and Google\u2019s platforms and ads, not Baidu\u2019s and Tencent\u2019s.By contrast, Musical.ly chose the opposite approach and linked itself to the most popular social networks in the United States. If someone records an impressively coordinated dance or flawlessly lip-synced song, the person can put it up not just on the app, but also add it to Instagram, send it on WhatsApp or post it to Facebook. That has helped Musical.ly grow naturally to Europe, South America and Southeast Asia, Mr. Zhu said.\u201cThe thing about this young generation in the U.S. is, they\u2019re creative,\u201d said Mr. Zhu. \u201cThey\u2019ll say, \u2018Please follow me on Instagram or Snapchat.\u2019 If your app can attract some people in an age group and make them super excited to share, you will probably grow.\u201dFor Cheetah Mobile, a maker of smartphone utility apps based in Beijing whose users are mostly outside China, the solution was finding a steppingstone to the rest of the world. In early 2014, it opened an office in Taiwan, where use of Google and Facebook dominates. That helped it gain employees who intimately understood Facebook, YouTube and other major Western platforms that could be used for advertising.\u201cTaiwan served as a bridge for us across the Pacific to the United States,\u201d said Charles Fan, Cheetah\u2019s chief technology officer.Tencent, Alibaba and Baidu have all opened American offices, but they have mostly turned to investments and acquisitions to gain footholds overseas. Over the last two years, Alibaba has invested in emerging markets, including two online commerce companies, Paytm and Snapdeal, in India. It also spent $1 billion to acquire Lazada, an e-commerce site popular in Southeast Asia.Perhaps the greatest indication of Tencent\u2019s overseas ambitions was a deal that never happened. In 2014, with its global WeChat campaign faltering, it was preparing to start negotiations to bid for WhatsApp when Facebook swooped in, according to a senior Tencent executive who asked for anonymity in discussing corporate strategy.Tencent and Baidu declined to comment. An Alibaba spokeswoman referred to recent remarks by Alibaba\u2019s president, J. Michael Evans, in which he pointed to acquisitions as a way the company was attracting new consumers in developing markets. He also said Alibaba was focused on attracting more foreign businesses to sell on its markets in China.Mr. Lee said it might take a new technological jump for Chinese companies to get a chance at building a platform inside China and internationally. He said Chinese companies could prove competitive in emerging sectors like virtual reality, artificial intelligence and robotics.\u201cI think what might be surprising is, China will catch up rapidly,\u201d he said. \u201cPartly because of Chinese universities, partly because of returnees to China who form a portion of the top engineers in the world.\u201dMusical.ly is in many ways a product of the cultural exchange between the United States and China that Mr. Lee described. Mr. Zhu, 37, graduated from a Chinese university, but moved to the United States with the German software company SAP in 2010. He had the idea for the music app while riding the train from San Francisco to Mountain View, Calif., in a car full of high school students.\u201cHalf were listening to music and the other half were using their phone to take photos and add emojis, and they were passing them around,\u201d Mr. Zhu said. Then it hit him: combine the selfie and social media part with the music part and turn it into one product. In 2015, Mr. Zhu moved to Shanghai, where his co-founder has been based since Musical.ly\u2019s 2013 inception.Yet Musical.ly is unlikely to be the social network to link both sides of the Pacific. For the demographic the app is focusing on, it\u2019s far better to be outside its home market, Mr. Zhu said.\u201cTeenagers in the U.S. are a golden audience,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at China, the teenage culture doesn\u2019t exist \u2014 the teens are super busy in school studying for tests, so they don\u2019t have the time and luxury to play social media apps.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Thousands Displaced in Storm-Drenched Louisiana", "Date": "2016-08-14", "News": "Supported byAfter days of ruinously heavy storms in southern Louisiana, rain-swollen rivers and creeks continued wreaking damage across the state, inundating neighborhoods and submerging roads and highways.More than 20,000 people have had to be rescued from the flooding this weekend, Louisiana officials said, in a waterlogged stretch from the parishes to the north and east of Baton Rouge west past the city of Lafayette. Thousands of homes have been flooded, forcing more than 10,000 people into shelters. Those stranded by the waters found themselves further marooned by a massive cellular network failure.Parts of major roadways became islands, including a stretch of interstate where hundreds of drivers had been stranded for over 24 hours, officials said. The governor\u2019s office said that all the motorists had been rescued by Sunday evening.On Sunday evening, President Barack Obama spoke with the Governor John Bel Edwards, to say his request for an emergency declaration had been granted for the state\u2019s flood response and recovery efforts, a spokeswoman for the administration said.While the drenching thunderstorms that led to the flooding have lessened in intensity and largely moved from the areas most severely affected, the disaster is hardly over. As the swollen rivers roll south and fill tributaries and backwaters, new places are expected to flood, highlighting the most difficult part of this event: that past experience has served as such a poor guide.\u201cThe simple fact of the matter here is we\u2019re breaking records,\u201d Mr. Edwards said to reporters on Sunday. \u201cAnd any time you break a record, the National Weather Service cannot tell you what you can expect in the way of the floodwaters: how wide they\u2019re going to be and how deep they\u2019re going to be.\u201dEven in a part of the country long used to living with high waters, this was, as Mr. Edwards said, a \u201chistoric, unprecedented flooding event.\u201d Previous knowledge about which areas tend to go underwater and which stay dry was rendered useless.\u201cWhat was going on last night especially around two and three o\u2019clock in the morning sounded exactly like Katrina,\u201d said Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor\u2019s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, talking of the chatter of emergency medical workers over the radio. \u201cIt got so bad that, as they were moving in buses and other vehicles to move people, there was concern about getting the people on board in time because the flooding was coming so fast.\u201dMr. Steele went through the damage estimates by parish \u2014 1,000 homes in East Baton Rouge, 1,000 homes in Livingston, 500 in Tangipahoa and so on \u2014 but stressed that any tally was already out of date. \u201cGuaranteed that number\u2019s higher today than it was last night,\u201d he said.The flooding in many places was worse than a seemingly exceptional statewide inundation a few months ago, and some of the state\u2019s rivers were cresting at several feet above record levels set in a devastating flood event in 1983.Like many others in southern Louisiana, the hundreds who were forced to stay overnight in their cars on a stretch of Interstate 12 were surrounded by a dangerously confounding new topography. Deep pockets of water were broken up by areas of dry land, which gave way again to deep pockets of water.\u201cYou can get on a boat and you can get a little bit closer, but at some point, you run out of water and there\u2019s land again,\u201d said Trooper Bryan Lee of the Louisiana State Police. \u201cSo many places are cut off we can\u2019t get resources to them.\u201dMore than 1,700 National Guardsmen were involved in response and rescue efforts as of Sunday morning, with 2,000 expected to join the work.Areas around Baton Rouge saw some of the worst flooding, making a summer that had already been trying that much more difficult. But the emphasis on Sunday, made by the governor and others, was on the cooperation that has sprung up amid the disaster at hand.\u201cThis is my giving back,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd thank y\u2019all for helping me.\u201dGardiner Harris contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Flooding Compounds Pain of Tragic Summer in Baton Rouge", "Date": "2016-08-17", "News": "Supported byBATON ROUGE, La. \u2014 Few can appreciate the scale of devastation and loss here quite like the tow truck driver.Since before dawn, Terrance Carter was up, first getting a flooded Cadillac out of Zachary, a town where more than two feet of rain had fallen in 72 hours. Soon after, he was hooking up a pickup truck abandoned by its driver during the floods in a neighborhood of North Baton Rouge, where nearly every house had the telltale brown stain up past the windowsills. Two hours later, he was taking a minivan through the charmingly named and thoroughly devastated middle-class subdivisions in the eastern part of the city.\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to pass by that store,\u201d said Mr. Carter, a 28-year-old father of four who like thousands here is now homeless. He drove on in silence for some blocks. Then he pointed: \u201cAll this flooded.\u201dBy Wednesday morning, about 7,000 people were spread among 37 shelters across flood-ravaged southern Louisiana, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said. Later in the day, the death toll reached 13, and state officials said they were still searching homes and businesses after a flood that the American Red Cross described as \u201cthe worst natural disaster to strike the United States since Superstorm Sandy.\u201dIn Ascension Parish, southeast of Baton Rouge, the local emergency preparedness director compared rescue operations to those that followed Hurricane Katrina in 2005. \u201cThe sheltering effort is actually greater than what we saw for Hurricane Katrina,\u201d the director, Richard A. Webre, said.The White House said that President Obama, who was vacationing in Massachusetts, had received a briefing on Wednesday morning from the FEMA administrator, W. Craig Fugate, who visited Louisiana this week. More than 70,000 people had registered for federal assistance, the White House said.Nearly everyone here has been affected by one of the crises this summer, some by two and some by all three. Police officers in Baton Rouge have been working extended shifts of 12 hours each, even though, according to a department spokesman, the flooding affected \u201ca large number\u201d of officers.\u201cWe\u2019re out there and we\u2019re doing what we can,\u201d said Sgt. Don Coppola Jr. of the Baton Rouge Police Department.In Livingston Parish, the Sheriff\u2019s Office said that at least 60 deputies had had to deal with flood damage. \u201cSome have nowhere to go,\u201d the agency said on its Facebook page.The homes of the families of the three law enforcement officers killed on July 17 \u2014 Cpl. Montrell L. Jackson and Officer Matthew Gerald of the Baton Rouge police, and Deputy Brad Garafola of the East Baton Rouge Sheriff\u2019s Office \u2014 had made it through the floods, officials said, some damaged but none ruined.Mr. Carter had been asleep early on July 5 when his mother called and told him that her brother, Mr. Sterling, had been shot by an officer at the Triple S. The days unfolded and exploded. Mr. Carter\u2019s employer saw him on television talking about the shooting and fired him, Mr. Carter said. A baby daughter was born a week later. Three days after that, Mr. Carter stood before hundreds at his uncle\u2019s funeral service and recited a poem he had written, \u201cKiss From Your Nephew.\u201dTwo days afterward, the three officers were shot dead by a man from Missouri angered about Mr. Sterling\u2019s death. Mr. Carter emphasized to the reporters who asked: He did not condone violence at all; he has relatives on the police force.The summer quieted until the rains came this past weekend. He had to spend Saturday and Sunday nights in a shelter in Baton Rouge with his four young children, from 5 weeks to 7 years, and Bessia Moore, the mother of the two youngest.On Monday, he moved everyone to his sisters\u2019 small house, joining nine other people and two dogs. On Tuesday, he went to the house where he, his children, his mother and stepfather had been living, and found it and everything in it ruined. On Wednesday, he was back at work.\u201cSomebody gave me the clothes I have on now,\u201d he said Wednesday, sitting in the truck cab equipped with a pack of cigarettes and the last of his insulin shots. \u201cNothing I have on is mine. Even the shoes.\u201dThis part of his story is not so different from many others in south Louisiana. It has similarities with Michelle Monistere, who had the minivan in Lakeview Estates, which like so many subdivisions in the eastern part of the city was congested with piles of ruined mattresses, carpeting, wallboard and furniture.It is familiar to Tasha Butler, who was taking everything out of the house where she had lived for 35 out of the last 40 years.\u201cIt was bad,\u201d she said through a dust mask. \u201cIt\u2019s everything.\u201dMr. Carter was in North Baton Rouge, a struggling and often overlooked part of the city where he has lived most of his life, to retrieve the pickup.Discarded cars littered the streets. Mr. Carter recognized Ms. Butler\u2019s house, having helped paint it when he was 10.\u201cIn time, it will be better,\u201d said Ms. Butler, throwing another garbage bag on the enormous pile on her lawn.After hours on the road, Mr. Carter finally stopped for something to eat: fried shrimp and fish at the V & P Seafood and Deli. A local news channel was playing, and the police chief of a small flooded Louisiana city was talking of the coffins that had floated up from graveyards.\u201cEven the dead can\u2019t rest,\u201d the chief was saying.Mr. Carter watched. He had feared this possibility when he was in the shelter over the weekend, he said. So he had walked from the shelter to his uncle\u2019s grave. It had not been disturbed.Campbell Robertson reported from Baton Rouge, and Alan Blinder from Atlanta.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Court Overturns \u2018Burkini\u2019 Ban in French Town", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn its ruling, the court, known as the Council of State, found that the ban in the town of Villeneuve-Loubet violated civil liberties, including freedom of movement and religious freedom, and that officials had failed to show that the swimwear posed a threat to public order.The ruling also made clear that the bans in other municipalities could be similarly overturned, and the Socialist government seemed conflicted on how to respond.In a statement, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve suggested that it was time for the local officials to back down, saying it was now \u201cup to each and every one to responsibly seek to ease tensions, which is the only way to avoid disturbances to public order and to bolster coexistence.\u201dMr. Valls, who last week likened the burkini to a form of \u201censlavement,\u201d said in his comments on Friday that \u201ccondemning the burkini in no way questions individual liberties.\u201dThe court\u2019s decision seemed unlikely to end the controversy as France enters a presidential election season. The center-right former president, Nicolas Sarkozy, who has announced his plans to run for president again, supports a national ban.While the decision does not apply directly to the many other French cities and towns that have banned the burkini, it amounts to a warning that their prohibitions are likely to be overturned if challenged. The largest such community is the city of Nice.The United Nations and the White House seemed relieved by the ruling.\u201cObviously we welcome the decision by the court,\u201d Secretary General Ban Ki-moon\u2019s chief spokesman, St\u00e9phane Dujarric, who had expressed concern about the burkini ban, said at a news briefing, emphasizing \u201cthe need for people\u2019s personal dignity to be respected.\u201dJosh Earnest, a White House spokesman, said the United States did not want to \u201csecond-guess\u201d France, but noted that President Obama \u201cbelieves strongly in the freedom of religion.\u201d\u201cThe council has ruled and has showed that mayors do not have the right to set limits on wearing religious signs in public spaces,\u201d he said, in the absence of a demonstrated threat to public order. \u201cIt is contrary to the freedom of religion, which is a fundamental freedom.\u201dVilleneuve-Loubet, a seaside resort of about 14,000, adopted the ban on Aug. 5, and it was supposed to end on Sept. 15. Police officers in the town will no longer be able to issue fines for burkini-wearing, and women who received fines will be able to contest them.\u201cNormally, mayors should remove their ordinances following this decision, except if they want to race against the clock and go to court,\u201d Mr. Muhammad said, noting that the ordinances are set to expire in the coming weeks, while the court process can drag on for longer. Several mayors have already told French media that they did not intend to remove their bans in light of the ruling.The ordinances in question did not mention Islam or the burkinis explicitly \u2014 instead banned bathing attire that was not \u201cappropriate,\u201d was not \u201crespectful of good morals and of secularism,\u201d or did not respect \u201chygiene and security rules\u201d \u2014 but the target of the laws was obvious.The Council of State said the \u201cemotions and concerns that are the result of the terrorist attacks, most notably the one carried out in Nice last July 14, do not suffice to legally justify the ban.\u201dRestrictions on liberty \u201cmust be justified by proven risks to public order,\u201d the court said, finding that the town\u2019s mayor had failed to meet that criterion.Anti-discrimination and human rights groups had challenged the restrictions in local courts, but the rules were upheld, leading the groups to appeal to the Council of State, which heard arguments from lawyers for both sides on Thursday.The bans have also fueled an intense political debate and split the French government, with Mr. Valls expressing support for them and several female ministers opposing the restrictions, even as they voiced distaste for the garments.Marine Le Pen, the head of the far-right National Front, said after the ruling that French lawmakers should expand a 2004 law that bans ostentatious religious symbols in schools to all public places, except for \u201creligious personnel,\u201d but she did not make clear how broad that exception should be.The showdown over the burkini was only the latest controversy over the principle of la\u00efcit\u00e9, or secularism, that has been a defining feature of French political life since the Revolution. Critics say the principle is increasingly used to justify measures that single out Muslims, rather than keeping government out of religion and vice versa, the original intent.Although the ruling on Friday technically suspended the ban, Mr. Cassia said the decision effectively overturned the prohibition completely and showed that the principle of la\u00efcit\u00e9 had been misapplied by the towns.\u201cIt means neutrality for the state, not the individual,\u201d Mr. Cassia said.He added: \u201cI was in Nice two days ago. There are women in the street with veils. It\u2019s completely unreasonable to ban them from the beach, while they are free to walk around the city. It\u2019s hysteria.\u201dMr. Muhammad, the head of the Collective Against Islamophobia in France, said he feared that in the current political climate, Muslims would continue to be targeted.A video with an earlier version of this article misrepresented the events on two public beaches in France. The woman shown in the beginning of the video was in Nice and the woman interviewed, Siam, was in Cannes. Neither was forced to remove her head scarf. The video has been removed.Martin de Bourmont contributed reporting from Paris, and Rick Gladstone from New York.Advertisement"}

He is little known outside pockets of the art world, yet he has been grinding away for nearly 50 years. Fortunately, his efforts will receive wider recognition this fall, as the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art is presenting a massive retrospective of his work, which opens Sept. 24, and publishing a monograph to accompany the show.Both projects were the brainchild of  Erin O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Toole, a curator with the museum and a fellow Angeleno, who became smitten with Mr. Hernandez\u00e2\u0080\u0099s photographs while conducting research in 2010.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe more I dug, the more he seemed really interesting to me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt one point, I mentioned to my then-boss Sandy [Sandra Phillips] that I was interested in his work. Had he ever had a big show? She had been supporting him for a long time. She bought work over the years and really loved it. She was really excited that I was interested, and encouraged me to propose a retrospective.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMs. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Toole was drawn to the stark, bleak depictions of her home city, which were so different from the glamorized visions presented in art and popular culture.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe first time I saw those pictures, they bowled me over,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey were the only ones I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen that captured that sense of Los Angeles, to me. The unidealized Los Angeles. The real L.A. that I knew. That incredible quality of light. And this wide-openness of the long boulevards. The combination of physical beauty and the sort of ruin that you see in L.A.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Hernandez, who now splits his time between Los Angeles and Idaho, has been photographing those streets since he was a youth, having picked up photography after a high school friend randomly gave him a camera manual. He says his approach is simply an extension of a lifetime as an observer, beginning on the streets of Boyle Heights, the neighborhood in which he grew up near downtown.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI loved to walk, versus taking the streetcar or bus home,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat walking was always taking different routes home. Exploring the alleys. Just looking, you might say. In that sense, that started when I was a lot younger, before I got that book.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDuring a trip he took to New York in 1970, his black-and-white street photographs drew him into the orbit of some of the most famous American photographers, as John Szarkowski, the famed curator at the Museum of Modern Art, introduced him to Diane Arbus and Garry Winogrand. They encouraged him to continue with his work, as he had no real formal training. And back then, unlike today, there were no hordes of photographers on every corner, snapping shutters or pushing icons on cellphones.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe only photographer that I always used to run into when I was starting off in the \u00e2\u0080\u009970s and early \u00e2\u0080\u009980s was Garry Winogrand, who I knew in New York,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Hernandez said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d bump into him whether it was in Venice, or downtown L.A. Beverly Hills. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d always get together after for coffee.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThough Winogrand frequented those locales, Mr. Hernandez was more wide-ranging, walking through places like South Central, Compton and Watts. His style continued to evolve, as he changed cameras and formats over time. Through it all, however, working-class Los Angeles has remained his muse, partly, he said, because he has always made it a point to leave the city. (He even did a stint as a medic during the Vietnam War.)Ms. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Toole says this willingness to take risks, and to constantly push himself, distinguishes Mr. Hernandez from many of his contemporaries.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe would also leave formats or subjects behind that were successful,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u201cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very brave as an artist to do that.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe show arrives as San Francisco is undergoing a homelessness crisis, so it seems a perfect time to display photographs that take such an empathetic, original view of what life is like on the streets. Mr. Hernandez first explored the issue in the late \u00e2\u0080\u009980s, with \u00e2\u0080\u009cLandscapes for the Homeless,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a series that features the tragic, unwelcoming spaces that homeless people inhabit.He returned to the subject in his recent project \u00e2\u0080\u009cForever,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which he named in honor of a friend, the photographer Lewis Baltz, who died in 2014. In these images, Mr. Hernandez finds and locates places where homeless people sleep, lies down in their stead and makes photographs of the views from the makeshift beds.Ms. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Toole, while admitting she had not planned to create dialogue around homelessness back in 2010, is nevertheless glad the exhibition will inject the issue into public discourse.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s devastating. I think about it every day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think about how can we, in one of most expensive cities in the world, be O.K. with the fact there are all these people falling through cracks and having to live on the streets. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s completely inexcusable. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my personal feeling.\u00e2\u0080\u009dOther series also tackle economic and social inequality, dating to 1970, when Mr. Hernandez offered a sardonic take on Edward Weston\u00e2\u0080\u0099s classic photo of his wife, Charis Wilson, nude in the sand. (He photographed street people on the beach instead.) More recently, his project \u00e2\u0080\u009cDiscarded\u00e2\u0080\u009d illuminated the devastation wrought by the housing crisis and Great Recession on less-enticing, inland parts of California.Through it all, Mr. Hernandez has continued to work. While he contends that having influential friends and supporters is crucial to every artist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s success, he was clear that his goals have always been to grow, and make the best pictures he can. While he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s certainly excited to be celebrated with a big exhibition in a white-hot city, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not what has motivated him all these years.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say something has to drive you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he concluded. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhatever that is, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to have to, no matter what, just keep doing it. Because if you stop, then it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all over. You just have to keep going. That worked for me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}
{"Headline": "With N.F.L. Deal, Twitter Live-Streams Its Ambitions", "Date": "2016-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Last March, Twitter and Facebook, along with other tech companies, faced off over which of them would get the rights to live-stream National Football League games on Thursday nights.Twitter, in contrast, agreed to pay the N.F.L. around $10 million to stream 10 games and to sell only a portion of the ad inventory exclusively. Twitter, which is based in San Francisco, wanted the Thursday night games because of their popularity; each game drew an average of 13 million viewers last season.When Twitter streams its first N.F.L. game on Sept. 15, it will get to assess whether its vigorous pursuit will pay off \u2014 and whether live streaming can viably be a linchpin of its future.Since April, Twitter has signed a series of live-streaming deals, including with Wimbledon, CBS News, the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League and Pac-12 Networks. Twitter is also in discussions with other organizations, including Major League Soccer and the Professional Golfers Association, for similar agreements, according to people briefed on the talks.Facebook declined to comment on the N.F.L. talks. In a statement at the time, the N.F.L. commissioner, Roger Goodell, said Twitter \u201cis where live events unfold and is the right partner.\u201d Major League Soccer declined to comment on discussions with Twitter, and the P.G.A. did not respond to requests for comment.For Twitter, the bet on live streaming is crucial to turning itself into a mainstream internet destination after other efforts have failed. Live streaming could finally broaden Twitter\u2019s appeal, attracting an even wider audience. And perhaps more important, live events would be another way to sell video ads. If streaming football or basketball games on Twitter\u2019s mobile apps and on desktop computers, along with other platforms, draws viewers, the company could sell more video ads, which typically command a premium.Twitter has directed Mr. Noto, a former Goldman Sachs banker with deep ties to the sports media industry, to lead the charge on live streaming and has assigned an engineering team to create its streaming video player. Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, considers streaming a critical component of the company\u2019s focus on \u201clive\u201d experiences, along with Periscope, its app that allows smartphone users to live-stream video.To bolster the effort, Twitter is in talks with Apple to bring the Twitter app to Apple TV, which would potentially let millions of Apple TV users watch the streaming N.F.L. games, according to the two people briefed on the discussions.Apple and Twitter declined to comment.Yet even as Twitter increases its live-streaming efforts, so are many of its rivals. Snapchat and Facebook are working on deals with media companies to acquire live-streaming rights to sporting events and entertainment; Instagram is also experimenting with live products. All of the companies are fiercely competing for video advertising dollars, as marketers slowly begin to shift money to online video promotions and away from television ads.There are other hurdles to live streaming, especially from wary content providers who view the technology world with a dose of suspicion.Twitter\u2019s push on live streaming began in late 2014 when Dick Costolo, then the company\u2019s chief executive, called Mr. Noto to discuss how to better use content \u2014 video, text or photos \u2014 to bring people to its service. Over the next 18 months, senior executives at the company debated options. Some batted around the idea of buying Mic, a news website aimed at young audiences, according to a person briefed on the conversations. Others were bullish on video.Eventually, video won out. Mr. Noto said that introducing premium content like sports, politics and entertainment \u2014 the types of programming people often pay to see \u2014 would entice and retain more Twitter users.Even with competition from Snapchat and Facebook, Twitter has a foundation to attract more live-streaming deals. For years, Twitter forged relationships with networks and content owners through a program known as Amplify, in which Twitter worked with TV programmers to distribute short video clips that were preceded by ads sold by both Twitter and the content owners.Twitter is also emphasizing its younger audience as a reason for marketers to advertise on live events. About 72 percent of the social media service\u2019s user base is 18 to 34 years old, according to third-party data and company models, said two people who asked for anonymity because Twitter\u2019s internal metrics were confidential.That focus has in part enabled Twitter to land advertisers like Bank of America for the streaming N.F.L. games.\u201cTwitter really owns those moments that matter to everyone,\u201d said Lou Paskalis, senior vice president for enterprise media planning at Bank of America. \u201cAs a marketer, what we can do with the context that Twitter creates is to join that shared moment.\u201dMr. Noto cautioned that Twitter\u2019s live-streaming strategy was still not fully formed and was just one part of a multipronged plan to remake the company. If live streaming works out, the plan is to make the live videos more easily accessible on Twitter \u2014 whether through notifications in the main timeline or through a mobile tab in Twitter\u2019s app called Moments, said two people briefed on the company\u2019s product plans.But first comes the N.F.L. game next month between the New York Jets and the Buffalo Bills, which will be live-streamed from Buffalo.\u201cOur opportunity is to use these familiar platforms that people understand, like streaming video, as a window into seeing everything else we really have available,\u201d Mr. Noto said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Daily Report: Facebook Bars Cheesy Headlines That Let Readers Down", "Date": "2016-08-05", "News": "Supported byBitsFacebook isn\u2019t ending spam. It just wants better labeling on the can.It\u2019s an interesting change, because Facebook is moving beyond ranking other outlets\u2019 stories based by how much traffic they\u2019re getting. Now, it cares whether that traffic was obtained somewhat deceptively.Two of the examples Facebook offered are telling. They were headlines that said \u201cThe Dog Barked at the Deliveryman and His Reaction Was Priceless,\u201d and \u201cWhen She Looked Under Her Couch Cushions and Saw THIS \u2026 I Was SHOCKED!\u201dYou know the kind of thing: The delivery guy\u2019s reaction will probably not be beyond price, and you\u2019ll probably recover pretty quick from whatever is under the couch cushions. But part of you may be (like me) a little bummed you didn\u2019t get to click on those titles to find out, even if (in my case) it does mean I\u2019ll probably hate myself a little bit for giving in. Again.And that feeling of letdown, and not the arguably inane content itself, is what Facebook is aiming at. A headline like \u201cDeliveryman Reacts to Barking Dog\u201d will probably face no penalty under Facebook\u2019s new rules, though the number of readers who come upon a story like that on the 1.7 billion-member network might be lucky to exceed 100. It\u2019s dull.Facebook doesn\u2019t really care what you read. It cares about how you feel while you are on Facebook. The content it links to is a part of its brand. It\u2019s a little like how you may change your view of a serious news story, or the site that publishes it, when you see that at the bottom there\u2019s a link to the unbelievable fate of 10 childhood TV stars. The link is part of the overall aura.Good news sites feel that they have to link to things like that, given the tough times in the media business. It\u2019s a mark of Facebook\u2019s power and scale that it can be more choosy. It\u2019s also an indication of how serious it is about keeping us all in Facebook as much as possible that it\u2019s taking steps like these.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Giants Gobble Start-Ups in an Antitrust Blind Spot", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDeal ProfessorLike Facebook\u2019s acquisition of WhatsApp, the Walmart deal will probably end up being another example of an upstart internet company being swallowed up to preserve the stranglehold of a giant.This happens because antitrust regulators are stuck in an outdated view of the world, while the internet giants are more attuned to their nascent competitive threats. The deal for Jet.com is just the latest defensive internet acquisition of an emerging start-up that will preserve the hegemony of a select few.And now it is being swallowed up by Walmart.This could be seen as a victory for competition. Walmart will now have a more dynamic management and brand to buttress its own internet sales operation, which trails Amazon by quite a distance. This will allow it to better compete against Amazon. The likely result is that competition in online retailing will eventually be a slugfest between Amazon and Walmart with everyone else thrown by the wayside.The problem with this narrative is that it cements the positions of Walmart and Amazon as the only players in town.This is the modus operandi of the big internet behemoths. They live in fear of new technology disrupting their businesses and killing them off.Mr. Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez was a Facebook product manager when the company faced its greatest threat: Google Plus. Facebook won because it enforced an ethos of all work, all the time, spurred by constant fear of extinction.Facebook and its elite brethren will do anything to make sure they are not the next Yahoo or Radio Shack, killed by disruption and failure to innovate. This translates into paying obscene sums for technology that might challenge their dominance one day.If you don\u2019t believe this, there is a poignant passage in \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d where Mr. Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez notes that Mark Zuckerberg saw that there were two companies with \u201chockey stick growth\u201d that matched Facebook\u2019s own: Instagram and WhatsApp. Both were amassing users at an amazing rate and both were an existential threat to Facebook.Did Mr. Zuckerberg rev up the Facebook machine to try to outcompete them? No. Instead, he bought Instagram for about $1 billion and WhatsApp for an astounding $21.8 billion.Today, Facebook is dominant, with more than 1.7 billion monthly active users. WhatsApp has more than 1 billion monthly active users and Instagram, more than 500 million.Another Google example is YouTube, which was bought for $1.65 billion in 2006 and is now a constant stream of users for Google. Indeed, YouTube, with more than one billion active monthly users, is a top driver of Alphabet\u2019s user growth.Billions of dollars are made in Silicon Valley by selling nascent upstarts to the giants. And the dominant players pay eagerly to remain dominant. That is what is going on with the Jet.com acquisition and perhaps even the $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn by Microsoft.Where are the antitrust authorities in all of this? The guiding standard under the law is that no acquisition should be allowed if it would \u201clessen competition.\u201dUnder the traditional view of antitrust, when Facebook, for example, tries to buy a company like Instagram, it can argue that anyone can start such a website. And there are other competitors like Google and Snapchat. And so this gets past the antitrust authorities, who seem more concerned with how the data will be used rather than the accumulation of users. Both United States and European Union regulators examined the WhatsApp deal, but it passed muster because WhatsApp was viewed as a messenger service, something where there was alternative competition.This misses the point that domination is all about users and views. Those companies with users and page views can dominate, and accumulating those users is everything, something only an infinitesimally small number of companies can find the key to doing.The antitrust system results in the increasing oligopoly that we have, where a few companies dominate major industries, accruing the wealth and power that go with it as potential disrupters are swallowed at birth, the way Cronus, the titan in Greek mythology, ate his young to prevent their uprising.No one knows what might happen to Jet if it remained independent. Perhaps it would fail. Amazon is dominant and Walmart may truly be the only real competitor. The same could be said of any of these acquisitions of high-growth companies. So preventing this acquisition may result not in creating a competitor to Amazon but in the eventual death of Jet. This of course would leave its founder and investors much poorer, a true cost.The flip side of this risk is that the big tech companies continue unchallenged in their dominance. Perhaps it is time to rethink antitrust enforcement, and take the risks associated with a different view of antitrust that looks at potential dominance and at breaking up oligopolies. Rhea protected Zeus from Cronus, which eventually led to Cronus\u2019s destruction.If antitrust authorities do not adapt and emerging competitors continue to be bought up, we should not be surprised of the continued dominance of a very few companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Walmart.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Irredeemable Twin", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "Supported byIt\u2019s rich, as the English would say, that Donald Trump is trying to profit from Anthony Weiner\u2019s latest mortification, because Trump is to his persevering supporters what Weiner was to his long-suffering wife: a scoundrel undeserving of so many second chances; a head case incapable of the redemption that\u2019s supposedly just a few extra measures of discipline away; someone selling himself as a servant of the public although he\u2019s really a slave to his own raging ego and unquenchable needs.When Trump looks in the mirror, there\u2019s a whole lot of Weiner staring back at him.The details are tawdrier in Weiner\u2019s case, and the stakes far smaller. But both men are creatures of potent want and pure compulsion who lucked into forgiving audiences. Weiner\u2019s finally stopped forgiving: Huma Abedin announced that she was formally separating from him after six years of marriage.Trump still has legions by his side. But for how long?The left side of the chart presented a timeline of his apostasies and indecencies, and it alone was transfixing: a reminder that any other candidate at any other time would have been undone by just one or two of these outrages; an illustration of the way they keep coming, no matter how ardently his inner circle pleads with him for calm, no matter how furiously the outside world reacts. He can\u2019t help himself.The right side of the chart presented another timeline, this one showing the points at which each of the 110 Republicans bolted. The surprise was how delayed their departures were. Hope is a stubborn thing.And at some point, it\u2019s too rosy a word for what\u2019s really going on, which is denial, delusion.There\u2019s also brutal calculation: Does Trump\u2019s function as a barrier against a Democratic president \u2014 against Hillary Clinton, in particular \u2014 outweigh his cruelty, his incivility, his bigotry, his utter fraudulence? Too many Republicans have convinced themselves of that, in part by minimizing those vices, seeing them as ephemeral, or simply averting their gazes.Some of these Republicans are living in the same fairy tale that some spouses are. They\u2019re telling themselves the same lie: that fidelity matters more than dignity and common sense. But if a crucial part of wisdom is knowing when to invest, an equally crucial part is knowing when to let go.The Weiner-Abedin marriage had apparently devolved, even before the latest revelation of fresh sexting, into a blunt child care arrangement, with Mr. Weiner\u2019s attentions to their 4-year-old son making her heavy travel schedule with Clinton possible.If Trump wants to make Abedin an issue, he\u2019s on fairer, sturdier ground with the extra pay from outside sources that Clinton arranged for her when they worked together at the State Department.He\u2019s on dangerous turf when he goes after Weiner as a \u201csicko\u201d and a \u201cpervert.\u201d He\u2019s no paragon of rectitude, no pillar of restraint.This is someone who once joked to Howard Stern \u2014 on the air \u2014 that his own Vietnam was the danger he courted as a libidinous man in an era of sexually transmitted diseases. This is someone who publicly drooled over his daughter Ivanka, saying that he might date her if he hadn\u2019t sired her.Weiner sent strangers pictures of his bulge. Trump assured the viewers of a nationally televised debate that he was amply endowed.These impulses \u2014 these boasts \u2014 aren\u2019t unrelated.A scene in the documentary \u201cWeiner,\u201d about his ill-fated run for New York City mayor, depicts him at a computer, raptly watching and reliving one of his appearances on MSNBC. Trump is famous for marinating in all of the television time devoted to him. He tallies it. He crows about it. He\u2019s Weiner with extra traction, Weiner with added gilt.It forces an important question: Have we constructed a politics with such bright, invasive lights that those who find it more attractive than repulsive include an unhealthy number of insecure exhibitionists out for affirmation above all else?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Diet: He\u2019ll Have Fries With That", "Date": "2016-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGeorge W. Bush was an exercise buff, obsessed with staying trim by mountain biking and clearing brush at his ranch in Crawford, Tex.But Donald J. Trump is taking a different approach: A junk food aficionado, he is hoping to become the nation\u2019s fast food president.Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign is improvised, undisciplined, rushed and self-indulgent.And so is his diet.In an era of gourmet dining and obsession with healthy ingredients, Mr. Trump is a throwback to an earlier, more carefree time in American eating, when nobody bothered to ask whether the tomatoes were locally grown, and the first lady certainly didn\u2019t have a vegetable garden, complete with a bee hive, on the South Lawn of the White House.But his highbrow, lowbrow image \u2014 of the jet-setting mogul who takes buckets of fried chicken onto his private plane with the gold-plated seatbelt buckles \u2014 is also a carefully crafted one.If President George Bush revealed his patrician upbringing by requesting \u201ca splash\u201d more coffee at a truck stop in New Hampshire, and John Kerry helped reinforce his image as a New England blue blood by trying to order a cheese steak with Swiss in South Philadelphia, Mr. Trump\u2019s diet also telegraphs to his blue-collar base that he is one of them.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more American and more of-the-people than fast food,\u201d said Russ Schriefer, a Republican strategist and ad maker. \u201cIt is the peculiarity of the brand that he\u2019s able to be on his multimillion-dollar jet with the gold and black branding and colors, and at the same time eat KFC \u2014 and what makes it perfect is he does it all with a knife and fork, while reading The Wall Street Journal.\u201dOr, as Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser and pollster on the Trump campaign, put it, \u201cIt goes with his authenticity.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think Hillary Clinton would be eating Popeye\u2019s biscuits and fried chicken,\u201d she said.Still, Mr. Trump seems to come by his appetite for fast food genuinely.While junk food has long been a staple of campaign trail life \u2014 Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 press corps coined the term \u201cslunch\u201d to refer to the unhealthy phenomenon of the \u201csecond lunch\u201d \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s reliance on high-calorie fare is driven more by a combination of speed, efficiency and, above all else, cleanliness.Mr. Trump has even suggested doing away with state dinners, in a fit of cost and time savings. \u201cWe should be eating a hamburger on a conference table, and we should make better deals with China and others and forget the state dinners,\u201d he said.Mr. Christie watched with confusion and a bit of awe, he recalled in the interview. Mr. Trump looked at him and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll love it.\u201dBut Mr. Trump, who frets about germs and prizes cleanliness, also loves fast food because of its consistency and the promise, at least, of a basic level of hygiene.\u201cOne bad hamburger, you can destroy McDonald\u2019s. One bad hamburger, you take Wendy\u2019s and all these other places and they\u2019re out of business,\u201d Mr. Trump told Mr. Cooper of CNN. \u201cI\u2019m a very clean person. I like cleanliness, and I think you\u2019re better off going there than maybe someplace that you have no idea where the food\u2019s coming from. It\u2019s a certain standard.\u201dStill, he added, \u201cI think the food\u2019s good.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s dining habits also bespeak a certain lack of creativity, and parochialism \u2014 the kid from Queens who made it across the river to Manhattan\u2019s glistening skyline, but never cottoned to the city\u2019s haute cuisine. He once praised the \u201cimagination\u201d of his wife, Melania, in the kitchen \u2014 before citing, as examples of her culinary derring-do, spaghetti and meat sauce, salads and meatloaf. (He still keeps a copy of his mother\u2019s meatloaf recipe.) Along with McDonald\u2019s, his favorite fast food joint, a family member said, is Jackson Hole Burgers.He is also a stickler for manners, attacking his primary race rival, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, for scarfing down meals during impromptu news conferences. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a human being eat in such a disgusting fashion!\u201d Mr. Trump told a crowd.And Mr. Trump, who sometimes sips his Diet Coke through a straw, once caused Manhattan foodies to weep into their quinoa when he took Sarah Palin to a Famous Famiglia pizza restaurant in Times Square \u2014 and then proceeded to cut his oversize slice with a plastic knife and fork.So pronounced are Mr. Trump\u2019s fast food preferences that Philip E. Beshara, a Washington-based lawyer, joked on Instagram that, as president, his cabinet would probably be staffed by Colonel Sanders, the Hamburglar and the Taco Bell Chihuahua.And, of course, the Republican nominee\u2019s dining whims also keep his team on its toes, with staff members worrying not just about the backdrop for his speeches \u2014 but also where to find the nearest drive-through.\u201cThere\u2019s never any real planning for food,\u201d said one, between events on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s always just whatever he is craving, which is more often than not McDonald\u2019s.\u201dNick Corasaniti and Kitty Bennett contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018It Absolutely Has Created Fear\u2019: 2 Killings Prompt Female Joggers to Alter Routines", "Date": "2016-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe two deaths occurred just days apart and had eerily similar details \u2014 each time, a woman went jogging during the day in an isolated area and wound up dead.Though one woman\u2019s body was discovered in Massachusetts and the other in Queens, and the authorities do not believe the two attacks were related, the killings have unnerved many female runners. Some are now rethinking their routines.Around 1:15 p.m. on Sunday, Vanessa Marcotte, 27, left her mother\u2019s home in Princeton, Mass., to go for a run on a wooded country road nearby, according to a spokesman with the Worcester County district attorney\u2019s office. Ms. Marcotte was visiting town from her home in New York City, where she worked as a Google marketing account manager.After she had been gone for more than two and a half hours, the police began looking for Ms. Marcotte. Later that night, a State Police canine unit found her body about a half-mile from her mother\u2019s home. The police began a homicide investigation, but have not made any arrests. An autopsy report had not been completed as of Tuesday afternoon.Police officials in New York said they did not believe the episode was related to the death last Tuesday of Karina Vetrano, 30, in the Howard Beach neighborhood. Ms. Vetrano was sexually assaulted and strangled during a run in a nature preserve near her home, the police said.The news of the two joggers\u2019 deaths has prompted anxiety among female runners in New York City and caused many to question their safety while running alone.\u201cIt absolutely has created fear,\u201d said Kathy Ioannou, leader of the Brooklyn chapter of She Runs This Town, a running group for women. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel comfortable running alone. We\u2019re frightened.\u201dMs. Ioannou, 51, said she had seen a \u201chuge spike\u201d in the last two days of women from her group asking her to set up more group runs so that members did not have to go alone.She has made changes to her own running route, choosing to run in the street against traffic instead of in the golf course near her home in Dyker Heights, Brooklyn. She has also stopped running with headphones and has not left the house without her Road ID, which contains her emergency contact information.In search of long stretches of continuous road, many runners venture to unfamiliar places so they can log more miles. Ms. Ioannou said she had been planning on going to the Howard Beach area for an 18-mile run before she heard about the attack there.\u201cIt brought light to all of us that we just can\u2019t do the things we\u2019re used to doing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t fair, but it\u2019s smart.\u201dAs the peak of the marathon season approaches, many women are leaving home early in the morning \u2014 sometimes while it is still dark \u2014 to try to squeeze long runs into their schedules, said Melody Davis, a Brooklyn resident and a member of the group Black Girls Run.\u201cWhat\u2019s really unnerving is that both of these latest situations happened in daylight,\u201d Ms. Davis said. \u201cThe question becomes, Then when can I go run?\u201dSome members of her group have suggested using phone apps that can map runners\u2019 locations so that relatives can track their whereabouts.

She said she also tried to avoid going by herself.

On Tuesday, one friend posted a photo of herself and Ms. Marcotte on Facebook taking part in a race together.For the past year and a half, Ms. Marcotte had been working as an account manager in health care at Google\u2019s New York City office, according to her LinkedIn profile.

{"Headline": "Google Duo Makes Video Calling Between Operating Systems Easier", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "Supported byTech FixGoogle and Apple have battled each other for years for primacy over mobile users. Apple has proferred its superior devices, like the iPhone. Google has fought back with its Android operating system and a series of mobile apps that are more flexible and compatible with a broader set of devices than Apple\u2019s apps.The app fits squarely into Google\u2019s playbook in mobile. Over the last few years, Google has increasingly offered its important software and internet services, including Google Maps, Google Photos and Google Docs, to iPhone customers. All of those apps were compelling alternatives to Apple\u2019s proprietary apps, like Apple Maps, Photos and Notes, because they work on a wider variety of devices, including Macs, Windows PCs, Android devices and iPhones.Duo is no exception. People can only use FaceTime to call others who have Apple devices. But Duo lets you place video calls between Android and iPhone users, and sizably increases the universe of people with whom you can hold a video conversation.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to worry about whether your call will connect, or if your friend is using the same type of device as you are,\u201d Google said in a statement, in a veiled jab at Apple. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder that nearly half of U.S. adults never make video calls on mobile.\u201dAll of this feeds into Google\u2019s strategy to attract iPhone users over to Android. Google\u2019s apps generally work better on Android devices than on iPhones, so the more that people get hooked on Google\u2019s core apps, the less incentive there is to stay loyal to Apple.Nick Fox, Google\u2019s head of communication products, said the top priority with Duo was to build a great product and to increase the use of video calling among Android users. But he added that making Android more attractive to iPhone owners was a secondary motive. He said that Duo\u2019s appeal was that it was simple to use, fast and more widely accessible.\u201cOur view is video calling should work for everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can only call half the people you know, that\u2019s very limiting.\u201d\u201cOur year-to-date iPhone sales to switchers are the greatest we\u2019ve seen in any nine-month period,\u201d Mr. Cook said in the call, without disclosing precise figures.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment beyond Mr. Cook\u2019s comments.I decided to test Duo to see how the new app plays into the debate about whether iPhone users should consider switching to Android devices. After trying an early copy of Duo and comparing it side by side with FaceTime, I found that Duo was just as intuitive and fun to use as FaceTime, but that it was too early to tell which service was more reliable.A Short HistoryThis is not the first time Google has provided video calling. Google started offering mobile video calling several years ago inside its Hangouts app, which also includes messaging and voice-calling capabilities. The video-calling feature in Hangouts will remain intact.Crystal Dahlen, a Google spokeswoman, said the name Duo conveyed that the app was designed for one-to-one video calling on mobile devices, in contrast to Hangouts, which lets groups of people make video calls over mobile devices and computers. Duo will roll out globally over the next few days.FaceTime, in contrast, is now six years old. When Apple unveiled the video-calling ability in iPhones in 2010, Steven P. Jobs, Apple\u2019s co-founder, said he had dreamed of mobile video calling since he grew up watching \u201cThe Jetsons\u201d and \u201cStar Trek.\u201d Apple later expanded FaceTime to work with iPads and Macs, among other Apple products. The company has not published statistics on FaceTime use, but the technology helped make mobile video calling mainstream.Duo Versus FaceTimeThe Duo app is downloadable and free through Google\u2019s Play store and Apple\u2019s App Store. When you open the Duo app, there is just one button: video call. Tapping that loads your contacts list, and from there you can choose whom to call.Duo starts streaming video to a recipient as soon as the call is placed, meaning the person you are calling will be able to see you waving or making faces before he or she picks up. Google calls this feature Knock Knock. It can be disabled in case you have friends who are likely to make inappropriate hand gestures.With FaceTime, you place a call directly through the iPhone\u2019s contacts list or through the separate FaceTime app. The recipient does not see the video streaming until after the call is answered.I placed video calls over Duo and FaceTime over a strong Wi-Fi connection as well as a weak cellular connection. In the tests, the video calls looked clearer on Duo, though that is an unreliable measure because very few people are currently able to use Duo, so the network is unrealistically uncongested. When more people use Duo, we can expect the picture quality to vary depending on network traffic and internet speeds.There is a minor difference for Duo between Android and iPhone users. An Android user receiving a Duo call will see a Knock Knock video on the home screen by default. Those using Apple devices will see a notification on top of the screen and will have to open the Duo app before seeing Knock Knock in action. Otherwise, the app works the same for both Android and iPhone.Against the RestI also compared Duo calls with video calls placed over Microsoft\u2019s Skype and Facebook Messenger. Against those two, Duo\u2019s simplicity won hands down.In Facebook\u2019s Messenger app, the video-calling feature is embedded in the corner of a message box, so it is hard to find and not intuitive to use. In fact, every call I have ever made with Messenger has been by mistake.On Skype, the video-calling feature is in a place similar to Messenger\u2019s, in the corner of a message box. More annoyingly, to find other Skype users you have to manually add them to your Skype contacts list or toggle on an option to synchronize your address book with Skype.The Bottom LineFor now, FaceTime is just as intuitive as Duo so I see no compelling reason to use Duo over FaceTime to call iPhone users.But if I had to video call an Android user, I would use Duo over other video-calling services like Skype or Facebook Messenger, which have more cluttered interfaces than Duo\u2019s single-button approach.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Daily Report: More Clean Energy, Brought to You by the Cloud", "Date": "2016-08-24", "News": "Supported byBitsThe cloud, as it turns out, may have a very green lining.A prime reason for this is the growing demand from its cloud computing centers, where Apple keeps its customers\u2019 music, photos and much more.On this front, Apple joins a number of other cloud providers, who collectively may change the face of energy production by increasing demand for renewable energy.Big cloud-computing companies are building facilities on an unparalleled scale, and at a time when few others are increasing demand. Dominion Virginia Power, which supplies perhaps the world\u2019s greatest concentration of data centers, reported that overall demand rose 1 percent last year, but demand from data centers rose 9 percent.Amazon Web Services has since committed to obtaining 100 percent of its power from renewable sources. Last year the company purchased a 250,000-panel, 80-megawatt plant in Virginia, which it later sold to Dominion.Other data centers have long been situated near big dams, which provide cheap as well as green power. Lots of building is happening in Iowa, Texas and elsewhere in America\u2019s great wind corridor, to encourage the construction of more wind-driven facilities.Remote locations have other benefits. \u201cWhen your nearest neighbor is 100 acres away, you don\u2019t get as many complaints about the power lines,\u201d said Joe Kava, who heads Google\u2019s data center operations.There are signs it is affecting the way utilities plan future construction. American Electric Power, which operates in 11 states, has said it will add 6,300 megawatts of new wind power and 3,100 megawatts of new solar generation before 2033. An AEP official told me that much of this was attributable to demand from data centers.For many of these companies, it\u2019s not just about saving the planet; power has moved from an incidental cost to a main determinant of profitability. Like nothing else, that has affected the operation of data centers in ways that may improve other big companies\u2019 power consumption.The traditional measure of data center efficiency is power usage effectiveness, or P.U.E. This measures how much power goes into a data center and how much of that is used by computing equipment. For a poorly run center, this number can be 2.0 or higher, meaning it takes two watts of power to put one watt into a computer.Together, these companies are building with their clouds a new kind of industrial infrastructure. It would be something if it also reshaped our power usage for the better.Advertisement"}

Dual citizens are in a privileged position of being able to judge certain things as \u201cbetter\u201d in one country than the other. Yet such comparisons are often folly.It\u2019s admirable that countries like Finland, Norway and the Netherlands exhibit more social solidarity across the political spectrum than the United States. But to a large degree this is a function of the Nordic and Dutch models having a much stronger central government. The American political structure grants far more authority to state and local governments with hugely varied preferences.Additionally, given its population size, heterogeneity and rather fragmented social fabric, it\u2019s unsurprising that the United States isn\u2019t like Finland. It\u2019s important to appreciate differences, and not to patronize by suggesting how foolish we Americans are not to adopt a different social model. Finland may be an almost perfectly organized nation. However, it\u2019s presumptuous to think that America would aspire to be like Finland.JOSHUA P.

These snippets may be live, but they conflate live information with news, and streaming as-it-happens video with truth.A live collection of videos reflects the perspective of the person streaming the video, and its truth value is a function of how that person positions the camera, what he or she displays, what is left out and what occurred before the incident that critically influenced the images that are shown.This is particularly problematic in the case of streaming videos of highly charged incidents, like police violence against civilians, where the person taking pictures may have strong views that determine the images that are transmitted.To the extent that Facebook or Twitter users infer that the streamed images reflect reality, the new news is as problematic as the breaking news of cable of yore, which in its prime also elicited perceptions of truth rather than nuanced appreciation of the limitations in news.RICHARD M.

The hope is that the money will be an incentive to keep those flaws out of the hands of organized groups or spy agencies willing to pay big money to learn about them.But Apple had stayed away from the practice. Instead, it had credited anyone who turned over bugs by putting their names on its website \u2014 a far cry from the tens of thousands of dollars, and in some cases hundreds of thousands of dollars, companies like Google and Facebook were willing to pay.The annual Black Hat conference, now in its 19th year, is a gathering place for all sorts of experts on computer security, including hackers, tech industry executives and government officials.Dan Kaminsky, a respected security researcher, said in a keynote speech that the industry was falling far short of expectations.

{"Headline": "6.2-Magnitude Earthquake Shakes Italy, Killing at Least 10", "Date": "2016-08-23", "News": "Supported by7 PhotosROME \u2014 Strong earthquakes struck central Italy early Wednesday, killing at least 10 people, trapping many others under debris and setting off tremors that awakened residents in Rome nearly 100 miles to the southwest.The first, a 6.2-magnitude earthquake, struck at 3:36 a.m. near the town of Accumoli, in the province of Rieti, which the Civil Protection Department identified as among the hardest hit, along with the nearby towns of Amatrice and Arquata del Tronto.The mayor of Accumoli, Stefano Petrucci, reported that six people had been killed there, the news agency ANSA reported at least two dead in Amatrice, and at least two more were said to have been killed in Pescara del Tronto in the province of Ascoli Piceno.The death toll was expected to rise, with the Italian public broadcaster reporting that at least 24 people had been killed.More than 39 strong earthquakes were reported over a three-hour period, officials said, and rescue teams and volunteers from around Italy were on the way to the stricken areas to assist.In Amatrice, Mayor Sergio Pirozzi said, \u201cHalf the town no longer exists.\u201dMr. Pirozzi said that the number of victims was uncertain and that rescue teams were digging through the rubble of crumbled buildings, \u201choping that most people were alive,\u201d but he said that the historic center had been destroyed.\u201cThe problem is removing people from under the rubble,\u201d he said. Asked how many people he thought were still trapped or dead underneath debris, he said, \u201cmany, many.\u201dHe added that Amatrice had been cut off because of damage to roads and a bridge, and he appealed during a live television broadcast for assistance.Ambulances raced back and forth on one of the main roads to Amatrice, where a courtyard in a still-standing palazzo had been turned into an impromptu morgue.CNN showed footage of construction equipment being used to try to comb through giant pieces of debris in Amatrice and of rescuers standing on huge piles of rubble where homes once stood, evidence of the enormous scale of the rescue effort.\u201cWe need chain saws, shears to cut iron bars and jacks to remove beams,\u201d a civil protection worker, Andrea Gentili, told The Associated Press. \u201cEverything, we need everything.\u201dA look at earthquakes in Italy that have caused extensive damage over the last century.The paths of destruction led to other places, including the Tyrrhenian coast. A witness in Sperlonga, a popular seaside town in Lazio, said that the historic city center had been seriously damaged, and news channels showed photographs of crumbled buildings and rubble-covered cars.The earthquake was felt from Rome to Bologna, in Emilia-Romagna, in a broad area pockmarked with dozens of small towns. Italian officials said it was difficult to gauge the number of casualties or the damage as the ground kept trembling through the night.Fabrizio Curcio, the director of the Civil Protection Department, said that the earthquake had been severe and that national emergency procedures had been activated.Mr. Curcio said mayors in the affected areas were monitoring the damage to their areas.\u201cThey know the territory best,\u201d he said.By early morning, rescue operations had been able to reach the most damaged towns, he said, adding, \u201cWe have to carry out an analysis of the territory and see if there are other places that have to be reached.\u201dOn social media, there were many reports of friends or relatives being buried or trapped, and local residents said that the rescue effort was hindered by the fact that rescue teams were having difficulty getting to the mountainous area, where most towns are reachable only along winding country roads.In Norcia, dozens of residents wrapped in blankets greeted the dawn in the town\u2019s main square. \u201cMuch of our patrimony is damaged, but there are no victims,\u201d Mayor Nicola Alemanno told RaiNews24. \u201cThat is the good news.\u201dThe National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology reported that there had been nearly a dozen other earthquakes in the affected area over the course of about two hours.

The track body, the International Association of Athletics Federations, has barred the rest of the team in the wake of revelations of an elaborate, state-sponsored doping program in Russia.Three days before the long-jump event for which she was registered, Klishina\u2019s participation was threatened. She was barred from the Games on Saturday after an investigation found that a past urine sample of hers had suspicious scratches on the bottle and contained DNA from two people, suggesting it had been tampered with.Klishina, 25, promptly appealed to world sports\u2019 arbitration court. The court ruled in her favor early Monday, after a four-hour hearing at an oceanside hotel here and numerous hours of deliberation.Russia has a history of success across disciplines at the Summer Games, but track and field is a centerpiece of its sports program, typically delivering the nation\u2019s largest count of medals.Klishina, due to compete on Tuesday in her first Olympics, had expressed frustration at the I.A.A.F. decision on Saturday and insisted she had not doped.Her lawyer, Paul J. Greene, argued before the sports court that the evidence was circumstantial and that Klishina had been denied basic due process by not being able to see it, analyze it and challenge it before the sports authorities rejected her.Officials pointed to revelations that drug violations had been routinely covered up by Russian antidoping authorities, who investigators said broke into supposedly tamper-proof bottles \u2014 leaving microscopic scratch marks \u2014 and swapped out the steroid-laced urine of Russian athletes, sometimes substituting in the clean urine of different people.Klishina \u2014 who has trained outside Russia, in Florida, for the last three years \u2014 was the only Russian athlete cleared to compete by the track organization and the International Olympic Committee. Nearly 70 other applications were rejected.But in recent weeks, a continuing investigation into Russian doping commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency raised questions about Klishina\u2019s drug-test history, suggesting that a urine sample of hers had been tampered with. That sample was taken during the last two years, the court said.Asked what the presence of two DNA profiles in one sample signified, Richard Budgett, the medical and scientific director of the International Olympic Committee, said on Monday, \u201cYou do not expect to find two people\u2019s urine in the same sample bottle.\u201dHe added, \u201cThat would be a case of manipulation.\u201dGreene, Klishina\u2019s lawyer, said her case had partly asserted that the I.A.A.F. did not have the authority to revisit its final decision. It also pointed to her years in the United States, where she was subject to drug tests.\"At this moment,\u201d Klishina wrote on Facebook on Saturday, after she had arrived in Rio, \u201cI cannot help but feel betrayed by a system that is not focused on keeping the sport clean and supporting rank-and-file athletes, but rather seeking victories outside sport arenas.\u201dThe International Olympic Committee expressed support for the supreme authority of the sports court on Monday. \u201cWe totally respect the decision,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cWe have to respect the decision.\u201dKlishina is set to compete on Tuesday, with a final competition for long jump set to take place on Wednesday.An earlier version of this article misstated the ruling by the arbitration court. As the article correctly noted elsewhere, the court overturned the decision, it did not uphold it.slide showAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Father in Holland Tunnel Arms Case: Antidrug Hero, or Vigilante?", "Date": "2016-08-23", "News": "Supported byAs he sits in a jail in Kearny, N.J. \u2014 he does not have the $75,000 to pay his bail \u2014 John Cramsey makes no apologies for the journey that brought him there.The only thing he would have done differently before the mission to Brooklyn that ended in his arrest would have been to clear out his truck first, Mr. Cramsey said.\u201cIf I got called to come back to New York and help another child out, would I?\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re damn right I would.\u201dBut Mr. Cramsey\u2019s journey began long before that morning, in Lehigh County, Pa., a suburban area about a two-hour drive from New York City where Mr. Cramsey owns an indoor shooting range. The area has become a local nexus in a national heroin and opioid epidemic.But some of Mr. Cramsey\u2019s actions have raised concerns.Just weeks after his 20-year-old daughter died from an overdose, Mr. Cramsey stood before a gathering at a drug awareness program in Allentown, Pa., talking about Alexandria, his \u201cbaby girl,\u201d and telling the group that even the addicts among them were like family to him.Mr. Cramsey also spoke with a rougher edge, telling the group that he owned a shirt that read, \u201cShoot Your Local Heroin Dealer.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m wearing it right now,\u201d he said.He said Alexandria\u2019s death, from an overdose of heroin and fentanyl, had pushed him to try to help other drug users instead of seeking vengeance. \u201cI\u2019m the inoculation to this disease,\u201d Mr. Cramsey said. \u201cMy voice is going to be heard all around the country.\u201dThe Lehigh County district attorney, James B. Martin, said he was so troubled after hearing Mr. Cramsey speak at another meeting that he sent a detective to talk to him.\u201cHe made some comments that indicated to law enforcement that he wanted to take things into his own hands; we reacted to it,\u201d Mr. Martin said. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with the approach he\u2019s taken. I can\u2019t condone vigilantism.\u201dMr. Cramsey disputed that characterization. \u201cI\u2019m not a vigilante,\u201d he said during a series of telephone interviews from the correctional center. \u201cI\u2019m a father who cares enough to try and bring other kids home.\u201dTo that end, Mr. Cramsey started an anti-heroin group on Facebook, called Enough Is Enough, and began getting calls from friends and relatives of drug users seeking help, he said. Mr. Cramsey said he usually began his interventions by talking about his daughter, who had worked as a model, and showing the image of her tattooed on his arm.In just a few months, he estimated, he had helped dozens of people. \u201cI have literally brought kids back from the dark side, kids that would have stayed in that darkness until they were brought out in a body bag,\u201d he said.In fact, J. Layne Turner, the drug and alcohol administrator for Lehigh County, said that he knew of three people Mr. Cramsey had delivered to treatment centers in the month and a half before he was arrested.Mr. Turner described Mr. Cramsey\u2019s involvement in terms of a recent trend, with parents going public about the destruction caused by drugs, pushing back against the stigma associated with addiction. \u201cParents have felt such shame,\u201d he said.Andrew Miller, 28, who has struggled with addiction, said he could not find a treatment center that was willing to accept him without health insurance.Within an hour of meeting Mr. Cramsey, Mr. Miller said, he had been checked into a rehabilitation center.\u201cThere\u2019s nobody I\u2019ve met that cares as much as him,\u201d Mr. Miller said. Though Mr. Miller relapsed this summer, he is now in a sober living center, his mother, Cyndi, said in a recent interview. Cyndi requested that her last name not be used to protect her privacy.Jennifer Dotel, of Northampton, Pa., said that after she contacted Mr. Cramsey on Facebook, he rushed to her house to speak with her 25-year-old son, Nicholas Quinn.She said she had struggled to get her son into treatment and welcomed the speed with which Mr. Cramsey came to her aid. Ms. Dotel, who is raising Mr. Quinn\u2019s toddler son, said that after Mr. Cramsey\u2019s visit her son was honest about his problem for the first time. Mr. Cramsey, she said, has helped bring heroin awareness to the forefront. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of,\u201d Ms. Dotel said. Her son is still struggling to get his life on track, she said.In Lehigh County, overdose deaths rose so sharply in 2015 \u2014 to a record 115 \u2014 that the coroner, Scott Grim, had to ask for additional funding to perform autopsies. With 95 overdose deaths so far in 2016, the county was expected to exceed 140 for the year. \u201cThat\u2019s an extremely disturbing number,\u201d Mr. Grim said.Mr. Cramsey, Mr. Smith and Ms. Arendt remain in jail. If they are convicted of the felony weapons charges, each could face about 10 years in prison, a spokesman for the Hudson County prosecutor\u2019s office said. Prosecutors have argued that the group\u2019s actions had the \u201cpotential to bring danger.\u201dMr. Cramsey\u2019s lawyer, James Lisa, has said that the decision to stop Mr. Cramsey\u2019s truck \u2014 a decision made, officials said, based on a cracked windshield \u2014 was unconstitutional.Mr. Cramsey has other challenges ahead. His shooting range, Higher Ground Tactical, which had been issued 12 violations and fined $135,000 by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for \u201cwillfully\u201d exposing its workers to lead and noise hazards in May, was burglarized in July. It closed shortly thereafter.Gina Cramsey, Alexandria\u2019s mother, questioned the sincerity of her former husband\u2019s antidrug work. She described him as an \u201cevery other weekend dad.\u201d Ms. Cramsey said she did not believe her daughter knowingly took the drugs that killed her and did not support Mr. Cramsey\u2019s use of Alexandria\u2019s name in his work.Enough Is Enough has shut down as well. Its page was deleted from Facebook in July.Mr. Cramsey admitted that his anti-heroin mission had begun to consume him. \u201cI neglected my other three children; I couldn\u2019t be around other people. My social life was shot. I couldn\u2019t go to work,\u201d he said.Still, Mr. Cramsey said, he has continued his work while in jail, and started an intervention there by showing a man the tattoo of his daughter.\u201cIt\u2019s the sorrow, and the pain in my heart, that these people are listening to,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

I don\u2019t think it takes a social scientist to understand that the general tenor of American society right now is that we\u2019re all wound up pretty tight.\u201dThe recent false-alarm panics injured dozens of people, some of them seriously.Kokila Patel, 66, and her husband, Manu, 74, had just finished lunch at a Panera in the Crabtree Valley Mall in Raleigh on Aug. 13 when she heard a noise and turned to see panicked shoppers surging toward them. People had taken still-unexplained sounds for gunshots, screamed, dived into stores and made a chaotic rush for the exits, paying little heed to what was in their way \u2014 including the Patels.The crowd knocked the couple down and trampled Ms. Patel, breaking her right femur and leaving her to wait in searing pain for two hours until police officers in tactical gear arrived and helped carry her out of the mall on a plastic display table. Surgeons braced her shattered leg with a steel rod, plate and screws, but the pain is still intense. Ms. Patel, who usually travels to India for three months each year with her husband, remains homebound.Mr. Patel said he could see fear on the faces of the people who rushed over him and his wife.\u201cThey thought that somebody\u2019s there to kill them,\u201d he said. \u201cPsychologically, we have been damaged.\u201dSocial media feeds that kind of frenzy, said Roxane Cohen Silver, a professor of psychology and social behavior at the University of California, Irvine.\u201cThere\u2019s rapid dissemination of information on social media that\u2019s not being filtered by anybody,\u201d she said. \u201cThis provides the unfortunate opportunity for rumors to be transmitted very quickly, without any ability to evaluate the veracity.\u201dBefore there were television news reports about what was happening at the Los Angeles airport, she said, her son in Chicago had called to tell her, \u201cI\u2019m watching Twitter videos of people running at LAX.\u201dAt the Florida Mall in Orlando, popping balloons were apparently mistaken for gunshots. At the Twelve Oaks Mall in Novi, Mich., it was a glass door toppling to the floor, knocked over by thieves who had smashed a glass display case in a jewelry store to grab two luxury watches.As the robbers ran, so did shoppers, and people posted videos of the chaotic scene on social media and said \u2014 falsely \u2014 that shots had been fired. That message spread fast, and calls to the Novi police overwhelmed the 911 system, shunting overflow callers to the state police.\u201cIt\u2019s a wildfire you try to control,\u201d said Detective Sgt. Scott Baetens of the Novi Police Department. \u201cWe try to put out timely and accurate information. But you can\u2019t put it out fast enough to beat Twitter and Facebook.\u201dOnce people start to flee, it is fairly normal for others to join in, experts say \u2014 even people who did not hear any suspicious sounds or rumors of terrorism. But people who study crowd psychology and the fear of terrorism say the steady stream of news reports of bloodshed has heightened anxieties out of proportion to the threat, making panic more likely to take hold.\u201cThis overexposure can cause increased fear, anxiety and helplessness, particularly in already psychologically vulnerable populations,\u201d said Daniel Antonius, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University at Buffalo. He described \u201ca national anxiety\u201d about mass attacks that did not reflect the real level of danger.Dr. Horgan stressed that in addition to physical violence, \u201cterrorism is fundamentally a form of psychological warfare, and it\u2019s one of the greatest ironies that we help give it its strength in our reactions to it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Everyone knows who is behind this,\u201d he said. \u201cSome states and their political-sports establishments looked for a traditional adversary, and they found it, as they usually do.\u201dThe prime minister also took an angry swipe at Dr. Rodchenkov, saying it \u201cis especially despicable that some scum first cram performance-enhancing drugs down their athletes\u2019 throats, take prohibited substances across the border and then bolt across the ocean to give court testimony in exchange for the promise of participation in a witness protection program and future financial dividends.\u201dWhile world antidoping authorities were examining Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s allegations and finding them credible, Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee, a rough equivalent of the F.B.I., opened a criminal case against the whistle-blower in June for \u201cabuse of authority,\u201d accusing him of being responsible for any doping by Russian athletes.Russia\u2019s case against Dr. Rodchenkov took a bizarre new twist this week when the head of the Investigative Committee\u2019s media department, Vladimir Markin, asserted that the whistle-blower was part of a conspiracy against Russia orchestrated by the World Anti-Doping Agency.It was not the Russian authorities but WADA itself, Mr. Markin said on Tuesday, that ordered Dr. Rodchenkov to tamper with the athletes\u2019 urine samples.Russia appealed the decision to ban it from the Paralympic Games to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland, but the court this week upheld the ban, setting off a wave of fury from Russian athletes and officials.State television has been flooded with interviews with weeping handicapped athletes and outraged comments over a purported Western plot to keep Russia down and humiliate even its weakest, most vulnerable citizens.A talk show on the Rossiya 1 television channel on Sunday focused on angry denunciations of Western bullying with guests shouting down one speaker who tried to suggest that Russian officials were themselves to blame because they had let doping go unchecked for so long.Oleg Matsnev and Lincoln Pigman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Times to Shelve NYT Now App", "Date": "2016-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn early 2014, The New York Times introduced an app called NYT Now that would provide a curated list of stories \u2014 for a lower price than a full digital subscription \u2014 to what it hoped would be a younger, mobile-savvy audience. Jill Abramson, then the executive editor of The Times, unveiled the app at the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Tex.NYT Now was among the first attempts by The Times to enhance its appeal to mobile users as it looked for new revenue sources that would offset drops in print advertising and circulation. By giving readers a curated subset of daily articles in a mobile-friendly, lower-priced package, The Times hoped to attract a broader audience that might otherwise not subscribe. The subscription price for NYT Now, $8 a month, was roughly half the price of the least expensive digital subscription.But the app never quite took off as The Times had hoped, and last year, it transitioned from subscription to free in the hopes that the new model might give The Times more of an opportunity to expand its audience.Kinsey Wilson, the executive vice president for product and technology, said the decision to do away with NYT Now was driven in part by a shift in how the company thinks about broadening its audience. The Times, with the help of its audience development team, now looks more to third-party platforms like Facebook and Twitter to expand its reach among younger readers.\u201cThat gave us a different ability to tap into younger audiences and to provide exposure to a much, much wider audience,\u201d Mr. Wilson said.Many features of NYT Now \u2014 including morning and evening news briefings, bullet-point lists and a more conversational tone \u2014 have also been incorporated into The Times\u2019s main news products, including the core mobile app, he said.At its peak, in May 2015, NYT Now had 334,000 total unique users. The app averaged 257,000 unique users in the last three months.NYT Now is not the first app The Times has retired. In 2014, it shut down NYT Opinion because it failed to gain much traction.

Bloomberg, as a wealthy businessman and an outsider to politics with the management chops needed to run the nation\u2019s biggest city.But if Mr. Massey, a Republican, wanted to project the image of a capable manager, his first act as a declared candidate did little to help that cause.Although a news release announced that Mr. Massey had filed papers to begin his run for mayor with the city\u2019s Campaign Finance Board, a spokesman for the board, Matthew Sollars, said that officials there were not aware of having received any such filing.At the same time, John Conklin, a spokesman for the State Board of Elections, said that papers were filed on Thursday to form a political committee called Massey for Mayor 2017 \u2014 but that the filing was missing a required document and the papers were returned.Although Mr. Massey is little known outside the real estate world, and will have to work mightily to achieve the name recognition needed to make a successful run for mayor, he turned down a request for an interview.\u201cHe\u2019s not doing any interviews right now,\u201d a spokeswoman, Jessica Proud, said. \u201cIt\u2019s a soft launch.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Massey, William F.

{"Headline": "Unlikely Facebook Friendship Saves Afghan Baby With Heart Defect", "Date": "2016-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOLON, Israel \u2014 They had never met, but they were Facebook friends connected across thousands of miles. Together the two digital acquaintances \u2014 a young English teacher in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, and a retired State Department official living in Haifa, Israel \u2014 collaborated to save a baby in Pakistan with life-threatening congenital heart problems.Yehia, now 14 months old, had been born with his two main arteries reversed and two holes in his heart. His parents, Afghans living in Peshawar, Pakistan, found a local specialist who could perform the necessary surgery, but the price tag was $7,000. It might as well have been seven figures to the child\u2019s father, who makes his living selling flour. The family\u2019s savings, $200, had already been depleted by medical bills.On a trip to Afghanistan for a family wedding in April, they sought out a relative, Farhad Zaheer, a teacher in Jalalabad who speaks English and is active on social media. Could he help? \u201cNo problem,\u201d Mr. Zaheer, 29, recalls telling them. \u201cI said, \u2018I know lots of people, and I will contact them.\u2019\u201dAmong the people he contacted was Anna Mussman, 69, who has both American and Israeli citizenship. Mr. Zaheer had sent Ms. Mussman a friend request in 2012 after he worked on a project training teachers in Nouristan Province, which Ms. Mussman was overseeing for the State Department. He remembered Ms. Mussman, he said, because she commented kindly on his posts.Social media has flattened communications across the globe, sometimes allowing for remarkable connections like this.\u201cHello dear Madam!\u201d Mr. Zaheer wrote in a Facebook message, with a photo of young Yehia attached. \u201cThis boy is my cousin who has been suffering from hole in heart. If you can do anything for his good health, we would be very thankful to you.\u201d Ms. Mussman, who was born to Holocaust survivors in a displaced persons camp in Germany, jumped. Within a few hours she had contacted Simon Fisher, the executive director of Save a Child\u2019s Heart, an Israeli charity that she had heard about once on CNN. The group provides free surgeries to children from developing countries.\u201cI realize helping a child from a country which Israel has no diplomatic relations is not easy, but perhaps possible,\u201d Ms. Mussman wrote to Mr. Fisher in an email. \u201cThanks so much and Shabbat Shalom.\u201dIt did not get any less complicated from there. Numerous other strangers and acquaintances helped plot a multicountry medical odyssey that barely skirted last month\u2019s failed coup attempt in Turkey and culminated in an eight-hour surgery on July 30 at Wolfson Medical Center here in Holon, a city near Tel Aviv.Yehia \u2014 whose father spoke on the condition that the family name not be published for fear of a backlash if it became known he had taken the boy to Israel for treatment \u2014 is the first Afghan treated by Save a Child\u2019s Heart in its 20 years of operations. About half the charity\u2019s 4,000 patients have been Palestinian; 200 others were children from Iraq and Syria, and the roster includes patients from Tanzania, Ethiopia and Moldova.Israel boosters often highlight such programs as examples of the small nation\u2019s outsized humanitarian efforts, including to hostile neighbors. Leora Robinson, a second-year medical student in Britain who is doing an internship at the charity, said that it provided an important counterpoint to portrayals of Israel as an occupier of Palestinian land, as she saw on campus during Israel Apartheid Week. \u201cIt opens eyes to the fact that this country doesn\u2019t just have one side to it,\u201d Ms. Robinson said.But Tony Laurance, head of a group called Medical Aid for Palestinians, said that while providing children \u201cworld-class surgery\u201d was \u201can unequivocal good,\u201d it should not obscure the broader impact of Israeli policies on medical care for Palestinians. Gaza hospitals are perennially short of medicine, equipment and well-trained staff members, and many Gaza residents struggle to get exit permits for care outside the territory.\u201cWhat gets up my nose,\u201d Mr. Laurance said, \u201cis that it presents an image of Israel that betrays the reality.\u201dMr. Fisher, executive director of Save a Child\u2019s Heart, said his organization did not represent Israel\u2019s government, \u201cbut it does represent Israeli society.\u201d Public and private foundations and governments provide the annual budget of $3.5 million, he said, and about 70 health care workers volunteer their time.It was Mr. Fisher who, drawing on years of contacts, obtained Israeli visas for Yehia and his father after Ms. Mussman contacted him. But they would have to travel through Turkey.Ms. Moini volunteered to meet Yehia and his father in Istanbul, accompany them to Tel Aviv, and be an extra pair of hands to care for him.But her July 15 flight was canceled because of the attempted coup in Turkey. Save a Child\u2019s Heart managed to find her a last-minute flight out of Toronto to Istanbul.Mr. Fisher of Save a Child\u2019s Heart worked to find a translator to help the father, who speaks Urdu and Pashto, communicate with the Hebrew-speaking staff. He remembered that during his time in the Israeli Army he had served with a soldier whose mother came from Kabul\u2019s ancient Jewish community. He called the soldier, Yossi Betsalel \u2014 could his mother, Tsipora, translate? No, Mr. Betsalel said, she had long forgotten her native tongue. But she had a relative \u2013 Jacob Gul, 56, a retired rug seller, who had left Kabul 32 years ago and was probably still proficient. Mr. Gul immediately agreed to translate, and Ms. Betsalel ended up visiting Yehia in the hospital frequently.Unaware of those efforts, back in Jalalabad, Mr. Zaheer contacted another Facebook connection he had never met: Michael Davidson, a 70-year-old Israeli who had immigrated from India in 1978 \u2014 and who speaks Urdu. Mr. Davidson and Mr. Gul were both on hand in Holon for the surgery, along with Ms. Moini and Ms. Betsalel, who said she had closed her clothing shop early because she could not concentrate while Yehia was having his operation.Dr. Yahyu Mekonnen, 33, an Ethiopian surgeon, opened Yehia\u2019s chest. Dr. Lior Sasson, who headed an operating team of nearly a dozen people, hummed an Israeli song while they stopped his tiny heart, to patch it up.Eventually, they wheeled Yehia out, covered in bandages, even over his eyes. His father was surrounded by a makeshift family he had only just met.\u201cYou can cry,\u201d Mr. Davidson urged.Mr. Gul offered a tissue. Ms. Moini touched his shoulder. Ms. Betsalel showed him photos of his son on her iPhone.The father broke through his sobs with a polite smile.An article on Aug. 15 about a Facebook friendship that ended up saving the life of an Afghan baby who received heart surgery through an Israeli charity, Save a Child\u2019s Heart, misstated part of the name of a group led by Tony Laurance, who praised the outreach but criticized Israeli restrictions on medical care for Palestinians. The group is Medical Aid for Palestinians (not for Palestine). The article also overstated the impact of Israeli restrictions on travel and trade in the Gaza Strip, and overstated what is known about the financing of Save a Child\u2019s Heart. Although the restrictions have made the import of some medical equipment difficult, the import of medicine is not restricted. According to the charity\u2019s director, Simon Fisher, it receives money from the governments of Israel, the European Union and the United States, as well as Christian ministries, Jewish congregations, public and private foundations and individuals worldwide, but he said he did not know whether most of the money was from private Jewish donors.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "From Syrian Rubble to German Concert Halls With a Piano, a Mission and Survivor\u2019s Guilt", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWIESBADEN, Germany \u2014 The pianist starts his show abruptly, with a wail. The words and music are Arabic, but the pain is clear in any language.\u201cHow, God?\u201d he sings, \u201cHow could God bring you this scourge?\u201dHe is performing for a German audience in a quiet German town with fairy-tale spires. But Aeham Ahmad is thinking of his pulverized, starving neighborhood in Syria, where a few years ago, before coming to Germany as a refugee, he embarked on a strange career by playing concerts in the rubble.He jumps up, bobs his head in an impish little bow, and says by way of introduction: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not a good piano player. I learned in Syria. It\u2019s not like Mozart and Bach, but this is the way we play it.\u201dOnstage, Mr. Ahmad flatters his listeners, reassures them, owns them. He tells of his flight from bombs, hunger and repression. He sings of minarets and church bells \u201ccalling for peace.\u201d He declares that \u201cterrorism has no religion,\u201d and that refugees come \u201cto build Germany,\u201d not to harm it.\u201cHistory will remember that Germany has taken in the Muslims,\u201d he declares, then leads them in a singalong of \u201cAll My Little Ducks,\u201d the German equivalent of \u201cMary Had a Little Lamb.\u201dHe leaves the hall, as usual, in a shower of hugs and selfies.But the next day in his tiny room in the town of Wiesbaden, he lacerates himself over the role he has honed so well: He is \u201cthe good refugee,\u201d making \u201cgood Germans\u201d feel good about themselves. He cannot help seeing a touch of minstrel show in his act. He imagines how he might look through German eyes: a charity case, a trained animal dancing for treats.\u201cHe\u2019s a refugee dog,\u201d he says in a singsong voice. \u201cThey play with him, and he\u2019s playing, and he\u2019s happy.\u201dBefore the Syrian catastrophe, Mr. Ahmad, a third-generation Palestinian refugee and the son of a blind violinist, was a piano teacher and music shop salesman. Now, his message of resilience, along with Germans\u2019 desire for a reassuring symbol, has made him Germany\u2019s most popular refugee.He sings, he plays and, sometimes, he smacks the piano in grief and rage.Mr. Ahmad is booked virtually every night, crisscrossing the country from stadiums to modest provincial bars. He has appeared in dozens of uplifting German news accounts and received a prestigious prize named for one of his idols, Beethoven. Christina Aguilera\u2019s film production company has been in touch.\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been taken out of reality,\u201d he says one day on a bullet train between venues.He grew up, he continues, hearing his father spin his life story into legend, \u201clike you tell stories about Sinbad the sailor.\u201d But even the true-life tale of a self-made, blind musician who learned to play the violin pales in comparison with his own fantastical voyage, from Syrian government siege and Islamist extremist rule through shipwreck and exile to uneasy celebrity.Onstage every night, he re-enacts that journey. And on every road trip in between, he re-examines it \u2014 rather mercilessly, like the self-doubting artist he has always been.\u201cI feel like a frog that\u2019s being dissected,\u201d he confesses, collapsing into a seat at the start of a four-train, five-hour trip to his next gig, which, as always, because of labor restrictions on refugees, he will play for free.\u201cI\u2019m selling myself,\u201d he says, \u201cand I\u2019m not even getting the money.\u201dWorse, he wonders if he is making any difference: \u201cThey clap for me, but the rest\u201d \u2014 back in Syria \u2014 \u201care still in prison, under siege, under bombs.\u201dHis own boys rebuke him: \u201cYou didn\u2019t send a plane to bring us.\u201dMr. Ahmad\u2019s life as the piano-playing refugee began three years ago when he parked his instrument on a street of destroyed buildings \u2014 walls collapsed, awnings askew \u2014 and began to sing.He lived in Yarmouk, a neighborhood on the outskirts of Damascus, the capital, that started as a refugee camp for Palestinians in the 1950s. Over the years, it grew into a bustling district of a half-million Palestinians and Syrians.But it was now gutted by the Syrian civil war. Government troops kept it cordoned off, pounding it with artillery and sometimes airstrikes. Insurgent groups vied for control. Lack of regular access to food and medicine was beginning to kill; some of the most vulnerable starved to death.His only audience was his neighbors, trapped with him. And his goal was almost painfully modest: to keep everyone from losing their minds.\u201cI want to give them a beautiful dream,\u201d he said back then, over a spotty internet link. \u201cTo change this black color at least into gray.\u201dSoon, videos of the performances spread online, first among Syrians, then more widely, a different kind of dispatch from a war so brutal that it had already left much of the world numb.Mr. Ahmad became a symbol of hope and defiance and began to embrace a larger mission: showing that there were human beings stuck in Yarmouk.\u201cEveryone is against the civilians,\u201d he said in a video chat.Eventually, his new fame would help him escape the siege \u2014 to join the emigrants he sang of. That helps drive his ambivalence and fuel a colossal case of survivor\u2019s guilt.It is also how, after years of online correspondence, my colleague Hwaida Saad and I find ourselves on the main square of Wiesbaden on a late spring afternoon, meeting Mr. Ahmad in person for the first time.It is clear how much he has already changed. He wheels his bike confidently up to the cafe, birdlike and sprightly in a striped shirt and skinny jeans, and wolfs down an \u00e9clair. He has learned some staccato English. When his phone rings, which it does constantly, he adopts the brisk, businesslike tone of a performer too busy for all of his fans.\u201cI talk to a million people on the phone,\u201d he tells a caller. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, which one is your concert?\u201dThe very first thing he tells us is that he does not want to sugarcoat the experience of exile, or to be anyone\u2019s poster child for Europe as a happy ending.\u201cThey see me as a star,\u201d he says. \u201cBut still, they look at us funny.\u201dHe says people often ask how it feels to play in Germany, and now, for once, he wants to give the honest answer: \u201cI feel nothing. I close my eyes, and all around me \u2014 I play and I remember Yarmouk.\u201dThe memory of war is everywhere in Wiesbaden. The dormitory where Mr. Ahmad shares a room with five other refugees is called the American Camp, for the troops it long housed after World War II. Every day, he wheels his bike past brass tiles bearing the names of deported Jews, embedded in sidewalks outside their onetime homes.Many of Mr. Ahmad\u2019s enthusiastic helpers here see aiding refugees as part of Germany\u2019s moral burden, atoning for its Nazi past. When the local newspaper reported that he needed someone to donate a piano, he was offered 30.Lately, she has been battling rules that have blocked Mr. Ahmad from being paid for performances, or even collecting the Beethoven prize honorarium of 10,000 euros, about $11,200. He has reached a stage in his asylum process that lets him work as, say, a wage laborer. But German rules, Ms. Gruhn says, seem not to envision a refugee artist or musician.So he subsists on the government\u2019s \u20ac300 monthly refugee stipend.But still, he keeps playing because that is not just what he does, but who he has become.That evening, as he rushes to yet another concert, he insists that he is not a great pianist, just good at marketing his story. He has invited other refugees to join him at concerts, to ease the minds of Germans who fear that every refugee might be a terrorist.\u201cPeople will see them sitting and listening to music,\u201d he explains. \u201cSweet people, following German rules.\u201dThe concert is a hit. But he cannot sleep afterward, and a day later, his mood darkens as he heads to his next show.At the train station, he learns the venue is five hours away, not two, as he was told. Too many patrons are booking too many shows, not coordinating, not considering his exhaustion. Germans, he says, would never subject themselves to such a schedule.\u201cJust say no,\u201d Ms. Gruhn has told him. But he cannot. He feels obligated. As the train zips through a storybook landscape \u2014 castle turrets, deep woods \u2014 he brings to mind an enchanted child, unable to stop dancing.Disembarking at G\u00fctersloh, an industrial town clear across the country, he sees a car hit a bicyclist, who falls with a thud.\u201cShe\u2019s going to die,\u201d he says. \u201cI know the sound. Just look at it, the blood. She will die for sure.\u201dBut there is no blood. The paramedics think the cyclist will be all right.Is Mr. Ahmad reliving Yarmouk?It was a shock to Palestinians raised on the Syrian government\u2019s claim to be their champion. For Mr. Ahmad, it was the start of \u201ca second Nakba,\u201d or disaster, the Palestinians\u2019 name for their displacement in 1948. To him, Yarmouk was a substitute homeland. But his father, born in southern Syria after his parents were driven from their home in the Galilee, had always told him different.\u201cHe told me music is our country,\u201d Mr. Ahmad tells us. \u201cAnd now I\u2019m noticing this is true.\u201dMr. Ahmad\u2019s parents, like him, were rescued by music.His father, Ibrahim, lost his sight at 8. He was sent to a school for the blind in Damascus, bound for a life of weaving wicker chairs. But he lied, telling his father that he needed a violin or he would be kicked out of school.He learned to play Arabic classics and opened a music shop in Yarmouk. Later, in the Old City of Damascus, a young Syrian woman named Iman, whose conservative father did not want her studying music, sneaked to Ibrahim\u2019s shop and asked for accordion lessons. Romance ensued, but her father rejected her blind suitor: \u201cYou want to be a servant?\u201dSo Iman, pretending her accordion needed repairs, took her mother to the shop. Ibrahim played, Iman\u2019s mother sang. A few years later, Aeham Ahmad was born.He worked hard but lacked the grades, and the connections, for a concert career, so he studied music education and worked in the shop. Still, he played with a driven energy.\u201cI always feel I\u2019m not good enough,\u201d Mr. Ahmad says. \u201cI was like this before, and the war made it worse: I play every day to fix something that is screwed up in me.\u201dOne day, Mr. Ahmad noticed a young woman in glasses lingering at the window. Mortified, he pretended to be on the phone. Later, she walked in with shawarma sandwiches.\u201cFor me and you,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to eat.\u201dIt was a bold move in their traditional neighborhood. But Mr. Ahmad liked that. He felt even luckier after war broke out. His wife gave birth twice while their town was under siege, and she supported him when playing music became risky.\u201cI thank God,\u201d he says, \u201cfor having a strong woman.\u201dWhen protests against President Bashar al-Assad of Syria began in 2011, he says, he watched with interest but did not join. He was reluctant to embrace a cause or identity beyond music, \u201cmy own personal revolution.\u201dSecurity forces fired on protesters; armed rebellion gathered steam. Yarmouk stayed neutral at first, as Palestinian leaders urged. But Syria\u2019s relatively good treatment of Palestinians gave them a stake in the country, and like Syrians, they were divided. Many joined the rebellion.Mr. Ahmad did not try to leave; he was wanted for military service. To feed the family, he spent its savings. Then an uncle set his pigeons free and fled himself, leaving the birds\u2019 feed, a mountain of lentils. Mr. Ahmad opened a falafel stand. Falafel should be made of chickpeas, but people were hungry.One day, a shell landed near his stand, killing three customers. Shrapnel hit Mr. Ahmad\u2019s hand. He started playing piano more, to rehabilitate his fingers. That gave him an idea. The lentils were running out, but music never would.He found seven friends sharing a water pipe (tobacco was scarce). One, Mahmoud Tamim, liked to write songs mocking Mr. Assad; Mr. Ahmad asked him to write one about Yarmouk. They became the first Yarmouk Guys, Shebab al-Yarmouk.For their debut, they pushed the piano to the rubble from the first airstrike and sang the new song, \u201cYarmouk Is Missing You.\u201d It remains their biggest hit.The project felt pure back then, but as their fame grew, some singers asked for pay. Next, activists started selling photographs to media outlets.Even Mr. Ahmad saw opportunities.\u201cAlways, there is the ego,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThey made money off me, but without these photos, I am not famous.\u201dThe attention made it harder to fend off warlords. A pro-Assad Palestinian faction demanded that he remove a line about Yarmouk\u2019s being \u201csurrounded by cannons,\u201d since the obvious culprit was the government.Then came hard-line Islamists. They objected first to mixed-gender concerts, later to music in general.\u201cIf the Prophet Muhammad were here, they would call him an infidel if he disagreed with them \u2014 it\u2019s about \u2018agree and obey,\u2019\u201d Mr. Ahmad complained at the time in a video chat. \u201cCan they stop the birds from singing?\u201dHe stopped playing in public. He hid his electronic keyboard in a duffel bag and climbed to rooftops to play, watching out for government snipers.Still, he felt unsafe. Members of his band were being abducted: Mr. Tamim by security forces, others by Islamist fighters. One day, a gunman set his piano on fire.Finally, Mr. Ahmad cashed in. A German journalist sent enough money to get him and his family out of Yarmouk.Halfway to Turkey, security forces stopped them and threw them in jail, the children included. They got out a week later, but, shaken, they decided that his wife and their children would wait in Syria; because relatives are still in danger, we are not disclosing their names. Mr. Ahmad went on alone.For a while, he was just another refugee. He faded into the masses fleeing then, in August 2015, as the exodus to Europe grew.Paying smugglers, he crossed mountains, dodging checkpoints and border guards.Now, he was traveling openly as the Piano Man of Yarmouk.Mr. Ahmad bounced from camp to camp, but practically everywhere, he found helpers who knew his story.German liberals spreading a message of inclusion seized on Mr. Ahmad, \u201cas if,\u201d he joked, \u201cI\u2019m the only refugee around.\u201dAudiences and journalists skewed his story to fit European fears, he says, emphasizing Islamist extremists but playing down the government siege.But he could hardly complain, counting on the attention to speed the paperwork to bring his family to Germany \u2014 and maybe even smooth others\u2019 path to integration.\u201cI failed to change anything in Syria,\u201d he reasoned, \u201cbut here I might have a chance.\u201dBy the time we visit, Mr. Ahmad is used to the contrasts of life in this wealthy German town. Outside his dormitory, spacious houses are draped with lilacs and rhododendrons, and a poster advertises a \u20ac50 reward for a lost teddy bear.Rarely alone, he is lonely. He walks head down, video chatting with his wife and boys. He bounces between his dorm room and fancy hotels paid for by concert organizers. He has met the German chancellor, Angela Merkel.Television news amps up fear of refugees and reports occasional attacks on migrants. But Mr. Ahmad insists that no German has ever threatened him.And so, he keeps playing, trying to change German minds \u2014 and fight stereotypes.A day after the Wiesbaden concert, Mr. Ahmad plays for a high school class.The students listen, rapt, then ask questions that rankle.\u201cIf you were still in Syria, would you be fighting for ISIS?\u201d\u201cHow could you learn piano in Syria?\u201dHe answers gamely: He is against all violence; Syrians are the Islamic State\u2019s main victims; prewar Syria was troubled, not destitute; his family owned several houses and pianos.\u201cHow has your integration been?\u201d someone asks.\u201cPerfect,\u201d he says.Just once we see him lose his temper: a wealthy concert host demands \u20ac2 change from a \u20ac200 train ticket. \u201cEveryone is promoting themselves,\u201d Mr. Ahmad splutters later.Still he wonders onstage: \u201cAre they feeling the music I\u2019m feeling? Or do they just feel pity because I\u2019m a refugee?\u201dGermans, he tells an audience in Wiesbaden, often ask if he has heard of Mozart. He pauses a beat, then charges into a high-speed medley: Mozart\u2019s Rondo Alla Turca intercut with Beethoven\u2019s \u201cF\u00fcr Elise.\u201dHe slows down, speeds up, flashes a grin, then swipes a hand up and down the keyboard like Little Richard, or Liberace. The crowd laughs, clapping in time. It is a musical joke, a jab at racist assumptions. And they are in on it.Reporting was contributed by Hwaida Saad from Wiesbaden, G\u00fctersloh and Karlsruhe, Germany, and Beirut, Lebanon; Mohammad Ghannam from Beirut; Maher Samaan from Paris; and Katarina Johanssen from Berlin.videoAdvertisement"}

Fashion is an industry continually redefined by trends \u2014 inspiration is the oxygen, while creativity is the heartbeat. That inspiration can be found on social media\u2019s open forums, where bold, creative people show off what they\u2019re wearing and how they're wearing it, prompting rivals, fans and imitators to respond in kind. Check your Instagram, Facebook feed and favorite fashion blog: The results are a visual feast of originality. In Japan \u2014 a country known for avant-garde designers, progressive street style and a seemingly nationwide talent for subverting and initiating trends \u2014 there\u2019s a popular fashion app filled with enough content to satisfy a style-inspiration binge. This app has the captivating here\u2019s-what-the-cool-kids-are-wearing feel of a designer lookbook, as well as the friendly vibes of a family photo album. And the best news? It just arrived in the U.S.It\u2019s called Wear (now available for iOS and Android) and, every day, members of the app\u2019s community of 7 million active users upload more than 7,000 images of themselves dressed according to a daily hashtag (#widelegpants or #whitedenim, for example). They also tag the photos to show the designers represented in their outifts. Yusaku Maezawa, a Tokyo-based billionaire who recently added a $57 million painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat to his already formidable collection of contemporary art, launched the app about three years ago. Maezawa got his start running a modest mail-order business in the 1990s that eventually became the e-commerce giant Zozotown. When Maezawa decided to expand into fashion, he hoped to create an app that\u2019s a democratic setting for users to conduct personal style experiments and share them with a community of like-minded innovators. \u201cIt\u2019s an expression of the poster\u2019s individuality through the designers and brands they choose and how their style is assembled,\u201d says Masahiro Ito, CEO of engineering for Start Today, the parent company of Wear and Zozotown. \u201cIt speaks to who they are, while at the same time creating something that resonates with others. Fashion always has an aspirational aspect to it, and Wear can be a great source for finding new inspiration.\u201dThe \u201cBack to Cool\u201d theme for this month\u2019s set of T\u00a0Brand Studio hashtags invites users to curate outfits that work for late summer into fall, when days are still warm but evening temperatures can dip. Blogger Lindsay Marcella (read more about her in the Wear It\u2019s At profile) says her strategy for transitional season dressing involves mixing cool-off pieces like blouses with cutout-back blouses and strappy sandals with cool-weather elements like denim and chunky sweaters. Fellow blogger Denny Balmaceda, also profiled, relies on jackets and a collection of 25 hats to layer up and down.

But you\u2019re the Uber expert. What do you think?Yeah, the report looks bad on its face if you\u2019re focused on the losses, which are really enormous. I can\u2019t see any public company getting away with this sort of spending without its investors freaking out. I\u2019m sure it is even making the private investors involved nervous, which is why this information leaked in the first place.One other thing: Its rival Lyft keeps spending cash to subsidize rides in American cities where it wants to gain market share. That\u2019s another reason Uber has to turn on the cash subsidy spigot every once in a while, just to tamp down any gains Lyft makes.

{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Support Among Republican Women Starts to Slide", "Date": "2016-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOf all the tribulations facing Donald J. Trump, perhaps none is stirring as much anxiety inside his campaign as the precipitous decline of support from Republican women, an electoral cornerstone for the party\u2019s past nominees that is starting to crumble.In a striking series of defections, high-profile Republican women are abandoning decades of party loyalty and vowing to oppose Mr. Trump, calling him emotionally unfit for the presidency and a menace to national security.\u201cFor people like me, who are Republican but reasonable and still have our brains attached, it\u2019s hard to see Trump as a reasonable, sane Republican,\u201d said Dina Vela, a project manager in San Antonio who said she had always voted Republican and remained wary of Hillary Clinton. But to her own surprise, she has started visiting Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign website and plans to vote for her.Since the two parties held their nominating conventions, Mr. Trump\u2019s lead over Mrs. Clinton with Republican women voters has declined by 13 percentage points, according to polls conducted by The New York Times and CBS News.In late July, 72 percent of Republican women said they would vote for Mr. Trump, a healthy majority, but far below the level won by the past three Republican presidential nominees. In 2012, Mitt Romney won 93 percent of Republican women. In 2008, John McCain won 89 percent, and four years earlier, George W. Bush won 93 percent.Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, said that Mr. Trump\u2019s divisive and combative tactics, which seem to have intensified since he secured the Republican nomination, were amplified in the eyes and ears of the nation\u2019s female voters.\u201cThat kind of rhetoric is inflammatory, and I think we are seeing that women in particular have a real problem with it,\u201d Ms. Walsh said.Alarm over Mr. Trump\u2019s temperament crosses demographic lines. But decades of social science research about gender and politics suggests that women have a unique perspective on government and its leaders that frequently diverges from men\u2019s \u2014 a view, Ms. Walsh said, grounded in their longer life expectancy, their lower pay and their expectation that government will play a meaningful role in their lives.This dynamic, she said, is reflected in the number of women who vote. Four years ago, about 10 million more women voted than men, the Rutgers center found.For Mrs. Clinton, the alienation of Republican women from Mr. Trump creates a rare opportunity to capture a coveted demographic. But it poses a dilemma as well.Skeptical liberals are already looking for signs of betrayal from Mrs. Clinton, making it dangerous for her to make overt or ideological appeals to Republican women. Instead, she is making her case to them by emphasizing kitchen-table issues like job creation and by raising doubts about Mr. Trump\u2019s temperament.Tellingly, her campaign recently released a commercial in eight swing states aimed at mothers. The ad, which featured cross-legged children watching Mr. Trump\u2019s most controversial statements on their home televisions, ominously asked: \u201cOur children are watching. What example will we set for them?\u201dDemocrats acknowledge that, in the end, Mr. Trump may repel Republican women as much as Mrs. Clinton attracts them.\u201cI really think it\u2019s fueled by an anti-Trump vote,\u201d said Tracy Sefl, a Democratic strategist. \u201cBut that\u2019s fine with me, and I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s fine with the campaign.\u201dBut not all those fleeing Mr. Trump are ready to embrace Mrs. Clinton. In interviews, several Republican women, and those who lean Republican, sounded anguished by their choice: frightened by Mr. Trump, but still uncomfortable with Mrs. Clinton.\u201cI just don\u2019t trust him,\u201d said Laura Schrock, a Delaware resident who said she had voted Republican in the last two presidential elections. A Clinton skeptic, she is prepared to vote for Gary Johnson, who is running as a Libertarian.Republican pollsters have long relied on a simple benchmark for their presidential candidates: They must win at least 90 percent of Republicans to capture the White House. But with some polls showing Mr. Trump struggling to attract even 75 percent of Republican women, that could prove an impossible task.\u201cIt\u2019s an unusually poor showing,\u201d said Whit Ayres, a pollster who worked for Marco Rubio\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cThere are not enough men to counterbalance it.\u201d\u201cWhat Trump is doing has never been done before: He is losing college-educated white women,\u201d said Stuart Stevens, Mr. Romney\u2019s chief strategist in 2012 and a critic of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.The danger for Mr. Trump is that the erosion could accelerate as leading Republican women publicly break with him, making an argument that the national interest must supersede party loyalty.\u201cWe\u2019re Republicans, she\u2019s a Democrat, but the policy disagreements we have are far outweighed by the danger that Donald Trump poses to America,\u201d said Jennifer Pierotti Lim, a lifelong Republican and an executive at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce who has pledged her support to Mrs. Clinton and spoke at the Democratic National Convention.\u201cThis Republican is with her, too \u2014 thank you, as always, for your leadership, Meg!\u201d a woman named Wendy Jones wrote on Ms. Whitman\u2019s Facebook page.Of course, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign rallies still teem with women, and plenty of female Republicans remain devoted to his candidacy, convinced that his presidency would improve their lives and baffled by the defections of party leaders.Elizabeth Gonzalez, a Trump supporter who lives in North Carolina, questioned the motives of the Republican women who are now speaking out against him.\u201cThey probably feel threatened because he\u2019s an outsider,\u201d she said.An article on Wednesday about the erosion of support among Republican women for Donald J. Trump misidentified a Republican voter who said she did not trust the Republican nominee but would not vote for Hillary Clinton either. The comment was made by Laura Schrock of Delaware, not by Carol Hillenbrand of New York. (Ms. Hillenbrand, a Republican, says she will support Mrs. Clinton.)Nick Corasaniti and Megan Thee-Brenan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Apple\u2019s new suite of operating systems appears to replace its pistol emoji, which was an image of a six-shooter, with a squirt gun.Apple\u2019s change is ill considered because it breaks the conceptual compatibility that Unicode is meant to establish. Anyone with an iPhone ought to be able to send a message to someone with another company\u2019s products \u2014 like Google or Microsoft or Samsung \u2014 and have what\u2019s delivered communicate the same idea as what\u2019s sent. But with this change, a squirt gun sent from an iPhone will turn into a handgun when received by an Android device, and vice versa.Those behind the campaign to remove the gun from the phone do not appear to be relying on arguments about kids\u2019, or everyone else\u2019s, malleability. Rather, they have portrayed it as a traditional grass-roots messaging campaign: \u201cBy removing the gun emoji,\u201d they write, \u201cwe\u2019ll show America wants stricter access to real guns.\u201d Apple is surely free to favor gun control as a matter of corporate policy \u2014 but it should not be tinkering with our right to express either that or a contrary view on worldwide platforms.It need not be this way. Rather, our devices already enable tech-savvy individuals to invent new emoji-like graphics to send their friends \u2014 and that their friends in turn can pass on to others. Those that attain extensive use could then be standardized in a routine way through Unicode and made available to everyone.Apple, Microsoft, Google and other \u201cbig tech\u201d companies should not be placed in a position, which they themselves do not want, of having to decide which words or emojis do and don\u2019t represent their brand.

{"Headline": "Sole Russian Track and Field Athlete Cleared for Rio", "Date": "2016-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 An appeals court ruled early Monday morning that the Russian long jumper Darya Klishina should be allowed to compete in the Rio Games, overturning an 11th-hour decision by track and field\u2019s world governing body.Klishina will be the lone track and field athlete representing Russia in the Olympics. The track body, the International Association of Athletics Federations, has barred the rest of the team in the wake of revelations of an elaborate, state-sponsored doping program in Russia.Three days before the long-jump event for which she was registered, Klishina\u2019s participation was threatened. She was barred from the Games on Saturday after an investigation found that a past urine sample of hers had suspicious scratches on the bottle and contained DNA from two people, suggesting it had been tampered with.Klishina, 25, promptly appealed to world sports\u2019 arbitration court. The court ruled in her favor early Monday, after a four-hour hearing at an oceanside hotel here and numerous hours of deliberation.Russia has a history of success across disciplines at the Summer Games, but track and field is a centerpiece of its sports program, typically delivering the nation\u2019s largest count of medals.Klishina, due to compete on Tuesday in her first Olympics, had expressed frustration at the I.A.A.F. decision on Saturday and insisted she had not doped.Her lawyer, Paul J. Greene, argued before the sports court that the evidence was circumstantial and that Klishina had been denied basic due process by not being able to see it, analyze it and challenge it before the sports authorities rejected her.Officials pointed to revelations that drug violations had been routinely covered up by Russian antidoping authorities, who investigators said broke into supposedly tamper-proof bottles \u2014 leaving microscopic scratch marks \u2014 and swapped out the steroid-laced urine of Russian athletes, sometimes substituting in the clean urine of different people.Klishina \u2014 who has trained outside Russia, in Florida, for the last three years \u2014 was the only Russian athlete cleared to compete by the track organization and the International Olympic Committee. Nearly 70 other applications were rejected.But in recent weeks, a continuing investigation into Russian doping commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency raised questions about Klishina\u2019s drug-test history, suggesting that a urine sample of hers had been tampered with. That sample was taken during the last two years, the court said.Asked what the presence of two DNA profiles in one sample signified, Richard Budgett, the medical and scientific director of the International Olympic Committee, said on Monday, \u201cYou do not expect to find two people\u2019s urine in the same sample bottle.\u201dHe added, \u201cThat would be a case of manipulation.\u201dGreene, Klishina\u2019s lawyer, said her case had partly asserted that the I.A.A.F. did not have the authority to revisit its final decision. It also pointed to her years in the United States, where she was subject to drug tests.\"At this moment,\u201d Klishina wrote on Facebook on Saturday, after she had arrived in Rio, \u201cI cannot help but feel betrayed by a system that is not focused on keeping the sport clean and supporting rank-and-file athletes, but rather seeking victories outside sport arenas.\u201dThe International Olympic Committee expressed support for the supreme authority of the sports court on Monday. \u201cWe totally respect the decision,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cWe have to respect the decision.\u201dKlishina is set to compete on Tuesday, with a final competition for long jump set to take place on Wednesday.An earlier version of this article misstated the ruling by the arbitration court. As the article correctly noted elsewhere, the court overturned the decision, it did not uphold it.slide showAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "University of Chicago Strikes Back Against Campus Political Correctness", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "Supported byThe anodyne welcome letter to incoming freshmen is a college staple, but this week the University of Chicago took a different approach: It sent new students a blunt statement opposing some hallmarks of campus political correctness, drawing thousands of impassioned responses, for and against, as it caromed around cyberspace.\u201cOur commitment to academic freedom means that we do not support so-called trigger warnings, we do not cancel invited speakers because their topics might prove controversial, and we do not condone the creation of intellectual \u2018safe spaces\u2019 where individuals can retreat from ideas and perspectives at odds with their own,\u201d John Ellison, dean of students, wrote to members of the class of 2020, who will arrive next month.The Chicago letter echoed policies that were already in place there and at a number of other universities calling for \u201cthe freedom to espouse and explore a wide range of ideas.\u201d But its stark wording, coming from one of the nation\u2019s leading universities, and in a routine correspondence that usually contains nothing more contentious than a dining hall schedule, felt to people on all sides like a statement.Other universities have made similar statements, but the message from Chicago is \u201cclearer and more direct than I\u2019ve seen,\u201d said Greg Lukianoff, president of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a leading critic of what it says are destructive speech restrictions at many campuses. \u201cSending a letter to freshmen is different than I\u2019ve seen, at least in a long time, and certainly from a major university.\u201dMichael S. Roth, president of Wesleyan University, said the Chicago letter was, at least in part, a publicity stunt \u2014 \u201cGosh, is there any doubt?\u201d he asked \u2014 and a way of \u201cnot coddling students, but coddling donors.\u201dJeremy Manier, a University of Chicago spokesman, insisted there were no hidden motives behind the letter. And he said professors remained free, at their discretion, to use trigger warnings, the messages sometimes posted atop campus publications, assignments and other material, noting that they might be upsetting for people who have had traumatic experiences.But while conservatives often frame campus free speech as a left-versus-right issue, the dispute is often within the left.\u201cHistorically, the left has been much more protective of academic freedom than the right, particularly in the university context,\u201d said Geoffrey R. Stone, a University of Chicago law professor who specializes in free speech issues. Conservatives \u201csuddenly became the champions of free speech, which I find is a bit ironic, but the left is divided.\u201dMr. Lukianoff said he and his group are often mistakenly called conservative, adding, \u201cI\u2019m a former A.C.L.U. person who worked in refugee camps.\u201dThe dispute over free speech has ricocheted off campuses and around the country. In a commencement speech this year at Howard University, President Obama said: \u201cDon\u2019t try to shut folks out, don\u2019t try to shut them down, no matter how much you might disagree with them. There\u2019s been a trend around the country of trying to get colleges to disinvite speakers with a different point of view, or disrupt a politician\u2019s rally. Don\u2019t do that \u2014 no matter how ridiculous or offensive you might find the things that come out of their mouths.\u201dMr. Obama taught constitutional law at the university law school.The university said Friday that Dean Ellision and the university president, Robert R. Zimmer, were not available to discuss the letter or what prompted it, but Mr. Manier referred queries to Professor Stone, a former university provost.\u201cWe didn\u2019t feel we were doing something, internal to the University of Chicago, that was in any way radical or different,\u201d Professor Stone said Friday. It is clear that some colleges are retreating from the same free speech values, he said, \u201cbut my guess, if you asked most of these institutions 10 or 20 years ago, they would have said more or less what we said in our statement.\u201dSince Professor Stone\u2019s committee produced its report, several other universities, including Princeton, Purdue, Columbia and the University of Wisconsin system, have adopted similar policies or statements, some of them taken almost verbatim from the report. And this week\u2019s letter to University of Chicago freshmen draws from that and specifically cites the report as embodying the university\u2019s point of view.Many academics say the concerns reflected in the University of Chicago letter, while real, are overblown. \u201cI asked faculty if any had ever been asked to give trigger warnings,\u201d said Dr. Roth, of Wesleyan. \u201cI think one person said they had.\u201dBut when asked specifically about \u201cslurs and other language on campus that is intentionally offensive to certain groups,\u201d 69 percent of college students said that colleges should be allowed to impose restrictions on such expression.Eric Holmberg, the student body president at the University of Chicago, said the letter suggested that administrators \u201cdon\u2019t understand what a trigger warning is,\u201d and seemed \u201cbased on this false narrative of coddled millennials.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an effort to frame any sort of activism on campus as anti-free-speech, just young people who are upset,\u201d Mr. Holmberg said, \u201cwhen in reality I\u2019d say the administration is far more fearful of challenge than any student I know.\u201dChristopher Mele and Megan Thee-Brenan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The international system undergirding global peace will become weaker.Obama did not in fact say in the Rose Garden three years ago that he had rejected force; he urged Congress to get behind it. With time these events have blurred to make him \u201cvery proud of this moment.\u201dNo outcome in Syria could be worse than the current one.

They were the catalysts for Facebook\u2019s partnership to build classroom software with Summit Public Schools.Facebook is out to upend the traditional student-teacher relationship.Rather than have teachers hand out class assignments, the Facebook-Summit learning management system puts students in charge of selecting their projects and setting their pace. The idea is to encourage students to develop skills, like resourcefulness and time management, that might help them succeed in college.\u201cAs parents and kids and teachers get access to this type of learning, I think more and more will want it,\u201d Diane Tavenner, the co-founder and chief executive of Summit Public Schools, said in a telephone interview.But the Summit-Facebook system, called the \u201cSummit Personalized Learning Platform,\u201d is different.The software gives students a full view of their academic responsibilities for the year in each class and breaks them down into customizable lesson modules they can tackle at their own pace. A student working on a science assignment, for example, may choose to create a project using video, text or audio files. Students may also work asynchronously, tackling different sections of the year\u2019s work at the same time.The system inverts the traditional teacher-led classroom hierarchy, requiring schools to provide intensive one-on-one mentoring and coaching to help each student adapt.This summer, more than 1,500 educators and leaders of public, private and charter schools participating in the program, called Summit Basecamp, attended sessions to learn how to use the system. Among the 19 schools that introduced the new learning approach last year, at least a few educators and administrators reported a steep learning curve.\u201cThere were many points where we weren\u2019t sure the Summit Basecamp model was what our students needed,\u201d said Claire Fisher, the principal of Urban Promise Academy, a public middle school in Oakland, Calif., which introduced the platform in its sixth-grade classes.By the end of the school year, however, 31 percent of the school\u2019s sixth graders were reading at or above their grade level, compared with just 9 percent in the fall. That was a larger improvement in reading than students in seventh and eighth grades, which did not use the platform, Ms. Fisher said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fed, Eager to Show It\u2019s Listening, Welcomes Protesters", "Date": "2016-08-24", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When a dozen protesters in green T-shirts showed up two years ago at the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., they were regarded by many participants as an amusing addition.Two years later, they have won a place on the schedule.The protesters, who want the Fed to extend its economic stimulus campaign, are scheduled to meet on Thursday with eight members of the central bank\u2019s policy-making committee. At the start of a conference devoted to esoteric debates about monetary policy, officials will hear from people struggling to make ends meet.The Fed\u2019s effort to show that it is listening to its critics reflects the central bank\u2019s broader struggle to find its footing in an era whose great challenge is not the strength of inflation, but the weakness of economic growth.\u201cWe want to make sure that regular voices are being heard,\u201d Mr. Barkan said in beginning the campaign two years ago. The American economy, he said, was not working for all Americans \u2014 particularly not for blacks and other minority groups.Fed officials so far have chosen to accommodate the group by applauding its efforts at public education, not by seriously engaging its arguments that interest rates should be raised more slowly. Esther George, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, which hosts the Jackson Hole conference, arranged Thursday\u2019s meeting with the activists. She said in an interview earlier this year that the Fed must balance job growth with other issues, like financial stability.\u201cI am completely sympathetic,\u201d she said of the group\u2019s concerns.But she cautioned that the Fed\u2019s powers were limited. Pushing too hard to lower unemployment could lead to higher inflation, or speculative bubbles, that would force the Fed to raise interest rates more quickly. The resulting economic volatility could end up doing more harm than good.\u201cThe Federal Reserve has become somehow the answer to many problems far beyond what we can actually address,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish I could fix all of it with a tool like monetary policy. But we can\u2019t.\u201dFed Up\u2019s more visible success has come in pursuit of a longer-term goal: advocating for changes in the Fed\u2019s governance that could eventually shift its decision-making.Moreover, the report said that whites composed 83 percent of the directors of the Fed\u2019s 12 regional reserve banks, who select the regional presidents.Narayana Kocherlakota, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said that the absence of minorities was \u201cquite troubling.\u201d\u201cThose kinds of persistent absences of key demographic groups really suggest that the appointment process, there is something that can be fixed there,\u201d he said.Fed Up also argued that bank executives should not sit on regional Fed boards. Under current law, bankers hold three of the nine seats on each board. The regional reserve banks are owned by the commercial banks in each district, although they operate under the authority of the Fed\u2019s board, a government agency whose members are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.On the same day, a spokesman for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign said in a statement that \u201cSecretary Clinton believes that the Fed needs to be more representative of America as a whole and that common sense reforms \u2014 like getting bankers off the boards of regional Federal Reserve Banks \u2014 are long overdue.\u201dTwo months later, the Democratic Party adopted a campaign platform that included similar language, the first time in recent decades it mentioned the Fed.\u201cHaving a diverse set of policy makers \u2014 including African-Americans and Hispanics \u2014 will influence the Fed\u2019s decision-making,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it should. The public should have confidence that the public is well represented at the F.O.M.C. table.\u201d\u201cEven if they move once less over the course of several years, that\u2019s still massive,\u201d he said earlier this year. \u201cThe number of people who have jobs because of that, or higher wages, that dwarves a $15-an-hour wage increase in a smaller city.\u201dLael Brainard, a Fed governor who plans to attend the Thursday meeting, made a point last year of visiting the parallel conference Mr. Barkan staged on the sidelines of the Fed event. And Mr. Barkan\u2019s group has now succeeded in persuading each of the regional reserve presidents to meet with groups of local workers.Neel Kashkari, the new president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, met with Fed Up\u2019s local affiliate, Neighborhoods Organizing for Change, this month, telling the group that he shared their concern about the persistence of higher rates of unemployment among blacks and other minority groups.Mr. Kashkari also accepted an invitation to spend a day with one of the group\u2019s members, Rosheeda Credit, a Minneapolis resident who described the struggles she and her boyfriend faced to cover the cost of rent and child care for their five children.\u201cWalking a day in somebody else\u2019s shoes is actually \u2014 it makes the anecdotes that much more real,\u201d Mr. Kashkari, who arrived at the bank in January, told reporters after the meeting. \u201cIt influences how I think about the problems we face.\u201dAdvertisement"}

So was the chief of security for the opening ceremony as he left Olympic Stadium. A police officer was killed when his vehicle was sprayed with gunfire, and an Olympics bus carrying journalists was attacked by people throwing rocks.Mindful of Rio\u2019s reputation for violent crime, the Brazilians have deployed 85,000 security personnel. This show of force includes 23,000 soldiers patrolling the city, some in military vehicles, along with helicopters and warships looming around the city\u2019s most popular beaches.\u201cThe city has never felt so safe,\u201d said Gilberto Dias, 50, a hot dog vendor who described how plainclothes officers had sprung to action one morning last week after two muggers accosted a tourist in the upscale Copacabana neighborhood. \u201cThey just materialized out of nowhere, which is something I\u2019ve never seen before.\u201dBut even before the Games began, Rio was facing a surge in lawlessness in recent months that had rattled residents and alarmed the authorities.With the economy in turmoil, assaults and robberies on the street jumped by 42 percent in May, with 10,000 robberies that month. And after years of declining homicides, the number of murders increased by more than 7 percent during the first half of the year, with over 1,500 people killed.\u201cThe assault on the American athlete is what happens to us in Rio every day,\u201d said Marcello Brito, 51, an architect, referring to Mr. Lochte.Rio\u2019s finances were so bad before the Games that it had declared a \u201cstate of calamity.\u201d Budgets had been gutted, with police officers and firefighters protesting delays in receiving pay by holding signs at the airport telling visitors, \u201cWelcome to hell.\u201dThe federal government responded with an $850 million bailout package to help the state of Rio de Janeiro stay afloat, pay salaries and keep essential services running during the Olympics.But the crisis in Rio\u2019s finances, which are heavily dependent on global oil prices, remains, and the security lapses threaten to undermine ambitions for a resurgence in the city\u2019s fortunes.Many residents have welcomed the increased security.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see soldiers patrolling the streets, at least where I live,\u201d said Cassius Almada, 39, a high school math teacher who lives in Copacabana. \u201cIt could be a lot worse.\u201dBut those living beyond the necklace of upscale seafront neighborhoods say the increased security has had little effect in communities that have long been troubled by violence.Maria do Ros\u00e1rio Silva Santos, 54, who was visiting Rio from Bras\u00edlia, the nation\u2019s capital, said she had been stunned to see young men \u2014 not police officers \u2014 toting guns casually in Acari, a working-class neighborhood in north Rio, where she was staying during the Games.\u201cIt was shocking to see,\u201d she said. \u201cAs far as I can tell, nothing has changed.\u201dJulita Lemgruber, the director of the Center for Studies on Public Security and Citizenship at Candido Mendes University in Rio, said it was na\u00efve to expect a drastic drop in crime during the Games.\u201cThe government thought a snap of their fingers would bring peace to a city that has lived through so much violence in the past few years,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t do any good to have this show of thousands of extra police unless you tell every Olympic athlete to walk the street with a policeman by his side.\u201d\u201cPolice forces are invading the favelas every day and killing people, which is outrageous,\u201d Ms. Lemgruber said. \u201cHow can anyone hope to bring peace by spreading violence?\u201dHeder Martins de Oliveira, the vice president of Brazil\u2019s National Association of Police Officers, said that the killing of the officer in Rio last week pointed to the risks that security forces faced daily in the city. Referring to the wave of armed assaults during the Games, he said, \u201cThe situation would be even worse, an international disgrace, if dedicated police weren\u2019t doing their job at this time.\u201d\u201cOf course, there\u2019s more attention to these episodes because they\u2019re taking place when the world is looking at Rio,\u201d Mr. Martins de Oliveira said. \u201cBut this is a dilemma that Rio faces on a daily basis.\u201dThe police have also been involved in violent episodes blemishing the Olympics. Over the weekend, an off-duty federal police official opened fire in the direction of a man he was brawling with at Rio Scenarium, a downtown nightclub. It was not clear whether anyone was seriously injured.Amid the surge in lawlessness, many residents have found a measure of solace on social media, where they commiserate about their experiences and document each episode of crime in hopes of spurring the authorities to action.Among dozens of Facebook groups focused on crime is \u201cWhere I was robbed,\u201d a user-generated map containing dots that form a road map of brutalization and despair.\u201cHello, hello, authorities!\u201d one Facebook user, Eliane Cattapan, wrote recently. \u201cWith the arrival of all the tourists, I\u2019m much more afraid of the rise in street crime than terrorism.\u201dPaula Moura and Vinod Sreeharsha contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro, and Tania Franco from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "When I walk in the evening with my camera from Kabuki-cho to Kuyakusho-dori and then along Okubo-dori toward Shin-Okubo Station, I sometimes feel a shiver running down my spine. I find myself flinching for some reason, even though nothing in particular has happened. Shadow-spirits squirm amid the darkness of the back streets, under the lights and neon signs. The sight line of the small camera in my hand picks up the sensitive reactions of these wraiths, like electrical impulses. As they perceive coarse tremors in the surrounding air, my cells quiver with tension. Wandering around, enveloped in the vaguely violent atmosphere, I persuade myself that it is my duty as a photographer to photograph Shinjuku without shrinking back. Why? Because no other seedy neighborhood is quite like the shambles of Shinjuku.When I watch the movie \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d I think of Shinjuku; and when I\u2019m in Shinjuku, I feel like I\u2019m in \u201cBlade Runner.\u201d Brightly colored blimps float in the sky, and skyscrapers tower behind them like phantoms. Acid rain falls constantly, and unidentifiable people throng through the nether regions. Shinjuku really resembles a replica of that onscreen futuristic city in an unknown country. Gotham City too, the fictional criminal conurbation that forms a backdrop to the film \u201cBatman,\u201d is so close to Kabuki-cho even in the details \u2014 time has been lost from each of these cities, and this conversely conjures up indefinable feelings of familiarity. In other words, although it is a conglomeration which has crushing concrete physicality, when observed from a short distance away Shinjuku is always a concocted city, wrapped in a \u201creality\u201d that is only virtual. It is rather like a hard-boiled novel, where the drier the text, the greater the lyrical and erotic emotions that exude from between the lines. In that sense, there is no other city that emits the alluring body warmth that Shinjuku does.I shot Osaka in 1997, and as soon as the photobook was complete I realized, \u201cNow at last I\u2019m ready for Shinjuku.\u201d\u00e2\u0080\u00a8 Osaka has its own unique fetors and contours. Having held it in my lens for a year, I felt an overwhelming certainty that the only place that was similar, equivalent or indeed had a dense substantiality capable of surpassing it was Shinjuku. My routine is to walk through the streets holding my camera, watching, and it was self-evident that the only fresh, raw territory left to me was neither Shibuya nor lkebukuro \u2014 and definitely not anywhere like Ginza, Ueno or Asakusa \u2014 but Shinjuku. For street photographers like me, those who stand on Tokyo\u2019s asphalt with camera in hand, it would be inconceivable to look elsewhere, to ignore Shinjuku as it presents itself to us, this Pandora\u2019s box full of modern myths.My relationship with Shinjuku goes back almost 40 years, but I still find it enigmatic. I may position myself there as an observer, but every time I do so, Shinjuku hides its true nature like a chimera and throws my mental perspective into confusion, as if I had strayed into a labyrinth. I certainly don\u2019t hate the place \u2014 yet if asked if I truly love it, I sense I\u2019d fall silent. Other areas, such as Ginza or Asakusa, can engender feelings of both love and hate \u2014 I can have a tepid relationship with them \u2014 but with Shinjuku there is no place for such vacillation: If anything, my obsession grows stronger.As I have been photographing Shinjuku these past two years, many have posed the question, \u201cWhy Shinjuku?\u201d Each time I answered on impulse, based on how I felt at that moment \u2014 although sometimes I sounded quite serious. In truth, however, it comes down to nothing more than \u201cbecause it was there.\u201d And because I still see Shinjuku as the great backwater, a formidable den of iniquity. The countless other neighborhoods that make up the huge metropolis of Tokyo sped through the gradual changes of the 50-plus years since the end of the war and, before our own eyes, have now been reduced to white, hygienic, sterile landscapes \u2026 but Shinjuku is still there in its primary colors, a living, writhing monster.When I touched upon Shinjuku once before in a book, all I could say was this: \u201cIt was not through my own volition that I came to love this neighborhood, that I became obsessed with it. Shinjuku is imbued with a mystifying narcotic essence, and took me hostage with no possibility of escape. It was a time when I had just come to the capital, and was wandering aimlessly. A time when I was soaked in alcohol every night. A time when I deliriously took photos in the nooks and crannies of every street. A time of political turmoil, just before the 1970 Anpo struggles against the U.S. Security Treaty. A time when I set up an independent gallery, CAMP, together with other young photographers. A time spent together with Shuji Terayama and fellow photographers Shomei Tomatsu, Takuma Nakahira and Masahisa Fukase. I\u2019m sure the bitter memories far outnumber the good ones, but either way, countless memories of Shinjuku are definitively superimposed on most of what I remember of the vivid, hot times I have spent as a photographer.\u201dLight and shade, obverse and reverse, truth and falsehood: Each accompanies the other. And just as blighted areas exist inside everyone\u2019s heart, cities also need places of evil. An elusive labyrinth, a modern Babylon, scabrous, smarting, yet soothing. The fact that I am spellbound to shoot Shinjuku surely shows that we are one and the same."}

At one point, she said she would kill the officers if they did not leave, the police said. An officer fired once at Ms. Gaines, and she fired back, the police said. Then officers fired three shots, killing Ms. Gaines. Her son also sustained injuries in the crossfire, though they are not considered to be life-threatening.But in the case of Ms. Gaines, according to the police, it may have escalated the encounter.While the standoff with Ms. Gaines continued, the police in Baltimore County submitted a request to Facebook \u2014 which owns Instagram \u2014 to deactivate but not delete her accounts. Facebook cooperated, temporarily making her Facebook and Instagram posts inaccessible during the standoff.\u201cIt\u2019s key for these trained negotiators to be able to interact with the subject without distraction, without interference from the outside,\u201d Elise Armacost, a Baltimore County police spokeswoman, said at a news conference. The episode highlights Facebook\u2019s increasingly complicated role in documenting violence, and in some cases, its active place in the middle of it.Before the shots were fired, the Instagram posts caught the police\u2019s attention.\u201cThe police,\u201d the boy responded.\u201cAnd what are they trying to do?\u201d she said.\u201cThey trying to kill us,\u201d he said.The police said some of the comments people left on the posts encouraged her to defy orders to surrender peacefully, complicating the negotiations.A team of Facebook moderators decides what violent content can remain but will take it down if it appears to glorify violence. Though the videos on Ms. Gaines\u2019s account were not live, one of the videos was taken down for violating Facebook\u2019s community standards related to threats of physical harm, the company said.The police were also serving an arrest warrant on her boyfriend, Kareem Courtney, 39, who the police said was wanted on an assault charge. He fled the apartment with a 1-year-old child but was arrested, the police said.After Ms. Gaines refused to allow the police to enter, an officer obtained a key, the police said. The officers found Ms. Gaines on the floor holding a shotgun and her son, the police said. They called for backup, and the standoff began.At a news conference on Tuesday, the police chief, James Johnson, said officers showed restraint throughout the standoff despite officers\u2019 being in danger.\u201cThe entire time, throughout the afternoon, she would repeatedly point the weapon at our personnel, and they maintained firearms discipline throughout,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

If deception were a sport, Trump would be the Olympic gold medalist; Clinton would be an honorable mention at her local Y.Let\u2019s investigate.Likewise, The Washington Post Fact-Checker has awarded its worst ranking, Four Pinocchios, to 16 percent of Clinton\u2019s statements that it checked and to 64 percent of Trump\u2019s.\u201cEssentially, Clinton is in the norm for a typical politician,\u201d says Glenn Kessler, who runs Fact-Checker, while Trump \u201cis just off the charts. There\u2019s never been anyone like him, at least in the six years I have been doing this.\u201dWhen I speak with Trump voters, they often argue that Clinton is an inveterate liar and crook, yet when pressed they draw from the same handful of examples.But it\u2019s also true that as the plane prepared to descend, security officials gave a spine-chilling briefing of the risks of sniper fire, and Clinton wore body armor in case of shooting.All this is junior varsity mendacity. In contrast, Trump is the champ of prevarication.If Clinton declares that she didn\u2019t chop down a cherry tree, that might mean that she actually used a chain saw to cut it down. Or that she ordered an aide to chop it down. As for Trump, he will insist, \u201cI absolutely did not chop down that cherry tree,\u201d even as he clutches the ax with which he chopped it down moments earlier on Facebook Live.In short, Clinton is about average for a politician in dissembling, while Trump is a world champion who is pathological in his dishonesty. Honestly, there is no comparison.Advertisement"}

Another is now living with the actor portraying the father. The stage manager took one, as did a hairdresser, and the parents of a publicist.\u201cI hadn\u2019t really discussed it with my husband, and we have a 6-year-old and an ancient Chihuahua, so it wasn\u2019t the best time,\u201d said Francesca Faridany, or Frankie, the actress who for the first year of the show\u2019s run played the teacher, Siobhan, and developed a fondness for Bubba, who was Puppy No. 8. \u201cBut I thought, \u2018Oh, my God, I want to take him.\u2019\u201d Bubba, a mixed-breed dog who arrived at the show from a shelter and stayed in the cast for about eight weeks because he remained small, now lives with Ms. Faridany and her family.This unusual puppy pipeline \u2014 generally from a breeder to the stage, and from the stage to a home \u2014 is nearing an end: The producers of \u201cCurious Incident\u201d have announced that they are closing the Broadway production on Sept. 4. But it has created an unusual group of dog-owning theater lovers who can identify their pets by number (reflecting when they appeared in the show), get together for playdates, exchange dog-sitting and have a Facebook group for photos; some even attended games played by the Curious Dogs, the show\u2019s Broadway Show League softball team.A few of the dogs had abbreviated theatrical careers (two exhibited stage fright and were replaced), while others had incidents (one vomited onstage). Bubba left after developing cherry eye, but then returned to reprise his role as an understudy. (On nights when Bubba performed but Ms. Faridany did not, the show sent a car to shuttle him to the theater.)At least two of the dogs have parlayed childhood success onstage into commercial work, while Puppy No. 12, Babs, seems to have an actor\u2019s self-regard. \u201cOne quirky thing she does is stare at herself \u2014 in any mirror, water, glass windows,\u201d said Sandy Rapp, the mother of a \u201cCurious\u201d publicist, who adopted that dog. \u201cWe attribute this to her having been a star.\u201dThe play, based on the best-selling 2003 novel by the British writer Mark Haddon, chronicles the quest by Christopher, a teenager with symptoms often associated with children on the autism spectrum, to solve a dog\u2019s murder. That dog, who appears onstage, dead, in the opening scene, is depicted by a prop that the live dogs are barred from seeing; the live puppy arrives late in the show.\u201cAnimals take you the way you are and ask for so little in return,\u201d said Allison Fedigan, whose husband is a production electrician on Broadway; the couple have a son on the autism spectrum, and adopted Puppy No. 10, Forrest, after hearing about the dogs from an electrician who worked on \u201cCurious Incident.\u201d \u201cFostering those relationships seems to be much easier for people on the spectrum.\u201dThe show, which began performances at Broadway\u2019s Ethel Barrymore Theater in September 2014, won the Tony Award for best new play last year; it has been playing in London since 2012, and touring productions begin next month in the United States and in January in Britain.Alex Sharp, who originated the role of Christopher (and won a Tony for his performance), decided while rehearsing for the Broadway opening that a puppy might respond to him better onstage if it knew him a bit, so he took the first puppy home. Mr. Sharp was not a dog person \u2014 his family moved constantly, and two rabbits were the extent of his childhood pet experience \u2014 so taking care of a puppy was a bit of a shock.\u201cLydia gave me a cage and puppy pads and food, and I was like, \u2018It\u2019s fine,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut it was running around throwing up on things, pooing, peeing, barking all night, running in circles hysterically excited, and sleeping for three hours.\u201dMr. Sharp worked with 13 puppies (\u201cthat was 13 heartbreaking moments when they would leave\u201d) and would take each home for a night or two when they first arrived at the show, and then later if their performances seemed to slacken. \u201cI would make a little bed next to mine and sleep with my hand on the puppy, and if my hand went off it would start crying,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was quite a lot, but it made a big difference to the performance onstage.\u201dOne puppy threw up during a scene \u2014 the actor playing Christopher\u2019s father used a sweatshirt to clean it up \u2014 and another nipped Mr. Sharp\u2019s face, forcing him to play the rest of the scene with his hoodie pressed against his chin to stop the bleeding. (Mary Birnbaum, a director who knew Ms. Faridany\u2019s husband, wound up adopting the biter, Puppy No. 6, who is a spaniel-poodle mix. \u201cHe was very poorly behaved in the show,\u201d she said, \u201cand one night he vomited onstage.\u201d But now, \u201cHe is wonderfully behaved and retains a bit of the actor\u2019s extroversion.\u201d)But mostly, Mr. Sharp said, the dogs were delightful \u2014 especially for audiences, and especially if the dog would yap or lick the actor\u2019s face. (\u201cThe secret was I\u2019d been sweating for hours, and they just liked the taste of the salt.\u201d) And the impact was clear.\u201cWhen the yellow lab tumbled out at the end of the show we both squealed and fell in love \u2014 along with everyone else in the audience, I\u2019m sure,\u201d said Hillary Reeves, who watched the show with her boyfriend. That couple adopted the opening-night puppy (No. 3, Jelly, a Labrador retriever) after hearing about the dog from a fellow alumna of Camp Broadway.Ms. DesRoche said that there had generally been a line of people in the theater world eager to adopt. \u201cIt\u2019s not difficult to find a home for an adorable blond puppy,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about adult pit bulls.\u201dChris Kurtz, a \u201cCurious\u201d deck electrician and video technician, introduced himself to Ms. DesRoche as soon as he heard that the dogs might be adoptable; he fostered Puppy No. 5, Charlie, for a week, commuting with him on the A train, before telling his thrilled kids that the dog would be coming home for good. Puppy No. 16, Lola, who loved the stage so much that she would jump into the gift box as soon as she heard her entrance music, went to Kim Shriver, who was working in the show\u2019s hair department when she met the dogs.Andrew Long, now playing Christopher\u2019s father, said: \u201cI have an 8-year-old daughter, and as soon as she got wind of the fact that they were being adopted when they got too big, it was just a battle of attrition \u2014 \u2018Can I have the next one?\u2019 I finally caved in the spring.\u201dOn the Tuesday of Simon\u2019s first performance, Ms. DesRoche brought him early to the theater to meet the cast; onstage, as most of the cast sat around the perimeter talking to acclimate him to the scene, Mr. Lea held a sort of dress rehearsal, using treats to lure the dog as he chased him around the stage, or lying on the floor and letting the dog crawl over his body.\u201cThe goal is having the dog come to me, and just being able to run around the stage and have it follow me around, but I change it up based on what the dog is doing \u2014 I have to read what the dog wants to do and work around that,\u201d Mr. Lea said. \u201cThe puppies do what puppies do.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "It was a bleak scene: Gulpari curled up against her mother, slumped against cushions on the wall. Zaher rubbed his stomach, muttering, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGod, God.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The room was so cloudy with smoke that we couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but get slightly high. We left feeling hollowed out and shaken. What could the future of those children be?I was there to write the story for my employer at the time, The Chicago Tribune. Paula was there to shoot it. (I am supposed to call her \u00e2\u0080\u009cMs. Bronstein,\u00e2\u0080\u009d for this is The New York Times, but she is a friend, and anyone who knows the force of nature that goes by Paula Bronstein would find such an honorific absurd.) After the article ran, I went on to the next story \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Afghanistan is like that. But I later found out that Paula had gone back to the family and tried to make sure they got into rehab. She took them food. She checked in on Zaher, especially, the boy who was already far gone by the time we met him, as he turnstiled his way through numerous stints in rehab.The scene is typical Paula, even as other journalists lose track of the stories we tell, of the people who share their innermost secrets. Or even as other journalists feel that journalism means dispassionate observation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just walk away,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Paula told me last month. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you document something, you have a responsibility to help. As journalists, we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hand people money. But when I was photographing the heroin addicts, I would bring them fruit. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d think, at least they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sell this. They can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t buy drugs. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something they can eat. I think it makes sense. At least in my world it does.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMuch as she did with Zaher, Paula has held onto Afghanistan ever since she first went there in December 2001. She kept going back, focusing primarily on photographing stories away from the war\u00e2\u0080\u0099s front lines. She showed how average Afghans coped with war, and how Afghan women confronted a variety of ills, how some teenage girls would rather set themselves on fire than be forced to marry old men, how women widowed by war coped.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI knew I had a unique body of work,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Paula, who did much of that work as a staff photographer for Getty Images and then as a freelancer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI knew I had something I felt was special, because it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just about embeds, it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just about the front lines. It was about the Afghans, living with the backdrop of war.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe book is divided into three basic sections: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Situation\u00e2\u0080\u009d (the euphemism everyone in Afghanistan seems to use to describe the state of the war), \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Casualties\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Reality.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Situation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Paula chronicles the training of the Afghan Army, Afghan Army casualties, the aftermath of suicide bombs, women voting and the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading politicians like former President Hamid Karzai. As always, there are surprises in Paula\u00e2\u0080\u0099s images \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the unexpected splashes of color, like the purple gloves on the NATO medic who is staring intently at something on the beige ground. (And yes, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the severed leg of a suicide bomber.)Looking through the photographs in \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Casualties\u00e2\u0080\u009d section is not easy. It is a grim, throat-choking march of doom that starts with a 7-year-old boy nearly killed in crossfire between United States troops and enemy forces and then moves through women injured by the tools of war and by their own hands and then children abandoned in a mental institution and a starving boy and his grief-stricken mother and then more grieving mothers. It is as relentless as Paula. It hurts to see children and women as throwaways, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part of the point. To make people who have never been in a war zone look at Afghans as human beings, not statistics in some United Nations report, and to try to imagine what it would be like if such things happened in the West. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe middle of the book is difficult to look at, no question about it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Paula, who grew up in a suburb of Boston and is now based in Thailand. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt has to be hard because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still hard today. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very current and very topical. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to show this. This is reality. This is reality.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe last section of the book is actually called \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Reality,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and it is, I guess, where the \u00e2\u0080\u009chope\u00e2\u0080\u009d part of the book\u00e2\u0080\u0099s title resides. Here, there are photographs of Afghans getting ready for a wedding, or women in bright blue burqas walking in front of a bombed-out palace, their reflections in a pool of water. Girls raise their hands in school. But this part of the book also includes the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heroin epidemic. (Paula is incapable of sugarcoating the reality in Afghanistan.) Zaher and Gulpari smoke with their mother on Page 152; men shoot up the drug inside the abandoned Russian Cultural Center, the building that became home to hundreds of drug addicts.One of the last images of the book is one I choose to hold on to. It shows an old man in a turban and a white beard laughing, standing in front of a hill in Kabul called \u00e2\u0080\u009cTV Mountain\u00e2\u0080\u009d because of all the television broadcast towers on top. It is beautiful, peaceful and joyous, and it makes me miss the Afghanistan that I once knew, when there was hope and defiance and, yes, laughter. It is not that way now, or so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m told. Paula last returned to Afghanistan in the spring, as the country struggled with what felt like ever-worsening security and the world seemed increasingly inclined to turn away. She obviously can no longer travel on the road we once traveled between Kabul and Kandahar. She can no longer travel by road to pretty much anywhere. There are stories she wants to do that she cannot. She could not follow the war widows of the battered Taliban stronghold Helmand Province to their homes to take photographs. She and a reporter opted not to drive to Kunduz Province to do a follow-up story on the Doctors Without Borders hospital mistakenly bombed by the Americans last year. We spoke the week after the Islamic State claimed responsibility for its first major suicide bombing in Kabul, an attack that killed at least 80 people at a peaceful demonstration. ISIS attacking inside Kabul instead of the Taliban? It seemed to be just another sign that the situation in the country was sliding from bad to worse.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Afghanistan of today,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThings are not going well. The bombing that just happened, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a bad sign of things to come. The world does want to forget about Afghanistan, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be able to anytime soon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

In her teens, she rose to the top of her sport in the U.S. By 22, she became the first American to win an Olympic gold medal in judo. Despite her accolades, the Middletown, Ohio, native hasn\u2019t been very visible in her home country because most judo matches aren\u2019t aired on TV in the U.S.But technology is quickly changing that: Judo is among the 41 sports of the summer games in Rio de Janeiro that people are able to watch anytime, anywhere, on almost any device. And while fans are watching judo matches, they\u2019ll be able to view Harrison\u2019s stats on sports apps like NBC Olympics and NBC Sports Live Extra.The summer games are the latest examples of how sports TV watching is going digital, completely transforming into an immersive viewing experience. Websites, apps and technologies like TV Everywhere \u2014 a term for the authenticated viewing of broadcast shows from channels people subscribe to on cable or satellite networks \u2014 enable fans to have a deeper, more engaged and interactive experience with sports.The new technologies also enable people to discover and become rabid fans of sports that they previously didn\u2019t have access to, like archery and canoeing. And that means they\u2019re interacting more with the athletes of those sports.Take judo, for instance. Since the sport\u2019s matches aired on multiple devices during the summer games in 2012, Harrison\u2019s fan base has grown. She now has over 15,000 Twitter followers and nearly 21,000 Instagram followers.\u201cThe greater visibility, more TV time and the more athletes who become household names, the better for the sport,\u201d Harrison said. This year, NBC will broadcast and/or live stream 6,755 hours of the summer games in Rio on desktops, smartphones, tablets and connected TVs. The game has changed for TV sports broadcasting. Previously, the network that pays for the rights to broadcast the summer games would bolster ratings by airing only the most popular events for each country.This year, for the second time in history, NBC will broadcast and/or stream 6,755 hours of live coverage of the summer games across desktops, smartphones, tablets and connected TVs. Sports fans can see all the events in the summer games, not just the popular ones.It\u2019s not just a win for TV watchers. It\u2019s a win for networks, too.The move to digital has boosted viewership. Overall, the summer games in London attracted 4 billion global viewers over 17 days. In the U.S., there were 219.4 million TV viewers \u2014 the most ever.Along the way, some sports achieved newfound popularity. At one point, an average of 1.5 million people were watching archery competitions on cable during daytime hours. That was larger than the audience that tuned in to any other sport that was aired on cable at that time, including basketball.The viewership gains show the potential for technologies like TV Everywhere apps, including WatchESPN. Those apps are fast approaching mainstream use. This authenticated TV viewing encourages people to keep their cable subscriptions by allowing them to stream the TV they already pay for.TV Everywhere is rapidly changing viewership habits and the way people consume content, according to a report by Adobe. In fact, TV Everywhere viewership has more than doubled in the past year, up by 107 percent year over year, according to the report, which was compiled by Adobe Digital Insights, the research arm of Adobe.\u201cTechnology has the power to connect consumers to the sports they love, yet many media companies are challenged with providing people with a personalized and engaging viewing experience across screens,\u201d said Campbell Foster, Adobe\u2019s director of product marketing. SMARTPHONE  PERSONAL COMPUTER  TV Connected Device  SMARTPHONE  PERSONAL COMPUTER  TV Connected Device The Adobe Digital Insights study found that 40% of US consumers are watching sports on mobile devices. Technology that makes it possible to watch sports content on multiple devices has created new sports fans. And if the fans are any indication, sports like judo will continue to grow in popularity.Sam Carter, a sales manager at Odyssey Marketing Group in Cheyenne, Wyoming, became a huge fan of judo because of the technology that\u2019s enabled him to watch judo matches. He's planning to watch the judo matches in Rio, too.\u201cI am guilty of creating a cult following at our business for Olympic judo,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the office in the break room, I would watch Olympic judo matches. Next thing I knew, they were hooked just like me.\u201dFans aren\u2019t the only ones taking notice of the newfound celebrity of athletes in up-and-coming events, such as weightlifting and trampoline. Marketers should be, too, experts say.Since many people will be watching from their mobile phones or tablets, with some simultaneously watching TV, marketing experts say it gives companies a big opportunity to do some creative marketing.To be sure, the trend toward viewing sports events across multiple screens makes it more complex for companies to find effective ways to reach customers. As a result, some companies will need to use multi-platform marketing strategies to target them.It\u2019s essential that marketers consider this because people aren\u2019t just watching on their set-top boxes anymore. In fact, the Adobe Digital Insights study found that 40 percent of U.S. consumers are watching sports on mobile devices. With the advent of apps and technology, there are companies that could create some serious buzz.\u201d Technology that makes it possible to watch the summer games on multiple devices has created new fans. And if the fans are any indication, sports like judo will continue to grow in popularity. Marketing experts say that companies are starting to find ways to take advantage of the 360-degree viewing of sports.For instance, during the 2012 summer games, a mobile-phone company created a campaign to help fans stay keyed-in through several technologies while watching the games. It created an app that gave fans updates on events, including schedules and winners. It also had a Facebook app that let fans see what others were saying about the games on social media. Additionally, a blogger at the company posted updates.Marketing experts say that smart marketers will think of interesting ways not only to take advantage of the more immersive sports-viewing experience, but also to target fans of newly popular sports.\u201cSo many companies want to have a dog in the race,\u201d said Carlos Scott, who owns a sports marketing and public relations firm that represents several gold-medal athletes. \u201cWith the advent of apps and technology, there are companies that could create some serious buzz, even with something like trampoline.\u201dJerry Solomon, a Boston-based sports agent who\u2019s represented big names in figure skating and tennis and now represents Harrison, said marketers can do more with top athletes in newly popular sports. He said those sports don\u2019t have the parameters that are sometimes in place in other sports, so companies can think of marketing ideas that have never been done before.\u201cIn a sport like judo, you sort of have a blank canvas you can work with to create things that are new and different,\u201d Solomon said. \u201cYou can be more creative.\u201d You sort of have a blank canvas you can work with to create things that are new and different.\u201d  A DIGITAL FUTURE FOR SPORTS As digital technology improves and viewers have access to more ways to watch sports, the rise in viewership of all sports \u2014 and newly popular sports, in particular \u2014 will likely continue.Digital will not only continue to drive viewership of the summer games. It will also boost fan engagement by providing more content and ways for enthusiasts to participate in the sports they love.\u201cConsumers are always finding ways to watch what they want, when they want,\u201d said Adobe\u2019s Foster.The ability to watch sports wherever and whenever is good for fans and the sports they love. It\u2019s also beneficial for the top athletes in sports that are gaining popularity because they are getting more recognition.The growing interest in judo has been good for Harrison, who overcame adversity as a teen to rise to the top of her sport. She now runs an organization that helps abused children and says that judo\u2019s greater visibility in the U.S. has meant a lot to her as well as to the sport.\u201cAs long as you have a good message and a good product \u2014 in this case, it\u2019s me and the sport \u2014 I think the opportunities will come, especially if you are getting more visibility,\u201d Harrison said.Source: Adobe Digital Insights Adobe is changing the world through digital experiences.  see how The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "Court Overturns \u2018Burkini\u2019 Ban in French Town", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "Supported byIn its ruling, the court, known as the Council of State, found that the ban in the town of Villeneuve-Loubet violated civil liberties, including freedom of movement and religious freedom, and that officials had failed to show that the swimwear posed a threat to public order.The ruling also made clear that the bans in other municipalities could be similarly overturned, and the Socialist government seemed conflicted on how to respond.In a statement, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve suggested that it was time for the local officials to back down, saying it was now \u201cup to each and every one to responsibly seek to ease tensions, which is the only way to avoid disturbances to public order and to bolster coexistence.\u201dMr. Valls, who last week likened the burkini to a form of \u201censlavement,\u201d said in his comments on Friday that \u201ccondemning the burkini in no way questions individual liberties.\u201dThe court\u2019s decision seemed unlikely to end the controversy as France enters a presidential election season. The center-right former president, Nicolas Sarkozy, who has announced his plans to run for president again, supports a national ban.While the decision does not apply directly to the many other French cities and towns that have banned the burkini, it amounts to a warning that their prohibitions are likely to be overturned if challenged. The largest such community is the city of Nice.The United Nations and the White House seemed relieved by the ruling.\u201cObviously we welcome the decision by the court,\u201d Secretary General Ban Ki-moon\u2019s chief spokesman, St\u00e9phane Dujarric, who had expressed concern about the burkini ban, said at a news briefing, emphasizing \u201cthe need for people\u2019s personal dignity to be respected.\u201dJosh Earnest, a White House spokesman, said the United States did not want to \u201csecond-guess\u201d France, but noted that President Obama \u201cbelieves strongly in the freedom of religion.\u201d\u201cThe council has ruled and has showed that mayors do not have the right to set limits on wearing religious signs in public spaces,\u201d he said, in the absence of a demonstrated threat to public order. \u201cIt is contrary to the freedom of religion, which is a fundamental freedom.\u201dVilleneuve-Loubet, a seaside resort of about 14,000, adopted the ban on Aug. 5, and it was supposed to end on Sept. 15. Police officers in the town will no longer be able to issue fines for burkini-wearing, and women who received fines will be able to contest them.\u201cNormally, mayors should remove their ordinances following this decision, except if they want to race against the clock and go to court,\u201d Mr. Muhammad said, noting that the ordinances are set to expire in the coming weeks, while the court process can drag on for longer. Several mayors have already told French media that they did not intend to remove their bans in light of the ruling.The ordinances in question did not mention Islam or the burkinis explicitly \u2014 instead banned bathing attire that was not \u201cappropriate,\u201d was not \u201crespectful of good morals and of secularism,\u201d or did not respect \u201chygiene and security rules\u201d \u2014 but the target of the laws was obvious.The Council of State said the \u201cemotions and concerns that are the result of the terrorist attacks, most notably the one carried out in Nice last July 14, do not suffice to legally justify the ban.\u201dRestrictions on liberty \u201cmust be justified by proven risks to public order,\u201d the court said, finding that the town\u2019s mayor had failed to meet that criterion.Anti-discrimination and human rights groups had challenged the restrictions in local courts, but the rules were upheld, leading the groups to appeal to the Council of State, which heard arguments from lawyers for both sides on Thursday.The bans have also fueled an intense political debate and split the French government, with Mr. Valls expressing support for them and several female ministers opposing the restrictions, even as they voiced distaste for the garments.Marine Le Pen, the head of the far-right National Front, said after the ruling that French lawmakers should expand a 2004 law that bans ostentatious religious symbols in schools to all public places, except for \u201creligious personnel,\u201d but she did not make clear how broad that exception should be.The showdown over the burkini was only the latest controversy over the principle of la\u00efcit\u00e9, or secularism, that has been a defining feature of French political life since the Revolution. Critics say the principle is increasingly used to justify measures that single out Muslims, rather than keeping government out of religion and vice versa, the original intent.Although the ruling on Friday technically suspended the ban, Mr. Cassia said the decision effectively overturned the prohibition completely and showed that the principle of la\u00efcit\u00e9 had been misapplied by the towns.\u201cIt means neutrality for the state, not the individual,\u201d Mr. Cassia said.He added: \u201cI was in Nice two days ago. There are women in the street with veils. It\u2019s completely unreasonable to ban them from the beach, while they are free to walk around the city. It\u2019s hysteria.\u201dMr. Muhammad, the head of the Collective Against Islamophobia in France, said he feared that in the current political climate, Muslims would continue to be targeted.A video with an earlier version of this article misrepresented the events on two public beaches in France. The woman shown in the beginning of the video was in Nice and the woman interviewed, Siam, was in Cannes. Neither was forced to remove her head scarf.

No, we\u2019re not talking about dropping the Wall Street bull\u2019s testicles on to the floor of Congress, though that was how clever editing made it look last week. Rather, Darlene and her core crew \u2014 the nebbish Mobley, who\u2019s ready to run; the more cautious Trenton, who has her Iranian immigrant family to consider; and Darlene\u2019s ex-boyfriend Cisco, their link to the fearsome Dark Army \u2014 record and broadcast a conference call about the F.B.I.\u2019s \u201cOperation Berenstain,\u201d which is warrantlessly monitoring the communications of millions of Americans to hunt for the hack\u2019s perpetrators.\u201cBackdoor access to every smartphone,\u201d a list of cooperating companies that includes \u201cGoogle, AT&T, Uber, Apple, Verizon, Facebook\u201d: This wholesale collusion between the state and corporations to violate privacy is so grimly plausible it barely qualifies as fiction, even before footage of Edward Snowden is repurposed to comment on the scandal.Yet Darlene\u2019s rhetoric in the broadcast, alarmingly violent even by the standards of a group that uses a slasher\u2019s mask as its sigil, is an early indication that the group is feeling desperate. She refers to the government\u2019s \u201ctyrannical rape of our private data,\u201d a disturbing choice of words given fsociety\u2019s collaboration with Julian Assange\u2019s WikiLeaks and its own less than stellar track record with both rape and private data.\u201cWe will destroy you!\u201d she barks at the feds, once again adopting \u201cwar on terror\u201d verbiage \u2014 not a promising route to success. So when the E Corp lawyer Susan Jacobs, a.k.a. Madame Executioner, has her \u201csmart home\u201d unexpectedly commandeered as the group\u2019s headquarters, what befalls her has a nauseating air of inevitability to it.Not that Jacobs comes across as anything but awful during her too-brief stint as the group\u2019s hostage. She goads Trenton about her Muslim faith in an attempt to escape: \u201cIs that what this is about? ISIS or something?\u201d And proceeding to call them a bunch of animals.It does her no good, though, since the moment she slips loose she tries to attack Trenton and winds up banging her head on the wall, knocking herself out. Realizing she\u2019ll need medical care, the frightened foursome frantically search her personal accounts for information with which to blackmail her before they take her to a hospital, and discover that she\u2019s been sleeping with judges in exchange for more favorable verdicts. As their leader, Darlene volunteers to confront Jacobs with their discovery \u2014 but instead tazes her and leaves her to drown in her swimming pool, committing a murder that had been on her mind ever since she was 4 years old and saw Jacobs laughing about the case that killed her and Elliot\u2019s father.From there, things manage to get even uglier, somehow. Darlene and Cisco take Jacobs\u2019s body to the pet crematory they use to dispose of evidence, and are forced to remove her body from the suitcase they\u2019d packed it in and jam it directly into the oven. Mobley and Trenton return home, looking over their shoulders, jumping at every sound \u2014 jittery editing and sudden crash cuts heighten the sense of fear. Sure enough, Mobley is arrested by Dom DiPierro, but she has no idea how high up he is, suspecting him merely of being the D.J. at fsociety\u2019s party the night of the hack. Her superior forces her to let him go in light of the bad press that the bureau is already receiving. He signals to Trenton that they\u2019ve been burned and have to flee, but never shows up at their designated meeting place. Darlene, meanwhile, sleeps at Cisco\u2019s place, and awakens to discover that he\u2019s reporting on her to the Dark Army; the episode ends when she smashes his laptop, then hits him in the head with a baseball bat.Even the relatively tangential Angela has a terrible time of things. She has an ugly confrontation with one of her father\u2019s working-class friends; he hits her with crude sexual insults, she responds with classist cheap shots. She sings a joyless rendition of Tears for Fears\u2019 \u201cEverybody Wants to Rule the World\u201d at karaoke, then ditches her boyfriend for an older man of dubious intent played by Mark Moses (Duck Phillips of \u201cMad Men\u201d). This, perhaps, is for the best, since said boyfriend was an undercover F.B.I. agent, but even so \u2014 just ask Peggy Olson how dating Duck Phillips turned out.But in Elliot\u2019s absence, the episode\u2019s true star is the composer Mac Quayle\u2019s score. The show\u2019s usual electronic hum is complemented, and at times supplanted, by screeching strings and dissonant jolts straight out of a horror film. Which, of course, is what the episode really is: a monster movie, if only in the Nietzschean sense. Darlene has dedicated her life to fighting monsters, and now she\u2019s become one herself. Emerging from an hour of television this expertly discomfiting feels like bursting free of a haunted house.Advertisement"}

The reason it caused so much damage is that many of the beautiful ancient buildings are composed of unreinforced masonry (stone).These are the most dangerous buildings to be in during an earthquake as they have very little sheer strength, and therefore collapse when exposed to lateral ground accelerations. Such buildings can undergo seismic retrofitting, but the process is expensive and I suspect that most buildings in Italy have not undergone such a procedure.So therefore it is likely an unaddressed infrastructure issue that led to wide such spread devastation.We were fine, just broken dishes and books everywhere, but I remember the terror. I can\u2019t imagine how these people felt as their houses collapsed around them.My heart goes out to Italy. Know that many Americans who have lived through earthquakes themselves are thinking of you.We hope many are pulled from the rubble alive. And hopefully you can rebuild stronger.

{"Headline": "Snapchat Used to Spook Advertisers. Not Anymore.", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYet by this June, when the conference was held again in Cannes, Snapchat had become one of the most buzzed-about marketing platforms. It is convincing companies that its ads \u2014 which let users adorn pictures and videos with all manner of images and branding \u2014 create a more interactive experience than Facebook and YouTube ads, which most users watch passively.\u201cAdvertisers want to be associated with the trendiest, newest thing, and this year, that\u2019s Snapchat,\u201d said Chad Stoller, executive vice president and global innovation director of IPG Mediabrands.How Snapchat got its ad business on track is a case study of a fast-growing start-up overcoming growing pains and persuading companies to try untested ways to reach consumers.When Snapchat opened itself up to advertisers more than a year ago, many initially griped that the company needed to lower its ad prices. Some were mystified about how to reach the right audience with the ads, since Snapchat did not provide traditional ad-targeting tools. Most of all, brands wondered how Snapchat could be effective when the ads \u2014 like Snapchat messages \u2014 disappeared.In the last 15 months, Snapchat has moved to respond. It introduced new ad formats. It dangled its attractive user base \u2014 the service now claims 150 million daily users, including nearly half the country\u2019s population from ages 18 to 34 \u2014 to lure advertisers. Most important, Snapchat has persuaded brands like Tiffany & Company, Kraft Foods and Burger King that its ads let them interact playfully with this young audience.When Snapchat entered the ad business, \u201cit didn\u2019t quite have the infrastructure, and the market didn\u2019t understand it,\u201d said Sarah Hofstetter, chief executive of the ad agency 360i. \u201cIt was a bumpy beginning.\u201dIn an interview, Imran Khan, Snapchat\u2019s chief strategy officer, said the company\u2019s ad formats gave brands \u201ca creative platform\u201d that made ads a \u201cnatural experience.\u201d Snapchat declined to comment on its revenue.\u201cAt that price, it was too hard to test the waters and learn in a new environment,\u201d said Ms. Hofstetter of 360i.Mr. Khan set about trying to respond to concerns while building out an ad team. He recently recruited Viacom\u2019s advertising sales chief, Jeff Lucas, to be his new vice president for ad sales. He opened new ad sales offices in cities such as London and Sydney, Australia, to provide more support to those making ads for Snapchat.Snapchat also began introducing less expensive ad products, some of which start at just $5. This summer, the company let third parties sell ad space on Snapchat, which makes it easier to get more ads onto the app.Mr. Khan\u2019s biggest job was to explain why Snapchat\u2019s unusual platform was better for advertisers. The task was thorny because Snapchat is a messaging, sharing and broadcast service where most content disappears. Companies had few comparable apps to judge Snapchat against.Brands that \u201chad become too focused on metrics\u201d suddenly saw in Snapchat a \u201cplayful way to deepen customer loyalty and affinity,\u201d said Constance DeCherney, director of strategy at the ad agency TDA Boulder.\u201cIt was all taco, taco, taco,\u201d said Ryan Rimsnider, senior manager of Taco Bell\u2019s social media team. \u201cIt was a little surreal.\u201dTaco Bell, a major advertiser, was an early supporter of using Snapchat as a branding tool. Snapchat executives recently attended Taco Bell\u2019s three-year \u201cSnapiversary,\u201d which included a custom geofilter for the event. Taco Bell later sent a taco truck to Snapchat\u2019s headquarters.Since those early ad experiments, other brands have started campaigns on the messaging service. Last week, Tiffany & Company began its first Snapchat campaign with a lens of the Tiffany logo and flying hearts in Tiffany blue that people could use to decorate their selfies and videos.Snapchat said millions of consumers in the United States, Australia and Italy played with the lens for about the same amount of time as it takes to watch a normal video ad. They then shared their pictures and videos, spreading Tiffany\u2019s brand. The lens is now gone, replaced by a geofilter that adds Tiffany-branded stickers to photos when you enter a Tiffany store.\u201cConsumers want something more than a passive experience,\u201d said Diana Hong-Elsey, Tiffany\u2019s vice president for global digital marketing. \u201cWhen you know content will disappear, you want to interact with it in that moment.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "John McLaughlin, TV Host Who Made Combat of Punditry, Dies at 89", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJohn McLaughlin, a former Roman Catholic priest who became an aide to Richard M. Nixon in the White House and parlayed his fierce defense of the president into a television career as host of \u201cThe McLaughlin Group,\u201d the long-running Sunday morning program of combative political punditry, died on Tuesday at his home in Washington. He was 89.Mr. McLaughlin had been absent from the show this last weekend for the first time in more than 34 years. \u201cI am under the weather,\u201d he wrote to viewers in a note that began the broadcast, adding that his voice was \u201cweaker than usual\u201d but that his \u201cspirit is strong.\u201dAs creator, executive producer and host of \u201cThe McLaughlin Group,\u201d which began in 1982, Mr. McLaughlin helped reinvent the political talk-show format by injecting unabashed partisanship and a dash of entertainment.His program, broadcast on select CBS and PBS stations, inspired a generation of pundits, although few quite adopted his self-exaggerated, blustery persona. His penchant for giving nicknames to his panelists, his riffling through the week\u2019s topics and his prosecutorial questioning became fodder for comedians, notably Dana Carvey on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d even while policy makers tuned in for the political observations.The show always ended with a prediction by each of the panelists, with Mr. McLaughlin getting the final word, even if seemingly with tongue in cheek. In 1989, for example, he predicted, \u201cWithin weeks, Delaware will authorize public flogging for drug trafficking.\u2019\u2019 (It did not.) His trademark signoff was a robust \u201cBye-bye!\u201dMr. McLaughlin, who left the priesthood in 1975, \u201cproved that you could be provocative and an advocate and entertaining, and bring a larger audience to public affairs programming,\u201d said Tammy Haddad, a former vice president of political coverage for MSNBC. Ms. Haddad was also an executive producer of \u201cHardball With Chris Matthews,\u201d whose host got ample exposure on Mr. McLaughlin\u2019s weekly round table earlier in his career.\u201cThe early success of CNN,\u201d Ms. Haddad noted, was based on its \u201cpolitical food fights\u201d by the likes of Robert Novak and Patrick J. Buchanan, both of whom were founding \u201cMcLaughlin Group\u201d panelists.While in the White House, Mr. McLaughlin, well-informed but prone to tirades, would \u201csometimes almost become a cartoon of himself\u201d when reporters called, said Bob Schieffer, the CBS News Washington reporter who became host of the CBS Sunday show \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d But as a talk-show host, Mr. Schieffer said, Mr. McLaughlin changed the industry with his shouting.Combativeness was part of Mr. McLaughlin\u2019s style from the beginning. As a Jesuit priest, he had been in frequent conflict with his superiors, who disapproved of his 1970 run for the United States Senate in Rhode Island as a Republican calling for a rapid end to the Vietnam War. Father McLaughlin, who had resigned as an editor at the Jesuit magazine America and switched his party affiliation, was believed to be the first active Roman Catholic priest to run for the Senate.He stood in sharp contrast to his fellow Jesuit Robert Drinan of Massachusetts, who was given permission to run for the House that same year as an antiwar Democrat. Father McLaughlin, who was chastised by the bishop of Providence, R.I., for his Senate run, lost by a wide margin to the incumbent Democrat, John O. Pastore.Father McLaughlin went to Washington anyway, joining President Nixon\u2019s speechwriting team in 1971. Nicknamed Nixon\u2019s Priest, he gave frequent speeches in defense of the president\u2019s conduct of the Vietnam War, including bombing missions into Cambodia.As the Watergate crisis deepened, Father McLaughlin became one of the president\u2019s most visible supporters. At one news conference, he dismissed Nixon\u2019s use of profanity as \u201cemotional drainage.\u201d Less than two weeks before the president resigned, Father McLaughlin warned in a speech at the National Press Club that the nation would face a \u201cparade of horrors\u201d should Nixon be impeached. (On July 31, 1973, Father Drinan became the first congressman to call for impeachment in a House resolution.)After Vice President Gerald R. Ford succeeded Nixon in August 1974, Father McLaughlin\u2019s speechwriting position was abolished.Father McLaughlin had maintained a high profile in Washington, living at the tony Watergate complex rather than in the austere Jesuit residence at Georgetown University where Father Drinan lived. This led his church superiors to rebuke him in May 1974, summoning him to a period of \u201creflection.\u201dInstead, in 1975, Mr. McLaughlin successfully petitioned Pope Paul VI and was released from his vows.John Joseph McLaughlin was born in Providence on March 29, 1927, to the former Eva Turcotte and Augustus H. McLaughlin, a regional salesman for a furniture company. After graduating from LaSalle Academy in Providence and studying for the priesthood in Massachusetts, he was ordained a priest in 1959.He earned master\u2019s degrees in philosophy and English literature from Boston College, and a doctorate in philosophy from Columbia University. He then taught at the Jesuit-run Fairfield College Preparatory School in Connecticut.After leaving the White House, he and his wife at the time, Ms. Dore, founded a media relations and public affairs consulting company. In the early 1980s, Mr. McLaughlin hosted a weekend talk program on the Washington radio station WRC. After joining the magazine National Review as the Washington editor and a columnist, he founded a television production concern with the backing of former Nixon allies and persuaded NBC\u2019s Washington television affiliate, WRC-TV, to broadcast a new type of weekend political talk show and to let him host it.At the time, TV round tables of journalists like \u201cAgronsky & Company\u201d and \u201cWashington Week in Review\u201d dissected the week\u2019s developments in a sober, nonpartisan style. Mr. McLaughlin envisioned a more animated, argumentative format including a panel reflecting conservative, moderate and liberal views, with him as moderator.From its debut in 1982 \u201cThe McLaughlin Group\u201d took on the flavor of a barroom debate, pitting a largely white, male cadre of columnists and political insiders against one another as they gave vent to views from the hard right (Mr. Novak and Mr. Buchanan) to the center-left (Morton Kondracke of The New Republic and Jack Germond of The Baltimore Sun). Ms. Clift, a Newsweek correspondent at the time, and the Chicago Tribune columnist Clarence Page, who is black, later joined the group as more liberal regulars.Regardless of the panelists\u2019 political persuasions, Mr. McLaughlin, whose own politics leaned decidedly right, would often fire off questions and cut them off, shouting \u201cWronnnng!\u201dWhen the cameras were off, the panelists often feuded. Mr. Novak left after a falling out in 1988 and founded a similar program on CNN, \u201cCapital Gang.\u201d In an interview on PBS in June 2007, Mr. Novak said of Mr. McLaughlin, \u201cHe may not be pure evil, but he\u2019s close to it.\u201d Mr. Germond, another of the original panelists, called the show \u201creally bad TV,\u201d and said he had stayed on only because he needed the money to pay his daughter\u2019s medical school tuition.Mr. McLaughlin was also the executive producer and host of \u201cJohn McLaughlin\u2019s One on One,\u201d a weekly interview program that was broadcast on NBC and PBS stations. From 1989 to 1994 he hosted a daily interview show on CNBC.An obituary on Wednesday about John McLaughlin, the host of the long-running television talk show \u201cThe McLaughlin Group,\u201d referred incorrectly to the magazine National Review, where he worked in the 1980s. It is published biweekly, not weekly. The obituary also misstated the length of Mr. McLaughlin\u2019s tenure there.

{"Headline": "The Women Who Won\u2019t Wear Swimsuits", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThis isn\u2019t a real thing,\u201d my husband grumbled as he followed me up the stairs one morning in June.He didn\u2019t understand.Woman versus swimsuit is a tale as old as \u2014 well, maybe just as old as that yellowing \u201cCathy\u201d cartoon that your mom stuck on the fridge, underneath a bovine-shaped magnet that read \u201cHoly Cow, Are You Eating Again?\u201dIn the grand scheme of things, feeling bad about your jiggly bits as you wrestle them into scraps of Lycra in the unforgiving light of a department-store dressing room doesn\u2019t compare with not having food or clean water. That being said, there are women out there who just don\u2019t. They don\u2019t wear swimsuits. They don\u2019t go to the beach. They basically forgo summer, and the camera, because they hate the way they look.Thus, our excursion to the roof.I put on sunscreen, and lipstick, and a new size 16 swimsuit, black with a ruffled pink trim and a little slip of a skirt. I took a deep breath, pulled my shoulders back, and tried to believe that I looked O.K. and not to flinch as he said, \u201cHere we go.\u201dInside, I picked out my favorite shot, skipped the filters, went to my Facebook page, held my breath and hit \u201cpost.\u201d The next time I looked, there were dozens of pictures of women in swimsuits \u2014 women who looked more like me, less like the airbrushed, perfected creatures I seem to spend my life looking at.Then, during the Olympics, in between commentators\u2019 cracks about how a female swimmer\u2019s husband was actually the one responsible for her gold medal, or how our gymnasts looked as if they should have been hanging out at a mall, you could actually see larger bodies being celebrated for their achievements; bodies that were winning medals as opposed to being \u201cbefores\u201d on those weight-loss reality shows.There was Michelle Carter, who calls herself the Shot Diva, all lashes and fuchsia lips, and thick, muscular arms and solid thighs. Arms like mine! Legs like mine! Except hers heaved the shot a gold-medal-winning distance.Both women seemed comfortable in their own skin, proud of what their bodies could accomplish.It was so good to hear, and so rare. The Olympians are the outliers; their words a dissent to the daily chorus that tells us, and tells us, and tells us that larger bodies are loathsome, are laughable, are undeserving of love.I was lucky. I had a mom who was always swimming, even when the choices of swimsuits for larger bodies were limited to horrid floral skirted things that flapped and dragged in the water while she churned out her daily mile. Staying on land, I learned, was not an option, especially when I had babies of my own to hold and help.And so, even at my heaviest I never hesitated to put on a bathing suit and go in the water. Maybe that\u2019s why my husband couldn\u2019t understand: that there are women out there for whom bathing suits are very big deals; women who maybe could use a little push.I wasn\u2019t expecting #weartheswimsuit, the hashtag I used for that first Facebook photo, to take off the way it did. By the end of the week in June when I posted it, after some blogs had noticed and I got to talk about it on morning television, my Facebook page was overflowing with pictures of women of all shapes and sizes. Women on beaches, on floats, on stand-up paddleboards; women water-skiing or leaping off docks or cradling their babies in the kiddie pool.Then there were comments that made me cry. One woman wrote that she and her family had been going to the shore for over a decade and, \u201cthis was the first time I wore a suit. Another wrote: \u201cI have downright refused to wear a suit for YEARS. I avoid swimming altogether, and it\u2019s actually one of my favorite things to do.\u201dThis is how it is, for so many women. We endure the summer heat, swathed in cover-ups, sweating in sleeved shirts. We become inured to the indignities: hearing casual fat jokes, knowing that exercising in public means risking mockery; seeing strong, healthy, larger bodies once every four years, winning gold medals but somehow never getting many big-dollar endorsement deals or a gig on \u201cDancing With the Stars.\u201dThese are the images I want to take with me from this summer: Sarah Robles\u2019s smile; Michelle Carter\u2019s confidence, and what my Facebook friend Jaime Rydman wrote beneath a shot of herself in a black one-piece with waves frothing around her ankles and wrote, \u201cI\u2019d always say \u2018this will make a good \u2018before\u2019 picture. I need to stop ... it makes a good NOW picture!\u201dJennifer Weiner is the author of the forthcoming memoir \u201cHungry Heart,\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Phoenix Rattled as Serial Gunman Leaves 7 Dead and 2 Injured", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "Supported byOn a recent summer evening, a young man and a toddler were in a car stopped in a residential neighborhood in Phoenix when gunfire erupted. The two were not hurt, but investigators later said that it slowly dawned on them that they had a larger crime on their hands: A serial shooter had struck again.The attack on the car carrying the 21-year-old man and the 4-year-old boy on July 11 was the ninth time that an unidentified shooter had preyed on the city\u2019s neighborhoods this year, the police said. Since March, seven people have been killed and two injured.On Wednesday, the authorities stepped up their efforts to solve the shootings by republicizing an artist\u2019s sketch of the suspect, revealing details about the vehicles he had driven and raising the reward for any information leading to an arrest to $50,000 from $30,000.\u201cSomeone out there knows who did this,\u201d Joseph Yahner, chief of the Phoenix Police Department, said in a statement on Facebook.The Federal Bureau of Investigation and other federal agencies are also taking part in the search.The reward and the release of additional information have fueled amateur sleuthing by residents who are sharing ideas and information and suggesting lines of investigation via the Police Department\u2019s Facebook and Twitter pages, upending the notion of the traditional telephone tip line as a tool to help solve crimes.When investigators revealed that the suspect has access to several vehicles, including a BMW, a white Cadillac or \u201cLincoln-type vehicle,\u201d readers pressed for more details:\u201cAre the Cadillac and or Lincoln cars or SUVs?\u201d one man wrote.\u201cIf he has access to multiple vehicles could be working at a dealership,\u201d another wrote.\u201cOr maybe a mechanic!\u201d a third said.Some comments reflected a city unnerved by the seeming randomness of the targets.\u201cEverybody, let\u2019s help each other, protect each other, save a life before this punk takes another life,\u201d wrote one reader using the name Robin Chief.\u201cThis is ridiculous. How is this serial shooter making his way across Phoenix?\u201d another wrote.That string of highway shootings between Aug. 29 and Sept. 10 remains unsolved after prosecutors dismissed 16 felony charges against their sole suspect, Leslie Allen Merritt Jr., in April. No one was killed in those shootings.Others tried to ascribe a motive, saying the gunman could be a member of a hate group because the victims were either Hispanic or black. But there is no evidence yet to attribute a deliberate racial motive, Sgt. Jonathan Howard, a police spokesman, said on Thursday.Police officials said that while the online enthusiasm was encouraging, they urged residents to report information to the department.\u201cThe investigative team is counting on tips from the community to help solve these crimes,\u201d Sergeant g Howard said on Thursday. \u201cTips are coming in from a wide variety of sources including social media. However, we are encouraging people to report their tips directly.\u201dThe victims include Manuel Castro Garcia, who was killed in front of a home on June 10; and a 16-year-old boy who was wounded while walking in the street about 11:30 p.m. on March 17.The fear and uncertainty unleashed by the shootings are reminiscent of the terror that can follow random attacks, such as the ones by John Allen Muhammad and John Lee Malvo in 2002 in the Washington and Virginia areas.Almost all the shootings happened in southwest Phoenix, in predominantly Latino, working-class neighborhoods of low-slung cinder block houses, where many immigrant families find their foothold in the city. People who live there are worried and extra cautious about lingering on their driveways too long at night or letting children play on front yards.On the northeast side of the city, which is wealthier and predominantly white, the shootings rarely come up in conversation.Residents of the Maryvale neighborhood, site of at least one attack, say they are afraid to sit on their stoops, according to The Arizona Republic. Shrines of flowers and candles have cropped up on sidewalks. Some of those fatally shot had been listening to music in a car, or locking a door or heading to work.Fernanda Santos contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Think Tanks Amplify Corporate America\u2019s Influence", "Date": "2016-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThis can become a productive, mutually beneficial relationship,\u201d Bruce Katz, a Brookings vice president, wrote to Lennar in July 2010. The ultimate benefit for Brookings: $400,000 in donations from Lennar\u2019s different divisions.\u201cHe would be a trusted adviser,\u201d an internal Brookings memo said in 2014 as the think tank sought one $100,000 donation from Lennar.Think tanks, which position themselves as \u201cuniversities without students,\u201d have power in government policy debates because they are seen as researchers independent of moneyed interests. But in the chase for funds, think tanks are pushing agendas important to corporate donors, at times blurring the line between researchers and lobbyists. And they are doing so while reaping the benefits of their tax-exempt status, sometimes without disclosing their connections to corporate interests.Similar arrangements exist at many think tanks. On issues as varied as military sales to foreign countries, international trade, highway management systems and real estate development, think tanks have frequently become vehicles for corporate influence and branding campaigns.The shift has occurred as nonprofits in general have been under increasing pressure from their donors to meet specific goals. But for think tanks, that pressure can threaten their standing as independent arbiters in policy debates in Congress, the White House and the news media.\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice to go back to the greatest generation, in the post-World War II era of philanthropy, where they said, gosh, \u2018Here is $1 million; spend it how you wish,\u2019\u201d Kimberly Churches, the managing director at Brookings, said in an interview.Think tank executives reject any suggestion that they are tools of corporate influence campaigns and say they are simply teaming up with donors that have similar goals, like helping cities with economic development.But he acknowledged that the arrangement to appoint the Lennar executive as a senior fellow had created the \u201cappearance of a conflict of interest.\u201d And he said that Brookings, in the interest of transparency, had recently decided to prohibit corporations or corporate-backed foundations from making anonymous contributions.Still, the benefits afforded to corporations looking to cloak themselves with the authority of think tanks are strikingly evident, according to a review of documents from more than a dozen institutions.The likely conclusions of some think tank reports, documents show, are discussed with donors \u2014 or even potential ones \u2014 before the research is complete. Drafts of the studies have been shared with donors whose opinions have then helped shape final reports. Donors have outlined how the resulting scholarship will be used as part of broader lobbying efforts. The think tanks also help donors promote their corporate brands, as Brookings does with JPMorgan Chase, whose $15.5 million contribution is the largest by a private corporation in the institution\u2019s history.Despite these benefits, corporations can write off the donations as charitable contributions. Some tax experts say these arrangements may amount to improper subsidies by taxpayers if think tanks are providing specific services.The Brookings Institution \u2014 long recognized as one of the most prestigious think tanks in the world \u2014 has aggressively courted corporate donors over the last decade, particularly for its Metropolitan Policy Program, which formed partnerships with JPMorgan Chase, Lennar Corporation, K.K.R., Hitachi and others. Here is an examination of the deals with these donors, based in part on thousands of pages of internal Brookings documents.Executives at Brookings, the Center for Strategic and International Studies and other think tanks say they have systems in place to ensure that their reports are based on scholars\u2019 independent conclusions.\u201c\u2018Are you going to say drones are bad?\u2019\u201d she recalled one potential financial backer asking. \u201c\u2018We are not interested in funding something that says drones are bad.\u2019\u201dThe confidential Brookings spreadsheet had an unassuming title: Corporate Overviews Tracking. It listed nearly 90 corporations, from Alcoa to Wells Fargo, providing a glimpse of the vast electronic file that Brookings maintained on donors and prospects, and the benefits it might offer.The database, along with thousands of pages of emails, solicitations for money and memos on meetings with corporate officials, highlighted Brookings\u2019s practice of assuring that donors would see results from their contributions.The files included company priorities and a tally of donations. General Electric wanted to fund work on rail networks and clean energy programs \u2014 both critical parts of its business \u2014 and Brookings then featured G.E. executives, joined by officials from the White House and Congress, at events that focused on these industries.From the start, the program blended a variety of insights on urban matters, including from corporate, nonprofit and government sources. And Mr. Indyk noted that any reports issued were made public.Donations to the program exploded, from $4.3 million in 2005 to $12.5 million in 2013, nearly 20 percent of Brookings\u2019s overall program spending that year.In advance of a 2014 event Brookings officials attended with corporate executives including Henry R. Kravis, a co-chairman of K.K.R., one memo marked as confidential noted: \u201cK.K.R. has given a total of $350K to Brookings. Last gift came in on 3/27/2014 for $150K to Metro; Henry has donated $75K to Brookings, most going to the individual unrestricted fund.\u201dThe tally demonstrates the important distinction that Brookings makes between \u201cunrestricted\u201d donations, which the think tank can spend on any research, and project-based funding restricted to specific topics that the donor has a particular interest in.The San Francisco project generated controversy from the beginning, with critics concerned about toxic waste left by the former Navy shipyard.A spokesman for Lennar, Glenn Bunting, disputed claims that the company had donated to Brookings out of self-interest \u2014 and said the alliance was not related to the protests.\u201cThere was nothing needed in the way of assistance for Lennar to \u2018buy\u2019 from Brookings,\u201d Mr. Bunting said in an email. Brookings, though, continued to promote the project.The think tank soon delivered.But Mr. Indyk acknowledged that naming Mr. Bonner, who declined to be interviewed, a Brookings nonresident scholar had \u201ccreated the impression that because Lennar was giving money, he was getting the title.\u201d His post, which was unpaid, was not renewed.Officials at Brookings said they had not lobbied for Hitachi, and they provided examples of reports that they said included conclusions challenging the company\u2019s position. \u201cHelping a corporation\u2019s for-profit agenda is not in any way our agenda,\u201d Ms. Churches, the managing director, said.Yet Ms. Churches also said the contract language with donors like Lennar and Hitachi was \u201cinelegant,\u201d although not improper.When asked if the documents read like a fee-for-service agreement, she said, \u201cIt could be misconstrued.\u201dMr. Indyk said Brookings had recently changed its policies so that \u201ctoday, there is no way in which those words would be used in our documents.\u201dThe project was premised on a common interest between the bank and the think tank. Brookings wanted to promote economic growth in cities by encouraging international trade, and JPMorgan wanted to gain new business by offering loans to companies in the same markets.Mr. Indyk and executives from JPMorgan said the company and the think tank simply agreed on a worthy agenda.\u201cThis was about growing the economy, and we are incredibly proud of the results of this initiative,\u201d said Peter Scher, the head of the corporate responsibility program at JPMorgan. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s had a huge impact in more than 30 cities that are involved.\u201dAt the same time, hundreds of pages of memos \u2014 status reports to JPMorgan, internal reports by Brookings staff to prepare for meetings with top bank executives, and formal documents soliciting more money \u2014 make clear that Brookings saw the Global Cities Initiative as a branding effort that could help JPMorgan bolster its standing in cities.And Brookings was ready to do its part.At times, Brookings officials seemed worried they were not doing enough for the bank.\u201cNo one wants to create overt marketing opportunities for JPMC, but we need to carve out roles and thought leadership opportunity for market presidents,\u201d said a 2013 Brookings memo, referring to a dinner with the bank\u2019s executives. \u201cWe need to do a better job tying it back to JPMC.\u201dIt remains difficult to assess whether the relationship helped the bank\u2019s business, but Mr. Scher said that was not the goal.\u201cIf the Global Cities Initiative strengthens the economic competitiveness of cities, it\u2019s a win for small businesses, job creation and everyone involved in these communities, including us,\u201d Mr. Scher said in a statement.Donations from the corporations to Brookings are tax exempt based on the premise that the think tank\u2019s work benefits the public good, not a company\u2019s bottom line.\u201cTax deductions are subsidies that are paid for by all taxpayers,\u201d Ms. Fleischer said. \u201cAnd the reason the subsidy is provided is that the charitable organization is supposed to be doing something for the public good, not that specifically benefits the private individual or corporation in the form of providing them goods or services.\u201dMr. Indyk said that opinion was \u201ctotally unfounded,\u201d noting that Brookings had retained its own lawyers to review the documents and found no problems.Other think tanks have been even more closely aligned with corporate agendas.The Atlantic Council, which has seen its annual revenue grow to $21 million from $2 million in the last decade, offers access to United States and foreign government officials in exchange for contributions. Individual donors, like FedEx, have also helped fund specific reports that align with their agendas.Six months before the Atlantic Council report was issued, FedEx and the think tank worked on plans to use the report as a lobbying tool.FedEx and the Atlantic Council, working with the European American Chamber of Commerce, also told companies being asked to participate in the study that the goal was to \u201cemphasize the positive impact that a comprehensive agreement would have on American and European small businesses.\u201dAn executive vice president at FedEx, Rajesh Subramaniam, attended an event at Atlantic Council headquarters in Washington to celebrate the release of the final report. So did a key supporter, Representative Erik Paulsen, Republican of Minnesota.Frederick Kempe, the Atlantic Council president, said that FedEx had donated just $20,000 to help fund the effort and that the staff at the Atlantic Council had handled the research.\u201cThere is no doubt the work of think tanks has more credibility than the work of lobbyists, but the only way we preserve it is through intellectual independence,\u201d Mr. Kempe said.General Atomics, the California-based manufacturer of Predator drones, had a clear problem. Prospects for sales were falling as the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq wound down. The company wanted the Obama administration to change its policy to allow for sales to other countries, a lucrative proposition.At about that time, the industry turned to the Center for Strategic and International Studies for help, providing money that the think tank used to conduct a study on drone policy, including exports.While defense contracting giants like Lockheed Martin and Boeing have cumulatively donated at least $77 million since 2010 to two dozen think tanks, disclosure records show, General Atomics\u2019s contribution to the Center for Strategic and International Studies was quite small \u2014 in the tens of thousands of dollars.As General Atomics was lobbying for a change in export rules governing its unmanned aerial vehicles, it helped fund a report at the Center for Strategic and International Studies that also pushed for the change.As a think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies did not file a lobbying report, but the goals of the effort were clear.Boeing and Lockheed Martin, drone makers that were major C.S.I.S. contributors, were also invited to attend the sessions, the emails show. The meetings and research culminated with a report released in February 2014 that reflected the industry\u2019s priorities.\u201cI came out strongly in support of export,\u201d Mr. Brannen, the lead author of the study, wrote in an email to Kenneth B. Handelman, the deputy assistant secretary of state for defense trade controls.But the effort did not stop there.Mr. Brannen, who has since left C.S.I.S., declined to comment. The think tank insisted that its efforts to influence administration policy were not lobbying.\u201cC.S.I.S. will not represent any donor before any government office or entity, including congressional lawmakers and executive branch officials,\u201d Mr. Hamre, the chief executive, said in his statement to The Times. \u201cWe do not lobby.\u201dOne thing is clear: The result was a victory for General Atomics.A State Department spokesman said that while the government officials involved in the review had received opinions from think tanks and industry officials, \u201cat the end of the day, this is a considered U.S. government policy.\u201dLater, after he had joined the Hudson Institute and helped create the Center for American Seapower, he approached Huntington officials again, and they were interested.\u201cA think tank has more prestige,\u201d Mr. McGrath said.Huntington Ingalls paid $100,000 to fund the work, a critical commitment for Mr. McGrath, who said he was paid by Hudson only if he could successfully solicit donations to support his research.Mr. McGrath said he had always been a strong proponent of aircraft carriers, so the company was not buying his opinion.\u201cThe Hudson Center makes no secret about being very pro-sea power,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a company came that wanted us to write a piece that advocated for something other than that, the answer would be no.\u201dIn exchange for Huntington Ingalls\u2019s support, company officials were given regular briefings on the research and the opportunity to suggest revisions to early drafts, Mr. McGrath said.Huntington Ingalls, the sole builder of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers in the United States, and other players in the shipbuilding industry were looking for ways to increase or maintain funding for the construction of these giant ships. They turned to think tanks for help. Here is a look at the strategy, which involved the Hudson Institute and others.\u201cWe have an iterative process already laid out in which we will sit down with them and go through drafts and discuss where we are going,\u201d Mr. McGrath said. He added that he had not accepted all of the company\u2019s suggestions.The strategy \u2014 lining up think tank reports as lobbying tools that echoed each other \u2014 was backed up with a series of letters to the editor, dozens of posts on Twitter and Facebook, and op-ed pieces.Mr. McGrath said he, too, wondered if this storm of industry-funded work might be threatening the integrity of the process.\u201cI see a lot of stuff that comes out in Washington,\u201d Mr. McGrath said, \u201cand I got to scratch my head and say, \u2018That guy must be on the payroll.\u2019\u201dBrooke Williams is a reporter at the New England Center for Investigative Reporting, which collaborated with The New York Times on this series.

{"Headline": "Want to Own a Newspaper? A Vermont Contest Has Trouble Finding Takers", "Date": "2016-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHARDWICK, Vt. \u2014 Like most people who work for small newspapers, Vanessa Fournier wears many hats.A photographer, she shoots pictures for The Hardwick Gazette, the weekly broadsheet that has been documenting life here in Vermont\u2019s hardscrabble Northeast Kingdom since 1889. On Wednesdays, she is the paper\u2019s local distributor. With bundles of the freshly printed Gazette tucked into the trunk of her Honda Civic, Ms. Fournier, 61, makes her way through town, plunking down papers on countertops, slipping them into wire racks and keeping up a cheerful patter with shopkeepers.Now, she worries that both jobs could end.Unfortunately for him, the contest has not generated the interest that he had hoped would make his plan financially viable. So he has extended the deadline to Sept. 20 from Aug. 11.When asked if he had a Plan C if he had still not received enough entries in a month, he offered a blunt analogy: He could extend the deadline again, he said, but that would be \u201clike pounding your thumb with a hammer \u2014 it\u2019s not going to stop hurting.\u201dThat could sum up the newspaper business these days, at least for many big dailies, which have been upended by the internet and are in a frantic race to reinvent themselves to stay relevant in today\u2019s crowded and fragmented news media environment. The New England landscape is dotted with papers of significant lineage, many of them going through upheavals in ownership as they struggle to survive.But, Mr. Benton cautioned, the ad base can dry up, especially in the era of Amazon and big-box stores.The Gazette has been operating for 127 years, growing along with the town\u2019s granite industry. Work at the quarries peaked in 1910, as did Hardwick\u2019s population, hitting 3,200. The town then retrenched as it returned to its agricultural roots.Mr. Connelly, a trim man with close-cropped white hair and a steady gaze, who has carved out a small sitting space in front of piles of paper on his overstuffed wooden desk, has been the Gazette\u2019s steward for three decades. He is determined to find someone to whom to pass the torch.But when the contest closed Aug. 11, he had not received the 700 essays that he said was the minimum needed to make the contest financially viable. He would not say how many he had received, nor would he share the contents of the entries, saying he did not want to skew the judging.He did say that the paper, which has a paid circulation of 2,200, grossed $240,000 last year. He had figured that, with a contest entry fee of $175, 700 essays would yield enough, $122,500, to cover the Gazette building, computers and taxes and send him on his glide to retirement.He has a few guesses about why not enough entries materialized.\u201cMaybe the people who have experience know that you\u2019re not going to get rich and you\u2019re going to work your butt off,\u201d he said. \u201cThe hours are long and the pay is not great, and so they were smart enough to say, \u2018I don\u2019t want any part of this.\u2019\u201d\u201cAnd,\u201d he added, \u201cthere\u2019s a generation and a half now of people who don\u2019t even know what a newspaper is.\u201dWhat it is not, he said, is social media. \u201cFor someone to hold up a Facebook post as journalism is kind of an affront,\u201d he said.Journalism at The Gazette consists of keeping track of local government and the goings on here and in a few surrounding towns: With milk prices falling, for example, dairy farmers are banding together to increase their clout. The nearby town of Craftsbury, a Gazette reporter wrote, is \u201cjoining the 21st century\u201d with high-speed internet.Mr. Connelly says that he has also covered topics that some readers objected to, including a big bank scandal involving a local resident and the harassment of a transgender police officer by a town official.The paper, running 10 or 12 pages, is filled with the staples of community weeklies: local sports, calendars, birth announcements and obituaries, the police blotter and reviews of artistic endeavors. In last week\u2019s edition, one correspondent, Michael Bielawski, wrote five of the seven front-page stories.\u201cYou have to keep going back and become a familiar face to them, and then they begin to understand that we\u2019re a local business just like they are,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you have to spend four hours to get two ads, that\u2019s what you do.\u201dMr. Connelly takes a dim view of the headphone-wearing, phone-obsessed, plugged-in culture. So it is little surprise that The Gazette has avoided being available online.\u201cI don\u2019t believe in giving away my product,\u201d Mr. Connelly said. \u201cThat was one of the big mistakes newspapers made, because now you have people thinking it\u2019s free.\u201dIn his view, the hard copy of the paper fosters civic engagement in a way that a smartphone does not.\u201cWhen you pick up your paper, you may see a headline or a photograph that will grab your attention, and you\u2019ll say to the cashier or the person next to you, \u2018Did you see that?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt brings people together. It is a building block of democracy.\u201dNor is he impressed with social media; the anonymity of it, he said, can breed anarchy. By contrast, he prints letters to the editor only if they include the writer\u2019s signature, name, address and phone number.Mr. Connelly and his wife initially lived on the second floor of the Gazette building. Their son, Sawyer, 25, who works for a wildlife conservation group in Montana, wrote on the contest website his reminiscence of growing up at the paper.On production nights, he said, he would curl up under his mother\u2019s desk with the family dog \u201cand fall asleep amidst the sounds of keystrokes and the smell of coffee and ink.\u201dHe said that he and his father were unprepared to deal with his mother\u2019s death.

He yearned to photograph in Russia, but it was too expensive for his budget as a university student in his hometown, Geneva. Flights to Kiev were cheaper than to Moscow, and no visa was needed. He has returned to Ukraine dozens of times, and last year he moved to Kiev full time. While he did not make it to Russia in 2009, Russia, in a way, has come to him. Its annexation of Crimea and the war in eastern Ukraine have changed Ukraine. Mr. Ackermann covered the early days of the Maidan revolution but has so far stayed away from documenting the resulting war.  Instead, he said, he has  focused mostly on personal stories in Ukraine so he can \u00e2\u0080\u009cgo deeper and say something different\u00e2\u0080\u009d than many other photographers there. His main project has been photographing young people coming of age in Slavutich, a planned community for workers at the Chernobyl nuclear plant, built after the accident there in 1986. The surprisingly whimsical photo essay, three years in the making, has won Mr. Ackermann the R\u00c3\u00a9mi Ochlik award, named after the young French photojournalist who was killed with the reporter Marie Colvin while covering the Syrian uprising in Homs in 2012. Mr. Ackermann\u00e2\u0080\u0099s photos are on exhibit this week at the Visa Pour l\u00e2\u0080\u0099Image photo festival in Perpignan, France, and will receive the award there on Wednesday. Winning the award for a story that was not war-related, given Mr. Ochlik\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work, was unexpected, Mr. Ackermann said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a big surprise for me because I always associate Visa Pour l\u00e2\u0080\u0099Image with war photos or sad stories,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith this story I was trying to bring a more positive perspective to a story that we usually think about in a negative manner.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSlavutich was built from 1986 to 1988 by the Soviet Union in the immediate aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster. Its residents include people who had to leave their homes within a few miles of the site as well as others who moved to the area in search of work at the damaged plant.Mr. Ackermann originally went to Slavutich not because of its relationship to the Chernobyl accident but out of an interest in government-planned communities. Most cities develop organically over time as a result of economic, historic and geographic circumstances. Slavutich came into existence and was made to high standards because of the bad publicity over the failed response of the Soviet Union to the disaster, he said. He began photographing the architecture of Slavutich but found the images boring. He soon discovered that the average age in the city of about 25,000 is among the youngest of any community in the country. A chance encounter with a young woman, Yulia, gave him entree into a circle of young people in their early 20s who became the focus of the story. They were, he said, impulsive and lived passionately in the present, planning little for their future.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Ackermann said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto be hopeful after the events of the last 30 years in Ukraine \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the terrible economic crisis after the fall of communism, government corruption, the police violence during the second revolution and the Russian annexation of Crimea and the war.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMost had left Slavutich to go to college to study fields like computer programming, design or journalism, but returned after graduation. Getting a good job is difficult in Ukraine these days. For now, Mr. Ackermann\u00e2\u0080\u0099s subjects can find employment at Chernobyl but mainly as truck drivers, welders and mechanics.The young people he befriended spent a lot of time partying, and alcohol flowed freely, he said. What could be called field research, or perhaps gonzo journalism, led him to drink over 16 liters of vodka with them over the three-year course of his visits, he noted.One among the group took him to Slavutich\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cemetery to show him the burial sites of many of his young classmates. At the cemetery, Mr. Ackermann said, the young man told him that \u00e2\u0080\u009cmore people die here because of alcohol and drugs than radioactivity.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBy the end of three years, most of his subjects were working at the Chernobyl site. They were, however, not too worried about radiation because of what they described as strict exposure monitoring.The other working reactors at Chernobyl closed in 2000, and as the decommissioning and cleanup progress there will probably be less need for workers. After the plant is entombed next year, 2,500 more jobs may be lost.Although his young friends are somewhat passive in planning for their futures, Mr. Ackermann said, they are confident that things will somehow work out. Most have married and have families.They are, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbuilding their own future in a city that does not really have a future.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhile they may be fatalistic at times, Mr. Ackermann said, they also seem to \u00e2\u0080\u009clive a more carefree, intense life\u00e2\u0080\u009d with less caution than he did before arriving in Slavutich.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn Switzerland we are overinsured for everything and worry about every possible outcome at times,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBad things can always happen, but if you think too much about it you can become paralyzed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}
{"Headline": "France Has the Burkini Blues", "Date": "2016-08-18", "News": "Supported byIn 2004, an Australian woman of Lebanese descent, Aheda Zanetti, discovered a market niche. Troubled by the sight of her young niece trying to play netball in an unwieldy combination of hijab and team uniform, she decided to design something suitable for Muslim sensibilities that combined modesty and practicality. Soon after she did the same thing for Muslim women who wanted to swim at Sydney beaches \u2014 but not in bikinis.She founded a company, Ahiida, to produce the new attire, which included the \u201chijood\u201d \u2014 a synthesis of hijab and hood \u2014 and the \u201cburkini\u201d \u2014 an amalgam of burqa and bikini. In 2006, Zanetti trademarked the names \u201cburkini\u201d and \u201cburqini\u201d in Australia and elsewhere. The swimwear \u2014 two-piece, full-body, head-covering garments \u2014 took off. For many Muslim women the burkini solved a beach dilemma.Fast-forward a dozen years through a period of growing tension between Islam and the West to Cannes on the French C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, where the mayor this month banned use of burkinis. Cannes is just 15 miles from Nice, the site of a terrorist attack last month in which a man loyal to the Islamic State drove a truck into a festive crowd, killing 85 people.The ordinance of the Cannes mayor, David Lisnard, said: \u201cBeach attire that ostentatiously displays a religious affiliation, while France and places of worship are the target of terrorist acts, is likely to create risks to public order.\u201dLisnard\u2019s position \u2014 adopted by the authorities in a few other resort towns \u2014 has now been backed by Manuel Valls, the French prime minister. He told the newspaper La Provence this week that, \u201cThe burkini is not a new range of swimwear, a fashion. It is the expression of a political project, a counter-society, based notably on the enslavement of women.\u201dValls said that, \u201cIf we want to construct an Islam of France compatible with our values, our liberties and male-female equality, then Islam must, as other religions have done, accept discretion in the manifestation of its religious convictions.\u201d He added, \u201cIn this very particular period where we suffer terrorist attacks in the name of a delinquent Islam, all citizens must assume their responsibilities.\u201dA number of factors have turned France into the epicenter of the clash between extremist Islam and Western societies. They include the presence of Western Europe\u2019s largest Muslim community, French participation in conflicts from the Middle East to Mali, the tensions deriving from France\u2019s troubled colonial past (notably in Algeria), and, perhaps most of all, the Republic\u2019s firm doctrine of la\u00efcit\u00e9, or secularism, designed to subsume all ethnic, racial, religious and other differences into French citizenship.Valls said that secularism was not the negation of religion but the protection of everyone\u2019s right to believe \u2014 or not believe. In practice, however, France\u2019s roughly 5 million Muslims have felt targeted because la\u00efcit\u00e9 has mainly translated of late into laws banning head scarves in state schools and face-covering veils in public. The Collective Against Islamophobia in France has said it will file a legal complaint against the Cannes ordinance.A couple of points must be made here. It is unacceptable that some Muslim communities in Europe enjoy the freedoms of the democracies they live in without accepting the responsibility of upholding the basic values of those societies. After terrorist attacks committed in the name of Islam from Britain to Belgium to Germany to France, it cannot be that imams in European mosques preach hatred against the West or portray the liberty and equality of women as debauchery and prostitution. The French government has rightly expelled 82 preachers of such views who had been living in France.Leaders of European Muslim communities \u2014 the many Muslims who have enjoyed success and integration in Europe \u2014 need to stand up day after day and declare, loud and clear, that with the fruits of freedom come the obligations of tolerant citizenship. Paris was not built on backwardness or barbarism or misogyny. Its luminous appeal to all humanity stems from the Enlightenment. The French state, in turn, like other states, must recommit itself to combating prejudice against Muslims.That said, it is also unacceptable to ban Zanetti\u2019s burkini from beaches. A burkini is not in itself \u201ca political project,\u201d \u201ca counter-society\u201d or a symbol of women\u2019s enslavement, as Valls argued. No, it is a choice of dress reflecting a religious belief protected under the French Constitution. If anything, it is the counter-bikini.Often the choice to wear one has been imposed through forms of male domination sanctioned by certain readings of Islam and pervasive in societies like Saudi Arabia, but equally it may reflect a woman\u2019s independently embraced identity. That is not for officials to decide. Inside the burkini lurk many different women\u2019s journeys.Zanetti told Le Monde that she would like to ask a question: \u201cDo French mayors and politicians want to ban the burkini, or just Muslims?\u201d From the distant fastness of Australia that\u2019s a sharp, easy jibe. The French reality is far more difficult, requiring outreach, restraint and good sense from all sides.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Instagram Posts May Have Escalated Fatal Standoff, Police Say", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA police standoff in Randallstown, Md., on Monday in which a 23-year-old woman with a shotgun was killed after the police say she had been encouraged by her online followers to defy their orders has highlighted an unexpected role of social media in violent encounters.During the standoff, which lasted several hours, videos from inside the apartment were posted to the Instagram account of the woman, Korryn Gaines, 23, whose 5-year-old son was also in the home, according to the Baltimore County Police Department.The police said Ms. Gaines had repeatedly pointed her shotgun at officers, at least once while her son was in her arms. At one point, she said she would kill the officers if they did not leave, the police said. An officer fired once at Ms. Gaines, and she fired back, the police said. Then officers fired three shots, killing Ms. Gaines. Her son also sustained injuries in the crossfire, though they are not considered to be life-threatening.But in the case of Ms. Gaines, according to the police, it may have escalated the encounter.While the standoff with Ms. Gaines continued, the police in Baltimore County submitted a request to Facebook \u2014 which owns Instagram \u2014 to deactivate but not delete her accounts. Facebook cooperated, temporarily making her Facebook and Instagram posts inaccessible during the standoff.\u201cIt\u2019s key for these trained negotiators to be able to interact with the subject without distraction, without interference from the outside,\u201d Elise Armacost, a Baltimore County police spokeswoman, said at a news conference. The episode highlights Facebook\u2019s increasingly complicated role in documenting violence, and in some cases, its active place in the middle of it.Before the shots were fired, the Instagram posts caught the police\u2019s attention.\u201cThe police,\u201d the boy responded.\u201cAnd what are they trying to do?\u201d she said.\u201cThey trying to kill us,\u201d he said.The police said some of the comments people left on the posts encouraged her to defy orders to surrender peacefully, complicating the negotiations.A team of Facebook moderators decides what violent content can remain but will take it down if it appears to glorify violence. Though the videos on Ms. Gaines\u2019s account were not live, one of the videos was taken down for violating Facebook\u2019s community standards related to threats of physical harm, the company said.The police were also serving an arrest warrant on her boyfriend, Kareem Courtney, 39, who the police said was wanted on an assault charge. He fled the apartment with a 1-year-old child but was arrested, the police said.After Ms. Gaines refused to allow the police to enter, an officer obtained a key, the police said. The officers found Ms. Gaines on the floor holding a shotgun and her son, the police said. They called for backup, and the standoff began.At a news conference on Tuesday, the police chief, James Johnson, said officers showed restraint throughout the standoff despite officers\u2019 being in danger.\u201cThe entire time, throughout the afternoon, she would repeatedly point the weapon at our personnel, and they maintained firearms discipline throughout,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Several tourists suffered bruises.\u201cI was entering Old Town Square from a far corner and heard gunshots,\u201d said Andrea Steinova, a Prague resident. \u201cThen I saw a group of about 40 people, some of them yelling in Hebrew, running toward me.

Other people taunted the protesters; one woman shouted at the men, \u201cXenophobe! Xenophobe!\u201dMr. Konvicka, an entomologist at University of South Bohemia in Ceske Budejovice, in the country\u2019s south, founded a group called \u201cWe don\u2019t want Islam in the Czech Republic.\u201d He had called the protest \u201cThe Occupation of Prague\u201d and scheduled it for Sunday, the 48th anniversary of the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968.In a telephone interview, Mr. Konvicka said it was obvious that the mock attack was a stunt, adding, \u201cThe police checked our air guns and even counted how many bearded guys were in our group, to make sure we didn\u2019t deviate from what we told City Hall we would do.\u201dA spokesman for the Prague police, Tomas Hulan, said the department had no power to ban the event as it had been approved by City Hall.

Aspiring models, third-tier reality show stars, impossible-to-place actors, YouTube vloggers and viral news subjects can now all curry coverage just by replenishing their social media accounts with photos of their babies, their butts or both. These are people you\u2019ve probably never heard of \u2014 or have a nagging suspicion you might have, but don\u2019t quite know why.It used to be that the only way a non-recognizable person could land in the pages of the glossy celebrity magazines was to lose 100 pounds, serve as some heartwarming testimony to good-old-fashioned American values, or be murdered. But in the early aughts, the magazines started diversifying their coverage of Hollywood\u2019s leading Jens and Bens with stories on the romantic dupes and plastic surgery nightmares of reality television. Now, as the rise of social media demolishes the leverage that celebrity tabloids once had over their most famous subjects, the gossip industry keeps defining celebrity downward. (After all, no magazine can match the reach of Taylor Swift\u2019s more than 90 million Instagram fans or Kim Kardashian West\u2019s 47 million Twitter followers.)On a recent episode, they take on Brittany Farrar, the ex-girlfriend of Aaron Rodgers\u2019s little brother, Jordan Rodgers (who is now dating the \u201cBachelorette\u201d star JoJo Fletcher), who recently accused Jordan of cheating in a series of Instagram posts. \u201cWhy are we still hearing about her?\u201d Ms. Weber asked. Mr. Finger replied: \u201cBecause she wants us \u2014 she did her due diligence in making sure we talked about her.\u201d And just like that: A Who was born.Time Inc. has started a kind of general-interest publication on the internet-famous just as the internet has atomized celebrity into a zillion tiny fandoms. Few people are typically energized by the generic category of \u201csocial media figure.\u201d They get their kicks by closely following a select few of their favorite stars, the stars\u2019 friends and family, and a network of (often infighting) fans. The obsessive monitoring of all these channels drums up sufficient drama to create an enduring story line, even if only a few thousand people can manage to follow along. Plus, the setup provides fans the illusion of power in determining which Whos become Thems (Blac Chyna, a rap video vixen engaged to Rob Kardashian, is on her way toward top-level recognition) and which seem destined to fade into permanent obscurity (I\u2019m sorry, Sarah Wright Olsen).But these modern fandoms produce grist for non-fans, too. There\u2019s something deliciously surreal about monitoring the online movements of the barely famous, a class of people who are just unpolished, desperate and savvy enough to act mad, sloppy and sexy. The fact that publications like People and Us Weekly are covering it with a straight face adds another absurd layer.Besides, these people are assaulting our social feeds every day whether we like it or not. Outlets like The Shade Room and \u201cWho? Weekly\u201d have managed to extract bits of hilarity, delight and shame out of that arid media landscape. They have intuited what the traditional tabloids don\u2019t quite get: The pursuit of celebrity has emerged as a grand tabloid narrative in and of itself.Advertisement"}

The global citizens of big cities like London and Manchester who voted Remain were aghast that anyone out there in Lincolnshire (let alone a majority nationwide) could think differently, in the same way as the global citizens of New York or Los Angeles can\u2019t see Trump\u2019s appeal to tens of millions of Americans.The uncomfortable truth about the Trump campaign is that, like the Brexit campaign, it is perfectly timed to ride a mood of popular revolt \u2014 against neoliberal economics, against the bankers who emerged with impunity from the 2008 financial meltdown, against what Farage called \u201cglobal corporatism,\u201d against seemingly uncontrolled immigration, and against the politicians behind growing workplace precariousness and a pervasive sense of personal control lost to impersonal forces.One way to view Trump is that only his personal failings \u2014 his bullying, his petulance, his egomania, his ignorance, his inconsistency, his mendacity, his racism, his hair-trigger temper, his arrogance, his disorganization and his misogyny \u2014 stand in the way of his emerging as the logical victor in an anti-status quo, pro-change election that produced in Bernie Sanders the other political phenomenon of 2016.Because Hillary Clinton, as a symbol of dynastic entitlement (albeit a female one), is such an easy target for an anti-establishment movement, she is particularly vulnerable to the forces that have produced Trump and Brexit.He went on: \u201cOne of the reasons why the left has failed to emerge as the leader of the new mood of working-class disillusionment is that most social democratic parties became, in varying degrees, disciples of neoliberalism and uber-globalization.\u201d The most extreme expressions of this, he noted, were New Labour in Britain and the Democratic Party, led respectively by Tony Blair and Bill Clinton.Of course, those political movements also produced great prosperity and optimism in their moment. But the moment has passed. The pendulum has swung. Inequality has risen to intolerable levels.\u201cIf the little people, if the real people, if the ordinary decent people are prepared to stand up and fight for what they believe in, we can overcome the big banks, we can overcome the multinationals,\u201d Farage declared with Trump looking on approvingly.They are politicians delivering ugly messages \u2014 explicit and implicit. Theirs is the last hate-filled stand of the white man in societies that globalization has irrevocably changed in composition and color. They are self-centered and cynical, manipulating resentment with half-truths and untruths, accommodating the loony extremist right.Farage has already done great damage to Britain. But if there is one thing that Americans can learn from him, it is that we live in an age where the candidate of disruption rides a powerful wave.Advertisement"}

Trump. To complicate matters, Mr. Trump may well be the most media-savvy presidential candidate since John F. Kennedy.It\u2019s easy to speculate that back in the day an Edward R. Murrow might have taken out Mr. Trump just as he did Joseph McCarthy, but what if McCarthy had had access to Twitter, Facebook and all the other means of unfiltered communication directly to the public, as Mr. Trump has now?In defining the problem with McCarthy, Mr. Murrow might just as well have been referring to Mr. Trump when he alluded to a passage in Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d: \u201cThe actions of the junior senator from Wisconsin have caused alarm and dismay among our allies abroad, and given considerable comfort to our enemies. And whose fault is that? Not really his. He didn\u2019t create this situation of fear, he merely exploited it \u2014 and rather successfully. Cassius was right: \u2018The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves.\u2019 \u201dKudos to Jim Rutenberg for his thoughtful and pointed analysis of the challenges of covering someone like Mr. Trump objectively. And thank God for bona fide journalists perceptive enough to openly recognize and discuss the difficulties of doing so while negotiating the treacherous war zone that our political process has become. GREG JOSEPHSun City, Ariz.To the Editor:Your article conceals an unfortunate reality of much of the contemporary media and liberalism: a basic distrust of democracy. Through the process of democratic elections, a significant plurality of those voting in the Republican primaries selected Mr. Trump as their preferred candidate for president. This was democracy in action.If objective journalists truly believed in the fundamental principle of a democratic form of government, they would be respecting this choice and would be performing their job of objectively and fairly presenting the facts concerning both candidates and letting the voters decide. But as this article makes clear, many journalists cannot bring themselves to be fair, balanced and objective. Instead, they believe that they know better than the people, and are unwilling to provide just the facts and let the electorate decide.CHRISTOPHER HODGKINFriday Harbor, Wash.To the Editor:Journalists have bent over backward to seem \u201cbalanced\u201d at the expense of objective truth for far too long. As long as it comes out of a prominent politician\u2019s mouth, they report and repeat it as if it\u2019s a reasonable point of view, regardless of the evidence (or lack thereof). It gives credence to self-serving fabrications like \u201cwe don\u2019t know if humans are contributing to climate change\u201d and \u201cvoter fraud is a serious crisis.\u201dNow Donald Trump has raised the stakes even further. Don\u2019t legitimize his lying, ignorance, cruelty and recklessness just because he\u2019s one of two presidential candidates. Measure him against fact, evidence, precedent and basic human decency, and call it like it is.JUSTIN WARNERJackson Heights, QueensTo the Editor:The sheer volume of coverage of Donald Trump is completely out of proportion to the seriousness of his ideas or frankly to the newsworthy value of the stories written about him. Day in and day out The Times devotes at least one and often multiple front-page stories to Mr. Trump. Often there is not a single story about Hillary Clinton.Why are his tweets news, while her policy statements are not? It matters relatively little that the Trump articles are often critical. His latest outrageous remark is the story of the day \u2014 and the story of the next day is whether or not it was all that outrageous. One wonders whether The Times is simply trying to sell papers by printing flashy copy or is trying to inform the public about issues that actually matter to their lives.IRWIN SANDLERPhoenixTo the Editor:I do not think Jim Rutenberg need worry that we do not get enough negative coverage on Hillary Clinton. I have heard as much about her trust numbers, Benghazi and her supposedly egregious lies about emails to last a lifetime.Please stop thinking that Hillary Clinton is not being raked over the coals for her mistakes enough compared with Donald Trump.

As of Wednesday, the deaths appeared to be concentrated in four communities: at least 86 in the towns of Amatrice and Accumoli, in Lazio, and at least 32 in Marche, in the village of Arquata del Tronto and the hamlet of Pescara del Tronto.On Thursday, the Italian Civil Protection Department said 241 people were confirmed dead, and hundreds more injured.Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, speaking Wednesday from Rieti, a city in Lazio near the epicenter, likened the affected communities to \u201ca family that has been hit but won\u2019t stop.\u201d He vowed that the government would quickly start to rebuild, noting widespread anger over the long delays in rebuilding after the 2009 quake. \u201cReconstruction is what will allow this community to live and to restart,\u201d he said.Immacolata Postiglione, the head of the emergency unit for the Civil Protection Department, said on Wednesday that more than 1,000 people were expected to spend the night in four camps being set up in the area.

In the three months leading up to Nov. 25, 2014, the hashtag averaged fewer than 1,500 daily mentions. In the three months after, it averaged more than 30,000.The Pew study cut off at the end of March of this year, but the team behind the report later conducted a supplemental analysis covering two weeks in July when two black men were separately killed by police and eight police officers were killed in a pair of targeted attacks.What they found was a tremendous surge in the mentions of #BlackLivesMatter and #AllLivesMatter.By July 8, the hashtag soared to more than 1.1 million mentions. On that same day, #AllLivesMatter appeared 189,000 times on Twitter \u2014 matching the record for #BlackLivesMatter during the entire earlier thousand-day study period.The July flurry of activity is notable not only for the level of discussion around the hashtag, but also for how the tone of the conversation changed, according to Pew.Over the course of the 1,000-day study period, 38 percent of #BlackLivesMatter mentions were positive, compared with 11 percent negative, according to a Pew sentiment analysis. The hashtag was used neutrally 12 percent of the time. (The remaining references fell into an \u201cother\u201d category.)And in the days leading up to the Dallas shooting, the tone was even more supportive: 87 percent of posts mentioning #BlackLivesMatter did so in a positive light, with just 11 percent of mentions appearing negative from July 5 to July 7.But that quickly and drastically shifted, with support falling to 28 percent and opposition rising to 39 percent in the 10 days after the Dallas shooting.\u201cWe really saw that shift overnight,\u201d Ms. Anderson said. \u201cIt really shows you where current events can drive the conversation on social media and also change the tenor of conversation there, as well.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But in Israeli eyes, Palestinian leaders starting with Yasir Arafat, the father of Palestinian nationalism who helped found Fatah in 1959, have had a habit of saying one thing in Arabic and another in English.Mr. Abbas, who succeeded Mr. Arafat, has repeatedly said he supports nonviolent resistance against the Israeli occupation. But Fatah has historically championed armed resistance as a central tenet of its doctrine for the liberation of the Palestinian people.Fatah is now a large and unwieldy movement, and its activists often make statements that do not reflect Mr. Abbas\u2019s position.\u201cPresident Abbas\u2019s party boasts about committing mass murder and yet it is called \u2018moderate\u2019 by many,\u201d said David Keyes, a spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. \u201cImagine if Palestinian leaders spent their time praising coexistence instead of terror.\u201dHusam Zomlot, the strategic affairs adviser to Mr. Abbas, first questioned whether the Facebook page was official, and then said it was probably the work of some \u201chot-blooded youths.\u201dMr. Zomlot said that Israeli officials frequently wrote incendiary Facebook posts, and that Fatah\u2019s concerns were elsewhere.\u201cI\u2019m from Fatah and one of its leaders,\u201d he said. \u201cWe present a complete political platform, and the most important thing is to end the Israeli occupation.\u201dThe comments on the official Fatah Facebook page came in the context of coming local and municipal elections that are expected to be held on Oct. 8.The prospect of the elections is already whipping up strong emotions. They will be the first to be held in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in a decade since Fatah, the mainstream, secularist party that has long dominated the Palestine Liberation Organization, suffered an embarrassing defeat at the hands of Hamas, the Islamist militant group, in legislative elections in 2006.A year later Hamas seized control of the Gaza Strip, routing Fatah\u2019s forces there and confining Mr. Abbas\u2019s influence \u2014 and that of his Western-backed Palestinian Authority, which is largely staffed by Fatah loyalists \u2014 to parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.The West Bank and Gaza have since been divided by a bitter schism. Hamas, considered a terrorist organization by Israel, the United States and the European Union, refuses to recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist and has battled Israel several times in recent years.The coming elections are seen as an important barometer of public sentiment in both the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Fatah activists appear particularly nervous about the elections, because Hamas is widely seen by Palestinians as the less corrupt and more efficient party.Advertisement"}

A copy of the report was obtained by The New York Times.The critique is the latest example of the Obama administration\u2019s aggressive push for police reforms in cities where young African-American men have died at the hands of law enforcement.The findings, to be released Wednesday, are the first formal step toward the Justice Department\u2019s reaching a settlement with Baltimore \u2014 known as a \u201cconsent decree\u201d \u2014 in which police practices would be overhauled under the oversight of a federal judge. The department started the inquiry at the invitation of Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake.To show how officers disproportionately stopped black pedestrians, the report cited the example of a black man in his mid-50s who was stopped 30 times in less than four years. None of the stops led to a citation or criminal charge. Black residents, the report said, accounted for 95 percent of the 410 individuals stopped at least 10 times in the five and a half years of data reviewed.The most pronounced racial disparities were in arrests for the most discretionary offenses: For example, 91 percent of those arrested solely for \u201cfailure to obey\u201d or \u201ctrespassing\u201d were African-American, even though the city is 63 percent black, the report found.In one telling anecdote from the report, a shift commander provided officers with boilerplate language on how to write up trespassing arrest reports of people found near housing projects. The template contained an automatic description of the arrestee: \u201cA BLACK MALE.\u201d\u201cThe supervisor\u2019s template thus presumes that individuals arrested for trespassing will be African-American,\u201d the report stated, describing the sort of detentions the language was intended to facilitate as \u201cfacially unconstitutional.\u201dThe report indicated that the frequency of arrests without probable cause was reflected in the fact that booking supervisors and prosecutors had declined to file charges, after arrests by their own officers, more than 11,000 times since 2010.Two weeks ago, Maryland prosecutors dropped charges against the last of six officers charged in the April 2015 death of Mr. Gray, who sustained a fatal spinal cord injury while in custody. With that, Baltimore joined a growing list of cities where police-involved deaths sparked outrage, and even riots, yet no one was held accountable in court.While no consent decree has been reached, the report states that the city and the Justice Department have agreed in principle to identify \u201ccategories of reforms the parties agree must be taken to remedy the violations of the Constitution and federal law described in this report.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think at this point, it\u2019s about justice for Freddie Gray anymore,\u201d said Ray Kelly, a director of the No Boundaries Coalition, a West Baltimore group that provided its own report on police abuses to the Justice Department. \u201cNow it\u2019s about justice for our community, for our people.\u201dBaltimore is among nearly two dozen cities that the Obama administration has investigated after they were accused of widespread unconstitutional policing. Using its broad latitude to enforce civil rights laws, the Justice Department has demanded wholesale change in how cities conduct policing. In several cities, including Seattle; Cleveland; and Ferguson, Mo., those investigations began in the aftermath of a high-profile death that sparked protests and in some cases riots.Police chiefs, prosecutors and experts say the investigations have forced cities to address longstanding, entrenched issues far beyond the targeted cities.\u201cChiefs are constantly looking at these reports, not just to learn lessons and best practices from each other, but also what pitfalls we can avoid,\u201d said Scott Thomson, the police chief in Camden, N.J., who is also the president of the Police Executive Research Forum.But court-ordered reform can take years, which does little to ease the frustration of activists who say that police officers too often go unpunished for deadly encounters with unarmed people.A Justice Department investigation into the practices of the Baltimore police department found \"reasonable cause to believe that the BPD engages in a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the Constitution or federal law.\"Dayvon Love, 29, a founder of the Baltimore advocacy group Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle, said that changes would come only when civilians have a say in whether officers should face punishment. Mr. Love described frustrating meetings with Justice Department officials \u2014 including Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch.\u201cI was very skeptical and not really that enthused about meeting with them,\u201d Mr. Love said. At one point, he said, he asked Ms. Lynch what she could do to change state law and give civilians more power over the police. \u201cShe said what I figured she\u2019d say, which is that from her position as attorney general, she can\u2019t really do anything about it.\u201dThe Supreme Court has given police officers wide latitude in how they can use deadly force, which makes prosecuting them difficult, even in the killing of unarmed people. For the Justice Department to charge an officer with a federal crime, the bar is even higher. Prosecutors must show that the officer willfully violated someone\u2019s civil rights.In Baltimore, black residents have been complaining for years of systematic abuse by the department. When the city\u2019s top prosecutor, Marilyn Mosby, failed to get any convictions in Mr. Gray\u2019s death, many in the city\u2019s poorest African-American neighborhoods were not surprised.After the 1991 beating of Rodney King in Los Angeles, Congress gave the Justice Department the power to investigate police departments for patterns of civil rights violations. The Obama administration has used that authority more aggressively than any other. Prosecutors are enforcing consent decrees on police departments in 14 cities.\u201cWe tend to confront systemic problems only when forced to by seemingly extraordinary events,\u201d Vanita Gupta, the Justice Department\u2019s top civil rights prosecutor, said last year.In Seattle, the investigation followed an officer\u2019s shooting of a Native American woodcarver in 2010. The shooting was ruled unjustified, but prosecutors said they could not meet the legal standard to file charges. The federal authorities, however, found a pattern of excessive force and ordered the Police Department to provide better training and oversight. In recent years, the Justice Department has held Seattle up as an example of how cities can best respond to scathing investigations.The report is sure to fuel a broader debate on aggressive policing practices, as it blames much of Baltimore\u2019s woes on so-called \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policies adopted in the late 1990s. They were aimed at anyone on the streets whom officers viewed as suspect, making heavy use of stop-and-frisk and other confrontation techniques.But the approach, the report found, \u201cled to repeated violations of the constitutional and statutory rights, further eroding the community\u2019s trust in the police.\u201dWhile Baltimore officials have sought to curb the most extreme zero-tolerance policies, the legacy of the strategy continues to vex the department.One example the report cited was a police sergeant who recently posted on Facebook that the \u201csolution to the murder rate is easy: flex cuffs and a line at\u201d the central booking office, made up of people arrested on charges of loitering.An article on Wednesday about a Justice Department report on the Baltimore Police Department misstated, in some editions, part of the name of the organization led by Scott Thompson, who commented on the report. It is the Police Executive Research Forum (not Foundation). The article also misstated the surname of the president of the research forum in some editions. He is Scott Thomson, not Thompson.Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Matt Apuzzo reported from Washington, and Richard A. Oppel Jr. from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Breitbart Rises From Outlier to Potent Voice in Campaign", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreitbart News has arrived.Known for gleefully bashing the old Republican establishment, Breitbart now finds itself at the center of the party\u2019s presidential campaign. Its longtime chairman, Stephen K. Bannon, was named campaign chief by Mr. Trump, whose nationalist, conspiracy-minded message routinely mirrors the Breitbart worldview.On Facebook, it rivals news organizations like The Washington Post and Yahoo, and it has challenged conservative favorites like Fox News in its influence on the campaign, if not in size of audience.For Mrs. Clinton, it was a strategic attack that linked Mr. Trump to leading avatars of the hard-line right. But among Breitbart\u2019s ideologically driven journalists, her remarks were taken as validation.\u201cI\u2019ll play it cool, but not that cool: It was a big moment,\u201d the site\u2019s editor in chief, Alexander Marlow, 30, said in an interview on Friday. \u201cA major presidential candidate engaging us like that, and calling us out directly, was quite thrilling.\u201dThe rise of Breitbart News, founded a decade ago by the provocateur Andrew Breitbart, who died in 2012, is an unlikely outcome for a small, decentralized news outlet with a penchant for infighting. But it remains an outsize source of controversy \u2014 for liberals and even many traditional conservatives \u2014 over material that has been called misogynist, xenophobic and racist.The site refers to \u201cmigrant rape gangs\u201d in Europe, and was among the first news outlets to disseminate unsubstantiated rumors that Mrs. Clinton was in ill health. Its writers often vilify the Black Lives Matter movement, emphasizing what they call a scourge of \u201cblack-on-black crime,\u201d and described \u201cyoung Muslims in the West\u201d as the world\u2019s \u201cticking time bomb.\u201dBefore Mr. Breitbart died, the site had gained notoriety by championing the Tea Party movement and publicizing an undercover video that led to the closing of Acorn, the community organizing group. It also posted misleading footage of Shirley Sherrod, a black Department of Agriculture official, who was fired for seeming to express resentment toward a white farmer; the White House later apologized.Last month, Milo Yiannopoulos, the site\u2019s tech editor, was banned from Twitter after inspiring a sustained online harassment campaign against the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d actor Leslie Jones. Reports surfaced this week about domestic violence charges filed against Mr. Bannon stemming from a divorce in 1996.Supporters say it is the site\u2019s willingness to embrace viewpoints considered far outside the bounds of respectable political discourse that is the very source of its success \u2014 in the same way that Mr. Trump\u2019s more extreme proposals, like banning Muslims from entering the country, galvanized the Republican primary electorate.And like Mr. Trump, Breitbart excels on social media. Last month, it ranked as the 11th most popular site on Facebook, according to statistics from the social analytics firm NewsWhip. A year ago, its Facebook page had fewer than a million followers; now, it has more than 2.3 million.Breitbart, which is privately owned, has declined to release revenue figures. The site appears to be backed by Mr. Breitbart\u2019s estate; its chief executive, Larry Solov; and the family of Robert Mercer, a wealthy conservative donor and Trump supporter, according to corporate documents and two people briefed on the company\u2019s finances.For Mr. Marlow, the editor in chief, the site\u2019s success comes from attracting an underserved segment of conservatives \u2014 opponents of immigration and free trade who did not see their views reflected in other outlets.In online conservative news media, Mr. Marlow said, \u201cThe focus has not been on the traditional left-versus-right dichotomy. It\u2019s become populism and nationalism versus globalism.\u201dHe said that Fox News, long a favored venue for the Republican establishment, had lost its feel for the grass-roots right, saying the network harps on older controversies, like the attack on the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, and that its owner, Rupert Murdoch, is unwilling to criticize open immigration.10 Photos\u201cFox is critical of Trump and a lot of the values that his voters stand for,\u201d Mr. Marlow said. \u201cA lot of conservatives feel betrayed.\u201d (Fox News has drawn its highest-ever ratings amid this year\u2019s campaign, and Mr. Trump routinely appears on the network. \u201cWe will let our record-breaking year speak for itself,\u201d the network said in a statement on Friday.)For those who track hate groups, Breitbart\u2019s success is particularly alarming.\u201cBreitbart in the last year or so has consistently picked up themes coming from the alt-right,\u201d said Heidi Beirich, the director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center, using a nickname for a loosely affiliated online movement that includes hard-line nationalists and many supporters of Mr. Trump.Ms. Beirich said that Breitbart came to her attention because she found that white supremacist websites, like The Daily Stormer, were increasingly linking to its coverage. \u201cTo people in the alt-right, who have basically been maligned and haven\u2019t been part of the political system at all, this is a big, big deal,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cTheir views are finally in the mainstream.\u201dIt was this development that prompted aides to Mrs. Clinton to consider whether she should explicitly call out Breitbart to voters.\u201cWe think it\u2019s important that people understand what Trump stands for, and what these groups stand for, and what it means that he echoes them,\u201d said Glen Caplin, a Clinton campaign spokesman.Not everyone affiliated with Breitbart is pleased with the site\u2019s recent turn. Several longtime staff members quit earlier this year, saying that Mr. Bannon had turned a website founded on anti-authoritarian grounds into a de facto propaganda outlet for Mr. Trump.\u201cI don\u2019t think it would be Andrew Breitbart\u2019s proudest moment to be called the foundation for white supremacy on the internet,\u201d Ben Shapiro, one of the editors who resigned, said on Friday.Did Mr. Shapiro ever expect to see Breitbart, which began as a no-frills aggregator of wire stories, prominently featured in a speech by a major-party presidential candidate?\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have surprised me if a Democratic presidential candidate did that,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cI\u2019m just surprised that she\u2019s not wrong.\u201dAdvertisement"}

A second question in the referendum, on whether a junta-appointed Senate would have a role in choosing the prime minister, was endorsed by 58.1 percent and opposed by 41.9 percent. An official tally is expected by Wednesday.The measure was also opposed in the far south, where there is a Muslim majority and a long-running separatist movement.\u201cThe junta said this would be a part of the national reconciliation, but I would not buy into it,\u201d said Pavin Chachavalpongpun, an associate professor of political science and international relations at Kyoto University in Japan. \u201cYou can see the clear division between those who agree and those who disagree.\u201dThe authorities banned campaigning against the proposed constitution, and several opponents of the draft document were arrested during the campaign.Ms. Yingluck called the outcome a step back.\u201cI am not surprised about the referendum results, as there was no opportunity to fully express opinions or criticize the content of the constitution draft,\u201d she wrote on Facebook on Monday.\u201cHowever, I am so sorry and lament for the country, as it\u2019s a move backward to use a constitution that seems to be democratic but is not truly democratic,\u201d she added.The junta said the draft was intended to reduce the possibility of coups, but critics said that it would diminish the role of democracy in the political system.Thailand\u2019s strict l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 laws make it a crime to insult the monarchy, an offense that includes a surprising number of activities.In comments after the vote, the junta chief and prime minister, Gen.

{"Headline": "Even Uber Couldn\u2019t Bridge the China Divide", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtTravis Kalanick, the co-founder and chief executive of the ride-hailing giant Uber, often defended his eagerness to risk billions on winning the Chinese market with a simple question: If you have a chance to become Amazon and Alibaba at the same time, why not try?The implication was simple. Over the last couple of decades, Amazon, Facebook, Google and other American technology giants have each followed a similar script for world domination. Like an imperial armada rolling out from North America\u2019s West Coast, these companies would try to establish beachheads on every other continent.But when American giants tried to enter the waters of China, the world\u2019s largest internet market, the armada invariably ran aground.Plagued by opaque and ever-shifting regulations and a culturally abstruse way of doing business, American companies fell to a series of local giants. Instead of Google, Baidu. Instead of Facebook, WeChat, owned by the giant Tencent. And instead of Amazon, Alibaba.That has left us with a divide: Today, there is the Chinese internet, and there is the internet of the rest of the world. A network seen in its early days as a tool to foster financial and political unity across a fragmented planet has irrevocably cleaved into two completely separate spheres.Entrepreneurs across the globe can choose to win in China or the rest of the world. You can be Alibaba or you can be Amazon. You can be Uber or you can be Didi. But you can\u2019t be both. Given the rising Chinese market and increasing tension over the role of American tech firms in the rest of the globe, the gulf between the two sides promises to become one of the most important factors in determining the shape of global tech innovation.How exactly might the war play out? In some ways, being at the mercy of two poles of internet leadership could be good for citizens of planet Earth. In emerging markets like India, the Middle East and parts of Africa and South America, the giants of China and the United States are increasingly investing billions to compete for local customers in e-commerce, social networking, ride sharing and other markets.\u201cAmazon is increasingly making its own branded products, taking on Procter & Gamble and others, and also getting into the logistics business, and shipping, and everything else,\u201d Mr. Clark said. \u201cBut Alibaba is a marketplace that doesn\u2019t hold inventory and describes themselves as helping local merchants \u2014 so maybe there\u2019s some argument that Alibaba could serve as a counter globally to Amazon.\u201d\u201cIn that way it could be like the Yalta Conference,\u201d said Mr. Clark, referring to the 1945 meeting in which the victors of World War II determined the postwar geopolitical order.\u201cThe barrels that will be thrown at you when you\u2019re trying to do business in China will just never stop,\u201d said Mark Natkin, the managing director of Marbridge Consulting, an advisory firm based in Beijing. \u201cYou\u2019ll constantly be above one barrel or recovering from jumping one, and as you\u2019re dusting yourself off you look down the road and here comes the next one.\u201dCompared with previous failures, Uber seemed to do everything right in China. It set up a separate company, Uber China, which had a buy-in from local investors, including from a local giant, Baidu. It hired many local experts, and worked closely with the national government to foster friendly relations.Insiders say Mr. Kalanick was also personally invested in the deal. He visited China eight times in the last year and a half, and became something of a tech star in the Chinese media.Publicly Mr. Kalanick had insisted he was fighting for total victory in China. But he must have known that Uber would always struggle to achieve dominance, given the emerging centrality of ride-sharing to the future of infrastructure in China. Still, even if he failed to win everything in China, investing early in the country seemed too big to skip.For now, it\u2019s especially delicious frosting. The $2 billion Uber spent tackling China is now worth about $7 billion in the new merged entity; if Didi does become one of China\u2019s largest tech companies, the value of Uber\u2019s stake in China could rise geometrically, making the firm much more attractive in a potential initial public offering. Pulling out of China also frees up Uber to invest more in other markets \u2014 India and Indonesia are big targets \u2014 as well as expand its expertise in core technological initiatives like mapping data and self-driving cars.But if spending big to tackle China ultimately works out for Uber, it will be an anomaly, and certainly not a model for other American tech giants.\u201cThe ride-sharing market is one the few markets where the upside is big enough to justify going in,\u201d Mr. Thompson said. \u201cFor most other companies, going into China is still going to be nothing but pain.\u201dEmail: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}

When she signed up for a citizens academy held by the local police department, she and her husband were among 35 people hoping to learn more about law enforcement tactics.During the training on Tuesday, which drew community leaders, business employees and even the chief of the Punta Gorda Police Department, Ms. Knowlton was selected to participate in a \u201cshoot/don\u2019t shoot\u201d role-play exercise. But the session went terribly wrong.Ms. Knowlton, 73, was accidentally shot and killed by a police officer, according to the authorities.The police chief, Thomas P. Lewis, said at a news conference on Wednesday that Ms. Knowlton had been killed by an officer who fired a revolver that had been used before in the role-play exercise intended to teach people how to make decisions when confronted with lethal force.The chief, who said he had been present at the time of the shooting, did not address why the officer, whom the department later identified as Officer Lee Coel, used live rounds in the training session.On Wednesday, the Police Department said in a statement that Officer Coel joined the department in 2014 and frequently participated in shoot/don\u2019t shoot programs. Chief Lewis said that Officer Coel was placed on administrative leave and that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement would conduct an independent investigation.\u201cThe Police Department is always open to criticism. Bottom line is we don\u2019t always get it right,\u201d the chief said at the time.Police departments across the United States, from Houston to Evanston, Ill., host some version of citizens academy programs for volunteers. Curriculums range from how to reach out to at-risks youth to shoot/don\u2019t shoot scenarios, which are often meant to show members of the public what police officers face when they confront an armed suspect, and which factors lead to the decision to fire their weapons.\u201cThis type of scenario-based role play is not only well received in our community, but has grown in use across the country,\u201d Lt. Katie R. Heck of the Punta Gorda Police Department, said in a statement on Wednesday. The department had operated the scenarios as part of its training program for about two years without incident, Lieutenant Heck said in an email.A CNN report in May showed an anchor, Carol Costello, undergoing a shoot/don\u2019t shoot training session developed by F.B.I. agents. Ms. Costello was outfitted with a heart monitor and given a firearm. She was told to negotiate with a man portraying an emotionally disturbed person who later pulls out a weapon.Ms. Costello hesitates to pull her gun, and another man standing next to her says, \u201cO.K., bam, you\u2019re dead.\u201dIn Punta Gorda, Ms. Knowlton was chosen at random with another person to participate in a session. She was shot during the first of two planned scenarios, the police said.In a statement on Wednesday, Howard Kunik, the city manager, also called the shooting a \u201chorrific accident.\u201d He said that the Police Department\u2019s chaplain had been made available to assist the program\u2019s other attendees.Calls to a phone number listed for the Knowlton family were not immediately returned on Wednesday, but Katie Mazzi, a friend and fellow member of the Friends of the Punta Gorda Library organization, said Ms. Knowlton and her husband, Gary, had moved to Punta Gorda, a harbor town of about 16,000 people near Fort Myers, about 15 years ago.Ms. Mazzi said that the Knowltons were involved in several local philanthropic organizations and their church, and helped mentor at-risk youths.Of the news media attention surrounding the case, Ms. Mazzi, 66, said: \u201cIt\u2019s resonating because of the horrific nature of what happened.

But the closer the police looked, the more complicated the story grew.Supported byLeer en espa\u00f1olSecurity cameras caught most of the brawl on video: the drunken punches thrown on a South Bronx corner known for fistfights and stabbings, a young man in a dark hooded sweatshirt dancing away as four men march after him, a pit bull running down the block alongside them.One of the pursuers was Roberto Rodr\u00edguez, a Mexican immigrant known as Gordo, for his considerable girth. Another was his roommate, L\u00e1zaro Mart\u00ednez.At 11:10 p.m., the figures disappear into the gauzy haze of a floodlight. No security cameras recorded what happened next, but a cellphone captured the aftermath.Mr. Mart\u00ednez lies on the sidewalk, groaning. Dark blood runs from a wound on his right side. Two friends urge him to hold on \u2014 \u201cAguante, amigo.\u201d One fashions a bandage from a T-shirt stripped off his back. An arriving police officer bends to see Mr. Mart\u00ednez\u2019s wound; another radios for an ambulance to be dispatched to the scene, on East 151st Street in the Melrose neighborhood.\u201cPut a rush on the bus,\u201d he says. \u201cOne-five-one.\u201dMr. Rodr\u00edguez, 30, walks calmly into the beam of an arriving officer\u2019s flashlight, one camera shows. His thick silhouette pivots, and he raises his arm toward a green building at 367 East 151st Street into which the young man in the sweatshirt had fled. His hand is pressed hard to his right side, where he, too, has been stabbed. Still, he walks with purpose, treating his injury as an annoyance.Nine years earlier, hoping to earn money to help build a better life for his infant son in Mexico, Mr. Rodr\u00edguez had crossed the Sonoran Desert with a smuggler and entered the United States. In New York City, he found work in kitchens and on construction sites.That was long ago, before his wife in Hidalgo State ran off with his brother-in-law, before he started drinking heavily and using drugs, before he started associating with the Sure\u00f1os 13 gang and moved into a squalid walk-up a block away, living with his pit bull and several workers like him.Now, late on a muggy Saturday night in May, his hand still cupping his wound, Mr. Rodr\u00edguez led the police to the door that he said the young man had entered.\u201cWhere is he?\u201d an officer asked. \u201cRight here,\u201d Mr. Rodr\u00edguez said, motioning at the building.His calm belied a fatal fact: The knife had pierced his liver; deep inside, he was bleeding. He hung his head and leaned on a wrought-iron handrail as another friend tried, in halting English, to describe the attacker.Five minutes later, an ambulance came for Mr. Mart\u00ednez. As it pulled away, Mr. Rodr\u00edguez stepped over to a car and rested his weight on the trunk.Then he fell to his knees, and to the ground. A second ambulance was called. An officer performed chest compressions. The paramedics raced with Mr. Rodr\u00edguez to Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center, where Mr. Mart\u00ednez had already been rushed into surgery.Mr. Mart\u00ednez lived.Mr. Rodr\u00edguez \u2014 2,500 miles from his hometown \u2014 died at 12:05 a.m.The confusion over who was most seriously wounded was a prelude to the fog that would envelop Mr. Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s killing, the seventh homicide logged this year in the 40th Precinct, which has since recorded several more and now has 12 for the year.What looked at first like a brawl between strangers was in fact a fight between men who knew each other well. Fingerprints soon led detectives to a suspect, Alberto Aquino-Simon, 19, who was often seen socializing with Mr. Rodr\u00edguez. A grand jury later would later indict him on charges of murder and attempted murder.When Mr. Aquino-Simon turned himself in 11 days after the stabbings, his lawyer said he had acted in self-defense. Then, a few days later, detectives learned that what seemed like a spontaneous episode of drunken violence might well have been an act of revenge or intimidation.It turned out that Mr. Rodr\u00edguez had told people he had witnessed Mr. Aquino-Simon stab a rival gang member at a Bronx street fair in June 2015. Mr. Rodr\u00edguez let it be known he was willing to testify in court, and he seemed undeterred by the prospect of antagonizing the Cholos 152, a Mexican-American gang whose members he had come to know and who consider 151st Street and Courtlandt Avenue to be their territory.That corner was a long way from the cramped cement house where Mr. Rodr\u00edguez grew up in Tulancingo, Hidalgo. He was the youngest son of a construction worker and part-time musician, living with five siblings under an improvised tin roof held down by ropes and cable cords. His family called him Beto.His mother, Barbara Robles, said Mr. Rodr\u00edguez was a mischievous boy who liked to hike and fish but was bored at school and dropped out after the sixth grade. When he was little, he earned money by picking up bags of groceries for people at the bus station, and at age 11, he would tag along with his father to construction sites.He took jobs in textile factories and married young. When his bride, Maribel Peralta, became pregnant, he decided to move to the United States in search of higher pay, telling his family he hoped to save enough to one day open a gymnasium in Tulancingo and buy a piece of land. \u201cThat was his only dream, to leave something to his son, for his future,\u201d his mother said in an interview at the family home.Just before his son was born, Mr. Rodr\u00edguez made his first attempt to cross the border. Agents with the United States Border Patrol caught him after his trek through the Sonoran Desert, detained him for 10 days and sent him back. He still had spines and burs in his feet when he stumbled into his family\u2019s living room, his mother said.That summer, Ms. Peralta gave birth. Her father, living in New York City, paid a smuggler $3,500 to take Mr. Rodr\u00edguez across the border again. This time, Mr. Rodr\u00edguez made it. He found work in restaurants and on construction sites. His relatives said he called home twice each week to ask about his son, Alan, and to request pictures.Then, a year into his stay, things fell apart: Ms. Peralta had an affair and left him, leaving their son with his parents. The breakup left Mr. Rodr\u00edguez with no emotional anchor in Mexico, and as the years wore on, his family noticed changes. He started calling home drunk, got tattoos and developed a taste for marijuana, his sister Griselda Rodr\u00edguez said.His descent into depression and alcohol abuse mirrors a pattern that researchers have identified among some male illegal immigrants who are severed from their families and unable to go home, said Alyshia G\u00e1lvez, a professor of anthropology and Latin American studies at the City University of New York. \u201cThere is a priest in Puebla who calls it the \u2018broken heart syndrome,\u2019\u201d she said.Three years ago, Mr. Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s calls stopped altogether, his family said.\u201cI think that\u2019s when we lost him,\u201d his sister said in an interview, sitting in the family\u2019s living room in an unfinished house near a highway in Tulancingo. \u201cBefore leaving for the U.S., he didn\u2019t like tattoos, or have any vices. He just changed.\u201dSigns that Mr. Rodr\u00edguez was drifting appeared on his Facebook page: Sure\u00f1os gang symbols on his apartment walls, photos of him posing with a pistol and with a bowie knife.About three years ago, he landed a job as a taco cook at El Bravo on Melrose Avenue, where he told his employers that other gang members drove him from Queens with death threats, an owner said. It was there, during idle moments around El Bravo\u2019s pool table, that he befriended members of the Cholos 152, two former gang members said.Mr. Rodr\u00edguez did not last long as a cook. He was fired after six months for selling drugs out of the kitchen, taking loans he did not repay and getting into fistfights with patrons, the owner said. For the last few months, he had been doing demolition work in Yonkers.The apartment where he lived with several roommates, at 298 East 151st Street, became known for rowdy parties. Mr. Rodr\u00edguez did not pay rent, his landlord said, but charged friends $200 a month to sleep on his floor.Members of the Cholos drank and smoked marijuana in the building\u2019s dingy stairwell, as well as in Mr. Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s apartment, neighbors said.While drinking, Mr. Rodr\u00edguez would express bitterness over his low pay, his status as an illegal immigrant and his station in life. He was quick to start fights or use his pit bull, Duchess, to intimidate people.\u201cHe was a violent person when he drank,\u201d said Wanda Rodr\u00edguez, a neighbor who considered Mr. Rodr\u00edguez a friend. \u201cHe used to bully people.\u201dStill, neighbors said he could be jovial and bighearted when he was sober. He held barbecues in a small concrete yard in front of his building, grilling chicken he had bought wholesale from a friend and providing coolers of cold beer.He also longed for female companionship, friends said. Two years ago, he started an online relationship with a divorced woman in Mexico and began sending her money to help support her two children, the woman, Ana Mart\u00ednez, said. On his days off, he would sit at the same table near the beer cooler in the Huaxcuaxtla Restaurant on Courtlandt Avenue, looking at the altar for the Virgin of Guadalupe and listening to norte\u00f1o music on the jukebox. He always ordered a steak with green chilaquiles and a Modelo beer. \u201cLife for him was his bottle of Modelo,\u201d his regular waitress, Veronica Gutierrez, said with a smile.At first, detectives thought Mr. Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s drinking may have been at the root of the stabbing.Fights arise frequently at 151st Street and Courtlandt Avenue, the police and residents said, usually over petty grievances, drunken insults or romantic triangles. Over five years, there have been at least 11 stabbings and shootings within two blocks. Sometimes, the combatants are immigrant men like Mr. Rodr\u00edguez, who are drawn to the area\u2019s low-priced rooms and are sometimes seen staggering from corner to corner as night falls.But the street is also home to children of the Mexican migrants who began arriving in large numbers in the mid-1990s. In total, there are at least 600,000 Mexican immigrants and their children in New York City and the surrounding counties. The teenagers and young adults, whose parents are mostly from rural towns in Puebla, Guerrero and Oaxaca, are now graduating from high school and college. A few, like Mr. Aquino-Simon, have dropped out of school to join street gangs like the Cholos and the Vatos Locos.The block presents a microcosm of the Mexican diaspora in the South Bronx, with immigrants at different stages of their American experience. The halls of nearby apartment buildings are filled in the afternoons with the smell of spiced meats and the sounds of ranchera accordion music. Men come and go covered with the dust of work sites or dressed in the orange vests and ball caps favored by the army of food deliverymen in Manhattan. Women tow children home after school and work.While those are the stable families, the strivers, Mr. Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s building housed people who had fallen off the rails. Outside Hessen Deli at 151st and Courtlandt, bleary-eyed men loiter throughout the afternoon and night. When they have cash, they buy beer, usually drinking it a block away on 152nd Street, the neighborhood\u2019s skid row.\u201cThere are many Mexicans over there who are now practically homeless,\u201d said Pedro Ortega, a native of Puebla who has lived in the neighborhood for 20 years and owns a nearby grocery and restaurant.The afternoon of May 7 began with Mr. Rodr\u00edguez and his roommates partying early, around 4 p.m., according to Mr. Mart\u00ednez. The seven men were off that day. They watched television, listened to music and roasted a pork loin, he said. Then the beer ran out.Mr. Mart\u00ednez said he went out with Miguel Mart\u00ednez (no relation) and Mr. Rodr\u00edguez at 11 p.m. to buy more beer and sandwiches at the corner bodega. There, he said, they encountered about six Cholos in the street, among them Mr. Aquino-Simon. \u201cThey were already there, and they were looking for trouble,\u201d he said. Mr. Aquino-Simon yelled something in English to Mr. Rodr\u00edguez, and the fight ignited, L\u00e1zaro Mart\u00ednez said.But another immigrant living at the house, Silvano Casta\u00f1eda, told the police that it was he who had been dispatched to buy the beer and got into a fight at the bodega. He said several of his roommates, including Mr. Rodr\u00edguez, had come to his aid.Others said the fight might have been about money. Two witnesses said in interviews that they had heard Mr. Rodr\u00edguez telling his friends just before the brawl that he had been robbed and urging them to find the person who had taken his money. He also told the first police officers who responded that Mr. Aquino-Simon had taken something from him.Security camera videos from a nonprofit on the corner do little to clarify things. They show Mr. Rodr\u00edguez march up to a group of three people and, without breaking stride, punch a woman, knocking her and one of her companions to the ground. Those people were never found by detectives.Then Mr. Aquino-Simon and at least three other reputed Cholos can be seen sprinting up the block from 367 East 151st Street, where neighbors said they used a second-floor apartment as a \u201ctrap house,\u201d to smoke marijuana and host parties. Mr. Aquino-Simon joins the fray.Thirty-five seconds later, Mr. Aquino-Simon is seen on security camera video backing down the sidewalk toward the building that holds the gang\u2019s hangout, with L\u00e1zaro Mart\u00ednez and Miguel Mart\u00ednez following him. He hits L\u00e1zaro Mart\u00ednez twice before retreating again, with an unidentified man at his side. Mr. Rodr\u00edguez and Mr. Casta\u00f1eda arrive, and the four friends move in a group toward Mr. Aquino-Simon.One witness said Mr. Aquino-Simon ran into the building, vowing to his companion that he would kill someone, then returning to the sidewalk a minute later with a knife. A second witness saw Mr. Rodr\u00edguez and L\u00e1zaro Mart\u00ednez struggling to open the door of the building. Neither witness saw the stabbing itself. Both spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared reprisals from the Cholos.L\u00e1zaro Mart\u00ednez said he remembered standing on the sidewalk, fighting with Mr. Aquino-Simon and a second man, who had a cane, when Mr. Aquino-Simon\u2019s knife entered his side with a sickening thump. Then he blacked out, he said. Mr. Casta\u00f1eda, who declined to be interviewed, told detectives that he saw Mr. Aquino-Simon open the door of the building and thrust with a knife toward both Mr. Mart\u00ednez and Mr. Rodr\u00edguez as they stood on the landing. Blood was found inside the vestibule and just outside the door.\u201cEveryone remembers it differently; that\u2019s just the way it goes,\u201d said Rick Simplicio, the lead detective on the case. \u201cBut if they all put the same person in same area, we\u2019re good with that.\u201dMr. Aquino-Simon\u2019s lawyer, Todd A. Spodek, said his client was trapped between two doors in the vestibule, as Mr. Rodr\u00edguez and L\u00e1zaro Mart\u00ednez threatened him from outside, and Mr. Rodr\u00edguez waved a knife. He said Mr. Aquino-Simon opened the outer door to try to talk to Mr. Rodr\u00edguez, but the big man tried to push his way in, Mr. Spodek said. Fearing for his life, Mr. Aquino-Simon used a knife to defend himself, Mr. Spodek said.\u201cIt was a \u2018kill or be killed\u2019 situation,\u201d Mr. Spodek said.Detectives first thought the brawl had been prompted by a trivial insult at the bodega, when one of Mr. Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s friends was buying beer. \u201cAnd it just escalated,\u201d Sgt. Michael J. LoPuzzo, the commander of the 40th Precinct detective squad, said on May 20, a couple of weeks after the killing. \u201cNobody had to die here.\u201dThen came a twist. Detective Simplicio received a tip that Mr. Rodr\u00edguez had been feuding with the Cholos over his plans to testify in court that Mr. Aquino-Simon was responsible for the stabbing of a rival gang member in June 2015 at the Bronx Terminal Market. Mr. Rodr\u00edguez had made his decision to testify known in the neighborhood, giving Mr. Aquino-Simon a motive to silence him, said a defense lawyer for Baraquiel Castelan, the man charged in that case.\u201cHe couldn\u2019t keep a secret,\u201d the lawyer, Telesforo Del Valle Jr., said. \u201cHe was so upset about it.\u201dIn an interview at the Rikers Island jail complex, Mr. Castelan asserted his innocence, just as he said his friend Mr. Rodr\u00edguez would have. \u201cHonestly, I didn\u2019t do it,\u201d he said.Mr. Castelan denied being a gang leader, saying the Cholos were \u201cmore like friends than a gang.\u201d But the police said he took over as the leader of the Cholos in late 2013 after Miguel Castelan \u2014 a distant relative \u2014 was paralyzed in a shooting related to a long-running feud between the Cholos and the Vatos Locos.The twist had a complicated back story. Anthony Velazquez, now 25, a reputed Vatos Locos member, was attacked by at least eight men at the fair in the Bronx Terminal Market, according to a criminal complaint. Mr. Velazquez has a child with Baraquiel Castelan\u2019s sister. He told the police that Mr. Castelan had stabbed him after an argument over custody of the baby.Mr. Castelan said that he did not join in the attack and that Mr. Rodr\u00edguez would have exonerated him. Mr. Rodr\u00edguez had seen the fight because he had borrowed Mr. Castelan\u2019s car that day and brought several Cholos to the fair, including Mr. Aquino-Simon, he said. \u201cWe were all friends,\u201d Mr. Castelan said. \u201cWe know each other very well.\u201dMr. Rodr\u00edguez showed up at the courthouse along with other defense witnesses the day the grand jury met, several of Mr. Castelan\u2019s relatives said. He was discouraged from testifying after being informed he might open himself up to prosecution, but he intended to appear at Mr. Castelan\u2019s trial this fall, Mr. Del Valle said.The Bronx district attorney\u2019s office said it had no record that Mr. Rodr\u00edguez offered his testimony to the grand jury. Patrice O\u2019Shaughnessy, a spokeswoman for the office, said prosecutors had the testimony of the victim and a second witness, both of whom knew Mr. Castelan well enough to identify him as the assailant.Mr. Spodek said his client had nothing to do with the stabbing of Mr. Velazquez.Detective Simplicio and Sergeant LoPuzzo said time might reveal the motive for Mr. Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s murder. But for now, they have witnesses who say Mr. Aquino-Simon stabbed Mr. Rodr\u00edguez, and that is enough. \u201cI\u2019m satisfied with that,\u201d Sergeant LoPuzzo said.Mr. Castelan said he had once been close to Mr. Aquino-Simon, a son of Mexican immigrants who was raised by a single mother in the Wagner Houses in East Harlem. Mr. Aquino-Simon had shown up in Cholos territory around 2013 and befriended several members of the gang, hanging around at El Bravo, where Mr. Rodriguez worked, Mr. Castelan said.Though Mr. Aquino-Simon had good grades and ran track, he dropped out of high school his sophomore year, when his girlfriend became pregnant, his sister Miriam Aquino said. Intent on supporting his child, he delivered food for an Italian restaurant on East 86th Street. Later, he got a job working for a wholesale grocer in Hunts Point.Eric Chevere, a club manager and a lifelong resident of 151st Street, said Mr. Aquino-Simon had confided to him that he joined the Cholos for fear of other gangs. \u201cHe did it because he needed protection,\u201d Mr. Chevere said.But he also adopted the name Diablito, meaning \u201clittle devil.\u201d He started tagging lampposts and buildings along 151st Street with the letters CLS, for Cholos, people who knew him said. He was arrested three times over two years on felony charges, including robbery and assault, but the records of those proceedings are sealed because of his age, the police said.\u201cIf he sees you getting beat up,\u201d one former gang member said of Mr. Aquino-Simon, he is \u201cgoing to help you. That\u2019s the kind of friend he was.\u201dSince Mr. Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s death, the men who live in his apartment have avoided the street, shuttering themselves inside and declining interviews. Several said they were afraid of reprisals from the Cholos for speaking to the police. \u201cThis place is dangerous \u2014 it\u2019s hell out here,\u201d Miguel Mart\u00ednez said as he declined a request for an interview.The men who took part in the fight have moved away, and the remainder are facing eviction, the landlord said. Detective Simplicio acknowledged that it would be hard to track them down when the case comes to trial.In Mexico, Mr. Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s family buried him in a churchyard near his house, after raising money to transport his remains. His body was too wide for the standard coffin provided by the Mexican government.His sister Griselda wept in the family kitchen as she spoke about the sweet, rambunctious Mr. Rodr\u00edguez she knew. Nearby was a shrine she had built to her brother: four candles, a photograph of him wearing the Mexican flag as a bandanna, and two bunches of red and white roses. A doughnut and a cup of coffee sat next to the photo. \u201cBecause he liked them so much,\u201d she said.She recalled her brother\u2019s last phone call home in 2013, when he spoke to the son he hardly knew.\u201cAlan asked him, \u2018Daddy, when are you coming back?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBeto responded: \u2018Any day now. Any day.\u2019\u201dReporting was contributed by Sandra E. Garcia, Benjamin Mueller, Ashley Southall and Isvett Verde from New York, and Paulina Villegas from Tulancingo, Mexico. Susan C.

After all, one\u2019s friends tend to share one\u2019s political biases. Facebook likes sharing because it builds loyalty to Facebook.Sharing, to Facebook, is a way that you build your personal brand, a statement of ego that is likely to keep you on the site longer. That is why Facebook\u2019s computers watch what you do on the site. It wants to know what kind of stories to put in front of you, so you will read and share them.On one hand, this is a nice service: You get the kind of news you seem to enjoy reading, which speaks to your worldview. On the other hand, this impedes encountering views unlike yours.Approaching difference with empathy is at the heart of democracy, so the more our own views are endorsed by algorithms, the worse off democracy is. Look no further than the incomprehension and contempt with which many on both sides view each other in the current election season.Of course, this existed long before Facebook. Talk radio and cable news enabled a range of viewpoints, and the biggest networks run programs that endorse a worldview of the right or the left.

But if students know that a college is looking for essays that reflect their ability to empathize with others, they will comply with the mandate, whether or not they are altruistic.If admissions personnel are looking only for students who can append a list of public service activities to their applications, they will exclude those who, for various reasons, cannot work part time or travel to Guatemala to paint houses. Some of the excluded may be too busy studying, hoping that their grades and letters of recommendation will speak for themselves.If college applicants are lacking in public service, it does not mean that they have no sense of empathy (which is becoming one of the most abused words in public discourse).Dispense with the essay, and use personal interviews, if necessary, for borderline cases. But stop expecting students to model themselves after Mother Teresa.BERNARD F. DICKTeaneck, N.J.The writer is professor emeritus of communication and English at Fairleigh Dickinson University.To the Editor:In high school, I did community service to get into a good college. I went to Mexico as a dental assistant and struggled with the hypocrisy that Frank Bruni describes \u2014 performing a selfless deed for a selfish reason. I now realize that if it weren\u2019t for the external pressure, I probably wouldn\u2019t have gone at all.It is heartening, though, that colleges still give applicants credit for community service. There are many factors they could consider instead, like standardized tests (favoring those with resources) or donations (which they value most from alumni).Encouraging high school students to volunteer is, I think, like asking them to read great works of literature. They may not \u201cget it\u201d the first time around, but without the exposure, they won\u2019t be able to ponder the experience years later.JUSTIN JEENew YorkTo the Editor:For good or bad, younger Americans seem to be a part of the most goal-oriented generation ever.I moved to the United States six years ago and was immediately struck by how a casual get-together would immediately be labeled \u201cgreat for networking.\u201d How people simply collected \u201cfriends\u201d as long as they were useful. How people volunteered not to help others but to present themselves as givers.And how people would take part once in a Tough Mudder endurance event so they would be able to show off their tough adventurer facet forever after.

Random House. $28.As a dissection of the American dream, Imbolo Mbue\u2019s first novel is savage and compassionate in all the right places. Two families in New York are hit by the 2008 financial crisis in radically different ways. Jende Jonga is a Cameroonian immigrant living in Harlem with his wife, Neni, and their son, Liomi. He panics at the possibility of losing his job, being deported and failing as a husband and father. He works as a chauffeur for Clark Edwards, an executive at Lehman Brothers. Clark lives with his wife, Cindy, on the Upper East Side, with its \u201cstreets with no dirt\u201d and \u201cdoormen dressed like rich men.\u201d They vacation in places like St. Barths and Aspen, Colo., and own the requisite Hamptons estate, but in private \u2014 as Jende and Neni painfully learn \u2014 the Edwardses are more tragic than enviable. \u201cIn the driver\u2019s seat, Jende pretended not to hear anything,\u201d Ms. Mbue writes of Clark\u2019s constant cellphone conversations. Just as you think the author has served up a rather predictable set of characters (callous rich guy, pill-popping wife, virtuous immigrants), she slyly complicates them. In one scene, after Neni learns that her family\u2019s existence in America has been threatened, her ruthless gambit to protect them is awe-inspiring.By Krys Lee246 pages. Viking. $26.As the son of a well-known actress and a government official, Yongju, a 21-year-old from Pyongyang, North Korea, enjoys a life of wealth and privilege, until his father is assassinated at a lavish reception. Jangmi, a pregnant North Korean teenager, hopes for a less dire future after selling herself to a Chinese man and becoming his wife, but the plan goes horribly wrong. A bullied gay 16-year-old, Danny \u2014 Chinese-born but with relatives in both China and North Korea \u2014 lives with his father in Fresno, Calif. His mother has left the family for missionary work, and a new lover, in China. The stories of these three young people converge following acts of persecution and betrayal. Fugitives from their own lives, they end up banding together in a heavily patrolled Chinese border town. Shifting among the desperate voices of Yongju, Danny and Jangmi, Ms. Lee, who lives in Seoul, South Korea, eloquently draws attention to issues of displacement, loss and identity, and to China\u2019s record of human rights abuses against North Korean refugees.By Gonzalo Torn\u00e9, translated from the Spanish by Megan McDowell302 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $26.95.In this digressive, scathingly funny novel, a middle-aged Spanish man, Joan-Marc Mir\u00f3-Puig, records the story of his catastrophic first marriage to Helen, an alcoholic from Montana. His second wife has left him, too, but Joan-Marc, addressing her, unleashes his soliloquy anyway. Although he has not seen Helen in nearly 20 years, his loathing for her has not subsided (nor has his fixation on her breasts). His misery knows no bounds: He despises obese people, immigrants, gays and even the old friends who seek him out on Facebook. In rare moments when Joan-Marc is \u201cdrenched in an excellent mood,\u201d he finds something to praise \u2014 like \u201cthe fabulous power of saturated fats\u201d in a bag of chips. More often, he feels sorry for himself. He ruminates on his regrets, anxieties, health problems, aversion to masturbation (tedious) and to working (he\u2019s never done it). He details his father\u2019s suicide. And he revisits countless nasty arguments with Helen, which usually ended in bouts of athletic sex. Because Mr. Torn\u00e9 never presents Joan-Marc as anything but pitiful \u2014 and startlingly idiotic in his misogyny \u2014 he proves endearing. And he gets the fate he deserves.By Lisa McInerney389 pages. Tim Duggan Books. $27.Drugs, booze, obscenity, violence and black humor fuel Lisa McInerney\u2019s audacious first novel, winner of the 2016 Baileys Women\u2019s Prize for Fiction. In the Irish city of Cork, Maureen Phelan discovers an intruder in her home (a former brothel), and she hits him over the head with her beloved \u201cHoly Stone\u201d: a flat rock painted gold, depicting the Virgin Mary holding \u201cChubby Toddler Jesus.\u201d She realizes too late what she\u2019s done: \u201cHe was definitely dead, whoever he was.\u201d This scene sets off an extraordinary set of events involving Maureen\u2019s gangster son, Jimmy Phelan; a 15-year-old drug dealer, Ryan Cusack; his petty criminal father, Tony, known as \u201cthe wreck\u201d and prone to \u201chot, cheap rage\u201d; and a prostitute, Georgie, who seeks redemption through a Christian commune, only to find herself snorting cocaine off a Bible. Hoping for salvation, these wayward souls attempt atonement in their own bizarre ways. Ms. McInerney offers empathy even to her most depraved characters. This novel is impressive for its moral complexity, and for the energy and virtuosity of its language: a strange, pleasing music that lingers in your mind.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018I Have a Black Son in Baltimore\u2019: Anxious New Parents and an Era of Unease", "Date": "2016-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBALTIMORE \u2014 He assembled the crib and mounted the bookshelves. She unpacked the bedding and filled the closet with onesies and rompers. Then husband and wife stood in the nursery and worried. Bill Janu, a police officer, is white. Shanna Janu, a lawyer, is black. As they eagerly awaited their baby\u2019s birth this spring, they felt increasingly anxious.They had chosen not to find out their baby\u2019s gender ahead of time. But their nearly two years of marriage had been punctuated by the killings of African-American men and boys in Ferguson, Mo.; Brooklyn; Cleveland; North Charleston, S.C.; and Baltimore, all at the hands of the police. Mr. Janu, who longed for a son, tried to reassure his wife. Mrs. Janu emailed him one article after another, warning of the perils that face black boys.As the due date approached, Mr. Janu found himself praying for a girl.In the delivery room at St. Agnes Hospital, after more than 20 hours of labor, the infant finally arrived, red-faced and wailing. The newborn had Mr. Janu\u2019s blue eyes and Mrs. Janu\u2019s full lips and nose. The new father exulted. Then he felt the weight of his new reality.\u201cNow, I have a black son in Baltimore,\u201d the white police detective remembered thinking as he cradled his baby boy.The violence has been wrenching for families like the Janus, an interracial couple struggling to straddle the nation\u2019s racial fault lines in a red brick rowhouse in a quiet corner of Baltimore. But the heated national discussions over policing and race feel particularly piercing for a black woman born in the South and her white husband who wears a badge.Born in Louisiana, Mrs. Janu grew up in a predominantly white suburb in upstate New York, joined a white sorority in college and married a white detective. Yet these days, she fears that racism and bias might be \u201chard-wired\u201d into society and wonders how that might affect her family.She worries as her husband holsters his Glock 22, kisses her goodbye and heads out the door to pursue gun runners and violent criminals in this predominantly black city. Will he be a target now on the street?She worries as she has adjusted to the rhythms of round-the-clock feedings and diaper changes. What dangers might Wesley face as a teenager at the hands of the police?And then there is the racial divide that runs right through her living room, the issues that occasionally create a rift between husband and wife. Mrs. Janu, 31, is a strong supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement, for instance, while Mr. Janu, 42, argues that some of its activists \u201cdo more harm than good\u201d and spew \u201ca lot of hate\u201d toward the police.\u201cAm I being a disloyal law enforcement wife because I do feel so strongly for Black Lives Matter, because I do feel such a strong affinity for the movement?\u201d asked Mrs. Janu, describing her internal turmoil during 12 weeks of maternity leave.\u201cI try to see both sides of it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt leaves me a little bit torn.\u201dThe warnings flashed on Mr. Janu\u2019s cellphone after nightfall on July 7 as he cruised through downtown Baltimore in his unmarked police car. It was his first inkling that a calamity was unfolding.\u201cWatch your back,\u201d one friend texted.\u201cBe safe out there,\u201d another wrote.At home, Mrs. Janu was trying to erase the image of a dying black man from her mind. She had delighted that day in one of Wesley\u2019s milestones, when she realized he was following her every move with his eyes, and recorded the thrill in an app tracking his development.Mrs. Janu scrambled to press the pause button, but she had already seen too much. She sat stunned on the sofa, with Wesley in her arms, reliving her fears about his future.\u201cAll I wanted to do was hug her,\u201d he said.The couple met six years ago, casually introduced by mutual friends who were shocked when they got together. Mrs. Janu, who is wry and bracingly frank, had vowed never to date a police officer. She had grown up hearing her parents\u2019 stories about ugly encounters between African-Americans and the police in the segregated South.She remembers the day her father was pulled over. She was 7 at the time, sitting in the back seat. And she still remembers the pains he took afterward \u2014 checking and rechecking his turn lights and headlights \u2014 to ensure that it would never happen again. \u201cBullies,\u201d she said, matter-of-factly describing the men she assumed joined the force.Mr. Janu, who is stocky, bald and bearded, looked like a character in a television crime drama. He had spent a decade in the military and a decade on the police force, mostly in a specialized squad that focused on gun sales and gun offenders.But he was unlike any officer she had encountered. He was silly and cracked her up. He had studied marine biology in college, loved travel and art and shared her nostalgia for \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer,\u201d the cult television series. (The Janus named their son and one of their dogs, Buffy, a Maltese poodle mix, after characters in the show.)His father, who abhors interracial relationships, stopped speaking to him. Mr. Janu was undeterred by his disapproval, and by the stream of news articles and blog posts that Mrs. Janu emailed him, warning about the challenges facing interracial couples and parents of biracial children.But the pain still surfaces. A year ago, Mr. Janu bumped into his father while he was visiting family near Cleveland. His father stood up without speaking, strode to his white convertible and locked the door. Mr. Janu chased after him, pounding his fists on the car windows.\u201cWhy won\u2019t you talk to me?\u201d he remembered shouting before his father drove off.Sometimes, the Janus manage to put that aside, the knowledge that their son might never meet his paternal grandfather, and their fears about what he might face as a young man.They lose themselves in the cocoon of their two-story home, shouting out answers to the contestants on \u201cFamily Feud,\u201d chatting about the summer electric bill, the paperwork for day care and their perennial efforts to prod Wesley to nap just a little bit longer, which most recently involved the purchase of an outfit called \u201cBaby Merlin\u2019s Magic Sleepsuit.\u201dThey focus on Wesley \u2014 Mr. Janu calls him \u201cLittle Man\u201d \u2014 on the grip of his fingers, the pout of his lower lip, the way he scales tall buildings with his eyes. \u201cI think he wants to climb them,\u201d joked his father, who envisions his boy hurling a football and sliding into home plate.But this summer, the ugliness of the outside world has always seemed to intrude.Just days after the Dallas shootings, one of Mr. Janu\u2019s colleagues, an officer who had attended his wedding, narrowly escaped a spray of gunfire. Some in the department worried initially that the assailant had intended to ambush the police.\u201cThere\u2019s going to be rioting \u2014 is that what you\u2019re saying?\u201d asked Mrs. Janu, her phone tight to her ear, as she bounced Wesley on her hip.Mrs. Janu considers herself the no-nonsense, practical parent, but the list fills her with sadness. \u201cBlack boys aren\u2019t allowed to be innocent or young,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have that privilege.\u201dMr. Janu felt bewildered at first by such talk. He is the optimist in the family, the dreamer. He had never imagined such a discussion with his son. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have to explain that to a white child,\u201d he said.He said he had lived most of his life \u201cwith blinders on.\u201d His conversations with his wife have opened his eyes.In the past, Mr. Janu said, he often assumed that the black boys he saw on impoverished street corners were criminals-to-be, youngsters destined for handcuffs. Now, he looks for the exuberance in the faces of the wisecracking, jostling boys still savoring the waning days of summer.He hopes that other police officers will see that, too, someday, in his son.Follow Rachel Swarns @rachelswarns on Twitter.Advertisement"}

The app takes an image, breaks it down and turns it into something new. The end result looks like something created by an artist with a paintbrush on canvas instead of a photo.With the help of artificial intelligence, the app repaints an original picture from scratch. \u201cWe don\u2019t use filters, which are applied on top of the picture,\u201d said Alexey Moiseenkov, chief executive of Prisma Labs, the app\u2019s maker.The trick is that Prisma\u2019s so-called neural networks have been trained to emulate many different art styles, and can transform your landscape photos, selfies or even snapshots of your cat into something much more interesting.\u201cIt went viral in a flash,\u201d Mr. Moiseenkov said.The app is simple to use and impressive \u2014 the effects are often eye-popping, and you will find yourself using many filters on an image before settling on the one you like best.To use Prisma, you either snap a photo using the built-in camera controls or choose an image from your archive. Then you dial through the available special effects, which include blobby impressionism, Picassoesque abstraction, mangalike cartoons and even classic Japanese pen and ink paintings, and select one with a tap.Prisma\u2019s A.I. algorithms are based on open-source code that the company\u2019s team has improved upon so that it works much faster. The app sends your photo to the company\u2019s servers, where your image is reworked in a few seconds and then sent back to the app, where you can see the results.Photos are temporarily stored before being deleted the next day, Mr. Moiseenkov said.You can publish your image to Instagram or Facebook directly from Prisma, or download it to share via messaging or email. Images include a Prisma-branded watermark, but users can choose to remove this in the settings.The Prisma app is free \u2014 so how will the company make money? Mr. Moiseenkov said it would let large brands sponsor a few effects each month, which will be its main path to revenue. Prisma is free of advertisements.Though the app is already popular, there are several improvements on the way, including the ability to apply the same effects to video clips.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Day Peruvian Women Rebelled", "Date": "2016-08-23", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorAs in other days, the day I rebelled I was walking home from school by myself. I was 13, and I liked to wear the skirt of that godawful Peruvian school uniform above my knees. I loved my legs, and I had recently waxed them for the first time. It was Lima in the 1990s, I was crossing a street avoiding illegally parked cars shining under weak rays of sunshine and I did not even see it coming. All I felt was a burst of discomfort, a whiplash of shame. A hand slightly raising the skirt, brushing my thigh, trying to reach me. It lasted a few seconds. Like every time I experienced a \u201cmetida de mano\u201d \u2014 a local institution of sexual harassment \u2014 I froze and muted an agonized scream.I should have kept walking, dragging my helplessness like any other woman groped in the middle of the street, but I decided to react. He was an older man, bald, who was quietly walking away without looking at me after his \u201cimpish\u201d deed. I did not think long: I ran after him and raised my school backpack with both arms, and with all my strength I slammed it on his head. I flew out of there howling to the heavens my humble revenge.A Peruvian girl is a full-time Little Red Riding Hood. Quite early she learns she has to take this, and not that other, road; that she must watch her back, and feign that she did not hear what they shouted about her vagina.Any man alone at the end of a street is a potential Big Bad Wolf. A taxi: your last trip. Drinking at a party: gambling with your life. To desire: to be a whore. When I wrote a book about sex I got a flood of comments from men threatening to rape me so I would learn. My amazing boss came to the office once with a black eye. My ex-boyfriend broke my nose because he saw me and a girlfriend of mine kissing. I needed nose surgery.A Peruvian woman seldom has the opportunity to react, because self-defense for a woman means rape and murder. The law treats her as the rapist did: Even her miniskirt may justify the crime in court. It is like being raped twice.The day arrives when Red Riding Hood rebels, without turning back. This is what has happened in Peru these past few weeks. Women have taken that backpack in which we carried years of macho violence and smacked society on the head with it.The day we rebelled was a normal day, with its number of women victimized. We were particularly stricken by Lady Gill\u00e9n\u2019s case, disfigured by her boyfriend. But the trigger was Arlette Contreras\u2019s video, in which her naked, drunk boyfriend drags her by her hair through an inn\u2019s corridors.You could finally see what we all, men and women, knew was going on behind closed doors.The outrage was channeled through a Facebook group, #NiUnaMenos. Its goal was to facilitate a large mass demonstration in the streets of Lima, and replicate the impact of protests in Buenos Aires and Mexico City. Something astonishing happened: thousands of women shared their testimonies of violence. They uploaded pictures of their bruises, their scars, their bloodshot and teary eyes. They named their victimizers. It is historic, it is painful, but it also fills you with hope to see how thousands of Peruvian women lost their fear and decided to unite.It is worth remembering that 300,000 women were forcibly sterilized during the dictatorship of Alberto Fujimori. A case that was just shelved.The key to reversing this situation is a new penal code, and to improve the response level of the judiciary system. Hence the need to educate public servants with a focus on gender, to increase the budget for protection, the creation of an Observatory on Violence Against Women and outreach centers for emergencies. A Commission for Gender Justice in the Supreme Court was announced to guarantee nondiscriminatory treatment. A national campaign to uproot the causes of gender violence is a pressing demand.Inspired by #NiUnaMenos, the government of the previous president, Ollanta Humala, in spite of having done so very little for women\u2019s rights, approved a National Plan Against Gender Violence. The government of the current president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski\u2019, has the responsibility to implement it.We went from the social networks to the streets, and from anger we organized.On Aug. 13, Lima\u2019s downtown streets overflowed with women. Many of the abuse survivors, some in wheelchairs because of their partners\u2019 beatings, headed the march and read their testimonies in front of the palace that many in Peru don\u2019t call \u201cof Justice\u201d but \u201cof injustice.\u201d There were also huge demonstrations in Cusco, Trujillo and Iquitos; and in 30 capital cities throughout the world. We now have an app that allows women to report harassment and assaults using their cellphones.Has #NiUnaMenos changed something? Yes, all of it. The process it started is unprecedented and will have social repercussions we can barely guess, but from the moment women in Peru named the mistreatment we suffered in our community, as in a spell, we cast evil a bit away, so there would be not one fewer of us. The day we rebelled is not over, it has just begun.Gabriela Wiener is a Peruvian reporter and writer based in Madrid.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Quest for a New Life Ends in a Tangle of Gang Ties", "Date": "2016-08-24", "News": "Murder in the 4-0The murder of Roberto Rodr\u00edguez in the Bronx appeared to be a drunken street brawl. But the closer the police looked, the more complicated the story grew.Supported byLeer en espa\u00f1olSecurity cameras caught most of the brawl on video: the drunken punches thrown on a South Bronx corner known for fistfights and stabbings, a young man in a dark hooded sweatshirt dancing away as four men march after him, a pit bull running down the block alongside them.One of the pursuers was Roberto Rodr\u00edguez, a Mexican immigrant known as Gordo, for his considerable girth. Another was his roommate, L\u00e1zaro Mart\u00ednez.At 11:10 p.m., the figures disappear into the gauzy haze of a floodlight. No security cameras recorded what happened next, but a cellphone captured the aftermath.Mr. Mart\u00ednez lies on the sidewalk, groaning. Dark blood runs from a wound on his right side. Two friends urge him to hold on \u2014 \u201cAguante, amigo.\u201d One fashions a bandage from a T-shirt stripped off his back. An arriving police officer bends to see Mr. Mart\u00ednez\u2019s wound; another radios for an ambulance to be dispatched to the scene, on East 151st Street in the Melrose neighborhood.\u201cPut a rush on the bus,\u201d he says. \u201cOne-five-one.\u201dMr. Rodr\u00edguez, 30, walks calmly into the beam of an arriving officer\u2019s flashlight, one camera shows. His thick silhouette pivots, and he raises his arm toward a green building at 367 East 151st Street into which the young man in the sweatshirt had fled. His hand is pressed hard to his right side, where he, too, has been stabbed. Still, he walks with purpose, treating his injury as an annoyance.Nine years earlier, hoping to earn money to help build a better life for his infant son in Mexico, Mr. Rodr\u00edguez had crossed the Sonoran Desert with a smuggler and entered the United States. In New York City, he found work in kitchens and on construction sites.That was long ago, before his wife in Hidalgo State ran off with his brother-in-law, before he started drinking heavily and using drugs, before he started associating with the Sure\u00f1os 13 gang and moved into a squalid walk-up a block away, living with his pit bull and several workers like him.Now, late on a muggy Saturday night in May, his hand still cupping his wound, Mr. Rodr\u00edguez led the police to the door that he said the young man had entered.\u201cWhere is he?\u201d an officer asked. \u201cRight here,\u201d Mr. Rodr\u00edguez said, motioning at the building.His calm belied a fatal fact: The knife had pierced his liver; deep inside, he was bleeding. He hung his head and leaned on a wrought-iron handrail as another friend tried, in halting English, to describe the attacker.Five minutes later, an ambulance came for Mr. Mart\u00ednez. As it pulled away, Mr. Rodr\u00edguez stepped over to a car and rested his weight on the trunk.Then he fell to his knees, and to the ground. A second ambulance was called. An officer performed chest compressions. The paramedics raced with Mr. Rodr\u00edguez to Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center, where Mr. Mart\u00ednez had already been rushed into surgery.Mr. Mart\u00ednez lived.Mr. Rodr\u00edguez \u2014 2,500 miles from his hometown \u2014 died at 12:05 a.m.The confusion over who was most seriously wounded was a prelude to the fog that would envelop Mr. Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s killing, the seventh homicide logged this year in the 40th Precinct, which has since recorded several more and now has 12 for the year.What looked at first like a brawl between strangers was in fact a fight between men who knew each other well. Fingerprints soon led detectives to a suspect, Alberto Aquino-Simon, 19, who was often seen socializing with Mr. Rodr\u00edguez. A grand jury later would later indict him on charges of murder and attempted murder.When Mr. Aquino-Simon turned himself in 11 days after the stabbings, his lawyer said he had acted in self-defense. Then, a few days later, detectives learned that what seemed like a spontaneous episode of drunken violence might well have been an act of revenge or intimidation.It turned out that Mr. Rodr\u00edguez had told people he had witnessed Mr. Aquino-Simon stab a rival gang member at a Bronx street fair in June 2015. Mr. Rodr\u00edguez let it be known he was willing to testify in court, and he seemed undeterred by the prospect of antagonizing the Cholos 152, a Mexican-American gang whose members he had come to know and who consider 151st Street and Courtlandt Avenue to be their territory.That corner was a long way from the cramped cement house where Mr. Rodr\u00edguez grew up in Tulancingo, Hidalgo. He was the youngest son of a construction worker and part-time musician, living with five siblings under an improvised tin roof held down by ropes and cable cords. His family called him Beto.His mother, Barbara Robles, said Mr. Rodr\u00edguez was a mischievous boy who liked to hike and fish but was bored at school and dropped out after the sixth grade. When he was little, he earned money by picking up bags of groceries for people at the bus station, and at age 11, he would tag along with his father to construction sites.He took jobs in textile factories and married young. When his bride, Maribel Peralta, became pregnant, he decided to move to the United States in search of higher pay, telling his family he hoped to save enough to one day open a gymnasium in Tulancingo and buy a piece of land. \u201cThat was his only dream, to leave something to his son, for his future,\u201d his mother said in an interview at the family home.Just before his son was born, Mr. Rodr\u00edguez made his first attempt to cross the border. Agents with the United States Border Patrol caught him after his trek through the Sonoran Desert, detained him for 10 days and sent him back. He still had spines and burs in his feet when he stumbled into his family\u2019s living room, his mother said.That summer, Ms. Peralta gave birth. Her father, living in New York City, paid a smuggler $3,500 to take Mr. Rodr\u00edguez across the border again. This time, Mr. Rodr\u00edguez made it. He found work in restaurants and on construction sites. His relatives said he called home twice each week to ask about his son, Alan, and to request pictures.Then, a year into his stay, things fell apart: Ms. Peralta had an affair and left him, leaving their son with his parents. The breakup left Mr. Rodr\u00edguez with no emotional anchor in Mexico, and as the years wore on, his family noticed changes. He started calling home drunk, got tattoos and developed a taste for marijuana, his sister Griselda Rodr\u00edguez said.His descent into depression and alcohol abuse mirrors a pattern that researchers have identified among some male illegal immigrants who are severed from their families and unable to go home, said Alyshia G\u00e1lvez, a professor of anthropology and Latin American studies at the City University of New York. \u201cThere is a priest in Puebla who calls it the \u2018broken heart syndrome,\u2019\u201d she said.Three years ago, Mr. Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s calls stopped altogether, his family said.\u201cI think that\u2019s when we lost him,\u201d his sister said in an interview, sitting in the family\u2019s living room in an unfinished house near a highway in Tulancingo. \u201cBefore leaving for the U.S., he didn\u2019t like tattoos, or have any vices. He just changed.\u201dSigns that Mr. Rodr\u00edguez was drifting appeared on his Facebook page: Sure\u00f1os gang symbols on his apartment walls, photos of him posing with a pistol and with a bowie knife.About three years ago, he landed a job as a taco cook at El Bravo on Melrose Avenue, where he told his employers that other gang members drove him from Queens with death threats, an owner said. It was there, during idle moments around El Bravo\u2019s pool table, that he befriended members of the Cholos 152, two former gang members said.Mr. Rodr\u00edguez did not last long as a cook. He was fired after six months for selling drugs out of the kitchen, taking loans he did not repay and getting into fistfights with patrons, the owner said. For the last few months, he had been doing demolition work in Yonkers.The apartment where he lived with several roommates, at 298 East 151st Street, became known for rowdy parties. Mr. Rodr\u00edguez did not pay rent, his landlord said, but charged friends $200 a month to sleep on his floor.Members of the Cholos drank and smoked marijuana in the building\u2019s dingy stairwell, as well as in Mr. Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s apartment, neighbors said.While drinking, Mr. Rodr\u00edguez would express bitterness over his low pay, his status as an illegal immigrant and his station in life. He was quick to start fights or use his pit bull, Duchess, to intimidate people.\u201cHe was a violent person when he drank,\u201d said Wanda Rodr\u00edguez, a neighbor who considered Mr. Rodr\u00edguez a friend. \u201cHe used to bully people.\u201dStill, neighbors said he could be jovial and bighearted when he was sober. He held barbecues in a small concrete yard in front of his building, grilling chicken he had bought wholesale from a friend and providing coolers of cold beer.He also longed for female companionship, friends said. Two years ago, he started an online relationship with a divorced woman in Mexico and began sending her money to help support her two children, the woman, Ana Mart\u00ednez, said. On his days off, he would sit at the same table near the beer cooler in the Huaxcuaxtla Restaurant on Courtlandt Avenue, looking at the altar for the Virgin of Guadalupe and listening to norte\u00f1o music on the jukebox. He always ordered a steak with green chilaquiles and a Modelo beer. \u201cLife for him was his bottle of Modelo,\u201d his regular waitress, Veronica Gutierrez, said with a smile.At first, detectives thought Mr. Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s drinking may have been at the root of the stabbing.Fights arise frequently at 151st Street and Courtlandt Avenue, the police and residents said, usually over petty grievances, drunken insults or romantic triangles. Over five years, there have been at least 11 stabbings and shootings within two blocks. Sometimes, the combatants are immigrant men like Mr. Rodr\u00edguez, who are drawn to the area\u2019s low-priced rooms and are sometimes seen staggering from corner to corner as night falls.But the street is also home to children of the Mexican migrants who began arriving in large numbers in the mid-1990s. In total, there are at least 600,000 Mexican immigrants and their children in New York City and the surrounding counties. The teenagers and young adults, whose parents are mostly from rural towns in Puebla, Guerrero and Oaxaca, are now graduating from high school and college. A few, like Mr. Aquino-Simon, have dropped out of school to join street gangs like the Cholos and the Vatos Locos.The block presents a microcosm of the Mexican diaspora in the South Bronx, with immigrants at different stages of their American experience. The halls of nearby apartment buildings are filled in the afternoons with the smell of spiced meats and the sounds of ranchera accordion music. Men come and go covered with the dust of work sites or dressed in the orange vests and ball caps favored by the army of food deliverymen in Manhattan. Women tow children home after school and work.While those are the stable families, the strivers, Mr. Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s building housed people who had fallen off the rails. Outside Hessen Deli at 151st and Courtlandt, bleary-eyed men loiter throughout the afternoon and night. When they have cash, they buy beer, usually drinking it a block away on 152nd Street, the neighborhood\u2019s skid row.\u201cThere are many Mexicans over there who are now practically homeless,\u201d said Pedro Ortega, a native of Puebla who has lived in the neighborhood for 20 years and owns a nearby grocery and restaurant.The afternoon of May 7 began with Mr. Rodr\u00edguez and his roommates partying early, around 4 p.m., according to Mr. Mart\u00ednez. The seven men were off that day. They watched television, listened to music and roasted a pork loin, he said. Then the beer ran out.Mr. Mart\u00ednez said he went out with Miguel Mart\u00ednez (no relation) and Mr. Rodr\u00edguez at 11 p.m. to buy more beer and sandwiches at the corner bodega. There, he said, they encountered about six Cholos in the street, among them Mr. Aquino-Simon. \u201cThey were already there, and they were looking for trouble,\u201d he said. Mr. Aquino-Simon yelled something in English to Mr. Rodr\u00edguez, and the fight ignited, L\u00e1zaro Mart\u00ednez said.But another immigrant living at the house, Silvano Casta\u00f1eda, told the police that it was he who had been dispatched to buy the beer and got into a fight at the bodega. He said several of his roommates, including Mr. Rodr\u00edguez, had come to his aid.Others said the fight might have been about money. Two witnesses said in interviews that they had heard Mr. Rodr\u00edguez telling his friends just before the brawl that he had been robbed and urging them to find the person who had taken his money. He also told the first police officers who responded that Mr. Aquino-Simon had taken something from him.Security camera videos from a nonprofit on the corner do little to clarify things. They show Mr. Rodr\u00edguez march up to a group of three people and, without breaking stride, punch a woman, knocking her and one of her companions to the ground. Those people were never found by detectives.Then Mr. Aquino-Simon and at least three other reputed Cholos can be seen sprinting up the block from 367 East 151st Street, where neighbors said they used a second-floor apartment as a \u201ctrap house,\u201d to smoke marijuana and host parties. Mr. Aquino-Simon joins the fray.Thirty-five seconds later, Mr. Aquino-Simon is seen on security camera video backing down the sidewalk toward the building that holds the gang\u2019s hangout, with L\u00e1zaro Mart\u00ednez and Miguel Mart\u00ednez following him. He hits L\u00e1zaro Mart\u00ednez twice before retreating again, with an unidentified man at his side. Mr. Rodr\u00edguez and Mr. Casta\u00f1eda arrive, and the four friends move in a group toward Mr. Aquino-Simon.One witness said Mr. Aquino-Simon ran into the building, vowing to his companion that he would kill someone, then returning to the sidewalk a minute later with a knife. A second witness saw Mr. Rodr\u00edguez and L\u00e1zaro Mart\u00ednez struggling to open the door of the building. Neither witness saw the stabbing itself. Both spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared reprisals from the Cholos.L\u00e1zaro Mart\u00ednez said he remembered standing on the sidewalk, fighting with Mr. Aquino-Simon and a second man, who had a cane, when Mr. Aquino-Simon\u2019s knife entered his side with a sickening thump. Then he blacked out, he said. Mr. Casta\u00f1eda, who declined to be interviewed, told detectives that he saw Mr. Aquino-Simon open the door of the building and thrust with a knife toward both Mr. Mart\u00ednez and Mr. Rodr\u00edguez as they stood on the landing. Blood was found inside the vestibule and just outside the door.\u201cEveryone remembers it differently; that\u2019s just the way it goes,\u201d said Rick Simplicio, the lead detective on the case. \u201cBut if they all put the same person in same area, we\u2019re good with that.\u201dMr. Aquino-Simon\u2019s lawyer, Todd A. Spodek, said his client was trapped between two doors in the vestibule, as Mr. Rodr\u00edguez and L\u00e1zaro Mart\u00ednez threatened him from outside, and Mr. Rodr\u00edguez waved a knife. He said Mr. Aquino-Simon opened the outer door to try to talk to Mr. Rodr\u00edguez, but the big man tried to push his way in, Mr. Spodek said. Fearing for his life, Mr. Aquino-Simon used a knife to defend himself, Mr. Spodek said.\u201cIt was a \u2018kill or be killed\u2019 situation,\u201d Mr. Spodek said.Detectives first thought the brawl had been prompted by a trivial insult at the bodega, when one of Mr. Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s friends was buying beer. \u201cAnd it just escalated,\u201d Sgt. Michael J. LoPuzzo, the commander of the 40th Precinct detective squad, said on May 20, a couple of weeks after the killing. \u201cNobody had to die here.\u201dThen came a twist. Detective Simplicio received a tip that Mr. Rodr\u00edguez had been feuding with the Cholos over his plans to testify in court that Mr. Aquino-Simon was responsible for the stabbing of a rival gang member in June 2015 at the Bronx Terminal Market. Mr. Rodr\u00edguez had made his decision to testify known in the neighborhood, giving Mr. Aquino-Simon a motive to silence him, said a defense lawyer for Baraquiel Castelan, the man charged in that case.\u201cHe couldn\u2019t keep a secret,\u201d the lawyer, Telesforo Del Valle Jr., said. \u201cHe was so upset about it.\u201dIn an interview at the Rikers Island jail complex, Mr. Castelan asserted his innocence, just as he said his friend Mr. Rodr\u00edguez would have. \u201cHonestly, I didn\u2019t do it,\u201d he said.Mr. Castelan denied being a gang leader, saying the Cholos were \u201cmore like friends than a gang.\u201d But the police said he took over as the leader of the Cholos in late 2013 after Miguel Castelan \u2014 a distant relative \u2014 was paralyzed in a shooting related to a long-running feud between the Cholos and the Vatos Locos.The twist had a complicated back story. Anthony Velazquez, now 25, a reputed Vatos Locos member, was attacked by at least eight men at the fair in the Bronx Terminal Market, according to a criminal complaint. Mr. Velazquez has a child with Baraquiel Castelan\u2019s sister. He told the police that Mr. Castelan had stabbed him after an argument over custody of the baby.Mr. Castelan said that he did not join in the attack and that Mr. Rodr\u00edguez would have exonerated him. Mr. Rodr\u00edguez had seen the fight because he had borrowed Mr. Castelan\u2019s car that day and brought several Cholos to the fair, including Mr. Aquino-Simon, he said. \u201cWe were all friends,\u201d Mr. Castelan said. \u201cWe know each other very well.\u201dMr. Rodr\u00edguez showed up at the courthouse along with other defense witnesses the day the grand jury met, several of Mr. Castelan\u2019s relatives said. He was discouraged from testifying after being informed he might open himself up to prosecution, but he intended to appear at Mr. Castelan\u2019s trial this fall, Mr. Del Valle said.The Bronx district attorney\u2019s office said it had no record that Mr. Rodr\u00edguez offered his testimony to the grand jury. Patrice O\u2019Shaughnessy, a spokeswoman for the office, said prosecutors had the testimony of the victim and a second witness, both of whom knew Mr. Castelan well enough to identify him as the assailant.Mr. Spodek said his client had nothing to do with the stabbing of Mr. Velazquez.Detective Simplicio and Sergeant LoPuzzo said time might reveal the motive for Mr. Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s murder. But for now, they have witnesses who say Mr. Aquino-Simon stabbed Mr. Rodr\u00edguez, and that is enough. \u201cI\u2019m satisfied with that,\u201d Sergeant LoPuzzo said.Mr. Castelan said he had once been close to Mr. Aquino-Simon, a son of Mexican immigrants who was raised by a single mother in the Wagner Houses in East Harlem. Mr. Aquino-Simon had shown up in Cholos territory around 2013 and befriended several members of the gang, hanging around at El Bravo, where Mr. Rodriguez worked, Mr. Castelan said.Though Mr. Aquino-Simon had good grades and ran track, he dropped out of high school his sophomore year, when his girlfriend became pregnant, his sister Miriam Aquino said. Intent on supporting his child, he delivered food for an Italian restaurant on East 86th Street. Later, he got a job working for a wholesale grocer in Hunts Point.Eric Chevere, a club manager and a lifelong resident of 151st Street, said Mr. Aquino-Simon had confided to him that he joined the Cholos for fear of other gangs. \u201cHe did it because he needed protection,\u201d Mr. Chevere said.But he also adopted the name Diablito, meaning \u201clittle devil.\u201d He started tagging lampposts and buildings along 151st Street with the letters CLS, for Cholos, people who knew him said. He was arrested three times over two years on felony charges, including robbery and assault, but the records of those proceedings are sealed because of his age, the police said.\u201cIf he sees you getting beat up,\u201d one former gang member said of Mr. Aquino-Simon, he is \u201cgoing to help you. That\u2019s the kind of friend he was.\u201dSince Mr. Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s death, the men who live in his apartment have avoided the street, shuttering themselves inside and declining interviews. Several said they were afraid of reprisals from the Cholos for speaking to the police. \u201cThis place is dangerous \u2014 it\u2019s hell out here,\u201d Miguel Mart\u00ednez said as he declined a request for an interview.The men who took part in the fight have moved away, and the remainder are facing eviction, the landlord said. Detective Simplicio acknowledged that it would be hard to track them down when the case comes to trial.In Mexico, Mr. Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s family buried him in a churchyard near his house, after raising money to transport his remains. His body was too wide for the standard coffin provided by the Mexican government.His sister Griselda wept in the family kitchen as she spoke about the sweet, rambunctious Mr. Rodr\u00edguez she knew. Nearby was a shrine she had built to her brother: four candles, a photograph of him wearing the Mexican flag as a bandanna, and two bunches of red and white roses. A doughnut and a cup of coffee sat next to the photo. \u201cBecause he liked them so much,\u201d she said.She recalled her brother\u2019s last phone call home in 2013, when he spoke to the son he hardly knew.\u201cAlan asked him, \u2018Daddy, when are you coming back?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBeto responded: \u2018Any day now. Any day.\u2019\u201dReporting was contributed by Sandra E. Garcia, Benjamin Mueller, Ashley Southall and Isvett Verde from New York, and Paulina Villegas from Tulancingo, Mexico. Susan C.

{"Headline": "Relaxing Privacy Vow, WhatsApp Will Share Some Data With Facebook", "Date": "2016-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwo years later, in a move that is rankling some of the company\u2019s more than one billion users, WhatsApp will soon begin to share some member information with Facebook.WhatsApp said on Thursday that it would start disclosing the phone numbers and analytics data of its users to Facebook. It will be the first time the messaging service has connected users\u2019 accounts to the social network to share data, as Facebook tries to coordinate information across its collection of businesses.Among the changes, Facebook will be able to use a person\u2019s phone number to improve other Facebook-operated services, such as making new Facebook friend suggestions, or better-tailored advertising, WhatsApp added. It said the data-sharing would also be used to fight spam text messages across its service.While WhatsApp operates autonomously from Facebook, Mr. Koum sits on Facebook\u2019s board.The changes were immediately viewed with a critical eye by some who were concerned when Facebook bought WhatsApp that their data could one day be misused. WhatsApp made early inroads with people worldwide partly for its hard-line stance on privacy and individual liberties, which was rooted in Mr. Koum\u2019s youth in the 1980s in the Soviet Union, where, he has said, he lived in fear of his communications being monitored. Mr. Koum has also been outspoken against advertising in the app in general.Many WhatsApp users have appreciated just how different the service is from Facebook. In some countries, like Brazil, WhatsApp\u2019s focus on privacy has led to criticism from law enforcement agencies that they cannot gain access to users\u2019 encrypted messages.\u201cOur values and our respect for your privacy continue to guide the decisions we make at WhatsApp,\u201d Mr. Koum said in a post on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s why we\u2019ve rolled out end-to-end encryption, which means no one can read your messages other than the people you talk to. Not us, not Facebook, nor anyone else.\u201dHe added, \u201cOur focus is the same as it\u2019s always been \u2014 giving you a fast, simple and reliable way to stay in touch with friends and loved ones around the world.\u201dWhatsApp\u2019s privacy policy overhaul raises concerns about potential legal challenges. Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a privacy advocacy group in Washington, said it would file a complaint on Monday with the Federal Trade Commission to stop WhatsApp from sharing users\u2019 data with Facebook. The group filed a similar case in 2014, citing promises that WhatsApp had made to protect individuals\u2019 privacy.\u201cMany users signed up for WhatsApp and not Facebook, precisely because WhatsApp offered, at the time, better privacy practices,\u201d Mr. Rotenberg said by email. \u201cIf the F.T.C. does not bring an enforcement action, it means that even when users choose better privacy services, there is no guarantee their data will be protected.\u201dFacebook has also been at the heart of a debate over how people\u2019s information held in Europe \u2014 the company\u2019s users outside the United States are regulated from Dublin \u2014 should be transferred to the United States.WhatsApp\u2019s new privacy policy may put it in the middle of this tussle, pushing the company to reassure concerned users about how Facebook may use their data.Mike Isaac reported from San Francisco and Mark Scott from Rome.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Much Does Donald Trump Pay in Taxes? It Could Be Zero", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseMitt Romney was excoriated during the 2012 presidential campaign for paying $4.9 million in federal income tax, or an average of just 14 percent of his adjusted gross income, in the two years for which he released returns.No one should be surprised, though, if Donald J. Trump has paid far less \u2014 perhaps even zero federal income tax in some years. Indeed, that\u2019s the expectation of numerous real estate and tax professionals I\u2019ve interviewed in recent weeks.Even with hundreds of millions in gross revenue from his vast real estate empire, \u201cit\u2019s both possible and legal that Donald Trump would pay little or no income tax,\u201d said Len Green, an accountant and chairman of the Green Group, a tax and accounting advisory firm. Mr. Green is also a real estate investor, teaches at Babson College and is the author of the forthcoming \u201cThe Entrepreneur\u2019s Playbook.\u201d\u201cI would expect he\u2019s paying little or no tax,\u201d agreed Steven M. Rosenthal, a veteran tax lawyer and senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy center.That\u2019s because Mr. Trump, as a prominent and active developer, can take advantage of some of the most generous tax breaks in the federal tax code to reduce his reported income to near zero, or even report a loss.Few tax advisers to major real estate developers would speak for attribution, because their clients benefit from the same tax breaks available to Mr. Trump. But all told me they knew developers in Mr. Trump\u2019s league who pay little or no income tax despite hundreds of millions in cash flow.\u201cReal estate is notorious for throwing off huge deductions,\u201d Mr. Rosenthal said. \u201cThat coupled with wide latitude in the timing and recognition of income make real estate development extremely attractive from a tax standpoint.\u201dThe Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment, nor did William F. Nelson, a former general counsel to the Internal Revenue Service and partner at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax lawyers.Mr. Trump has said in the past that highly paid corporate executives \u201cget away with murder\u201d on their taxes while boasting that he pays as little as the law allows. At the same time, he has insisted that his federal income tax payments are \u201csubstantial.\u201dNo one I spoke to has seen Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns, because he has not released them. One obvious potential reason is that he reports little or no taxable income, and thus pays very little to support the government he wants to run. He is not obligated by law to make his returns public, but every candidate since Richard Nixon refused to has done so. (Gerald Ford released summaries.) Mr. Romney was harshly criticized for releasing just two years\u2019 worth, and it became a major campaign issue four years ago.Even though his recent returns are confidential, the notion that Mr. Trump has paid little or no tax is not entirely speculative. It\u2019s consistent with Mr. Trump\u2019s returns from the late 1970s, which he filed with the New Jersey Casino Control Commission when applying for a casino license in 1981. Mr. Trump reported losses and paid no federal income tax in 1978 and 1979 and paid only modest sums \u2014 a total of less than $75,000 \u2014 for the prior three years.Their conclusions are reinforced by Mr. Trump\u2019s extensive financial disclosures required of presidential candidates. His latest filing in May lists 564 entities in which he holds a position, usually president, director or \u201cmember.\u201d Most are corporations, usually owned in turn by a limited liability company and associated with a specific Trump-owned property, such as the office tower at 40 Wall Street (the subject of four such L.L.C.s, each of which owns a major interest in the other). That does not count entities in which Mr. Trump does not hold any position.He lists 188 entries under \u201cemployment assets and income.\u201d Candidates are only required to list assets from which they earn more than $200; reporting money-losing ventures is optional.L.L.C.s pass on income tax-free (and, equally important, losses) to their owners. Real estate L.L.C.s can generate enormous losses, even with millions in revenue, because of depreciation, interest payments, real estate taxes and operating costs. Mr. Trump can use paper losses to offset taxable income, such as interest, dividends, royalties and employment income.That\u2019s a loophole that was eliminated for most investors in the landmark tax reform legislation in 1986. But because of aggressive lobbying by the powerful real estate industry, so-called active developers like Mr. Trump were exempted from restrictions on using such paper losses to offset ordinary income.The tax value of Mr. Trump\u2019s paper losses may well exceed his investment in the underlying properties, because he and other developers typically make minimal down payments and use as much debt as possible to finance a purchase. To take just one example, Mr. Trump bought what is now the Trump National Doral Miami resort and golf club for $150 million while it was in bankruptcy proceedings and financed the purchase with $125 million in loans from Deutsche Bank.Interest payments on mortgages and loans are deductible. How much total debt Mr. Trump\u2019s properties have incurred is not known, but based on his latest financial disclosure (which shows only ranges), it\u2019s at least $250 million and probably far more than that, with some estimates close to $1 billion. At an average interest rate of 4 percent, that deduction alone is worth at least $10 million a year and perhaps $40 million or more.At least interest is a cash payment. Depreciation is a noncash charge, and is largely an accounting conceit that benefits real estate investors. The theory is that real estate loses value over time and is eventually worthless. As everyone surely knows, most real estate has historically appreciated in value.How much Mr. Trump\u2019s property investments might throw off in depreciation depends on what he paid for them, how much he\u2019s spent on capital improvements and how the assets are categorized (some assets qualify for accelerated depreciation). But the 39-year depreciation schedule for commercial property, and purchases and capital investments of $2 billion (a modest estimate, given that Mr. Trump values his assets at $10 billion), would generate depreciation deductions of $50 million a year.Depreciation is ordinarily recaptured and taxed when an asset is sold. But Mr. Trump and other developers can benefit from provisions that make that unlikely. If they sell appreciated properties at a large profit but use the proceeds to buy other real estate, the transactions may be considered a \u201clike-kind\u201d exchange. If so, there\u2019s no tax on the gain.Critics have called like-kind exchanges an outrageous tax loophole that benefits wealthy real estate developers and other investors to the tune of $33 billion in lost tax revenue a year. The Obama administration has called for repealing it, and several bipartisan measures to do so have been introduced in Congress, all to no avail given the gridlock over tax reform.\u201cIt\u2019s a big loophole,\u201d Mr. Rosenthal said of the like-kind exchange provisions. \u201cIt allows well-to-do and well-advised taxpayers to defer their tax liability potentially until death.\u201dAlmost all presidential nominees since 1976 have made their tax returns public, most around Tax Day in April  \u2014 about 200 days before the election.Mr. Trump\u2019s business entities also deduct real estate taxes and all their operating costs and expenses, which might well include most of Mr. Trump\u2019s living and travel expenses, because his personal and business lives are so intertwined. (Even his suits are presumably a business cost, because he has a men\u2019s wear line.)\u201cThe difference between business and personal costs can be a very fine line,\u201d Mr. Green said, \u201cespecially for someone like Trump.\u201dThis may also explain why Mr. Trump has not disclosed many large charitable contributions, because the charitable deduction would be of scant value if he has little or no taxable income.The enormous tax benefits available to real estate developers like Mr. Trump make yet another a compelling case for overhauling the tax system. But that\u2019s not to say he\u2019s done anything wrong.\u201cPeople aren\u2019t obligated to pay taxes they don\u2019t owe,\u201d Mr. Green said. \u201cIt\u2019s the job of tax professionals to use every legal means to minimize taxes, and I\u2019m sure Trump has some of the best working for him. Many wealthy people pay no tax.\u201dBut they\u2019re not running for president.\u201cIt is disqualifying for a modern-day presidential nominee to refuse to release tax returns to the voters,\u201d Mitt Romney recently said on Facebook.He, of all people, should know.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of some business structures in which Mr. Trump holds a position. They are limited liability companies, not corporations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Charming Alternative Universe of You, Your Friends and No News", "Date": "2016-08-17", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtThis column is about escapist social networks, but let\u2019s start with Donald J. Trump because he seems more or less inescapable right now.In the few weeks since the introduction of Stories, Instagram seems to be on the path to becoming a different kind of place \u2014 a network where you can experience the most intimate and endearing moments of your friends\u2019 and acquaintances\u2019 lives in an environment blessedly free of the news.These are among a handful of apps that are creating a charming alternative universe online \u2014 a welcome form of earnest, escapist entertainment that makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside, in a way that recalls an earlier epoch in carefree internet socializing.\u201cThe irony is that if you\u2019d asked people in 2008 about Facebook, they would have said the same thing \u2014 that Facebook was the first thing that felt raw, personal and emotional rather than, \u2018Here\u2019s a link to another story about Donald Trump,\u2019\u201d said Josh Elman, a partner at the venture capital firm Greylock Partners. He has worked at Twitter and Facebook and is an investor in social apps including Musical.ly.But as Facebook became more popular, Mr. Elman said, it started to feel less reflexively \u201csafe.\u201d The more people who were on it, the more you had to pause to consider who and where your message was going out to and what the countless people who\u2019d be able to see it forever might think of you.That stands in stark contrast to some other social apps now. Take Snapchat, whose growth has been fueled by an insistence on authenticity. The app began in 2011 as a way to send pictures that disappear, a feature that lowered people\u2019s inhibitions (sometimes in worrying ways) and created a mind-set of pervasive, disarming goofiness.In 2013, Snapchat created Stories, which lets you turn your disappearing pictures into a kind of journal that would be displayed on your followers\u2019 timelines.Stories works like this: As you go about your day, you might snap a shot of yourself eating breakfast, walking the dog, going to work, making some dumb joke in the mirror or otherwise having a grand old time. Each of these sounds banal, but because the diaries expire after a day, and because it\u2019s video rather than text, people tend to be forthcoming about their lives \u2014 so you get a very intense, close connection with people of the sort that feels rare online.The differences are instructive. On Facebook, my friends will post about their promotions; on Snapchat, they tell you about their anxieties at work. On Facebook, they show off smiling photos of their perfect kids on some perfect vacation. On Snapchat, they show pictures of their kids in the midst of some disastrous tantrum, throwing food all over the floor, peeing in the tub, covered in mud and paint and food, because hey, that\u2019s life, O.K.?Kevin Systrom, one of Instagram\u2019s founders and its chief executive, told me that his company, which Facebook purchased in 2012, had long aspired to capture every moment of people\u2019s lives \u2014 both the showy ones and the casual, tossed-off moments in between. But the culture on Instagram, he said, was constrained by growth.\u201cAs we got bigger and bigger and bigger, people got more and more followers, including people you don\u2019t know following you,\u201d Mr. Systrom said. \u201cThen you have brands and celebrities posting more and more awesome photos. And you start to say to yourself: \u2018Can I exist in that world? Is this world right for me?\u2019\u201dThough Stories is only a few weeks old, I have already learned a lot about my friends. It turns out they do not live in perfect houses \u2014 some of theirs are as messy as mine \u2014 and don\u2019t always have perfectly combed hair. They don\u2019t always get things done; they sometimes eat less than stellar-looking food; their kids sometimes misbehave just as much as mine.Mr. Systrom had a similar verdict. \u201cI feel like I get to see all these people I\u2019ve known all these years, but now I actually get to hear from them and see what they do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just their beautiful photos, but it\u2019s who they are.\u201dWhether this lasts is another question. Instagram has 500 million users around the world, 300 million of whom use the app every day. Snapchat has 150 million daily active users. As these networks grow ever larger, even disappearing photos will be subject to anxiety \u2014 and people could well move on to other services where they feel more protected to show off their true selves.\u201cGive it a couple months, watch other people\u2019s stories, and then you\u2019re going to be like: \u2018Hmm, my kid threw up, I had to clean it up, I finally got her to bed and now I\u2019m just on the couch watching TV \u2014 I\u2019m just not going to share that,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Elman at Greylock. \u201cBecause your five other friends posted pictures from some great concert at the beach, and you can\u2019t compete.\u201dFor now, at least, I\u2019m enjoying watching people let their freak flag fly. In a strange way, loading up these escapist apps and watching friends and strangers act the fool feels wonderfully carefree, like a throwback to another old-fashioned pastime that has been outmoded by technology: channel-surfing on TV.There\u2019s a constant reality show on your phone, but an honest one, starring your friends. And Mr. Trump is nowhere to be found.Advertisement"}

The Qs had a lot to do with it, sneaking in there where Os should have been. But are they really Qs?I realized this would be a car theme when I first scanned the list of clues, but I was not prepared for the Qs, which substitute for the letter O in the four theme entries. At first, I thought they might represent a nail in the tire, but it turns out that the tail in the letter Q acts as a BOOT on all of these \u201cincapacitated\u201d car makes and models. To do this elegantly, Mr. Kaye had to find a set of car models that match each other\u2019s letter counts for symmetry, and which contain exactly one letter O.Here are the four \u201cincapacitated\u201d cars models:21A: \u201cIncapacitated Chevy?\u201d = SILVERADQ = SILVERADO25A: \u201cIncapacitated Ford?\u201d = EXPLQRER = EXPLORER46A: \u201cIncapacitated Jeep?\u201d = CHERQKEE = CHEROKEE52A: \u201cIncapacitated Lincoln?\u201d = NAVIGATQR = NAVIGATORI also liked how Mr. Kaye \u201cBOOTed\u201d the entire grid by placing the revealer, BOOT (59D), at the most lower-right-hand Down entry, just the way his other BOOTs look.\u2022 18A: I don\u2019t typically place bets on jai alai, but I was able to guess this one, because I already had TRI- and TRIFECTA was the closest word that I knew to betting.\u2022 34A and 36A: We have a couple of entries next to each other (ARETE and EWER) that could be seen as crosswordese, but it\u2019s Thursday, so you\u2019re going to see some words in the puzzle that are less common.\u2022 61A: You might have been thinking about Herbert Hoover for Roosevelt predecessor, but not today; the only predecessor we\u2019re looking for is within Roosevelt\u2019s own name, and that\u2019s DELANO.\u2022 38D: The designer Eero SAARINEN\u2019s first name comes up quite a bit in crosswords, but today you need to know his surname.Let\u2019s hear from Mr. Kaye, who has clearly gotten too big for his britches:This was my first crossword accepted by The New York Times \u2014 so exciting!

{"Headline": "Talking to Terrorists", "Date": "2016-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI\u2019ve been talking to terrorists as part of my beat on and off for the past four years.Except for one Qaeda spokesman who operated in the ribbon of sand between Mali and Libya and allowed me and other journalists to call him on his cellphone, nearly all the interactions have been via social media: We exchanged direct messages on Twitter and Facebook, or on encrypted apps like Telegram, Threema and Kik.These jihadists presented themselves to me using names I knew were not the ones on their birth certificates. Their profile pictures were never real images of them; one Qaeda operative with whom I spent months exchanging messages appeared as a silhouette of a hooded man holding a sword that dripped with blood.And all this time, I struggled with one of the basic rules of journalism: Could I be sure these men were who they said they were? Often I was able to confirm their identities only after they had died in drone strikes and the terror group released a martyrdom video or statement. I came to know well the jihadists with whom I corresponded the longest, and the details they shared, including statements before they were officially released by their respective organizations, convinced me that they were indeed who they said they were. But knowing something in your gut and being able to prove it in accordance with the standards of my profession are two different things, so the majority of these jihadists were never quoted in my articles.During a short trip to southern Turkey in late 2014, several defectors from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, agreed to meet me in malls and smoke-filled cafes. I finally had real human beings in front of me, but they again refused to give their real names. And when I tried to corroborate their accounts, almost nothing they said could be verified. Colleagues shared stories of fixers who paid Syrians to pose as members of the Islamic State, coaching them on what to say, which made the exercise even more fraught.But as a reporter who is energized by being in the field, I felt frustrated by the lack of human contact.In Germany last week, I finally had a chance to meet an Islamic State operative whose identity and membership in the terror group was independently confirmed by investigators and through a propaganda video he filmed in Syria, showing him alongside other German recruits taking part in a staged execution of prisoners.How I got the interview was partly a fluke: A longtime source whose opinion I value pointed me to the case of Harry Sarfo, and encouraged me to dig into his story. That\u2019s because Mr. Sarfo was not just a run-of-the-mill member of the Islamic State; he was recruited into its grueling special forces training camp, where foot soldiers live in caves and spend hours running, jumping and crawling through the desert, all on less than one glass of water a day. Crucially, because of his German nationality and because he used to live in London, Mr. Sarfo was aggressively courted by a secretive unit inside the organization responsible for dispatching foreigners to carry out attacks in Europe. He repeatedly said no to them, he later recounted. But as they continued to try to entice him, he learned key details about the goals and day-to-day functioning of the covert unit, known as the Emni, from the Arabic word for security.So last month, I flew to northern Germany and took a train to the city of Bremen. There I met the German intelligence agent who had debriefed Mr. Sarfo soon after his arrest in July 2015. The agent, Hazim Fouad, described how Mr. Sarfo spoke nonstop for 90 minutes, as the coffee put out for him in a Styrofoam cup went cold. Later, through a different source, I was able to get the more than 500 pages of his interrogation transcript and saw for myself the enormous detail he provided, down to how the water tank at the special forces training camp had been \u201cpainted\u201d in mud to be invisible to drones.Other reporters, including those from the BBC and the Independent, had interviewed Mr. Sarfo remotely, sending questions to his lawyer, who in turn took them to Mr. Sarfo\u2019s cell, where he prepared handwritten responses. One German TV station and one German radio station had gotten in-person interviews, but they focused heavily on what was of interest to a German public: Mr. Sarfo\u2019s radicalization at a local mosque, his interaction with well-known German jihadists in Syria, and the Islamic State\u2019s desire to attack Germany.To me, Mr. Sarfo presented a golden opportunity to understand the terror group\u2019s plan for creating a global portfolio of killers.I met Mr. Sarfo\u2019s jovial attorney, Udo W\u00fcrtz, in his stately office, decorated with African art. I asked him if I could get into the jail for an extended sit-down interview, and he gave me the number of an official in Germany\u2019s ministry of justice. We reached out, expecting to be stonewalled, as has happened time and again when I have tried to interview Islamic State and Qaeda prisoners in American jails. Our luck was good: We requested the interview just days before Mr. Sarfo ended one year in solitary confinement. He was released into the general prison population on Friday, July 29. To my surprise, the ministry said I could meet with him three days later, on Monday, August 1.The prison had reserved the room normally used for conjugal visits for our interview. Over the course of three hours, my video colleagues moved the couch, took down the drapes and strung lights from the ceiling to turn it into a studio.I spent that time visiting the jail with its warden, Gerd Koop. When I met Mr. Koop, I understood why this incredible opportunity had fallen into our laps. A plaque outside the maximum-security facility summed up its philosophy: \u201cThere is no better way to awaken the good in people than to treat them as if they were already good.\u201dAlthough the prison holds convicted murderers, and now a member of the Islamic State\u2019s elite killing squad, I saw no handcuffs or ankle chains. Cell doors are encased in glass rather than bars, because Mr. Koop says studies have shown that cage-like enclosures foster aggression. There are exercise rooms with stationary bikes and pull-up bars on every floor, and a track across the beautiful grounds where you can hear birds singing. With the exception of the 10 prisoners in solitary confinement, inmates are free to come and go. There\u2019s an annual film festival that\u2019s open to the community where inmates sit side-by-side with the general public, wearing civilian clothes.When Mr. Sarfo walked into our makeshift studio, he beamed a smile. He warmly shook our hands. I sat close enough to touch him.Advertisement"}

People already tend to distrust politicians, and it\u2019s even harder to project an authentic self on social media. On top of that, people think of Mrs. Clinton as calculating and untrustworthy. How can someone like that sound like a real person online?Mrs. Clinton\u2019s legion of online content producers have been hard at work, putting together video clips and writing listicles to expand the former first lady and secretary of state\u2019s bona fides. Scroll through Mrs. Clinton\u2019s Facebook feed, and you\u2019ll see posts talking about the Zika virus and the recent flooding in Louisiana, highlighting the accomplishments of female Olympians, criticizing Mr. Trump for refusing to release his tax returns, and wishing her husband a happy birthday.\u201cWe\u2019re not competing with Donald Trump on Facebook,\u201d said Teddy Goff, who served as President Obama\u2019s digital director in 2012 and is now managing Mrs. Clinton\u2019s online presence. \u201cWe\u2019re competing with your best friend, your spouse, your mom, last night\u2019s Olympics clips.\u201dMrs. Clinton may be beating Mr. Trump in the polls, but he outpaces her on social media: 11 million Facebook \u201clikes\u201d to her 5.5 million; 11 million Twitter followers to her 8.4 million.

The pop singer Katy Perry has 92 million Twitter followers.)Laura Olin, who ran the Obama campaign\u2019s social media operation in 2012 and now works as a consultant to the Clinton campaign, said the podcast is a way to make Mrs. Clinton a more approachable figure.\u201cIt\u2019s such a cool way to humanize Hillary in a way that has been a struggle in a lot of ways,\u201d Ms. Olin said. \u201cShe sounds like your mom\u2019s smartest friend.\u201dRunning for president is hard, and we often expect candidates to perform in ways that have no real bearing on the actual job qualifications.

{"Headline": "New York Times to Shelve NYT Now App", "Date": "2016-08-18", "News": "Supported byIn early 2014, The New York Times introduced an app called NYT Now that would provide a curated list of stories \u2014 for a lower price than a full digital subscription \u2014 to what it hoped would be a younger, mobile-savvy audience. Jill Abramson, then the executive editor of The Times, unveiled the app at the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Tex.NYT Now was among the first attempts by The Times to enhance its appeal to mobile users as it looked for new revenue sources that would offset drops in print advertising and circulation. By giving readers a curated subset of daily articles in a mobile-friendly, lower-priced package, The Times hoped to attract a broader audience that might otherwise not subscribe. The subscription price for NYT Now, $8 a month, was roughly half the price of the least expensive digital subscription.But the app never quite took off as The Times had hoped, and last year, it transitioned from subscription to free in the hopes that the new model might give The Times more of an opportunity to expand its audience.Kinsey Wilson, the executive vice president for product and technology, said the decision to do away with NYT Now was driven in part by a shift in how the company thinks about broadening its audience. The Times, with the help of its audience development team, now looks more to third-party platforms like Facebook and Twitter to expand its reach among younger readers.\u201cThat gave us a different ability to tap into younger audiences and to provide exposure to a much, much wider audience,\u201d Mr. Wilson said.Many features of NYT Now \u2014 including morning and evening news briefings, bullet-point lists and a more conversational tone \u2014 have also been incorporated into The Times\u2019s main news products, including the core mobile app, he said.At its peak, in May 2015, NYT Now had 334,000 total unique users. The app averaged 257,000 unique users in the last three months.NYT Now is not the first app The Times has retired. In 2014, it shut down NYT Opinion because it failed to gain much traction.

{"Headline": "She Swam to Escape Syria. Now She\u2019ll Swim in Rio.", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 Yusra Mardini, an Olympic swimmer, was an hour and a half into her first training session of the day, butterfly-kicking down the length of a pool with a yellow rubber duck balanced on her head.Other young swimmers shared the lane, but Mardini, 18, kept her own pace, darting down the center, emerging at the edge of the pool from time to time to exchange the duck \u2014 used for balance training \u2014 for a snorkel or a kickboard.Everything about Mardini\u2019s route to the Rio Games has been unlikely. She will compete on the first refugee team at an Olympics, a feat that was unthinkable less than a year ago when she was neck-deep in the Mediterranean Sea swimming for her life.Last August, Mardini and her sister Sarah fled war-torn Syria and embarked on a harrowing, monthlong journey through Lebanon, Turkey and Greece, up through the Balkans and Central Europe, to Germany, narrowly dodging capture and death. When their crammed dinghy broke down between Turkey and Greece, she and her sister, also a swimmer, jumped into the water and helped guide the boat to safety.Mardini\u2019s story came to public attention in March when she was identified by the International Olympic Committee as a candidate to compete on a new team of refugees, made up of athletes who are stateless or would otherwise be excluded from the Games. She was thrust into the spotlight, celebrated by the news media as a fresh-faced example of Germany\u2019s so-called welcome culture \u2014 a story of uplift at the center of the global refugee crisis.Mardini was officially named to the refugee team in June along with nine athletes from Syria, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Ethiopia. The team will compete under the Olympic flag and anthem, entering the Maracan\u00e3 stadium on Friday for the opening ceremony next to last, just before host Brazil. Mardini will compete in the 100-meter freestyle and the 100-meter butterfly.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be really cool,\u201d she said, throwing a hot-pink Nike backpack onto a table in the cafeteria of the training center.She had found out a few weeks earlier that she had made the Olympic team from a group of journalists who had come to the apartment where she now lives with her sister.\u201cBecause actually I never open my emails,\u201d Mardini said.Then, she said, the journalists told her that a friend of hers, Rami Anis, also a Syrian swimmer, had made the team as well. \u201cThat\u2019s when it was like, Ahh!\u201d Mardini said.Mardini had changed into a zip-up hooded sweatshirt (a gift from the German swimwear brand Arena) and blow-dried her hair into shimmery, past-the-shoulder layers. In each ear she wore two studs: a pearl and a rhinestone.Mardini swings between frenetic, uncontainable excitement and half-bored preoccupation. She sends text messages frequently. In other words, she is a normal teenager.\u201cWhen I was a little kid, I was just put into the water,\u201d said Mardini, who grew up in the Daraya suburb of Damascus. Her father, a swimming coach, began training her when she was 3. Mardini went on to compete for the Syrian national team and received support from the Syrian Olympic Committee.But then war broke out in 2011, when she was 13, and Mardini saw her relatively idyllic life begin to transform.\u201cAll the sudden you couldn\u2019t go where you wanted, or your mom calls you when you\u2019re on your way and says, \u2018Come back; there\u2019s something happening there,\u2019\u201d she said.School would be canceled for several days, she said, \u201cor someone is shooting, and then you have to run.\u201dYet within the world of her friends and classmates, Mardini said, life for the most part went on as usual. \u201cWe never talked about the war,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was annoying! In the beginning, everyone talked about it, but then after a few years, we were like: \u2018O.K., if I\u2019m going to die, I\u2019m going to die! But let me live my life. I want to see my friends!\u2019\u201d\u201cI told my mom, \u2018O.K., enough is enough,\u2019\u201d Mardini said. \u201cAnd she said, \u2018Fine, find someone I can trust to take you, and you can go.\u2019\u201dOn Aug. 12, 2015, Mardini and her sister left with two of their father\u2019s cousins and another friend. They flew from Damascus to Beirut, Lebanon, to Istanbul, where they connected with smugglers and a group of about 30 refugees with whom they stayed for the duration of the journey.The group was bused to Izmir, Turkey, and then taken to a wooded area near the seaside to wait to board a boat to the Greek island Lesbos.\u201cWe thought we were the only bus, but there were four or five busloads every day,\u201d Mardini said. \u201cThere were 200, 300 people there, everyone waiting until there are no police in the sea so they can go.\u201dAt night, helicopters patrolled the area, she said, but the Turkish authorities never entered the forest.\u201cThe police are afraid because the smugglers have guns,\u201d Mardini said. The smugglers, she said, \u201cwere not afraid.\u201dAfter four days, Mardini and her sister were packed with 18 other people, including a 6-year-old boy, on a dinghy meant to accommodate six. On their first attempt, they were caught by border agents and sent back. On their second, the engine died after about 20 minutes, and the dinghy took on water.Of the 20 people on board, only the Mardini sisters and two young men knew how to swim, so the four of them jumped overboard. It was about 7 at night, and the turning tide had made the sea harsh and choppy.\u201cEveryone was praying,\u201d Mardini said. \u201cWe were calling the Turkish police, the Greek police, saying: \u2018Please, please help us. We have children! We are drowning!\u2019 And they just kept saying: \u2018Turn and go back. Turn and go back.\u2019\u201dMardini and her sister swam for three and a half hours, helping the boat stay on course \u2014 even when the two male swimmers gave up and let the dinghy pull them along. It was cold, Mardini said. Her clothes dragged her down, and salt burned her eyes and skin.\u201cI\u2019m thinking, what? I\u2019m a swimmer, and I\u2019m going to die in the water in the end?\u201d she said.But she was determined to keep a good attitude \u2014 and not just for her own sake.\u201cThe little kid kept looking at me, scared,\u201d she said, \u201cso I was doing all these funny faces.\u201dEventually the boat made it to shore in Lesbos, but the journey was only beginning. The people in the group walked for days at a time, sleeping in fields or churches. Even though they had money, taxis refused to stop for them, and restaurants often refused them service.\u201cBut there were good people, too,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I arrived, I didn\u2019t have any shoes, and there was a Greek girl \u2014 I think, the same age as me \u2014 and she saw us and gave us a pullover for the young kid, and she gave me her shoes.\u201dThe sisters traveled by foot or on buses run by smugglers from Greece through Macedonia up through Serbia and into Hungary. They were in Budapest in September when Hungarian authorities closed the main train station to refugees. Many, including the Mardini sisters, had spent hundreds of euros on train tickets that they were then prohibited from using, prompting hundreds of refugees to protest outside the station.\u201cI was just watching,\u201d Mardini said. \u201cI was like: \u2018Where am I? And what\u2019s going to happen if they take me to jail now?\u2019\u201dEventually they made it out of Hungary, traveling through Austria and finally to Germany, where they ended up in a refugee camp in Berlin sharing a tent with six men they had traveled with.\u201cI was happy!\u201d Mardini said, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t have any problems. I\u2019m in Germany. I have my sister. That\u2019s it.\u201dThe Mardini sisters spent much of their first German winter waiting in long lines at the main refugee registry point \u2014 the State Office of Health and Social Affairs, known by its German acronym, Lageso \u2014 to get their asylum papers in order. They often had to wait outside for eight hours in freezing temperatures only to be turned away and told to come back the next day.\u201cHere in Lageso, I cried more than during the trip,\u201d Mardini said.At first, getting back in the water was the last thing on her mind, but after some weeks, she said, she began to long for it \u2014 especially when she heard a fellow competitor had won a competition in Asia.\u201cI was like: \u2018Mom! Ahh! I should be there! I\u2019m better than her!\u2019\u201d she said.An Egyptian interpreter who helped out frequently at the refugee camp connected Mardini with nearby Wasserfreunde Spandau, and Sven Spannekrebs, a longtime trainer for the club, agreed to give her a tryout. When he saw Mardini swim, Spannekrebs said, he was impressed.\u201cThe technical foundation was really good,\u201d said Spannekrebs, who joined Mardini in the cafeteria for lunch after her morning swim. \u201cAfter two years without training, it was just that the aerobic foundation was not good. Her body was in bad shape.\u201d\u201cI was not that bad!\u201d Mardini said, dropping her cutlery in protest. He shot her an exaggerated look of incredulity. She grinned and conceded, \u201cO.K., 25 days eating Burger King and McDonald\u2019s.\u201dNot long after he started training Mardini, Spannekrebs became convinced she could be a candidate for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. But when they learned the International Olympic Committee might be building a refugee team, he and Mardini realized her Olympic dreams could come true sooner than expected. In January, the committee granted her a training scholarship, and Spannekrebs started Mardini on a rigorous daily schedule: two two-hour sessions in the water and another hour of dry-land aerobic training, with school sessions in between.\u201cShe\u2019s a really tough athlete,\u201d he said.A medal in Rio is out of reach. Mardini\u2019s fastest times are 1 minute 8 seconds in the 100-meter butterfly and 1:02 in the 100-meter freestyle, a good nine and 11 seconds behind the official Olympic qualifying times for those events.\u201cI\u2019m expecting personal best,\u201d Mardini said.Mardini used some of the scholarship money to get an apartment with her sister not too far from the training center. Her parents and her two younger sisters have now joined them in Berlin, and the whole family has been granted temporary asylum.Mardini said she would like to use the attention she had received to help other refugees. Eventually she hopes to return to Syria to share her story with people there.\u201cI remember everything, of course,\u201d she said. \u201cI never forget. But it\u2019s the thing that\u2019s pushing me actually to do more and more.\u201dShe added, \u201cCrying in the corner, that\u2019s just not me.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thousands Displaced in Storm-Drenched Louisiana", "Date": "2016-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter days of ruinously heavy storms in southern Louisiana, rain-swollen rivers and creeks continued wreaking damage across the state, inundating neighborhoods and submerging roads and highways.More than 20,000 people have had to be rescued from the flooding this weekend, Louisiana officials said, in a waterlogged stretch from the parishes to the north and east of Baton Rouge west past the city of Lafayette. Thousands of homes have been flooded, forcing more than 10,000 people into shelters. Those stranded by the waters found themselves further marooned by a massive cellular network failure.Parts of major roadways became islands, including a stretch of interstate where hundreds of drivers had been stranded for over 24 hours, officials said. The governor\u2019s office said that all the motorists had been rescued by Sunday evening.On Sunday evening, President Barack Obama spoke with the Governor John Bel Edwards, to say his request for an emergency declaration had been granted for the state\u2019s flood response and recovery efforts, a spokeswoman for the administration said.While the drenching thunderstorms that led to the flooding have lessened in intensity and largely moved from the areas most severely affected, the disaster is hardly over. As the swollen rivers roll south and fill tributaries and backwaters, new places are expected to flood, highlighting the most difficult part of this event: that past experience has served as such a poor guide.\u201cThe simple fact of the matter here is we\u2019re breaking records,\u201d Mr. Edwards said to reporters on Sunday. \u201cAnd any time you break a record, the National Weather Service cannot tell you what you can expect in the way of the floodwaters: how wide they\u2019re going to be and how deep they\u2019re going to be.\u201dEven in a part of the country long used to living with high waters, this was, as Mr. Edwards said, a \u201chistoric, unprecedented flooding event.\u201d Previous knowledge about which areas tend to go underwater and which stay dry was rendered useless.\u201cWhat was going on last night especially around two and three o\u2019clock in the morning sounded exactly like Katrina,\u201d said Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor\u2019s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, talking of the chatter of emergency medical workers over the radio. \u201cIt got so bad that, as they were moving in buses and other vehicles to move people, there was concern about getting the people on board in time because the flooding was coming so fast.\u201dMr. Steele went through the damage estimates by parish \u2014 1,000 homes in East Baton Rouge, 1,000 homes in Livingston, 500 in Tangipahoa and so on \u2014 but stressed that any tally was already out of date. \u201cGuaranteed that number\u2019s higher today than it was last night,\u201d he said.The flooding in many places was worse than a seemingly exceptional statewide inundation a few months ago, and some of the state\u2019s rivers were cresting at several feet above record levels set in a devastating flood event in 1983.Like many others in southern Louisiana, the hundreds who were forced to stay overnight in their cars on a stretch of Interstate 12 were surrounded by a dangerously confounding new topography. Deep pockets of water were broken up by areas of dry land, which gave way again to deep pockets of water.\u201cYou can get on a boat and you can get a little bit closer, but at some point, you run out of water and there\u2019s land again,\u201d said Trooper Bryan Lee of the Louisiana State Police. \u201cSo many places are cut off we can\u2019t get resources to them.\u201dMore than 1,700 National Guardsmen were involved in response and rescue efforts as of Sunday morning, with 2,000 expected to join the work.Areas around Baton Rouge saw some of the worst flooding, making a summer that had already been trying that much more difficult. But the emphasis on Sunday, made by the governor and others, was on the cooperation that has sprung up amid the disaster at hand.\u201cThis is my giving back,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd thank y\u2019all for helping me.\u201dGardiner Harris contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Transgender on the Force", "Date": "2016-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter years of focused preparation, Aiden Budd was well on his way to fulfilling his lifelong dream of becoming an officer in the New York Police Department. He had served in the United States Army and had worked for years as an agent in the department\u2019s School Safety division. He studied for the exam to be promoted and he passed.He was set to start at the Police Academy on July 7, 2015.But first, there was something else he felt he had to accomplish. When he became a recruit, he wanted to be recognized officially as Aiden Budd, male police officer \u2014 settling, at least legally, a question of identity he had struggled with since he was a child.He had grown up as a girl in the Wakefield neighborhood in the Bronx, the oldest of three children in a West Indian family. He could tell early on that something did not feel right. It went beyond being a tomboy, the one student in his all-girls Catholic high school who refused to wear a skirt, even though it meant detention almost every day. Even after he came out to his family as a lesbian in high school, he felt an overwhelming discontent that continued into adulthood, poisoning his personal relationships.\u201cI couldn\u2019t find happiness with myself,\u201d Officer Budd, now 33, said. \u201cThere was something missing.\u201dHe had to come out again. He was transgender, and about a year before he started at the academy, a time of exams and interviews and extensive digging into his background, he began his transition to physically becoming a man. \u201cI\u2019ll put it like this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a rebirth.\u201dHe knew his decision had the potential to jeopardize his relationship with his family, one that had been strained since he came out the first time. And as he followed his uncle, a father figure, into law enforcement, Officer Budd feared that his identity would keep him from being accepted into the fraternity of police officers.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be judged before they got to know me as a person,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be a science project.\u201dStill, he pushed ahead.\u201cWe look at the individual for who they are,\u201d said Deputy Inspector Joseph Simonetti, the commanding officer of the Sixth Precinct, which covers Greenwich Village. \u201cWe\u2019re all cops,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re all police officers.\u201dBut officers coming to terms with their gender identity said they faced a dilemma. Those who delay making the transition while on the force face the corrosive toll of living what feels like a fraudulent life; those who do make it risk being rejected from the tight-knit fellowship of law enforcement that was also central to their identity.Denise Dragos, who had been a detective in the Police Department investigating computer crimes, put off transitioning to female from male until after she retired two years ago. She worried how colleagues would react. \u201cIt was going to be difficult,\u201d Ms. Dragos, 43, said. \u201cThings are changing in leaps and bounds over the last several years, but even four or five years ago, it didn\u2019t seem in the scope of possibility.\u201dNow, after she wore a No. 2 buzz cut for two decades, her hair reaches to her shoulders. A judge signed off on her name change in June. And she came out last year to a group of her former colleagues, though not in a way she had anticipated.Ms. Dragos had maintained dual lives on social media. On Facebook, she kept her old \u201cboy\u201d page, as she called it, and one for her new life as a woman. Then, she said, her \u201cgirl\u201d page showed up on the list of suggested friends of a police colleague, who took a screen shot and posted it in a group message, noting a resemblance.Some thought it was a joke.Ms. Dragos was traveling and received a text message from someone in the thread, asking if she had seen it. She recalled feeling a range of emotions: anger, fear, nervousness. But also relief.She decided she had to tell them.\u201cSo \u2026 Yes, that\u2019s me,\u201d she wrote in a group message. \u201cI have known this about myself for many years now, and kept it hidden deep down inside. I am now at a point in my life where I have thought about all of my options. I\u2019m going forward and have decided to take the step so you know this isn\u2019t a decision that was made overnight.\u201cI\u2019m happy, and that\u2019s what it is.\u201dThe initial surprise and confusion gave way to support. People who had made the earlier remarks apologized. Others encouraged her. And then, the conversation in the thread turned to baseball. She came out to other friends and acquaintances this summer, changing her name on social media to Denise and posting a picture of herself from a pride event.\u201cThat was a very stressful experience, coming out that way,\u201d Ms. Dragos said. \u201cBut it turned around and was one of the best things that happened for me.\u201dTcops International, or the Transgender Community of Police and Sheriffs, started in the late 1990s as a support group for a small network of officers to share their experiences online. For many of them, fears about coming out or transitioning were rooted in a harsh reality.But some have expressed optimism, believing that a broader cultural shift in the acceptance of transgender people was finding its way into policing. \u201cOfficers hired in the past five to 10 years have a better understanding of who we are,\u201d said Julie Callahan, a founder of Tcops International, who retired after 30 years as a police officer in San Jose, Calif.\u201cMore and more people will understand that we\u2019re not villains,\u201d she said, noting that the exposure many veteran officers had to transgender people was limited to interactions on the job, negatively shading their impressions. \u201cThey see sex workers, they see drug abusers, they see people stealing to support their habit or to survive,\u201d she added. \u201cThey translate their experiences with those people to all transgender people.\u201dOfficer Brooke Bukowski of the New York Police Department got her start in what police officers call an \u201cA-House,\u201d one of the precincts in New York where crime and violence persists, the kind of place where young officers can earn their stripes. After the academy, she was assigned to the 75th Precinct, which covers the East New York section of Brooklyn and has consistently had one of the highest murder rates in the city.Officer Bukowski, a United States Coast Guard veteran who was raised in rural Illinois, had started taking a low dose of hormones to transition before she joined the Police Department five years ago. She stopped when she entered the academy.But once she graduated, she resumed taking the hormones. When she moved to the 70th Precinct, in Flatbush, her transition became more apparent. Her hair grew longer, and her body changed. While she was on patrol, people on the street would refer to her as Miss, and she remembered overhearing two men in custody discussing her. \u201cThey literally start arguing over what gender I am,\u201d she said.She reached a point where she was \u201cmale failing,\u201d as she put it, a term in the transgender community meaning one could no longer pass as male. And after speaking with her superiors, she addressed roll call, explaining her transition.\u201cListen guys, I still have the same work ethic,\u201d Officer Bukowski, 33, recalled telling them. \u201cI\u2019m still going to back you up. It\u2019s just a few physical changes here and there.\u201dHer colleagues have mostly been supportive and encouraging. But there have been obstacles, mostly bureaucratic encounters within the department. For instance, she had a hard time getting a new identification card. She was told she was not due for one yet, though her appearance had drastically changed. (She eventually got a new card.) And around the time that Ms. Jenner appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair, Officer Bukowski was working on a detail with an older officer who made disparaging remarks about transgender people, unaware that Officer Bukowski was herself transgender. She opted to quietly finish the shift without saying anything. \u201cI had an hour left with the guy,\u201d she said.Because of her experiences, Officer Bukowski felt a pull to be open in the department and to help train other officers, even if it went against a competing urge to keep quiet, working as a woman and going home to her boyfriend. \u201cYou go through a lot all your life, so when you finally get there and you\u2019re lucky enough to pass,\u201d she said, a large part of her wanted just to embrace it.\u201cThey just see me as any other female,\u201d she said.For most of the past three years, Officer Bukowski has helped to train recruits at the Police Academy on transgender issues, replacing the video that had been shown when she was there.She is now assigned to the Sixth Precinct, and Inspector Simonetti praised the energy she has brought to her work, and her instincts as an officer. He added that the department also benefited by having officers with life experiences like hers, who can establish a dialogue with a group of New Yorkers who have viewed the police with suspicion. \u201cIt opens up avenues or lines of communication that in years past may not have been there,\u201d he said.Still, in a department with 36,000 uniformed police officers, Officer Bukowski is part of subset that is virtually microscopic. She said she had met a few other transgender officers; only one of them is out. \u201cAs far as the open community,\u201d Officer Bukowski said, \u201cit\u2019s Aiden and I, as far as we know.\u201dAiden chose his name because it did not strike him as overly masculine. He figured it would help soften the impact for his family.As the academy approached, Officer Budd said he was in a mad dash \u2014 changing his name and gender on official records and almost everywhere else that had his former identity on file.He pulled it off: On July 7, he was Aiden Budd, male recruit. He fit in well and became the company sergeant, a position of leadership among fellow recruits. \u201cThey took to him pretty quick,\u201d said Officer Ayesha Marty, an instructor in the academy. \u201cThey respected him.\u201dBut in his push to transition, he made an ambitious move: Two weeks in, he scheduled his \u201ctop surgery,\u201d a procedure in which breasts are removed and the chest is recontoured. He told fellow recruits he needed to have a growth removed.After he returned, he pulled his company aside and told them he was transgender. \u201cI thought it was important for them to know that part of myself,\u201d he said. They responded positively and without much of a fuss, he said.Officer Budd has an easygoing manner with a broad smile. He looks young for 33, so much so that fellow officers have given him the nickname \u201cBenjamin Button,\u201d after the character who ages in reverse. His fianc\u00e9e, Idalia Sumpter, said he was genuine and had a self-assurance that made people feel comfortable around him. But Officer Budd\u2019s transition has been transformative in more ways than physical, Ms. Sumpter said. He wasn\u2019t always so confident. \u201cHe has come a long, long way,\u201d she said, laughing.His struggles with identity had been a source of pain and confusion. As a teenager, he was outed as a lesbian when his mother found notes from a high school crush. After high school, he enlisted in the Army as a woman, but that was in the era of \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell,\u201d a policy that allowed gay and lesbian soldiers to serve, but not openly, and he said he was discharged after almost a year because of his sexual orientation. (After the policy was rescinded, he re-enlisted as a reservist, still as a woman.)\u201cI remember asking God a couple of times as a child why I wasn\u2019t born a boy,\u201d Officer Budd said. \u201cIf he knew how I felt, why didn\u2019t he just make it happen that way, to avoid all these issues with me liking women and me wanting to be in men\u2019s apparel and doing boy things?\u201d\u201cI never really got that answer as a kid,\u201d he continued. \u201cI kept those feelings to myself.\u201dHis transition has not been without hurdles. Some family members had a hard time. His sister, with whom he is very close, looked at it at first as if she were losing a sister. His uncle, whom Officer Budd considers his role model, did not attend his graduation.But that unsettled feeling that had rankled for most of his life has faded. He has been surprised by the people who stuck by him, including his great-grandmother. He and Ms. Sumpter, who met while working as school safety agents, plan to marry next year. On Dec. 29, 2015, he graduated from the academy, accomplishing that lifelong goal. He aspires to someday make detective.And in July, he said, he went on his first training exercise as an Army reservist since his transition, staying in the male barracks without issue.Even as more women have joined the police force, many officers still talk of their profession as a brotherhood, and it is one that Officer Budd wants to be part of. Anxieties over acceptance still linger as more of his colleagues learn of his background. \u201cI think I\u2019m only worried about not being man enough,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce somebody finds out the truth, they may think, like, \u2018Oh, this guy\u2019s not really man enough \u2014 what does he know about being a man?\u2019\u201dHe added that he was learning that \u201ca lot of it is my own fear.\u201dSince his graduation from the academy, Officer Budd has been assigned to the 20th Precinct in Manhattan, spending most of his time on the streets of the Upper West Side. One officer heard a rumor that he was transgender and gently asked about it. Officer Budd was certain others knew as well. But as he starts his career, his focus has been on building a good reputation, earning the trust of other officers. \u201cLike any other rookie, you want the guys to know you as a good cop,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing else.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Many of the migrants, fleeing war-torn countries and landing by boat, were women and children whose needs posed special challenges to the European Union, the United Nations and various nongovernmental organizations struggling to cope. Amid the hundreds of photographers covering the humanitarian crisis, Ms. Dorigny focused exclusively on female migrants from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq. She photographed women as they landed, through processing by the European Union and then as they journeyed to Germany, a country where many of them were to be settled \u00e2\u0080\u0094 at least temporarily.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are no more magazines that will send us on humanitarian social stories,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ms. Dorigny, who has worked as a photojournalist since 1989. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care anymore and they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to put money on these stories. The NGOs are willing to use photo reporters, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an opportunity for us to keep working on the stories we care about.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn addition to Ms Dorigny\u00e2\u0080\u0099s photo essay, Visa Pour l\u00e2\u0080\u0099Image is displaying at least one other exhibit funded by a nongovernmental organization: Doctors Without Borders, also known as M\u00c3\u00a9decins Sans Fronti\u00c3\u00a8res, paid for Dominic Nahr\u00e2\u0080\u0099s striking photos from South Sudan.Only a handful of magazines or newspapers worldwide still send photographers for international and long-term assignments, said Jean-Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Leroy, director of the festival. He acknowledged that, at times, the relationships between photographers and NGOs could lead to work that is \u00e2\u0080\u009cmore advertising or advocacy than journalism, \u201d but he said he showed work only from photographers with long journalistic track records.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m only exhibiting photographers that I know well and can trust,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Leroy said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know that when Dominic Nahr is working for M.S.F. or Marie is working for the European Union Parliament they are journalists first, not commercial photographers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The European Parliament was a sponsor of the festival last year but is not this year, Mr. Leroy added. However, he did suggest several names of experienced female photojournalists to the European Parliament\u00e2\u0080\u0099s public relations department for the migrant project. Ms. Dorigny was chosen by the department in consultation with an outside advertising agency.\u201cWe do many programs and events around human rights and we thought that photojournalism is an effective way to communicate those issues,\u201d said Tanja Rudolf, a public relations officer for the European Parliament. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe want to support photojournalists not just because it\u2019s a good way to illustrate what we do but also because journalism and a free press is part of the values of the European Parliament and a cornerstone of democracy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGiven that photojournalism is a profession in trouble, we thought it would be nice to connect to it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.  While the subject matter was assigned, Ms. Dorigny said she had complete editorial control of the project. She decided what photographs to take, which photos would be chosen and how they were captioned. Ms. Dorigny said that whenever she works for a nongovernmental organization, she uses a \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery tight\u00e2\u0080\u009d contract to protect her copyright and assure that she is the only one deciding how she works in the field.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t agree, I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work for them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to work by their rules.\u00e2\u0080\u009dPhotographers also face ethical dilemmas while working on editorial assignments, Ms. Dorigny said, when editors control which photos are used and the context in which they are placed.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel like I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a less honest photojournalist because I work in partnership with NGOs or the U.N.,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith magazines, I often have people telling me what I should photograph and what I should not photograph.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On many occasions, Ms. Dorigny said, major international magazines have agreed to assign her to stories that she suggested only if she is able to get additional funding either through government tourist offices or press offices or even private travel companies. It is not clear to her that newspapers and magazines, particularly in Europe, are pristine ethically. Many have clear political viewpoints and are owned by industrialists who openly seek to protect their outside businesses, she added.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe photographers have to fight to preserve our ethical standards no matter who we are working for,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on our shoulders.\u00e2\u0080\u009d   Sean Elliot, the chairman of the ethics committee of the United States-based National Press Photographers Association, is sympathetic to photographers who think they must look outside media organizations to fund important stories. But \u00e2\u0080\u009cpublic relations photos\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, whether paid for by nongovernmental organizations, corporations or the White House, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccannot be presented as independent journalism.\u201d\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a line between what is journalism and what is public relations or advocacy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEthically we have to acknowledge it, say who funds us and who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in charge of making the decisions.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe that the struggle for independent journalism as a source for accurate, fair coverage of the world\u2019s events is important.\u00e2\u0080\u009d "}
{"Headline": "Facebook Helps Develop Software That Puts Students in Charge of Their Lesson Plans", "Date": "2016-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPriscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook, last month. They were the catalysts for Facebook\u2019s partnership to build classroom software with Summit Public Schools.Facebook is out to upend the traditional student-teacher relationship.Rather than have teachers hand out class assignments, the Facebook-Summit learning management system puts students in charge of selecting their projects and setting their pace. The idea is to encourage students to develop skills, like resourcefulness and time management, that might help them succeed in college.\u201cAs parents and kids and teachers get access to this type of learning, I think more and more will want it,\u201d Diane Tavenner, the co-founder and chief executive of Summit Public Schools, said in a telephone interview.But the Summit-Facebook system, called the \u201cSummit Personalized Learning Platform,\u201d is different.The software gives students a full view of their academic responsibilities for the year in each class and breaks them down into customizable lesson modules they can tackle at their own pace. A student working on a science assignment, for example, may choose to create a project using video, text or audio files. Students may also work asynchronously, tackling different sections of the year\u2019s work at the same time.The system inverts the traditional teacher-led classroom hierarchy, requiring schools to provide intensive one-on-one mentoring and coaching to help each student adapt.This summer, more than 1,500 educators and leaders of public, private and charter schools participating in the program, called Summit Basecamp, attended sessions to learn how to use the system. Among the 19 schools that introduced the new learning approach last year, at least a few educators and administrators reported a steep learning curve.\u201cThere were many points where we weren\u2019t sure the Summit Basecamp model was what our students needed,\u201d said Claire Fisher, the principal of Urban Promise Academy, a public middle school in Oakland, Calif., which introduced the platform in its sixth-grade classes.By the end of the school year, however, 31 percent of the school\u2019s sixth graders were reading at or above their grade level, compared with just 9 percent in the fall. That was a larger improvement in reading than students in seventh and eighth grades, which did not use the platform, Ms. Fisher said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Arianna Huffington Is Leaving Huffington Post", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySince it started 11 years ago, The Huffington Post has been synonymous with the personality and the interests of its co-founder, Arianna Huffington.The pioneering web publication, known for its aggressive use of aggregation and an unapologetically liberal worldview, would go on to win a Pulitzer Prize and expand globally during a challenging time for all media organizations.But over the last year, The Huffington Post has found itself an increasingly small part of an increasingly large media and tech conglomerate. When Verizon, which announced it had purchased The Huffington Post\u2019s parent company, AOL, in May 2015, bought Yahoo\u2019s internet business last month, Ms. Huffington\u2019s perch at the company seemed increasingly precarious.With her abrupt announcement on Thursday that she was stepping down as editor in chief of The Huffington Post and leaving the company to focus on her new venture, a health and wellness start-up called Thrive Global, she leaves the publication in an unfamiliar position. For the first time since its founding in 2005, The Huffington Post will be without Ms. Huffington. No successor was named.In an interview, Ms. Huffington, 66, said she had originally intended to run The Huffington Post while working to start Thrive Global. But that plan soon reached its limits.\u201cThe original idea was that I could do both,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it very quickly turned out to be an illusion.\u201dAlong with her success, Ms. Huffington has been a polarizing figure in the media world, and her presence in the newsroom has not always been constant. But since Verizon bought AOL, her interests seemed to increasingly move beyond running The Huffington Post. After the sale, there was speculation that she would leave the company, concerns allayed when she signed a four-year contract in June 2015.Other moves have generated misgivings in the newsroom. The publication\u2019s decision last summer to put articles about Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign in its entertainment section and a later decision to add an editor\u2019s note calling Mr. Trump a \u201cserial liar\u201d and a \u201cracist\u201d to any article about him raised questions about whether Ms. Huffington was unduly influencing coverage to suit her political agenda.In April, the announcement that she was joining Uber\u2019s board rankled employees who feared inherent conflicts of interest in coverage. (She said she would recuse herself from being involved with any coverage of the company.) The publication has also been criticized for what some see as excessive coverage of sleep and wellness, topics on which Ms. Huffington has written books.At the same time, staff attrition, evidenced by a flurry of goodbye emails over the last year, has taken a toll on morale. In that context, Ms. Huffington\u2019s decision to leave surprised an already anxious newsroom.At a staff meeting Thursday morning in The Huffington Post\u2019s Manhattan headquarters, Ms. Huffington stressed her confidence in the organization. \u201cGreat companies always succeed beyond their founder,\u201d she said, according to an article by Michael Calderone, the publication\u2019s media reporter. \u201cEven though HuffPost bears my name, it is absolutely about all of you and about this amazing team we\u2019ve been for over 11 years.\u201dTim Armstrong, the chief executive of AOL, was not present. But in a statement, he called Ms. Huffington a \u201cvisionary who built The Huffington Post into a truly transformative news platform.\u201d\u201cToday, The Huffington Post is a firmly established and celebrated news source, and AOL and Verizon are committed to continuing its growth and the groundbreaking work Arianna pioneered,\u201d he added.When The Huffington Post was founded, there was no Twitter, and Facebook was still a relatively fledgling online platform primarily used by college students. Initially, the idea was to create an aggregation site that would be a liberal counterpart to the Drudge Report. Ms. Huffington, who had recently run for governor of California, said at the time that she had signed up more than 250 of \u201cthe most creative minds\u201d in the country, including Walter Cronkite, Nora Ephron and Norman Mailer, to write a group blog on topics including politics and entertainment.The Huffington Post did not just take the internet seriously; it ruthlessly embraced as opportunities trends that established media companies perceived as threats. The company demonstrated early and continued mastery over Google, capturing audiences through search with carefully engineered headlines and fast aggregation. The publication consistently outranked its competitors in search, often with blog posts based on its competitors\u2019 work. But while the strategy proved successful, the site\u2019s ability to package articles from other publications also prompted criticism, and many in the media world accused it of aggregation excesses that bordered on intellectual theft.Over the years, however, it has pushed aggressively to produce more original content. The site also published articles by non-journalists, who often contributed without being paid.AOL purchased the publication for $315 million in 2011 and Ms. Huffington assumed control of AOL\u2019s editorial content. The Huffington Post won a Pulitzer Prize in 2012 for a series on wounded veterans.Ms. Huffington\u2019s relationship with Mr. Armstrong was rocky almost from the start, several current and former employees said, and some said her outside interests kept her out of the newsroom for extended periods.When AOL sold itself to Verizon for $4.4 billion, there was speculation that Ms. Huffington might leave. She had become an increasingly powerful force in her own right: She has published several books on health and wellness, including \u201cThrive\u201d and \u201cThe Sleep Revolution,\u201d and she has become a champion of the benefits of a good night\u2019s sleep.Though Ms. Huffington\u2019s departure came as a shock, it was in some ways inevitable, particularly after she announced the formation of Thrive Global in June.In the interview, Ms. Huffington said she had thought about leaving The Huffington Post for \u201ca while,\u201d and the closing of a funding round for Thrive Global last week ultimately drove her move. \u201cIt was my decision\u201d to leave, she said, adding that the contract she signed last year had a carve-out clause that allowed her to start a new venture.Ms. Huffington said she would stay on at the publication until early September.\u201cI\u2019m going to be very much around for the rest of the month, helping in every way I can, including having Greek sweets in my office,\u201d she said, a nod to her home country and her distinctive accent.Mr. Armstrong said in a note to staff that the company had formed an interim editorial committee that would act in Ms. Huffington\u2019s place. The committee will also be involved in what Mr. Armstrong described as \u201can ongoing search\u201d for a new editor in chief.In a separate note to employees, Jared Grusd, the chief executive of The Huffington Post, called Thursday a \u201cday of change.\u201d\u201cToday,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis the first day of the next chapter in HuffPost\u2019s history.\u201dJohn Herrman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Get the Most out of Visiting World-Famous Sites", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "Supported byThe GetawayIf you\u2019re visiting Florence, Italy, you\u2019ve got to see the world-famous Uffizi Gallery. But why? Because that\u2019s what one does in Florence? Because you feel compelled to post a selfie in front of Botticelli\u2019s \u201cBirth of Venus\u201d?Those are obviously terrible reasons. We shouldn\u2019t go to places because they\u2019re world-famous; we should go to fully appreciate the thing that made them world-famous \u2014 an unparalleled collection of Renaissance art, for example. But that requires a thoughtful, well-planned visit, not just following the masses, snapping pictures and checking it off your bucket list.I spoke with those in charge of some of the world\u2019s great attractions to glean strategies for making the most of a visit, both substantive improvements and simple beat-the-crowds techniques. Because, no matter how great the view is from the crown of Lady Liberty, you don\u2019t want to wait in a long line to get there.The ultimate way to avoid crowds is to visit during the off-season; in other words, not now. Many dismiss off-season travel as unviable because of school schedules, but remember American Thanksgiving and spring breaks (if they don\u2019t fall over Easter week) don\u2019t mirror other countries\u2019 vacations.Timed tickets can often be bought days in advance and are increasingly available at crowded attractions around the world. At the Uffizi, they cost 4 euros extra (boosting admission to 16.50 euros, about $18) and take care of waiting in line, if not the crowds.You can buy them at the official Uffizi website, uffizi.it, if you can find it. Unofficial sites that look official are rampant. They often look good and sometimes contain good information, but look out. \u201cYou can pay $30 or $40 on a fake website,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said. \u201cAnd sometimes the tickets do not exist\u201d \u2014 that is, they\u2019re fakes. Even when they\u2019re just reselling real tickets, look out for markups. For example, uffizi.com, one of the unofficial sites, charges 24.99 euros (about $27.35), and it even marks up the audio guides.Another reason to set aside more time: Visitors skip the less-famous but equally worthwhile, often beautifully complementary sites nearby.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article referred incorrectly to the availability of tickets for the Statue of Liberty. As the article correctly notes, tickets to visit the crown \u2014 not the entire monument \u2014 are sold out until early November.An article last Sunday about visiting tourist-heavy sites misstated the surname of the lead park ranger for the Statue of Liberty National Monument. As the article correctly noted elsewhere, he is Michael Amato, not Damato.Advertisement"}

But in Israeli eyes, Palestinian leaders starting with Yasir Arafat, the father of Palestinian nationalism who helped found Fatah in 1959, have had a habit of saying one thing in Arabic and another in English.Mr. Abbas, who succeeded Mr. Arafat, has repeatedly said he supports nonviolent resistance against the Israeli occupation. But Fatah has historically championed armed resistance as a central tenet of its doctrine for the liberation of the Palestinian people.Fatah is now a large and unwieldy movement, and its activists often make statements that do not reflect Mr. Abbas\u2019s position.\u201cPresident Abbas\u2019s party boasts about committing mass murder and yet it is called \u2018moderate\u2019 by many,\u201d said David Keyes, a spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. \u201cImagine if Palestinian leaders spent their time praising coexistence instead of terror.\u201dHusam Zomlot, the strategic affairs adviser to Mr. Abbas, first questioned whether the Facebook page was official, and then said it was probably the work of some \u201chot-blooded youths.\u201dMr. Zomlot said that Israeli officials frequently wrote incendiary Facebook posts, and that Fatah\u2019s concerns were elsewhere.\u201cI\u2019m from Fatah and one of its leaders,\u201d he said. \u201cWe present a complete political platform, and the most important thing is to end the Israeli occupation.\u201dThe comments on the official Fatah Facebook page came in the context of coming local and municipal elections that are expected to be held on Oct. 8.The prospect of the elections is already whipping up strong emotions. They will be the first to be held in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in a decade since Fatah, the mainstream, secularist party that has long dominated the Palestine Liberation Organization, suffered an embarrassing defeat at the hands of Hamas, the Islamist militant group, in legislative elections in 2006.A year later Hamas seized control of the Gaza Strip, routing Fatah\u2019s forces there and confining Mr. Abbas\u2019s influence \u2014 and that of his Western-backed Palestinian Authority, which is largely staffed by Fatah loyalists \u2014 to parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.The West Bank and Gaza have since been divided by a bitter schism. Hamas, considered a terrorist organization by Israel, the United States and the European Union, refuses to recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist and has battled Israel several times in recent years.The coming elections are seen as an important barometer of public sentiment in both the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Fatah activists appear particularly nervous about the elections, because Hamas is widely seen by Palestinians as the less corrupt and more efficient party.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Poker Game, a Missing Gun and a Mayor Divide Stockton, California", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst, the residents of Stockton, Calif., learned that their mayor was the owner of a stolen gun linked to a homicide. Days later, he was arrested at a camp he runs for disadvantaged youths, accused of secretly recording teenagers playing strip poker, providing alcohol to minors and endangering children there a year earlier.Those were the latest in a string of episodes that have placed Stockton\u2019s mayor, Anthony Silva, under intense scrutiny, upending a Northern California community of nearly 300,000 people that is already struggling to repair wounds inflicted by violent crime and the 2008 foreclosure crisis.On Tuesday night, a packed City Council meeting began with cheers for the mayor, and included more than a dozen speakers who came to his defense.Days before the mayor\u2019s Aug. 4 arrest at the camp, a document released by the district attorney\u2019s office in San Joaquin County showed that a gun registered to Mr. Silva \u2014 one he had reported stolen \u2014 had been linked to a 2015 homicide: the death of a 13-year-old boy, Rayshawn Harris.Nearly a month after the boy was fatally shot, Mr. Silva reported the gun had been stolen from a home he owned, according to the Stockton Police Department. Mr. Silva, 41, was not accused of criminal wrongdoing in the gun case. But the boy\u2019s father, Willis Harris, questioned why the mayor had waited several weeks to make a report. \u201cI\u2019m just really tore up right now,\u201d said Mr. Harris, 60, in an interview. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he report it? My child could still be here.\u201dAt a news conference on Aug. 5, after his release on $20,000 bail, the mayor proclaimed his innocence of the camp-related charges.\u201cOne, everyone there was 18 years old,\u201d Mr. Silva said. \u201cNo. 2, I have never ever, ever, ever endangered a child. Ever.\u201dBut that assertion did not satisfy some of the mayor\u2019s critics. \u201cWhat is the mayor doing playing strip poker with 18-year-olds?\u201d said Michael Blower, 48, a City Council member and lifelong resident of Stockton. \u201cWhether or not he\u2019s guilty of all the crimes he\u2019s charged with, he\u2019s certainly guilty of poor judgment. And I just want my city to be able to heal, move on from this.\u201dIn an interview, a lawyer for Mr. Silva, Mark Reichel said that his client would ultimately be cleared of the charges. \u201cThey forced these kids to say this stuff,\u201d Mr. Reichel said, accusing local and federal investigators of pressuring minors into saying they were naked and drinking as Mr. Silva recorded. \u201cThey are drunk with power.\u201dMr. Silva was elected in 2012, calling himself the \u201cpeople\u2019s mayor\u201d and pledging to restore the city\u2019s reputation. A former chairman of the school board in Stockton, he also led the local Boys & Girls Club and has been active in a nonprofit organization called the Stockton Kids Club.Mr. Silva has run a sleep-away camp for a number of years, inviting at-risk youths for a week of bonfires and water sports. Campers, ages 7 to 17, sleep in cabins and can participate in a talent show. Parents pay on a sliding scale, with support from the Stockton Kids Club.Mr. Silva is running for re-election in Stockton against Michael Tubbs, 26, a City Council member who, in 2014, pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of driving under the influence. Mr. Tubbs did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Silva\u2019s lawyer said the mayor had waited to report the absence of the pistol and another gun because he was unsure whether the firearms had been stolen or misplaced.Others, however, say they have lost faith in the man they elected to lead them.\u201cWe already have a pretty tainted view of our city,\u201d said Andie Garvin, 35, a Stockton resident who once campaigned for Mr. Silva but now wants him out. \u201cIt seems like we\u2019re making strides, and then something like this comes out and it just knocks us 10 steps back.\u201dSusan C.

{"Headline": "Do-It-Yourself Fashion Thrives at the McCall Pattern Company", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe internet did little to disrupt it. Globalization could not shut it down. But while the McCall Pattern Company, the home-sewing brand founded in 1863, may seem like a business that time forgot, it finds itself newly fashionable.The company\u2019s headquarters have the look of a corporate environment in the days before digital culture banished clutter. There on the 34th floor of the Equitable Building, a 1915 skyscraper in Manhattan\u2019s financial district, you will find rooms filled with buttons and zippers, bolts of fabric on work tables and metal file drawers stuffed with paper pattern packets.There is a patternmaking room, where muslin is fitted to dress forms; a dressmaking room, where women at sewing machines make sample garments; and a photo studio, where models pose for simple shoots that emphasize the clothes, rather than sex or sizzle.For the 80 or so employees, home sewing is not so much a retro thing as it is a timeless pursuit.\u201cI\u2019ve done this long enough to know that people have it in their hearts,\u201d said Carolyne Cafaro, the creative director. \u201cThere could be one pattern company left in the world, but I do think people will always sew.\u201dMs. Cafaro\u2019s brief is to oversee the creation of some 700 patterns each year for the four lines that fall under the McCall Pattern Company banner. Each of the lines \u2014 McCall\u2019s, Butterick, Kwik Sew and Vogue Patterns (its name licensed from Cond\u00e9 Nast) \u2014 has its own catalog, which sewing enthusiasts find at fabric shops.Meg McDonald, who two years ago became the company\u2019s first social media manager, said she was troubled recently when she came across a photo of one of McCall\u2019s distinctively illustrated envelopes in a nostalgic \u201cDo You Remember?\u201d post on Facebook. There it was, a representation of the company she works for, alongside rotary phones and carousel slide projectors taken from the collective cultural attic.\u201cSo here\u2019s a perfect example of the \u2018Huh, you guys are still in business?\u2019 thing that happens to us all the time,\u201d Ms. McDonald wrote in an email.But if there is a sense in the broader culture that the McCall Pattern Company belongs to the Betty Draper past, the opposite view is held among 21st-century sewers. The patterns created here are blueprints, essential enablers for do-it-yourself-minded women and men who want to look stylish without plunking down thousands at a department store or the latest pop-up shop.9 PhotosA new appreciation for artisanal crafts has led the Etsy generation to embrace sewing. Once done mainly out of economic necessity, making clothes at home is back in fashion, relatively speaking.Lately, McCall has been mining its past to build a bridge to the future, posting images from its impressive archive to social media sites like Instagram and Pinterest. One of the publications showing its wares, Vogue Patterns, is a fashion treasure trove, and looking through old issues underscores the historical ties between the pattern companies, high fashion and Hollywood.Famous faces jump out on almost every page. There\u2019s Iman and Christie Brinkley modeling sportswear at the dawn of their careers in October 1977. There\u2019s Alexander Liberman, the legendary Cond\u00e9 Nast art director, on the masthead in an issue in 1958. And isn\u2019t that a baby-faced Marc Jacobs posed beside a girl wearing the striped jacket and pants he designed for Perry Ellis in 1990?Vogue Patterns was always the high-fashion bible for the advanced sewer, and the work from the star designers that appeared in its pages, including Givenchy, Christian Dior and Valentino, dispelled the notion that homemade clothing was frumpy or for the members of religious cults.For those who love the substance of fashion more than the hoopla that surrounds it, working for Vogue Patterns was \u2014 and is \u2014 the ultimate.\u201cThis is going to sound corny, but Vogue Patterns was my dream job,\u201d Ms. Cafaro said. \u201cMy mother and grandmother sewed and taught me to sew when I was young. I really loved it.\u201d16 PhotosBut the energetic Ms. Cafaro may be better suited to the more wide-ranging job of creative director. \u201cI have the attention span of a gnat,\u201d she said.She started in the industry in the late 1970s, selling Vogue Patterns in Bloomingdale\u2019s, and she remembers with fondness the luxe days, when she and her colleagues traveled to Europe to meet with designers. \u201cWe would take 10- to 12-day trips to Paris, London, Milan,\u201d she said. \u201cLife was good.\u201dPart of the goal of posting the archive images, said Ms. McDonald, is to spark curiosity among young people, many of whom were not taught sewing in school. To liven up its product, McCall has struck deals with popular sewing bloggers and turned them into designers.Ms. Hirsch, who blogs under the name Gertie and dresses in a retro rockabilly way, has appeared on the cover of the Butterick catalog and releases \u201cPatterns by Gertie.\u201dAnother blogger turned designer, who works for the McCall\u2019s line, is Nikki Brooks-Revis, 36. She began sewing only four years ago, she said, after amending her long-held view: \u201cMy thought was old people sew.

{"Headline": "Black Health Matters", "Date": "2016-08-27", "News": "Supported byFirst PersonThe first bloom appeared in the crease of my right elbow, an itchy cluster that I ignored. It was well into summer, so I wrote it off as heat rash, or something similarly seasonal.But then it started to spread. The topography of my body transformed into a foreign mess of hives and scaly patches.I had just come back from Puerto Rico, but my doctor ruled out Zika. Dermatologists were baffled. Allergy panels came back negative. Relief was fleeting: My skin would heal for a few days, only to burst back into a weeping rash.I spent the first few weeks of summer on my couch, comatose under the influence of prescription-strength antihistamines. Not long after, an extended heavy menstrual cycle left me feeling so ill and lightheaded that I almost fainted at work, alarming my co-worker Sue so much that she escorted me to an emergency room.Again, doctors found nothing they could pinpoint as the culprit. My acupuncturist was the first to suggest a potential trigger: Could my rash be stress-induced, he asked kindly, as he slid needles into my face and arms.All the rage and mourning and angst works to exhaust you; it eats you alive with its relentlessness. These slayings obey no humane logic. They force you to reconcile your own helplessness in the face of such brutal injustice, and the terrifying reality that it could happen to you, or someone you hold dear.These included acupuncture, herbal remedies, group meditation and dance classes, and the ones I attended felt lifesaving. I contacted Ms. Leigh to find out more about her programming. She said the need to care for the black body felt like \u201can emergency.\u201dMs. Leigh cites, as inspiration, the community health efforts of the Black Panther Party and a network of black female nurses who have been working since the days of the Underground Railroad.Ms. Leigh\u2019s work is carried out in the black radical tradition, one that declares that holistic health care is not a luxury, but rather an act of resilience, survival and disobedience \u2014 a necessity. \u201cIf you can\u2019t be a human being in public, you take it to a private place,\u201d she said.Making space to deal with the psychological toll of racism is absolutely necessary. In the aftermath of the deaths of Ms. Gaines, Mr. Sterling and Mr. Castile, I found myself sick with grief and astonished at how little it seemed to affect my white peers and colleagues.\u201cWe don\u2019t even have the empathy for ourselves,\u201d Ms. Leigh said mournfully.It\u2019s becoming much more common to see yoga studios offer classes aimed exclusively at people of color who are searching for ways to cope with racism and fears around police brutality.The class I attended was overflowing with black and brown bodies of all types, and began with a small ceremony to acknowledge those whose lives were lost. That recognition nearly brought me to tears. And the relief came from the affirmation that I wasn\u2019t the only person suffering. The room was at capacity.\u201cI was having a traumatic response, and I couldn\u2019t force anything,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really drove home the need for this space. Inside of the trauma, there\u2019s a desire for connection.\u201dA few days later, Dara Cole, the owner of Sacred, sent a note to her teachers, asking if anyone was willing to participate in a week of healing sessions. \u201cThe response was overwhelming,\u201d Ms. Benson said. \u201cEvery idea made it a class in that series.\u201dMs. Benson pointed out that Ms. Cole is a white woman, and that she led by example of how white people can support black people by \u201clistening when we\u2019re speaking about our experiences.\u201dMs. Leigh\u2019s residency ends in September, and Sacred\u2019s programming wrapped up in August. Both women said they felt the need for more, the demand is just that high.The cause of my rash is still a mystery. But I\u2019m thankful that it\u2019s dormant for now, and balance has largely been restored, however temporarily. My wellness strategy now includes more yoga and acupuncture, to fully embody the urgency that Ms. Leigh felt when she told me, \u201cWe need to step up the care to match the stress.\u201dJenna Wortham is a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Do-It-Yourself Fashion Thrives at the McCall Pattern Company", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "Supported byThe internet did little to disrupt it. Globalization could not shut it down. But while the McCall Pattern Company, the home-sewing brand founded in 1863, may seem like a business that time forgot, it finds itself newly fashionable.The company\u2019s headquarters have the look of a corporate environment in the days before digital culture banished clutter. There on the 34th floor of the Equitable Building, a 1915 skyscraper in Manhattan\u2019s financial district, you will find rooms filled with buttons and zippers, bolts of fabric on work tables and metal file drawers stuffed with paper pattern packets.There is a patternmaking room, where muslin is fitted to dress forms; a dressmaking room, where women at sewing machines make sample garments; and a photo studio, where models pose for simple shoots that emphasize the clothes, rather than sex or sizzle.For the 80 or so employees, home sewing is not so much a retro thing as it is a timeless pursuit.\u201cI\u2019ve done this long enough to know that people have it in their hearts,\u201d said Carolyne Cafaro, the creative director. \u201cThere could be one pattern company left in the world, but I do think people will always sew.\u201dMs. Cafaro\u2019s brief is to oversee the creation of some 700 patterns each year for the four lines that fall under the McCall Pattern Company banner. Each of the lines \u2014 McCall\u2019s, Butterick, Kwik Sew and Vogue Patterns (its name licensed from Cond\u00e9 Nast) \u2014 has its own catalog, which sewing enthusiasts find at fabric shops.Meg McDonald, who two years ago became the company\u2019s first social media manager, said she was troubled recently when she came across a photo of one of McCall\u2019s distinctively illustrated envelopes in a nostalgic \u201cDo You Remember?\u201d post on Facebook. There it was, a representation of the company she works for, alongside rotary phones and carousel slide projectors taken from the collective cultural attic.\u201cSo here\u2019s a perfect example of the \u2018Huh, you guys are still in business?\u2019 thing that happens to us all the time,\u201d Ms. McDonald wrote in an email.But if there is a sense in the broader culture that the McCall Pattern Company belongs to the Betty Draper past, the opposite view is held among 21st-century sewers. The patterns created here are blueprints, essential enablers for do-it-yourself-minded women and men who want to look stylish without plunking down thousands at a department store or the latest pop-up shop.9 PhotosA new appreciation for artisanal crafts has led the Etsy generation to embrace sewing. Once done mainly out of economic necessity, making clothes at home is back in fashion, relatively speaking.Lately, McCall has been mining its past to build a bridge to the future, posting images from its impressive archive to social media sites like Instagram and Pinterest. One of the publications showing its wares, Vogue Patterns, is a fashion treasure trove, and looking through old issues underscores the historical ties between the pattern companies, high fashion and Hollywood.Famous faces jump out on almost every page. There\u2019s Iman and Christie Brinkley modeling sportswear at the dawn of their careers in October 1977. There\u2019s Alexander Liberman, the legendary Cond\u00e9 Nast art director, on the masthead in an issue in 1958. And isn\u2019t that a baby-faced Marc Jacobs posed beside a girl wearing the striped jacket and pants he designed for Perry Ellis in 1990?Vogue Patterns was always the high-fashion bible for the advanced sewer, and the work from the star designers that appeared in its pages, including Givenchy, Christian Dior and Valentino, dispelled the notion that homemade clothing was frumpy or for the members of religious cults.For those who love the substance of fashion more than the hoopla that surrounds it, working for Vogue Patterns was \u2014 and is \u2014 the ultimate.\u201cThis is going to sound corny, but Vogue Patterns was my dream job,\u201d Ms. Cafaro said. \u201cMy mother and grandmother sewed and taught me to sew when I was young. I really loved it.\u201d16 PhotosBut the energetic Ms. Cafaro may be better suited to the more wide-ranging job of creative director. \u201cI have the attention span of a gnat,\u201d she said.She started in the industry in the late 1970s, selling Vogue Patterns in Bloomingdale\u2019s, and she remembers with fondness the luxe days, when she and her colleagues traveled to Europe to meet with designers. \u201cWe would take 10- to 12-day trips to Paris, London, Milan,\u201d she said. \u201cLife was good.\u201dPart of the goal of posting the archive images, said Ms. McDonald, is to spark curiosity among young people, many of whom were not taught sewing in school. To liven up its product, McCall has struck deals with popular sewing bloggers and turned them into designers.Ms. Hirsch, who blogs under the name Gertie and dresses in a retro rockabilly way, has appeared on the cover of the Butterick catalog and releases \u201cPatterns by Gertie.\u201dAnother blogger turned designer, who works for the McCall\u2019s line, is Nikki Brooks-Revis, 36. She began sewing only four years ago, she said, after amending her long-held view: \u201cMy thought was old people sew.

{"Headline": "After Ailes and Cosby, a Moment for More Women to Speak Up", "Date": "2016-08-07", "News": "Supported byIn the fall of 1991, an obscure law professor named Anita Hill pushed the issue of sexual harassment into the public consciousness when she accused her former boss, the Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, of having repeatedly made lewd overtures toward her.But the episode sent a mixed message, in the view of many discrimination experts. While it raised awareness about a corrosive workplace behavior, the intense backlash against Ms. Hill, not least from members of the United States Senate, suggested that women faced great obstacles in redressing such abuses. (Mr. Thomas denied the allegations.)Nearly 25 years later, after a string of sexual harassment allegations that led to the ouster of Roger Ailes, the former chairman of Fox News, and a cascade of sexual assault accusations against the comedian Bill Cosby, some of those experts believe we may be approaching another Anita Hill moment.The Ailes and Cosby cases, they say, could be influential among women across the work force not just because of the intrinsic power of these examples, but because they come at a moment of empowerment for women in their struggle for equality. And when women\u2019s assertiveness produces dramatic results like the resignation of Mr. Ailes, it can inspire more women to follow the same path.\u201cWhen Anita Hill came out against Clarence Thomas, she got nothing and Clarence Thomas got life tenure,\u201d said Linda Hirshman, a Supreme Court biographer and former women\u2019s studies professor. \u201cIf anything would make the idea of women coming forward into a real threat, it would be the wicked confluence of everybody\u2019s dad, Bill Cosby, and Roger Ailes, the scariest man in the world \u2014 the fact that those two are going down.\u201dStill, workplace advocates caution that a greater sense of power, and even high-profile legal victories, will not necessarily lead to a significant increase in the number of women who take formal action. They note studies indicating that the great majority of sexual harassment incidents at work still go unreported.That sentiment was echoed by Carol Costello, a CNN anchor who, in a segment that aired last week, said that she had been sexually harassed when she was younger. Ms. Costello said she was inspired by the Ailes and Cosby cases to step forward, and thought it was important \u201cto add my voice to the cause,\u201d but was skeptical about whether it would lead to systemic change.\u201cI still think that there are consequences for women who come forward vocally or file lawsuits,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cA part of me still thinks that things haven\u2019t changed all that much.\u201dThe number of women filing sexual harassment charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission did increase significantly in the years after Ms. Hill came forward. But the impact of her testimony on that increase was somewhat muddied by a 1991 law that gave people alleging employment discrimination the right to a jury trial and allowed for additional monetary awards.Widely publicized cases appear to have played a role in prompting others to come forward in a variety of narrower contexts as well.A similar pattern appears to have played out in the banking industry. After the equal employment commission joined a prominent discrimination case against Morgan Stanley in 2001, the agency saw an uptick in sex discrimination charges from inside financial firms.The advertising industry has had its own increase in women speaking out. In March, the chief executive of the storied agency J. Walter Thompson resigned after a female employee filed a lawsuit accusing him of racist and sexist behavior. Within weeks, a number of top female executives had come forward to publicly describe their own experiences with sexism in the industry.The matter involving Gretchen Carlson, the former Fox anchor who filed a sexual harassment and retaliation lawsuit against Mr. Ailes last month, appears to be having a similar effect, beginning with at least two women who breached settlement agreements to describe their own experiences at the network.Kamee Verdrager, a lawyer, is pursuing her own yearslong legal battle over allegations of discrimination against a former employer, the law firm Mintz Levin, which stripped her of two years\u2019 seniority after she returned from maternity leave, and subsequently fired her. (Mintz Levin denies the allegations of discrimination but doesn\u2019t dispute these facts.) She said that prior examples of women speaking out could provide an enormous psychological boost for others contemplating their own action.In Ms. Verdrager\u2019s case, reading a book about women\u2019s struggles to succeed in the legal profession, which included numerous interviews with women who had faced discrimination, helped persuade her to file her complaint. \u201cThat book changed my life,\u201d she said. \u201cThe takeaway was that this is not unique to me. It\u2019s epidemic.\u201dBut the same connectedness that can provide support for victims can also work against them; some plaintiff\u2019s lawyers argue that the risks of speaking out have actually increased over time. Three decades ago, a court filing would have been extremely difficult for a prospective employer to uncover. Today, said Linda D. Friedman, a prominent employment lawyer who has brought many cases against Wall Street firms, the \u201ctroublemaker\u201d charge is likely to dog plaintiffs their entire lives.\u201cAny H.R. person in the country can do a Google search and come up with a federal complaint before deciding whether to hire a person,\u201d she said.To the extent that a high-profile case like Ms. Carlson\u2019s may encourage more survivors of harassment to come forward, many advocates say, it is more likely to happen indirectly, by first persuading employers to take discrimination and harassment claims more seriously. Only after most employees believe they can speak up without risking their careers, a development that many plaintiff\u2019s lawyers doubt is imminent, will they do so in substantially larger numbers.Still, if the fallout from the accusations against Mr. Cosby and Mr. Ailes is any indication, an increasing number of women may be concluding that speaking up is more likely than before to result in punishment for the alleged perpetrator rather than the accuser.Ms. Hill, now a professor at Brandeis University, is cautiously optimistic, though she worries that the $40 million payment Mr. Ailes reportedly received to leave Fox News could detract from the lesson of the case.\u201cThe fact the company is now not only talking to the women\u201d who have said they experienced harassment, \u201cbut also talking about whether others were enablers, that\u2019s important,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen who experienced harassment in their own workplace may see this as a possible outcome.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The Omran picture delivers a shock to the conscience but also strikes a balance between delivering a sharp message and being too difficult to view. It is compelling but not grisly; it can enter an Instagram feed or a Facebook wall, arouse sympathy, be shared and allow the viewer to move on without seeing the absolute worst of what war has to offer.Indelible images from the past \u2014 the flag-raising at Iwo Jima photographed by Joe Rosenthal, the execution of a Viet Cong taken by Eddie Adams, the myriad conflict images by photographers like James Nachtwey and Don McCullin \u2014 were published first in newspapers and magazines. Today, news organizations can be entirely bypassed; an image can slingshot around the world on social media without being published by a traditional media outlet. The democratization of information afforded by the internet can be wonderful, but also can be a double-edged sword. Images and words that have been crafted by responsible and careful journalists sometimes share a level playing field with ones that have not been vetted at all.In the end, though, shining a light on the world\u2019s most immiserated places \u2014 whether through traditional news organizations like The Times or through social media \u2014 is an important act. Many of us have become inured to the suffering in places like Aleppo. Sometimes it takes an image like this to rattle us awake.Follow Craig Allen on Twitter @Craig_D_Allen.Advertisement"}

As he said in his keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention in 2004, \u201cIn no other country on earth is my story even possible.\u201dThis was the moment Obama emerged onto the national stage: \u201cThere is not a black America and a white America and Latino America and Asian America \u2014 there\u2019s the United States of America.\u201d I can still feel the frisson his words stirred in Boston.Obama was at his most uplifting. Because he discovered America, pieced it together after his years overseas, saw it as a newcomer might, understood from experience the space it affords for personal reinvention, he brings a singular intellectual passion to the American idea: a nation of immigrants equal before the law dedicated to the proposition that among their inalienable rights are \u201clife, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\u201dHe admonished Donald Trump, the would-be savior: \u201cWe don\u2019t look to be ruled.\u201d No, Americans are engaged in \u201cself-government.\u201d He was reminding Americans, at a critical moment, of the first words of the Constitution: \u201cWe the People.\u201d Of every color, creed, sexuality, race, ethnicity are the people composed: That, for Obama, is America\u2019s strength; it\u2019s what gave him his.In no other nation is tomorrow so vivid, yesterday so pale. Where you came from yields to American rebirth. There is no real America to take back, as Trump insists, because America\u2019s many-hued reality is a ceaseless becoming. It is a mosaic in which a Barry Soetoro, his boyhood name in Indonesia, can become a Barry Obama and at last a proud Barack Hussein Obama \u2014 the country where, as Obama said in 2004, a \u201cskinny kid with a funny name\u201d finds his place.Yet this America, whose fault lines Obama the hybrid stepped across 12 years ago, is perhaps more divided than ever as his presidency winds down. There was something about Obama\u2019s blackness, his intellectualism, his cool distillation of problems that was intolerable to a wide swath of the white working class angered by lost jobs, lost wars, lost security and lost pride. These Americans have felt left behind. They have perceived not outreach from Obama\u2019s White House but condescension.I think a lot of this fracture was inevitable given the global economic context, and domestic political and cultural realities, within which Obama worked. Still, he could not bridge the divide; perhaps he sharpened it.Michelle also participated in Obama\u2019s 1996 conversation with Cook, part of which appeared in The New Yorker in 2009, and worried that her husband was \u201ctoo much of a good guy for the kind of brutality\u201d of politics. Obama talked about how Michelle was at once \u201ccompletely familiar\u201d and \u201ca complete mystery to me in some ways\u201d and how the tension between those two feelings \u201cmakes for something strong, because, even as you build a life of trust and comfort and mutual support, you retain some sense of surprise or wonder about the other person.\u201dAmerica has been governed, for almost eight years now, by a happy, grounded man who knows how to love a woman. That has not been the least of Obama\u2019s gifts to the nation he stitched together in his personal quest.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Daily Report: The Message From Snapchat", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsSnapchat is famous for its disappearing messages. Its financial success, however, may prove a very durable message.The mobile messaging company grew up in the wake of Google, which collected data based on internet search behavior to offer ads based on your queries. It came after Facebook, which collected data based on your social behavior to intuit interests and affect your buying behavior.This may be in the form of a geofilter, which enables a Snapchat user to pick up a \u201csticker\u201d from a certain location, or a lens, which is often something product-related that a person can incorporate into an image of themselves.Pok\u00e9mon Go is getting a lot of attention as the first mass use of augmented reality, but maybe that credit should go to Snapchat. People are combining their own faces with Taco Bell tacos or X-Men Wolverines, and then distributing these augmented objects to their friends. People are stumbling into locations and obtaining commercial images that say what they are consuming, so they can pass them around.Snapchat is not following you, at least not in this part of its business; it is counting on you to follow other things. And, at least when it comes to the taco transformation, it is counting on the bottomless modern desire to make things ironic \u2014 unless for so many there is beauty in seeming like a popular Mexican fast food.Considering that almost half of America\u2019s 18-to-34-year-olds open Snapchat every day, it\u2019s almost certainly the desire for the casually comical. That is the demographic advertisers crave, since consumption and brand loyalty are not yet fixed in the age group.When you think about it, this is a powerful development. Instead of Google- and Facebook-type offers for stuff people can accrue, Snapchat is offering ways we can pour ourselves into a product and share the personalized outcome with other consumers.Is there enough appetite for this kind of comic yet sincere interaction for Snapchat to earn its current valuation of $19 billion? Or do we burn out on it?That sounds a little like a \u201chow high is up?\u201d question. A casual look at our entertainment choices indicates that the appetite for celebrating ourselves and our products is unquenchable.All this, and the scale of Snapchat\u2019s ambitions, raises valid questions of what else it might need to figure out, in addition to selling (apparently for much less net revenue) the regular ads it offers on its space.Advertisement"}

After all, one\u2019s friends tend to share one\u2019s political biases. Facebook likes sharing because it builds loyalty to Facebook.Sharing, to Facebook, is a way that you build your personal brand, a statement of ego that is likely to keep you on the site longer. That is why Facebook\u2019s computers watch what you do on the site. It wants to know what kind of stories to put in front of you, so you will read and share them.On one hand, this is a nice service: You get the kind of news you seem to enjoy reading, which speaks to your worldview. On the other hand, this impedes encountering views unlike yours.Approaching difference with empathy is at the heart of democracy, so the more our own views are endorsed by algorithms, the worse off democracy is. Look no further than the incomprehension and contempt with which many on both sides view each other in the current election season.Of course, this existed long before Facebook. Talk radio and cable news enabled a range of viewpoints, and the biggest networks run programs that endorse a worldview of the right or the left. Direct marketing isolates us too, with lifestyle promises targeted to the people in our ZIP code.Online life took this to a whole new level, with Google-type ad targeting that is as personal as an individual\u2019s search and shopping choices.The latest advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence may compound the problem. These are statistical systems with narrow aims: If it turns out you like something, you\u2019ll get more of it, which you may like and share, ensuring you\u2019ll get more of it.Somebody could build a recommendation engine intended to foster a sympathetic view of others\u2019 lives and values.

One of them jumped on a body, joyfully.A set of images, also released online, showed two Russian drivers\u2019 licenses \u2014 one belonging to a young woman, another to a young man \u2014 and a laminated Orthodox icon of God. It was not possible to establish the names of the people pictured on the licenses.Dmitri S. Peskov, a spokesman for the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, confirmed that all those on board had been killed, according to the Tass state news agency, and he expressed condolences to the victims\u2019 families.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which opposes the Syrian government and tracks the conflict from Britain through contacts in Syria, said the helicopter had crashed near the village of Saraqib in Idlib Province.The aircraft had recently delivered aid to two Shiite villages nearby that have long been surrounded by Sunni rebels, the group said.None of Syria\u2019s many rebel groups immediately claimed responsibility for shooting down the helicopter. But at a news briefing on Monday, Lt. Gen. Sergei F. Rudskoi, a senior member of the Russian general staff, said it had been shot down over territory controlled by the Nusra Front and \u201cthe so-called moderate opposition.\u201d He called the attack a \u201cterrorist act.\u201dLast week, Russia said it had established several humanitarian passages in Aleppo to let civilians and insurgents leave the area. So far, 324 civilians and 82 militants have left the city through them, General Rudskoi said. (Opposition groups in Syria have disputed these claims.)Citing the need to fight terrorists in faraway territories before they arrived in Russia, Mr. Putin began a military operation in Syria at the end of September in support of the government of President Bashar al-Assad.He ordered a partial withdrawal of Russian forces from Syria in March, but military operations continued, although at a lower intensity.A number of similar episodes have occurred over the course of Russia\u2019s involvement in the Syrian war.That episode provoked a standoff between Russia and Turkey, which ended with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan apologizing to Mr. Putin in July.After the downing of the Mi-25 in July, Russia sent Tu-22M3 bombers to hit Islamic State targets in the Syrian areas of Palmyra, Es-Suhne and Arak.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misidentified the source of reports that the helicopter was brought down by ground fire. The source was the Russian Defense Ministry, not a video posted by antigovernment activists. The error was repeated in a capsule summary.Ben Hubbard and Hwaida Saad contributed reporting from Beirut, Lebanon, and Maher Samaan from Paris.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Snapchat Used to Spook Advertisers. Not Anymore.", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "Supported byYet by this June, when the conference was held again in Cannes, Snapchat had become one of the most buzzed-about marketing platforms. It is convincing companies that its ads \u2014 which let users adorn pictures and videos with all manner of images and branding \u2014 create a more interactive experience than Facebook and YouTube ads, which most users watch passively.\u201cAdvertisers want to be associated with the trendiest, newest thing, and this year, that\u2019s Snapchat,\u201d said Chad Stoller, executive vice president and global innovation director of IPG Mediabrands.How Snapchat got its ad business on track is a case study of a fast-growing start-up overcoming growing pains and persuading companies to try untested ways to reach consumers.When Snapchat opened itself up to advertisers more than a year ago, many initially griped that the company needed to lower its ad prices. Some were mystified about how to reach the right audience with the ads, since Snapchat did not provide traditional ad-targeting tools. Most of all, brands wondered how Snapchat could be effective when the ads \u2014 like Snapchat messages \u2014 disappeared.In the last 15 months, Snapchat has moved to respond. It introduced new ad formats. It dangled its attractive user base \u2014 the service now claims 150 million daily users, including nearly half the country\u2019s population from ages 18 to 34 \u2014 to lure advertisers. Most important, Snapchat has persuaded brands like Tiffany & Company, Kraft Foods and Burger King that its ads let them interact playfully with this young audience.When Snapchat entered the ad business, \u201cit didn\u2019t quite have the infrastructure, and the market didn\u2019t understand it,\u201d said Sarah Hofstetter, chief executive of the ad agency 360i. \u201cIt was a bumpy beginning.\u201dIn an interview, Imran Khan, Snapchat\u2019s chief strategy officer, said the company\u2019s ad formats gave brands \u201ca creative platform\u201d that made ads a \u201cnatural experience.\u201d Snapchat declined to comment on its revenue.\u201cAt that price, it was too hard to test the waters and learn in a new environment,\u201d said Ms. Hofstetter of 360i.Mr. Khan set about trying to respond to concerns while building out an ad team. He recently recruited Viacom\u2019s advertising sales chief, Jeff Lucas, to be his new vice president for ad sales. He opened new ad sales offices in cities such as London and Sydney, Australia, to provide more support to those making ads for Snapchat.Snapchat also began introducing less expensive ad products, some of which start at just $5. This summer, the company let third parties sell ad space on Snapchat, which makes it easier to get more ads onto the app.Mr. Khan\u2019s biggest job was to explain why Snapchat\u2019s unusual platform was better for advertisers. The task was thorny because Snapchat is a messaging, sharing and broadcast service where most content disappears. Companies had few comparable apps to judge Snapchat against.Brands that \u201chad become too focused on metrics\u201d suddenly saw in Snapchat a \u201cplayful way to deepen customer loyalty and affinity,\u201d said Constance DeCherney, director of strategy at the ad agency TDA Boulder.\u201cIt was all taco, taco, taco,\u201d said Ryan Rimsnider, senior manager of Taco Bell\u2019s social media team. \u201cIt was a little surreal.\u201dTaco Bell, a major advertiser, was an early supporter of using Snapchat as a branding tool. Snapchat executives recently attended Taco Bell\u2019s three-year \u201cSnapiversary,\u201d which included a custom geofilter for the event. Taco Bell later sent a taco truck to Snapchat\u2019s headquarters.Since those early ad experiments, other brands have started campaigns on the messaging service. Last week, Tiffany & Company began its first Snapchat campaign with a lens of the Tiffany logo and flying hearts in Tiffany blue that people could use to decorate their selfies and videos.Snapchat said millions of consumers in the United States, Australia and Italy played with the lens for about the same amount of time as it takes to watch a normal video ad. They then shared their pictures and videos, spreading Tiffany\u2019s brand. The lens is now gone, replaced by a geofilter that adds Tiffany-branded stickers to photos when you enter a Tiffany store.\u201cConsumers want something more than a passive experience,\u201d said Diana Hong-Elsey, Tiffany\u2019s vice president for global digital marketing. \u201cWhen you know content will disappear, you want to interact with it in that moment.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Champion of Human Rights in China Leaves a Tarnished Legacy", "Date": "2016-08-13", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Harry Wu, who spent 19 years in Chinese labor camps, was a familiar figure on Capitol Hill, delivering searing broadsides against China\u2019s authoritarian government that drew admiration from American politicians condemning the country\u2019s human rights abuses.His close relationship with lawmakers helped Mr. Wu secure a $17 million grant from Yahoo in 2007 to aid families of persecuted dissidents, when the tech giant was facing withering criticism for assisting the Chinese authorities in identifying activists who had used the company\u2019s email service.But by the time Mr. Wu, 79, died in April, his legacy had become tarnished. He provided just $1.2 million to dissidents\u2019 families, while spending more than $13 million of the Yahoo money to operate his own foundation, which runs a website and a small museum, according to financial disclosures, court documents and interviews with former employees, foundation board members and human rights advocates.\u201cAmerican politicians think of Harry Wu as a hero, but the truth is he is an immoral person who betrayed the very people he was supposed to be helping,\u201d said Wang Jing, 47, the wife of a dissident.In a letter released days after his death, seven prominent dissidents in China called on American officials to investigate what they described as spending irregularities by the organization, the Laogai Research Foundation, and announced plans to file a lawsuit seeking that the roughly $3 million that remained from Yahoo\u2019s original grant be given to another group. Human rights advocates have been especially critical of Yahoo, whose executives sat on the foundation board until earlier this year but largely stood by as Mr. Wu overrode objections that he was inappropriately using the fund to buy real estate, run his museum and defend himself against lawsuits, according to board members and former employees.Yahoo\u2019s largess was not entirely selfless, and was widely seen as an effort to soothe public anger after the company provided the Chinese authorities the identities of Yahoo subscribers in China who had used their email accounts to distribute writings or documents that had angered the government. At least four of those email users were later jailed.The controversy underscores recurring issues of corporate social responsibility and unintended consequences as Silicon Valley executives, eager to tap into China\u2019s vast market, seek to win favor with the country\u2019s authoritarian rulers. In 2014, the social network site LinkedIn agreed to censor its results in China, and last year IBM provoked concern in the White House after it began allowing Chinese officials to examine proprietary source codes for its products. Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook has courted Chinese leaders in hopes of gaining access to the country\u2019s 700 million internet users.Yahoo, which was bought by Verizon last month, declined to respond to questions about its role overseeing the grant to Mr. Wu\u2019s organization, saying only in a statement: \u201cWe remain an industry leader in our commitment to protect and promote freedom of expression and privacy online.\u201dIn an interview two weeks before his death, Mr. Wu brushed off allegations of financial impropriety and defended his decision to largely discontinue giving grants to Chinese dissidents and their families. He said that foundation employees, unable to obtain visas to enter China, found it hard to verify the financial information provided by aid applicants. But he made little effort to hide his disdain for Chinese human rights activists who sought grants, describing them as greedy, deceitful and ungrateful. \u201cSome of them lie to us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are frustrated by these Chinese victims.\u201dThe Yahoo Human Rights Fund was born from a remarkable act of public humiliation. In the fall of 2007, Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Jerry Yang, was summoned to Congress and, on live television, sharply criticized by members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. As relatives of two jailed Chinese dissidents sat behind him, lawmakers spent nearly three hours criticizing the company\u2019s decision to cooperate with Chinese security agents, and for lying about its conduct during an earlier congressional hearing. \u201cWhile technologically and financially you are giants, morally you are pygmies,\u201d said Representative Tom Lantos, Democrat of California, who was then chairman of the committee. Mr. Lantos, a Holocaust survivor who died in 2008, urged Yahoo to offer financial compensation to the two dissidents\u2019 families.Visibly shaken, Mr. Yang, the son of Taiwanese immigrants, bowed apologetically. He met with the relatives and offered each family $3.2 million to settle a lawsuit against the company, according to Morton Sklar, a lawyer who represented the families. Mr. Yang also pledged $17.3 million to help other victims of Chinese rights abuses, especially those persecuted for using the internet to criticize the government. To administer the fund, Mr. Yang turned to Mr. Wu, the bespectacled figure who had been serving as translator for the relatives.After arriving in the United States in 1985, Mr. Wu had become a politically connected figure whose suffering made him a forceful symbol of the Communist Party\u2019s war on free speech, religious liberty and individual rights. With his tales of torture and starvation during his nearly two decades of imprisonment, Mr. Wu was a riveting presence at congressional hearings. \u201cHarry Wu was Exhibit A for members of Congress trying to highlight China\u2019s bad behavior with respect to human rights,\u201d said Nicholas Bequelin, director of Asia programs at Amnesty International. \u201cHis story gelled with the American narrative of heroic dissidents who had stood up to the state.\u201dMr. Sklar said Yahoo had hoped its fund would help repair its public image, but also serve as a reservoir of money for settling future claims from other Chinese dissidents \u2014 an arrangement that critics said was legally and ethically questionable. \u201cThey saw the fund as their get-out-of-jail-free card,\u201d Mr. Sklar said. \u201cBut Harry Wu saw the money as his own personal fund, to benefit his own activities.\u201dMr. Wu\u2019s role as administrator of the money proved problematic. In 2011, Yu Ling, the wife of one of the jailed activists, filed a lawsuit claiming Mr. Wu had pressured her to turn over the $3.2 million settlement and then purchased a $1 million annuity in his name. Mr. Wu eventually returned the money but a litany of grant applicants would later cite other irregularities. Some say they never received the money he had promised; others recalled signing blank disbursement forms but receiving only partial payment. A review of the organization\u2019s financial disclosure forms reveals at least $190,000 that is unaccounted for.Over the years, other allegations raised questions about Mr. Wu\u2019s fitness to administer the Yahoo fund. They included charges of domestic abuse by his wife that resulted in two years of probation. Ms. Wang, the wife of the dissident Yang Hai, alleged that Mr. Wu sexually harassed three adolescent girls, including her 16-year-old daughter, in her care in the Washington area, and then cut off a monthly stipend after Ms. Wang accused him in a still-pending lawsuit of sexual assault.In interviews, more than a dozen employees and board members of Mr. Wu\u2019s foundation say he bullied critics and rode roughshod over objections that he was spending too much on his organization and too little on the victims. In some years, financial disclosure forms show that the foundation spent less than 2 percent of annual disbursements on direct assistance to Chinese dissidents or their families; in recent years, such grants all but dried up.Mr. Wu, the employees said, made all spending decisions. Grants ranged from several hundred dollars to $10,000 but most averaged about $3,000, according to disclosure forms. Liao Tienchi, who says she was fired after a decade of working as Mr. Wu\u2019s assistant because she questioned his spending, said Yahoo ignored letters and emails she sent expressing concern. \u201cHe will harm the organization and damage the image of Yahoo,\u201d she warned in one letter sent in 2010. \u201cScandals will be exposed and it would be a heavy blow to the human rights issue in China.\u201dJeff Fiedler, an influential union leader and a former foundation board member, said he relinquished his seat five years ago in frustration. \u201cHarry was uncooperative and saw the money as his alone,\u201d he said. \u201cHe became extremely unreasonable.\u201d Over the years, Mr. Fiedler and other board members say Yahoo, whose in-house counsel was required to sign all disbursement checks, tried to intervene but ultimately extricated the company from Mr. Wu\u2019s foundation. In 2015, the company dissolved the Yahoo Human Rights Fund; in January, the company\u2019s representative resigned from the foundation.Mr. Wu, who earned $130,000 a year as executive director of the organization, used $2.5 million of the Yahoo grant last year to purchase a townhouse for offices and the museum in Washington, which is devoted to Chinese labor camps. Documents show that he spent more than $800,000 on legal fees to defend himself against at least four lawsuits filed by grant applicants, aid recipients and former employees, all of which were later settled or dropped.The Internal Revenue Service last year fined his organization about $40,000 for financial irregularities but stopped short of seeking the revocation of its nonprofit status, according to Mr. Wu.Thousands of people in China have been persecuted for publicly expressing their political views, and the government has often punished their families by denying them jobs, barring their children from schools and pressuring landlords to evict them from their homes. Humanitarian China, a California-based organization that gives grants to impoverished dissidents and their families, gives money to about 100 recipients a year, a marked contrast to the roughly 130 people who received grants from Laogai over the past decade.\u201cWe scramble to raise a few thousand dollars each year,\u201d said Yaxue Cao, a board member of the organization. \u201cImagine what we could have done with $17 million.\u201dIn the final interview before his death, Mr. Wu expressed annoyance over allegations against him and defended his decision to spend the bulk of the Yahoo money on his unfinished museum, which documents the horrors of China\u2019s forced labor camps.\u201cI thought a museum was the best way to make that happen, so we collected so many documents and personal testimonies to tell the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anyone has a better solution, I would accept that.\u201d Then he leaned forward and lowered his booming voice. \u201cI am 79,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m almost at the end.\u201dEmily Feng contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stephen Harper, Former Prime Minister of Canada, Quits Politics", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the video, recorded in what appeared to be a boardroom with two Canadian flags behind him, Mr. Harper offers no indication of his plans after politics, though several Canadian news outlets reported that he intended to open a consulting business with some of his former political aides.In his brief farewell on Friday, Mr. Harper offered a modest list of achievements. He said that his government had introduced tax cuts, balanced its budget (though that was not the case for most of his tenure), \u201cgot tough on crime and put families first\u201d and \u201ctook principled decisions in a complex and dangerous world.\u201dHe particularly highlighted that Canada was less affected by the 2008 global recession than other nations were. Some economists and political analysts attribute that at least in part to the effect of regulations that Mr. Harper had intended to relax or eliminate.No one disputes Mr. Harper\u2019s success in reuniting what had become a fragmented conservative moment in Canada, which brought the country\u2019s center-right a long period in power.In 2003, as the leader of the Canadian Alliance, which began as a protest party in Western Canada, Mr. Harper helped engineer a merger with the venerable but much diminished Progressive Conservative Party, whose roots traced back to Sir John A. Macdonald, Canada\u2019s first prime minister.\u201cHe\u2019s gone, but the party will go on,\u201d Dimitry Anastakis, a historian at Trent University in Peterborough, Ontario, said of Mr. Harper. \u201cThat\u2019s a testament to his shrewdness.\u201dRaymond B. Blake, a historian at the University of Regina in Saskatchewan, said that the fairly limited list of achievements stems from Mr. Harper\u2019s belief in small government and his decisions to turn more power over to provincial governments.\u201cHis mantra was: We will leave money in the hands of people and leave them to decide how to spend it,\u201d Professor Blake said.Stephanie Bangarth, a political historian at the University of Western Ontario, said Mr. Harper \u201cwas successful in moving Canadians to thinking of themselves as taxpayers, and their relationship with government as transactional, although you can now see Trudeau trying to change that.\u201dWhile in office, Mr. Harper controversially rolled back the powers of several regulatory agencies, or replaced their leaders with people who shared his small-government philosophy. Some programs, like a registry for rifles and shotguns and mandatory census participation, were scrapped. Public servants were severely restricted in their freedom to speak publicly.That was particularly true of scientists working on the issue of climate change, who were generally barred from speaking to reporters and frequently were not allowed to address scientific meetings.Mr. Harper, who was fiercely partisan, consolidated power in the prime minister\u2019s office, and twice suspended Parliament to avoid votes that might have put his government out of power.He carried over that aggressive style to international relations. As an unabashed champion of Alberta\u2019s oil industry, Mr. Harper tried hard to persuade the Obama administration to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have carried production from the province\u2019s oil sands to the refineries on the gulf coast of the United States. But his repeated lectures to Americans only brought a rejection of the plan from President Obama.Mr. Harper avoided holding news conferences. When he did speak publicly, his presentations were often uninspired. But for much of his time in office, that didn\u2019t matter. A dull but apparently hardworking prime minister struck many voters as preferable to the leadership turmoil and the even less inspirational figures at the head of the Liberal opposition.During the election campaign last year against the charismatic, if unproven, Mr. Trudeau, Conservative television ads showed Mr. Harper working hard late at night, the last person in the office.But Professor Blake said that Mr. Harper\u2019s lack of charm ultimately overshadowed his policies.\u201cHe was cold and distant,\u201d Professor Blake said. \u201cHe never made Canadians feel good about their country.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated, at one point, the month that federal elections were held in 2015. As noted correctly elsewhere in the article, it was October, not November.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Daily Report: The Message From Snapchat", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "Supported byBitsSnapchat is famous for its disappearing messages. Its financial success, however, may prove a very durable message.The mobile messaging company grew up in the wake of Google, which collected data based on internet search behavior to offer ads based on your queries. It came after Facebook, which collected data based on your social behavior to intuit interests and affect your buying behavior.This may be in the form of a geofilter, which enables a Snapchat user to pick up a \u201csticker\u201d from a certain location, or a lens, which is often something product-related that a person can incorporate into an image of themselves.Pok\u00e9mon Go is getting a lot of attention as the first mass use of augmented reality, but maybe that credit should go to Snapchat. People are combining their own faces with Taco Bell tacos or X-Men Wolverines, and then distributing these augmented objects to their friends. People are stumbling into locations and obtaining commercial images that say what they are consuming, so they can pass them around.Snapchat is not following you, at least not in this part of its business; it is counting on you to follow other things. And, at least when it comes to the taco transformation, it is counting on the bottomless modern desire to make things ironic \u2014 unless for so many there is beauty in seeming like a popular Mexican fast food.Considering that almost half of America\u2019s 18-to-34-year-olds open Snapchat every day, it\u2019s almost certainly the desire for the casually comical. That is the demographic advertisers crave, since consumption and brand loyalty are not yet fixed in the age group.When you think about it, this is a powerful development. Instead of Google- and Facebook-type offers for stuff people can accrue, Snapchat is offering ways we can pour ourselves into a product and share the personalized outcome with other consumers.Is there enough appetite for this kind of comic yet sincere interaction for Snapchat to earn its current valuation of $19 billion? Or do we burn out on it?That sounds a little like a \u201chow high is up?\u201d question. A casual look at our entertainment choices indicates that the appetite for celebrating ourselves and our products is unquenchable.All this, and the scale of Snapchat\u2019s ambitions, raises valid questions of what else it might need to figure out, in addition to selling (apparently for much less net revenue) the regular ads it offers on its space.Advertisement"}

But their views on the food chain evolved and, in the end, karma knocked.The threats have subsided, and now there is little sign of distress at their restaurants in Southern California.Servers continue to take diners their entrees accompanied with an ever-changing daily question. They have asked, \u201cWhat is your gift to give?\u201d and, \u201cWhat brings you joy?\u201dThe implication is that the restaurant is a sliver of nirvana.

{"Headline": "On Argentina Plains, Hunters Feel Besieged by Critics \u2018Made of Asphalt\u2019", "Date": "2016-08-25", "News": "Supported byUtrac\u00e1n JournalUTRAC\u00c1N, Argentina \u2014 After days in the wilderness, the hunters drove up to the sports club in rusty pickup trucks with carcasses of wild boars splayed on their roofs. One by one, the dead boars were heaved onto a bloodied crane scale, then lined up on planks, their snouts wedged open.Boar hunting in the remote, semiarid county of Utrac\u00e1n has endured for generations. Older huntsmen reminisce about their first forays into the thorny scrubland by moonlight; boys imitate their fathers\u2019 strides across vast plains as they follow packs of brawny mastiffs.Yet threats to that tradition are emerging as animal rights activists, buoyed by their growing clout in recent years, say the time has come to put an end to the hunts.\u201cPeople used to look at us like heroes,\u201d said Daniel Briguez, a 43-year-old construction site manager, who had a hunting knife strapped to his waist. \u201cToday, we\u2019re a nuisance.\u201dThe hunters bristle at such comments, saying they are under attack from critics often cocooned in distant cities.After feasting on marinated wild viscacha, a large rodent, on a recent night, Mr. Alfonso sat by the hearth of a remote farmhouse in Utrac\u00e1n, where La Pampa\u2019s crop fields and pastures begin to give way to expanses of wild lands interspersed by humble towns. His companions had gone off looking for boar tracks.With the skull of a puma looking down from the fireplace beside him, Mr. Alfonso laid out his view of the world.\u201cLa Pampa was shaped by rural men \u2014 lumberjacks clearing tracks in the forest, cattle drovers and fencers,\u201d he said, holding a hunting knife whose handle was carved from deer antlers. \u201cIf you\u2019re from the city, you\u2019re made of asphalt, sidewalks and the internet.\u201dIn many ways, Mr. Briguez epitomizes the passion of the hunters. He escapes as often as he can from the provincial capital of Santa Rosa along undulating sand tracks to hunting grounds in his 1999 Ford pickup. He will hunt through the night, then drive back home for a snooze on the sofa before another day at the construction site.The hunters, who cure much of the boar meat to eat at home, also emphasize the service they provide to the province\u2019s farmers by protecting their corn crops from foraging boars.Numbers are vague, but one study from 2009 estimated there were about 2,700 boars in just one part of Argentina\u2019s central steppe.The farmers often hire the huntsmen to cull the boars. There is a similar dynamic at play in Texas and Florida, where boars are said to have been introduced by Spanish conquistadors.\u201cThey damage both biodiversity and the agricultural economy,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Fernanda Cuevas, a biologist who researches the ecology of wild boars in Argentina. \u201cThe only solution to truly dissuade them is to hunt.\u201dBut even as supporters of hunting advance ecological as well as cultural arguments, opponents point to a tug of narratives extending beyond provincial borders.The carcasses of wild boars at a hunting tournament in Santa Rosa, La Pampa Province, Argentina.\u201cAll they see is the act of killing,\u201d said Luciano Beloqui, 35, a bearded former village mayor who prefers hunting with a telescopic rifle from stakeouts among the barbed cha\u00f1ar and piquill\u00edn shrubs.Carrying his young son in his arms, Mr. Beloqui traced a progression in villages like his, Quehu\u00e9, where he said children who used to take aim at birds with slingshots today hunt boars. As a mayor, he sought to raise awareness of the rural heritage; now, he said, \u201cWe must redouble our efforts.\u201dNow, the boar hunters fear that increasingly strict regulations imperil their tradition.For instance, a 2012 norm outlaws boar hunting for half of the year. And a new, though not enforced, rule obliges hunters to map out their routes across the province, which is roughly the size of Iowa.\u201cIt\u2019s as if we could wake up tomorrow and it\u2019d be prohibited,\u201d said Juan Carlos Cabral, 56, the long scratches on his nose attesting to a lifetime tramping through the scrubland.Mr. Cabral was helping to haul boar carcasses off the trucks near the sports club and through a parting crowd, including many women and children. Later, as some 300 hunters enjoyed a lunch of barbecued ribs and listened to live folk music, the tusks of their prey were measured to determine the winner of the main prize.As \u00c1ngel Rafael Aino, 31, a member of the winning team, straddled a dead boar and with a proud smile repeated the stabbing motion with which he had punctured its heart, some wondered how long such rituals would last.Still, observers say, hunting is too profitable an industry for the provincial authorities to ban it outright, with game reserves attracting a steady flow of tourists paying to hunt boars and red deer. The provincial government\u2019s hunting office highlighted in an email the direct and indirect revenues from all types of hunting. \u201cWe would never seek prohibition,\u201d it said.Nevertheless, fears persist and rifts are deepening among the hunters.The hunters outside the sports club, who are opposed to reserves, said they hoped future generations of hunters would be allowed to roam the flatlands despite the onslaught from critics.\u201cSharing this with my boy is the greatest thing,\u201d said Mr. Briguez, standing next to his son, Franco, 17, an aspiring veterinarian, and his hounds on a windswept plain. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of life.\u201dAdvertisement"}

As he said in his keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention in 2004, \u201cIn no other country on earth is my story even possible.\u201dThis was the moment Obama emerged onto the national stage: \u201cThere is not a black America and a white America and Latino America and Asian America \u2014 there\u2019s the United States of America.\u201d I can still feel the frisson his words stirred in Boston.Obama was at his most uplifting. Because he discovered America, pieced it together after his years overseas, saw it as a newcomer might, understood from experience the space it affords for personal reinvention, he brings a singular intellectual passion to the American idea: a nation of immigrants equal before the law dedicated to the proposition that among their inalienable rights are \u201clife, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\u201dHe admonished Donald Trump, the would-be savior: \u201cWe don\u2019t look to be ruled.\u201d No, Americans are engaged in \u201cself-government.\u201d He was reminding Americans, at a critical moment, of the first words of the Constitution: \u201cWe the People.\u201d Of every color, creed, sexuality, race, ethnicity are the people composed: That, for Obama, is America\u2019s strength; it\u2019s what gave him his.In no other nation is tomorrow so vivid, yesterday so pale. Where you came from yields to American rebirth. There is no real America to take back, as Trump insists, because America\u2019s many-hued reality is a ceaseless becoming. It is a mosaic in which a Barry Soetoro, his boyhood name in Indonesia, can become a Barry Obama and at last a proud Barack Hussein Obama \u2014 the country where, as Obama said in 2004, a \u201cskinny kid with a funny name\u201d finds his place.Yet this America, whose fault lines Obama the hybrid stepped across 12 years ago, is perhaps more divided than ever as his presidency winds down. There was something about Obama\u2019s blackness, his intellectualism, his cool distillation of problems that was intolerable to a wide swath of the white working class angered by lost jobs, lost wars, lost security and lost pride. These Americans have felt left behind. They have perceived not outreach from Obama\u2019s White House but condescension.I think a lot of this fracture was inevitable given the global economic context, and domestic political and cultural realities, within which Obama worked. Still, he could not bridge the divide; perhaps he sharpened it.Michelle also participated in Obama\u2019s 1996 conversation with Cook, part of which appeared in The New Yorker in 2009, and worried that her husband was \u201ctoo much of a good guy for the kind of brutality\u201d of politics. Obama talked about how Michelle was at once \u201ccompletely familiar\u201d and \u201ca complete mystery to me in some ways\u201d and how the tension between those two feelings \u201cmakes for something strong, because, even as you build a life of trust and comfort and mutual support, you retain some sense of surprise or wonder about the other person.\u201dAmerica has been governed, for almost eight years now, by a happy, grounded man who knows how to love a woman. That has not been the least of Obama\u2019s gifts to the nation he stitched together in his personal quest.Advertisement"}

A soccer player who works out furiously and eats \u201ca lot,\u201d Ms. Suarez still found that 300 meals a semester (for $2,541) were too many.So she shared. One evening, Ms. Suarez swiped in four guests at Hayden, a dining hall famous for its homemade cookies. The hungry guests came via Share Meals, a campus website matching students needing food with those who have food. The 80-meal plan in Adam El-Sayigh\u2019s financial aid package had run out weeks before. He didn\u2019t have money for more. Happily, he hit the hot food stations first, filling a to-go container with two cheese sandwiches on toasted wheat and a tray with roast beef, chicken cacciatore and bow-tie pasta with vodka sauce. He then ordered a burger.Students have always offered one another casual swipes, and even sold them. (Advertised on Facebook: 50 swipes at Western Carolina University for $50; \u201cwilling to swipe in for $5\u201d at the University of California, Davis.) But frugality born of college debt and growing attention to food insecurity \u2014 a U.S.D.A. term for limited access to food \u2014 are spurring new thinking about how to spread the bounty. Activists in the food justice movement and college officials are creating tools and programs to help students donate meal swipes, while free food pantries are proliferating even on wealthy campuses.Some of the disparity is driven by dining policies. Many colleges require dorm residents to buy meal plans. But it\u2019s hard to predict at the start of the term what you\u2019ll use. Busy schedules and the desire to eat out mean missed dining hall meals. And the rules smart: Swipes may expire at the end of the term, or even each week. You might have to pull out cash for certain items, like a side of fries. But perhaps the biggest frustration is the wasted money that unused swipes represent.Anagha Uppal, an activist at the University of Tennessee, describes the meal plan rule as \u201can exercise in tyranny.\u201d Ms. Uppal has not used her plan \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t purchase from Aramark,\u201d she said between bites of chicken salad in pita (cost: $5.74) at the Golden Roast Coffeehouse.

It was Ms. Uppal who prodded officials to start the Big Orange Meal Share to let students donate swipes.Ms. Uppal sees student hunger, mandatory meal plans and higher prices as interconnected points in the food justice movement. Across the spectrum, dining hall spending is getting a hard look. Over the past decade, average board (20 meals a week) at four-year colleges has risen 46 percent, to $4,602 for 2014-15, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. To some, meal plans, at $7 to $13 a swipe, look like luxury spending that is driving up the cost of a degree.New Jersey legislators are proposing a bill to bar colleges from requiring students to buy meal plans. \u201cIf you thought about financing your food on a credit card or 8 percent loan, that is a significant cost,\u201d said Assemblywoman Nancy J. Pinkin, a bill sponsor.One reason for pricey meals is more and better choices, said Becky Schilling, editor in chief of Food Management, which covers the institutional dining industry. Students want global cuisine, breakfast at midnight and organic food from sustainable sources. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Where are you getting these products? How were these animals raised? Was it cage-free?\u2019\u2009\u201d Swipes may buy all-you-can-eat buffets, sandwiches and drinks at a food court, or \u201cmeal equivalency\u201d at a restaurant. \u201cDining dollars\u201d can work at Starbucks, campus stores, even food trucks. N.Y.U. has 11 meal plan options.At the same time, Ms. Schilling said, \u201cthis issue of hunger has percolated, and students are being vocal: \u2018We are paying a lot for the college experience and we are having trouble paying for this.\u2019\u201dThe scope of food insecurity is tricky to judge because research is scant, definitions are imprecise and campuses vary so much. A 2010 City University of New York survey found that 40 percent of students struggled to find food. On California State campuses, 24 percent faced food insecurity, according to a 2015 study, while just 13 percent went hungry at the University of California, San Francisco.Students on tight budgets are known to skip meals or reduce or quit dining plans to save money. Some on full financial aid get meals covered, then take smaller plans to pocket the difference in cash.One of the challenges is grasping the true contours of the problem. \u201cHow can we better understand which are the students who are making sacrifices versus the ones who are choosing ramen because they would rather save money for Thursday night?\u201d Ms. Sumekh asked.To prevent abuse, some campuses limit how many meals can be donated or claimed by the student body. At N.Y.U., Ann Marie Powell, director of Contract Dining Services, takes a more permissive stance and even lets Mr. Chin set up booths at dining halls. \u201cStudents\u2019 meal plans are theirs to use or share,\u201d she said. This fall, N.Y.U. will allow up to six emergency food vouchers a semester.Mr. Chin started Share Meals to tackle \u201chunger and loneliness.\u201d He encourages donors and recipients to sit down and talk. Ms. Suarez ate several times with a couple receiving her swipes, and she has ordered takeout so often for Mr. El-Sayigh that she has nicknamed him Curly Fries. \u201cHe messages me whenever,\u201d she said. She places the order; he picks it up.Alexa Osterhoudt, a biology major, is grateful for Share Meals. Since her mother lost her job, she moved off campus, eliminated her meal plan and doesn\u2019t buy textbooks or class supplies. Her food budget is $7.50 a week. She said she\u2019s \u201cmade friends with a lot of people who work at groceries and restaurants,\u201d spending time and emotional energy searching for food. One student started swiping her in every Thursday. Her dining hall preference? \u201cAnything with a buffet.\u201dLaura Pappano is writer-in-residence at Wellesley Centers for Women.Advertisement"}

He prefers to sleep on a rope cot, under the stars, the way they do in the village, and has never owned a pair of shoes that were not sandals. Leaving an interview with the talk show host Barkha Dutt, who is Oprah Winfrey-league famous in India, he turned to the man escorting him and asked, politely, who she was.\u201cA censor is seated inside me now,\u201d he said on Monday, at a book-signing organized by Penguin India. \u201cHe is testing every word that is born within me. His constant caution that a word may be misunderstood so, or it may be interpreted thus, is a real bother. But I\u2019m unable to shake him off.\u201dMr. Murugan\u2019s fictional villages are places full of quiet menace, where caste boundaries are protected with violence and social exclusion.When describing the farming communities of South India, Mr. Murugan is neither sentimental nor harsh; he describes it the way an entomologist might describe an insect.As a Ph.D. student, Mr. Murugan married a woman from a caste of potters, rather than his own higher landowning caste, the Gounders. His mother refused to attend the marriage, softening only when his wife bore her first child and moved to the village for six months. Two decades later, Mr. Murugan\u2019s relatives still remind him, in subtle ways, that his wife will never be accepted.It is notable that Mr. Murugan does not write with the expectation that his work will change anything.\u201cI never had such big hopes,\u201d he said in an interview, glancing down and smiling. Collective punishment, he said, \u201cis part of the narrative. My primary purpose is to explore the experience of the person who undergoes that humiliation.\u201dMr. Murugan barely spoke as a child, which gave him time to observe. His older brother was withdrawn from school after the ninth grade so he could help his father with the soda business, and became addicted to bootleg liquor sold in the same bottles. He killed himself at 42.Mr. Murugan became a writer, with a small but passionate following among Tamil intellectuals. At night he would go to sleep beside his young son at 8 p.m. and then rise at midnight and write for two to three hours during the quietest hours of the night. Many of his colleagues at the government college, where he taught Tamil, were unaware that he wrote fiction, he said on Monday.In clean, clear prose, he had produced five novels in the space of three years \u2013 \u201calmost flawless novels,\u201d said R. Sivapriya, senior editor at the digital publishing house Juggernaut, which commissioned English translations of three of Mr. Murugan\u2019s short stories this year. \u201cHe would train a microscope on one detail and tell that one story, and see the world through that one story,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a certain purity to him that won\u2019t be there now, I think. I think it will be a different writer.\u201dIn December 2014, he returned from a writer\u2019s retreat to his family\u2019s home in Namakkal to discover that he was the target of a well-organized campaign. Strangers called repeatedly to accuse him of slandering the Gounder caste in \u201cOne Part Woman,\u201d which had been released in an English translation, and he tried earnestly to explain his motivation. The aggression built, culminating in a book burning and a citywide strike.Mr. Murugan retuned to his home under police escort and posted a message on Facebook: \u201cPerumal Murugan the writer is dead. As he is not god, he is not going to resurrect himself. He also has no faith in rebirth. An ordinary teacher, he will live as P. Murugan. Leave him alone.\u201dOn Monday here in New Delhi, Mr. Murugan described a deep depression that followed, during which he neither read nor wrote. It ended, he said, in 2015, when he found himself at a friend\u2019s house, locked in a room stacked with books.\u201cWith nothing to do I lay dazed night and day,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as I ruminated over my existence, there came a certain instant when the sluice gates were breached. I began to write. I chronicled the moment when I felt like a rat, dazzled by the light, burrowing itself into its hole.\u201d The result was a book of poetry that went on sale on Monday, titled \u201cKozhayin Paadalkal,\u201d or \u201cSongs of a Coward.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Their criticisms have raised the question of how much \u2014 if at all \u2014 Ms. Schumer should be held responsible for the actions and attitudes of one of her writers, and whether her critics are simply overreacting by linking her to a writer whose sole aim is to provoke.In a phone interview on Thursday evening, Mr. Metzger said he was sorry if any of his comments seemed to suggest that rape victims should not believed.\u201cGod forbid, a rape victim thinks I\u2019m mocking them,\u201d he said. \u201cThat, I 100-percent apologize for.

{"Headline": "Where One Olympic Medal Is a Lot Better Than None", "Date": "2016-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The last hope for Cameroon to win a 2016 Olympic medal arrived in the wrestling arena on Thursday night in the stern and determined form of Annabel Laure Ali, a 31-year-old who would vie for a bronze in the women\u2019s freestyle competition. Gladiatorial rock music blasted from loudspeakers as Ali walked to the mat a few feet behind her opponent, Ekaterina Bukina of Russia.It had been a tough Olympics for this Central African nation of 22 million. The news media in Cameroon belittled the performance as \u201cOperation Zero Medals.\u201d By Thursday, at 5 p.m., only Ali could save the country from an Olympic shutout.\u201cI win, I lose,\u201d she had said in an interview about pressure a few hours earlier. \u201cI don\u2019t want to regret after.\u201dFor all their egalitarian aspirations, embodied by the parade in the opening ceremony, the Olympics are a highly lopsided affair. Through Saturday afternoon, the five most victorious countries had claimed nearly 40 percent of all the medals, and the top 10 owned about 55 percent.Most countries \u2014 more than 120 as of Friday \u2014 go home with nothing. For them, the Games are not so much about tallying up glories as staving off embarrassment. And for this sizable contingent, there is a huge difference between zero medals and one.Here is a breakdown of all the medals awarded and the athletes who have competed at each Olympics, starting with the 1896 Games in Athens. The schedule for the Games in Rio de Janeiro and all the medal winners there are also listed.Consider what happened last week with Austria. It is a winter sports powerhouse, but when the Rio Games began, it was in the midst of a Summer Games medal drought.The problem started at the 2012 London Olympics, when the country failed to take home so much as a bronze. The minister of sport at the time, Norbert Darabos, went to England during this debacle and denounced his country\u2019s athletes as \u201cOlympic tourists.\u201d He promised a new law that would focus funding on the most promising sports.\u201cWe have to change the structures in time so that we can win medals in Rio in 2016,\u201d he fumed in a 2012 interview, \u201cor else we will again be on the same level as Luxembourg. They won\u2019t win anything in London, either.\u201dThe upshot was \u201cProjekt Rio,\u201d a program funded with 20 million euros (about $22.5 million).It quickly looked like a waste of money. On the first full day of competition, a well-regarded judo fighter lost in just 27 seconds. The beach volleyball team was knocked out by the Cubans. There were injuries and weak performances. A sailing duo in the 49er class that seemed poised for greatness failed to make the medal race.Headlines at home were hostile. \u201cOlympic Debacle! We live in the stone age,\u201d wrote Kronen Zeitung. \u00d6sterreich went with \u201cEurope Laughs at Our Olympic Tourists,\u201d and got personal and pithy with this one: \u201cYou Are Embarrassing!\u201dWhen Day 13 rolled around, all of Austria\u2019s remaining chances resided with three sailing teams. Two of them came up short. The last of the races that day was the final in the mixed Nacra 17, a catamaran operated by a man and woman. (Hence \u201cmixed.\u201d) Tanja Frank and Thomas Zajac, the very blond Austrian Nacra 17 team, were hardly considered one of the country\u2019s more promising medal threats at the start of the Games.\u201cWe were really not in the small circle of favorites,\u201d Zajac said Thursday night. He was sitting on a sofa on the roof of Austria House, an event dining room for invited guests as well as party headquarters for Brazilians who want to stop by and dance outside to a disc jockey. \u201cThere were three or four favorites and then five or six that were in the hunt. We were one of those five or six.\u201dThey belonged in the circle of favorites, it turned out. Sailing has a complex system of scoring that factors in previous performances, but as soon as the pair crossed the finish line, they knew they had won bronze. So they did something that seems hard to imagine: They jumped into the water.\u201cYou win a medal, and you don\u2019t really care about the water,\u201d said Zajac, 30, his nose sunburned. \u201cYou feel like you\u2019ve survived everything.\u201dThe news media in Austria announced that the national summer medal drought had ended after exactly 2,923 days. Christian Kern, the country\u2019s chancellor, posted an exultant note on Facebook. The pair received hundreds of emails, texts and messages. Frank, who until Wednesday had only been asked about her I.Q., which has been reported to exceed 155, was finally asked about something else.\u201cThe next day,\u201d she said, \u201cwe were on the cover of every newspaper in Austria.\u201dLife for the national Olympic committee\u2019s spokesman, Wolfgang Eichler, has since improved, too. The notion of leaving Rio empty-handed, of another four years of drought counting, was hard to contemplate. A single bronze does not exactly represent a turnaround. \u201cBut now it\u2019s easier to do my work,\u201d Eichler said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as though now is all good, but at least we\u2019re celebrating a medal.\u201dAt the Olympic wrestling venue, Ali was trying do for Cameroon what Frank and Zajac had done for Austria. The match was the only close one of the night. At 4 minutes 17 seconds, Ali grabbed one of Bukina\u2019s legs and forced her to hop backward and out of the ring, tying the score at 3-3.See the Summer Games in a series of composite images.The seconds ticked down. Ali lunged again for Bukina\u2019s legs, missing this time, then dropped to one knee and lunged again. But Bukina twisted just enough to deflect Ali, who wound up on both knees. When Bukina swung around and grabbed her by the waist, she won 2 points. It happened at 5:58.Two seconds later, the match was over. Ali and Cameroon were out of the Olympics. It happened so fast that even Bukina seemed stunned.Ali passed through the interview zone without speaking, looking exhausted and inconsolable. But on her way out of the arena, she stopped to speak to a French reporter. \u201cI could taste the bronze,\u201d she told him.\u201cShe is to be celebrated, of course,\u201d said her coach, Dieudonn\u00e9 Ebouele Motto. \u201cBecause in all our delegation, she is the only one to have done something like this.\u201dMotto was speaking in French, through a volunteer interpreter named Davide Adams, who happened to be from Cameroon. She has a radiant smile, but even as it flashed, over and over, she said she wanted to cry.\u201cSo close,\u201d she said, writhing a little. \u201cDid you see how close it was? It was like she was going to win and then suddenly, she didn\u2019t. I can\u2019t believe it. Oh my God. I can\u2019t believe it.\u201dThe cosmic unfairness of the Games then started to bother her.\u201cThe U.S. gets all the medals,\u201d she said, finding the seam between outrage and amusement. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?

{"Headline": "\u2018The Night Of\u2019 Season 1, Episode 6: The Cat or the Yarn?", "Date": "2016-08-14", "News": "Supported byThe Night OfFor now, though, \u201cThe Night Of\u201d has to be coy about it. In shifting to the early days of the trial, \u201cSamson and Delilah\u201d foregrounds the whodunit aspects of the show, which means revealing new information on Naz and offering some more suspects who may or may not be red herrings. In digging around on Facebook, Box discovers that Naz switched high schools after his freshman year, transferring from a neighborhood school to one 40 minutes away by subway. It turns out that Naz received a two-week suspension for throwing another student down a flight of stairs, breaking his arm, and was unable to resettle after coming back. When Chandra questions him about it, Naz talks about the abuse he and members of his family absorbed after Sept. 11, framing the incident as retaliation. But he also admits to \u201cfeeling nothing\u201d afterward, other than a sliver of guilt over his mother\u2019s disappointment.For Stone and Chandra, this piece of information is the latest example of their client lying to them, but the news isn\u2019t all bad this week. Scanning surveillance footage at the gas station where Naz and Andrea stopped to fuel up, Chandra can be seen picking up on a hearse driver who says something to Andrea and follows them out of the station as they leave. When Chandra questions the driver, he refers to the biblical story of Samson and Delilah and talks about Andrea as a destroyer of men, \u201clike she the cat and you the yarn.\u201d The man seems like a classic red herring, but that fact that the episode is called \u201cSamson and Delilah\u201d lends his chilling speech some significance. The hearse driver may not be the culprit, but casting Andrea as the type of woman who attracts violence, if not instigates it, opens up the list of suspects.A likelier candidate is Andrea\u2019s stepfather, Don, who\u2019s already shown to be a sour, ill-tempered man with little apparent grief over her death. At the funeral, Stone picked up on a heated argument Don was having with another mourner, who turns out to be the financial adviser of Andrea\u2019s late mother. The adviser tells Stone off the record that Don stands to inherit a windfall from Andrea\u2019s death, because he can claim her half of his late wife\u2019s assets, including a brownstone that could be worth $10 million. Don\u2019s habit of dating older women of means marks him as a scam artist and gives him a strong motive for killing Andrea to collect the full inheritance. That Andrea used the phrase \u201cover my dead body\u201d to describe her stepfather\u2019s predatory only points more suspicion his way.All of this narrative business threatens to turn \u201cThe Night Of\u201d into souped-up \u201cLaw & Order,\u201d but as ever, the writer Richard Price sets it apart in the particulars. Stone\u2019s battle with eczema \u2014 which has become something of an internet obsession of late \u2014 ends abruptly with an herbal cocktail that clears his feet in time for the trial. Mr. Price treats it as a symbolic rite of passage: He\u2019s slipping into the dress shoes of a proper lawyer. Mr. Price also throws in the side business of unmonitored cellphone calls in prison, a monologue on \u201cgetting rid of nightmares\u201d in jury selection and the proper attire for defendants in criminal court. Even when it\u2019s cagey about its central mystery, the show continues to excel at the little things.Notes\u2022 Stone\u2019s efforts to minimize his cat allergy have gotten adorably absurd. The getup he wears to clean the litter box makes him look like a meth cook in \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d\u2022 This week brings the second example of an expert asking the prosecutor how she wants to angle the testimony. Last week, a pathologist offered to testify to a cut on Naz\u2019s hand consistent with his hand slipping down the knife handle. Now an expert is willing to testify that the drugs in Naz\u2019s body wouldn\u2019t keep him from committing the murder, despite the same cocktail leaving some people incapacitated.\u2022 Nice touch to show the potential jury pool sleeping through the obligatory video thanking them for fulfilling their constitutional duty. Sometimes the call to public service is answered with a yawn.\u2022 Freddy asks an important rhetorical question of Naz: \u201cDid you like your life out there?\u201d Naz cannot manage more than an affirmative shrug in reply. By taking a hit from Freddy\u2019s stash, he\u2019s prepping for a future where life on the inside will be more bearable.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Aims for an Edge in the Race for a Self-Driving Future", "Date": "2016-08-18", "News": "Supported byA world in which cars drive themselves may come sooner than once thought.On Thursday, Uber said that it would begin testing self-driving cars in Pittsburgh in a matter of weeks, allowing people in the city to hail modified versions of Volvo sport utility vehicles to get around the city.Uber also said it had acquired Otto, a 90-person start-up including former Google and Carnegie Mellon engineers that is focused on developing self-driving truck technology to upend the shipping industry.Those moves are the most recent indications of Uber\u2019s ambitions for autonomous vehicles that can provide services to both consumers and businesses.Suddenly, it seems, both Silicon Valley and Detroit are doubling down on their bets for autonomous vehicles. And in what could emerge as a self-driving-car arms race, the players are investing in, or partnering with, or buying outright the specialty companies most focused on the requisite hardware, software and artificial intelligence capabilities.Despite their multitude of sensors and processors, autonomous cars have a lot of trouble with some everyday aspects of driving.\u201cIt appears 2016 will go down in history as the year of the autonomous vehicle partnership,\u201d said Karl Brauer, an analyst with the auto research firm Kelley Blue Book.But the Ford and Uber initiatives are not without risk. Federal auto safety regulators are preparing guidelines for autonomous vehicles that may or may not include the need for a steering wheel or require the presence of a driver who can step in should computerized systems falter.In a nod to the highly experimental nature of its Pittsburgh plan, Uber intends to have an actual human being behind the wheel \u2014 just in case. But while Ford is looking five years out, Uber is moving aggressively toward driverless fleets, despite the regulatory uncertainties.\u201cThere\u2019s an urgency to our mission about being part of the future,\u201d Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s chief executive, said on Thursday in an interview. \u201cThis is not a side project. This is existential for us.\u201dThat explains Uber\u2019s other announcement on Thursday \u2014 its deal to buy Otto for undisclosed terms, to beef up its own in-house expertise in self-driving technology.The acquisition of Otto follows Uber\u2019s recent opening of an advanced technology center in Pittsburgh, in conjunction with Carnegie Mellon University. The company has also hired engineers directly away from Google, which has been immersed in developing autonomous cars for a decade.Like Uber, Google is intent on developing self-driving cars for urban taxi use \u2014 reasoning that the slow speeds and relatively predictable environment of city streets that can be thoroughly, digitally mapped is the best and safest near-term purpose of autonomous vehicles. But for Uber, such cars are not a side bet but a way to be more fully in control of its business by eliminating the need for drivers who expect to be paid.\u201cUber arguably has more at stake in creating self-driving cars than any other automotive entity,\u201d Mr. Brauer said.Although the market for big sales of fully self-driving cars is still years away, the investment and research activities are on a fast track.Uber plans to open a 180,000-square-foot facility in Palo Alto, Calif., to house Otto, which will operate as a stand-alone company focused specifically on upending the long-distance trucking industry. Otto engineers will also work out of offices in San Francisco and Pittsburgh.But that talent and technology will apply more broadly to the technology behind Uber\u2019s grander self-driving car efforts, Mr. Kalanick said. He said he believed that his company\u2019s approach \u2014 a combination of teaming up with hardware manufacturers, Otto\u2019s software expertise and a large network of more than 50 million monthly riders as recently as July \u2014 places Uber in the best position to be competitive with companies like Google.\u201cThe first company in the space is not always the winner,\u201d Anthony Levandowski, chief executive of Otto, said on Thursday. \u201cIntel was not the first chip maker. Facebook wasn\u2019t the first social network.\u201dThe self-driving revolution has already hit a few speed bumps, in vehicles that are not fully autonomous but employ some elements of the technology. The electric-car maker Tesla is under investigation by federal regulators looking into a fatal crash in May of a Tesla Model S sedan whose driver had the vehicle\u2019s Autopilot assisted-driving system engaged.After Joshua Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio, was killed driving a Tesla Model S in the first fatality involving a self-driving car, questions have arisen about the safety of the car\u2019s technology.The German automaker Daimler was forced recently to pull an advertisement in the United States that possibly overstated the safety of assisted-driving options in a new Mercedes-Benz model.And Google is continuously explaining how minor accidents are occurring in self-driving vehicles it has been testing for some time in California.But potential safety concerns have hardly slowed the pace of research and investment by G.M., Ford and others. In Uber\u2019s case, Mr. Kalanick said he was confident that government officials would approve self-driving vehicles once the industry proves their effectiveness in real-world conditions.\u201cRegulators are going to optimistically make it work, while making it safer for the whole community,\u201d he said.In the Pittsburgh pilot program, Uber plans not only to have human drivers aboard as a safety precaution. Passengers who use the vehicles will have to \u201copt in\u201d and agree to be participants in the road test before riding, according to Uber.G.M. and Lyft are also planning their own testing program for autonomous ride-hailing vehicles, although they have not disclosed details.That plan, along with this week\u2019s announcements by Uber and Ford make clear that the initial market for robotic cars will likely be for commercial fleets rather than vehicles consumers would park in their own garages.Industry analysts see ride-hailing firms and delivery businesses as natural customers for the first autonomous vehicles, in part because the cars and trucks are expected to carry high price tags.Ford officials said this week that ride-hailing services are able to generate the passenger revenues needed to cover the high cost of the cars.Raj Nair, Ford\u2019s global product development chief, said that eliminating human drivers would drastically lower the cost of a ride-hailing fare. By catering to those companies, Ford expects to build a small, but profitable business segment.Ford has not said how many self-driving vehicles it expects to produce on an annual basis, or whether it would adapt one of its current models or build an entirely new vehicle.But the company\u2019s chief executive, Mark Fields, pledged that the vehicles would \u201cbring mobility to millions of people\u201d who do not own cars themselves. And doing so will create a \u201cvery good business\u201d for Ford.Advertisement"}

Do you think we\u2019ll see an Uber I.P.O. in 2017?When you eliminate something they\u2019ve poured hundreds of millions of dollars into, it makes it far easier to gain public market confidence when you make your shares available for sale.Also, um, early Uber investors and employees want a return on the billions of dollars of stock they\u2019re sitting on but can do little with until the company goes public. Travis will have to stop ignoring that at some point.So in short, yes \u2014 2017 I.P.O. is my guess.The new Instagram feature is called Stories; it\u2019s a copy of a Snapchat feature also called Stories. In each one, you snap a photo or video to add to a diarylike video of things that happened in your day. Each montage lasts only 24 hours before it disappears, which adds a kind of tossed-off, casual sensibility to your social profile.\u201cWhen She Looked Under Her Couch Cushions and Saw THIS.\u2026 I Was SHOCKED!\u201dor\u201cHe Put Garlic in His Shoes Before Going to Bed and What Happens Next Is Hard to Believe.\u201dI have to say, I really want to know what happened with the garlic shoes thing. Anyway, there are lots of news sites online that thrive on this kind of deceptive headline, so I\u2019m glad that Facebook is pushing against these. In fact, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going far enough, as I\u2019ll explain below \u2014 but first, do you have any thoughts on this?I think Facebook is up against a different problem now. This system apparently doesn\u2019t work for videos that are uploaded directly to Facebook, which is pretty much how every new media organization is posting videos these days. BuzzFeed is basically a video site, as are Mashable and a few others. I figure enterprising publications will find a way to game the system that way, eventually, though I\u2019m not sure how.This probably also won\u2019t assuage fears that Facebook is essentially an editorial organization, making editorial decisions about what should and should not be seen by the masses. They don\u2019t really deny this positioning per se \u2014 they published a list of values a few months ago on the matter \u2014 but they also probably don\u2019t want to be seen as competing with some of their biggest partners. Also, Facebook most likely doesn\u2019t see itself through this lens, but it usually never sees itself the way the outside world perceives it.But I don\u2019t think addressing clickbait headlines is enough. In general, headlines, which are really an artifact of the print newspaper, have not evolved enough for online news. In print newspapers, headlines generally appeared on the same page as the story, and there were lots of other clues \u2014 photos, captions, pull-quotes, subheads \u2014 that informed the rushed reader.Online, headlines are usually first encountered on social streams like Facebook\u2019s news feed, and the rest of the article is available only after you click. This means they function more as marketing tools than as information. News companies want you to click on them and read the whole story, so the headlines try to be pithy and clever and not give everything away.As a one-off, that\u2019s not so bad. But if your daily stream presents you with hundreds of headlines that don\u2019t tell you much, and if you\u2019re only clicking on a handful (because you\u2019re busy), you\u2019re not really getting the day\u2019s news.That\u2019s why I think headlines for online news should become longer and more informative \u2014 they should be more like ministories than like a tagline for a movie. For a good example of this, look at the news module on the right side of The New York Times\u2019s home page, which gives you a little summary of a story rather than a snappy headline.Sure, this might make news more boring. But it would have the collective effect of making it much more informative, which is a good thing.Anyway, I theoretically agree with you, but I also have to get old on you for a second. Part of the beauty of headlines is in the art of a perfectly crafted one: pithy, clever, striking. Perfect for the tone of the article with just enough sass or information to entice you further. It\u2019s a practice Times copy editors have mastered in many ways.Does artfulness work in an age of search engine optimization and clickbait-killing algorithms? Probably not. But if we do usher in a wave of so-called more informative headlines as you propose, I\u2019ll be sad to see the old ones go.Or in Timesian convention: \u201cIn Era of New Headlines, a Times Writer Feels Bummed.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Instagram Takes a Page From Snapchat, and Takes Aim at It, Too", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "Supported byMENLO PARK, Calif. \u2014 For nearly four years, Snapchat has been Facebook\u2019s white whale.Now Instagram, the photo-sharing app owned by Facebook, is for the first time taking its own stab at Snapchat.The move could ignite a head-to-head battle between Instagram and Snapchat, which have long lurked in each other\u2019s territories but have not faced off directly. Both are mobile apps that use primarily visual media. Both became popular first with young people. And both are now trying to improve their businesses by increasing digital advertising in formats like Stories.Kevin Systrom, co-founder and chief executive of Instagram, did not mention Snapchat by name in an interview about Instagram Stories, but obliquely referred to \u201ccompetitors\u201d and acknowledged that \u201cother companies deserve all the credit\u201d for popularizing disappearing photos and videos. It has been an area of interest for Instagram for some time, he said.Instagram Stories aims to lower the bar for sharing all types of photos and video \u2014 and not just the carefully planned and painstakingly touched-up photographs that are typical of the service, Mr. Systrom said.\u201cOur mission has always been to capture and share the world\u2019s moments, not just the world\u2019s most beautiful moments,\u201d he said. \u201cStories will alleviate a ton of the pressure people have to post their absolute best stuff.\u201dA spokeswoman for Snapchat declined to comment on Instagram\u2019s new product.Cathy Boyle, a mobile analyst for the research firm eMarketer, said Instagram\u2019s move \u201cvalidates what Snapchat is doing.\u201d Advertisers are particularly attracted to Snapchat, she said, because the messaging app offers \u201ca place to connect with users in this very personal, immersive way.\u201dSnapchat \u2014 led by Evan Spiegel, who helped found it while an undergraduate at Stanford University \u2014 started in 2011. The private messaging service, with its disappearing photos, was the opposite of the public nature of social media services like Instagram. Young audiences flocked to Snapchat precisely because an unflattering photo sent to a friend would last for mere seconds rather than a lifetime, and would not show up for parents or a future employer to find.Snapchat Stories, a departure from the company\u2019s original direct messaging service, has been a hit for essentially acting as a 24-hour photo and video diary viewable only by those who follow the user.Beyond that, Snapchat Stories also collects photos and videos users have contributed from a particular event \u2014 say the Teen Choice Awards \u2014 and stitches them together to form a narrative. The result feels more like a television show than a social media post; companies like AMC and HP can buy ads that are placed in stories, much like commercials aired in original programming.The rivalry between Snapchat and Instagram was evident in a report published last week from the investment banking firm Jefferies, which predicted that Snapchat\u2019s growth could detract from Instagram\u2019s advertising momentum by as soon as the fourth quarter of this year.\u201cSnapchat consists of a more active user base, which creates more content than the average Instagram user,\u201d the report said. \u201cGiven its younger demographic, we think Instagram looks the most at-risk from the rise of Snapchat, especially on a longer-term basis.\u201dInstagram Stories is now available in a separate section of the app, where users can shoot photos or video, which, as with Snapchat, can be adorned with text or drawings. Those are then combined to create a story, which is viewable by friends for 24 hours. People can make stories public or private, and can choose if they want only a subsection of their followers to view them.Mr. Systrom does not pretend that Instagram Stories is original. Instead, he said the narrative string of photos and video that disappear after 24 hours is a format, akin to the cascading feed-based model popularized by companies like Facebook and Twitter and eventually adopted by countless others. Silicon Valley, he said, is all about creating and adopting new formats to be tried and expanded.\u201cThis format unlocks a new version of creativity for us,\u201d he said. \u201cI think Instagram will be judged by where we go from here, and what we make of it in the future.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rediscovering the Kitchen, and Other Tips for Heart Health", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "Jane Brody on health and aging.The new data, published in June in JAMA Cardiology, covered the years from 2000 through 2014. From 2000 through 2010, the annual rates of decline for all cardiovascular deaths  heart diseases and stroke  averaged 3.69 percent for men and 3.98 percent for women. But since 2011, the rates of decline dropped to a mere 0.23 percent for men and 1.17 percent for women.These findings point to near stagnation in controlling cardiovascular diseases and deaths, Dr. Stephen Sidney and colleagues wrote. And, they noted, the reasons are not difficult to discern. Based on data from the latest National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2011-12, Americans did better in controlling three major risk factors  smoking, high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol, often with the help of medication  but many more people became obese and developed Type 2 diabetes.According to data from the survey, the prevalence of adult obesity rose from 22.9 percent in 1988-1994 to 34.9 percent in 2011-12, and the C.D.C. found that the prevalence of diabetes nearly tripled, from 2.5 percent in 1990 to 7.2 percent in 2013.Furthermore, the national survey showed, the percentage of adults who in 2012 were consuming an ideal diet that could minimize life-threatening damage to blood vessels was near zero.Now for the good news: Neither medical innovations nor genetic interventions are needed to turn the tide on cardiovascular diseases and deaths and restore their once-significant declines. And the very same changes needed to improve cardiovascular health may also help prevent many common cancers, diabetes, arthritis, cognitive decline, depression and osteoporosis.Dr. Donald M. Lloyd-Jones, a chief architect of a 2010 strategic plan to improve cardiovascular health, said: The whole may be greater than the sum of the parts. We shouldnt assume that chronic diseases automatically occur with aging. Living healthfully until we die is an achievable goal.Heres how the committee defined ideal: No smoking; maintaining a body mass index below 25; being physically active; following current dietary guidelines; and maintaining an untreated total cholesterol level of less than 200 milligrams, an untreated blood pressure level of less than 120 over 80, and a fasting blood glucose level of less than 100 milligrams.The committee had hoped that fostering these seven health behaviors and targets would, by 2020, improve the cardiovascular health of all Americans by 20 percent while reducing deaths from cardiovascular diseases and stroke by 20 percent.But current trends project at best a 6 percent improvement.Still, he has not given up hope for a better result.Now for the details. First and foremost, quit smoking or never start. Heart risks drop significantly within a year of quitting and eventually reach those of a nonsmoker.Exercise should be part of your daily routine, like brushing your teeth. I do a combination of moderate and vigorous exercise every day. It energizes me and helps me control my weight without having to watch every calorie.As for diet, the committee recommended focusing on foods, not nutrients. (As Dr. Lloyd-Jones put it, We dont eat nutrients.) It refrained from suggesting how many calories people should eat, since caloric needs vary tremendously based on an individuals basal metabolic rate, body size, lean body mass and physical activity.At the same time, limit saturated fats to less than 7 percent of total calories and daily sodium to 1,500 milligrams for people with high blood pressure and no more than 2,300 milligrams (or one teaspoon of salt) for everyone else. Currently, Americans consume an average of 3,500 milligrams of sodium a day, most of it from processed and restaurant foods.Which brings me to a final recommendation of my own: Rediscover your kitchen. No matter how busy you are, finding time to prepare healthy foods for yourself and your family should be a top priority.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "One Secret to Cutting Spending: Wait 72 Hours Before You Buy", "Date": "2016-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySketch GuyI\u2019m going to assume for a minute that you\u2019re one of the millions of people who have a recurrently frustrating relationship with spending. It probably starts with a commitment to sticking to your budget, and you do for a few days. Then, despite your resolve, you break down, pull out the credit card and do something that you promised you wouldn\u2019t. You wake up in the morning ashamed and resolve never to do it again.Then you repeat.Been there? Done that?Frustrated, you wonder what\u2019s wrong. You\u2019re smart, you\u2019re successful, and when you set your mind to something, you\u2019re able to do it.I think we can all relate. If not money, insert food. So what can we do about this problem of knowing we should act one way but repeatedly doing something different?The answer lies in understanding the relationship between the stimulus to do something, how we respond and a little secret I\u2019ll share in a minute.But first, here\u2019s the problem as I see it: Almost all personal finance advice focuses on controlling the stimulus or your response to it. Gurus tell you to stop looking at Instagram, stay off Facebook, fire all your nonfrugal friends and disown your spendthrift family members. That is an effort to control the stimulus.Then, you\u2019re told to control your response. Most of this advice centers on making it painful to spend. Cut up your credit cards. Use only cash. Track, review and feel bad about your spending.It works until it doesn\u2019t anymore. You can\u2019t ignore all the voices screaming at you to spend, and making spending painful increases the feelings of shame when we do something wrong. It only leads to more spending as a form of self-medicating.Whoa! There is a third element to this little dance with stimulus and response. To break this frustrating spending cycle, we can focus on creating space between the two of them.It starts by acknowledging that the space exists. Most of us don\u2019t even know it\u2019s there. We see a Twitter post about a book someone likes, the post has a link to Amazon, we click the \u201cone click buy\u201d button, and then we own a book with little to no thought.So we need to practice pausing once we\u2019re in that space between. The advice to use cash or to lock up the credit cards can be useful here if it creates space between our desire to buy and our actual buying. It can also be as simple as training ourselves to notice the desire. How does it feel to want something?I didn\u2019t need to bar myself from reading book reviews or allow myself to buy books only with cash. By adding a little space, I gave myself the opportunity to change my response. How you add space is up to you, but once you get good at creating it, then some of the other things matter less.This is just one simple trick to create space. I think you\u2019ll find that by focusing on the space between, you can let go of your anxious grasp on the stimulus and response. If you get the space right, the other two take care of themselves.I\u2019d love to hear from you. What have you done to create space? How has it helped you?Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of an Austrian psychiatrist on second reference.

{"Headline": "Arianna Huffington Is Leaving Huffington Post", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "Supported bySince it started 11 years ago, The Huffington Post has been synonymous with the personality and the interests of its co-founder, Arianna Huffington.The pioneering web publication, known for its aggressive use of aggregation and an unapologetically liberal worldview, would go on to win a Pulitzer Prize and expand globally during a challenging time for all media organizations.But over the last year, The Huffington Post has found itself an increasingly small part of an increasingly large media and tech conglomerate. When Verizon, which announced it had purchased The Huffington Post\u2019s parent company, AOL, in May 2015, bought Yahoo\u2019s internet business last month, Ms. Huffington\u2019s perch at the company seemed increasingly precarious.With her abrupt announcement on Thursday that she was stepping down as editor in chief of The Huffington Post and leaving the company to focus on her new venture, a health and wellness start-up called Thrive Global, she leaves the publication in an unfamiliar position. For the first time since its founding in 2005, The Huffington Post will be without Ms. Huffington. No successor was named.In an interview, Ms. Huffington, 66, said she had originally intended to run The Huffington Post while working to start Thrive Global. But that plan soon reached its limits.\u201cThe original idea was that I could do both,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it very quickly turned out to be an illusion.\u201dAlong with her success, Ms. Huffington has been a polarizing figure in the media world, and her presence in the newsroom has not always been constant. But since Verizon bought AOL, her interests seemed to increasingly move beyond running The Huffington Post. After the sale, there was speculation that she would leave the company, concerns allayed when she signed a four-year contract in June 2015.Other moves have generated misgivings in the newsroom. The publication\u2019s decision last summer to put articles about Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign in its entertainment section and a later decision to add an editor\u2019s note calling Mr. Trump a \u201cserial liar\u201d and a \u201cracist\u201d to any article about him raised questions about whether Ms. Huffington was unduly influencing coverage to suit her political agenda.In April, the announcement that she was joining Uber\u2019s board rankled employees who feared inherent conflicts of interest in coverage. (She said she would recuse herself from being involved with any coverage of the company.) The publication has also been criticized for what some see as excessive coverage of sleep and wellness, topics on which Ms. Huffington has written books.At the same time, staff attrition, evidenced by a flurry of goodbye emails over the last year, has taken a toll on morale. In that context, Ms. Huffington\u2019s decision to leave surprised an already anxious newsroom.At a staff meeting Thursday morning in The Huffington Post\u2019s Manhattan headquarters, Ms. Huffington stressed her confidence in the organization. \u201cGreat companies always succeed beyond their founder,\u201d she said, according to an article by Michael Calderone, the publication\u2019s media reporter. \u201cEven though HuffPost bears my name, it is absolutely about all of you and about this amazing team we\u2019ve been for over 11 years.\u201dTim Armstrong, the chief executive of AOL, was not present. But in a statement, he called Ms. Huffington a \u201cvisionary who built The Huffington Post into a truly transformative news platform.\u201d\u201cToday, The Huffington Post is a firmly established and celebrated news source, and AOL and Verizon are committed to continuing its growth and the groundbreaking work Arianna pioneered,\u201d he added.When The Huffington Post was founded, there was no Twitter, and Facebook was still a relatively fledgling online platform primarily used by college students. Initially, the idea was to create an aggregation site that would be a liberal counterpart to the Drudge Report. Ms. Huffington, who had recently run for governor of California, said at the time that she had signed up more than 250 of \u201cthe most creative minds\u201d in the country, including Walter Cronkite, Nora Ephron and Norman Mailer, to write a group blog on topics including politics and entertainment.The Huffington Post did not just take the internet seriously; it ruthlessly embraced as opportunities trends that established media companies perceived as threats. The company demonstrated early and continued mastery over Google, capturing audiences through search with carefully engineered headlines and fast aggregation. The publication consistently outranked its competitors in search, often with blog posts based on its competitors\u2019 work. But while the strategy proved successful, the site\u2019s ability to package articles from other publications also prompted criticism, and many in the media world accused it of aggregation excesses that bordered on intellectual theft.Over the years, however, it has pushed aggressively to produce more original content. The site also published articles by non-journalists, who often contributed without being paid.AOL purchased the publication for $315 million in 2011 and Ms. Huffington assumed control of AOL\u2019s editorial content. The Huffington Post won a Pulitzer Prize in 2012 for a series on wounded veterans.Ms. Huffington\u2019s relationship with Mr. Armstrong was rocky almost from the start, several current and former employees said, and some said her outside interests kept her out of the newsroom for extended periods.When AOL sold itself to Verizon for $4.4 billion, there was speculation that Ms. Huffington might leave. She had become an increasingly powerful force in her own right: She has published several books on health and wellness, including \u201cThrive\u201d and \u201cThe Sleep Revolution,\u201d and she has become a champion of the benefits of a good night\u2019s sleep.Though Ms. Huffington\u2019s departure came as a shock, it was in some ways inevitable, particularly after she announced the formation of Thrive Global in June.In the interview, Ms. Huffington said she had thought about leaving The Huffington Post for \u201ca while,\u201d and the closing of a funding round for Thrive Global last week ultimately drove her move. \u201cIt was my decision\u201d to leave, she said, adding that the contract she signed last year had a carve-out clause that allowed her to start a new venture.Ms. Huffington said she would stay on at the publication until early September.\u201cI\u2019m going to be very much around for the rest of the month, helping in every way I can, including having Greek sweets in my office,\u201d she said, a nod to her home country and her distinctive accent.Mr. Armstrong said in a note to staff that the company had formed an interim editorial committee that would act in Ms. Huffington\u2019s place. The committee will also be involved in what Mr. Armstrong described as \u201can ongoing search\u201d for a new editor in chief.In a separate note to employees, Jared Grusd, the chief executive of The Huffington Post, called Thursday a \u201cday of change.\u201d\u201cToday,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis the first day of the next chapter in HuffPost\u2019s history.\u201dJohn Herrman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

This is a historically peculiar election cycle, boisterously disrupted by outsiders, one of whom found the perfect host body in the Republican Party and became its presidential nominee. An investigation of voter estrangement has never felt more urgent, and we\u2019re certainly not getting one from the lacquered chatterers on the boob tube.Now, along comes Mr. Vance, offering a compassionate, discerning sociological analysis of the white underclass that has helped drive the politics of rebellion, particularly the ascent of Donald J. Trump. Combining thoughtful inquiry with firsthand experience, Mr. Vance has inadvertently provided a civilized reference guide for an uncivilized election, and he\u2019s done so in a vocabulary intelligible to both Democrats and Republicans.Imagine that.On the checklist of modern privilege, Mr. Vance, 31, has the top four in the bag: He is white, male, straight and Protestant.But his profile is misleading. His people \u2014 hillbillies, rednecks, white trash, choose your epithet (or term of affection, depending on your point of view) \u2014 didn\u2019t step off the Mayflower and become part of America\u2019s ascendant class. \u201cPoverty is the family tradition,\u201d he writes. His ancestors and kin were sharecroppers, coal miners, machinists, millworkers \u2014 all low-paying, body-wearying occupations that over the years have vanished or offered diminished security.Mr. Vance was raised in Middletown, Ohio, a now-decaying steel town filled with Kentucky transplants, which at one point included his Mamaw and Papaw \u2014 in newscaster English, that\u2019s grandma and grandpa \u2014 who moved there shortly after World War II. Though the couple eventually managed to achieve the material comforts of a middle-class life (house, car), they brought their Appalachian values and habits with them. Some were wonderfully positive, like loyalty and love of country. But others, like a tendency toward violence and verbal abuse, were inimical to family life.Papaw was forever coming home drunk. Mamaw, \u201ca violent nondrunk,\u201d was forever tormenting him, whether by serving him artfully arranged plates of garbage for dinner or dousing him with gasoline. All this guerrilla warfare affected their children. Mr. Vance\u2019s mother was an empress of instability \u2014 violent, feckless, prone to hysteria. A long stint in rehab couldn\u2019t shake her addiction to prescription narcotics (she\u2019d later move on to heroin). She spun through more boyfriends than this reader could count and at least five husbands.The only reason Mr. Vance made it out in one piece is because his grandparents eventually reconciled, becoming his unofficial guardians. (He also spent a terrifically affirming four years in the Marines.) Mamaw was especially encouraging. She was tough as snakeskin, foul-mouthed as a mobster and filled with love. In a town where many children don\u2019t finish high school, she raised a grandson who managed to graduate from Ohio State University and Yale Law School, defying skyscraping odds.\u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d in my mind, divides into two components: the family stories Mr. Vance tells \u2014 most of which are no doubt better experienced on the page than they were in real life \u2014 and the questions he raises. Chief among them: How much should he hold his hillbilly kin responsible for their own misfortunes?In Mr. Vance\u2019s estimation, the answer is: a lot. Economic insecurity, he\u2019s convinced, accounts for only a small part of his community\u2019s problems; the much larger issue is hillbilly culture itself. Though proud of it in many ways, he\u2019s also convinced that it \u201cincreasingly encourages social decay instead of counteracting it.\u201dHis frustration with the nonworking white poor is especially acute. He recalls being a cashier at a Middletown grocery store and watching resentfully as his neighbors, who had creatively gamed the welfare system, jabbered on their cellphones as they were going through the checkout line.He could not afford a cellphone.\u201cPolitical scientists have spent millions of words trying to explain how Appalachia and the South went from staunchly Democratic to staunchly Republican in less than a generation,\u201d Mr. Vance writes. He suspects those cellphones have a lot to do with it. \u201cI could never understand why our lives felt like a struggle while those living off of government largess enjoyed trinkets that I only dreamed about.\u201dTime and again, Mr. Vance preaches a message of tough love and personal responsibility. He has no patience with an old acquaintance who told him he quit his job because he hated waking up early, only to take to Facebook to blame the \u201cObama economy.\u201d Or with a former co-worker at a tile warehouse who missed work once a week though his girlfriend was pregnant.The difference is that President Obama believes poverty, though it may have a cultural component, is largely a structural problem, one the government can play a large role in fixing. Mr. Vance, a conservative, takes a far dimmer view.Whether you agree with Mr. Vance or not, you must admire him for his head-on confrontation with a taboo subject. And he frames his critique generously, stipulating that it isn\u2019t laziness that\u2019s destroying hillbilly culture but what the psychologist Martin Seligman calls \u201clearned helplessness\u201d \u2014 the fatalistic belief, born of too much adversity, that nothing can be done to change your lot.What he\u2019s really writing about is despair.Never is Mr. Vance more aware of this pessimism and estrangement than when he leaves for Ohio State University. He\u2019s plumped with hope; his neighbors, left behind, feel its opposite. \u201cThere was something almost spiritual,\u201d he writes, \u201cabout the cynicism of the community at large.\u201dHis friends and relations are convinced that the media lies. That politicians lie. That the military, an institution they revere, is fighting two fruitless wars. Universities feel \u201crigged\u201d and inaccessible; job prospects are slim. For what purpose do you live under such circumstances? When the stanchions of your life have sunk into the muck?Mr. Vance doesn\u2019t have all the answers. But he\u2019s advancing the conversation.Hillbilly ElegyA Memoir of a Family and Culture in CrisisBy J. D. Vance264 pages. Harper. $27.99.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s a grim, detailed, quotidian drama about the inner workings of organized crime (which has drawn comparisons to \u201cThe Wire\u201d) and at the same time it\u2019s a traditional Mafia saga, a clan melodrama centering on succession and the ups and downs of the family business (which has drawn comparisons to \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d and \u201cThe Godfather\u201d). Either of these by itself might not be very interesting, but the combination is handled so adroitly that the show sucks you in. It doesn\u2019t have the emotional or stylistic highs of those predecessors, but it carries you along like one of the sleek Italian motorcycles preferred by its wealthier characters.The 12-episode first season (a second has already been shown in Europe) centers on two members of a drug gang in the Naples suburbs who are like a foster-family version of Sonny and Michael Corleone. Gennaro (Salvatore Esposito) is a Sonny-like hothead, unfit to be in charge but eventually thrust into the role because he\u2019s the only son of the boss. Ciro (Marco D\u2019Amore, whose quiet charisma holds your attention) is a coldly efficient killer and canny strategist \u2014 he\u2019s the Michael, but because he\u2019s not in the family, he has to work with Gennaro, or appear to.The relationship of these two up-and-comers, playing out amid a large cast of other familiar Mafia-drama types (the ruthless but declining boss, the calculating mother, the good soldier, the aggrieved wife), proceeds through an arc of increasingly operatic violence, as rival clans fight for turf and one massacre begets another. The story line is dark, and so is the screen. Under the guidance of the showrunner, Stefano Sollima, the show makes a fetish of low light and shadow. Its most characteristic scenes are not chases and shootouts but small groups of nervous or celebratory men meeting in the dark. They gather on street corners, in crowded discos and in abandoned buildings that serve as drug markets, their faces obscured or invisible. Even during the day, they\u2019re in curtained rooms or prison cells.The cinematography and lighting fit with the show\u2019s overall sense of desolation, a depiction of the Neapolitan environment as rubble-filled, overgrown and derelict. (Scenes set in Milan offer a pointed comparison to the less prosperous south.) Much of the action is set in faceless, towering apartment blocks that recall the settings of Italian neorealist films, though touches of lyricism creep in, like a beach scene in which a pair of horse carts passing in the background feel like early Fellini.Mr. Sollima and his colleagues are certainly aware of the many influences to be sorted through in making a modern gangster tale. At one point a young hood, describing the botched job that got him imprisoned, says that cops and helicopters arrived \u201cjust like an American movie.\u201d In \u201cGomorrah,\u201d they\u2019ve achieved a satisfying international blend.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Restaurant Owner Spurns Those Who Are O.K. With AR-15s", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "Supported byShe reflected, too, on her typical response to the nation\u2019s litany of gun massacres.\u201cWe write Facebook posts, we copy and paste, and we talk about it with people who basically agree with us,\u201d Ms. Verrill, 38, said the other day. \u201cWe\u2019ve never really done anything outside the box with regard to gun control.\u201dSo she again turned to the universal soapbox of Facebook. This time she took a stand, knowing it could hurt her business in a pro-gun, largely rural state, where hunting and target practice are immensely popular and where the political schisms run deep.She wrote that anyone who owned a high-powered semiautomatic rifle similar to the one used in Orlando was not welcome in either of her two restaurants. That was not all: She would not welcome anyone who merely supported the idea of owning such a weapon.Some chains have declared themselves gun-free zones, often in response to state \u201copen carry\u201d laws that allow people to take unconcealed firearms into establishments like restaurants, including those that serve alcohol.Ms. Verrill went a step further than most, spurning those who support the right to own a particularly lethal type of weapon \u2014 whether they own one or not.\u201cI cannot, in good conscience, accept anyone inside of my restaurants who believes that this is OK,\u201d she wrote.Supporters of gun rights vented their fury toward Ms. Verrill on social media. They called for a boycott of her restaurants and posted hundreds of negative online reviews of Grace, an upscale establishment that has been called one of the best restaurants in Maine \u2014 and, with its vaulted ceiling and stained glass windows, one of the most visually striking. They took particular umbrage at her effort to weed out patrons based on their beliefs.The backlash on social media quickly led her to delete the Facebook post. She said that she stood by her views but that the post had become a platform for haters.Her critics migrated to that post. \u201cIt\u2019s far too late to hide your moronic post from earlier,\u201d one commenter wrote. \u201cYour stupidity has since gone viral and your rating on Facebook has plummeted.\u201dLooking back now, Ms. Verrill said in an interview, she wishes she had worded her original post differently because it gave critics an opening to question how exactly she would bar people for their beliefs \u2014 a distraction from her main point about the horror of gun violence. Many said she was behaving no differently from a baker who would not make a cake for a same-sex wedding, but she rejected that analogy.\u201cGun owners are not a protected class,\u201d she said. \u201cOwning a gun is a choice. It bears literally no resemblance to the biological nature of the color of your skin or your sexual orientation.\u201dStill, trying to bar people based on their beliefs would most likely draw a legal challenge.Seven weeks after her original post, things have stabilized, Ms. Verrill said. She has not lost any business, she said, and the tourist season is in full swing. While the attacks from people across the country surprised her, so did the extent of the support.Recent diners included Erica Smegielski, the daughter of Dawn Hochsprung, the principal who was killed in the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown.And they included Dan and Sue Fogel, tourists from North Carolina who visited Grace for dinner last week after their Uber driver recommended it. They were unaware of Ms. Verrill\u2019s stance on guns, but once they learned about it, they were pleased to be dining there.\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing on guns isn\u2019t working, and we have to do something different,\u201d said Mr. Fogel, 69, a college professor.Eric Goldberg, 43, an insurance executive from New York who took his family to Grace after his wife read a review, was more ambivalent.\u201cWhile I admire the owner for trying to address an issue she cares about, I am not comfortable with business owners deciding who to serve based on their beliefs,\u201d he said.In all the hubbub over her stance, Ms. Verrill was surprised that members of a nearby gun club wanted to speak to her in person.Tammy Walter, the president of the Spurwink Rod & Gun Club in Cape Elizabeth, said she and three others had met with Ms. Verrill at her restaurant in early July and talked for 90 minutes. Neither side changed the other\u2019s opinion, but both said the discussion had been civil.Ms. Walter said in an interview that she had apologized for writing a fake restaurant review that gave Grace zero stars. But, she added, she wanted Ms. Verrill to understand that she had offended responsible gun owners by lumping them in the same category as the Orlando gunman.Ms. Walter also said she would like to go back to the restaurant sometime for dinner. When told of Ms. Walter\u2019s desire, Ms. Verrill said that she worried that such a visit would be more of a publicity stunt and that her impulse would be to ask her to leave.But Ms. Verrill added: \u201cIf I saw her in her cardigan and pearls sitting at a table, I don\u2019t think I would have the heart to ask her to get up and leave. And I guess that is the crux of taking a big stand in a small community.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Tyranny of Other People\u2019s Vacation Photos", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "Supported byCirca NowChief among my favorite Facebook memories is the time that a high-powered journalist of my acquaintance breezily informed us all that he was at the Grill Room of the Four Seasons with Ted Danson, tucking into some sea urchin. To which one friend responded, \u201cThat\u2019s funny, because I\u2019m at the Midtown tunnel with Rhea Perlman, eating shawarma.\u201dWhat prompts the excessive posting of these pictures?Indeed, the motivation behind many fahvolous vacation photos would seem to be a rationalization of large expenditures for the purpose of recreation: a $6,000 beach rental ought to bring you $6,000 worth of pleasure, and maybe posting a photo will get the dopamine flowing.But one can detect other motives, too: a tone-deaf attempt at self-branding, a neurotic attempt to thank your host, a need for constant scrutiny.Noxious selfie sticks now seem like nothing compared to the sophisticated camera filters that can turn an average-looking strawberry patch into a brooding welter of Caravaggio-esque chiaroscuro.Equally jarring, some Instagram and Facebook users seem to want us to know that their summer is more inherently summery than ours: more barefoot, more glistening, more sarong-driven.These folks are biting into the fresh fig of life, and this biting produces carefree laughter. My natural habitat is an oceanside bonfire where a Viggo Mortensen look-alike strums a weathered guitar! All backyards are enlivened by a spray of 8-year-old girls in sundresses! Everything I eat in August is cooked on a stick!\u201cI have a client who really wants Likes, so he posts a lot of photos,\u201d Dr. Vannucci said. \u201cWhen people don\u2019t respond to them, he feels very alone. So he posts more. It\u2019s a cycle like any interpersonal cycle in which we\u2019re doing something that people hate but we\u2019re doing it to try to make people like us. With that type of client, I try to find out what the motivation for posting is: What are the feelings around it? What is he looking for? Then I try to help him find other outlets.\u201dFor those on the receiving end of such founts of images, the critical factors are frequency and tone. On the frequency front, young Mr. Haynes had a good suggestion: \u201cI think you get three photos per location.\u201d If you can\u2019t remember whether you already posted a picture of that covered bridge, you are in danger of overestimating other people\u2019s interest in covered bridges.The question of tone is more nuanced. In 2014, the software company CyberLink sponsored a poll of 2,268 adults in the United States, \u201cwith the hypothesis,\u201d the company\u2019s senior vice president for global marketing, Richard Carriere, told me, \u201cthat some people have a tendency to post photos on social media just to gloat and annoy their friends and colleagues.\u201dThe study found that one in seven who own a smartphone and who use social media would unfollow or block someone who posts what they perceive as boastful vacation pictures. Moreover, one in four will attempt to share a photo within one hour of arriving at their destination \u2014 which makes many of us want to summon from deep within us the turban-wearing drama teacher who gets two syllables out of \u201cBreeeeathe.\u201dThe top reasons that those sampled said they would Like or Favorite a picture were: if it showed friends and family sharing a special moment (63 percent), they look happy (58 percent) or they look genuine and natural (48 percent). I expressed surprise to Mr. Carriere that the poll didn\u2019t break down the specifics of bothersome photos.I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to guess that the most troublesome one would be a vacation photo in which your ex is dating someone who\u2019s essentially you, but 15 years younger, and it\u2019s a picture of the two of them in the tiny fishing village in Portugal that you turned your ex on to in the first place.\u201dMr. Carriere said, \u201cI would definitely unfriend my ex for that.\u201dThe letter concluded with: \u201cGo have some kids and don\u2019t be so selfish as to only think of yourselves all the time.\u201d Yet one of the trips the couple had taken was a trip to New York that they had bought at a breast cancer benefit, not to mention the fact that the wife of the couple works as a psychotherapist who specializes in helping sexually and physically abused children.Equally odd were the facts that the letter\u2019s envelope was emblazoned with a bright yellow smiley sticker and that the postmark was Miami, a city that none of the couple\u2019s friends live in. So maybe the letter writer was on vacation at the time.The wife of the couple put the letter on Facebook with the instruction: \u201cPlease feel free to unfriend us from Facebook as we clearly are not \u2018friends.\u2019 If you\u2019re unsure how to unfriend someone, go to the \u2018Help\u2019 menu.\u201dThe couples\u2019 friends rallied with support in the post\u2019s comments section. \u201cMaybe if they spent less time on FB stalking you,\u201d one wrote, \u201cthey could work more, make more money and go on a vacation, too.\u201dIn certain rare instances, too many vacation photos are not enough. Dr. Vannucci said that after one of his clients had his wedding canceled at the last minute, he \u201cwas really struggling.\u201d He posted that it was called off but that he was still going to \u201cenjoy the honeymoon.\u201d On came a cavalcade of photos of one man\u2019s painful efforts at readjustment, all of them captioned, Dr. Vannucci said, \u201cwith funny, raw but heartbreaking comments.\u201d One groom\u2019s Stations of the Cross.Conscious that my own trickle of humble-braggy, emotionally stifled summertime photos on Facebook is its own version of fahvolousness, I spent a recent trip to Spain second-guessing myself. While, yes, I did share a picture of an outpost of the restaurant chain Museo del Jamon, I did not post a slew of others.Not the stylish dog walker and her dachshund that I intended to caption \u201cTiny pants, tiny dog: Madrid.\u201d Not the gorgeous honeycomb-like ceilings of the Alhambra. Not the 12-hour trip home when my boyfriend clutched his half-inflated neck pillow to his chest and referred to it as \u201ccomfort bosoms.\u201dBut am I being immodest when I tell you that I now see these omissions as a disservice to my friends and colleagues, who may have loved them.I am trying to calibrate my photographic output. As we all should.In the meantime, let us all delicately start a conversation about one of this topic\u2019s thorniest issues.

{"Headline": "How Parents Harnessed the Power of Social Media to Challenge EpiPen Prices", "Date": "2016-08-25", "News": "After Mellini Kantayya, an actress who lives in Brooklyn, chatted with her Facebook friends in July about the high cost of EpiPens, she knew she had to do something.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt just felt nefarious,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ms. Kantayya, whose health insurance covers the cost of EpiPens for her husband, who has an allergic condition. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not paying for it, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still paying for it in terms of social cost,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. Then she thought, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I do a petition, and maybe something will be done about this.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009dThen Ms. Kantayya shared the link with her 836 Facebook friends, with a post that began, \u00e2\u0080\u009cStupid pharmaceutical company!\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhat happened next is a lesson in the power of social media to help create a groundswell, particularly among a group as committed and motivated as the parents of children with food allergies, who must often buy multiple pens for home, school and day care. In just 45 days, Ms. Kantayya\u00e2\u0080\u0099s petition grew from a few dozen signatures to more than 80,000 people who sent more than 121,000 letters to Congress.So how did the EpiPen come to epitomize unfair drug pricing? While the price of the EpiPen did not increase overnight, data show that Mylan had been steadily increasing prices, first by about 10 percent, twice a year, but more recently in about 15 percent increments. This summer, as parents bought EpiPens for summer camp and back to school, many were paying higher out-of-pocket costs because of high deductibles and co-payments imposed by their insurance companies.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think Mylan just pushed it too far,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Robyn O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien of Boulder, Colo., a well-known parent activist and writer with a strong social media following. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt hit a price point for this year for back to school where parents absolutely revolted.\u00e2\u0080\u009dOne of them was Jennifer Vallez, an illustrator in Ellington, Conn., whose 9-year-old daughter, Lola, has a peanut and tree nut allergy. Because her insurance policy has a $2,000 deductible, her pharmacist told her the cost to refill an EpiPen prescription would be $600.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just morally so wrong,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ms. Vallez, a high school friend of Ms. Kantayya and the second person to sign the petition. She also shared it with her 533 Facebook friends. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have a lot of friends with children with allergies, so we all are pretty adamant about this kind of stuff and support each other,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.A week later, Georgina Cornago Cipriano, whose son Giovanni died at age 14 as a result of a food allergy, posted an article on Ms. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website about Mylan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cEpiPen profiteering.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow can they not care?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat can we do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Her post was shared 477 times, reaching more than 110,000 people.Ms. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien continued to press the issue online, as parents began posting receipts showing how much they were paying for EpiPens. One photo showed a Costco pharmacy receipt from Chandler, Ariz., for $1,698.28 that a parent had paid for three boxes of EpiPens, six pens total. A single mother from New Hampshire had a receipt for $925 for a two-pack of EpiPens.And then Ms. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien coined the hashtag #EpiGate, and it stuck. More media outlets began to cover the price increase.Ms. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien linked to the petition again, resulting in 972 shares. Signatures soon climbed to 53,000.What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so unusual about the pricing furor is that it has been orchestrated almost solely by parents and family members of people who use EpiPens. Patient advocacy groups, which typically are vocal on all issues related to food allergies, have been largely silent.Since 2011, Mylan says, it has provided more than $10 million in funding for \u00e2\u0080\u009ceducational efforts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d such as sponsorships and grants, and has received corporate citizen awards from FARE and the Allergy & Asthma Network.While the groups have not taken a prominent public stand on the issue, all three say they have been working behind the scenes with Mylan to expand its assistance program to help families obtain EpiPens at a lower out-of-pocket cost.Tonya Winders, president and chief executive of the Allergy & Asthma Network, said she began meeting with Mylan officials in March to talk about pricing issues. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gone all the way to the C.E.O. of Mylan with the conversation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.Dr. Cary Sennett, the chief executive of AAFA, said the group met with Mylan earlier this week. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey know our concerns about pricing and affordability,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

Having broken his own world record in the snatch last week at 216 kilograms, or some 475 pounds, Salimikordasiabi, who also goes by the name Salimi, was on track for another Olympic medal.But in the final clean and jerk competition \u2014 when he lifted 245 kilograms, or 540 pounds \u2014 the competition jury overruled a decision by referees, deciding that one of his arms had not been straight and that he had not demonstrated control.Salimikordasiabi\u2019s chance at a medal was gone. And Iranian fans erupted, pointing out, among other things, that one of the five judges on the jury came from Iraq, Iran\u2019s neighbor and political enemy.Athletes from Georgia and Armenia took gold, silver and bronze in the event.A spokeswoman for the federation did not immediately reply to a request for comment Monday as to what kind of investigation was proceeding and if disciplinary sanctions against any organization were being explored.Salimikordasiabi has stirred controversy within Iran in past years, too. He was left off the Iranian national team for the 2013 world championships after he engaged in a heated debate on television with Iran\u2019s weight lifting coach, calling him abusive.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "FOIA, Subpoenas and Singapore\u2019s Libel Laws: All in a Day\u2019s Work", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "Supported byIt\u2019s 5 a.m. and the first question on my mind is not \u201cWhat am I doing up?\u201d but \u201cWhat are we saying today about Singapore?\u201d As with most things in life, the answer lies in my iPhone.It\u2019s a daily ritual: checking my email before dawn to see whether I need to do a legal review of any stories heading toward deadline at our newsroom in Hong Kong. Singapore, with its strict libel laws, is always a concern. Among the many things they don\u2019t teach you in law school is how to make keen judgments on matters of foreign law while half-awake, half a world away. Somehow it works out, and especially today: None of our editors in Asia is looking for me.But in my inbox is a message from a reporter in the United States. He\u2019s been told he might be subpoenaed in a high-profile criminal case. At this stage, it\u2019s all just talk; much too soon to worry. For all the attention that big-time subpoenas get, 14 years at The Times has taught me that most of them go away with barely a whimper. Defendants take a plea, litigants settle, lawyers change their minds, or, more often than not, our strategy of throwing up every objection we can think of makes the whole thing more bother than it\u2019s worth.Most people think my day is mainly spent reading stories for legal risks. That\u2019s not so, but it is an important part of the job. And when you work for a digital publisher that updates the web constantly, you end up vetting articles at dinner, on the subway and in the middle of movies. I was once shown on the video scoreboard at Yankee Stadium working on a story on my cellphone.Libel suits are rare \u2014 our only active case was just dismissed by a judge in New Orleans \u2014 but a steady stream of complaint letters find their way to my desk and need to be dealt with. Some are rants, some are detailed and well-researched lawyer letters. And then there is the person who claims to have uncovered a secret code in a Tweet posted by a Times columnist.In recent years, I have spent increasing amounts of time waging legal battles against secrecy, seeking to open court files or get documents for our reporters through the Freedom of Information Act. We sue \u2014 a lot. And we\u2019re pretty much alone. The last time we checked the statistics, The Times had filed 14 federal FOIA suits over a two-year period; our peers in the mainstream media had filed a total of six altogether.Today\u2019s task is to write a brief for a case we have against the C.I.A. Our reporters are seeking the release of three classified documents about the old chemical warheads that were found in Iraq after the fall of Saddam Hussein.It\u2019s a bizarre dance, litigating with the C.I.A. The agency says it can neither confirm nor deny that the documents even exist \u2014 despite our asking for them by name and date. I write my brief as if there is no question that the documents exist; the C.I.A. writes its briefs as if it has no idea what I am talking about.Few in-house lawyers actually litigate cases, but I never wanted to be the stereotypical in-house counsel: a lawyer who calls lawyers. So I take on as many cases as I can. I am probably the only lawyer in New York who has argued cases this year before both the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and the Small Claims Court of the City of New York. (I won at the Second Circuit. As for small claims: Never tangle with an angry Times subscriber who says she didn\u2019t get her paper.)As always, my brief gets written in fits and starts. The emails and the phone calls keep coming. A reporter in Washington wants to know whether we can sue the federal government to get some Guant\u00e1namo documents. (We can, and we do.) An editor in New York is concerned about calling someone a \u201ccrony\u201d in a story. (We can live with that.) Someone else wants me to look at an article that recounts a series of unsuccessful business deals. (All is good.)At that point I started working with our editors and with Tug to improve our system for international security. We\u2019ve gotten pretty good at it. But the challenges are constant \u2014 whether it\u2019s the anti-press fury in Turkey, the deteriorating safety conditions in Afghanistan or a possible relocation of our Baghdad bureau.The day rolls on, a mosaic of moving and disjointed pieces: meeting with our marketing department to discuss state consumer protection laws, editing an article I\u2019m writing for a libel conference, reviewing an insurance policy, dealing with an endless dispute over a distribution contract, answering a question about using Facebook photos in the paper. Then there is the sit-down with reporters who are frustrated with a new round of stonewalling by officials in Albany. (Yes, some things about my job have not changed in 14 years.)By day\u2019s end, I realize I have managed to get only one real break from work \u2014 for a dental appointment. When I get there, the dentist takes me aside. He wants to know what reporters are saying about Trump behind the scenes. So much for escaping The Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "MTV Classic Is Nostalgia for Millennials. But Do They Want TV?", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "Supported byVH1 Classic is dead. This month, it was reborn as MTV Classic, a channel focusing on music videos and shows from the \u201980s to the aughts. The nostalgia baton has officially been passed to the millennials.In its first week, MTV Classic served up Mariah Carey in a butterfly necklace, TLC in silk pajamas and Gwen Stefani with a bindi. It broadcast reruns of \u201cBeavis and Butt-Head,\u201d \u201cDaria,\u201d Ashton Kutcher-era \u201cPunk\u2019d\u201d and a retrospective on \u201cTotal Request Live.\u201d Welcome to the BuzzFeed-ification of MTV \u2014 the music channel\u2019s attempt to reel in youngish viewers by appealing to their sentimentality for the recent past.As a millennial elder, I am MTV Classic\u2019s target demographic. I saw \u201cBeavis and Butt-Head Do America\u201d in theaters. Daria was my high school antiheroine. In my day, if you wanted to watch the new Limp Bizkit video, you had to wait for Carson Daly to debut it on \u201cTRL.\u201dJust a decade or two later, I\u2019m ready to reminisce about Lisa Frank folders and Puff Daddy videos. It makes sense that millennials, the most recorded generation in history, would romanticize the era just before smartphones became ubiquitous. We\u2019re fascinated by documents of life before everything was documented.MTV Classic offers that stuff 24/7. In the morning, music video blocks are stocked with Super Soakers, scrunchies and velour separates. Evenings bring reruns of shows like \u201cJackass\u201d and \u201cClone High.\u201d There\u2019s also fodder for the slightly older crowd: \u201cHeadbangers,\u201d a hostless version of the old \u201cHeadbangers Ball,\u201d delivers David Lee Roth prancing in a m\u00e9lange of sparkly bodysuits, and Megadeth burning the Constitution. The video marathon \u201cI Want My \u201980s\u201d features George Michael playacting as straight, on a yacht.Too bad it\u2019s all on TV. Millennials may pine for the television of the past, but that doesn\u2019t mean that we want to watch it on a television. Our pre-internet nostalgia is a sentiment largely expressed online. We binge \u201cFriends\u201d on Netflix, collect Pok\u00e9mon on our phones and scroll through evidence of resurrected \u201990s trends (Gigi Hadid in a velvet choker, Kylie Jenner\u2019s taupe lips) on Instagram.As a kid, I watched MTV in my older brother\u2019s bedroom, door slammed shut, hissing, \u201cI am Cornholio!\u201d back at the fuzzy old TV. But now culture is consumed on laptops and phones, while parents are watching prestige dramas on the living room flat screen.Die-hard fans might opt to DVR \u201cWonder Showzen\u201d and \u201cDaria\u201d instead of paying to watch them on iTunes or Hulu, but for the most part, the channel\u2019s \u201990s ear worms and throwback fashions are best packaged as linkable conversation starters, not cable video blocks. Post-YouTube, the experience of even watching an entire music video all the way through \u2014 much less 30 in a row, cut up by commercials \u2014 feels interminable. I kept wanting to X out the Nelly video and call up a Missy Elliott track. I did it on YouTube instead.Meanwhile, plenty of pop culture embedded in early MTV has not aged so well. While many of the music videos called up from the \u201990s and aughts feature artists of color, the channel\u2019s nonmusical programming is not so diverse. MTV Classic is a reminder that the MTV of my childhood starred white people: Carson Daly, Mr. Kutcher, Johnny Knoxville, Butt-Head, Beavis, the cast of \u201cLaguna Beach.\u201d Notable exceptions include MTV Classic\u2019s resurrection of the Run-DMC reality series \u201cRun\u2019s House,\u201d and \u201cPimp My Ride,\u201d hosted by Xzibit.In 2016, MTV stars look like Nick Cannon of \u201cWild \u2019N Out,\u201d DeRay Davis of \u201cJoking Off,\u201d Franchesca Ramsey of the web series \u201cDecoded\u201d and Nicole Byer of the forthcoming sitcom \u201cLoosely Exactly Nicole.\u201dYes, in order to be shareable, nostalgic content needs to exist online, but it should also nod to present-day social values. Ten years out, Ashton Kutcher in a trucker hat doesn\u2019t feel retro. It just looks pass\u00e9.Advertisement"}

Please.As one walks down the sidewalks in residential areas, shaded by mature trees and basking in the city\u2019s sunny, mild weather, it\u2019s not too hard to understand why homeowners are trying to keep Palo Alto small despite its reputation for giving birth to the world\u2019s next big thing.But as symbols go, it\u2019s hard to beat the paradox of bad cellphone reception in the cradle of cutting-edge technology.Brian Reid, a computer scientist and Palo Alto resident, blames \u201can unbelievable, fanatical fear of cell towers\u201d among Palo Alto residents for the somewhat spotty coverage, and he said heavy data usage compounded the problem.Mr. Reid, who lives four doors from the house of Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple who died in 2011, remembers the irony in 2007, a time of even worse cellphone coverage, when the iPhone was being introduced.

{"Headline": "Shocker! Facebook Changes Its Algorithm to Avoid \u2018Clickbait\u2019", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "Supported byFacebook says it plans to marginalize what it considers to be \u201cclickbait\u201d news stories from publishers in its news feed, in another step to keep its 1.71 billion members regularly coming back to its social network.\u201cWe want publishers to post content that people care about, and we think people care about headlines that are much more straightforward,\u201d Adam Mosseri, Facebook\u2019s vice president for product management for the news feed, said in an interview.Thursday\u2019s announcement goes a step further. Facebook spent months classifying phrases commonly used in clickbait headlines. Mr. Mosseri offered examples like \u201cThe Dog Barked at the Deliveryman and His Reaction Was Priceless,\u201d or \u201cWhen She Looked Under Her Couch Cushions and Saw THIS \u2026 I Was SHOCKED!\u201dThe company\u2019s algorithms then took note of the websites from which the articles were coming, and could detect patterns of traffic coming from those sites over time. That process was then automated, and content identified as clickbait will now appear lower in the news feed than before. Mr. Mosseri likened the practice to a kind of email spam filtering process.The move will most likely heighten the anxiety of publishers that rely heavily on Facebook for traffic and often complain about having little insight into the company\u2019s decision-making on how its all-powerful algorithm functions.The social network\u2019s vast user base and sophisticated targeting capabilities allow publishers to reach new audiences far beyond the direct traffic a media company receives at its own site. As a result, Facebook has been able to largely dictate the terms on which it engages with publishers, which have few other options for distributing their articles.Julie Hansen, the president and chief operating officer of the online publication Business Insider, said it would take Facebook\u2019s latest algorithm change under consideration.\u201cWe don\u2019t do what we consider to be clickbaity headlines,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we\u2019ll certainly consider Facebook\u2019s guidance when we look to post our content onto Facebook and adapt the headlines if needed.\u201dFacebook said that publishers that have clickbaitlike headlines and are ranked lower because of the algorithm change will have the opportunity to change their ways and rise again in the rankings.Some publishers are now betting on a future beyond total reliance on Facebook, as companies like Snapchat and Google offer media companies other avenues to distribute their work.\u201cToday we\u2019re at peak Facebook \u2014 Facebook dominates everything,\u201d said Zachary Kaplan, a vice president at the investment firm General Atlantic, which has invested in digital media companies like BuzzFeed and Vox Media.\u201cWe will naturally evolve to a place where there will be more competition among digital distributors,\u201d he said, \u201cand that would result in, naturally, more leverage for publishers.\u201dFor now, Facebook said it planned to improve relationships with publishers by becoming more transparent about its news feed practices. Mr. Mosseri regularly meets with publishers to discuss algorithm changes.\u201cIt\u2019s becoming clear to us how there\u2019s a lot of anxiety over what we do,\u201d Mr. Mosseri said. \u201cI spend a lot of time trying to ease that anxiety.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Verizon\u2019s systems apparently were screening the text messages as spam, said Kevin King, a company spokesman, but that problem has been fixed.The website, however, noted on Wednesday that heavy traffic might cause problems with the receipt or entry of text codes and advised users, \u201cPlease check back in a few days.\u201dThe mySocialSecurity website, introduced in 2012, allows people who receive Social Security benefits to obtain verification letters, order replacement Social Security or Medicare cards and set up or change direct deposit of payments. Those who do not yet receive benefits can obtain estimates of future payments and check their annual earnings statement to make sure that their benefit payments are calculated using the correct information.Here are some questions and answers about the new Social Security log on system:Users enter their user name and password as usual, but they are also asked to enter an eight-digit code texted to their cellphone each time they log on to the website. A texted code is now also required for people who are establishing accounts for the first time. The codes are valid for 10 minutes and can be used just once.If you get a new phone but keep the same phone number, you do not have to do anything, according to the administration\u2019s website. If you lose your cellphone, you can request a cellphone reset code online, and the agency will mail you a letter with a reset code in five to 10 business days.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Calvin Klein Names Its First Chief Creative Officer", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "Supported byOn the RunwayThough widely expected by the fashion world since Mr. Simons resigned as creative director at Dior in October, the appointment heralds a major strategy shift at Calvin Klein, which is owned by PVH.The move may also be a riposte of sorts to those who seized on Mr. Simons\u2019s departure from Dior of France as a chance to deplore the state of fashion for demanding too much of designers. The need to do six Dior collections a year was seen as a millstone around the neck of creativity.Though this transferred power from the designers to the brand, and Calvin Klein remained a commercial force, its aesthetic identity and influence were greatly diminished.Most attempts to make a statement, like a recent ad campaign featuring Justin Bieber and Kendall Jenner, were more a retread of old ideas (Marky Mark and Kate Moss) than a contemporary vision.Mr. Simons will \u201coversee all aspects of design, global marketing and communications, and visual creative services,\u201d the company said. And his long-term collaborator, Pieter Mulier, was named Calvin Klein\u2019s creative director.A fashion world favorite and trained industrial designer who in 1995 started a men\u2019s wear line that bears his name, Mr. Simons began his career in women\u2019s wear as creative director of Jil Sander. He moved quickly to put his own modernist stamp on that brand, before joining Dior and doing the same in 2012. He is known for an intellectual, architectural approach to form.His appointment at Calvin Klein is an acknowledgment of the need for a defining, and unifying, creative point of view for a brand, no matter how large. In a time of geopolitical unrest and challenged consumption patterns, a line must stand for something to stand out. That will be Mr. Simons\u2019s charge.If he can achieve it, he will help refocus New York fashion, which has been in something of a creative vacuum in recent years, casting about for a post-sportswear identity.It is an enormous opportunity, and an enormous challenge. Not the kind of challenge that a designer who is searching for more time to smell the daisies would take on \u2014 especially given the fact that Mr. Simons, who has relocated to New York from Antwerp, Belgium, will continue to design his own men\u2019s line at the same time.The fact that Mr. Simons has stepped in to this role at Calvin Klein suggests that perhaps his departure from Dior had more to do with the limitations he found in that job (his responsibility was limited to women\u2019s wear and accessories) than with any design pressure. And that it is not the creative demands the fashion industry places on its designers that is creating unrest in the industry, but rather the continuing power struggle between brand and individual.The first test will come next year, when Mr. Simons presents his men\u2019s and women\u2019s fall collections for Calvin Klein.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why It\u2019s Not Enough Just to Be Disruptive", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "Supported byAnother ViewThe unanimous takeaway has been that incumbents everywhere are poised to get their clocks cleaned by a stampede of disruptive insurgents \u2014 unless they buy them first.This analysis, however, misdiagnoses recent transactions as a series of new-versus-old shootouts.To be sure, the web has been grinding down barriers to entry for 20 years, reducing the advantages of incumbents. For new entrants, this flatter playing field creates opportunity. But since the key tools at their disposal are universally available \u2014 including to companies like Facebook and Google, with enormous scale advantages \u2014 this only helps them get into the game, not capture any value lost by legacy firms. Short-term success may be driven by exceptional execution; long-term value creation requires building a defensible model.Any microeconomics textbook will tell you there are limited sources of competitive advantage. The most valuable companies combine several reinforcing strands, like scale and customer loyalty. Gillette has long been, literally, a textbook example.In 1996, Warren E. Buffett, then the largest shareholder in Gillette, commented: \u201cYou go to bed feeling very comfortable just thinking about two and a half billion males with hair growing while you sleep. No one at Gillette has trouble sleeping.\u201dBut 20 years later, management at Gillette (long since acquired by Procter & Gamble) is probably tossing and turning a little more. Gillette\u2019s scale still provides formidable advantages (wide retail distribution, superior patented technology through large R.&D. investment), and its well-known brand (reinforced through mass-media advertising) creates a strong habit in loyal customers acquired early in their lives.However, those advantages are plainly no longer as formidable as they were at the company\u2019s zenith. For an insurgent like Dollar Shave Club, online sales reduce the impact of Gillette\u2019s big lead in drugstore shelf space, and cloud-computing services reduce the required upfront technology investment. Targeted direct marketing on Facebook and other social channels obviates the need for a mass-media campaign, while customer reviews and word-of-mouth can spread the word. At the high end, Gillette\u2019s patented, multi-blade, vibrating razor is a tough opponent, so naturally new entrants focus on the entry level \u2014 where they can rebrand cheap, no-name blades to compete.In Jet\u2019s case, the serial entrepreneur Marc Lore was able to build a large e-commerce company for a few hundred million dollars in just a couple of years by taking an innovative approach to pricing and distribution. And Walmart is plainly convinced that Jet\u2019s expertise and momentum will help it compete with Amazon. Jet\u2019s negative gross margins, which would have required large continuing investments, will disappear when combined with Walmart\u2019s purchasing and distribution scale.While it is hard to stay ahead solely through superior execution over an extended period, it is sometimes enough in the short term to draw a deep-pocketed buyer where there are strong, immediate synergies. Creating enormous value over the long term requires turning a tactical edge into some form of durable advantage.While there are plenty of extraordinary start-ups creating new markets with a path to genuine advantage, self-described \u201cdisrupters\u201d often find that the same forces that allowed them to get going initially also let in a horde of rivals. Competition drains away profit.This is particularly likely where the \u201cdisruptive innovation\u201d does not greatly change the cost structure or end-user experience. Putting a thin layer of software on a people-intensive service business, for instance, may win some immediate sales against Luddite competitors, but it is not necessarily sustainable, nor will it conjure up fat margins. New and existing competitors can often spiff up their supporting tech, too.As the Columbia Business School Professor Bruce C. Greenwald pointed out in his book \u201cCompetition Demystified,\u201d product differentiation on its own is not the basis for sustainable advantage. In his renowned example, \u201calmost everybody makes toasters\u201d \u2014 and if consumers one day demanded \u201ctoasters that sing when the bread is ready\u201d \u2014 soon every manufacturer would offer a \u201ccrooning toaster.\u201dThe rise of web-fueled competition is plainly inexorable. Computers are infinitely patient and accurate in comparing prices and opportunities, and now companies can provide a complete set of services to atomize the fixed costs formerly required for market entry.However, despite the threat to profits, there is no cause for gloom. Superior tactical execution can still create real value, particularly where it provides ammunition for a bigger war (like Walmart\u2019s battle with Amazon). And in the long term, value is created not by disruption, but by weaving together advantages (as both Amazon and Walmart have done in different ways) that together create a barrier that is hard to storm.Jeremy G. Philips is a general partner at Spark Capital and an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School.Advertisement"}

Asked how many people he thought were still trapped or dead underneath debris, he said, \u201cmany, many.\u201dHe added that Amatrice had been cut off because of damage to roads and a bridge, and he appealed during a live television broadcast for assistance.Ambulances raced back and forth on one of the main roads to Amatrice, where a courtyard in a still-standing palazzo had been turned into an impromptu morgue.CNN showed footage of construction equipment being used to try to comb through giant pieces of debris in Amatrice and of rescuers standing on huge piles of rubble where homes once stood, evidence of the enormous scale of the rescue effort.\u201cWe need chain saws, shears to cut iron bars and jacks to remove beams,\u201d a civil protection worker, Andrea Gentili, told The Associated Press. \u201cEverything, we need everything.\u201dA look at earthquakes in Italy that have caused extensive damage over the last century.The paths of destruction led to other places, including the Tyrrhenian coast. A witness in Sperlonga, a popular seaside town in Lazio, said that the historic city center had been seriously damaged, and news channels showed photographs of crumbled buildings and rubble-covered cars.The earthquake was felt from Rome to Bologna, in Emilia-Romagna, in a broad area pockmarked with dozens of small towns. Italian officials said it was difficult to gauge the number of casualties or the damage as the ground kept trembling through the night.Fabrizio Curcio, the director of the Civil Protection Department, said that the earthquake had been severe and that national emergency procedures had been activated.Mr. Curcio said mayors in the affected areas were monitoring the damage to their areas.\u201cThey know the territory best,\u201d he said.By early morning, rescue operations had been able to reach the most damaged towns, he said, adding, \u201cWe have to carry out an analysis of the territory and see if there are other places that have to be reached.\u201dOn social media, there were many reports of friends or relatives being buried or trapped, and local residents said that the rescue effort was hindered by the fact that rescue teams were having difficulty getting to the mountainous area, where most towns are reachable only along winding country roads.In Norcia, dozens of residents wrapped in blankets greeted the dawn in the town\u2019s main square. \u201cMuch of our patrimony is damaged, but there are no victims,\u201d Mayor Nicola Alemanno told RaiNews24. \u201cThat is the good news.\u201dThe National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology reported that there had been nearly a dozen other earthquakes in the affected area over the course of about two hours. None was as strong as the 6.2 quake.Katherine Selby, who is from Nottingham, England, was vacationing with her family in Campagnano di Roma, just outside Rome, when the wardrobe doors began \u201cshaking like crazy,\u201d she wrote on Twitter.It was frightening because it was unclear what was going on, she said, adding that she was anxiously waiting for the next aftershock.She said there was no damage.The United States Geological Survey said the people in the region lived in structures that were a \u201cmix of vulnerable and earthquake-resistant construction.\u201dElisabetta Povoledo reported from Rome, and Christopher Mele from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazil\u2019s Uplifting Olympics", "Date": "2016-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen I was a correspondent in Brazil 30 years ago, inflation was rampant. It ran at an average of 707.4 percent a year from 1985 to 1989. The salaries of the poor were wiped out within hours of being paid. The country went through three currencies \u2014 cruzeiro, cruzado and cruzado novo \u2014 while I lived in Rio. The only way out for Brazilians, people joked, was Gale\u00e3o, the international airport.Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim, the composer of \u201cThe Girl From Ipanema\u201d (and whose name is now affixed to that airport), famously observed that \u201cBrazil is not for beginners.\u201dIt was not then and it\u2019s not now. It\u2019s a vast diverse country, a tropical United States, whose rich and poor are divided by a chasm. High crime rates are in part a reflection of this divide. Flexibility is at a premium in a culture fashioned by heat, sensuality, samba and rule bending. Life can be cheap. You adapt or you perish.Edmar Bacha, a friend and economist, had coined the term \u201cBelindia\u201d to describe Brazil \u2014 a prosperous Belgium perched atop a teeming India. I wrote a story about the poor kids from north Rio, far from the beaches of Ipanema and Leblon, who would get their kicks as \u201ctrain surfers,\u201d riding the tops of fast-moving trains, rather than surf Atlantic waves. Often they died, electrocuted. I will never forget the twisted corpse of one in the city morgue.Inequity was part of the story, yet even in those tumultuous times it was not all of it. \u201cTudo bem?\u201d \u2014 \u201cAll good?\u201d \u2014 I would ask when I ventured into the ubiquitous favelas, or slums. \u201cTudo bem!\u201d was often the response, along with a smile, even when all was entirely awful. Penury in the sun is not penury in the cold.I once asked the S\u00e3o Paulo industrialist Jos\u00e9 Mindlin if he was worried about where Brazil was headed. \u201cI always worry about the end of the month,\u201d Mindlin said. \u201cBut I never worry about the future.\u201d He was right. Brazil is the graveyard of naysayers.According to the World Bank, life expectancy increased to 74.4 years in 2014 from 63.9 in 1986 (in the same period American life expectancy went up by just four years). Illiteracy is still too high but has fallen sharply.Brazil today is less Belindia than Franconesia \u2014 a substantial France atop an Indonesia. Its problems persist, but only a fool would deny that Brazil will be a major 21st-century player. As anyone attending the Olympics must feel, Brazil has a powerful and joyous national culture. It is the land of \u201cTudo bem.\u201dAll of which is to say that I am tired, very tired, of reading negative stories about these Brazilian Olympics \u2014 the anger in the slums, the violence that continues (including the armed robbery of four American swimmers), the enduring gulf between rich and poor, the occasional organizational hassles, the Russian doping and the Brazilian mosquito, money that could supposedly have been spent better than extending the Metro that now runs from the center to prosperous Barra da Tijuca (so, among other things, enabling the poor to get jobs out there).First, Brazil was never going to get the job done in time for the Olympics; now that it\u2019s shown so much success and held a magnificent opening ceremony, it\u2019s blamed for not having resolved every one of its social problems in time for the Games.There is something in the developed world that does not like a developing country that organizes a major sporting event. I heard the same jeremiads in South Africa at the time of the World Cup in 2010: the crime that would ruin things, the poverty that was shameful and the inefficiency that would plague visitors. The tournament was a triumph. I don\u2019t recall reporters combing the poorest, most crime-ridden parts of Britain in 2012 to find people ready to grumble about the London Olympics.These Olympics are good for Brazil and good for humanity, a needed tonic. Watch Usain Bolt or Simone Biles and feel uplifted.Out in the favelas some kids are dreaming in a different way right now. That, too, is a story.David Brooks is off today.Advertisement"}

Dual citizens are in a privileged position of being able to judge certain things as \u201cbetter\u201d in one country than the other. Yet such comparisons are often folly.It\u2019s admirable that countries like Finland, Norway and the Netherlands exhibit more social solidarity across the political spectrum than the United States. But to a large degree this is a function of the Nordic and Dutch models having a much stronger central government. The American political structure grants far more authority to state and local governments with hugely varied preferences.Additionally, given its population size, heterogeneity and rather fragmented social fabric, it\u2019s unsurprising that the United States isn\u2019t like Finland. It\u2019s important to appreciate differences, and not to patronize by suggesting how foolish we Americans are not to adopt a different social model.

Surrounded by a harsh, dry desert, the city has been ruled alternately by Chinese, Mongol, Turkic and Tibetan powers.In the 21st century, the region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mostly-Muslim Uighur population has chafed under Chinese control, leading to protests and violent attacks as well as government crackdowns on ethnic and religious expression. After Uighur uprisings in 2009, the Chinese government tried to quell unrest through economic revitalization.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s undeniable that the programs have developed the level of modernization in Xinjiang, such as infrastructure construction, hospitals and schools, Mr. Liu said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut there are not many opportunities for local Uighurs.\u00e2\u0080\u009dKashgar, at first, seemed like a foreign country to Mr. Liu \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with its vastly different language, customs, religion and even weather. But familiar propaganda slogans on buildings and a giant statue of Mao Zedong in the center of the city made it seem like his home province of Sichuan. He found the people he met to be quite welcoming, to a point.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Uighurs are friendly and less defensive than the Han,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut they hesitated to talk deeply about religious and political issues at first.\u00e2\u0080\u009dEventually he befriended some younger Uighurs who, he found, rarely went to mosque. Most of the people he met felt a strong Uighur identity.As part of the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s regional development plan, young Uighurs were encouraged to work in factories in eastern China. Besides boosting industrial production, the aim, Mr. Liu said, was to expose them to the broader Chinese society. For the Uighurs, it offered a welcome economic opportunity.Mr. Liu had previously documented young Uighurs working through government programs in a factory in the city of Guangzhou in southeastern China. He decided to follow a new group as they embarked from Kashgar on a journey of more than 3,700 miles to Guangzhou.Many of the young workers grew homesick and sang Uighur songs in the company-provided dormitories. Others saw the year-long experience as an adventure, he said. Over the course of many visits, he photographed them at work and at play, although they tended to keep to themselves outside of the factory.Many have returned home with money saved. One couple he followed parlayed their nest-egg into a mobile fruit store, but there does not seem to be much economic opportunity for Uighurs despite the government development push. Nor have these programs led to more satisfaction among the Uighur population, Mr. Liu said.After more than a year of working on stories about the Uighurs, Mr. Liu said, he realized that he still sees no clear solution to their predicament.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Chinese government is trying to solve this problem by economic ways,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the Uighur people care as much about their culture, their lifestyle and their religion than money.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

{"Headline": "Wrongfully Convicted of Rape, a New Jersey Man Finds More Punishment After Prison", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byExonerations of wrongfully convicted people have become so routine in recent years that their stories are almost commonplace. We think we know the narrative: A defendant languishes in prison for a crime he did not commit; through tenacious legal work \u2014 or the magic of DNA tests \u2014 he is freed.Then there are stories like Dion Harrell\u2019s, which show that the suffering attached to unjust verdicts can linger even after the innocent are sprung from their prison cells.Nearly 30 years ago, at 22, Mr. Harrell was arrested on suspicion of raping a teenage girl and later served four years in a New Jersey prison. But when he was released on parole, what amounted to his second sentence started: For the next two decades, he had to live with the restrictions of the state\u2019s sex-offender statute, known as Megan\u2019s Law.On Wednesday, Mr. Harrell, now 50, is to be formally cleared of the rape charge in State Superior Court in Freehold, N.J., officially foreclosing his legal tribulations. But he said that even an exoneration, as welcome as it is, would not entirely end his ordeal.\u201cIt\u2019s never going to leave me,\u201d he said in an interview this week. \u201cI\u2019m scarred for life, no matter what.\u201dIn September 1988, Mr. Harrell was arrested in the rape of a 17-year-old girl as she was walking home from her job at a McDonald\u2019s in Long Branch, N.J. A neighborhood guy who often played basketball with local police detectives, Mr. Harrell lived across the street from the fast-food restaurant. When he was arrested, the victim immediately identified him as her assailant.\u201cThe cops were like, \u2018Why\u2019d you do it?\u2019\u201d Mr. Harrell said. \u201cI was like, \u2018Do what?\u2019 They said, \u2018Why\u2019d you rape her?\u2019 I just broke down crying. I still cry \u2014 it hurts.\u201dMr. Harrell was found guilty in 1992, and from 1993 to 1997, he was imprisoned at the Mid-State Correctional Facility at the Fort Dix Army base. When he was released, he was required under Megan\u2019s Law to be added to the state\u2019s sex-offender registry. The law, which was named for Megan Kanka, a 7-year-old girl who was raped and murdered near Trenton in 1994, precluded him from living near children. Though he wanted at first to move in with his sister, his sister had two sons, both of whom were minors at the time. So state agencies helped him find a hotel room, he said, where he lived for nearly a year.Meanwhile, his name and image were spread across the internet \u2014 not only on the state\u2019s website, but also on private pages that alert residents to sex offenders living in their area. He said he was spotted in \u2014 and hounded out of \u2014 bars. Friends, and friends of friends, posted insults on his Facebook page. Landlords did not want him in their buildings. Employers refused to hire him.\u201cHe served four years in prison,\u201d Ms. Potkin said, \u201cbut was in essence sentenced to decades of instability.\u201dWhile still in prison, Mr. Harrell had written to the Innocence Project asking for help in getting a DNA test that he hoped would clear his name. \u201cThe reason I am writing your office,\u201d his original letter read, \u201cis because I am innocent of the crime.\u201d He added that he \u201ccannot begin to explain\u201d the psychological trauma he had endured.At that point, however, the organization already had thousands of defendants on its waiting list. It was also difficult, Ms. Potkin said, to correspond with Mr. Harrell because of his transient living situation.Eventually, in 2014, she took the case. She faced an immediate hurdle: Under New Jersey law at the time, only defendants still in prison were entitled to a DNA test. (The law has since been amended.)It is hard to know precisely how many cases like Mr. Harrell\u2019s exist across the country. But one man who experienced a similar ordeal is Eddie Lowery, a former Army specialist, who in 1982 was wrongfully convicted of raping a 63-year-old woman as she lay sleeping in her home in Ogden, Kan. Mr. Lowery, who is now 57 and lives in California, served 10 years in prison. When he got out and had to register as a sex offender, he was so afraid of being recognized that he hid his house\u2019s address plate behind a flower pot.\u201cIt was almost like I was still in a prison on the outside,\u201d he said the other day. \u201cEven though I was out, I wasn\u2019t free.\u201dFor the moment, Mr. Harrell is living with a relative in Long Branch. He is still unemployed, but at least he can visit his sister again. He has been spending time with his two daughters, who are 25 and 27. Although he has not healed yet, he is looking forward to Wednesday when a judge will officially set him free.\u201cIt\u2019ll get me out of the hellhole,\u201d he said.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the year of the rape that Dion Harrell was convicted of. As the article correctly notes, it was in 1988, not 1992.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Uber Aims for an Edge in the Race for a Self-Driving Future", "Date": "2016-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA world in which cars drive themselves may come sooner than once thought.On Thursday, Uber said that it would begin testing self-driving cars in Pittsburgh in a matter of weeks, allowing people in the city to hail modified versions of Volvo sport utility vehicles to get around the city.Uber also said it had acquired Otto, a 90-person start-up including former Google and Carnegie Mellon engineers that is focused on developing self-driving truck technology to upend the shipping industry.Those moves are the most recent indications of Uber\u2019s ambitions for autonomous vehicles that can provide services to both consumers and businesses.Suddenly, it seems, both Silicon Valley and Detroit are doubling down on their bets for autonomous vehicles. And in what could emerge as a self-driving-car arms race, the players are investing in, or partnering with, or buying outright the specialty companies most focused on the requisite hardware, software and artificial intelligence capabilities.Despite their multitude of sensors and processors, autonomous cars have a lot of trouble with some everyday aspects of driving.\u201cIt appears 2016 will go down in history as the year of the autonomous vehicle partnership,\u201d said Karl Brauer, an analyst with the auto research firm Kelley Blue Book.But the Ford and Uber initiatives are not without risk. Federal auto safety regulators are preparing guidelines for autonomous vehicles that may or may not include the need for a steering wheel or require the presence of a driver who can step in should computerized systems falter.In a nod to the highly experimental nature of its Pittsburgh plan, Uber intends to have an actual human being behind the wheel \u2014 just in case. But while Ford is looking five years out, Uber is moving aggressively toward driverless fleets, despite the regulatory uncertainties.\u201cThere\u2019s an urgency to our mission about being part of the future,\u201d Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s chief executive, said on Thursday in an interview. \u201cThis is not a side project. This is existential for us.\u201dThat explains Uber\u2019s other announcement on Thursday \u2014 its deal to buy Otto for undisclosed terms, to beef up its own in-house expertise in self-driving technology.The acquisition of Otto follows Uber\u2019s recent opening of an advanced technology center in Pittsburgh, in conjunction with Carnegie Mellon University. The company has also hired engineers directly away from Google, which has been immersed in developing autonomous cars for a decade.Like Uber, Google is intent on developing self-driving cars for urban taxi use \u2014 reasoning that the slow speeds and relatively predictable environment of city streets that can be thoroughly, digitally mapped is the best and safest near-term purpose of autonomous vehicles. But for Uber, such cars are not a side bet but a way to be more fully in control of its business by eliminating the need for drivers who expect to be paid.\u201cUber arguably has more at stake in creating self-driving cars than any other automotive entity,\u201d Mr. Brauer said.Although the market for big sales of fully self-driving cars is still years away, the investment and research activities are on a fast track.Uber plans to open a 180,000-square-foot facility in Palo Alto, Calif., to house Otto, which will operate as a stand-alone company focused specifically on upending the long-distance trucking industry. Otto engineers will also work out of offices in San Francisco and Pittsburgh.But that talent and technology will apply more broadly to the technology behind Uber\u2019s grander self-driving car efforts, Mr. Kalanick said. He said he believed that his company\u2019s approach \u2014 a combination of teaming up with hardware manufacturers, Otto\u2019s software expertise and a large network of more than 50 million monthly riders as recently as July \u2014 places Uber in the best position to be competitive with companies like Google.\u201cThe first company in the space is not always the winner,\u201d Anthony Levandowski, chief executive of Otto, said on Thursday. \u201cIntel was not the first chip maker. Facebook wasn\u2019t the first social network.\u201dThe self-driving revolution has already hit a few speed bumps, in vehicles that are not fully autonomous but employ some elements of the technology. The electric-car maker Tesla is under investigation by federal regulators looking into a fatal crash in May of a Tesla Model S sedan whose driver had the vehicle\u2019s Autopilot assisted-driving system engaged.After Joshua Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio, was killed driving a Tesla Model S in the first fatality involving a self-driving car, questions have arisen about the safety of the car\u2019s technology.The German automaker Daimler was forced recently to pull an advertisement in the United States that possibly overstated the safety of assisted-driving options in a new Mercedes-Benz model.And Google is continuously explaining how minor accidents are occurring in self-driving vehicles it has been testing for some time in California.But potential safety concerns have hardly slowed the pace of research and investment by G.M., Ford and others. In Uber\u2019s case, Mr. Kalanick said he was confident that government officials would approve self-driving vehicles once the industry proves their effectiveness in real-world conditions.\u201cRegulators are going to optimistically make it work, while making it safer for the whole community,\u201d he said.In the Pittsburgh pilot program, Uber plans not only to have human drivers aboard as a safety precaution. Passengers who use the vehicles will have to \u201copt in\u201d and agree to be participants in the road test before riding, according to Uber.G.M. and Lyft are also planning their own testing program for autonomous ride-hailing vehicles, although they have not disclosed details.That plan, along with this week\u2019s announcements by Uber and Ford make clear that the initial market for robotic cars will likely be for commercial fleets rather than vehicles consumers would park in their own garages.Industry analysts see ride-hailing firms and delivery businesses as natural customers for the first autonomous vehicles, in part because the cars and trucks are expected to carry high price tags.Ford officials said this week that ride-hailing services are able to generate the passenger revenues needed to cover the high cost of the cars.Raj Nair, Ford\u2019s global product development chief, said that eliminating human drivers would drastically lower the cost of a ride-hailing fare. By catering to those companies, Ford expects to build a small, but profitable business segment.Ford has not said how many self-driving vehicles it expects to produce on an annual basis, or whether it would adapt one of its current models or build an entirely new vehicle.But the company\u2019s chief executive, Mark Fields, pledged that the vehicles would \u201cbring mobility to millions of people\u201d who do not own cars themselves. And doing so will create a \u201cvery good business\u201d for Ford.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Oracle, Having Bet Billions on Its Future, Sets Sights on Data Analysis", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsOracle Corporation may well be the single most important technology firm for businesses. Over 300,000 companies around the world use its database, and 100,000 customers have purchased its business applications. Even companies gunning for Oracle \u2014 like Amazon, Google and Salesforce \u2014 have used Oracle\u2019s technology.Besides selling applications more efficiently, he said, Oracle has pooled a large amount of information derived from over 1,500 data providers. \u201cMarketers and brands find this very powerful,\u201d he said in an email, as Oracle targets \u201cover 45,000 different dimensions (demographic, geography, online and offline behavior).\u201dIn other words, what Google and Facebook know based on your online life, as well as what companies learn from your shopping habits, credit and warranty behavior, among other things. Oracle will also have data on what customers do after an ad campaign, so advertisers can check the outcome of a Google ad blitz.The same data-heavy approach can be used in functions of business like procurement, human capital management, sales and service, Mr. Kurian thinks. \u201cWe know how payrolls change around job titles, the rate of salary changes in Silicon Valley versus Bangalore, or how many people in a company are buying a $10 printer cartridge,\u201d he told me in an earlier interview.This data analysis could become a valuable adjunct to many of Oracle\u2019s database and applications businesses. Equally, it drives home how the competition in cloud computing is moving from cost savings \u2014 Amazon Web Services started by selling cheap computing and storage \u2014 to value creation through better insight.In that business, large amounts of data are a critical asset \u2014 what Mr. Kurian termed \u201ctrying to be at the center of data gravity.\u201d Oracle definitely has a place there, perhaps a better one than any company.Other elements of success will most likely include reliability, ease of use and price. Oracle may be challenged there, precisely because it has built a big and complicated system of databases, bigger than anything Amazon, Microsoft or Google sells. It has to keep those older customers happy, even as it makes data easier to move around, in and out of the cloud, for different kinds of analysis.In that, Oracle has a powerful and little-noted asset: Despite its reputation as a hard-edge company, it has good engineers with decades of experience. Employees fly in and out of Google or Facebook, but they seem to stay longer, on average, at Oracle.That can be an advantage when it comes to working on complex projects. \u201cUnderstanding complex software takes a year,\u201d Mr. Kurian said. \u201cUnderstanding the intentions behind it, which you need if you\u2019re going to adapt it, takes even longer.\u201dSlow, steady and reliable may make people at the fast, young tech companies snicker.

{"Headline": "G.E., the 124-Year-Old Software Start-Up", "Date": "2016-08-27", "News": "Supported byIt may not qualify as a lightning-bolt eureka moment, but Jeffrey R. Immelt, chief executive of General Electric, recalls the June day in 2009 that got him thinking. He was speaking with G.E. scientists about new jet engines they were building, laden with sensors to generate a trove of data from every flight \u2014 but to what end?That data could someday be as valuable as the machinery itself, if not more so. But G.E. couldn\u2019t make use of it.But in 2011, G.E. also quietly opened a software center in San Ramon, Calif., 24 miles east of San Francisco, across the bay.Today one of San Ramon\u2019s most important projects is to build a computer operating system, but on an industrial scale \u2014 a Microsoft Windows or Google Android for factories and industrial equipment. The project is central to G.E.\u2019s drive to become what Mr. Immelt says will be a \u201ctop 10 software company\u201d by 2020.Silicon Valley veterans are skeptical.Many industries see digital threats, of course. Yet the scope of the challenge is magnified at G.E., a 124-year-old company and the nation\u2019s largest manufacturer, with more than 300,000 employees worldwide. Employees companywide have been making pilgrimages to San Ramon for technology briefings, but also to soak in the culture. Their marching orders are to try to adapt the digital wizardry and hurry-up habits of Silicon Valley to G.E.\u2019s world of industrial manufacturing.6 PhotosG.E.\u2019s success or failure over the next decade, Mr. Immelt says, depends on this transformation. He calls it \u201cprobably the most important thing I\u2019ve worked on in my career.\u201dApparently, there is no Plan B. \u201cIt\u2019s this or bust,\u201d he said.The march of digital technology \u2014 mainly inexpensive sensors, powerful computing and clever software \u2014 into the industrial world has been underway for years under the guise of \u201cthe internet of things\u201d or \u201cthe industrial internet.\u201d It is the next battlefield as companies fight to develop the dominant software layer that connects the machines.It promises to be a huge market for new products, improved service and efficiency gains in industries like energy, transportation and health care. By 2020, the industrial internet market will reach $225 billion, G.E. executives predicted in a recent meeting with analysts.So far, a major application has been predictive maintenance. Software analyzes the data generated by a machine to identify early warning signals that it needs repair, before it breaks down.The data volumes are exploding as machines new and old spawn sensors. By 2020, G.E. estimates that the data flowing off its machines in use will jump a hundredfold. That should enable far more detailed analysis, giving G.E. a chance to sell its customers not machines but \u201cbusiness outcomes,\u201d like fuel savings. Mr. Immelt sees this as a move up the industrial food chain.Yet all of this exposes G.E. to new competition beyond its traditional rivals like Rockwell Automation, Siemens and United Technologies. Tech giants, including Amazon, Cisco, Google, IBM and Microsoft also have their eye on the industrial internet market, as do a bevy of start-ups.There is precedent for trouble in other industries, of course. Google and Facebook transformed media and advertising, Amazon redefined retailing, and Uber applied an entirely new business model to taxis, which hadn\u2019t changed much in generations.\u201cThe real danger is that the data and analysis becomes worth more than the installed equipment itself,\u201d said Karim R. Lakhani, a professor at the Harvard Business School. \u201cG.E. has no choice but to try to do that itself.\u201dUntil this year, Darren Haas hadn\u2019t thought about G.E., certainly not working there. To him, G.E. meant little more than than kitchen appliances and light bulbs. \u201cI had no idea,\u201d Mr. Haas said.But he was intrigued after he met with Harel Kodesh, an expert in mobile and cloud computing who led teams at Microsoft and VMware, a maker of data-center software. Less than two years ago, Mr. Kodesh joined G.E., and he is now chief technology officer of GE Digital.That someone of Mr. Kodesh\u2019s caliber was a G.E. convert got Mr. Haas\u2019s attention. Then, Mr. Haas started grasping the role that G.E. equipment plays across the economy \u2014 in transportation, in hospitals \u2014 \u201ca whole world,\u201d he said. \u201cI found that really, really compelling.\u201dThe other thing Mr. Haas, 41, found appealing was the big computing challenge that lies ahead for the company. In May, he joined G.E. from Apple, where he was a member of the founding team at Siri, the voice-based digital assistant start-up Apple acquired in 2010. When he left Apple, Mr. Haas was head of cloud engineering, managing the computing engine behind Siri, iTunes and iCloud.At GE Digital, Mr. Haas has a similar title, head of platform cloud engineering, but in a different setting. He describes his job as applying modern software technology \u2014 machine learning, artificial intelligence and cloud computing \u2014 to the industrial arena. \u201cI\u2019ve got my work cut out for me,\u201d he said.Mr. Haas is working on the centerpiece of G.E.\u2019s software strategy, a product called Predix. Its evolution mirrors G.E.\u2019s software ambitions.Predix began as little more than a brand of software used by G.E. to service the gear it sells. One showcase use was in jet engines to do predictive maintenance, saving downtime. Around 2013, William Ruh, a former Cisco Systems executive brought in to put together the San Ramon software center, started expanding Predix to other G.E. industrial businesses.But that soon felt too small. The issue was \u201coutside disrupters,\u201d Mr. Ruh said, citing the online lodging start-up Airbnb as an example of rivals that can appear seemingly out of nowhere and that \u201cbring greater productivity \u2014 but don\u2019t own the assets they sell.\u201d G.E., Mr. Ruh notes, is the ultimate big-asset company.The other threat was rising interest among tech companies to take their internet connectivity expertise and try to apply it to industrial businesses. To get ahead of all this, G.E. reimagined Predix as a cloud-based operating system for industrial applications.Mr. Kodesh leads that effort. He ticks off the looming competitors: Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and others. \u201cThose companies are going to encroach on the territory,\u201d Mr. Kodesh said. \u201cAre we going to capitulate, or build something like Predix?\u201dThe basic idea is that G.E. and outside software developers will write programs to run on Predix. This software might, for instance, monitor the health and fine-tune the operation of equipment like oil-field rigs and wind-farm turbines, improving performance, reducing wear and adapting to changing environmental conditions. It amounts to software delivering the equivalent of personalized medicine for machines.Like any other computer operating system, Predix aims to take the complexity out of writing programs, so more people can create them. And while the instincts of the industrial world are proprietary, G.E. is following an open-source model with Predix, providing a basic design, but one open to outside contributors \u2014 more like Android from Google than Windows from Microsoft.Predix, Mr. Kodesh said, will be improved using the software equivalent of Lego blocks. \u201cSome will be G.E.\u2019s, and some will be made by third-party developers,\u201d he said.G.E. is betting that its deep knowledge of industry will give it an edge in this software arms race. The stakes for this kind of programming can be high.For a regular consumer using the internet, a misfiring algorithm in the software \u2014 \u201ca false positive\u201d \u2014 might mean a person sees an irrelevant online ad, or a bad Amazon book suggestion or Netflix movie recommendation, Mr. Kodesh said. Useless, perhaps, but not necessarily costly. But a false positive that prompts an airline to take a jet engine off the wing, Mr. Kodesh said, is a $100,000 mistake.\u201cWe really do need to have different technology, different algorithms and a different cloud, than in the consumer internet,\u201d he said.G.E. has set an ambitious target for Predix. It hopes to attract $100 million in orders this year, on its way to $4 billion in revenue by 2020. By then, the company forecasts that its total digital business \u2014 more than 90 percent of it software \u2014 may reach as much as $15 billion, up from $6 billion now.For Predix to reach its potential, though, G.E. needs outside programmers to write software for it. The company, with its deep pockets, can start the software-writing parade, but will others follow?This will be a major test. And G.E.\u2019s campaign to build an industrial operating system and create a flourishing ecosystem of software for it is just getting underway in earnest.In late July, G.E. hosted a Predix conference in Las Vegas, which attracted 1,200 software developers. Such developer gatherings are part of the playbook of every major software company but unusual for an industrial corporation.G.E. has some built-in advantages. Its installed base is huge. For example, the company says more than a third of the world\u2019s electricity is generated on G.E. equipment. It can make progress simply by winning over the aircraft makers, oil companies, hospitals and utilities that now depend on G.E. machinery.G.E. is starting to attract a developer following. Tata Consultancy Services, for one, says it now has 500 programmers designing and developing Predix applications for customers in the electric-utility, aviation and health care industries. G.E. also promotes partnerships with Infosys, Wipro and Capgemini to help business write Predix software.When he joined in 2011, Mr. Ruh had no illusions that making software a strength at a heavy-industry company would be easy. At the time, he told Mr. Immelt that would be \u201ca 10-year journey,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of that journey.\u201dPart of that is an effort to change an engineering culture that stretches back generations. \u201cIf G.E. is truly going to be a digital-industrial company, we can\u2019t be separate here,\u201d Mr. Ruh said of his software division. Digital \u201ctools and habits\u201d need to be embedded \u201cin how people do their jobs,\u201d he said.In its factory in Greenville, S.C., G.E. produces both giant power generators and evidence that this metamorphosis might work.The three-story building is crowded with immense cranes and milling, grinding and welding machines, overseen by manufacturing engineers and technicians. The finishing touches are being put on one of G.E.\u2019s new gas turbines.It looks like the business end of a rocket ship lying on its side, a gleaming steel dynamo at rest. It weighs 950,000 pounds. It fires up at nearly 2,900 degrees Fahrenheit, and it can generate enough electricity to supply more than 500,000 households.The gas turbine was brought to market in half the typical five years. That kind of accelerated product development is a performance that G.E. hopes to replicate across its industrial businesses. And it is a story of changes in design and manufacturing practices made possible by digital technology.John Lammas, the 56-year-old vice president for power generation engineering, started his working career 40 years ago, on the shop floor of a Rolls-Royce jet engine factory in Birmingham, England. He has been with G.E. for 31 years, moving up the ranks of the company\u2019s jet engine and power turbine divisions.\u201cI\u2019m an old mechanical guy,\u201d he said. But a couple of years ago, he issued an edict: no more paper drawings.In the past, a model of a new part would be made and then converted to detailed blueprints running to 70 pages or more. These would then be physically sent to G.E. manufacturing engineers and outside suppliers to begin setting up the tooling, casting and cutting for the part.This prototype-and-blueprint routine took up to eight weeks. Now, engineers use 3-D computer models, skip the prototype step and instantly send the models electronically.This goes a step beyond computer-aided design, which is commonplace. In Greenville, the designers are for the first time linked directly with manufacturers and suppliers in real time, in what G.E. calls a \u201cdigital thread.\u201d This means they can collaborate in ways that have changed the work process while making it more likely that problems or defects are spotted sooner.Traditionally, one set of engineers designed a part, and only then passed it on to manufacturing. If a problem arose on the supplier side, the design was kicked back and the process started over. \u201cJobs are combining in this digital world,\u201d Mr. Lammas said.Greenville\u2019s own equipment has been a Predix guinea pig. The machinery and factory were retrofitted with data-generating sensors and the software. Matt Krause, the plant manager, said that last winter, when a snowstorm shut the factory for a day, the sensor network detected that the plant had consumed 1,000 pounds of argon, an inert gas used in coatings for parts. The leak was fixed, saving $350,000 a year.\u201cWe can see things we never did before,\u201d Mr. Krause said. Over all, 60 of 200 steps in design and production have been automated or eliminated, reducing work time by 530,000 hours over three years, G.E. estimates.Not all the start-up ideas that G.E. is trying to breed translate comfortably to heavy industry. Lean proponents urge companies to come up with \u201cminimum viable products,\u201d particularly test versions of software programs. But no one wants a minimum viable jet engine or power generator.Yet in Greenville, engineers in the design stages are encouraged to move faster in smaller steps, conduct more experiments, and be willing to fail and try again. It amounts to a sea change in the engineering culture of heavy industry.\u201cAs an engineer, not getting it right the first time, I find painful,\u201d said Bill Byrne, an engineering manager. \u201cIt\u2019s uncomfortable. But it\u2019s been incredibly liberating.\u201dThe old ways, said Mr. Lammas, the engineering chief, had merit. Each step and rule was logical on its own. But the emphasis on flawless execution and perfection fostered a fear of failure. \u201cOvercoming that culture was probably the biggest challenge,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Oracle, Money\u2019s Not the Problem. It\u2019s Coping With the Cloud.", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe hard part is now in the hands of Thomas Kurian, a soft-spoken 49-year-old who has to figure out how the new purchase will work with what Oracle already has.While Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle\u2019s brash executive chairman, is still an outsize personality at the company he co-founded, Mr. Kurian has been the key figure in Oracle\u2019s attempted reinvention, overseeing sweeping changes in its engineering. That includes the creation of a network of 21 data centers around the world, a project that has cost perhaps $15 billion. NetSuite is Oracle\u2019s first major acquisition intended to tie right into this new global system.\u201cMoney isn\u2019t the problem for us,\u201d said Mr. Kurian, who is Oracle\u2019s president of product development. He added that \u201cbetween 2004 and 2014 we spent some $40 billion to $45 billion on acquisitions.\u201dOracle became a giant by selling directly to businesses software packages that do things like manage the books and keep track of customers. Now most industry experts think the company needs to show that it is finally in a position to rein in competitors that have been stealing customers away with fresher technology delivered over the internet, a concept called cloud computing.And the trade-offs Oracle must now make \u2014 accepting lower profit margins because customers are less interested in the older, pricier technology \u2014 reflect the hard decisions many older tech companies must make to avoid getting left behind.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt Oracle moved late,\u201d said Al Hilwa, an analyst at IDC. \u201cThey had doubts about the business, and the profit margins, but the way companies are spending forced them to change.\u201dOracle\u2019s new data centers are intended to power a cloud-computing network to compete with the established services provided by the likes of Google, Amazon, Microsoft and IBM. And the NetSuite acquisition could help Oracle pull even with smaller, cloud-focused companies like Salesforce and Workday, which provide their own technology to manage business operations like sales and human resources.Mr. Kurian would seem an unlikely person to play such a key role in one of Silicon Valley\u2019s iconic companies. Born and raised in a middle-class family in Bangalore, India, Mr. Kurian ended his first day in the United States in his freshman dorm room at Princeton University, which he shared with his identical twin, George, who is now chief executive at NetApp, another Silicon Valley company.\u201cThe day we left India was the first day we saw a computer,\u201d said George Kurian, who after graduation worked at Oracle while Thomas Kurian was a consultant at McKinsey. The two also went to Stanford Business School together.Mark V. Hurd and Safra A. Catz, both chief executives at Oracle, manage the company\u2019s sales and finance. Mr. Ellison, who is 71 and shows no inclination to retire, counts on Mr. Kurian to run the core of any big tech company: thousands of engineers.The NetSuite deal is something of a coming-out party for Oracle\u2019s global cloud, possibly signaling the start of a new round of acquisitions, along with hefty spending to keep building out this network. But spending upward of $2 billion a year on building a cloud network, Mr. Kurian said, is table stakes for the biggest tech companies.In NetSuite, Oracle saw a cloud company whose sales of e-commerce and manufacturing software to smaller businesses were stalling as it tried to move into international markets. Oracle figured it could distribute that software efficiently over its cloud. It also hopes to reach smaller companies that can\u2019t afford Oracle\u2019s traditional high-cost, high-maintenance product.Mr. Ellison played no role in the acquisition of NetSuite, according to Oracle, since he owns about 40 percent of that company. Mr. Ellison, who is already worth $45 billion, according to Bloomberg, will reap another $3.7 billion on the NetSuite deal. He still attends regular corporate strategy sessions, along with Mr. Hurd, Ms. Catz and Mr. Kurian, grilling each on their respective portfolios.Oracle has hundreds of different types of software for businesses, but more than anything it is known for powerful databases. Many global airlines, banks and manufacturers wouldn\u2019t function without them.Customers treat the big, Oracle-strength software like sacred objects that should never be altered, while they\u2019re happy to experiment, for example, with a new offering from Amazon. That\u2019s one reason Oracle has a hard time moving toward new technology, said Steve Miranda, Oracle\u2019s vice president of applications development.\u201cNew companies have what is called \u2018a minimum viable product\u2019 they can sell,\u201d said Mr. Miranda, a 24-year veteran at Oracle. At his company, Mr. Miranda said, that minimum is in reality a fairly high-end product.Mr. Kurian, who has been at Oracle for 20 years, is known to move quickly in meetings, seeking slides ahead of a presentation and immediately zeroing in on the one slide where he spots a problem. If there are no problems, the meeting is canceled. Soft-spoken or not, he will let rip a profanity-laced tirade if he sees too many problems.\u201cI won\u2019t comment on the language, but we are very honest with each other, very hard on ourselves and very direct,\u201d said Mr. Miranda. \u201cIf you\u2019re striving to be the best of the best, it comes with the territory.\u201dMuch of that revenue comes from selling bare-bones computing that Oracle doesn\u2019t care about. But increasingly Amazon is offering its own databases, and customers are signing on. It targets Oracle directly at its promotional events, and offers something called \u201cserverless computing,\u201d which charges for applications per line of code rather than monthly fees or upfront licenses \u2014 another potential threat to Oracle\u2019s profit margins.Oracle has built a large operation in Seattle, paying big for cloud talent from Amazon and Microsoft. (Google also has operations there, making Seattle something of the nation\u2019s cloud town.) But local hands there say Oracle isn\u2019t yet a noticeable presence.\u201cRight now, I go to all-day meetings, and their name doesn\u2019t come up,\u201d said Matt McIlwain, a managing director of the Madrona Venture Group, a Seattle venture firm.The next big competition in cloud computing also involves artificial intelligence, fed by loads of data. Soon, Mr. Kurian said, Oracle will offer applications that draw from what it knows about the people whose actions are recorded in Oracle databases.

{"Headline": "Apple Will Pay a \u2018Bug Bounty\u2019 to Hackers Who Report Flaws", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "Supported byLAS VEGAS \u2014 Apple, which has been criticized in recent years for failing to pay outside hackers who report bugs in its products, said on Thursday that it would begin offering a so-called bug bounty to technologists who alert the company to flaws.At the Black Hat hacking conference, Apple announced a list of vulnerabilities that would command big bounties, including $25,000 for ways around Apple\u2019s digital compartments and into its customers\u2019 data, $50,000 for bugs that give hackers a way into iCloud data, and $200,000 to turn over critical vulnerabilities in Apple\u2019s firmware \u2014 the software that lies closest to the bare metal of the machine.Apple said that if hackers donated their rewards to charity, it would match their donation. \u201cWe want to reward the people, and frankly the creativity it takes to find bugs in these categories,\u201d said Ivan Krstic, Apple\u2019s head of security engineering and architecture.For six years, nearly every company in Silicon Valley has been rewarding hackers who turn over bugs \u2014 a term for flaws that can make a product vulnerable to intrusion \u2014 in their systems, with cash. The hope is that the money will be an incentive to keep those flaws out of the hands of organized groups or spy agencies willing to pay big money to learn about them.But Apple had stayed away from the practice. Instead, it had credited anyone who turned over bugs by putting their names on its website \u2014 a far cry from the tens of thousands of dollars, and in some cases hundreds of thousands of dollars, companies like Google and Facebook were willing to pay.The annual Black Hat conference, now in its 19th year, is a gathering place for all sorts of experts on computer security, including hackers, tech industry executives and government officials.Dan Kaminsky, a respected security researcher, said in a keynote speech that the industry was falling far short of expectations. The onslaught of regular, high-profile hacks, like the recent penetration of computers run by the Democratic National Committee, is beginning to make customers believe that little can be done to protect them.\u201cWe made promises in technology, and people are starting not to believe them\u201d Mr. Kaminsky told the audience. \u201cEverybody looks busy but the house still burns.\u201d Mr. Kaminsky argued for a cybersecurity equivalent of the National Institutes of Health or a Manhattan Project to fund research.Notably, a fund-raiser for Hillary Clinton coincided with this year\u2019s conference. Tickets for the \u201cHackers for Hillary\u201d fund-raiser were going for anywhere from $100 to $2,700. According to the event organizers, the fund-raiser focused on \u201ccyber policy issues the next administration faces.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Last week Deadline.com and Variety asked Mr. Parker about the case, and on Tuesday, Variety reported that his accuser committed suicide in 2012 at age 30.In a statement to The New York Times, the woman\u2019s family said: \u201cWe appreciate that after all this time, these men are being held accountable for their actions. However, we are dubious of the underlying motivations that bring this to present light after 17 years, and we will not take part in stoking its coals. While we cannot protect the victim from this media storm, we can do our best to protect her son. For that reason, we ask for privacy for our family and do not wish to comment further.\u201dBut the woman\u2019s sister, Sharon Loeffler, said that statement did not represent the sentiments of other family members or the woman herself. \u201cI know what she would\u2019ve said,\u201d Ms. Loeffler said, \u201cand that would be, \u2018I fought long and hard, it overcame me. All I can ask is any other victims to come forward, and not let this kind of tolerance to go on anymore.\u2019\u201d Ms. Loeffler said her sister had believed there were other victims and had been broken by the 1999 case and its aftermath. \u201cThese guys sucked the soul and life out of her.\u201dHere\u2019s a look at the case.WHAT WE KNOWMr. Parker was accused in 1999 of raping a fellow student at Penn State. The victim, whose name is not public, said that Mr. Parker and his roommate, Mr. Celestin, raped her while she was intoxicated and unconscious, according to court documents, and that they later harassed, intimidated and stalked her after she pressed charges. Both men said that the sex was consensual.Mr. Parker, who, according to court transcripts, had had consensual oral sex with the woman previously, was acquitted of the charges. Mr. Celestin, who received a \u201cstory by\u201d credit on \u201cThe Birth of a Nation,\u201d was convicted of sexual assault, but his case was appealed. There are conflicting accounts about the outcome.The woman, under the name Jane Doe, then sued Penn State for failing to protect her from harassment; the case was settled for $17,500. According to court records, the victim had twice attempted suicide after the alleged rape. According to a court document, as a result of the harassment, the accuser \u201csuffered severe depression, sleeplessness, and anxiety attacks.\u201d She also said that her apartment had been broken into and that her files on the case had been \u201cdisturbed.\u201dWHAT MR. PARKER HAS SAID ABOUT THE CASE\u201cI talked about it publicly and I never sought to hide it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the most painful thing I have ever had to experience. I can imagine it was painful for a lot of people.\u201dHe also said that he \u201cwelcomed the conversation.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a serious issue. I get it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality is there is a problem on campuses in America, and violence against women is not taken seriously enough. And the dialogue and the discourse isn\u2019t loud enough. I think there\u2019s even more that can be done to educate university students, men and women. Being a father of daughters\u201d \u2014 he has five daughters, three with his wife \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s important to say if something happened, to lift your voice.\u201dHe later said: \u201cThey say the oppressor is anyone who\u2019s not on the side of the oppressed. I stand firmly on the side of the oppressed.\u201dAsked if justice had been served in the case, he replied: \u201cI was cleared of all charges. We\u2019re talking 17 years later. We\u2019re discussing a case which was thoroughly litigated. I was cleared of everything. At some point I have to ask myself, \u2018How often am I willing to relive it?\u2019\u201dWHY THIS IS A STORY NOW\u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d tells the story of Nat Turner, who led a slave rebellion in Virginia in 1831. The film was first screened at the Sundance Film Festival this year, shortly after the all-white slate of Oscar acting nominees set off an outcry as well as a larger conversation about the lack of diversity in Hollywood.Almost everything about the film seemed a remedy to all that, including its name, a sharply pointed reappropriation (not a remake) of D. W. Griffith\u2019s landmark and racist 1915 film of the same title. Born into poverty, Mr. Parker, whose previous films include \u201cThe Secret Life of Bees,\u201d \u201cRed Tails\u201d and \u201cBeyond the Lights,\u201d had made telling Turner\u2019s story a passion project, even turning down other work. He wanted Americans to face the legacy of slavery head on, and said the country\u2019s aversion to doing so led to countless modern-day problems, including tensions between the police and black Americans. Support for the film surged. Last weekend, at the film festival on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Mr. Parker and his co-star, Aja Naomi King, appeared on a panel with Mr. Lee, who urged audience members to pack the theaters when it opens.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Oracle, Money\u2019s Not the Problem. It\u2019s Coping With the Cloud.", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported byThe hard part is now in the hands of Thomas Kurian, a soft-spoken 49-year-old who has to figure out how the new purchase will work with what Oracle already has.While Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle\u2019s brash executive chairman, is still an outsize personality at the company he co-founded, Mr. Kurian has been the key figure in Oracle\u2019s attempted reinvention, overseeing sweeping changes in its engineering. That includes the creation of a network of 21 data centers around the world, a project that has cost perhaps $15 billion. NetSuite is Oracle\u2019s first major acquisition intended to tie right into this new global system.\u201cMoney isn\u2019t the problem for us,\u201d said Mr. Kurian, who is Oracle\u2019s president of product development. He added that \u201cbetween 2004 and 2014 we spent some $40 billion to $45 billion on acquisitions.\u201dOracle became a giant by selling directly to businesses software packages that do things like manage the books and keep track of customers. Now most industry experts think the company needs to show that it is finally in a position to rein in competitors that have been stealing customers away with fresher technology delivered over the internet, a concept called cloud computing.And the trade-offs Oracle must now make \u2014 accepting lower profit margins because customers are less interested in the older, pricier technology \u2014 reflect the hard decisions many older tech companies must make to avoid getting left behind.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt Oracle moved late,\u201d said Al Hilwa, an analyst at IDC. \u201cThey had doubts about the business, and the profit margins, but the way companies are spending forced them to change.\u201dOracle\u2019s new data centers are intended to power a cloud-computing network to compete with the established services provided by the likes of Google, Amazon, Microsoft and IBM. And the NetSuite acquisition could help Oracle pull even with smaller, cloud-focused companies like Salesforce and Workday, which provide their own technology to manage business operations like sales and human resources.Mr. Kurian would seem an unlikely person to play such a key role in one of Silicon Valley\u2019s iconic companies. Born and raised in a middle-class family in Bangalore, India, Mr. Kurian ended his first day in the United States in his freshman dorm room at Princeton University, which he shared with his identical twin, George, who is now chief executive at NetApp, another Silicon Valley company.\u201cThe day we left India was the first day we saw a computer,\u201d said George Kurian, who after graduation worked at Oracle while Thomas Kurian was a consultant at McKinsey. The two also went to Stanford Business School together.Mark V. Hurd and Safra A. Catz, both chief executives at Oracle, manage the company\u2019s sales and finance. Mr. Ellison, who is 71 and shows no inclination to retire, counts on Mr. Kurian to run the core of any big tech company: thousands of engineers.The NetSuite deal is something of a coming-out party for Oracle\u2019s global cloud, possibly signaling the start of a new round of acquisitions, along with hefty spending to keep building out this network. But spending upward of $2 billion a year on building a cloud network, Mr. Kurian said, is table stakes for the biggest tech companies.In NetSuite, Oracle saw a cloud company whose sales of e-commerce and manufacturing software to smaller businesses were stalling as it tried to move into international markets. Oracle figured it could distribute that software efficiently over its cloud. It also hopes to reach smaller companies that can\u2019t afford Oracle\u2019s traditional high-cost, high-maintenance product.Mr. Ellison played no role in the acquisition of NetSuite, according to Oracle, since he owns about 40 percent of that company. Mr. Ellison, who is already worth $45 billion, according to Bloomberg, will reap another $3.7 billion on the NetSuite deal. He still attends regular corporate strategy sessions, along with Mr. Hurd, Ms. Catz and Mr. Kurian, grilling each on their respective portfolios.Oracle has hundreds of different types of software for businesses, but more than anything it is known for powerful databases. Many global airlines, banks and manufacturers wouldn\u2019t function without them.Customers treat the big, Oracle-strength software like sacred objects that should never be altered, while they\u2019re happy to experiment, for example, with a new offering from Amazon. That\u2019s one reason Oracle has a hard time moving toward new technology, said Steve Miranda, Oracle\u2019s vice president of applications development.\u201cNew companies have what is called \u2018a minimum viable product\u2019 they can sell,\u201d said Mr. Miranda, a 24-year veteran at Oracle. At his company, Mr. Miranda said, that minimum is in reality a fairly high-end product.Mr. Kurian, who has been at Oracle for 20 years, is known to move quickly in meetings, seeking slides ahead of a presentation and immediately zeroing in on the one slide where he spots a problem. If there are no problems, the meeting is canceled. Soft-spoken or not, he will let rip a profanity-laced tirade if he sees too many problems.\u201cI won\u2019t comment on the language, but we are very honest with each other, very hard on ourselves and very direct,\u201d said Mr. Miranda. \u201cIf you\u2019re striving to be the best of the best, it comes with the territory.\u201dMuch of that revenue comes from selling bare-bones computing that Oracle doesn\u2019t care about. But increasingly Amazon is offering its own databases, and customers are signing on. It targets Oracle directly at its promotional events, and offers something called \u201cserverless computing,\u201d which charges for applications per line of code rather than monthly fees or upfront licenses \u2014 another potential threat to Oracle\u2019s profit margins.Oracle has built a large operation in Seattle, paying big for cloud talent from Amazon and Microsoft. (Google also has operations there, making Seattle something of the nation\u2019s cloud town.) But local hands there say Oracle isn\u2019t yet a noticeable presence.\u201cRight now, I go to all-day meetings, and their name doesn\u2019t come up,\u201d said Matt McIlwain, a managing director of the Madrona Venture Group, a Seattle venture firm.The next big competition in cloud computing also involves artificial intelligence, fed by loads of data. Soon, Mr. Kurian said, Oracle will offer applications that draw from what it knows about the people whose actions are recorded in Oracle databases. The company has anonymized data from 1,500 companies, including three billion consumers and 400 million business profiles, representing $3 trillion in consumer purchases.\u201cMost of the world\u2019s data is already inside Oracle databases,\u201d said Mr. Kurian.That\u2019s the kind of hold on people\u2019s information that perhaps only Facebook can match. But Mark Zuckerberg doesn\u2019t sell business software. At least, not yet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Unlikely Facebook Friendship Saves Afghan Baby With Heart Defect", "Date": "2016-08-14", "News": "Supported byHOLON, Israel \u2014 They had never met, but they were Facebook friends connected across thousands of miles. Together the two digital acquaintances \u2014 a young English teacher in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, and a retired State Department official living in Haifa, Israel \u2014 collaborated to save a baby in Pakistan with life-threatening congenital heart problems.Yehia, now 14 months old, had been born with his two main arteries reversed and two holes in his heart. His parents, Afghans living in Peshawar, Pakistan, found a local specialist who could perform the necessary surgery, but the price tag was $7,000. It might as well have been seven figures to the child\u2019s father, who makes his living selling flour. The family\u2019s savings, $200, had already been depleted by medical bills.On a trip to Afghanistan for a family wedding in April, they sought out a relative, Farhad Zaheer, a teacher in Jalalabad who speaks English and is active on social media. Could he help? \u201cNo problem,\u201d Mr. Zaheer, 29, recalls telling them. \u201cI said, \u2018I know lots of people, and I will contact them.\u2019\u201dAmong the people he contacted was Anna Mussman, 69, who has both American and Israeli citizenship. Mr. Zaheer had sent Ms. Mussman a friend request in 2012 after he worked on a project training teachers in Nouristan Province, which Ms. Mussman was overseeing for the State Department. He remembered Ms. Mussman, he said, because she commented kindly on his posts.Social media has flattened communications across the globe, sometimes allowing for remarkable connections like this.\u201cHello dear Madam!\u201d Mr. Zaheer wrote in a Facebook message, with a photo of young Yehia attached. \u201cThis boy is my cousin who has been suffering from hole in heart. If you can do anything for his good health, we would be very thankful to you.\u201d Ms. Mussman, who was born to Holocaust survivors in a displaced persons camp in Germany, jumped. Within a few hours she had contacted Simon Fisher, the executive director of Save a Child\u2019s Heart, an Israeli charity that she had heard about once on CNN. The group provides free surgeries to children from developing countries.\u201cI realize helping a child from a country which Israel has no diplomatic relations is not easy, but perhaps possible,\u201d Ms. Mussman wrote to Mr. Fisher in an email. \u201cThanks so much and Shabbat Shalom.\u201dIt did not get any less complicated from there. Numerous other strangers and acquaintances helped plot a multicountry medical odyssey that barely skirted last month\u2019s failed coup attempt in Turkey and culminated in an eight-hour surgery on July 30 at Wolfson Medical Center here in Holon, a city near Tel Aviv.Yehia \u2014 whose father spoke on the condition that the family name not be published for fear of a backlash if it became known he had taken the boy to Israel for treatment \u2014 is the first Afghan treated by Save a Child\u2019s Heart in its 20 years of operations. About half the charity\u2019s 4,000 patients have been Palestinian; 200 others were children from Iraq and Syria, and the roster includes patients from Tanzania, Ethiopia and Moldova.Israel boosters often highlight such programs as examples of the small nation\u2019s outsized humanitarian efforts, including to hostile neighbors. Leora Robinson, a second-year medical student in Britain who is doing an internship at the charity, said that it provided an important counterpoint to portrayals of Israel as an occupier of Palestinian land, as she saw on campus during Israel Apartheid Week. \u201cIt opens eyes to the fact that this country doesn\u2019t just have one side to it,\u201d Ms. Robinson said.But Tony Laurance, head of a group called Medical Aid for Palestinians, said that while providing children \u201cworld-class surgery\u201d was \u201can unequivocal good,\u201d it should not obscure the broader impact of Israeli policies on medical care for Palestinians. Gaza hospitals are perennially short of medicine, equipment and well-trained staff members, and many Gaza residents struggle to get exit permits for care outside the territory.\u201cWhat gets up my nose,\u201d Mr. Laurance said, \u201cis that it presents an image of Israel that betrays the reality.\u201dMr. Fisher, executive director of Save a Child\u2019s Heart, said his organization did not represent Israel\u2019s government, \u201cbut it does represent Israeli society.\u201d Public and private foundations and governments provide the annual budget of $3.5 million, he said, and about 70 health care workers volunteer their time.It was Mr. Fisher who, drawing on years of contacts, obtained Israeli visas for Yehia and his father after Ms. Mussman contacted him. But they would have to travel through Turkey.Ms. Moini volunteered to meet Yehia and his father in Istanbul, accompany them to Tel Aviv, and be an extra pair of hands to care for him.But her July 15 flight was canceled because of the attempted coup in Turkey. Save a Child\u2019s Heart managed to find her a last-minute flight out of Toronto to Istanbul.Mr. Fisher of Save a Child\u2019s Heart worked to find a translator to help the father, who speaks Urdu and Pashto, communicate with the Hebrew-speaking staff. He remembered that during his time in the Israeli Army he had served with a soldier whose mother came from Kabul\u2019s ancient Jewish community. He called the soldier, Yossi Betsalel \u2014 could his mother, Tsipora, translate? No, Mr. Betsalel said, she had long forgotten her native tongue. But she had a relative \u2013 Jacob Gul, 56, a retired rug seller, who had left Kabul 32 years ago and was probably still proficient. Mr. Gul immediately agreed to translate, and Ms. Betsalel ended up visiting Yehia in the hospital frequently.Unaware of those efforts, back in Jalalabad, Mr. Zaheer contacted another Facebook connection he had never met: Michael Davidson, a 70-year-old Israeli who had immigrated from India in 1978 \u2014 and who speaks Urdu. Mr. Davidson and Mr. Gul were both on hand in Holon for the surgery, along with Ms. Moini and Ms. Betsalel, who said she had closed her clothing shop early because she could not concentrate while Yehia was having his operation.Dr. Yahyu Mekonnen, 33, an Ethiopian surgeon, opened Yehia\u2019s chest. Dr. Lior Sasson, who headed an operating team of nearly a dozen people, hummed an Israeli song while they stopped his tiny heart, to patch it up.Eventually, they wheeled Yehia out, covered in bandages, even over his eyes. His father was surrounded by a makeshift family he had only just met.\u201cYou can cry,\u201d Mr. Davidson urged.Mr. Gul offered a tissue. Ms. Moini touched his shoulder. Ms. Betsalel showed him photos of his son on her iPhone.The father broke through his sobs with a polite smile.An article on Aug. 15 about a Facebook friendship that ended up saving the life of an Afghan baby who received heart surgery through an Israeli charity, Save a Child\u2019s Heart, misstated part of the name of a group led by Tony Laurance, who praised the outreach but criticized Israeli restrictions on medical care for Palestinians. The group is Medical Aid for Palestinians (not for Palestine). The article also overstated the impact of Israeli restrictions on travel and trade in the Gaza Strip, and overstated what is known about the financing of Save a Child\u2019s Heart. Although the restrictions have made the import of some medical equipment difficult, the import of medicine is not restricted. According to the charity\u2019s director, Simon Fisher, it receives money from the governments of Israel, the European Union and the United States, as well as Christian ministries, Jewish congregations, public and private foundations and individuals worldwide, but he said he did not know whether most of the money was from private Jewish donors.Advertisement"}

For a while, its big nightclub, XL, drew a crowd. But its relative popularity was short-lived.The hotel tried to play up its gay-branding in certain special events and in its lobby art. Earlier this summer, the lobby walls were adorned with Barbie doll dioramas that depicted various dolls in same-sex situations: two male dolls walking hand-in-hand; two women \u2014 one in a white gown, another in a white sleeveless tuxedo \u2014 at their wedding.Ms. Ader spent a lot of time at the hotel, installing her art and looking in to witness reactions to it. \u201cIt was a very mixed group of tourists,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t necessarily a place for the gay community.\u201dThe necessity for a so-called gay hotel in the center of New York City was never entirely clear. \u201cGays travel a lot and for anyone who travels a lot, the hospitality industry goes out of its way to be very hospitable,\u201d said Nathan Lump, the editor in chief of Travel & Leisure and editorial director of Time Inc.\u2019s lifestyle group.He added: \u201cI have traveled with my husband in some countries that are not super gay-friendly. But when you check in to an international hotel, you know they are not going to treat you terribly when you ask for a king-sized bed. The industry as a whole is very inclusive.\u201d\u201cThe most interesting portion of the hotel is the interior courtyard,\u201d said Mr. Kamali, who has toured the space. \u201cHaving access to outdoor space in Manhattan that is off the street is incredibly unique,\u201d he said.Certainly, a nice spot for a summertime glass of ros\u00e9.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Blocks Ad Blockers, but It Strives to Make Ads More Relevant", "Date": "2016-08-09", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Digital ads pop up online so frequently and ubiquitously that many people are using software to block them.But if you try to stop ads from showing up on Facebook\u2019s desktop website, you will now be out of luck: The social network has found a way to block the ad blockers.On Tuesday, Facebook flipped a switch on its desktop website that essentially renders all ad blockers \u2014 the programs that prevent websites from displaying ads on the page when a user visits the site \u2014 useless. The change allows the Silicon Valley company to serve ads on its desktop site even to people who have ad-blocking software installed and running.\u201cDisruptive ads are an industry problem, and the rise of ad blockers is a strong signal that people just don\u2019t want to see them,\u201d Andrew Bosworth, vice president for Facebook\u2019s ads and business platform, said in an interview. \u201cBut ad blockers are a really bad solution to that.\u201dMr. Bosworth of Facebook said ad blockers were \u201ccertainly bad for the publications who are robbed of half of the value exchange between users and publishers.\u201d But rather than blocking all ads, he said, Facebook needed to find a way to serve better ads.Facebook\u2019s move is perhaps the strongest anti-ad-blocking measure taken by a major technology company, especially one that serves advertising to more than 1.7 billion monthly users globally. The effort is risky for the company, which prides itself on delivering the best user experience, because it could alienate some people for whom ad blocking is an ideological stance on how they wish to gain access to the internet.To shut down the blockers, Facebook is taking aim at the signifiers in digital ads that blockers use to detect whether something is an ad. Facebook\u2019s desktop sitewide changes will then make ad content indistinguishable from non-advertising content. For blockers to get around these changes, Facebook said they would have to begin analyzing the content of the ads themselves, a costly and laborious process.Still, Facebook will continue to let people have some control over the ads they do and do not see. On Tuesday, the company also introduced an overhauled version of its ad preferences tool, which lets people opt out of seeing certain types of ads on the site.

More than images of rock, classical or hip-hop musicians, jazz images, like those of Ted Williams, who studied saxophone and clarinet before picking up the camera after World War II, seem to capture the intangible essence of a thought being transformed into sound. Maybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the way the photos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lithe rhythms of light and dark riff on the rhythms in the music. Or maybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the way photography by its nature encapsulates the never-to-be-repeated instant, which is the building block of jazz improvisation. Or maybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just the cool suits. Whatever. Charlie Parker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s photograph erupts from the frame with the kinetic restlessness of his blowing; Dizzy Gillespie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disarming studiousness over the chessboard hums like his geometric solos. Count Basie is all smoke and rhythm, and Billie Holiday doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need sound to sing the blues. The camera says it all for her. Listen to Williams\u00e2\u0080\u0099s portrait of Paul Desmond (reserved, measured) beside his volcanic shot of John Coltrane. Hear the difference? You can almost fill in the sounds of the bass and drums, the temperature in the room, the suspended breath of the audience, wondering what will come next. In the photographs, of course, it never does. Like good jazz, they leave you with endless possibility waiting to happen. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a promise and a reward at once. (Someday, maybe someone will think to replace the American flag with an old Blue Note album cover, and then the national anthem will really swing. Maybe.)  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a long period of time. The country was changing, the music was changing. The civil rights movement surged and peaked. The audience, by the end, was mostly elsewhere. In these photographs, though, the music plays on, never dated, always right on time."}
{"Headline": "What Protest Looks Like", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "Supported byThe StoneThis theory of the state underlies media and state reporting of political protest, in which violence is always invoked to disqualify the grievances of protesters. In the 1960s, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was able to to use media coverage of disproportionate violence against nonresisting demonstrators in Birmingham or Selma to convey his message as a form of martyrdom. He wrote: \u201cwe\u2019ll wear you down by our capacity to suffer\u2026we will so appeal to your heart and conscience that we will win you in the process.\u201dToday, if police dogs attack demonstrators, it is no longer national news. Ironically, the example of King himself, so often vilified as a traitor and a Communist in his lifetime, is used to berate today\u2019s protesters with the demand for nonviolence, meaning compliance with police instructions. King never intended nonviolence to mean compliance with the state. But when the term violence is used, it now signifies a moral and political failing by the \u201cpeople,\u201d those not authorized to use force. Whenever Palestinians protest against the occupation of their land, the response in some quarters is always to call it violent, no matter what has happened. So I find myself avoiding the term altogether in relation to protests.What activists then did in the U.S. was to create a performative form of protest that insisted we not look away but consider over and over again what had happened. \u201cHands Up, Don\u2019t Shoot\u201d calls our attention to the instant before the definitive violence, a moment where a reasonable person (to use legal phrasing) could and should have decided against shooting, for example, 12-year-old Tamir Rice. By performing this collectively, it also became a challenge to the police, saying in effect, \u201cyou don\u2019t dare to shoot, there are too many of us.\u201dThe mass \u201cdie-in,\u201d an action appropriated from earlier movements in which protesters mime death as a group, further emphasizes that all are potential targets. Performed death, a visual act, makes each person appear vulnerable, but simultaneously creates a sense of freedom as you rest your body with others in spaces where you never normally are at rest. Both these forms of protest create what I call a \u201cpersistent looking,\u201d a repeated return to the place of loss so that it is possible to move past the first shock of violence to an understanding of the systemic violence that brought it about.By comparison, the pictures of the body of Aylan Kurdi, the 3-year-old drowned Syrian toddler who washed up on a Turkish beach, broke through the shield that we all create in what the German philosopher Walter Benjamin called \u201cthe optical unconscious.\u201d An outpouring of grief in the West made it seem as if we were seeing refugees die for the first time, although such drownings have been common for decades. The picture of a Turkish policeman carrying his body resonated because of its association (whether conscious or not) with the Christian image known as the piet\u00e0, in which the Virgin Mary carries the body of the dead Christ. We looked at Aylan\u2019s body and realized that he had indeed died for our sins.A few months later, however, Britain voted to leave the European Union, largely because of intense resentment of all immigrants, including refugees. Here, then, is the dilemma. Certain images have the capacity to break through the defenses of our optical unconscious, but precisely because that unconscious is a way of dealing with the intense violence of modern life, it seals over quickly. When these moments occur, change results only if people organize around the general principle that such images convey.Black Lives Matter has done this. But in the case of Aylan Kurdi, while efforts were made for individual refugees, no general case for immigration and asylum was effectively promoted after his death. Still less did Western media outlets turn to the Kurdish community for understanding.Within these activist communities online, people often speak of being connected by love. This love is not romantic love between individuals but the collective bond that Dr. King called \u201cthe beloved community.\u201d For his colleague and friend Grace Lee Boggs, the result was what she called \u201cvisionary organizing.\u201d Such organizing thinks about how to make a life, not make a living. These exchanges are horizontal, requiring a good deal of time and energy to sustain. But they can make change.These are times for visionary organizing, not outraged reposting.There have been two notable responses to the breakdown of the space of appearance. Former protesters and the disillusioned have either set out to create a new politics of appearance or they have reacted by looking for groups to blame.From the Zapatistas to the global Occupy project and today\u2019s Nuit Debout movement in France, the politics of appearance is no longer about submitting a petition to power, but instead organizing so that people can appear to each other. That means suspending the regulation of the space of appearance by norms, above all the norms of racial hierarchy, and then refusing to move on out of that space. I believe that is why Black Lives Matter has acted to disrupt all the major presidential campaigns in 2016. It is seeking to form a new manner of being \u201cpolitical,\u201d a new way to see and be seen in the world.But the other possibility, the blaming of other groups, is a reaction to a sense of powerlessness. As we have seen in the past, these reactions are not correlated to factual evidence or even specific local experience. The Brexit vote was above all motivated by a hostility to immigration. But those voting on these grounds often live in places with low immigration, just as anti-Semitism in the past did not result from proximity to Jewish people.\u201cTake back control\u201d in Britain and \u201cMake America great again\u201d are, then, calls for a re-regulation of the space of appearance to exclude certain groups.When Trump speaks of a wall, his followers understand this to mean both a physical structure (which may or may not actually be constructed) and, more importantly, a conceptual exclusion from participation.There is no \u201ccommon ground\u201d between the politics of appearance and those of exclusion. In the United States, as the Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza has noted, \u201cwhen black people get free, everybody gets free.\u201d Which means that unless black people get free, nobody gets free. Until and unless there is a politics of recognition that might form a new space of appearance that is not structured on exclusion, there will be no liberation.But the resurgent politics of exclusion sometimes overwhelms our sense of that necessity. We seek expedient solutions and look to established leaders. Brexit showed that the defense of what W.E.B. Du Bois called the psychological \u201cwage\u201d of whiteness, its relative privileges, was more important to the majority population than actual economics. If Hillary Clinton fails to realize that it is no longer \u201cthe economy, stupid,\u201d a second reactionary victory might occur.Talk of tolerance and diversity has failed. The urgent task at hand, especially for people who are not themselves black, is to construct an anti-racist politics that is a common good. As Dr. King long ago realized, such politics can only work in tandem with anti-poverty and antiwar strategies. In the end, it comes down to this: When we see another person, do we see them as another human being, not just equal to us in law, but someone that we can listen to, learn from and fall in love with? Or not?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Blocks Ad Blockers, but It Strives to Make Ads More Relevant", "Date": "2016-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Digital ads pop up online so frequently and ubiquitously that many people are using software to block them.But if you try to stop ads from showing up on Facebook\u2019s desktop website, you will now be out of luck: The social network has found a way to block the ad blockers.On Tuesday, Facebook flipped a switch on its desktop website that essentially renders all ad blockers \u2014 the programs that prevent websites from displaying ads on the page when a user visits the site \u2014 useless. The change allows the Silicon Valley company to serve ads on its desktop site even to people who have ad-blocking software installed and running.\u201cDisruptive ads are an industry problem, and the rise of ad blockers is a strong signal that people just don\u2019t want to see them,\u201d Andrew Bosworth, vice president for Facebook\u2019s ads and business platform, said in an interview. \u201cBut ad blockers are a really bad solution to that.\u201dMr. Bosworth of Facebook said ad blockers were \u201ccertainly bad for the publications who are robbed of half of the value exchange between users and publishers.\u201d But rather than blocking all ads, he said, Facebook needed to find a way to serve better ads.Facebook\u2019s move is perhaps the strongest anti-ad-blocking measure taken by a major technology company, especially one that serves advertising to more than 1.7 billion monthly users globally. The effort is risky for the company, which prides itself on delivering the best user experience, because it could alienate some people for whom ad blocking is an ideological stance on how they wish to gain access to the internet.To shut down the blockers, Facebook is taking aim at the signifiers in digital ads that blockers use to detect whether something is an ad. Facebook\u2019s desktop sitewide changes will then make ad content indistinguishable from non-advertising content. For blockers to get around these changes, Facebook said they would have to begin analyzing the content of the ads themselves, a costly and laborious process.Still, Facebook will continue to let people have some control over the ads they do and do not see. On Tuesday, the company also introduced an overhauled version of its ad preferences tool, which lets people opt out of seeing certain types of ads on the site. That will help Facebook serve more relevant ads, rather than bombard people with ads they do not want.\u201cWe want people to help us do a better job with ads, rather than to fundamentally alter the way the service is rendered,\u201d Mr. Bosworth said.The move against ad blockers on the desktop site will not affect blockers used to access Facebook on a mobile web browser, the company said.

{"Headline": "Donald Trump, Wavering on Immigration, Finds Anger in All Corners", "Date": "2016-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYet even that promise, so central to his appeal to conservatives, now appears open to negotiation.Mr. Trump faced anger, confusion and disgust from across the political spectrum on Thursday after indicating that he was open to letting some undocumented immigrants remain in the country legally provided that they paid \u201cback taxes.\u201dThe comments, made at a town-hall-style event broadcast the night before on Fox News, were strikingly similar to the views of former Gov. Jeb Bush and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, fellow Republicans whom Mr. Trump vanquished in the primaries with slashing attacks that they were soft on immigration.His newest formulation also bore a close resemblance to President Obama\u2019s approach to an immigration overhaul, which similarly calls for paying taxes as part of a program to live legally in the United States.\u201cHe finally figured out that you can\u2019t win a national election with just white voters,\u201d said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster who worked for Mr. Rubio\u2019s campaign.Republicans have narrowed the Democrats\u2019 lead in registered voters in several swing states, especially in North Carolina and Florida.But whatever the possible gains, Mr. Trump risks offending millions of conservatives who were drawn to his self-description as an unwavering opponent of illegal immigration. He vowed to build a wall on the Mexican border, called Mexicans \u201crapists\u201d in his kickoff speech and said every immigrant in the country illegally would be detained and forced out.\u201cIf Trump should pivot on immigration or try to redefine amnesty, he will begin to lose support from his original core base,\u201d warned Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, one of the most conservative voices on immigration in the House.In the Fox News interview, Mr. Trump appeared to suggest that he would be open to some kind of path to legal status, if not citizenship, for undocumented immigrants.\u201cNo citizenship,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019ll pay back taxes. They have to pay taxes,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s no amnesty, but we will work with them.\u201dMr. Trump said that while his supporters wanted to \u201cget the bad ones out,\u201d he also had heard from less-absolutist voters. \u201cThey\u2019ve said, \u2018Mr. Trump, I love you, but to take a person that has been here for 15 or 20 years and throw them and the family out, it\u2019s so tough, Mr. Trump,\u2019\u201d he said.\u201cNo. 1, we\u2019ll say throw out. No. 2, we work with them,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Liberals who support an overhaul of the nation\u2019s immigration laws expressed horror at the spectacle of polling the audience for responses on deportations.\u201cIt\u2019s not a small issue. It\u2019s 11 million people,\u201d said Angie Kelley, the executive director of the Center for American Progress Action Fund. \u201cHe\u2019s reducing a serious policy discussion to a pep-rally vote and cheering the loudest for your team. It\u2019s insulting. It\u2019s dangerous. It\u2019s unprecedented.\u201dMr. Trump has frequently dangled vague phrases suggestive of policy shifts, only to accuse the news media of having wrongly interpreted them. His remarks in the Fox News town hall were no exception: Aides insisted afterward that there had been no change in his position.On Thursday, Mr. Trump reverted to his more severe language on the subject, departing from his prepared text at a rally in New Hampshire to again promise a border wall \u2014 a line he has said he uses when he senses his audience losing energy.And in an interview on CNN taped Thursday, Mr. Trump, pressed to clarify his intentions, only muddled them, insisting he was not endorsing a path for immigrants to live legally in the United States unless they left the country first.Republicans, regardless of their views on immigration, seized on Mr. Trump\u2019s newest pronouncements on the subject as evidence of worrisome confusion or worse.Mr. Bush, in a radio interview, called Mr. Trump\u2019s shifting speech \u201cabhorrent\u201d and baffling.\u201cI don\u2019t know what to believe about a guy who doesn\u2019t believe in things,\u201d Mr. Bush said on WABC.Among immigration hard-liners, Ann Coulter, a conservative author \u2014 who is promoting a new book titled \u201cIn Trump We Trust\u201d \u2014 seemed almost apoplectic during Mr. Trump\u2019s town-hall-style event on Fox News.The Upshot\u2019s presidential forecast, updated daily.In her book, Ms. Coulter writes that the only unforgivable sin Mr. Trump could commit would be to shift on immigration.A Trump spokeswoman, Katrina Pierson, insisted on CNN that Mr. Trump was merely changing the \u201cwords\u201d he was using, not the proposals themselves.Democrats and immigration-overhaul advocates, in fact, made the same point.\u201cDetails matter, and we have seen no actual policy shift to date,\u201d said Todd Schulte, the president of FWD.us, an immigration overhaul group backed by the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg that has been sharply critical of Mr. Trump.Several Republican strategists said Mr. Trump had waited too long to try to woo nonwhite voters, if that was his aim. But Mr. Ayres, the pollster, suggested that Mr. Trump could gain ground with white Republican moderates repelled by the idea of voting for someone who is often accused of running a racist campaign \u2014 or, given his statements questioning the impartiality of a federal judge who is Mexican-American, of being a racist himself.Still, some Republicans privately questioned why, instead of shifting the discussion of immigration to economic concerns, which polls show is a dominant issue in the election, Mr. Trump has continued to draw attention to his detractors\u2019 claims that he is a bigot.Mr. Trump has struggled to hit on a successful message on immigration for the November election, in which he will face voters far less receptive to his uncompromising proposals than those in the primary season. A poll by the Pew Research Center, conducted Aug. 9 through 16, found that while 91 percent of strong Trump supporters advocate building the wall, 61 percent of Americans are against it.Mr. Trump\u2019s aides have said he will give a speech on immigration next week in Arizona \u2014 an address originally set for this week but delayed as he grappled with precisely what he would say.Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion that he would deport only \u201cthe bad ones\u201d while letting law-abiding undocumented immigrants stay is quite similar to the approach announced by Mr. Obama in November 2014, when he directed the Department of Homeland Security to prioritize its immigration enforcement on violent criminals and people who have crossed the border illegally multiple times.His statement about payment of \u201cback taxes\u201d is also very similar to the president\u2019s \u201cdeferred action\u201d proposals, which would have required millions of immigrants in the country illegally to pay taxes, among other things, in exchange for legal protections.At the White House, officials who have spent years trying to find ways to overhaul the nation\u2019s immigration system declined to be drawn into an examination of Mr. Trump\u2019s latest comments.Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said Thursday that the challenge for American voters as they considered the immigration positions of the two presidential candidates \u201cis to listen carefully to the promises, agenda and priorities, as articulated by the two candidates.\u201dMr. Earnest declined to say which of Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration positions he believed voters should consider.\u201cThat\u2019s what makes that question more difficult than it otherwise would be,\u201d Mr. Earnest said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Want to Own a Newspaper? A Vermont Contest Has Trouble Finding Takers", "Date": "2016-08-25", "News": "Supported byHARDWICK, Vt. \u2014 Like most people who work for small newspapers, Vanessa Fournier wears many hats.A photographer, she shoots pictures for The Hardwick Gazette, the weekly broadsheet that has been documenting life here in Vermont\u2019s hardscrabble Northeast Kingdom since 1889. On Wednesdays, she is the paper\u2019s local distributor. With bundles of the freshly printed Gazette tucked into the trunk of her Honda Civic, Ms. Fournier, 61, makes her way through town, plunking down papers on countertops, slipping them into wire racks and keeping up a cheerful patter with shopkeepers.Now, she worries that both jobs could end.Unfortunately for him, the contest has not generated the interest that he had hoped would make his plan financially viable. So he has extended the deadline to Sept. 20 from Aug. 11.When asked if he had a Plan C if he had still not received enough entries in a month, he offered a blunt analogy: He could extend the deadline again, he said, but that would be \u201clike pounding your thumb with a hammer \u2014 it\u2019s not going to stop hurting.\u201dThat could sum up the newspaper business these days, at least for many big dailies, which have been upended by the internet and are in a frantic race to reinvent themselves to stay relevant in today\u2019s crowded and fragmented news media environment. The New England landscape is dotted with papers of significant lineage, many of them going through upheavals in ownership as they struggle to survive.But, Mr. Benton cautioned, the ad base can dry up, especially in the era of Amazon and big-box stores.The Gazette has been operating for 127 years, growing along with the town\u2019s granite industry. Work at the quarries peaked in 1910, as did Hardwick\u2019s population, hitting 3,200. The town then retrenched as it returned to its agricultural roots.Mr. Connelly, a trim man with close-cropped white hair and a steady gaze, who has carved out a small sitting space in front of piles of paper on his overstuffed wooden desk, has been the Gazette\u2019s steward for three decades. He is determined to find someone to whom to pass the torch.But when the contest closed Aug. 11, he had not received the 700 essays that he said was the minimum needed to make the contest financially viable. He would not say how many he had received, nor would he share the contents of the entries, saying he did not want to skew the judging.He did say that the paper, which has a paid circulation of 2,200, grossed $240,000 last year. He had figured that, with a contest entry fee of $175, 700 essays would yield enough, $122,500, to cover the Gazette building, computers and taxes and send him on his glide to retirement.He has a few guesses about why not enough entries materialized.\u201cMaybe the people who have experience know that you\u2019re not going to get rich and you\u2019re going to work your butt off,\u201d he said. \u201cThe hours are long and the pay is not great, and so they were smart enough to say, \u2018I don\u2019t want any part of this.\u2019\u201d\u201cAnd,\u201d he added, \u201cthere\u2019s a generation and a half now of people who don\u2019t even know what a newspaper is.\u201dWhat it is not, he said, is social media. \u201cFor someone to hold up a Facebook post as journalism is kind of an affront,\u201d he said.Journalism at The Gazette consists of keeping track of local government and the goings on here and in a few surrounding towns: With milk prices falling, for example, dairy farmers are banding together to increase their clout. The nearby town of Craftsbury, a Gazette reporter wrote, is \u201cjoining the 21st century\u201d with high-speed internet.Mr. Connelly says that he has also covered topics that some readers objected to, including a big bank scandal involving a local resident and the harassment of a transgender police officer by a town official.The paper, running 10 or 12 pages, is filled with the staples of community weeklies: local sports, calendars, birth announcements and obituaries, the police blotter and reviews of artistic endeavors. In last week\u2019s edition, one correspondent, Michael Bielawski, wrote five of the seven front-page stories.\u201cYou have to keep going back and become a familiar face to them, and then they begin to understand that we\u2019re a local business just like they are,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you have to spend four hours to get two ads, that\u2019s what you do.\u201dMr. Connelly takes a dim view of the headphone-wearing, phone-obsessed, plugged-in culture. So it is little surprise that The Gazette has avoided being available online.\u201cI don\u2019t believe in giving away my product,\u201d Mr. Connelly said. \u201cThat was one of the big mistakes newspapers made, because now you have people thinking it\u2019s free.\u201dIn his view, the hard copy of the paper fosters civic engagement in a way that a smartphone does not.\u201cWhen you pick up your paper, you may see a headline or a photograph that will grab your attention, and you\u2019ll say to the cashier or the person next to you, \u2018Did you see that?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt brings people together.

{"Headline": "For Wedding Photography, Some Couples Eschew a Pro in Favor of GoPro", "Date": "2016-08-27", "News": "Supported byGuests at weddings this summer may no longer be surprised by the couple\u2019s casual manner of dress, or by the circle of food trucks in place of formally catered seated dinners, or even by the fact that an old high school pal of the groom has been ordained online and enlisted as the officiant.It is the lack of another expected element \u2014 a professional wedding photographer, multiple cameras swinging from his or her neck \u2014 that may surprise some attendees.Surprising, because those same guests are now being asked to put down their drinks and start clicking away with their cellphone cameras.In a move to save money and contribute to the \u201cwinging it\u201d feel, a handful of couples are relying on relatives and friends \u2014 their pockets and purses jammed with GoPro cameras, cellphones and mini iPads \u2014 to capture the bride taking that nervous breath before she walks down the aisle or the groom hugging his father, tears in their eyes.\u201cTwo years ago, this was a conversation you never would have had,\u201d said David Tutera, a celebrity wedding planner and the host of the TV show \u201cDavid Tutera\u2019s Celebrations.\u201dFew are likely to miss the photo assistants holding large reflectors and shouting, \u201cLook here!\u201d But the more casual approach to capturing important wedding moments has had mixed results.\u201cEveryone we know has an iPhone, and most take beautiful pictures on Instagram, so we knew they\u2019d be fine,\u201d said Samantha Resnik, 33, whose wedding to Mark Edmunds, 43, included a large reception on May 21 at the West End Hall, on upper Broadway. A single photographer, she said, cannot be everywhere at once. \u201cHe can\u2019t possibly capture what 175 guests can,\u201d Ms. Resnik said.In addition to asking guests to use hashtags on Facebook or Instagram to post photos, couples are now relying solely on them to tell a visual story. \u201cWe wanted friends and family to share the moments we ourselves were not present for,\u201d Ms. Resnik said.Jessica Lawrence, 31, and Scott Maldonado, 40, were on a tight budget for their July 30 ceremony at the Maldonado family\u2019s home in New Hampshire. So they asked their friend Nas Siqueira to capture their day.\u201cWe know Nas and trust her,\u201d said the bride, now Mrs. Maldonado. \u201cWe wanted candid shots, not cheesy ones that seemed posed or inauthentic.\u201dNot everyone thinks relying on friends to record the big day is a good idea. \u201cAn expert knows what to look for,\u201d Mr. Tutera said, a perspective echoed by Jono Waks, the owner of an event planning business in Manhattan bearing his name.\u201cAside from the fact that someone\u2019s head will be cut off or someone might be cropped out accidentally, you want a dedicated professional there to ensure you get all of the memories and photos you want,\u201d Mr. Waks said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a lot of pressure to ask guests to take pictures.\u201dTo woo couples who may be thinking of forgoing a professional, some who make their living photographing weddings are offering packages that no friend can match: images from the engagement party and rehearsal dinner, DVDs, bound albums and photo thank-you cards.During big wedding moments, even professional photographers find that cellphone-snapping guests who thrust their devices into the air are impossible to avoid. \u201cThe reality is you\u2019re going to have as many phones as there are pews,\u201d said Brian Dorsey, a wedding photographer whose packages start at $7,400 and can go as high as $50,000. \u201cYou can crop out as much as possible, but their presence is a statement of where we are today. It defines the time.\u201dMr. Dorsey also admitted that some guests may capture a moment better than expected. \u201cThough smartphones haven\u2019t impacted the hiring of photographers, because people see the difference in hiring a professional as opposed to a guest, many more people are taking photos, and they are taking good ones,\u201d he said.At the Resnik-Edmunds reception, Mike Schoenfeld, a college friend, took the prize shot. \u201cMark and I stepped outside for a moment to take a breath,\u201d Ms. Resnik said. \u201cIt was raining and we were standing under the awning and he snapped this really beautiful picture of us, which I\u2019m not sure a photographer would have taken or caught.\u201dAdvertisement"}

People already tend to distrust politicians, and it\u2019s even harder to project an authentic self on social media. On top of that, people think of Mrs. Clinton as calculating and untrustworthy. How can someone like that sound like a real person online?Mrs. Clinton\u2019s legion of online content producers have been hard at work, putting together video clips and writing listicles to expand the former first lady and secretary of state\u2019s bona fides.

{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Support Among Republican Women Starts to Slide", "Date": "2016-08-09", "News": "Supported byOf all the tribulations facing Donald J. Trump, perhaps none is stirring as much anxiety inside his campaign as the precipitous decline of support from Republican women, an electoral cornerstone for the party\u2019s past nominees that is starting to crumble.In a striking series of defections, high-profile Republican women are abandoning decades of party loyalty and vowing to oppose Mr. Trump, calling him emotionally unfit for the presidency and a menace to national security.\u201cFor people like me, who are Republican but reasonable and still have our brains attached, it\u2019s hard to see Trump as a reasonable, sane Republican,\u201d said Dina Vela, a project manager in San Antonio who said she had always voted Republican and remained wary of Hillary Clinton. But to her own surprise, she has started visiting Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign website and plans to vote for her.Since the two parties held their nominating conventions, Mr. Trump\u2019s lead over Mrs. Clinton with Republican women voters has declined by 13 percentage points, according to polls conducted by The New York Times and CBS News.In late July, 72 percent of Republican women said they would vote for Mr. Trump, a healthy majority, but far below the level won by the past three Republican presidential nominees. In 2012, Mitt Romney won 93 percent of Republican women. In 2008, John McCain won 89 percent, and four years earlier, George W. Bush won 93 percent.Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, said that Mr. Trump\u2019s divisive and combative tactics, which seem to have intensified since he secured the Republican nomination, were amplified in the eyes and ears of the nation\u2019s female voters.\u201cThat kind of rhetoric is inflammatory, and I think we are seeing that women in particular have a real problem with it,\u201d Ms. Walsh said.Alarm over Mr. Trump\u2019s temperament crosses demographic lines. But decades of social science research about gender and politics suggests that women have a unique perspective on government and its leaders that frequently diverges from men\u2019s \u2014 a view, Ms. Walsh said, grounded in their longer life expectancy, their lower pay and their expectation that government will play a meaningful role in their lives.This dynamic, she said, is reflected in the number of women who vote. Four years ago, about 10 million more women voted than men, the Rutgers center found.For Mrs. Clinton, the alienation of Republican women from Mr. Trump creates a rare opportunity to capture a coveted demographic. But it poses a dilemma as well.Skeptical liberals are already looking for signs of betrayal from Mrs. Clinton, making it dangerous for her to make overt or ideological appeals to Republican women. Instead, she is making her case to them by emphasizing kitchen-table issues like job creation and by raising doubts about Mr. Trump\u2019s temperament.Tellingly, her campaign recently released a commercial in eight swing states aimed at mothers. The ad, which featured cross-legged children watching Mr. Trump\u2019s most controversial statements on their home televisions, ominously asked: \u201cOur children are watching. What example will we set for them?\u201dDemocrats acknowledge that, in the end, Mr. Trump may repel Republican women as much as Mrs. Clinton attracts them.\u201cI really think it\u2019s fueled by an anti-Trump vote,\u201d said Tracy Sefl, a Democratic strategist. \u201cBut that\u2019s fine with me, and I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s fine with the campaign.\u201dBut not all those fleeing Mr. Trump are ready to embrace Mrs. Clinton. In interviews, several Republican women, and those who lean Republican, sounded anguished by their choice: frightened by Mr. Trump, but still uncomfortable with Mrs. Clinton.\u201cI just don\u2019t trust him,\u201d said Laura Schrock, a Delaware resident who said she had voted Republican in the last two presidential elections. A Clinton skeptic, she is prepared to vote for Gary Johnson, who is running as a Libertarian.Republican pollsters have long relied on a simple benchmark for their presidential candidates: They must win at least 90 percent of Republicans to capture the White House. But with some polls showing Mr. Trump struggling to attract even 75 percent of Republican women, that could prove an impossible task.\u201cIt\u2019s an unusually poor showing,\u201d said Whit Ayres, a pollster who worked for Marco Rubio\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cThere are not enough men to counterbalance it.\u201d\u201cWhat Trump is doing has never been done before: He is losing college-educated white women,\u201d said Stuart Stevens, Mr. Romney\u2019s chief strategist in 2012 and a critic of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.The danger for Mr. Trump is that the erosion could accelerate as leading Republican women publicly break with him, making an argument that the national interest must supersede party loyalty.\u201cWe\u2019re Republicans, she\u2019s a Democrat, but the policy disagreements we have are far outweighed by the danger that Donald Trump poses to America,\u201d said Jennifer Pierotti Lim, a lifelong Republican and an executive at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce who has pledged her support to Mrs. Clinton and spoke at the Democratic National Convention.\u201cThis Republican is with her, too \u2014 thank you, as always, for your leadership, Meg!\u201d a woman named Wendy Jones wrote on Ms. Whitman\u2019s Facebook page.Of course, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign rallies still teem with women, and plenty of female Republicans remain devoted to his candidacy, convinced that his presidency would improve their lives and baffled by the defections of party leaders.Elizabeth Gonzalez, a Trump supporter who lives in North Carolina, questioned the motives of the Republican women who are now speaking out against him.\u201cThey probably feel threatened because he\u2019s an outsider,\u201d she said.An article on Wednesday about the erosion of support among Republican women for Donald J. Trump misidentified a Republican voter who said she did not trust the Republican nominee but would not vote for Hillary Clinton either. The comment was made by Laura Schrock of Delaware, not by Carol Hillenbrand of New York. (Ms. Hillenbrand, a Republican, says she will support Mrs. Clinton.)Nick Corasaniti and Megan Thee-Brenan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Duo Makes Video Calling Between Operating Systems Easier", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixGoogle and Apple have battled each other for years for primacy over mobile users. Apple has proferred its superior devices, like the iPhone. Google has fought back with its Android operating system and a series of mobile apps that are more flexible and compatible with a broader set of devices than Apple\u2019s apps.The app fits squarely into Google\u2019s playbook in mobile. Over the last few years, Google has increasingly offered its important software and internet services, including Google Maps, Google Photos and Google Docs, to iPhone customers. All of those apps were compelling alternatives to Apple\u2019s proprietary apps, like Apple Maps, Photos and Notes, because they work on a wider variety of devices, including Macs, Windows PCs, Android devices and iPhones.Duo is no exception. People can only use FaceTime to call others who have Apple devices. But Duo lets you place video calls between Android and iPhone users, and sizably increases the universe of people with whom you can hold a video conversation.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to worry about whether your call will connect, or if your friend is using the same type of device as you are,\u201d Google said in a statement, in a veiled jab at Apple. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder that nearly half of U.S. adults never make video calls on mobile.\u201dAll of this feeds into Google\u2019s strategy to attract iPhone users over to Android. Google\u2019s apps generally work better on Android devices than on iPhones, so the more that people get hooked on Google\u2019s core apps, the less incentive there is to stay loyal to Apple.Nick Fox, Google\u2019s head of communication products, said the top priority with Duo was to build a great product and to increase the use of video calling among Android users. But he added that making Android more attractive to iPhone owners was a secondary motive. He said that Duo\u2019s appeal was that it was simple to use, fast and more widely accessible.\u201cOur view is video calling should work for everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can only call half the people you know, that\u2019s very limiting.\u201d\u201cOur year-to-date iPhone sales to switchers are the greatest we\u2019ve seen in any nine-month period,\u201d Mr. Cook said in the call, without disclosing precise figures.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment beyond Mr. Cook\u2019s comments.I decided to test Duo to see how the new app plays into the debate about whether iPhone users should consider switching to Android devices. After trying an early copy of Duo and comparing it side by side with FaceTime, I found that Duo was just as intuitive and fun to use as FaceTime, but that it was too early to tell which service was more reliable.A Short HistoryThis is not the first time Google has provided video calling. Google started offering mobile video calling several years ago inside its Hangouts app, which also includes messaging and voice-calling capabilities. The video-calling feature in Hangouts will remain intact.Crystal Dahlen, a Google spokeswoman, said the name Duo conveyed that the app was designed for one-to-one video calling on mobile devices, in contrast to Hangouts, which lets groups of people make video calls over mobile devices and computers. Duo will roll out globally over the next few days.FaceTime, in contrast, is now six years old. When Apple unveiled the video-calling ability in iPhones in 2010, Steven P. Jobs, Apple\u2019s co-founder, said he had dreamed of mobile video calling since he grew up watching \u201cThe Jetsons\u201d and \u201cStar Trek.\u201d Apple later expanded FaceTime to work with iPads and Macs, among other Apple products. The company has not published statistics on FaceTime use, but the technology helped make mobile video calling mainstream.Duo Versus FaceTimeThe Duo app is downloadable and free through Google\u2019s Play store and Apple\u2019s App Store. When you open the Duo app, there is just one button: video call. Tapping that loads your contacts list, and from there you can choose whom to call.Duo starts streaming video to a recipient as soon as the call is placed, meaning the person you are calling will be able to see you waving or making faces before he or she picks up. Google calls this feature Knock Knock. It can be disabled in case you have friends who are likely to make inappropriate hand gestures.With FaceTime, you place a call directly through the iPhone\u2019s contacts list or through the separate FaceTime app. The recipient does not see the video streaming until after the call is answered.I placed video calls over Duo and FaceTime over a strong Wi-Fi connection as well as a weak cellular connection. In the tests, the video calls looked clearer on Duo, though that is an unreliable measure because very few people are currently able to use Duo, so the network is unrealistically uncongested. When more people use Duo, we can expect the picture quality to vary depending on network traffic and internet speeds.There is a minor difference for Duo between Android and iPhone users. An Android user receiving a Duo call will see a Knock Knock video on the home screen by default. Those using Apple devices will see a notification on top of the screen and will have to open the Duo app before seeing Knock Knock in action. Otherwise, the app works the same for both Android and iPhone.Against the RestI also compared Duo calls with video calls placed over Microsoft\u2019s Skype and Facebook Messenger. Against those two, Duo\u2019s simplicity won hands down.In Facebook\u2019s Messenger app, the video-calling feature is embedded in the corner of a message box, so it is hard to find and not intuitive to use. In fact, every call I have ever made with Messenger has been by mistake.On Skype, the video-calling feature is in a place similar to Messenger\u2019s, in the corner of a message box. More annoyingly, to find other Skype users you have to manually add them to your Skype contacts list or toggle on an option to synchronize your address book with Skype.The Bottom LineFor now, FaceTime is just as intuitive as Duo so I see no compelling reason to use Duo over FaceTime to call iPhone users.But if I had to video call an Android user, I would use Duo over other video-calling services like Skype or Facebook Messenger, which have more cluttered interfaces than Duo\u2019s single-button approach.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Rethinking the Use of Hormones to Ease Menopause Symptoms", "Date": "2016-08-29", "News": "Jane Brody on health and aging.Ever since the large government study called the Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Health Initiative found a number of risks associated with menopause hormones, millions of women who are in or near menopause have been weathering hot flashes and other symptoms on their own. But now, new research suggests that the benefits of short-term hormone treatment to control life-disrupting menopausal symptoms outweigh the risks \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as long as the treatment is started at or near menopause.There are also lots of products now available and different ways to use them that enhance the safety of hormone replacement. And there is even an app to help women and their doctors explore various options and choose the most suitable treatment.For women without a history of cancer, blood clots or heart disease, most professional medical societies concerned with women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health now recommend treatment for menopausal symptoms for up to five years using therapy that combines estrogen and progesterone and even longer for those who take estrogen alone.Every day, about 6,000 women in the United States \u00e2\u0080\u0094 more than two million women a year \u00e2\u0080\u0094 enter menopause. At an average age of 51, they stop having their periods because their ovaries no longer produce enough estrogen to stimulate growth of the uterine lining that is shed each menstrual cycle.For months before and up to a decade or more after menopause begins, many women have symptoms that can seriously diminish the quality of their lives by disrupting their productivity, sleep, moods and ability to enjoy sexual intercourse.The most common symptom \u00e2\u0080\u0094 hot flashes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 can leave some women dripping with sweat for minutes at a time several times a day and especially during the night. Menopause-related vaginal dryness and atrophy can result in severe sexual discomfort, pain and bleeding with exercise, vaginal and urinary infections and incontinence.Until the early 2000s, many women with menopausal symptoms took hormone replacement therapy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 H.R.T. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to counter them. Even some who did not have disturbing symptoms used H.R.T. because observational studies indicated it lowered the risk of cardiovascular diseases, and popular books and articles suggested it delayed signs of aging.The study found that, among the women treated with the hormones, there was an increased risk of heart attacks, strokes, blood clots and, most frightening of all to many women, a slightly higher risk of breast cancer among those randomized to take the leading H.R.T. regimen of conjugated equine estrogens (Premarin) and a synthetic progesterone (Provera) recommended for women who still had a uterus. (Those without a uterus, who were randomized to take conjugated estrogens alone, had no increase in breast cancer; in fact, they had a slight decrease over all.)The hormone combination did protect against hip fractures and reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, but for the overwhelming majority of menopausal women, the risks of H.R.T. seemed \u00e2\u0080\u0094 on the surface \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to outweigh the benefits.However, according to Dr. JoAnn E. Manson, an endocrinologist and one of the principal investigators for the W.H.I., \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe W.H.I. findings have been seriously misunderstood and misinterpreted,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and millions of women for whom the benefits clearly outweigh the risks are needlessly being denied treatment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe pendulum has swung too far,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.The W.H.I. study actually had nothing to do with menopausal symptoms. Most of the 27,347 women entering the study were already in their 60s and 70s, already a decade or more past menopause. Rather, the study was designed to determine whether H.R.T. did, in fact, reduce the risk of heart disease, the leading killer of American women. Among these older women, it found no such effect.Experts like Dr. Manson, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham & Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hospital, maintain that the results of the W.H.I. study are not relevant to the more common use of H.R.T. for women in their 50s and for those experiencing earlier menopause as a result of medical treatments.Dr. Howard N. Hodis, a preventive cardiologist at the University of Southern California, said the billion-dollar W.H.I. study made \u00e2\u0080\u009ca big mistake\u00e2\u0080\u009d by starting the hormones in older women, when cardiovascular damage may have already occurred. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe cardiovascular protection found in observational studies involved women who were younger and within a few years of menopause when they started taking H.R.T.,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.Dr. Hodis is especially disturbed about the reluctance to prescribe estrogens for menopausal women who have had a hysterectomy and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need progesterone to prevent endometrial cancer.Dr. Manson is distressed about the large number of women \u00e2\u0080\u0094 about a third of those now on hormone replacement \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who are relying on \u00e2\u0080\u009ccustom-compounded\u00e2\u0080\u009d products that have not been reviewed for safety and effectiveness by the Food and Drug Administration. They come with no warnings in a package insert and could contain contaminants and inconsistent dosages, she said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little or no reason to go the custom-compound route,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWomen today have so many options \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a wide array of doses, from low to traditional, and ways to use them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In addition to pills, there are patches, gels and sprays applied to the skin. Vaginal and urinary symptoms can be treated with vaginal inserts containing very small amounts of estrogen that do not enter the bloodstream and thus are safe for women who have had breast cancer.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

But their nearly two years of marriage had been punctuated by the killings of African-American men and boys in Ferguson, Mo.; Brooklyn; Cleveland; North Charleston, S.C.; and Baltimore, all at the hands of the police. Mr. Janu, who longed for a son, tried to reassure his wife. Mrs. Janu emailed him one article after another, warning of the perils that face black boys.As the due date approached, Mr. Janu found himself praying for a girl.In the delivery room at St. Agnes Hospital, after more than 20 hours of labor, the infant finally arrived, red-faced and wailing. The newborn had Mr. Janu\u2019s blue eyes and Mrs. Janu\u2019s full lips and nose. The new father exulted. Then he felt the weight of his new reality.\u201cNow, I have a black son in Baltimore,\u201d the white police detective remembered thinking as he cradled his baby boy.The violence has been wrenching for families like the Janus, an interracial couple struggling to straddle the nation\u2019s racial fault lines in a red brick rowhouse in a quiet corner of Baltimore. But the heated national discussions over policing and race feel particularly piercing for a black woman born in the South and her white husband who wears a badge.Born in Louisiana, Mrs. Janu grew up in a predominantly white suburb in upstate New York, joined a white sorority in college and married a white detective. Yet these days, she fears that racism and bias might be \u201chard-wired\u201d into society and wonders how that might affect her family.She worries as her husband holsters his Glock 22, kisses her goodbye and heads out the door to pursue gun runners and violent criminals in this predominantly black city. Will he be a target now on the street?She worries as she has adjusted to the rhythms of round-the-clock feedings and diaper changes. What dangers might Wesley face as a teenager at the hands of the police?And then there is the racial divide that runs right through her living room, the issues that occasionally create a rift between husband and wife. Mrs. Janu, 31, is a strong supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement, for instance, while Mr. Janu, 42, argues that some of its activists \u201cdo more harm than good\u201d and spew \u201ca lot of hate\u201d toward the police.\u201cAm I being a disloyal law enforcement wife because I do feel so strongly for Black Lives Matter, because I do feel such a strong affinity for the movement?\u201d asked Mrs. Janu, describing her internal turmoil during 12 weeks of maternity leave.\u201cI try to see both sides of it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt leaves me a little bit torn.\u201dThe warnings flashed on Mr. Janu\u2019s cellphone after nightfall on July 7 as he cruised through downtown Baltimore in his unmarked police car. It was his first inkling that a calamity was unfolding.\u201cWatch your back,\u201d one friend texted.\u201cBe safe out there,\u201d another wrote.At home, Mrs. Janu was trying to erase the image of a dying black man from her mind. She had delighted that day in one of Wesley\u2019s milestones, when she realized he was following her every move with his eyes, and recorded the thrill in an app tracking his development.Mrs. Janu scrambled to press the pause button, but she had already seen too much. She sat stunned on the sofa, with Wesley in her arms, reliving her fears about his future.\u201cAll I wanted to do was hug her,\u201d he said.The couple met six years ago, casually introduced by mutual friends who were shocked when they got together. Mrs. Janu, who is wry and bracingly frank, had vowed never to date a police officer. She had grown up hearing her parents\u2019 stories about ugly encounters between African-Americans and the police in the segregated South.She remembers the day her father was pulled over. She was 7 at the time, sitting in the back seat. And she still remembers the pains he took afterward \u2014 checking and rechecking his turn lights and headlights \u2014 to ensure that it would never happen again. \u201cBullies,\u201d she said, matter-of-factly describing the men she assumed joined the force.Mr. Janu, who is stocky, bald and bearded, looked like a character in a television crime drama. He had spent a decade in the military and a decade on the police force, mostly in a specialized squad that focused on gun sales and gun offenders.But he was unlike any officer she had encountered. He was silly and cracked her up. He had studied marine biology in college, loved travel and art and shared her nostalgia for \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer,\u201d the cult television series. (The Janus named their son and one of their dogs, Buffy, a Maltese poodle mix, after characters in the show.)His father, who abhors interracial relationships, stopped speaking to him. Mr. Janu was undeterred by his disapproval, and by the stream of news articles and blog posts that Mrs. Janu emailed him, warning about the challenges facing interracial couples and parents of biracial children.But the pain still surfaces. A year ago, Mr. Janu bumped into his father while he was visiting family near Cleveland. His father stood up without speaking, strode to his white convertible and locked the door. Mr. Janu chased after him, pounding his fists on the car windows.\u201cWhy won\u2019t you talk to me?\u201d he remembered shouting before his father drove off.Sometimes, the Janus manage to put that aside, the knowledge that their son might never meet his paternal grandfather, and their fears about what he might face as a young man.They lose themselves in the cocoon of their two-story home, shouting out answers to the contestants on \u201cFamily Feud,\u201d chatting about the summer electric bill, the paperwork for day care and their perennial efforts to prod Wesley to nap just a little bit longer, which most recently involved the purchase of an outfit called \u201cBaby Merlin\u2019s Magic Sleepsuit.\u201dThey focus on Wesley \u2014 Mr. Janu calls him \u201cLittle Man\u201d \u2014 on the grip of his fingers, the pout of his lower lip, the way he scales tall buildings with his eyes. \u201cI think he wants to climb them,\u201d joked his father, who envisions his boy hurling a football and sliding into home plate.But this summer, the ugliness of the outside world has always seemed to intrude.Just days after the Dallas shootings, one of Mr. Janu\u2019s colleagues, an officer who had attended his wedding, narrowly escaped a spray of gunfire. Some in the department worried initially that the assailant had intended to ambush the police.\u201cThere\u2019s going to be rioting \u2014 is that what you\u2019re saying?\u201d asked Mrs. Janu, her phone tight to her ear, as she bounced Wesley on her hip.Mrs. Janu considers herself the no-nonsense, practical parent, but the list fills her with sadness. \u201cBlack boys aren\u2019t allowed to be innocent or young,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have that privilege.\u201dMr. Janu felt bewildered at first by such talk. He is the optimist in the family, the dreamer. He had never imagined such a discussion with his son. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have to explain that to a white child,\u201d he said.He said he had lived most of his life \u201cwith blinders on.\u201d His conversations with his wife have opened his eyes.In the past, Mr. Janu said, he often assumed that the black boys he saw on impoverished street corners were criminals-to-be, youngsters destined for handcuffs. Now, he looks for the exuberance in the faces of the wisecracking, jostling boys still savoring the waning days of summer.He hopes that other police officers will see that, too, someday, in his son.Follow Rachel Swarns @rachelswarns on Twitter.Advertisement"}

In an era when dance has exploded thanks to social media, Ms. Miranda wanted to share her dance moves, unfiltered, with the rest of the world.So in 2014, she hired a videographer to tape her dance studio in the North Hollywood neighborhood of Los Angeles, with students performing her signature moves, blending hip-hop swagger with a gymnastic breakneck pace.Such attention has turned Ms. Miranda into a budding celebrity, with strangers coming up to her at hotels, grocery stores, restaurants and on the street. \u201cI had a waiter recently cry when he met me,\u201d she said. \u201cHe politely asked me for a picture and got emotional because I have inspired him so much.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been a dance instructor for 15 years,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t until I got big on YouTube that I started getting this much attention.\u201dNot since Paula Abdul, a dancer who went on to become a pop and TV personality, has the role of the choreographer been so appreciated in popular culture. \u201cDancing is language agnostic,\u201d said Kevin Allocca, YouTube\u2019s head of culture and trends. \u201cPeople around the world can watch, learn and upload their own moves.\u201dVideo-sharing platforms like YouTube, Vine and Snapchat have not only expanded the reach of seasoned choreographers like Ms. Miranda, they have also turned choreographers of all kinds, who traditionally toil behind the scenes, into stars in their own right.Born in Arizona, Ms. Miranda started ballet and tap at age 4. By 19, she was teaching hip-hop classes. She moved to Los Angeles in 2001 to be closer to the action, and she made ends meet as a waitress and as a dance instructor at Gold\u2019s Gym.Her big break came in 2004, when her agent tipped her off that Beyonc\u00e9 was looking for a backup dancer for her Ladies First Tour. \u201cI was a hostess at the time when they called me to tell me I got the gig,\u201d she said. \u201cI immediately took off my apron, turned to my manager and said: \u2018I\u2019m going on tour with Beyonc\u00e9.

One small slip, a brief lapse of attention, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re history.But is it really just about chasing an adrenaline rush? And are these action sports as dangerous to devoted participants as they seem on television and in YouTube videos?Even watching the recent gruesome footage of the French Olympic gymnast Samir Ait Said, who broke his leg in Rio during a vault landing, can make one wonder whether it is wise to pursue even so \u00e2\u0080\u009ctame\u00e2\u0080\u009d an activity as gymnastics.The derring-do of Olympic competitors and the death in an avalanche in July of Matilda Rapaport, a Swedish extreme skier, while being filmed in the Andes, prompted me to look more closely at why so many people choose to try these sports, how dangerous they are and how hazards can be minimized.There are no reliable statistics to inform a potential participant of the risks of any sport, even everyday activities school children and amateur and professional athletes engage in, like soccer, skateboarding, basketball and football. While individual injuries and deaths are well publicized, there are no data to show how likely these are.Second, the motivations offered by extreme sports participants for why they are so willing to assume the risks involved are not what you might expect. Adventure sports are not \u00e2\u0080\u009can outlet for \u00e2\u0080\u0098crazy\u00e2\u0080\u0099 individuals with an unhealthy relationship to fear, who are pathological in their search for risk or living out a death wish,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Brymer and his colleague at Queensland University, Robert Schweitzer, wrote.Yes, at first, having survived an attempt or two is exhilarating, and the emotional high (which, by the way, results from dopamine release in the brain, not adrenaline) prompts them to come back for more.Nor is it that extreme sports participants lack fear. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFear is an essential element to their survival,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Brymer and Dr. Schweitzer explained. In interviews with extreme athletes, they and other researchers have learned that participants consider fear \u00e2\u0080\u009ca healthy, productive experience,\u00e2\u0080\u009d prompting them to take appropriate precautions that enhance the chances of surviving uninjured.As one solo rope-free mountain climber told the researchers, , \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I panic, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m lost, dead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He learned to thwart panic and instead stay relaxed and focused, maintaining clarity and good judgment that help to protect him.Through interviews with many regular extreme sports participants, researchers have found that the emotional high becomes less and less important with time. As participants continue to pursue the activities, other motives and perceived benefits to health and well-being take precedence.Devoted extreme sport participants regard safety as their highest priority. They learn the skills needed for their chosen sport, they train to become sufficiently expert at it and to know how to judge the extent of their ability, said Dr. Vani Sabesan, an orthopedic surgeon at Western Michigan University School of Medicine.\u00e2\u0080\u009cSomeone with medical expertise should be present to make sure you have the right protective gear and to rescue you if something goes wrong,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.Susan McGowen, an athletic trainer at the University of New Mexico College of Education, who provided such oversight for a dozen years at the X-Games, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust because you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen it on TV or YouTube, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t assume anybody can go out and try to duplicate the feats of extreme athletes. It takes years and years of practice and progress to get to those levels.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDr. McGowen emphasized the importance of having an athletic trainer present at all organized activities \u00e2\u0080\u0094 school and youth leagues as well as amateur and professional games, who can enhance safety through proper nutrition, well-maintained equipment and good coaching, as well as properly care for an injured athlete.Such guidance is especially important for people planning to participate in an extreme sport. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople are terrible judges of risk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d David O.

{"Headline": "How a Suicide Bomber Made His Way From Syria to Strike in Ansbach, Germany", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMUNICH \u2014 To the German authorities, he was Mohammad Daleel, a 27-year-old Syrian traumatized by war who arrived in Europe seeking refuge.To the Islamic State, he was Abu Yousef, a jihadist who went to Europe for medical treatment after being wounded, intending to return to battle.That fact has raised troubling questions about the refugee policies of Chancellor Angela Merkel as Germany works to integrate nearly a million migrants and she faces calls for a firmer approach, led by a surging far right.Even before the recent spate of attacks by refugees, the German authorities and others in Europe were concerned about infiltration by terrorists. But Mr. Daleel\u2019s case has brought home to Germans the danger of former fighters, from any of the numerous sides in Syria\u2019s multicornered conflict, who have arrived along with civilians.As he sought asylum in Europe, Mr. Daleel appears to have either embellished or omitted key parts of his history in constantly shifting accounts.\u201cBased on what we know right now, it is not clear when he radicalized,\u201d Joachim Herrmann, interior minister for Bavaria, said this week. \u201cThere is the possibility that he self-radicalized; there is a possibility that he was radicalized a long time ago, perhaps even years ago.\u201dDocuments show that Mr. Daleel entered Europe illegally in July 2013 through Bulgaria, where he arrived with a Sony Xperia mobile phone and charger, two two-gigabyte memory cards, two sets of earbuds, a one-gigabyte flash drive and eight $100 bills.One of the people Mr. Daleel turned to for help when he arrived in Europe was Iliana Savova, director of the program for legal protection of refugees and migrants at the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee, a human-rights organization. In her office in Sofia, Bulgaria, she confirmed that Mr. Daleel was one of 290 asylum seekers who had appealed to the organization for help in November 2013. Mr. Daleel told the organization that he had no money and nowhere to live, and that he required medical treatment for his knee.\u201cI particularly remember this case because we don\u2019t see people with shell fragments in their legs very often,\u201d Ms. Savova said. \u201cHe told us he got the fragments in his legs when a shell exploded in his house and killed his wife and children.\u201dA look at the lives of 247 men, women and children who were cut down in mass killings in six countries.Mr. Daleel did not claim he had been tortured during the two months he was detained in Bulgaria, as he later told the German authorities. The Bulgarian authorities said they knew of no abuse. Mr. Daleel showed them shrapnel wounds on his legs. But they noted no signs of psychological instability or indications of radicalization.Mr. Daleel was granted asylum, but was unable to get the medical treatment he sought. He then flew to Austria, where he again applied for asylum in the spring of 2014. The application was rejected because he had protection in Bulgaria.Several months later, he went on to Germany. Here, he first made the claim that he had been abused in Bulgaria to Axel von Maltitz, a therapist in the southwestern city of Lindau, who, along with his wife, Gisela, runs an association that offers counseling to victims of trauma and to refugees.The couple refused to accept the idea of Mr. Daleel as a terrorist who supported the Islamic State.\u201cHe was a very calm, very pleasant patient, without any further problems,\u201d Ms. von Maltitz said in a telephone interview. \u201cHe would always come punctually with his bicycle on the train.\u201dMr. Daleel received six sessions from her husband over the course of a year starting in January 2015, she said. He had been granted another session for the end of July, but was left on his own in the meantime.Ms. von Maltitz refused to comment on his motives. \u201cThis simply doesn\u2019t fit into the picture of the patient who we knew,\u201d she said.Last year, a German volunteer who works with refugees brought Mr. Daleel\u2019s case to the attention of a lawmaker, Harald Weinberg, who holds a seat for the Left party in the German Parliament. Mr. Weinberg wrote to the authorities in Ansbach on Nov. 15, urging them to allow Mr. Daleel to stay, saying that Mr. Daleel had been hospitalized \u201cseveral times\u201d for psychological treatment and was suicidal after being ordered to return to Bulgaria.On July 24, Mr. Daleel detonated a bomb in his backpack at the music festival, wounding 15 and killing himself.A video found on his phone showed a masked man claiming to be Mr. Daleel, but using a nom de guerre and swearing allegiance to the Islamic State. It was later also circulated by the terrorist group. Federal prosecutors took over the case because of the apparent terrorism links, although Mr. Daleel had been unknown to them before the attack.The Islamic State called Mr. Daleel a soldier, too, but in his case, it also provided a long account of his ties to the group, including as a fighter in Aleppo, Syria. Last week, the group said Mr. Daleel had first joined its ranks in Iraq and later fought in Syria, \u201cwhere he was injured by shrapnel of a mortar.\u201dAfter seeking treatment in Europe, it said, Mr. Daleel wanted to return to Syria to fight but was unable to do so, and instead \u201cstarted creating accounts\u201d on the internet to support the Islamic State.The German police say Mr. Daleel opened six Facebook accounts, at least one of which was under a false name.The Islamic State also claimed that Mr. Daleel had studied how to make a bomb for three months, was in contact with a handler and had visited the site of the attack the day before.Even before the attack, Germany had tightened laws to register and share data about newly arriving refugees. It has also been sending out teams of customs officers or soldiers to locate unregistered asylum seekers.The teams record basic personal information and country of birth, and take biometric photos and fingerprints, said Andrea Brinkmann, a spokeswoman for the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees. Those are checked against the domestic intelligence office\u2019s databases and data on refugees already registered elsewhere in the European Union. Since February, all offices dealing with refugees, from the border police to state and local officials, have been able to review that information.But whether those steps will be sufficient remains to seen. Officials and humanitarian groups say they have long tried to balance the protection of refugees against security.\u201cThe challenge, then,\u201d said Elizabeth Collett, director of the Migration Policy Institute Europe, \u201cis to find those individuals who may have had different motivations, and those whose motivations may have changed since they arrived.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Get the Most out of Visiting World-Famous Sites", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe GetawayIf you\u2019re visiting Florence, Italy, you\u2019ve got to see the world-famous Uffizi Gallery. But why? Because that\u2019s what one does in Florence? Because you feel compelled to post a selfie in front of Botticelli\u2019s \u201cBirth of Venus\u201d?Those are obviously terrible reasons. We shouldn\u2019t go to places because they\u2019re world-famous; we should go to fully appreciate the thing that made them world-famous \u2014 an unparalleled collection of Renaissance art, for example. But that requires a thoughtful, well-planned visit, not just following the masses, snapping pictures and checking it off your bucket list.I spoke with those in charge of some of the world\u2019s great attractions to glean strategies for making the most of a visit, both substantive improvements and simple beat-the-crowds techniques. Because, no matter how great the view is from the crown of Lady Liberty, you don\u2019t want to wait in a long line to get there.The ultimate way to avoid crowds is to visit during the off-season; in other words, not now. Many dismiss off-season travel as unviable because of school schedules, but remember American Thanksgiving and spring breaks (if they don\u2019t fall over Easter week) don\u2019t mirror other countries\u2019 vacations.Timed tickets can often be bought days in advance and are increasingly available at crowded attractions around the world. At the Uffizi, they cost 4 euros extra (boosting admission to 16.50 euros, about $18) and take care of waiting in line, if not the crowds.You can buy them at the official Uffizi website, uffizi.it, if you can find it. Unofficial sites that look official are rampant. They often look good and sometimes contain good information, but look out. \u201cYou can pay $30 or $40 on a fake website,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said. \u201cAnd sometimes the tickets do not exist\u201d \u2014 that is, they\u2019re fakes. Even when they\u2019re just reselling real tickets, look out for markups. For example, uffizi.com, one of the unofficial sites, charges 24.99 euros (about $27.35), and it even marks up the audio guides.Another reason to set aside more time: Visitors skip the less-famous but equally worthwhile, often beautifully complementary sites nearby.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article referred incorrectly to the availability of tickets for the Statue of Liberty. As the article correctly notes, tickets to visit the crown \u2014 not the entire monument \u2014 are sold out until early November.An article last Sunday about visiting tourist-heavy sites misstated the surname of the lead park ranger for the Statue of Liberty National Monument. As the article correctly noted elsewhere, he is Michael Amato, not Damato.Advertisement"}

The force of globalization, of nomadic humanity, of borderless cyberspace has engendered an equally strong counter-force of nationalism, nativist politics and anti-immigrant bigotry. The two trends are poised in a tense equilibrium.I lived in Brazil for several years. It is a generous country. Perhaps no other nation has such a mestizo culture, such ingrained habits of mingling. It feels right that this outreach to Team Refugees should have happened in Rio, a city of miscegenation and openness.The glorification of Team Refugees and the vilification of refugees coexist.

Living out in the fields, with what few possessions they had left in the open, they knew they could be easy prey for robbers. They looked askance at Mr. Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez at first. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey see you as a foreigner,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSome of then would say no to my taking pictures. Other said yes, but would not speak to me. Many of them don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even speak Spanish. You had to spend time with them so they could trust you. Now I have been returning so many times since 2013, I have their trust, more or less.\u00e2\u0080\u009dTheir pay \u00e2\u0080\u0094 per family, not worker \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is so meager, he said, that they forgo doctor visits rather than forgo a meal. There is no protective gear, just the same clothes they wear so much that they just discard them at season\u00e2\u0080\u0099s end.Mr. Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez is producing a multimedia piece on these workers, conducting video interviews. He also vows to continue the project to see if any change comes after years of substandard conditions. He would like to see the cigarette companies that purchase the tobacco from the plantations that employ these migrant workers flex their muscle to demand changes. He noted that British American Tobacco Mexico, which buys the tobacco picked by the Huichol, was recently named as a company where people wanted to work because of good benefits and a positive workplace culture. The company did not respond to requests for comment.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a desirable place to work,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the people who work there have those kinds of jobs thanks to the people who toil in the countryside.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

That\u2019s O.K., but honestly he doesn\u2019t even write good.Never had a problem with the press. They don\u2019t get it. I\u2019ve crashed the system. I\u2019m using the press, every one of them! Schwartz did have one phrase I really loved in my book. He said \u201cI play to people\u2019s fantasies\u201d by using \u201ctruthful hyperbole.\u201d What he meant is I make stuff up.Sure. Nobody cares. They want to dream. They want a spectacle. They want gold and towers. They want me to get tough. Fact-checkers! Is that even a job?By the way, Schwartz was surprised I asked him to write my book. He\u2019d written a negative cover story about me for New York Magazine in 1985. Give me a break! I was on the cover. That\u2019s all that matters. The surface. I stuck the cover up in my office.You know who I am. Of course you do. You can\u2019t get enough of me. The press has given me a couple of billion dollars in free publicity. Honestly. That\u2019s a good deal. People can\u2019t do without me.

Remind them you can get nasty. \u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d Terrific line.Keep your options open. Always. Consistency is dull. You think I got to be one of the richest guys in the country by being consistent?By the way, you may be wondering why I\u2019m writing this diary. I don\u2019t read books. Don\u2019t have time. I don\u2019t like planning or consultants. Or reflection. It\u2019s all gut with me. But I figure some day people may wonder how I got to be president of the United States.That\u2019s easy. I know what Americans want. They don\u2019t want truth. They want excitement, disruption. They want to be led. They want authority. They want victories. They want parades. They want a wall at the Mexican border \u2014 so let them think I really might build one! You think they\u2019re happy with Obama\u2019s managed decline? Give me a break!All I have to do in the next 96 days is make Hillary seem dull. You know, yesterday\u2019s news. Used goods. Rigged, crooked establishment. Americans want change. She\u2019s more of the same.And, honestly, she\u2019s no more honest than I am! Truth is over. Attention spans are over \u2014 and I never had one anyway. That\u2019s what the press doesn\u2019t get.That Schwartz, he was a journalist when I proposed the book. He did get one thing right. My book says: \u201cI like thinking big. I always have. To me it\u2019s very simple: If you\u2019re going to be thinking anyway, you might as well think big.\u201dThat last line sounds familiar. Maybe my daughter Ivanka borrowed it in Cleveland. But it came from my book, which, in truthful hyperbole, I wrote.Thinking big! We\u2019ve been way too predictable. What\u2019s wrong with having Denmark or even China think that if they insult me they might wake and find they\u2019ve been nuked? You\u2019ve got to maximize flexibility. And all the freeloaders out there who\u2019ve gotten used to us not using our leverage, they are going to have to think again. Personally, if Putin eats Estonia, I\u2019m not going to lose sleep over it. But I\u2019m not going public with that yet.I see that schmuck Schwartz says he\u2019d call my book \u201cThe Sociopath\u201d if he was writing it today. Not a bad idea!

{"Headline": "The Fight to Protect L.G.B.T. Students in Colombia", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "After his death, Mr. Urrego\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother, Alba Reyes, sued school officials, faulting them for ostracizing her only son after discovering that he and a classmate had an intimate relationship. A year later, Colombia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s highest court issued a sweeping ruling in her favor, calling on schools nationwide to develop clearer policies to prevent discrimination. The decision was part of a string of legal victories for Colombia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gay rights movement, which earlier this year celebrated a decision that legalized same-sex marriage. This week, though, their fight for equality hit an obstacle as Gina Parody, the minister of education \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who is openly gay \u00e2\u0080\u0094 became the flashpoint of a scandal over the implementation of the ruling. The fracas started when sexually explicit content from a pornographic magazine began circulating on social media, peddled by people who claimed it was part of a guidance manual issued by the education ministry. Ms. Parody quickly debunked that. While the ministry offered guidance to schools on issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity in an effort to help them heed the ruling, it has not sought to impose standardized rules. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat we want is for schools to have the tools to resolve conflicts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Parody said in an interview on Thursday. The dispute opened a new front in a national debate over the future of a country torn over peace negotiations between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or the FARC, a guerrilla group. Critics of the government \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the peace talks \u00e2\u0080\u0094 pounced on Ms. Parody, a 42-year-old rising star in Colombian politics. They displayed crude posters at rallies and some threatened violence against her and her partner, Cecilia \u00c3\u0081lvarez-Correa Glen, the former commerce minister. Ms. Parody remained admirably stoic throughout the bruising week as she sought to set the record straight and recast the debate on constructive terms. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPart of what has kept me standing and clear-headed is knowing that there are kids out there who are in the process of coming out of the closet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a tough stage and a very lonely time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She also drew a connection between the peace process and the debate over L.G.B.T. students. As Colombians continue to weigh the merits of a deal with the FARC, which would mark a seismic turning point for the country, they must consider the roots of the conflict, she said. \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs a peaceful country one that promotes inclusion or exclusion; is it one in which everyone has equal opportunities?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. While she takes no pleasure in having been the target of insults and harassment this week, she is glad that in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Colombia, gay students can look up to her and consider that they, too, can aspire to serve as a minister one day. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo me, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s critical that they can be at ease and that they realize that they can reach their full potential,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Parody said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wait for a new suicide to start changing.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAdvertisement"}

Facebook was a college social site before it became a global media hub; Amazon was a bookseller before it was, well, everything.Joe MacMillan (Lee Pace), a mysterious, smooth-talking drifter of a businessman, was paired with Gordon Clark (Scoot McNairy), a brilliant but failed engineer, in a sketchy scheme to bring an IBM clone to market. As a plot, it was less than inspiring, and as a character story, less than inspired: an 8-bit Don Draper and a Walter White who dealt in megabytes rather than meth.But at the end of its first season, \u201cHalt\u201d did something almost unheard-of in television, if not in tech: It upended its entire project. With the introduction of the Apple Macintosh, Joe and Gordon discovered that they had been chasing yesterday\u2019s dream. They were thinking too small, too incrementally. The quest of the entire season had been a failure of imagination.The headlines then were about computing power coming to your desktop. But the long-term change, barely glimmering in the days of telephone modems, lay in the connection of every desktop to every other. It was the birth of the social internet, where we now live.Season 2 followed Mutiny, a nascent online gaming company started by Gordon\u2019s wife, Donna (Kerry Bish\u00e9), and Cameron Howe (Mackenzie Davis), an impassioned sparkplug of a programmer.For all practical purposes, the series changed not just its focus but its lead characters. Cameron was visionary but impractical; Donna relished the new start but chafed at being forced into the role of the buzz kill adult in the room. (Ms. Bish\u00e9 gave a nuanced, undersung performance.)This was something we hadn\u2019t seen so often before: a tricky but fruitful alliance between two women in a male-dominated industry. Cameron had the digital native\u2019s instinct to see the online world as a place of constant invention. Donna had the emotional intelligence to notice that Mutiny\u2019s social component \u2014 its chat rooms \u2014 was the future of the future.Season 3, which begins on Tuesday, continues the show\u2019s iterative-learning process, picking up in 1986, as Mutiny has relocated from Texas to Silicon Valley and is beginning to reconceive itself one more time. (Cameron and Donna have noticed their gamers\u2019 taking over Mutiny chat to negotiate real-world trades \u2014 shades of Craigslist or eBay.)The growing pains continue, throwing the women into the unfamiliar and testosterone-heavy world of venture capitalists. \u201cIt only takes one of them to ask you to the dance,\u201d says their consigliere, John Bosworth (Toby Huss). Cameron replies, \u201cI love how even the metaphors in this business are sexist.\u201d They find a possible ally in Diane (Annabeth Gish), a sympathetic but bluntly honest investor.Gordon has come along in tow, feeling at loose ends in a managerial role at Mutiny. The chameleonic Joe, meanwhile, has landed in California as the head of a software-security firm, sporting a Steve Jobsian beard and speaking in pretentious koans. (\u201cI\u2019ve been accused of selling fear,\u201d he tells a rapt audience. \u201cBut let me ask you: Is it fear or is it truth?\u201d)Joe\u2019s re-reinvention as a smug tech guru suits Mr. Pace, a striking but peculiar presence whom the show has struggled to use effectively. (He was well cast in the \u201cHobbit\u201d movies as the frosty, Eurotrash-y elven king Thranduil.) He seems fully at home now, strutting around his office listening to Gary Numan music, carrying himself like a human Patrick Nagel print.The new season takes time to reset, and the movement in the early episodes is slow. The character dynamics are solid, though, and the \u201980s details continue to be spot on. (At a fancy Valley restaurant, Donna stumbles over the pronunciation of a trendy new dish: risotto.)But any well-produced period piece can recreate bygone days. \u201cHalt\u201d lets you see them as the cusp of bracing change.

{"Headline": "\u2018The Night Of\u2019 Season 1, Episode 6: The Cat or the Yarn?", "Date": "2016-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Night OfFor now, though, \u201cThe Night Of\u201d has to be coy about it. In shifting to the early days of the trial, \u201cSamson and Delilah\u201d foregrounds the whodunit aspects of the show, which means revealing new information on Naz and offering some more suspects who may or may not be red herrings. In digging around on Facebook, Box discovers that Naz switched high schools after his freshman year, transferring from a neighborhood school to one 40 minutes away by subway. It turns out that Naz received a two-week suspension for throwing another student down a flight of stairs, breaking his arm, and was unable to resettle after coming back. When Chandra questions him about it, Naz talks about the abuse he and members of his family absorbed after Sept. 11, framing the incident as retaliation. But he also admits to \u201cfeeling nothing\u201d afterward, other than a sliver of guilt over his mother\u2019s disappointment.For Stone and Chandra, this piece of information is the latest example of their client lying to them, but the news isn\u2019t all bad this week. Scanning surveillance footage at the gas station where Naz and Andrea stopped to fuel up, Chandra can be seen picking up on a hearse driver who says something to Andrea and follows them out of the station as they leave. When Chandra questions the driver, he refers to the biblical story of Samson and Delilah and talks about Andrea as a destroyer of men, \u201clike she the cat and you the yarn.\u201d The man seems like a classic red herring, but that fact that the episode is called \u201cSamson and Delilah\u201d lends his chilling speech some significance. The hearse driver may not be the culprit, but casting Andrea as the type of woman who attracts violence, if not instigates it, opens up the list of suspects.A likelier candidate is Andrea\u2019s stepfather, Don, who\u2019s already shown to be a sour, ill-tempered man with little apparent grief over her death. At the funeral, Stone picked up on a heated argument Don was having with another mourner, who turns out to be the financial adviser of Andrea\u2019s late mother. The adviser tells Stone off the record that Don stands to inherit a windfall from Andrea\u2019s death, because he can claim her half of his late wife\u2019s assets, including a brownstone that could be worth $10 million. Don\u2019s habit of dating older women of means marks him as a scam artist and gives him a strong motive for killing Andrea to collect the full inheritance. That Andrea used the phrase \u201cover my dead body\u201d to describe her stepfather\u2019s predatory only points more suspicion his way.All of this narrative business threatens to turn \u201cThe Night Of\u201d into souped-up \u201cLaw & Order,\u201d but as ever, the writer Richard Price sets it apart in the particulars. Stone\u2019s battle with eczema \u2014 which has become something of an internet obsession of late \u2014 ends abruptly with an herbal cocktail that clears his feet in time for the trial. Mr. Price treats it as a symbolic rite of passage: He\u2019s slipping into the dress shoes of a proper lawyer. Mr. Price also throws in the side business of unmonitored cellphone calls in prison, a monologue on \u201cgetting rid of nightmares\u201d in jury selection and the proper attire for defendants in criminal court. Even when it\u2019s cagey about its central mystery, the show continues to excel at the little things.Notes\u2022 Stone\u2019s efforts to minimize his cat allergy have gotten adorably absurd. The getup he wears to clean the litter box makes him look like a meth cook in \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d\u2022 This week brings the second example of an expert asking the prosecutor how she wants to angle the testimony. Last week, a pathologist offered to testify to a cut on Naz\u2019s hand consistent with his hand slipping down the knife handle. Now an expert is willing to testify that the drugs in Naz\u2019s body wouldn\u2019t keep him from committing the murder, despite the same cocktail leaving some people incapacitated.\u2022 Nice touch to show the potential jury pool sleeping through the obligatory video thanking them for fulfilling their constitutional duty. Sometimes the call to public service is answered with a yawn.\u2022 Freddy asks an important rhetorical question of Naz: \u201cDid you like your life out there?\u201d Naz cannot manage more than an affirmative shrug in reply. By taking a hit from Freddy\u2019s stash, he\u2019s prepping for a future where life on the inside will be more bearable.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Phoenix Rattled as Serial Gunman Leaves 7 Dead and 2 Injured", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a recent summer evening, a young man and a toddler were in a car stopped in a residential neighborhood in Phoenix when gunfire erupted. The two were not hurt, but investigators later said that it slowly dawned on them that they had a larger crime on their hands: A serial shooter had struck again.The attack on the car carrying the 21-year-old man and the 4-year-old boy on July 11 was the ninth time that an unidentified shooter had preyed on the city\u2019s neighborhoods this year, the police said. Since March, seven people have been killed and two injured.On Wednesday, the authorities stepped up their efforts to solve the shootings by republicizing an artist\u2019s sketch of the suspect, revealing details about the vehicles he had driven and raising the reward for any information leading to an arrest to $50,000 from $30,000.\u201cSomeone out there knows who did this,\u201d Joseph Yahner, chief of the Phoenix Police Department, said in a statement on Facebook.The Federal Bureau of Investigation and other federal agencies are also taking part in the search.The reward and the release of additional information have fueled amateur sleuthing by residents who are sharing ideas and information and suggesting lines of investigation via the Police Department\u2019s Facebook and Twitter pages, upending the notion of the traditional telephone tip line as a tool to help solve crimes.When investigators revealed that the suspect has access to several vehicles, including a BMW, a white Cadillac or \u201cLincoln-type vehicle,\u201d readers pressed for more details:\u201cAre the Cadillac and or Lincoln cars or SUVs?\u201d one man wrote.\u201cIf he has access to multiple vehicles could be working at a dealership,\u201d another wrote.\u201cOr maybe a mechanic!\u201d a third said.Some comments reflected a city unnerved by the seeming randomness of the targets.\u201cEverybody, let\u2019s help each other, protect each other, save a life before this punk takes another life,\u201d wrote one reader using the name Robin Chief.\u201cThis is ridiculous. How is this serial shooter making his way across Phoenix?\u201d another wrote.That string of highway shootings between Aug. 29 and Sept. 10 remains unsolved after prosecutors dismissed 16 felony charges against their sole suspect, Leslie Allen Merritt Jr., in April. No one was killed in those shootings.Others tried to ascribe a motive, saying the gunman could be a member of a hate group because the victims were either Hispanic or black. But there is no evidence yet to attribute a deliberate racial motive, Sgt. Jonathan Howard, a police spokesman, said on Thursday.Police officials said that while the online enthusiasm was encouraging, they urged residents to report information to the department.\u201cThe investigative team is counting on tips from the community to help solve these crimes,\u201d Sergeant g Howard said on Thursday. \u201cTips are coming in from a wide variety of sources including social media. However, we are encouraging people to report their tips directly.\u201dThe victims include Manuel Castro Garcia, who was killed in front of a home on June 10; and a 16-year-old boy who was wounded while walking in the street about 11:30 p.m. on March 17.The fear and uncertainty unleashed by the shootings are reminiscent of the terror that can follow random attacks, such as the ones by John Allen Muhammad and John Lee Malvo in 2002 in the Washington and Virginia areas.Almost all the shootings happened in southwest Phoenix, in predominantly Latino, working-class neighborhoods of low-slung cinder block houses, where many immigrant families find their foothold in the city. People who live there are worried and extra cautious about lingering on their driveways too long at night or letting children play on front yards.On the northeast side of the city, which is wealthier and predominantly white, the shootings rarely come up in conversation.Residents of the Maryvale neighborhood, site of at least one attack, say they are afraid to sit on their stoops, according to The Arizona Republic. Shrines of flowers and candles have cropped up on sidewalks. Some of those fatally shot had been listening to music in a car, or locking a door or heading to work.Fernanda Santos contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Rio \u2018Has Never Felt So Safe.\u2019 But What Happens After the Games?", "Date": "2016-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Portugal\u2019s education minister was robbed at knife point. So was the chief of security for the opening ceremony as he left Olympic Stadium. A police officer was killed when his vehicle was sprayed with gunfire, and an Olympics bus carrying journalists was attacked by people throwing rocks.Mindful of Rio\u2019s reputation for violent crime, the Brazilians have deployed 85,000 security personnel. This show of force includes 23,000 soldiers patrolling the city, some in military vehicles, along with helicopters and warships looming around the city\u2019s most popular beaches.\u201cThe city has never felt so safe,\u201d said Gilberto Dias, 50, a hot dog vendor who described how plainclothes officers had sprung to action one morning last week after two muggers accosted a tourist in the upscale Copacabana neighborhood. \u201cThey just materialized out of nowhere, which is something I\u2019ve never seen before.\u201dBut even before the Games began, Rio was facing a surge in lawlessness in recent months that had rattled residents and alarmed the authorities.With the economy in turmoil, assaults and robberies on the street jumped by 42 percent in May, with 10,000 robberies that month. And after years of declining homicides, the number of murders increased by more than 7 percent during the first half of the year, with over 1,500 people killed.\u201cThe assault on the American athlete is what happens to us in Rio every day,\u201d said Marcello Brito, 51, an architect, referring to Mr. Lochte.Rio\u2019s finances were so bad before the Games that it had declared a \u201cstate of calamity.\u201d Budgets had been gutted, with police officers and firefighters protesting delays in receiving pay by holding signs at the airport telling visitors, \u201cWelcome to hell.\u201dThe federal government responded with an $850 million bailout package to help the state of Rio de Janeiro stay afloat, pay salaries and keep essential services running during the Olympics.But the crisis in Rio\u2019s finances, which are heavily dependent on global oil prices, remains, and the security lapses threaten to undermine ambitions for a resurgence in the city\u2019s fortunes.Many residents have welcomed the increased security.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see soldiers patrolling the streets, at least where I live,\u201d said Cassius Almada, 39, a high school math teacher who lives in Copacabana. \u201cIt could be a lot worse.\u201dBut those living beyond the necklace of upscale seafront neighborhoods say the increased security has had little effect in communities that have long been troubled by violence.Maria do Ros\u00e1rio Silva Santos, 54, who was visiting Rio from Bras\u00edlia, the nation\u2019s capital, said she had been stunned to see young men \u2014 not police officers \u2014 toting guns casually in Acari, a working-class neighborhood in north Rio, where she was staying during the Games.\u201cIt was shocking to see,\u201d she said. \u201cAs far as I can tell, nothing has changed.\u201dJulita Lemgruber, the director of the Center for Studies on Public Security and Citizenship at Candido Mendes University in Rio, said it was na\u00efve to expect a drastic drop in crime during the Games.\u201cThe government thought a snap of their fingers would bring peace to a city that has lived through so much violence in the past few years,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t do any good to have this show of thousands of extra police unless you tell every Olympic athlete to walk the street with a policeman by his side.\u201d\u201cPolice forces are invading the favelas every day and killing people, which is outrageous,\u201d Ms. Lemgruber said. \u201cHow can anyone hope to bring peace by spreading violence?\u201dHeder Martins de Oliveira, the vice president of Brazil\u2019s National Association of Police Officers, said that the killing of the officer in Rio last week pointed to the risks that security forces faced daily in the city. Referring to the wave of armed assaults during the Games, he said, \u201cThe situation would be even worse, an international disgrace, if dedicated police weren\u2019t doing their job at this time.\u201d\u201cOf course, there\u2019s more attention to these episodes because they\u2019re taking place when the world is looking at Rio,\u201d Mr. Martins de Oliveira said. \u201cBut this is a dilemma that Rio faces on a daily basis.\u201dThe police have also been involved in violent episodes blemishing the Olympics. Over the weekend, an off-duty federal police official opened fire in the direction of a man he was brawling with at Rio Scenarium, a downtown nightclub. It was not clear whether anyone was seriously injured.Amid the surge in lawlessness, many residents have found a measure of solace on social media, where they commiserate about their experiences and document each episode of crime in hopes of spurring the authorities to action.Among dozens of Facebook groups focused on crime is \u201cWhere I was robbed,\u201d a user-generated map containing dots that form a road map of brutalization and despair.\u201cHello, hello, authorities!\u201d one Facebook user, Eliane Cattapan, wrote recently. \u201cWith the arrival of all the tourists, I\u2019m much more afraid of the rise in street crime than terrorism.\u201dPaula Moura and Vinod Sreeharsha contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro, and Tania Franco from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Affluent and Black, and Still Trapped by Segregation", "Date": "2016-08-20", "News": "Why well-off black families end up living in poorer areas than white families with similar or even lower incomes.Supported byMILWAUKEE \u2014 Their daughter was sick and they needed family around to help care for her, so JoAnne and Maanaan Sabir took an unexpected detour.They had spent years blowing past mileposts: earning advanced degrees and six-figure incomes, buying a 2,500-square-foot Victorian with hardwood floors. Yet here they were, both 37, moving to a corner of town pocked by empty lots, cramming into an apartment above Ms. Sabir\u2019s mother, in the very duplex that Ms. Sabir\u2019s grandparents had bought six decades earlier.Their new dwelling was in a part of the Lindsay Heights neighborhood where more than one in three families lives in poverty; gunshots were too often a part of the nighttime soundtrack. They planned to leave once their daughter, Ameera, was healthy.But then, reminding them of why they feel at home in communities like this one, their new neighbors started frequently checking on Ameera: Is she doing O.K.? And on their son, Taj: When\u2019s his next basketball game? Mr. Sabir\u2019s car stalled in the middle of the street one night, and it was the young men too often stereotyped as suspicious who helped him push it home. So many welcoming black faces like their own, they thought.\u201cIt felt like that\u2019s where we should be,\u201d Ms. Sabir said.It is a national phenomenon challenging the popular assumption that segregation is more about class than about race, that when black families earn more money, some ideal of post-racial integration will inevitably be reached.In fact, a New York Times analysis of 2014 census figures shows that income alone cannot explain, nor would it likely end, the segregation that has defined American cities and suburbs for generations.The result: Nationally, black and white families of similar incomes still live in separate worlds.In many of America\u2019s largest metropolitan areas, including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, black families making $100,000 or more are more likely to live in poorer neighborhoods than even white households making less than $25,000. This is particularly true in areas with a long history of residential segregation, like metropolitan Milwaukee.In one neighborhood on Milwaukee\u2019s predominantly black north side, that means the appearance of a new 4,000-square-foot home owned by a black energy executive and her husband, who host political fund-raisers with valet parking. Nearby, a financial adviser and his wife are stuck in the starter home they bought about 10 years ago, because it lost value and they couldn\u2019t sell it. Up the street, there\u2019s an engineer, living with her family, who said she stayed in the city for its amenities and to send the message, \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to run away.\u201dThe Sabirs share that mix of civic-minded motivation, and limitations. They are successful small-business owners with college degrees, yet even their choices have been circumscribed. The Victorian home they bought a decade ago, which they are now renting out, is in a majority black neighborhood where poverty has increased, damaging their investment. Their current neighborhood, where the duplex is, has a median household income of just $34,000 a year, or around $20,000 less than what\u2019s typical for the region.It\u2019s one of many ways that living around people whom they best relate to means wrestling day and night with the cumulative effects of racism.The burning cars and buildings, the people throwing rocks and bottles at police officers in riot gear \u2014 it was all happening last Saturday as Maanaan and JoAnne Sabir were settling in for the night just a few miles down the road.The 23-year-old man who had been shot by a black officer had ignored orders to drop a gun as he fled on foot after being pulled over in his car, the police said.\u201cYou\u2019re asking us to do the impossible, which is to tolerate a systemic demoralization of our own livelihood,\u201d Mr. Sabir said.Black families in Milwaukee have been confronting hostility for decades. Zeddie Quitman Hyler directly challenged housing segregation in 1955 when he began laying the foundation for a house on an open patch of land in the white western suburb of Wauwatosa.A postal worker and World War II veteran from rural Mississippi, Mr. Hyler was the first black man to try to build there, and his efforts were not appreciated. He returned to his construction site one day to find the frame damaged. He fixed it, but when he came back again, it had burned.So he enlisted several friends to camp out with him at the construction site one evening, rifles in hand, ready to turn away intruders. The vandals never returned, and Mr. Hyler finished building his house, which he lived in for nearly half a century until his death in 2004.While Mr. Hyler was branching out, Ms. Sabir\u2019s grandparents found themselves falling into the familiar cycle of segregation. Migrants from the South, they spent about 10 years trying to buy a house at a time when black families were overtly steered to particular blocks. Eventually, a family member who was a real estate agent worked her connections, and they landed the duplex on the corner of North 17th Street and North Avenue in the mid-1950s. The neighborhood was evolving from one that had been flush with synagogues and restaurants selling matzo ball soup.They were caught in the middle of white flight.The census tract where Ms. Sabir\u2019s grandparents settled was entirely white in 1950 except for the two people that the census listed as black and the six listed as \u201cother.\u201d By 1960, however, 2,344 black people called the area home, accounting for 65 percent of its population.Within a few years, Milwaukee\u2019s economy would start tanking. Tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs in the city were eliminated. Property values fell, while housing policies made it nearly impossible for black families to obtain loans and move to the suburbs, where many jobs were being relocated.The racial dividing lines were already drawn, however, and barriers to black upward mobility remained. Even the neighborhood where the baseball slugger Hank Aaron moved in the late 1950s could not avoid a downward spiral. While the black population in the Rufus King area grew from 0.4 percent in 1960 to 89 percent in 1980, its median home value dropped from 9 percent above the city\u2019s median to 23 percent below it, according to \u201cMilwaukee: City of Neighborhoods,\u201d a book by John Gurda.Few people around here are surprised, then, that only 11.1 percent of African-Americans in the region live in the suburbs, the lowest rate of black suburbanization among the 50 largest metropolitan areas in the country, according to a soon-to-be released study by Marc V. Levine, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.Milwaukee itself, which is nearly two-thirds nonwhite, has never elected a black mayor. As for Wauwatosa, the suburb that Mr. Hyler changed a generation ago, it is still 90 percent white.The Sabirs are trying to help their children maneuver through this complicated racial landscape.Taj and Ameera go to a Catholic private school in Milwaukee where most of the students are white, but return to a Muslim household in a neighborhood where most people look like them. Both environments present difficulties.At school, the Sabir children have heard a teacher play down slavery, and classmates stereotype black neighborhoods as bad and drug infested. On their block, where the sidewalks are cracked and some empty lots have been turned into gardens, they occasionally see drugs and fights.It\u2019s at times like those when JoAnne and Maanaan Sabir are happy that their children can come home, see the nuance of the black struggle and work to change it \u2014 as when Ameera helped petition to prevent a liquor store from opening in the neighborhood. Or when the children volunteer at a food bank down the block.Still, their parents can\u2019t help but flirt with the possibilities of another life. That\u2019s what they were doing one evening in late June as they cruised through the plush suburbs, partaking in a semiregular ritual of soaking in the Lake Michigan mansions and manicured lawns and wondering about life there. They rolled past children riding their bicycles alone at around 9 p.m., and Ms. Sabir marveled that they could do that.She thought back to when Taj, 12, had confronted her a few days earlier. He had asked for permission to ride his eight-speed bike around the block. Ms. Sabir could not go out to supervise him, so she said no.\u201cAre you finally going to admit that we live in a dangerous community?\u201d he said.Ms. Sabir pondered the question. She is trained for these moments, with a bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology and a master\u2019s in administrative social work, but she struggled. \u201cWe have challenges like every other community has challenges,\u201d she told him, adding, \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to figure out the best way to negotiate those challenges.\u201dManaging sometimes means moving on. And in Milwaukee\u2019s circle of affluent black professionals, that sometimes means decamping for majority white areas in the city or the suburbs.That\u2019s where Latisha Spence-Brookens and X\u2019antony Brookens Sr. found themselves five years ago after their North Milwaukee neighborhood rapidly deteriorated during the housing crash.They rolled into their new bungalow-style rental house in the village of Whitefish Bay, a suburb perched on Lake Michigan with a population so white (90 percent) that it has earned the moniker Whitefolks Bay. And then they looked around in amazement. People were walking. Everywhere.Some strolled past the two-story homes with red, white and blue bunting on the balconies. Others strolled along the main thoroughfare with a Starbucks, a sidewalk cafe, a store selling handblown glass, and a supermarket featuring live lobster, a full-service florist and Champagne caper vinaigrette.The Milwaukee neighborhood they had left behind, which was nearly 93 percent black, wasn\u2019t much for this kind of leisure. After they bought a two-bedroom home in 2008 for $98,000, the effects of the housing market collapse spread through the area. Homes were abandoned. Crime took over.Their son, X\u2019antony Jr., now 18, was walking home one afternoon, toting a plastic Walmart bag with a Barbie he had just bought for his little sister, Zaria, when a man approached him with a large rock in his hand.\u201cGive me all your money or I\u2019m going to bash your head in with this rock,\u201d the man told him.X\u2019antony Jr. hesitated.\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThis was my first time being robbed.\u201dSo he offered $5 to the robber, who took it and let X\u2019antony Jr. keep the Barbie.For X\u2019antony Sr., 48, the last straw came when a neighbor was held up at gunpoint as she came home with her two toddlers. It was too dangerous to stay, he thought.Their home value had plummeted by some 75 percent by then. They had no equity to buy up. So they walked away from the mortgage and rented a house in Whitefish Bay for $1,450 a month, nearly one and a half times what they had been paying for the home they owned.But finally, they thought, Zaria could ride her bicycle freely. X\u2019antony Jr. could enroll in a high-performing school district.Over the years, the Brookenses genuinely enjoyed their time in Whitefish Bay. Ms. Spence-Brookens, 39, worked as a college administrator and Mr. Brookens as a job counselor for food stamp recipients, and they sometimes would make it a point to get home early from work so they could spend time in the community. But it was hard to shake that feeling of otherness \u2014 especially for X\u2019antony Sr.About a week after the family moved there, a police officer pulled him over as he rolled up in his red 1994 Mercedes-Benz to the family\u2019s modest clapboard.He was pulled over, the officer said, because of the plastic cover over his license plate. Back in his old neighborhood, Mr. Brookens said, people often stole license plates, so the cover was for security. Here it was illegal, the officer told him. He let Mr. Brookens off with a warning, but not before asking if he lived around there.\u201cYeah, this is my house right here,\u201d Mr. Brookens told him.The stops were a routine occurrence early on \u2014 about once a week for a month and a half, Mr. Brookens said. He called it getting registered.\u201cThey\u2019re going to keep doing that until they become comfortable with who you are and why you\u2019re here,\u201d said Mr. Brookens, more resigned than angry.He had more disgust, however, when he took Zaria around the block on her bicycle and a mother rushed her white children inside as they approached.Mr. Brookens and his wife also worried about Zaria\u2019s sense of self. She always wanted to straighten her hair. She once bawled when her hair got wet in the bathtub and became frizzy. Zaria\u2019s school friends called her their black friend. Her musical tastes gravitated toward Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift.\u201cI thought she was getting lost,\u201d Mr. Brookens said.That was not necessarily in the front of the Brookenses\u2019 minds when, two years ago, a friend asked them to rent her cream-colored brick home in Milwaukee. It was surrounded by quiet bungalows and curved streets. It was bigger than their Whitefish Bay rental, and the rent was $350 cheaper.They thought of how the savings would allow them to do more of the things they like, such as travel. Although the house was in a neighborhood with a poverty rate 12 times higher and a median home value about one-third of that in their suburban neighborhood, they saw it as a place they could call home.So they returned to Milwaukee, to a different black neighborhood, joining the cluster of families like their own on the city\u2019s north side.Some of the old challenges re-emerged.About a month after moving there in 2014, Mr. Brookens forgot to lock his car door, and his charger and computer hard drive were stolen.Still, like many black families who have made similar choices, they say they feel more comfortable. Zaria, who recently turned 9, relishes seeing more children at school who look like her, and has come to embrace her blackness, going so far as to get dreadlocks. X\u2019antony Jr. has spent the summer working for an activist organization.The Brookenses now interact more frequently with their neighbors. They host cookouts regularly in their backyard, and they have decorated their shelves with plaques reminding them: \u201cHope is believing\u201d and \u201cFaith is endless.\u201dHope and faith, and determination, drive the Sabirs, too.That\u2019s what brought JoAnne Sabir\u2019s ancestors up here from Tennessee and Arkansas. It\u2019s why Mr. Sabir, a fourth-degree black belt in karate, is constantly pushing to help the young men he sees roaming the streets \u2014 \u201cYou got that r\u00e9sum\u00e9?\u201d he asks \u2014 and it\u2019s why the family is staking its business interests just a block from their apartment.They bet on the neighborhood by opening the Juice Kitchen in October. They both work there, often rising before 6 a.m., because they want to be a beacon of black success and help prevent drugs, alcohol and poverty from consuming the community.\u201cStrategically placed on North 17th Street,\u201d she wrote. \u201cStrategically available to love and nurture.\u201dA few hours later, she herded her children into her black sport-utility vehicle and slowly rolled past the remnants of the two nights of clashes between protesters and the police. Past the BP gas station, melted into an ashy heap. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible,\u201d Taj said. Past the people barbecuing on a grassy knoll. \u201cThat\u2019s the young man\u2019s brother over there that was killed,\u201d Ms. Sabir said. Past a boarded-up bank. \u201cThey broke in this bank and then set it on fire,\u201d she said.\u201cMy initial thought,\u201d Ms. Sabir told her children, \u201cwas that on this evening, all these young people were so powerful.\u201d But imagine, she added, if they could channel that anger in a positive direction, \u201cif we took that power and that energy and put it toward our greater good.\u201dEveryone in the car fell silent.Focusing on the bigger picture can be difficult.The following evening, on Wednesday night, as Mr. Sabir reclined on his front stoop, he shook his head as car after car whizzed through red lights at the corner. He mentioned a man from the neighborhood who was left in a vegetative state when an S.U.V. plowed into his car a few weeks earlier. \u201cIt aches,\u201d Mr. Sabir said.He rolled his eyes when a car pulled up to a house across the street at about 10:30 p.m. and started honking loudly. \u201cEvery night,\u201d Mr. Sabir said.And he just looked away when a man strolling in front of his house ditched a knife behind a parked car, only to be confronted by two police officers, with Tasers drawn, who arrested him. \u201cMass incarceration,\u201d Mr. Sabir said.But just as it seemed that the burdens of living here were converging, Mr. Sabir\u2019s phone buzzed with a reminder of why it was all worth it. The alderman representing the area where most of the past week\u2019s vandalism had occurred wrote that his battered neighborhood could really use a Juice Kitchen.\u201cHelp us,\u201d the alderman wrote, \u201cbe the Phoenix that rises from the ashes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The One That Got Away: How an Elusive Fish Captured a New York Town", "Date": "2016-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySCHENECTADY, N.Y. \u2014 It began, as so many eyebrow-raising stories do, with a tale about a fish.\u201cIt looks like a dinosaur, a prehistoric predator,\u201d Mr. Canavan, 20, said. His hunch that it wasn\u2019t supposed to be in Iroquois Lake, in the center of the perhaps aspirationally named Central Park, clashed with his catch-and-release credo. He let the creature thrashing at the end of his line go. \u201cLet it swim another day,\u201d he said.But just as all fish stories bulge and warp over time, the tale of Mr. Canavan\u2019s strange catch has since morphed into an epic. Along the way, it has hooked the imaginations of this industrial, upstate city of slightly over 65,000.Before Mr. Canavan freed the gar on July 17, he took a photograph of the fish that was some 1,200 miles away from its natural habitat to post on social media. His mother, who works at Union College here, shared the image on Facebook. A professor at the college spotted it and contacted the United States Geological Survey, which notified the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, according to Mr. Canavan.Agents from the department happened to be in the area, and knew right away that the gar should not be in the lake, said Chris VanMaaren, the agency\u2019s fisheries manager for the region. Mr. VanMaaren believes it may have been an aquarium pet, dumped into the water after growing too large. But in liberating it, its owner introduced an invasive species, an apex predator with a taste for sunfish that could harm the local ecosystem. Parkgoers also worried that it could take off a toe, though this seems more urban lore than anything based on scientific fact.So on July 27, two environmental protection agents plied a johnboat through the lake\u2019s waters in search of the gar. The flat-bottomed vessel was equipped with a device that sends out an electrical pulse designed to stun, not kill, fish. But after hours of work \u2014 as seems to be the way with mysterious aquatic sightings the world over \u2014 the long, thin gar was nowhere to be found among the stunned sunfish the agents collected, all of which were briskly revived and released. \u201cThey don\u2019t receive the electricity as well as a shorter, fatter fish,\u201d Mr. VanMaaren said. \u201cThey are typically hard to corner, so to speak.\u201dWith just one gar on the loose, and unlikely to survive an upstate winter, the agency had no plans to try again, Mr. VanMaaren said. (If the gar was caught, it would most likely be preserved in ethanol and exhibited at the New York State Museum in Albany, according to state officials. Adoption would be considered, however, if there were appropriate offers.)Enter the mayor of Schenectady, Gary McCarthy. He decided to take things into his own hands and pockets, offering a $100 reward from his wallet to anyone who caught the gar. \u201cIt\u2019s been elusive,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said.Enter the townspeople. Since Mr. McCarthy\u2019s offer, the park, moribund even on an August day, according to residents, has been packed. Its shoreline bristles with anglers of all ages. At Goldstock\u2019s Sporting Goods, in nearby Scotia, weekly sales of rods have quintupled to 25 a week. \u201cI love it, are you kidding?\u201d an owner, Mike Kausch, 61, said, referring to the gar. \u201cI should put one out there every couple days!\u201dThe fishermen and women seem driven by their own dreams. Liam Berry, 9, said he would use his winnings to take his family on a trip. He was disappointed to learn that gars prefer raw chicken and bacon over the three dozen lures he brought. Nearby, his competition, David Bryk, also 9, was fishing to finance his dream pet \u2014 a frog. Its name? \u201cCarlos, of course.\u201dOther people sat on the benches around the lake and quietly rooted for the gar. \u201cIt\u2019s not given fair odds in a little rinky-dink hole like this,\u201d Lisa Monfils, 46, said as her son, Alex Rossler, 12, reeled in yet another sunny in his search for the gar.As the hot summer weeks have wound on, a strange new twist has emerged from the pond: How is it possible, with scores of fishers dangling gar favorites like chicken livers and crispy baitfish at all hours of the day, that sunfish keep falling for the lure, but the gar has eluded what seems to be an entire town?Sitting in his rocking chair at Wiggly Worm Bait and Fishing Supply, in Ballston Lake, a few miles away, William Ingles, the shop\u2019s 92-year-old founder, had a theory: \u201cYou say, \u2018Wait a minute. All of a sudden we got 30, 40, 50 ones out there trying to catch this fish, and all of a sudden nobody\u2019s catching it?\u2019\u201d Perhaps, he mused, the gar was already gone. \u201cWhat would you do if someone caught the fish, and ate the fish, and everyone\u2019s still out there fishing?\u201dNear him a foot-thick encyclopedia of fish sat open to the entry for alligator gar (lepisosteus spatula), prepared for the daily onslaught of customer questions. (\u201cThe alligator gar has been under siege for much of the 20th century,\u201d the entry reads, under the \u201cill advised notion of ridding the water of gamefish-killing monsters.\u201d)As another week of the alligator gar\u2019s continued evasion loomed, the fish tale came full circle. Mr. Canavan said on Friday night that he was at Iroquois Lake that afternoon when a man caught the fish. \u201cMy leader was hanging from its mouth,\u201d he said. That is how he knew it was the same fish.Efforts to reach the mayor about the reward late on Friday were unsuccessful.Christopher Mele contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

Having broken his own world record in the snatch last week at 216 kilograms, or some 475 pounds, Salimikordasiabi, who also goes by the name Salimi, was on track for another Olympic medal.But in the final clean and jerk competition \u2014 when he lifted 245 kilograms, or 540 pounds \u2014 the competition jury overruled a decision by referees, deciding that one of his arms had not been straight and that he had not demonstrated control.Salimikordasiabi\u2019s chance at a medal was gone. And Iranian fans erupted, pointing out, among other things, that one of the five judges on the jury came from Iraq, Iran\u2019s neighbor and political enemy.Athletes from Georgia and Armenia took gold, silver and bronze in the event.A spokeswoman for the federation did not immediately reply to a request for comment Monday as to what kind of investigation was proceeding and if disciplinary sanctions against any organization were being explored.Salimikordasiabi has stirred controversy within Iran in past years, too. He was left off the Iranian national team for the 2013 world championships after he engaged in a heated debate on television with Iran\u2019s weight lifting coach, calling him abusive.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Diet: He\u2019ll Have Fries With That", "Date": "2016-08-08", "News": "Supported byGeorge W. Bush was an exercise buff, obsessed with staying trim by mountain biking and clearing brush at his ranch in Crawford, Tex.But Donald J. Trump is taking a different approach: A junk food aficionado, he is hoping to become the nation\u2019s fast food president.Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign is improvised, undisciplined, rushed and self-indulgent.And so is his diet.In an era of gourmet dining and obsession with healthy ingredients, Mr. Trump is a throwback to an earlier, more carefree time in American eating, when nobody bothered to ask whether the tomatoes were locally grown, and the first lady certainly didn\u2019t have a vegetable garden, complete with a bee hive, on the South Lawn of the White House.But his highbrow, lowbrow image \u2014 of the jet-setting mogul who takes buckets of fried chicken onto his private plane with the gold-plated seatbelt buckles \u2014 is also a carefully crafted one.If President George Bush revealed his patrician upbringing by requesting \u201ca splash\u201d more coffee at a truck stop in New Hampshire, and John Kerry helped reinforce his image as a New England blue blood by trying to order a cheese steak with Swiss in South Philadelphia, Mr. Trump\u2019s diet also telegraphs to his blue-collar base that he is one of them.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more American and more of-the-people than fast food,\u201d said Russ Schriefer, a Republican strategist and ad maker. \u201cIt is the peculiarity of the brand that he\u2019s able to be on his multimillion-dollar jet with the gold and black branding and colors, and at the same time eat KFC \u2014 and what makes it perfect is he does it all with a knife and fork, while reading The Wall Street Journal.\u201dOr, as Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser and pollster on the Trump campaign, put it, \u201cIt goes with his authenticity.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think Hillary Clinton would be eating Popeye\u2019s biscuits and fried chicken,\u201d she said.Still, Mr. Trump seems to come by his appetite for fast food genuinely.While junk food has long been a staple of campaign trail life \u2014 Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 press corps coined the term \u201cslunch\u201d to refer to the unhealthy phenomenon of the \u201csecond lunch\u201d \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s reliance on high-calorie fare is driven more by a combination of speed, efficiency and, above all else, cleanliness.Mr. Trump has even suggested doing away with state dinners, in a fit of cost and time savings. \u201cWe should be eating a hamburger on a conference table, and we should make better deals with China and others and forget the state dinners,\u201d he said.Mr. Christie watched with confusion and a bit of awe, he recalled in the interview. Mr. Trump looked at him and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll love it.\u201dBut Mr. Trump, who frets about germs and prizes cleanliness, also loves fast food because of its consistency and the promise, at least, of a basic level of hygiene.\u201cOne bad hamburger, you can destroy McDonald\u2019s. One bad hamburger, you take Wendy\u2019s and all these other places and they\u2019re out of business,\u201d Mr. Trump told Mr. Cooper of CNN. \u201cI\u2019m a very clean person. I like cleanliness, and I think you\u2019re better off going there than maybe someplace that you have no idea where the food\u2019s coming from. It\u2019s a certain standard.\u201dStill, he added, \u201cI think the food\u2019s good.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s dining habits also bespeak a certain lack of creativity, and parochialism \u2014 the kid from Queens who made it across the river to Manhattan\u2019s glistening skyline, but never cottoned to the city\u2019s haute cuisine. He once praised the \u201cimagination\u201d of his wife, Melania, in the kitchen \u2014 before citing, as examples of her culinary derring-do, spaghetti and meat sauce, salads and meatloaf. (He still keeps a copy of his mother\u2019s meatloaf recipe.) Along with McDonald\u2019s, his favorite fast food joint, a family member said, is Jackson Hole Burgers.He is also a stickler for manners, attacking his primary race rival, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, for scarfing down meals during impromptu news conferences. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a human being eat in such a disgusting fashion!\u201d Mr. Trump told a crowd.And Mr. Trump, who sometimes sips his Diet Coke through a straw, once caused Manhattan foodies to weep into their quinoa when he took Sarah Palin to a Famous Famiglia pizza restaurant in Times Square \u2014 and then proceeded to cut his oversize slice with a plastic knife and fork.So pronounced are Mr. Trump\u2019s fast food preferences that Philip E. Beshara, a Washington-based lawyer, joked on Instagram that, as president, his cabinet would probably be staffed by Colonel Sanders, the Hamburglar and the Taco Bell Chihuahua.And, of course, the Republican nominee\u2019s dining whims also keep his team on its toes, with staff members worrying not just about the backdrop for his speeches \u2014 but also where to find the nearest drive-through.\u201cThere\u2019s never any real planning for food,\u201d said one, between events on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s always just whatever he is craving, which is more often than not McDonald\u2019s.\u201dNick Corasaniti and Kitty Bennett contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Do Your Friends Actually Like You?", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisTHINK of all the people with whom you interact during the course of a day, week, month and year. The many souls with whom you might exchange a greeting or give a warm embrace; engage in chitchat or have a deeper conversation. All those who, by some accident of fate, inhabit your world. And then ask yourself who among them are your friends \u2014 your true friends. Recent research indicates that only about half of perceived friendships are mutual. That is, someone you think is your friend might not be so keen on you. Or, vice versa, as when someone you feel you hardly know claims you as a bestie.It\u2019s a startling finding that has prompted much discussion among psychologists, neuroscientists, organizational behavior experts, sociologists and philosophers. Some blame human beings\u2019 basic optimism, if not egocentrism, for the disconnect between perceived and actual friendships. Others point to a misunderstanding of the very notion of friendship in an age when \u201cfriend\u201d is used as a verb, and social inclusion and exclusion are as easy as a swipe or a tap on a smartphone screen. It\u2019s a concern because the authenticity of one\u2019s relationships has an enormous impact on one\u2019s health and well-being.The study analyzed friendship ties among 84 subjects (ages 23 to 38) in a business management class by asking them to rank one another on a five-point continuum of closeness from \u201cI don\u2019t know this person\u201d to \u201cOne of my best friends.\u201d The feelings were mutual 53 percent of the time while the expectation of reciprocity was pegged at 94 percent. This is consistent with data from several other friendship studies conducted over the past decade, encompassing more than 92,000 subjects, in which the reciprocity rates ranged from 34 percent to 53 percent.Mr. Pentland said it could be that \u201cthe possibility of nonreciprocal friendship challenges one\u2019s self-image.\u201d But the problem may have more to do with confusion over what friendship is. Ask people to define friendship \u2014 even researchers like Mr. Pentland who study it \u2014 and you\u2019ll get an uncomfortable silence followed by \u201cer\u201d or \u201cum.\u201dIt is not a means to obtain higher status, wangle an invitation to someone\u2019s vacation home or simply escape your own boredom. Rather, Mr. Nehamas said, friendship is more like beauty or art, which kindles something deep within us and is \u201cappreciated for its own sake.\u201d\u201cTreating friends like investments or commodities is anathema to the whole idea of friendship,\u201d said Ronald Sharp, a professor of English at Vassar College, who teaches a course on the literature of friendship. \u201cIt\u2019s not about what someone can do for you, it\u2019s who and what the two of you become in each other\u2019s presence.\u201dBy his definition, friends are people you take the time to understand and allow to understand you.\u201cThere is a limited amount of time and emotional capital we can distribute, so we only have five slots for the most intense type of relationship,\u201d Mr. Dunbar said. \u201cPeople may say they have more than five but you can be pretty sure they are not high-quality friendships.\u201dIn the presence of a true friend, Dr. Banks said, the smart or modulating aspect of the vagus nerve is what makes us feel at ease rather than on guard as when we are with a stranger or someone judgmental. It\u2019s what enables us to feel O.K. about exposing the soft underbelly of our psyche and helps us stay engaged and present in times of conflict. Lacking authentic friendships, the smart vagus nerve is not exercised. It loses tone and one\u2019s anxiety remains high, making abiding, deep connections difficult.So it\u2019s worth identifying who among the many people you encounter in your life are truly friends. Who makes time for you? Whose company enlivens, enriches and maybe even humbles you? Whom would you miss? Who would miss you? While there is no easy or agreed upon definition, what friendships have in common is that they shape us and create other dimensions through which to see the world. This can be for better or worse depending on whom we choose as friends. As the saying goes, \u201cShow me your friends and I will show you who you are.\u201dKate Murphy is a journalist in Houston who writes frequently for The New York Times.Advertisement"}

Either way, in the last year, it has almost certainly become more intense. You\u2019ve seen a lot of media sources you don\u2019t recognize and a lot of posts bearing no memorable brand at all. You\u2019ve seen politicians and celebrities and corporations weigh in directly; you\u2019ve probably seen posts from the candidates themselves. You\u2019ve seen people you\u2019re close to and people you\u2019re not, with increasing levels of urgency, declare it is now time to speak up, to take a stand, to set aside allegiances or hangups or political correctness or hate.The Facebook product, to users in 2016, is familiar yet subtly expansive. Its algorithms have their pick of text, photos and video produced and posted by established media organizations large and small, local and national, openly partisan or nominally unbiased. But there\u2019s also a new and distinctive sort of operation that has become hard to miss: political news and advocacy pages made specifically for Facebook, uniquely positioned and cleverly engineered to reach audiences exclusively in the context of the news feed. These are news sources that essentially do not exist outside of Facebook, and you\u2019ve probably never heard of them. They have names like Occupy Democrats; The Angry Patriot; US Chronicle; Addicting Info; RightAlerts; Being Liberal; Opposing Views; Fed-Up Americans; American News; and hundreds more. Some of these pages have millions of followers; many have hundreds of thousands.Using a tool called CrowdTangle, which tracks engagement for Facebook pages across the network, you can see which pages are most shared, liked and commented on, and which pages dominate the conversation around election topics. Using this data, I was able to speak to a wide array of the activists and entrepreneurs, advocates and opportunists, reporters and hobbyists who together make up 2016\u2019s most disruptive, and least understood, force in media.Individually, these pages have meaningful audiences, but cumulatively, their audience is gigantic: tens of millions of people. On Facebook, they rival the reach of their better-funded counterparts in the political media, whether corporate giants like CNN or The New York Times, or openly ideological web operations like Breitbart or Mic. And unlike traditional media organizations, which have spent years trying to figure out how to lure readers out of the Facebook ecosystem and onto their sites, these new publishers are happy to live inside the world that Facebook has created. Their pages are accommodated but not actively courted by the company and are not a major part of its public messaging about media. But they are, perhaps, the purest expression of Facebook\u2019s design and of the incentives coded into its algorithm \u2014 a system that has already reshaped the web and has now inherited, for better or for worse, a great deal of America\u2019s political discourse.Occupy got him on Facebook, but it was the 2012 election that showed him its potential. As he saw it, that election was defined by social media. He mentioned a set of political memes that now feel generationally distant: Clint Eastwood\u2019s empty chair at the 2012 Republican National Convention and Mitt Romney\u2019s debate gaffe about \u201cbinders full of women.\u201d He thought it was a bit silly, but he saw in these viral moments a language in which activists like him could spread their message.This year, political content has become more popular all across the platform: on homegrown Facebook pages, through media companies with a growing Facebook presence and through the sharing habits of users in general. But truly Facebook-native political pages have begun to create and refine a new approach to political news: cherry-picking and reconstituting the most effective tactics and tropes from activism, advocacy and journalism into a potent new mixture. This strange new class of media organization slots seamlessly into the news feed and is especially notable in what it asks, or doesn\u2019t ask, of its readers. The point is not to get them to click on more stories or to engage further with a brand. The point is to get them to share the post that\u2019s right in front of them. Everything else is secondary.While web publishers have struggled to figure out how to take advantage of Facebook\u2019s audience, these pages have thrived. Unburdened of any allegiance to old forms of news media and the practice, or performance, of any sort of ideological balance, native Facebook page publishers have a freedom that more traditional publishers don\u2019t: to engage with Facebook purely on its terms. These are professional Facebook users straining to build media companies, in other words, not the other way around.From a user\u2019s point of view, every share, like or comment is both an act of speech and an accretive piece of a public identity. Maybe some people want to be identified among their networks as news junkies, news curators or as some sort of objective and well-informed reader. Many more people simply want to share specific beliefs, to tell people what they think or, just as important, what they don\u2019t. A newspaper-style story or a dry, matter-of-fact headline is adequate for this purpose. But even better is a headline, or meme, that skips straight to an ideological conclusion or rebuts an argument.Rafael Rivero is an acquaintance of Provost\u2019s who, with his twin brother, Omar, runs a page called Occupy Democrats, which passed three million followers in June. This accelerating growth is attributed by Rivero, and by nearly every left-leaning page operator I spoke with, not just to interest in the election but especially to one campaign in particular: \u201cBernie Sanders is the Facebook candidate,\u201d Rivero says. The rise of Occupy Democrats essentially mirrored the rise of Sanders\u2019s primary run. On his page, Rivero started quoting text from Sanders\u2019s frequent email blasts, turning them into Facebook-ready memes with a consistent aesthetic: colors that pop, yellow on black. Rivero says that it\u2019s clear what his audience wants. \u201cI\u2019ve probably made 10,000 graphics, and it\u2019s like running 10,000 focus groups,\u201d he said. (Clinton was and is, of course, widely discussed by Facebook users: According to the company, in the last month 40.8 million people \u201cgenerated interactions\u201d around the candidate. But Rivero says that in the especially engaged, largely oppositional left-wing-page ecosystem, Clinton\u2019s message and cautious brand didn\u2019t carry.)Because the Sanders campaign has come to an end, these sites have been left in a peculiar position, having lost their unifying figure as well as their largest source of engagement. Audiences grow quickly on Facebook but can disappear even more quickly; in the case of left-leaning pages, many had accumulated followings not just by speaking to Sanders supporters but also by being intensely critical, and often utterly dismissive, of Clinton.\u201cIt\u2019s like a meme war,\u201d Rivero says, \u201cand politics is being won and lost on social media.\u201dThis was, for most news organizations, a boon. The flood of visitors aligned with two core goals of most media companies: to reach people and to make money. But as Facebook\u2019s growth continued, its influence was intensified by broader trends in internet use, primarily the use of smartphones, on which Facebook became more deeply enmeshed with users\u2019 daily routines. Soon, it became clear that Facebook wasn\u2019t just a source of readership; it was, increasingly, where readers lived.Facebook, from a publisher\u2019s perspective, had seized the web\u2019s means of distribution by popular demand. A new reality set in, as a social-media network became an intermediary between publishers and their audiences. For media companies, the ability to reach an audience is fundamentally altered, made greater in some ways and in others more challenging. For a dedicated Facebook user, a vast array of sources, spanning multiple media and industries, is now processed through the same interface and sorting mechanism, alongside updates from friends, family, brands and celebrities.From the start, some publishers cautiously regarded Facebook as a resource to be used only to the extent that it supported their existing businesses, wary of giving away more than they might get back. Others embraced it more fully, entering into formal partnerships for revenue sharing and video production, as The New York Times has done. Some new-media start-ups, most notably BuzzFeed, have pursued a comprehensively Facebook-centric production-and-distribution strategy. All have eventually run up against the same reality: A company that can claim nearly every internet-using adult as a user is less a partner than a context \u2014 a self-contained marketplace to which you have been granted access but which functions according to rules and incentives that you cannot control.The news feed is designed, in Facebook\u2019s public messaging, to \u201cshow people the stories most relevant to them\u201d and ranks stories \u201cso that what\u2019s most important to each person shows up highest in their news feeds.\u201d It is a framework built around personal connections and sharing, where value is both expressed and conferred through the concept of engagement. Of course, engagement, in one form or another, is what media businesses have always sought, and provocation has always sold news. But now the incentives are literalized in buttons and written into software.Readers who clicked through to the story were led to an external website, called Make America Great Today, where they were presented with a brief write-up blended almost seamlessly into a solid wall of fleshy ads. Khan, the story said \u2014 between ads for \u201c(1) Odd Trick to \u2018Kill\u2019 Herpes Virus for Good\u201d and \u201c22 Tank Tops That Aren\u2019t Covering Anything\u201d \u2014 is an agent of the Muslim Brotherhood and a \u201cpromoter of Islamic Shariah law.\u201d His late son, the story suggests, could have been a \u201cMuslim martyr\u201d working as a double agent. A credit link beneath the story led to a similar-looking site called Conservative Post, from which the story\u2019s text was pulled verbatim. Conservative Post had apparently sourced its story from a longer post on a right-wing site called Shoebat.com.Within 24 hours, the post was shared more than 3,500 times, collecting a further 3,000 reactions \u2014 thumbs-up likes, frowning emoji, angry emoji \u2014 as well as 850 comments, many lengthy and virtually all impassioned. A modest success. Each day, according to Facebook\u2019s analytics, posts from the Make America Great page are seen by 600,000 to 1.7 million people. In July, articles posted to the page, which has about 450,000 followers, were shared, commented on or liked more than four million times, edging out, for example, the Facebook page of USA Today.Nicoloff\u2019s business model is not dissimilar from the way most publishers use Facebook: build a big following, post links to articles on an outside website covered in ads and then hope the math works out in your favor. For many, it doesn\u2019t: Content is expensive, traffic is unpredictable and website ads are both cheap and alienating to readers. But as with most of these Facebook-native pages, Nicoloff\u2019s content costs comparatively little, and the sheer level of interest in Trump and in the type of inflammatory populist rhetoric he embraces has helped tip Nicoloff\u2019s system of advertising arbitrage into serious profitability. In July, visitors arriving to Nicoloff\u2019s website produced a little more than $30,000 in revenue. His costs, he said, total around $8,000, partly split between website hosting fees and advertising buys on Facebook itself.Terry Littlepage, an internet marketer based in Las Cruces, N.M., has taken this model even further. He runs a collection of about 50 politically themed Facebook pages with names like The American Patriot and My Favorite Gun, which push visitors to a half-dozen external websites, stocked with content aggregated by a team of freelancers. He estimates that he spends about a thousand dollars a day advertising his pages on Facebook; as a result, they have more than 10 million followers. In a good month, Littlepage\u2019s properties bring in $60,000.Nicoloff and Littlepage say that Trump has been good for business, but each admits to some discomfort. Nicoloff, a conservative, says that there were other candidates he preferred during the Republican primaries but that he had come around to the nominee. Littlepage is also a recent convert. During the primaries, he was a Cruz supporter, and he even tried making some left-wing pages on Facebook but discovered that they just didn\u2019t make him as much money.In their angry, cascading comment threads, Make America Great\u2019s followers express no such ambivalence. Nearly every page operator I spoke to was astonished by the tone their commenters took, comparing them to things like torch-wielding mobs and sharks in a feeding frenzy. No doubt because of the page\u2019s name, some Trump supporters even mistake Nicoloff\u2019s page for an official organ of the campaign. Nicoloff says that he receives dozens of messages a day from Trump supporters, expecting or hoping to reach the man himself. Many, he says, are simply asking for money.A dozen or so of the sites are published in-house, but posts from the company\u2019s small team of writers are free to be shared among the entire network. The deal for a would-be Liberty Alliance member is this: You bring the name and the audience, and the company will build you a prefab site, furnish it with ads, help you fill it with content and keep a cut of the revenue. Coca told me the company brought in $12 million in revenue last year. (The company declined to share documentation further corroborating his claims about followers and revenue.)Because the pages are run independently, the editorial product is varied. But it is almost universally tuned to the cadences and styles that seem to work best on partisan Facebook. It also tracks closely to conservative Facebook media\u2019s big narratives, which, in turn, track with the Trump campaign\u2019s messaging: Hillary Clinton is a crook and possibly mentally unfit; ISIS is winning; Black Lives Matter is the real racist movement; Donald Trump alone can save us; the system \u2014 all of it \u2014 is rigged. Whether the Liberty Alliance succeeds or fails will depend, at least in part, on Facebook\u2019s algorithm. Systemic changes to the ecosystem arrive through algorithmic adjustments, and the company recently adjusted the news feed to \u201cfurther reduce clickbait headlines.\u201dFor now, the network hums along, mostly beneath the surface. A post from a Liberty Alliance page might find its way in front of a left-leaning user who might disagree with it or find it offensive, and who might choose to engage with the friend who posted it directly. But otherwise, such news exists primarily within the feeds of the already converted, its authorship obscured, its provenance unclear, its veracity questionable. It\u2019s an environment that\u2019s at best indifferent and at worst hostile to traditional media brands; but for this new breed of page operator, it\u2019s mostly upside. In front of largely hidden and utterly sympathetic audiences, incredible narratives can take shape, before emerging, mostly formed, into the national discourse.Before Hannity signed off, he posed a question: \u201cSo, does that mean anything?\u201d It\u2019s a version of the question that everyone wants to answer about Facebook and politics, which is whether the site\u2019s churning political warfare is actually changing minds \u2014 or, for that matter, beginning to change the political discourse as a whole. How much of what happens on the platform is a reflection of a political mood and widely held beliefs, simply captured in a new medium, and how much of it might be created, or intensified, by the environment it provides? What is Facebook doing to our politics?Appropriately, the answer to this question can be chosen and shared on Facebook in whichever way you prefer. You might share this story from The New York Times Magazine, wondering aloud to your friends whether our democracy has been fundamentally altered by this publishing-and-advertising platform of unprecedented scale. Or you might just relax and find some memes to share from one of countless pages that will let you air your political id. But for the page operators, the question is irrelevant to the task at hand. Facebook\u2019s primacy is a foregone conclusion, and the question of Facebook\u2019s relationship to political discourse is absurd \u2014 they\u2019re one and the same. As Rafael Rivero put it to me, \u201cFacebook is where it\u2019s all happening.\u201dJohn Herrman is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Much Does Donald Trump Pay in Taxes? It Could Be Zero", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseMitt Romney was excoriated during the 2012 presidential campaign for paying $4.9 million in federal income tax, or an average of just 14 percent of his adjusted gross income, in the two years for which he released returns.No one should be surprised, though, if Donald J. Trump has paid far less \u2014 perhaps even zero federal income tax in some years. Indeed, that\u2019s the expectation of numerous real estate and tax professionals I\u2019ve interviewed in recent weeks.Even with hundreds of millions in gross revenue from his vast real estate empire, \u201cit\u2019s both possible and legal that Donald Trump would pay little or no income tax,\u201d said Len Green, an accountant and chairman of the Green Group, a tax and accounting advisory firm. Mr. Green is also a real estate investor, teaches at Babson College and is the author of the forthcoming \u201cThe Entrepreneur\u2019s Playbook.\u201d\u201cI would expect he\u2019s paying little or no tax,\u201d agreed Steven M. Rosenthal, a veteran tax lawyer and senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy center.That\u2019s because Mr. Trump, as a prominent and active developer, can take advantage of some of the most generous tax breaks in the federal tax code to reduce his reported income to near zero, or even report a loss.Few tax advisers to major real estate developers would speak for attribution, because their clients benefit from the same tax breaks available to Mr. Trump. But all told me they knew developers in Mr. Trump\u2019s league who pay little or no income tax despite hundreds of millions in cash flow.\u201cReal estate is notorious for throwing off huge deductions,\u201d Mr. Rosenthal said. \u201cThat coupled with wide latitude in the timing and recognition of income make real estate development extremely attractive from a tax standpoint.\u201dThe Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment, nor did William F. Nelson, a former general counsel to the Internal Revenue Service and partner at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax lawyers.Mr. Trump has said in the past that highly paid corporate executives \u201cget away with murder\u201d on their taxes while boasting that he pays as little as the law allows. At the same time, he has insisted that his federal income tax payments are \u201csubstantial.\u201dNo one I spoke to has seen Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns, because he has not released them. One obvious potential reason is that he reports little or no taxable income, and thus pays very little to support the government he wants to run. He is not obligated by law to make his returns public, but every candidate since Richard Nixon refused to has done so. (Gerald Ford released summaries.) Mr. Romney was harshly criticized for releasing just two years\u2019 worth, and it became a major campaign issue four years ago.Even though his recent returns are confidential, the notion that Mr. Trump has paid little or no tax is not entirely speculative. It\u2019s consistent with Mr. Trump\u2019s returns from the late 1970s, which he filed with the New Jersey Casino Control Commission when applying for a casino license in 1981. Mr. Trump reported losses and paid no federal income tax in 1978 and 1979 and paid only modest sums \u2014 a total of less than $75,000 \u2014 for the prior three years.Their conclusions are reinforced by Mr. Trump\u2019s extensive financial disclosures required of presidential candidates. His latest filing in May lists 564 entities in which he holds a position, usually president, director or \u201cmember.\u201d Most are corporations, usually owned in turn by a limited liability company and associated with a specific Trump-owned property, such as the office tower at 40 Wall Street (the subject of four such L.L.C.s, each of which owns a major interest in the other). That does not count entities in which Mr. Trump does not hold any position.He lists 188 entries under \u201cemployment assets and income.\u201d Candidates are only required to list assets from which they earn more than $200; reporting money-losing ventures is optional.L.L.C.s pass on income tax-free (and, equally important, losses) to their owners. Real estate L.L.C.s can generate enormous losses, even with millions in revenue, because of depreciation, interest payments, real estate taxes and operating costs. Mr. Trump can use paper losses to offset taxable income, such as interest, dividends, royalties and employment income.That\u2019s a loophole that was eliminated for most investors in the landmark tax reform legislation in 1986. But because of aggressive lobbying by the powerful real estate industry, so-called active developers like Mr. Trump were exempted from restrictions on using such paper losses to offset ordinary income.The tax value of Mr. Trump\u2019s paper losses may well exceed his investment in the underlying properties, because he and other developers typically make minimal down payments and use as much debt as possible to finance a purchase. To take just one example, Mr. Trump bought what is now the Trump National Doral Miami resort and golf club for $150 million while it was in bankruptcy proceedings and financed the purchase with $125 million in loans from Deutsche Bank.Interest payments on mortgages and loans are deductible. How much total debt Mr. Trump\u2019s properties have incurred is not known, but based on his latest financial disclosure (which shows only ranges), it\u2019s at least $250 million and probably far more than that, with some estimates close to $1 billion. At an average interest rate of 4 percent, that deduction alone is worth at least $10 million a year and perhaps $40 million or more.At least interest is a cash payment. Depreciation is a noncash charge, and is largely an accounting conceit that benefits real estate investors. The theory is that real estate loses value over time and is eventually worthless. As everyone surely knows, most real estate has historically appreciated in value.How much Mr. Trump\u2019s property investments might throw off in depreciation depends on what he paid for them, how much he\u2019s spent on capital improvements and how the assets are categorized (some assets qualify for accelerated depreciation). But the 39-year depreciation schedule for commercial property, and purchases and capital investments of $2 billion (a modest estimate, given that Mr. Trump values his assets at $10 billion), would generate depreciation deductions of $50 million a year.Depreciation is ordinarily recaptured and taxed when an asset is sold. But Mr. Trump and other developers can benefit from provisions that make that unlikely. If they sell appreciated properties at a large profit but use the proceeds to buy other real estate, the transactions may be considered a \u201clike-kind\u201d exchange. If so, there\u2019s no tax on the gain.Critics have called like-kind exchanges an outrageous tax loophole that benefits wealthy real estate developers and other investors to the tune of $33 billion in lost tax revenue a year. The Obama administration has called for repealing it, and several bipartisan measures to do so have been introduced in Congress, all to no avail given the gridlock over tax reform.\u201cIt\u2019s a big loophole,\u201d Mr. Rosenthal said of the like-kind exchange provisions. \u201cIt allows well-to-do and well-advised taxpayers to defer their tax liability potentially until death.\u201dAlmost all presidential nominees since 1976 have made their tax returns public, most around Tax Day in April  \u2014 about 200 days before the election.Mr. Trump\u2019s business entities also deduct real estate taxes and all their operating costs and expenses, which might well include most of Mr. Trump\u2019s living and travel expenses, because his personal and business lives are so intertwined. (Even his suits are presumably a business cost, because he has a men\u2019s wear line.)\u201cThe difference between business and personal costs can be a very fine line,\u201d Mr. Green said, \u201cespecially for someone like Trump.\u201dThis may also explain why Mr. Trump has not disclosed many large charitable contributions, because the charitable deduction would be of scant value if he has little or no taxable income.The enormous tax benefits available to real estate developers like Mr. Trump make yet another a compelling case for overhauling the tax system. But that\u2019s not to say he\u2019s done anything wrong.\u201cPeople aren\u2019t obligated to pay taxes they don\u2019t owe,\u201d Mr. Green said. \u201cIt\u2019s the job of tax professionals to use every legal means to minimize taxes, and I\u2019m sure Trump has some of the best working for him. Many wealthy people pay no tax.\u201dBut they\u2019re not running for president.\u201cIt is disqualifying for a modern-day presidential nominee to refuse to release tax returns to the voters,\u201d Mitt Romney recently said on Facebook.He, of all people, should know.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of some business structures in which Mr. Trump holds a position. They are limited liability companies, not corporations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Irredeemable Twin", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s rich, as the English would say, that Donald Trump is trying to profit from Anthony Weiner\u2019s latest mortification, because Trump is to his persevering supporters what Weiner was to his long-suffering wife: a scoundrel undeserving of so many second chances; a head case incapable of the redemption that\u2019s supposedly just a few extra measures of discipline away; someone selling himself as a servant of the public although he\u2019s really a slave to his own raging ego and unquenchable needs.When Trump looks in the mirror, there\u2019s a whole lot of Weiner staring back at him.The details are tawdrier in Weiner\u2019s case, and the stakes far smaller. But both men are creatures of potent want and pure compulsion who lucked into forgiving audiences. Weiner\u2019s finally stopped forgiving: Huma Abedin announced that she was formally separating from him after six years of marriage.Trump still has legions by his side. But for how long?The left side of the chart presented a timeline of his apostasies and indecencies, and it alone was transfixing: a reminder that any other candidate at any other time would have been undone by just one or two of these outrages; an illustration of the way they keep coming, no matter how ardently his inner circle pleads with him for calm, no matter how furiously the outside world reacts. He can\u2019t help himself.The right side of the chart presented another timeline, this one showing the points at which each of the 110 Republicans bolted. The surprise was how delayed their departures were. Hope is a stubborn thing.And at some point, it\u2019s too rosy a word for what\u2019s really going on, which is denial, delusion.There\u2019s also brutal calculation: Does Trump\u2019s function as a barrier against a Democratic president \u2014 against Hillary Clinton, in particular \u2014 outweigh his cruelty, his incivility, his bigotry, his utter fraudulence? Too many Republicans have convinced themselves of that, in part by minimizing those vices, seeing them as ephemeral, or simply averting their gazes.Some of these Republicans are living in the same fairy tale that some spouses are. They\u2019re telling themselves the same lie: that fidelity matters more than dignity and common sense. But if a crucial part of wisdom is knowing when to invest, an equally crucial part is knowing when to let go.The Weiner-Abedin marriage had apparently devolved, even before the latest revelation of fresh sexting, into a blunt child care arrangement, with Mr. Weiner\u2019s attentions to their 4-year-old son making her heavy travel schedule with Clinton possible.If Trump wants to make Abedin an issue, he\u2019s on fairer, sturdier ground with the extra pay from outside sources that Clinton arranged for her when they worked together at the State Department.He\u2019s on dangerous turf when he goes after Weiner as a \u201csicko\u201d and a \u201cpervert.\u201d He\u2019s no paragon of rectitude, no pillar of restraint.This is someone who once joked to Howard Stern \u2014 on the air \u2014 that his own Vietnam was the danger he courted as a libidinous man in an era of sexually transmitted diseases. This is someone who publicly drooled over his daughter Ivanka, saying that he might date her if he hadn\u2019t sired her.Weiner sent strangers pictures of his bulge. Trump assured the viewers of a nationally televised debate that he was amply endowed.These impulses \u2014 these boasts \u2014 aren\u2019t unrelated.A scene in the documentary \u201cWeiner,\u201d about his ill-fated run for New York City mayor, depicts him at a computer, raptly watching and reliving one of his appearances on MSNBC. Trump is famous for marinating in all of the television time devoted to him. He tallies it. He crows about it. He\u2019s Weiner with extra traction, Weiner with added gilt.It forces an important question: Have we constructed a politics with such bright, invasive lights that those who find it more attractive than repulsive include an unhealthy number of insecure exhibitionists out for affirmation above all else?Advertisement"}

But their views on the food chain evolved and, in the end, karma knocked.The threats have subsided, and now there is little sign of distress at their restaurants in Southern California.Servers continue to take diners their entrees accompanied with an ever-changing daily question. They have asked, \u201cWhat is your gift to give?\u201d and, \u201cWhat brings you joy?\u201dThe implication is that the restaurant is a sliver of nirvana.

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "When nearly 300 Nigerian schoolgirls were kidnapped in April 2014, a social media campaign, #BringBackOurGirls, quickly went viral, drawing the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention to the militant group claiming responsibility, Boko Haram.Yet two years later, Boko Haram\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign of terror in Nigeria continues. About two million Nigerians have been displaced after attacks on their villages. More than 200 of the missing schoolgirls remain captive. With the trending hashtags vanished and news coverage now minimal, it seems that the rest of the world has moved on.But the photographer Bryan Anselm has not. He recently spent  two weeks in Nigeria, visiting unofficial settlements that house citizens displaced by Boko Haram. A look back at Lens coverage of the #bringbackourgirls campaign.When documenting international conflict, he isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t interested in violence. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m more interested in how it affects people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Anselm said.  His trip came nearly a year after Nigerian officials claimed that all of the terrorist organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s camps had been destroyed. But Mr. Anselm said things were far from calm: Violence still springs up and Boko Haram continues to operate in remote areas, leaving many displaced citizens despairing of returning home \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not that much remains to greet them. Boko Haram often invaded villages at night, burning down homes and executing village leaders. To save themselves, villagers would flee at the sound of gunfire, leaving behind their possessions, clothes and family. It is common to find a father in a settlement camp in the northwest part of the country, a mother in the east and their child in the south \u00e2\u0080\u0094 all parties unaware whether the others are alive. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmotionally these people are alone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Anselm said of the men, women and children he came in contact with while traveling between settlements in central Nigeria. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are vacant. Their trauma is so evident.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In one of Mr. Anselm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s photographs, a young man who has lost his family sits despondent on a tattered couch. His slumped shoulders and gaze to the floor say a million words about the emotions he contends with. Two photos laid side by side capture dispirited movements of a woman who shifts in her seat as she looks up and into Mr. Anselm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lens. Other blurred photos depict the rare pictures of loved ones that some in camps were able to take with them and represent fading memories most struggle to hold onto. One mother told Mr. Anselm she had trouble remembering what her lost daughter looked like. It is these small, painful details that Mr. Anselm seeks to highlight. \u00e2\u0080\u009cExpressing their trauma is important,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, noting that too often the news media flock to troubled countries during insurgencies or wars to cover the violence and leave once it is over. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey skip the years and years of time it takes people to recover from it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  The settlements where he spent time are among the many that house hundreds of displaced Nigerians who survive day to day without aid from the government or organizations that say it is too dangerous to deliver food or resources to them.  More than 50,000 children in one state of Nigeria, a recent Unicef report estimates, will soon die as a result of a lack of access to food or medical attention. According to Mr. Anselm, those who work in aid organizations and the roughly 10 percent of displaced citizens lucky to reside in government-supported settlement camps have hope that conditions will improve and they will one day return home. But those who are scraping by separated from family and stripped of possessions in remote settlements like those in his photographs are less optimistic. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey realize their life will never be the way it once was,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.

{"Headline": "It\u2019s So Typical", "Date": "2016-08-17", "News": "Supported byWordplayTHURSDAY PUZZLE \u2014 Have you ever stared at a word for so long that it stops looking like that word and starts to look like a completely different word?Parker Lewis has demonstrated a love for slicing, dicing and scrambling words in the four crossword puzzles that have run in The New York Times under his byline, and I have become a big fan.Today he collaborates with Jeff Chen of XWord Info to offer us a puzzle that might require two or more glances at the theme entries to uncover the trick, but it\u2019s well worth your time. I know that it had me snorting all the way through.Today\u2019s three theme clues at 17-, 36- and 53A might seem kind of stretchy, but they actually describe the goings-on in the theme pretty well.If you take a fairly long word like RECONSIDERATION (17A) and slice it up into three parts, what you wind up with (that still makes sense) is RECON SIDE RATION. That sums up \u201cNot the main food allotment for one on an intel mission?\u201d Now you slice up the other two theme entries, and you should wind of with a set of the following:17A: RECONSIDERATION = RECON SIDE RATION [\u201cNot the main food allotment for one on an intel mission?\u201d]36A: TEMPERAMENTALLY = TEMPE RAMEN TALLY [\u201cNoodle count in one of Arizona\u2019s largest cities?\u201d]53A: NONCOMMUNICABLE = NONCOM MUNI CABLE [\u201cSarge\u2019s \u2018Sell my city bonds!\u2019 telegram?\u201d]As I would have expected from a Lewis-Chen puzzle, there is a lot of good stuff in the puzzle outside the theme. The constructors introduced eight entries today (including two of the theme entries) and, in non-debut news, I liked IDRIS Elba, MYST, LOOK IT UP, DAILY PLANET, SPRAY TAN, BLIND ALLEYS, SURE DO, WET MARTINIS (I like them any way I can get them), HONEYMOONED and ROSHAMBO.\u2022 10A: Remember: Abbreviated clue means an abbreviated entry, so \u201cCorp. recruiters\u2019 targets\u201d would be M.B.A.S.\u2022 15A: One of the founders of the NAACP was a suffragist and civil rights activist named Mary White Ovington. Ms. Ovington grew up in a family that supported women\u2019s rights and had been part of the antislavery movement. When I first solved this, I wished that the clue had credited one of the black founders, like W.E.B. DuBois, but Mr. DuBois has been used in clues a number of times. My best guess about this is that an attempt was made to come up with a fresh clue.\u202222A: I have this theory that for every moment in life there is an equivalent \u201cSeinfeld\u201d moment, so I truly wanted the answer to \u201cLike the cinnamon in babka\u201d this to be LESSER, as in \u201clesser babka\u201d:\u2022 2D: Hands up if you had RAH before OL\u00c9 for the \u201cTwo-syllable cheer.\u201d\u2022 24D: I loved this clue. \u201cDid a tour after joining up?\u201d sounds like someone enlisted in the military, but we\u2019ve been misdirected: you can also join up in wedded bliss and go on your honeymoon.\u2022 27D: More misdirection! \u201cBiblical mount\u201d suggests a mountain like Ararat, but today we\u2019re thinking about mounts that someone can ride, like a CAMEL.\u2022 56D: I stared at this one for a while before I understood why the answer to \u201cBe on the level?\u201d is LIE. I\u2019m thinking that if you\u2019re lying down (horizontal), you\u2019re basically level. What do you think?We each took a crack at finding 15-letter words that could be split into 5/5/5 or 4/5/6 or 4/4/7. After sifting through a bunch of junk, we settled on these three. Here are a few alternates that didn\u2019t quite make the cut:HYPER/CRITIC/ALLYINTER/MEDIA/TINGTOUGH/MINDED/NESSLIEU/TENANTS/HIPSAPP/RENT/ICES/HIPSSTAND/OF/FISH/NESSThe first version we submitted included the revealer THE SPLITS clued as [Show of flexibility ... and what 16\u2212, 25\u2212, and 40\u2212Across each do]. It was deemed to be not such a great addition to the main theme so we decided to rework the puzzle. With only three theme entries, we tried to construct a wide-open grid with as much fresh fill as possible. Hope you all enjoy the result.And, as many others have said, it\u2019s a great pleasure to work with Jeff!Both of us are recreational programmers (me much hackier than Parker, who actually works in the field). It occurred to me that his TEMPE/RAMEN/TALLY seed idea might be a fun project to expand my coding skills, and after a few attempts, I figured out a way to at least narrow down my list into a subset that might be reasonably human-scannable.Et voila, the other two popped out! (After about 10 hours of line-by-line searching.) HYPER CRITIC ALLY was also a possibility, but it wasn\u2019t nearly as nice, as it didn\u2019t change the \u201ccritic\u201d meaning at all.To the credit of Parker and his programming skills, he came up with these ... and a bunch of others (mentioned above). Shows you what I know.Nicely done, Mr. Lewis and Mr. Chen.Your thoughts?Join us as we crush the Thursday puzzle each week on The New York Times\u2019s Facebook page:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Concerns Over Rule Banning Sex Offenders From Playing Pok\u00e9mon Go", "Date": "2016-08-21", "News": "Supported byThe list that most sex offenders must sign in order to be granted parole in New York State includes many stipulations, all written in the first person. There are promises to register with local law enforcement, to complete therapy if it is required and to not pick up hitchhikers or visit schools or playgrounds.And at the end there is a new entry: no Pok\u00e9mon Go.\u201cI understand that I shall not download, access, or otherwise engage in any internet-enabled gaming activities to include Pok\u00e9mon Go,\u201d it reads.The appearance of the popular smartphone game \u2014 in which players catch Pok\u00e9mon, digital creatures with names such as Squirtle and Jigglypuff \u2014 on the gloomy bureaucratic document was not a joke or a prank. It was a serious policy enacted by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, this month to protect children who play games over the internet.But advocates for civil liberties said they were skeptical of whether the new stipulation, which would apply to about 3,000 paroled sex offenders in the state, was appropriate.Pok\u00e9mon Go takes the form of a treasure hunt, with a digital map on a cellphone leading a player to real locations \u2014 many of them landmarks \u2014 to try to collect Pok\u00e9mon characters. The augmented reality game splices a digital layer onto the physical world: Pok\u00e9mon appear based on a player\u2019s physical location, and the cartoon creatures are seen through the phone\u2019s camera, creating an image that melds the virtual to the real \u2014 a smiley Bulbasaur near a Central Park fountain, for example.But to State Senators Jeffrey D. Klein and Diane J. Savino, both Democrats, it presented \u201ca virtual road map to our children,\u201d Mr. Klein said in a news release. In an informal investigation, they looked at 100 addresses of registered sex offenders across New York City and found Pok\u00e9mon near 57 of them. And they highlighted an instance in Indiana in which a sex offender was reportedly caught playing the game with a 16-year-old.Mr. Cuomo, in a statement explaining that the order was inspired by the investigation, said, \u201cThese actions will provide safeguards\u201d and \u201chelp take one more tool away from those seeking to do harm to our children.\u201dMr. Cuomo\u2019s office said that the game\u2019s \u201clure\u201d feature, which allows players to attract more Pok\u00e9mon to certain locations, \u201cappears to have the potential to be abused by predators.\u201dStill, Alphonso David, the governor\u2019s chief counsel, said, \u201cWhat we can\u2019t do is suggest that a percentage of children \u2014 even if it\u2019s a small percentage of children \u2014 can\u2019t be protected.\u201dThe list of so-called special conditions to which Pok\u00e9mon Go was added includes prohibitions on parolees owning cameras or cellphones, using the internet or driving anywhere besides work. If parolees, who are subject to unscheduled searches of their home and devices, break any of these provisions, they could end up back in prison. Parole officers can grant dispensation on some of the conditions case by case.\u201cI think that the anonymity of apps like Kik, Snapchat, Instagram and Pok\u00e9mon Go does increase the risk for opportunistic offenders,\u201d she said.Finn Brunton, an assistant professor of media at New York University, described the game as part of a wave of new technology that is breaking down the boundary between real and virtual worlds in unpredictable ways. \u201cCyberspace \u2014 you think of it being this other place, but it\u2019s not that at all anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s the world that surrounds us.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Uzbekistan\u2019s Ruler Gravely Ill, Questions Arise on Succession", "Date": "2016-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLater on Monday, Ferghana, an Uzbek website banned at home since 2005, reported that Mr. Karimov had died in the afternoon, citing sources outside the government. The report was widely repeated by independent news outlets in Russia.There was no official confirmation, however, and Russian outlets, such as the state-run RIA Novosti agency, quoted unidentified government officials in Uzbekistan as saying that the president remained alive and in stable condition.The nightly news on the main Uzbekistan television channel did not refer to the story at all, mentioning the president as the active leader.Under the Constitution, upon Mr. Karimov\u2019s death, the head of Uzbekistan\u2019s Senate would run the country for three months to allow for new presidential elections. Presidential elections in Uzbekistan have always come with a known outcome.With no son or obvious successor, the announcement that Mr. Karimov, 78, was gravely ill, or perhaps dead, immediately focused attention on who might succeed him.\u201cThis is the question that worries everybody now,\u201d Mr. Kislov said. No successor is likely to replace the secret police as the central power in the country, he predicted.\u201cIslam Karimov has built a very stable system of power, which is based on the power of the special services,\u201d Mr. Kislov said in an interview. \u201cRegardless of who is the main person in the country, the real power will be with the special services.\u201dAmid the conflicting accounts on Monday, there was no indication of public unrest or even disquiet in Uzbekistan, the largest country in Central Asia by far, with more than 31 million people.The way the announcement was made, however, indicated that Mr. Karimov was in grave condition. For the first time ever, the government issued a statement about his health, reporting on Sunday that the president had been hospitalized without providing any details.Then on Monday, his younger daughter, Lola Karimova-Tillyaeva, 38, the Uzbek ambassador to Unesco in Paris, posted her announcement on Facebook in Uzbek, Russian and English.\u201cI would like to write here about the sad events that befell our family last weekend,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMy father was hospitalized after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage on Saturday morning, and is now receiving treatment in an intensive-care unit.\u201dMs. Karimova-Tillyaeva said that her father was in stable condition and that it was too early for a prognosis. She asked for privacy, prayers and for \u201ceveryone to refrain from any speculation.\u201dThe announcement prompted just that, however, given that Mr. Karimov has avoided appointing a successor.Under investigation in Europe and the United States on suspicion of accepting hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes in connection with telecom licenses in Uzbekistan, Ms. Karimova disappeared from public view.In 2014, it was revealed that she had been under house arrest for at least a year, with various associates arrested and jailed. She remains at home under guard.Mr. Karimov\u2019s wife, Tatyana Karimova, and Rustam Inoyatov, the head of the secret police, are expected to be hugely influential in the choice of a successor, but are unlikely to take such a public role themselves.Prime Minister Shavkat Mirziyoev, seen as a Kremlin ally, is a more likely consensus candidate within a small ruling circle, as is Rustam Azimov, a deputy prime minister and finance minister.Mr. Karimov, first appointed to run Uzbekistan in 1989 when it was still part of the Soviet Union, won an election to continue as president after it collapsed in 1991.The massacre prompted Europe and the United States to distance themselves from Mr. Karimov for a time, and the United States imposed military sanctions. But Uzbekistan was a crucial supplier for Western troops propping up the government in Afghanistan against the Taliban, so ties were restored within a few years and remain stable.\u201cKarimov is known for being one of the wiliest, most ruthless authoritarian rulers, not only in the post-Soviet space but in the entire world,\u201d said Steve Swerdlow, the director of Central Asia research at Human Rights Watch.The stability of Uzbekistan, the crossroads of Central Asia, is important to Russia, China and the United States. Some Uzbeks have turned up among the Islamic State fighters in the Middle East, but they are not considered a serious threat at home.In Moscow, Dmitry S. Peskov, the presidential spokesman, wished Mr. Karimov a speedy recovery. He said it was not appropriate to speculate about the future of the country should Mr. Karimov die, according to the Interfax news agency.Mr. Karimov has kept some distance from Moscow as well as from his neighbors, yet rules in a manner learned from his past as a Soviet official. Every year, for example, an estimated million Uzbeks are forced to leave their regular lives for a month to help with the public cotton harvest.In another annual rite, Mr. Karimov shows up at the public celebrations of independence day on Sept. 1 to glad-hand the crowd and perform a traditional national dance. It is, analysts noted, his way of showing the public that he is in good health.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Israel\u2019s Modern-Orthodox Jews Came Out of the Closet", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 On July 21, a young Israeli woman posted an account on Facebook about falling in love with another woman. The young woman comes from a modern-Orthodox Jewish family. She had been hoping to have a traditional Orthodox family life \u2014 a husband and several children living in a community adhering to Jewish law. Yet after a decade of searching for love, she ended up finding it where she least expected. Her true love came tangled up with the heartbreaking realization that everything she was hoping for \u2014 the husband, the children, the community \u2014 was not going to happen the way she envisioned it.That young woman is my sister.It\u2019s no surprise that these remarks were met with dismay by Israel\u2019s secular, liberal communities. Somewhat more surprising was the criticism emanating from modern-Orthodox rabbis, political leaders and citizens. Naftali Bennett, the education minister and head of the Zionist-Orthodox Jewish Home party, was quick to reject Rabbi Levenstein\u2019s comments, which were \u201cnot the way of religious Zionism,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t insult an entire sector of the public and hide behind Jewish law.\u201dTo be sure, not all modern-Orthodox Israelis agreed about the rabbi\u2019s offensive remarks. The sudden wall-to-wall condemnation of his statements prompted many of his colleagues and some of his constituency to rush to his defense. More than 300 rabbis signed a letter backing \u201cevery rabbi who expresses his Halachic and moral view.\u201d (Halachic refers to Jewish religious law.) Yet even this letter was somewhat reluctant to endorse Rabbi Levenstein\u2019s harsh language.But Rabbi Levenstein\u2019s outburst and the rabbis\u2019 petition were evidence to the contrary: They showed that the rabbinical establishment is in distress. The military is educating its soldiers to be tolerant of the L.G.B.T. community. The legal system is ruling in favor of equal rights for L.G.B.T. couples. And when a rabbi decides to cry foul, and remind his listeners that Jewish law has a clear-cut view against homosexuality, he is portrayed as a bigot and gets harsh condemnations from almost every quarter.What the \u201cperverts\u201d incident proved is that not even the people who supposedly share the rabbis\u2019 view that according to Jewish law homosexuality is an abomination are willing to tolerate hateful language. Not even those who rightly insist that rabbis ought not always be subjected to the rules of political correctness accept attempts to humiliate fellow Israelis. And why would they tolerate it? These gay people are not outcasts. They are our neighbors, friends, colleagues and families. My family.Rabbi Levenstein miscalculated: He thought he was drawing a line against sexual permissiveness. He ended up forcing the modern-Orthodox community to draw a line against rabbinical small-mindedness.Shmuel Rosner is the political editor at The Jewish Journal, a senior fellow at the Jewish People Policy Institute and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Poker Game, a Missing Gun and a Mayor Divide Stockton, California", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "Supported byFirst, the residents of Stockton, Calif., learned that their mayor was the owner of a stolen gun linked to a homicide. Days later, he was arrested at a camp he runs for disadvantaged youths, accused of secretly recording teenagers playing strip poker, providing alcohol to minors and endangering children there a year earlier.Those were the latest in a string of episodes that have placed Stockton\u2019s mayor, Anthony Silva, under intense scrutiny, upending a Northern California community of nearly 300,000 people that is already struggling to repair wounds inflicted by violent crime and the 2008 foreclosure crisis.On Tuesday night, a packed City Council meeting began with cheers for the mayor, and included more than a dozen speakers who came to his defense.Days before the mayor\u2019s Aug. 4 arrest at the camp, a document released by the district attorney\u2019s office in San Joaquin County showed that a gun registered to Mr. Silva \u2014 one he had reported stolen \u2014 had been linked to a 2015 homicide: the death of a 13-year-old boy, Rayshawn Harris.Nearly a month after the boy was fatally shot, Mr. Silva reported the gun had been stolen from a home he owned, according to the Stockton Police Department. Mr. Silva, 41, was not accused of criminal wrongdoing in the gun case. But the boy\u2019s father, Willis Harris, questioned why the mayor had waited several weeks to make a report. \u201cI\u2019m just really tore up right now,\u201d said Mr. Harris, 60, in an interview. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he report it? My child could still be here.\u201dAt a news conference on Aug. 5, after his release on $20,000 bail, the mayor proclaimed his innocence of the camp-related charges.\u201cOne, everyone there was 18 years old,\u201d Mr. Silva said. \u201cNo. 2, I have never ever, ever, ever endangered a child. Ever.\u201dBut that assertion did not satisfy some of the mayor\u2019s critics. \u201cWhat is the mayor doing playing strip poker with 18-year-olds?\u201d said Michael Blower, 48, a City Council member and lifelong resident of Stockton. \u201cWhether or not he\u2019s guilty of all the crimes he\u2019s charged with, he\u2019s certainly guilty of poor judgment. And I just want my city to be able to heal, move on from this.\u201dIn an interview, a lawyer for Mr. Silva, Mark Reichel said that his client would ultimately be cleared of the charges. \u201cThey forced these kids to say this stuff,\u201d Mr. Reichel said, accusing local and federal investigators of pressuring minors into saying they were naked and drinking as Mr. Silva recorded. \u201cThey are drunk with power.\u201dMr. Silva was elected in 2012, calling himself the \u201cpeople\u2019s mayor\u201d and pledging to restore the city\u2019s reputation. A former chairman of the school board in Stockton, he also led the local Boys & Girls Club and has been active in a nonprofit organization called the Stockton Kids Club.Mr. Silva has run a sleep-away camp for a number of years, inviting at-risk youths for a week of bonfires and water sports. Campers, ages 7 to 17, sleep in cabins and can participate in a talent show. Parents pay on a sliding scale, with support from the Stockton Kids Club.Mr. Silva is running for re-election in Stockton against Michael Tubbs, 26, a City Council member who, in 2014, pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of driving under the influence. Mr. Tubbs did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Silva\u2019s lawyer said the mayor had waited to report the absence of the pistol and another gun because he was unsure whether the firearms had been stolen or misplaced.Others, however, say they have lost faith in the man they elected to lead them.\u201cWe already have a pretty tainted view of our city,\u201d said Andie Garvin, 35, a Stockton resident who once campaigned for Mr. Silva but now wants him out. \u201cIt seems like we\u2019re making strides, and then something like this comes out and it just knocks us 10 steps back.\u201dSusan C. Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Letters to the Editor", "Date": "2016-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u2018The Fall of Heaven\u2019To the Editor:Who decides what is history and what is not? And who gets to write it?Your reviewer chose to dismiss or overlook important new revelations concerning the disappearance of Imam Musa Sadr, a towering figure in 20th-century Shiism; documents revealing the flow of weapons and cash from Arab leaders and terrorist groups to the Khomeini movement; the disclosure that United States diplomats were in close contact with Iranian opposition leaders; that senior Muslim clerics opposed Khomeini and begged the shah to end his rebellion; and that the shah repeatedly, and over the strong objections of his top army brass, refused to sanction the crackdown that might have saved his throne but led to bloodshed.The contributions of non-Iranian scholars to the debate on the Pahlavi era should not be dismissed out of hand. As outsiders, we bring to the discussion a different way of thinking and new tools in research and analysis. We can say things in public that many Iranian intellectuals will only admit to in private. During my trip to Iran to study Shiism as part of book research \u2014 a fact left out of Moaveni\u2019s review \u2014 I experienced firsthand just how popular the shah and his family are with many ordinary Iranians.This book will, I hope, shake up a historical narrative that for too long has felt too settled. \u201cBlunt histories do not always meet with warm approval,\u201d the historian Margaret MacMillan writes. Those who \u201cproduce work that challenges deeply held beliefs and myths about the past\u201d are often accused of \u201cbeing elitist, nihilistic or simply out of touch with that imaginary place \u2018the real world.\u2019\u200a\u201d Let\u2019s make sure that everyone\u2019s voice counts in this debate. No single person or group \u201cowns\u201d history, and all views and contributions should be welcome.ANDREW SCOTT COOPERBROOKLYN\u2b25To the Editor:I appreciated Azadeh Moaveni\u2019s incisive review of Andrew Scott Cooper\u2019s attempted whitewash of the shah of Iran. Nevertheless, Moaveni is too credulous of Cooper\u2019s allegations that President Jimmy Carter opposed and exaggerated the shah\u2019s human rights abuses.While Carter claimed that human rights would underscore his foreign policy, he effusively praised the shah. During a visit by the Iranian leader to the White House, Carter referred to the Iranian dictator\u2019s \u201cenlightened leadership\u201d and \u201creaffirmed to His Majesty that he fully supports the special relationship\u201d between the two nations \u2014 a relationship characterized in large part by the sale of weapons in one direction and oil in the other.Carter topped even these fulsome tributes a month later in Tehran, declaring, in a mind-numbing misreading of historical momentum: \u201cIran, because of the great leadership of the shah, is an island of stability in one of the more troubled areas of the world.\u201d As Iranian opposition to the shah mounted, the president saw only \u201cthe admiration and love which your people give to you,\u201d adding: \u201cThere is no leader with whom I have a deeper sense of personal gratitude and personal friendship.\u201dTo be sure, some Carter administration officials did take the president\u2019s human rights rhetoric seriously, criticizing the shah for widespread imprisonment and torture of opponents. But Carter for most of his presidency publicly backed this tyrant, ensuring that those who deposed him would direct their ire against the United States as well \u2014 helping to inaugurate 40 years of U.S.-\u00adIranian antagonism, which Presidents Obama and Rouhani have only recently begun to overcome.ROBERT SHAFFERSHIPPENSBURG, PA.The writer is a professor of history at Shippensburg University. \u2b25Is This the Place?To the Editor:If one types \u201cThis Must Be the Place\u201d in Google, information about the movie and the song are the first hits.

{"Headline": "What Disability Means", "Date": "2016-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDisabilityI was diagnosed with a degenerative disability early in life, but appeared able-bodied and mostly \u201cfit in\u201d \u2014 physically, at least. As an adult, I became a wheelchair user, and the world changed around me. It took me a long time to find my tribe and acknowledge my disability identity \u2014 I now proudly identify as crip, and fight for the rights of my fellow crips.It surprised me how sitting down and using a mobility aid changed the way others viewed me. I\u2019d gone from being a well regarded professional to a marginalized and oppressed member of a minority group. When my workplace refused to build an accessible toilet, I had few options available to me, and my doctor told me to change my tampon in my office, with the door locked. People looked at me differently, as though I was not one of them \u2014 they jumped out of my way or apologized to me in shopping centers, even when they were well out of range. My experience as a non-walking person could not have been more different from my experience as a biped, even when I was on crutches.There was no place for me to find out about crip pride, about disability identity \u2014 no cultural spaces, no parades or events. We\u2019ve started creating \u201ccrip cultural spaces\u201d in Australia, with zines and radical self-love cards. It\u2019s how we make change, when we realize that the social model of disability makes sense and that mobilizing our forces is the only way we will cure oppression and marginalization. I\u2019m proud to be part of a rock star community of activists in my country.One assumption is that we are looking for sympathy. Wrong. Take your pity, sympathy and the inspiration you get from our \u201cbrave fight\u201d someplace else.Another theme is that we are trying game the S.S.D.I. system. Please. As others have pointed out, getting through that process is hardly a walk in the park, and after that you may get a whopping $1,200 a month, MAX (which is taxable income BTW). Try living in any urban area that is likely to have the infrastructure that makes living with a disability tolerable on the money you get from S.S.D.I. Please.Growing up, I was one of the only visibly disabled people in my public grade school and high school. Since my friends were all abled, as is my family, I never considered \u201cdisabled\u201d as an identity. Thanks to the annual M.D.A. telethons, I thought disability was something to be ashamed of, or a weakness \u2014 that everyone with a disability wanted to be fixed, and that wasn\u2019t me at all. I loved who I was, and had pride in my identity even if I didn\u2019t recognize it in that way.Social media and the internet changed things for me. I was able to connect with other disabled individuals and see how they felt about their identity. In college, I read every book I could on feminism, which led me to books and articles on the disability rights movement. I found communities online where there were heated and engaging conversations about what it means to have a disability in a world that isn\u2019t built with us in mind. That\u2019s when I proudly labeled myself disabled.There are certain symptoms of my disabilities that I have difficulty navigating: the pain, the anxiety, and breathing problems. But would I change who I am \u2014 would I take away my disability? No. Being disabled is too linked to my humanity, to my empathy, and my strength. It dictates my relationships with others. What I\u2019ve experienced in life is a story worth telling, and a road worth following, despite how society tries to tell us otherwise. I would proudly live this life again if I could.I would say that, if we\u2019re thinking specifically about psychiatric disabilities, there is no \u201cpride movement\u201d because of the shame and stigma that still exist around psychiatric illnesses (and other disabilities). I mean, who wants to be visible when so many still think of depression/bipolar as character flaws and when illnesses like schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder are so pathologized, even criminalized?A funny thing happened to me in the grocery store last week. I\u2019m quadriplegic and, at best, about 4\u2019 7\u201d in my chair; I loathe asking for help in getting things from the top shelf in the store. While checking out some fresh corn, a blue-haired woman, about 4\u2019 2\u201d offered to hand me the low corn if I\u2019d hand her the high corn. Perspective is a funny thing.First, I feel a tremendous pull to start by mentioning how refreshing to see this being talked about (even more so, being talked about in The New York Times).I\u2019m a 29-year-old who was once given a life expectancy of 13. Fifty-three surgeries, countless long-term hospital and rehabilitation stays have been the \u201cnorm\u201d in my life. I often discuss with my partner the disconnect between my queer and disabled identities. How I seem to have developed a sense of pride in being queer, but often reject any identity pertaining to disability. I\u2019ve begun to try to weave the two together and noticed that when doing so, I\u2019m more comfortable introducing disability into queer spaces, than I am introducing queerness into disability-related spaces. The two feel contradictory, but inside I know they shouldn\u2019t. What I do know, or at least believe to be true, is that disability remains invisible and/or hard for able-bodied people to look at, because unlike racial, cultural, or sexual identities, it is an identity that any able-bodied person could possibly face. And let\u2019s be honest, that\u2019s scary. Most identities are set in stone. You are heterosexual or you are not. You are a person of color or you are not. Disability is something that can happen to any person at any time \u2014 and that\u2019s a reality that\u2019s hard to face. It\u2019s hard to face when you are disabled, why wouldn\u2019t it be hard to face when you are able-bodied and aware that you could become disabled?I am so grateful for this being talked about. I think visibility is always productive. I think taking pride in ourselves, our abilities, and our resilience is impossible without it.Thank you for a pleasant morning read, to both the author, and The New York Times.As a divorced, working mother struggling with multiple sclerosis, I\u2019d never seek to find pride in the label \u201cdisabled.\u201d Maybe it is just me, but I already feel proud that I am able to drag (sometimes literally) myself out of bed and provide for myself and my children. Watching my children flourish is all the adulation I need. I don\u2019t feel the need to draw additional attention to my \u201cdisability.\u201d Most days, I just want to feel \u201cnormal.\u201d But, maybe that\u2019s just me.I have been a wheelchair user since I broke my neck in a fall and sustained a spinal cord injury in 1976 at the age of 18. In the months following my accident in the rehab hospital, while I struggled to adjust, I also met some truly good people learning how to survive with a spinal cord injury, and I learned from them. After I got out of rehab, I just tried to get on with my life, going back to college, learning how to drive a car with hand controls, etc. But I mostly avoided making any close connections with other people with disabilities. You could say I was in denial about being disabled, and all of its ramifications. Then, I was very fortunate to have been introduced to the disability rights movement in the early 1980s, working at an independent living center. Learning how to be a strong advocate for the rights of people with disabilities eventually became a career. Learning about the various forms of ableism and discrimination faced by my friends and colleagues with disabilities, and how to effectively fight this oppression, ultimately has changed my life. A lot has changed over the past 40 years, both for me and for many of the 56 million Americans with disabilities. The passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990 was truly a milestone, and has led to great improvements in accessibility and opportunity for things that many nondisabled people take for granted: education, employment, housing, and transportation, just to name a few. But many people with disabilities still face rampant discrimination and misunderstanding. I will not stop working until ableism is eradicated.The gay pride movement of the \u201880s was full of able-bodied young men, many of them with good jobs. They had leisure and strength to make a social movement.Disabled people tend to be, how shall I say, *disabled.* Some are chronically ill, which doesn\u2019t lend itself to sustained activism. Some have other types of limitations which prevent regular work, which also chops up sustained activism. Most disabled people are poor, because disability in this country is criminally expensive.Why aren\u2019t they making a pride movement, in other words? Maybe getting by day to day is more important. Living. Surviving. Avoiding more pain, living within what are often narrow physical, mental, and financial constraints.Other people will have to be heavily involved in any such movement. And that\u2019s the problem.Nervous. That\u2019s how people act when they learn that I\u2019m legally blind. They hear the word \u201cdisabled,\u201d and, suddenly, they become anxious. They start speaking cautiously, as though they\u2019re worried they\u2019ll offend me, or that, somehow, I won\u2019t understand them. This is most apparent with my teachers. Back in high school, and even now in college, my teachers acted super antsy around me. They constantly asked me if I was O.K.; if I got what was happening. The reason for this was that they\u2019d never met a disabled person before, and therefore didn\u2019t know how to act around me. See, to them, disabled kids were the ones who got hidden away in \u201cspecial\u201d classrooms. They were the unfortunate and embarrassing mistakes that needed to be swept under the rug. What my teachers, and every ignorant, uninformed person who thinks this way, don\u2019t seem to understand is, even with a disability, I am still very much a person. I am capable of loving, laughing, crying and learning. I have a full range of emotions and beliefs, and am perfectly capable of thinking for myself. All I need are a few accommodations, and, as long as I get them, there\u2019s no problem, or reason to discuss my condition. I tried to prove this to people by getting perfect grades, acting in theater productions, and joining tons of clubs. But that never seemed to make any difference. I was still, first and foremost, \u201cthe blind kid.\u201d And, to be perfectly honest, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be anything but \u201cthe blind kid\u201d to other people until we start changing the narrative; the narrative that persons with disabilities are defined solely by their disability; that their disability somehow diminishes their personhood. Yes, physical and mental disabilities are and can be very serious. But there\u2019s a substantial difference between acknowledging that someone needs a little bit of help, and making them out as sad, sorry pitiful creatures who need to be hidden from \u201cnormal\u201d people. And the sooner we stop doing that, the less nervous everyone will be.I have an unusual disability, I\u2019m anosmic. After my olfactory meningioma tumor was removed, I lost my sense of smell. While I would say that as disabilities go, this one is not too hard to live with, it\u2019s amazing how many people tell me \u201cit\u2019s nothing\u201d or even \u201cyou are lucky.\u201d It took me two years to get over the shock of the loss of my olfactory window on the universe. Eating, playing or just taking a walk down the street after a spring rain are not the same, not to mention losing the unique smell of my loved ones. Odors are emotional, which is why we are uncomfortable talking about them. Enjoy those smells, the nasty with the nice, you don\u2019t know how lucky you are.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "Doug Mills is photographing the Rio Olympics for The New York Times. He joined The Times in 2002 after working for The Associated Press and has shot almost every Olympics since the 1992 Winter Games. Based in Washington, Doug covers the White House when not photographing athletes.He spoke with James Estrin by telephone from Rio de Janeiro. The conversation has been edited for brevity and clarity.Are there any similarities between a great political photo and a great sports photo?When you go to a sporting event you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for the peak of action \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the ultimate storytelling photo. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that one moment that shows the readers what it was really like.Elections are very similar. In any given day, the election could change. Everybody thinks of Election Day being the final day of the race, when in fact every day is a do-or-die day where something could happen \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or go wrong \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that could change the face of the election.You look for peak moments in each event. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to take the best picture.On the New York primary night event with Hillary Clinton, that was like the Michael Phelps moment for me: She came out onstage and my overhead remote picture of her looking down captured something.Both the Olympics and in politics, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very stage-managed events.The sporting events here are all are staged for TV. Politics is also as much stagecraft as possible. But there are moments that are unscripted, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s President Obama, Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. They are real people and they have real emotions and only so much of it can be controlled by the handlers or themselves.What is your role in the process while they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re winning and losing in politics or sports?My role is to make the best moment from every event that I go to. To allow the readers to see the moment that may not be seen on TV, or the moment that may not even be seen by a lot of people who are at the events.What is it that you really are looking for in an Olympics photo?Well, it really is the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re watching somebody compete, someone who has trained all their life and dreamed of being here all their life.The emotions are right out there, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re raw and you can capture them.You see it every day here at the Olympics in every event you go to. Every finals match, every gold medal match, there is so much emotion and you feel it in the stands and you hear it in the crowds all loud. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an amazing feeling to be here.That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good question. I probably have. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve definitely shot most if not all of them. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s amazing to think that any one individual could win 23 gold medals when the life dream of most people who come to the Olympics is just to win one. Michael Phelps is just a freak of nature. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stayed in shape and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stayed focused.Every gold medal is different, too.That was the highlight so far of the track and field for photographers. I spent most of that day setting up my five remote cameras. The front-page photo and the double truck inside came from my remotes.How has this Olympic experience been for you so far?For me personally it\u2019s been great. The weather has been great. The transportation has been horrible. Most of the photo event location managers have been extremely helpful, which is the key to any photographer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s success at an Olympics.It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a lot of fun, but it\u2019s a lot of work \u2014 18 hours a day. I am at this point so sleep deprived that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sort of sleep drunk.You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been very busy on social media.That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true. It adds another hour or so or more to your day. Tweeting and Instagramming. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to do something a little different than what we do normally.That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a first for me. Instagram Stories launched a few days before we got here. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done Snapchat before, so when Kerri MacDonald [a photo editor for social media at The Times] asked, I said I was happy to give it a shot.I got up at sunrise the next morning and went to the beach, just to look around, and then spent the whole day just Instagramming. My friends, family and everybody else got to see what I was doing up close and personal.You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re kind of making a little movie of yourself \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a journal of what your personal experience is. The majority of the people who follow the Olympics only see what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on NBC. But I wanted to give them a little more of the feel of the city and what it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like for a photographer here. I enjoy doing it.I get the impression that despite the ridiculously long hours and really hard work that you really, really like photographing the Olympics.I am a sports junkie, I thrive on the adrenaline, I thrive on being at these big events. Ah, I feel nowhere near the pressure that those athletes do, but we are under pressure to produce, and that just really excites me. I love going to these big events, and I love photographing.I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a sports junkie, but I am also a political junkie. There aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t many people that are both. I love both of them, and I enjoy shooting both of them.My first convention was Reagan in 1984, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been shooting sports my whole career.

{"Headline": "An Epidemic of \u2018Dead Eyes\u2019 in Kashmir as India Uses Pellet Guns on Protesters", "Date": "2016-08-28", "News": "Supported bySRINAGAR, Kashmir \u2014 The street outside is patrolled by riot police officers in camouflage, bracing for the nightly spasm of violence, but it is quiet here inside the operating room. The surgeon\u2019s knife slides into an eyeball as if it were a soft fruit.The patient\u2019s eyelids have been stretched back with a metal clamp, so his eyeball bulges out of glistening pink tissue. The surgeon sits with his back very straight, cutting with tiny movements of his fingers. Every now and then, a thread of blood appears in the patient\u2019s eye socket. The patient is 8 years old.\u201cVery bad,\u201d murmurs the surgeon, Dr. S. Natarajan. But then, all 13 cases he will see today will be very bad.Since mid-July, when the current wave of protests against the Indian military presence started, more than 570 patients have reported to Srinagar\u2019s main government hospital with eyes ruptured by lead pellets, sometimes known as birdshot, fired by security forces armed with pump-action shotguns to disperse crowds.The patients have mutilated retinas, severed optic nerves, irises seeping out like puddles of ink. \u201cDead eyes,\u201d the ophthalmology department\u2019s chief calls them.Every season of popular revolt in Kashmir has its marker.This summer\u2019s protests in the part of Kashmir controlled by India, the most sustained and violent since 2010, caught the authorities in New Delhi unaware. The stone-throwing crowds have no political leaders, put forward no specific demands and metastasized with alarming speed. Around 60 civilians and two members of the security forces have been killed; on each side, thousands have been wounded.But 2016 will almost certainly be remembered as the year of dead eyes. The eye injuries have become such a focus of public anger that last week, in a conciliatory gesture, India\u2019s home minister, Rajnath Singh, promised that the pellet guns, as they are known here, would be replaced by another type of nonlethal weapon in the coming days.\u201cThat 8-year-old boy, he will live for 70 or 80 years,\u201d says the doctor, Afroz Khan. \u201cThe history remains there, even if it is not in the books.\u201dOn July 9, Tariq Qureshi, the head of the ophthalmology department, was at a seminar on pediatric retinal repair.It was the hospital emergency room, calling to let him know that two patients had come in with pellets in their eyes. Dr. Qureshi sent a doctor over, and the seminar resumed. Ten minutes later, the phone rang again. It was the same doctor in the emergency room, telling Dr. Qureshi to come immediately, that the number of patients had risen to 15.The four ophthalmologists, who were across the hospital campus from the emergency room, ran.For the next 72 hours, they operated in shifts around the clock, suturing the eyes to keep the matter inside from leaking out. In most cases, it became clear, the pellets had burst into through the cornea and out through the retina, leaving little hope of fully restoring vision. Twenty-seven patients were hit in both eyes. The pellets, when they could be removed, were preserved on the heads of cotton swabs.\u201cOnce it goes in the eye, it rotates like this, and destroys everything there inside,\u201d Dr. Qureshi said. \u201cIt\u2019s physics. This is a high-velocity body. It releases a high amount of energy inside. The lens, the iris, the retina get matted up.\u201dThe doctors were told to take all possible measures to save their patients\u2019 vision, including complex surgery, at a cost to the government of 70,000 rupees, or around $1,040, per operation, Dr. Qureshi said.He works in a bubble of calm, eyes pressed to a microscope, using his hands to work a cutter and a light, and using his bare feet to control the machines that surround him. On a screen opposite him is an image captured by a microscopic camera inside the boy\u2019s eye. At times the image is cloudy, a flashlight searching in the fog; at one point there are swimming glints of colored light, like those cast by a chandelier in the sun.In cases of catastrophic injuries, Dr. Natarajan\u2019s goal is to save a small portion of the eye\u2019s function, enough to sense light, or movement of a hand.\u201cEven that minor change from zero matters a lot, for a man with no light,\u201d Dr. Natarajan said. \u201cIt is like, if you have no money in your pocket, 10 rupees seems like big money.\u201dSlowly, as residents stood around him in hushed silence, the surgeon flattened out the boy\u2019s retina, as thin and delicate as a lace doily, and used a laser to reattach it to the back of his eye.For an Indian security official, to be engulfed by a hostile crowd in Kashmir is, without a doubt, a life-threatening situation.At sunset on Friday, Bhavesh Chaudhary, the second-in-command of the 161st Battalion of the Central Reserve Police Force, was drinking tea in the camp garden when an officer called with the news that 20 or 30 young men had begun to gather, chanting slogans. He continued drinking tea. The crowd outside kept growing.Then, all of a sudden, Commandant Chaudhary and his troops strapped on helmets and leapt into a column of armored vehicles. As they raced through the neighborhood, masked boys appeared from the left and the right, darting out of alleyways, hurling stones. The troops sent stones rocketing back with small slingshots. The convoy halted at an intersection. Chanting could be heard, coming closer: \u201cWhat do we want? Freedom!\u201dCommandant Chaudhary would spend the next hour and a half trying to push the crowd back. His troops may be heavily armed, but especially at sunset, when they withdraw to their encampments for the night, it is clear to everyone that they are outnumbered.On the streets of Srinagar, which have a ghostly emptiness after 50 days of curfew, people have scrawled, \u201cIndian dogs,\u201d \u201cGo India, go back,\u201d \u201cWe love Pakistan\u201d and \u201cBurhan is alive in our hearts.\u201dCommandant Chaudhary has dedicated much of his career to battling stone-throwing crowds. He knows the current of excitement that will surge through them if they see his forces retreat even a few feet \u2014 or, more powerfully, if they see an officer fall. If the stone-throwers managed to reach the camp, he said, they would set it on fire.\u201cThey are not afraid, that is the thing,\u201d he said of the protesters. \u201cOnce somebody has put on a uniform and picked up a weapon, the law should be maintained, just because the person is there. That is not happening these days. We lost that in 2010.\u201dIndian troops use pellet guns for crowd control only in Kashmir. They were introduced in 2010, halfway through a particularly bloody season of protest. Pellet guns have been used to break up protests in Egypt, Bahrain and Tunisia, but most countries do not use them on unarmed civilians, as the pellets spray widely and cannot be aimed. For Commandant Chaudhary, who sometimes faces crowds of more than 1,000 hostile young men with a contingent of 20 or 30, it is by far the most effective weapon at his disposal.\u201cIt causes bodily injury, so you will be feared,\u201d he said.His battalion commander, Rajesh Yadav, nodded at this assessment. \u201cIf you pinch them,\u201d he said, \u201conly then people will understand.\u201dThis year, the use of pellets on Kashmiri protesters increased sharply, with the police firing more than 3,000 canisters, or upward of 1.2 million pellets, in the first 32 days of the protests, the Central Reserve Police Force has said.Though troops are instructed to aim them below the waist, \u201csometimes it is difficult to go in for precise aimed fire at a moving, bending and running target,\u201d the police explained in response to a lawsuit seeking to ban their use. If they are withdrawn from the arsenal, Commander Yadav said matter-of-factly, troops will have to use their firearms.As for the government hospital, now jammed with injured protesters and sympathetic volunteers, Commander Yadav said it was no longer a safe place for his officers to go. Not long ago, one of his men sought medical help for chest pain but fled in fear of being lynched.In a recovery ward at Shri Maharaja Hari Singh Hospital, a nurse pushes a trolley down a row of beds, distributing cups of tea and slices of white bread to a row of young men in sunglasses.To converse with them is to see new energy coursing into Kashmir\u2019s old cycle of violence. It is difficult to find a patient here who admits to mourning the loss of his eye. They say it is an acceptable price to pay for azadi, or freedom from Indian rule. Quite a few offer to sacrifice their second eye for the cause.Wazira Banwo, 40, is watching her 8-year-old son, Asif Sheikh, recover from surgery. The boy is curled on his side under a blanket, his head swathed in surgical gauze, woozy and sick. It was his third operation; now, with his retina reattached, he may be able to see for a distance of three to five feet, according to Dr. Natarajan.Asked whether she was grateful to the government for providing the child medical care, Ms. Banwo grimaces.\u201cNot a single person from the government has come to help,\u201d she says. \u201cIf any one of them come to me, I will tell them, \u2018You give me your eyes, I will put them in my child.\u2019\u201dMs. Banwo says she often participated in anti-Indian protests herself but discouraged Asif from taking part this summer because of his youth.On the day he was injured, she says, he just happened to be standing in the market when security forces arrived in a van and fired pellet guns.\u201cThis time he is very young,\u201d she says. \u201cBut he will grow. He will understand what happened to him. And he will go out to the street and throw stones.\u201dHari Kumar contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

It makes sense that millennials, the most recorded generation in history, would romanticize the era just before smartphones became ubiquitous. We\u2019re fascinated by documents of life before everything was documented.MTV Classic offers that stuff 24/7.

{"Headline": "Singapore Says It Expects More Zika Cases", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySINGAPORE \u2014 Singapore, which has confirmed several dozen cases of the Zika virus in recent days, expects to identify more previously undiagnosed infections as it steps up measures to halt the spread of the mosquito-borne disease, according to the government.The city-state\u2019s Health Ministry said on Tuesday that it had confirmed 82 Zika cases, up from 56 the previous day. \u201cThe Ministry of Health will continue to work with general practitioners in the area to offer testing for patients who had fever and rash previously,\u201d the ministry said in a statement. \u201cThe look-back exercise will likely uncover more previously undiagnosed cases of Zika.\u201dAt least 36 of the people known to have been infected were foreign workers at a construction site in eastern Singapore, the ministry said. It said the government had inspected about 5,000 premises in the city-state\u2019s east, including the construction site, for mosquito breeding habitats.Why scientists are worried about the growing epidemic and its effects on pregnant women, and how to avoid the infection.The World Health Organization has declared an international emergency over Zika, which has been linked to microcephaly, a birth defect in which babies are born with brain damage and abnormally small heads. The virus has spread explosively in Latin American and the Caribbean.Other Southeast Asian countries besides Singapore have reported Zika cases recently, including Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. Some experts believe that the virus has circulated at low levels in tropical regions of Asia for decades. Starting in the 1950s, clusters of cases were detected from Indonesia to Pakistan. But large outbreaks were not detected, partly because routine Zika tests were never developed for public health laboratories, and because Zika resembles mild cases of other mosquito-borne diseases like dengue and chikungunya.Ooi Eng Eong, a professor and deputy director of the Emerging Infectious Diseases Program at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore, said Tuesday that it was not surprising that the virus was in Singapore, since it is spread by the same mosquito that carries dengue, which is a recurrent problem here.\u201cIn the same way that dengue still spreads in Singapore despite dengue control, I will expect more instances of Zika,\u201d Professor Ooi said. \u201cEspecially when data shows very few of us have the immunity against it, compared to dengue.\u201dSingapore confirmed its first locally transmitted Zika case on Saturday, after a 47-year-old Malaysian woman tested positive. Just one day later, the government reported that 41 Zika cases had been confirmed.Opposition politicians, pointing to that sudden increase, questioned whether the government had been upfront with the public about the spread of Zika here. The Workers\u2019 Party, the only elected opposition party with representatives in Singapore\u2019s Parliament, called on Sunday for the government to clarify its timeline for public notification of such cases, and the Singapore Democratic Party said on its website that officials must \u201cstop giving excuses and give Singaporeans timely and complete information.\u201dOn Sunday, Chee Hong Tat, the minister for both health and information, denied that there had been any attempt to conceal the outbreak. \u201cThis is certainly not true,\u201d he wrote on Facebook, adding that the government had been \u201cproactive in engaging the different stakeholders to identify possible cases, conducting screening and testing to identify the confirmed cases, and promptly announcing such cases to the public once they have been confirmed.\u201dLast year, an outbreak of hepatitis C that affected 25 patients at Singapore General Hospital was not made public for months, raising questions about the government\u2019s transparency in reporting threats to public health. Eight of the people had died, though the local news media attributed only seven of the deaths to the virus.The Zika outbreak has also stirred painful memories here of the 2003 epidemic of sudden acute respiratory syndrome, SARS, , which led to 33 deaths in Singapore.\u201cI really hope this Zika hoo-ha is contained soon,\u201d said Low Chee Beng, 38, a self-employed Singaporean. \u201cI don\u2019t want to return to the SARS days when we had to worry about even leaving our home.\u201dAn earlier version of a capsule summary with this article misstated the day on which the government confirmed 82 Zika cases in Singapore.

{"Headline": "Kashmiri Faces Sedition Charges Over Facebook Activity", "Date": "2016-08-05", "News": "Supported byNEW DELHI \u2014 The police in central India have charged a man with sedition, a colonial-era offense that can result in life imprisonment, based on Facebook content he shared or posted calling for India to withdraw from the Himalayan region of Kashmir.The man, Tauseef Ahmad Bhat, 29, a Kashmiri engineer working at a mobile phone company in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh, was arrested on Wednesday, accused of \u201cliking, sharing and posting anti-India content on Facebook,\u201d said Amresh Mishra, superintendent of the police in the district where the arrest occurred.A formal complaint brought by the police said a post on Mr. Bhat\u2019s Facebook page had called for India to withdraw from Kashmir, which is divided between India and Pakistan, and had shown the flags of China and Pakistan flying in the background, as well as masked men holding black flags.Another post, the complaint said, displayed a caricature of a hand with a broom, shooing away a mouse rendered in the colors of the Indian flag, with the caption, \u201cGet out from Kashmir.\u201d The complaint also said that Mr. Bhat had posted material critical of Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India.Mr. Mishra, who oversaw the arrest on Wednesday after bringing the complaint on Tuesday night, said that the charges were based solely on Mr. Bhat\u2019s Facebook posts and that Mr. Bhat \u201cwas not found to be involved in any other activity.\u201d He said that \u201ccertain members of civil society\u201d had identified the Facebook posts and reported them to the police.\u201cThese things are and may be normal in Kashmir, but not in this part of the country,\u201d he said.Mr. Bhat could not be reached for comment.Mr. Mishra said that Mr. Bhat, who has a master\u2019s degree in engineering, was apprehended on a train headed for the city of Jammu, in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. He said that the train was stopped after it crossed into a neighboring state and that Mr. Bhat was brought back to Chhattisgarh.The arrest was prompted by activists from a right-wing Hindu group, the Bajrang Dal. They were scouring social media on Tuesday evening, looking for content harmful to India\u2019s image, when they came across Mr. Bhat\u2019s posts, according to Ratan Yadav, 42, coordinator of the organization in the area.\u201cI immediately instructed my local workers, the young lovers of Hinduism, to do one thing: take screenshots,\u201d Mr. Yadav said. \u201cMr. Bhat has abused the army, the police and India in the posts that he has liked and shared.\u201d\u201cHe has been abusive of the thing\u201d that matters most, Mr. Yadav said, \u201cBharat Mata, or Mother India.\u201dMr. Mishra said that the activists \u201chave a right to protest\u201d and that he filed the complaint against Mr. Bhat on Tuesday night.The law against sedition, which the British colonial administration introduced in India, can be used against anyone who \u201cbrings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite dissatisfaction towards, the government established by law.\u201dThe Constitution protects freedom of speech and expression but with exceptions, among them speech that undermines \u201cthe sovereignty and integrity of India.\u201d Governments in the country have broadly used sedition charges, often for political gain. In 2012, a cartoonist was charged with sedition for posting a satirical drawing on a website. In 2015, the Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional one statute used against him, section 66a of the IT Act, which made it a criminal act to post offensive material using the internet.Sedition, however, remains on the books in India, as it does \u201cacross post-colonial Asia,\u201d said Karuna Nundy, a Supreme Court lawyer who argued and won the case striking down section 66a. \u201cThey are batons that independent governments in India, Pakistan, Malaysia, Singapore and many other countries decided to keep.\u201dShe added that the reasoning used to strike down section 66a, which distinguished advocacy from incitement and warned against the \u201cchilling effect\u201d of an overbroad law, applies equally to sedition.Mr. Yadav, the Hindu activist, said that Mr. Bhat, whom he does not know but has tracked on Facebook, \u201cformed a group of Kashmiris and, while living on Indian soil, he is talking of dividing India.\u201d\u201cAnti-India activities have gone up on social media of late, and Kashmiris are using it to the hilt to further an anti-India agenda,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are keeping watch.\u201dHe added that his organization had mobilized to \u201csave cows from the Muslims and whoever else might be smuggling or slaughtering them\u201d and that it had ensured \u201cthe culprits are punished.\u201dSuhasini Raj reported from New Delhi, and Ellen Barry from Bangalore, India.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "FOIA, Subpoenas and Singapore\u2019s Libel Laws: All in a Day\u2019s Work", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s 5 a.m. and the first question on my mind is not \u201cWhat am I doing up?\u201d but \u201cWhat are we saying today about Singapore?\u201d As with most things in life, the answer lies in my iPhone.It\u2019s a daily ritual: checking my email before dawn to see whether I need to do a legal review of any stories heading toward deadline at our newsroom in Hong Kong. Singapore, with its strict libel laws, is always a concern. Among the many things they don\u2019t teach you in law school is how to make keen judgments on matters of foreign law while half-awake, half a world away. Somehow it works out, and especially today: None of our editors in Asia is looking for me.But in my inbox is a message from a reporter in the United States. He\u2019s been told he might be subpoenaed in a high-profile criminal case. At this stage, it\u2019s all just talk; much too soon to worry. For all the attention that big-time subpoenas get, 14 years at The Times has taught me that most of them go away with barely a whimper. Defendants take a plea, litigants settle, lawyers change their minds, or, more often than not, our strategy of throwing up every objection we can think of makes the whole thing more bother than it\u2019s worth.Most people think my day is mainly spent reading stories for legal risks. That\u2019s not so, but it is an important part of the job. And when you work for a digital publisher that updates the web constantly, you end up vetting articles at dinner, on the subway and in the middle of movies. I was once shown on the video scoreboard at Yankee Stadium working on a story on my cellphone.Libel suits are rare \u2014 our only active case was just dismissed by a judge in New Orleans \u2014 but a steady stream of complaint letters find their way to my desk and need to be dealt with. Some are rants, some are detailed and well-researched lawyer letters. And then there is the person who claims to have uncovered a secret code in a Tweet posted by a Times columnist.In recent years, I have spent increasing amounts of time waging legal battles against secrecy, seeking to open court files or get documents for our reporters through the Freedom of Information Act. We sue \u2014 a lot. And we\u2019re pretty much alone. The last time we checked the statistics, The Times had filed 14 federal FOIA suits over a two-year period; our peers in the mainstream media had filed a total of six altogether.Today\u2019s task is to write a brief for a case we have against the C.I.A. Our reporters are seeking the release of three classified documents about the old chemical warheads that were found in Iraq after the fall of Saddam Hussein.It\u2019s a bizarre dance, litigating with the C.I.A. The agency says it can neither confirm nor deny that the documents even exist \u2014 despite our asking for them by name and date. I write my brief as if there is no question that the documents exist; the C.I.A. writes its briefs as if it has no idea what I am talking about.Few in-house lawyers actually litigate cases, but I never wanted to be the stereotypical in-house counsel: a lawyer who calls lawyers. So I take on as many cases as I can. I am probably the only lawyer in New York who has argued cases this year before both the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and the Small Claims Court of the City of New York. (I won at the Second Circuit. As for small claims: Never tangle with an angry Times subscriber who says she didn\u2019t get her paper.)As always, my brief gets written in fits and starts. The emails and the phone calls keep coming. A reporter in Washington wants to know whether we can sue the federal government to get some Guant\u00e1namo documents. (We can, and we do.) An editor in New York is concerned about calling someone a \u201ccrony\u201d in a story. (We can live with that.) Someone else wants me to look at an article that recounts a series of unsuccessful business deals. (All is good.)At that point I started working with our editors and with Tug to improve our system for international security. We\u2019ve gotten pretty good at it. But the challenges are constant \u2014 whether it\u2019s the anti-press fury in Turkey, the deteriorating safety conditions in Afghanistan or a possible relocation of our Baghdad bureau.The day rolls on, a mosaic of moving and disjointed pieces: meeting with our marketing department to discuss state consumer protection laws, editing an article I\u2019m writing for a libel conference, reviewing an insurance policy, dealing with an endless dispute over a distribution contract, answering a question about using Facebook photos in the paper. Then there is the sit-down with reporters who are frustrated with a new round of stonewalling by officials in Albany. (Yes, some things about my job have not changed in 14 years.)By day\u2019s end, I realize I have managed to get only one real break from work \u2014 for a dental appointment. When I get there, the dentist takes me aside. He wants to know what reporters are saying about Trump behind the scenes. So much for escaping The Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Creepy Clown Sightings in South Carolina Cause a Frenzy", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "Supported byAt the edge of dark, dark woods in South Carolina, children have been telling adults that a group of clowns have been trying to lure them into the cluster of trees. They say the clowns live deep in the woods, near a house by a pond.This tale sounds like a mishmash of newspaper clippings and pages ripped from Stephen King novels, but these are actually details taken from a report filed by the sheriff\u2019s office in Greenville County, S.C., last week, after several residents at an apartment complex there said that people in clown makeup had been terrorizing both children and adults.Several children said that clowns were offering them money to follow them into the woods, close to the house by the pond. (The police say they have found no evidence of clown paraphernalia at the house.)A woman walking home late one night said she had seen a \u201clarge-figured\u201d clown waving at her from under a streetlight, the police said. (She waved back.) And another woman said her son had heard clanging chains and a banging noise at his front door. In these cases, people who reported clown sightings refused to give their names to the police.The police don\u2019t know whether the stories are coming from the imaginations of children or something sinister is afoot, but panicked residents seemed to be taking the law into their own hands: The Greenville sheriff\u2019s office investigated reports that residents of the apartment complex may have fired shots in the direction of the wooded area.And the calls to the police continue: On Monday, a child at a different complex phoned the police to report another clown sighting.The pranksters, viral marketers and criminals may be taking advantage of a cultural fear of clowns, with examples including Mr. King\u2019s \u201cIt,\u201d and John Wayne Gacy, a serial killer who dressed as a clown. But Steven Schlozman, a child psychiatrist who teaches a course on the psychology of horror films at Harvard University, suggests that something more primal could be at work.Humans are built to recognize patterns from an early age, and a clown\u2019s exaggerated human features set off a primal warning bell from within our \u201ccrocodile brains,\u201d Dr. Schlozman said in an interview on Tuesday.\u201cIt has this kind of capacity to grab you emotionally before it grabs you cognitively,\u201d Dr. Schlozman said. \u201cThat\u2019s the key to making something viral online actually: to make people emotionally engaged before they\u2019re intellectually engaged.\u201dIn his years researching the things that scare us, Dr. Schlozman has also uncovered another truism: Horror is almost never about the thing that\u2019s scary. The horror unravels once terrified people respond.When the locals take their guns out and fire into the woods, it\u2019s not that different from people going with their pitchforks into the woods after Frankenstein\u2019s monster, he said, adding: \u201cIt never ends well.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We were together from the first thing in the morning to the club at night, on and off, for a month.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It helped that Mr. Grace knew something about what it was like to get on stage and try to make people laugh. In the late 1960s, he had tried his hand at stand-up at a friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coffeehouse in Cape Cod. For a week, he took his lumps in front of a live audience. It was a learning experience, he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI realized that to be funny on a nightly basis, you have to be a professional.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He relinquished any hope of becoming a comedian, but not his interest in the men and women who worked the trade, some of whom \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including Mr. Williams \u00e2\u0080\u0093 appeared in his 1991 photo book, \u00e2\u0080\u009cComedians.\u00e2\u0080\u009d From the first assignment in 1986, their friendship flourished, Mr. Grace said. Mr. Williams was interested in the photographer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trade and his life, and peppered him with questions about what it was like to photograph Ronald Reagan or about the Cold War. He asked about photographing in East Germany under the eye of the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surveillance apparatus.They went on family vacations together. Mr. Williams insisted on taking Mr. Grace snowboarding (a failure) and throwing Mr. Grace a party to celebrate the photographer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wedding (a happy success). When Mr. Grace took pictures, it was often at Mr. Williams\u00e2\u0080\u0099s request, not to fulfill an assignment. It was the kind of access that photographers dream about. Still, Mr. Grace said he never saw the emotional distress that led to Mr. Williams\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suicide in 2014, or the effects of the diffuse Lewy body dementia underlying that distress. In a 2015 interview with People magazine, Mr. Williams\u00e2\u0080\u0099s widow, Susan Schneider Williams, was quoted as saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was not depression that killed Robin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She added that \u00e2\u0080\u009cdepression was one of, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call it 50 symptoms, and it was a small one.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAfter hearing of his friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death, Mr. Grace holed up for six or seven months, avoiding requests from magazines that were seeking his photographs of Mr. Williams. Finally, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI felt an obligation to his fans that loved him, who respected him. Because I was in a unique position \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d had unlimited access for three decades. What are you going to do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Grace assembled a makeshift office and began sorting through thousands of photographs, including shots he had taken for Mr. Williams\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Christmas cards or during private family outings. The result is his new book, \u00e2\u0080\u009cRobin Williams: A Singular Portrait 1986-2002,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and most of the images are appearing in print for the first time. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are certain people who have a face that the camera loves,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Grace said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRonald Reagan looked great all the time. You couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take a bad picture of Reagan. Robin always looked great. The camera liked him. But not like a fashion model. And he was always cooperative unless he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like you.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHis aim with the book, from which the images here are taken, was to convey \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe whole picture of what he was like,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Grace said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWas he depressed? I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know. I know when something was bothering him, something hurt him. He felt it and got angry just like anybody else.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo one knew about the Lewy body dementia. The last time I saw him in 2013 or 2014, he was the same old Robin. He came to my house for dinner. He just wanted to be peaceful because the demands on him were hard, and he was over 60 now. He needed more time to be quiet and reflect. But he would switch from that, and the next second he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be riffing about my dog, and it was so funny you couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t eat your food.\u00e2\u0080\u009d "}

{"Headline": "Debate in New Jersey: Is Bear That Walks Upright Suffering, or Thriving?", "Date": "2016-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOAK RIDGE, N.J. \u2014 The first time Greg Macgowan\u2019s wife saw the bear near their home, the upper half of the animal\u2019s body was obscured by a neighbor\u2019s deck. \u201cShe said, \u2018Come here \u2014 there\u2019s a guy in a bear suit,\u2019\u201d he recalled.It turned out to be a real bear, but one that differed from the typical backyard visitor searching for food or wishing to cool off in a pool. This one walked almost entirely upright.With two maimed front legs, Pedals, an American black bear who displays remarkably good posture, manages to get around on his hind legs. His unusual condition has spawned coveted sightings and viral videos. \u201cPedals is my spirit animal,\u201d one person wrote on Facebook.But the wandering bear has also inspired a fierce debate, between those who would put him in a wildlife sanctuary and those who would leave him be.The fascination with the bipedal bear comes as New Jersey grapples with a large bear population, which has grown steadily since the 1980s. There are now an estimated 2,500 bears north of Interstate 80, and the state introduced a hunting season several years ago to manage the ursine population.While most bears roaming through the area are met with fear, or even indifference, the bipedal bear has provoked the opposite reaction, with both local residents and a worldwide internet audience becoming passionate, protective and, most of all, opinionated.Supporters also raised more than $25,000 to help pay for a new enclosure there. They commiserated on the Facebook page \u201cPedals the Injured Bipedal Bear.\u201d A typical plea came this summer from Angie Mason, of North Yorkshire, in England: \u201cI feel sick every time I see a picture,\u201d she said. \u201cHe must be in agony. How would we feel walking on all fours for 3 years?\u201dOthers feel just as strongly that humans should keep their hands off. According to state wildlife biologists, the bear is doing fine on his own; they estimated his weight at 300 to 350 pounds, though they do not know his age. They believe the bear is a male based on his size and images captured on video.\u201cDivision biologists note that, based on the video, the bear is active, appears healthy, a little larger than last year, and is thriving on its own having adapted to its condition,\u201d the post said.\u201cThe bear was able to find adequate food resources in an area of high bear density and to have successfully denned through at least the past two winters in its current condition,\u201d the post said. \u201cTherefore, there is no need for intervention at this time.\u201dIt is unclear how the bear was injured. A former state wildlife biologist speculated in 2014, when the bear was first spotted, that it was hit by a car. But the bear may also have a congenital defect; in various videos, the right front leg appears truncated, while the left paw dangles.\u201cOther than the videos, we haven\u2019t been able to get a close look at him,\u201d said Larry Hajna, a spokesman for the state Department of Environmental Protection, adding that biologists did not see a need to perform an examination of the bear.In an interview posted on YouTube last month, Tracy Leaver, the founder and executive director of Woodlands Wildlife Refuge in Alexandria Township, N.J., said the desire to help the bear was understandable, but misguided. She explained that he had clearly managed to find food and a den during successive winters, despite his limited mobility.\u201cThat\u2019s what wildlife does,\u201d she said. \u201cThey survive. He\u2019s over it. We\u2019re not, as people. We want to reach in, we want to help, we want to fix him.\u201d\u201cLife is wonderful for this animal right now,\u201d she added. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of natural food. To take that bear out of that beautiful home range that he\u2019s been living successfully in, and put him in an enclosure anywhere, would be like imprisoning him.\u201dLisa Ragoobir, who lives here in Oak Ridge, was encouraged that the bear seemed to have put on weight. \u201cThis year he looks much healthier,\u201d she said from her deck overlooking a meadow of cattails and milkweed, where the bear was seen strutting in June. \u201cThe first time I saw him, he was so skinny.\u201dBears are frequent visitors to her property, she said. Recently, a sow with three cubs lingered in the vegetation about 100 feet from Mrs. Ragoobir\u2019s back deck. She and her family take precautions, she said, just like everyone else in this corner of New Jersey, where bears are as common as wild turkey and deer are elsewhere.Her children know, for example, to move to the elevated deck from the yard, especially when cubs are present. \u201cI\u2019m afraid of snakes more than the bears,\u201d she said.\u201cHe\u2019s doing fine in the wild,\u201d Mr. Macgowan said. \u201cHe just does it on two legs. I think nature is best left where it is.\u201dState officials, in the meantime, say that Pedals has helped put wildlife in New Jersey on the world map \u2014 a nice change of pace for a state known to carry a chip on its shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s very compelling,\u201d Mr. Hajna said. \u201cThis is a very resilient bear. He\u2019s really captured the attention and hearts of a lot of people.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Leftover Meal Plan Swipes: No Waste Here", "Date": "2016-08-05", "News": "Supported byRoom and BoardTo Asia Suarez, a computer science major, the math hit like an error message: With less than three weeks left in the spring term, she would need to eat seven meals a day to use up the remaining 131 swipes on her food plan at New York University. A soccer player who works out furiously and eats \u201ca lot,\u201d Ms. Suarez still found that 300 meals a semester (for $2,541) were too many.So she shared. One evening, Ms. Suarez swiped in four guests at Hayden, a dining hall famous for its homemade cookies. The hungry guests came via Share Meals, a campus website matching students needing food with those who have food. The 80-meal plan in Adam El-Sayigh\u2019s financial aid package had run out weeks before. He didn\u2019t have money for more. Happily, he hit the hot food stations first, filling a to-go container with two cheese sandwiches on toasted wheat and a tray with roast beef, chicken cacciatore and bow-tie pasta with vodka sauce. He then ordered a burger.Students have always offered one another casual swipes, and even sold them. (Advertised on Facebook: 50 swipes at Western Carolina University for $50; \u201cwilling to swipe in for $5\u201d at the University of California, Davis.) But frugality born of college debt and growing attention to food insecurity \u2014 a U.S.D.A. term for limited access to food \u2014 are spurring new thinking about how to spread the bounty. Activists in the food justice movement and college officials are creating tools and programs to help students donate meal swipes, while free food pantries are proliferating even on wealthy campuses.Some of the disparity is driven by dining policies. Many colleges require dorm residents to buy meal plans. But it\u2019s hard to predict at the start of the term what you\u2019ll use. Busy schedules and the desire to eat out mean missed dining hall meals. And the rules smart: Swipes may expire at the end of the term, or even each week. You might have to pull out cash for certain items, like a side of fries. But perhaps the biggest frustration is the wasted money that unused swipes represent.Anagha Uppal, an activist at the University of Tennessee, describes the meal plan rule as \u201can exercise in tyranny.\u201d Ms. Uppal has not used her plan \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t purchase from Aramark,\u201d she said between bites of chicken salad in pita (cost: $5.74) at the Golden Roast Coffeehouse. On her laptop: a Food Recovery Network sticker; she\u2019s a campus coordinator for the network, a national student group that fights food waste. It was Ms. Uppal who prodded officials to start the Big Orange Meal Share to let students donate swipes.Ms. Uppal sees student hunger, mandatory meal plans and higher prices as interconnected points in the food justice movement. Across the spectrum, dining hall spending is getting a hard look. Over the past decade, average board (20 meals a week) at four-year colleges has risen 46 percent, to $4,602 for 2014-15, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. To some, meal plans, at $7 to $13 a swipe, look like luxury spending that is driving up the cost of a degree.New Jersey legislators are proposing a bill to bar colleges from requiring students to buy meal plans. \u201cIf you thought about financing your food on a credit card or 8 percent loan, that is a significant cost,\u201d said Assemblywoman Nancy J. Pinkin, a bill sponsor.One reason for pricey meals is more and better choices, said Becky Schilling, editor in chief of Food Management, which covers the institutional dining industry. Students want global cuisine, breakfast at midnight and organic food from sustainable sources. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Where are you getting these products? How were these animals raised? Was it cage-free?\u2019\u2009\u201d Swipes may buy all-you-can-eat buffets, sandwiches and drinks at a food court, or \u201cmeal equivalency\u201d at a restaurant. \u201cDining dollars\u201d can work at Starbucks, campus stores, even food trucks. N.Y.U. has 11 meal plan options.At the same time, Ms. Schilling said, \u201cthis issue of hunger has percolated, and students are being vocal: \u2018We are paying a lot for the college experience and we are having trouble paying for this.\u2019\u201dThe scope of food insecurity is tricky to judge because research is scant, definitions are imprecise and campuses vary so much. A 2010 City University of New York survey found that 40 percent of students struggled to find food. On California State campuses, 24 percent faced food insecurity, according to a 2015 study, while just 13 percent went hungry at the University of California, San Francisco.Students on tight budgets are known to skip meals or reduce or quit dining plans to save money. Some on full financial aid get meals covered, then take smaller plans to pocket the difference in cash.One of the challenges is grasping the true contours of the problem. \u201cHow can we better understand which are the students who are making sacrifices versus the ones who are choosing ramen because they would rather save money for Thursday night?\u201d Ms. Sumekh asked.To prevent abuse, some campuses limit how many meals can be donated or claimed by the student body. At N.Y.U., Ann Marie Powell, director of Contract Dining Services, takes a more permissive stance and even lets Mr. Chin set up booths at dining halls. \u201cStudents\u2019 meal plans are theirs to use or share,\u201d she said. This fall, N.Y.U. will allow up to six emergency food vouchers a semester.Mr. Chin started Share Meals to tackle \u201chunger and loneliness.\u201d He encourages donors and recipients to sit down and talk. Ms. Suarez ate several times with a couple receiving her swipes, and she has ordered takeout so often for Mr. El-Sayigh that she has nicknamed him Curly Fries. \u201cHe messages me whenever,\u201d she said. She places the order; he picks it up.Alexa Osterhoudt, a biology major, is grateful for Share Meals. Since her mother lost her job, she moved off campus, eliminated her meal plan and doesn\u2019t buy textbooks or class supplies. Her food budget is $7.50 a week. She said she\u2019s \u201cmade friends with a lot of people who work at groceries and restaurants,\u201d spending time and emotional energy searching for food. One student started swiping her in every Thursday. Her dining hall preference? \u201cAnything with a buffet.\u201dLaura Pappano is writer-in-residence at Wellesley Centers for Women.Advertisement"}

People had taken still-unexplained sounds for gunshots, screamed, dived into stores and made a chaotic rush for the exits, paying little heed to what was in their way \u2014 including the Patels.The crowd knocked the couple down and trampled Ms. Patel, breaking her right femur and leaving her to wait in searing pain for two hours until police officers in tactical gear arrived and helped carry her out of the mall on a plastic display table. Surgeons braced her shattered leg with a steel rod, plate and screws, but the pain is still intense. Ms. Patel, who usually travels to India for three months each year with her husband, remains homebound.Mr. Patel said he could see fear on the faces of the people who rushed over him and his wife.\u201cThey thought that somebody\u2019s there to kill them,\u201d he said. \u201cPsychologically, we have been damaged.\u201dSocial media feeds that kind of frenzy, said Roxane Cohen Silver, a professor of psychology and social behavior at the University of California, Irvine.\u201cThere\u2019s rapid dissemination of information on social media that\u2019s not being filtered by anybody,\u201d she said. \u201cThis provides the unfortunate opportunity for rumors to be transmitted very quickly, without any ability to evaluate the veracity.\u201dBefore there were television news reports about what was happening at the Los Angeles airport, she said, her son in Chicago had called to tell her, \u201cI\u2019m watching Twitter videos of people running at LAX.\u201dAt the Florida Mall in Orlando, popping balloons were apparently mistaken for gunshots. At the Twelve Oaks Mall in Novi, Mich., it was a glass door toppling to the floor, knocked over by thieves who had smashed a glass display case in a jewelry store to grab two luxury watches.As the robbers ran, so did shoppers, and people posted videos of the chaotic scene on social media and said \u2014 falsely \u2014 that shots had been fired. That message spread fast, and calls to the Novi police overwhelmed the 911 system, shunting overflow callers to the state police.\u201cIt\u2019s a wildfire you try to control,\u201d said Detective Sgt. Scott Baetens of the Novi Police Department. \u201cWe try to put out timely and accurate information. But you can\u2019t put it out fast enough to beat Twitter and Facebook.\u201dOnce people start to flee, it is fairly normal for others to join in, experts say \u2014 even people who did not hear any suspicious sounds or rumors of terrorism. But people who study crowd psychology and the fear of terrorism say the steady stream of news reports of bloodshed has heightened anxieties out of proportion to the threat, making panic more likely to take hold.\u201cThis overexposure can cause increased fear, anxiety and helplessness, particularly in already psychologically vulnerable populations,\u201d said Daniel Antonius, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University at Buffalo. He described \u201ca national anxiety\u201d about mass attacks that did not reflect the real level of danger.Dr. Horgan stressed that in addition to physical violence, \u201cterrorism is fundamentally a form of psychological warfare, and it\u2019s one of the greatest ironies that we help give it its strength in our reactions to it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Ngozi is the church girl who works for a nongovernmental organization and purses her lips at too much talk about the male anatomy. And Sade is Samantha, with condoms spilling from the designer handbags that her rich, married boyfriend buys for her. The women spend an enormous amount of time sipping cocktails in dimly lit restaurants as they chat about rolling power outages, good condom etiquette and men who expect them to leave their jobs and make fufu all day.The five women are all \u201creturnees,\u201d the children of families who left Ghana for the West and then came home with so-called \u201creturnee savior syndrome.\u201d The phrase \u201cto whom much is given, much is required\u201d could be their unofficial motto, as it frames their interactions and challenges their way of thinking. They are constantly fretting about whether they would tip so little if back in Manhattan, or why the \u201cwhite wedding\u201d is considered better than a traditional one.The show has received deserved criticism for the distance it maintains from the side of Ghana that doesn\u2019t yet have street signs or personal chauffeurs. Some of the women\u2019s biggest problems are the usual complaints of the well off. Are their maids stealing their bras? Shouldn\u2019t their neighbors buy expensive silencers for their power generators so the women can sleep a bit more peacefully at night? This is Ghana\u2019s 1 percent, portraying a lifestyle that few on the continent can relate to.Just like the original, \u201cSex and the City.\u201dBut the show\u2019s appeal comes from the ability to turn the same discussions that women around the world are having over cocktails and in group texts into a salient critique of Western and African cultures.Bringing a handsome lawyer from Washington home to meet the traditional West African family reveals the divide between black people in Africa and black people from the United States. The question of entitlement is explored through familial connections high up in government. And a conversation about a particular form of birth control earns a quick and snappy referendum on colonialism, as Zainab says, \u201cThe only time you will hear me support the pullout method is happily discussing the British pulling out of Ghana in 1975.\u201dIn an interview, Ms. Amarteifio said most of her audience outside of Africa is in the United States, followed by Britain, France and Canada.

After Zainab\u2019s date assures her that he is not married or seeing anyone, he friends her on Facebook without bothering to hide his actual marital status. \u201cWhen a man in Ghana says that he\u2019s single, it means that his wife is just in another country or in another city or the other room,\u201d Sade tells her.In Season 2, Makena\u2019s African-American boyfriend is upset to learn that her family\u2019s houseboy calls her uncle \u201cmaster,\u201d and she herself goes into personal crisis when her aunt tells her that the family once owned slaves.

{"Headline": "Breitbart Rises From Outlier to Potent Voice in Campaign", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "Supported byBreitbart News has arrived.Known for gleefully bashing the old Republican establishment, Breitbart now finds itself at the center of the party\u2019s presidential campaign. Its longtime chairman, Stephen K. Bannon, was named campaign chief by Mr. Trump, whose nationalist, conspiracy-minded message routinely mirrors the Breitbart worldview.On Facebook, it rivals news organizations like The Washington Post and Yahoo, and it has challenged conservative favorites like Fox News in its influence on the campaign, if not in size of audience.For Mrs. Clinton, it was a strategic attack that linked Mr. Trump to leading avatars of the hard-line right. But among Breitbart\u2019s ideologically driven journalists, her remarks were taken as validation.\u201cI\u2019ll play it cool, but not that cool: It was a big moment,\u201d the site\u2019s editor in chief, Alexander Marlow, 30, said in an interview on Friday. \u201cA major presidential candidate engaging us like that, and calling us out directly, was quite thrilling.\u201dThe rise of Breitbart News, founded a decade ago by the provocateur Andrew Breitbart, who died in 2012, is an unlikely outcome for a small, decentralized news outlet with a penchant for infighting. But it remains an outsize source of controversy \u2014 for liberals and even many traditional conservatives \u2014 over material that has been called misogynist, xenophobic and racist.The site refers to \u201cmigrant rape gangs\u201d in Europe, and was among the first news outlets to disseminate unsubstantiated rumors that Mrs. Clinton was in ill health. Its writers often vilify the Black Lives Matter movement, emphasizing what they call a scourge of \u201cblack-on-black crime,\u201d and described \u201cyoung Muslims in the West\u201d as the world\u2019s \u201cticking time bomb.\u201dBefore Mr. Breitbart died, the site had gained notoriety by championing the Tea Party movement and publicizing an undercover video that led to the closing of Acorn, the community organizing group. It also posted misleading footage of Shirley Sherrod, a black Department of Agriculture official, who was fired for seeming to express resentment toward a white farmer; the White House later apologized.Last month, Milo Yiannopoulos, the site\u2019s tech editor, was banned from Twitter after inspiring a sustained online harassment campaign against the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d actor Leslie Jones. Reports surfaced this week about domestic violence charges filed against Mr. Bannon stemming from a divorce in 1996.Supporters say it is the site\u2019s willingness to embrace viewpoints considered far outside the bounds of respectable political discourse that is the very source of its success \u2014 in the same way that Mr. Trump\u2019s more extreme proposals, like banning Muslims from entering the country, galvanized the Republican primary electorate.And like Mr. Trump, Breitbart excels on social media. Last month, it ranked as the 11th most popular site on Facebook, according to statistics from the social analytics firm NewsWhip. A year ago, its Facebook page had fewer than a million followers; now, it has more than 2.3 million.Breitbart, which is privately owned, has declined to release revenue figures. The site appears to be backed by Mr. Breitbart\u2019s estate; its chief executive, Larry Solov; and the family of Robert Mercer, a wealthy conservative donor and Trump supporter, according to corporate documents and two people briefed on the company\u2019s finances.For Mr. Marlow, the editor in chief, the site\u2019s success comes from attracting an underserved segment of conservatives \u2014 opponents of immigration and free trade who did not see their views reflected in other outlets.In online conservative news media, Mr. Marlow said, \u201cThe focus has not been on the traditional left-versus-right dichotomy. It\u2019s become populism and nationalism versus globalism.\u201dHe said that Fox News, long a favored venue for the Republican establishment, had lost its feel for the grass-roots right, saying the network harps on older controversies, like the attack on the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, and that its owner, Rupert Murdoch, is unwilling to criticize open immigration.10 Photos\u201cFox is critical of Trump and a lot of the values that his voters stand for,\u201d Mr. Marlow said. \u201cA lot of conservatives feel betrayed.\u201d (Fox News has drawn its highest-ever ratings amid this year\u2019s campaign, and Mr. Trump routinely appears on the network. \u201cWe will let our record-breaking year speak for itself,\u201d the network said in a statement on Friday.)For those who track hate groups, Breitbart\u2019s success is particularly alarming.\u201cBreitbart in the last year or so has consistently picked up themes coming from the alt-right,\u201d said Heidi Beirich, the director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center, using a nickname for a loosely affiliated online movement that includes hard-line nationalists and many supporters of Mr. Trump.Ms. Beirich said that Breitbart came to her attention because she found that white supremacist websites, like The Daily Stormer, were increasingly linking to its coverage. \u201cTo people in the alt-right, who have basically been maligned and haven\u2019t been part of the political system at all, this is a big, big deal,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cTheir views are finally in the mainstream.\u201dIt was this development that prompted aides to Mrs. Clinton to consider whether she should explicitly call out Breitbart to voters.\u201cWe think it\u2019s important that people understand what Trump stands for, and what these groups stand for, and what it means that he echoes them,\u201d said Glen Caplin, a Clinton campaign spokesman.Not everyone affiliated with Breitbart is pleased with the site\u2019s recent turn. Several longtime staff members quit earlier this year, saying that Mr. Bannon had turned a website founded on anti-authoritarian grounds into a de facto propaganda outlet for Mr. Trump.\u201cI don\u2019t think it would be Andrew Breitbart\u2019s proudest moment to be called the foundation for white supremacy on the internet,\u201d Ben Shapiro, one of the editors who resigned, said on Friday.Did Mr. Shapiro ever expect to see Breitbart, which began as a no-frills aggregator of wire stories, prominently featured in a speech by a major-party presidential candidate?\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have surprised me if a Democratic presidential candidate did that,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cI\u2019m just surprised that she\u2019s not wrong.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Many Guns Did the U.S. Lose Track of in Iraq and Afghanistan? Hundreds of Thousands.", "Date": "2016-08-24", "News": "Supported byNotebookEarly this year, a Facebook user in Baghdad using the name Hussein Mahyawi posted a photograph of a slightly worn M4 assault rifle he was offering for sale. Veterans of the latest war in Iraq immediately recognized it. It was a standard American carbine equipped with a holographic sight, a foregrip that was military-issue during the occupation and a sticker bearing a digital QR code used by American forces for inventory control. Except for one detail \u2014 an aftermarket pistol grip, the sort of accessory with which combatants of the current generation often pimp their guns \u2014 it was a dead ringer for any of the tens of thousands of M4s the Pentagon handed out to Iraqi security forces and various armed militias after toppling Saddam Hussein in 2003. And here it was on the open market, ready for bids.Was this a surprise? No. A little more than four years after the United States withdrew all its military forces from Iraq, and not quite two years after a smaller number of American troops began returning to the country to help fight the Islamic State, the open sale of such an M4 was part of Iraq\u2019s day-to-day arms-trafficking routine. Mahyawi\u2019s carbine was another data point attesting to an extraordinary and dangerous failure of American arms-trafficking and public accountability and to a departure from a modern military\u2019s most basic practice: keeping track of the guns.Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the United States has handed out a vast but persistently uncountable quantity of military firearms to its many battlefield partners in Afghanistan and Iraq. Today the Pentagon has only a partial idea of how many weapons it issued, much less where these weapons are. Meanwhile, the effectively bottomless abundance of black-market weapons from American sources is one reason Iraq will not recover from its post-invasion woes anytime soon.An inkling of just how expansive these arms transfers were, and how stubbornly resistant they are to precise measurement, is apparent in a new attempt at weapons-tallying compiled in a project led by Iain Overton. Overton is a former BBC journalist who is now the executive director of Action on Armed Violence, a charity based in London that researches and lobbies against weapons proliferation and violence against civilians; he is also the author of \u201cThe Way of the Gun,\u201d a dark examination of some of the roles firearms play in modern society. With a string of Freedom of Information Act requests that began last year, he and his small team of researchers pooled 14 years\u2019 worth of Pentagon contract information related to rifles, pistols, machine guns and their associated attachments and ammunition, both for American troops and for their partners and proxies. They then crosschecked the data against other public records. Overton is releasing the data and his analysis today. It covers 412 contracts and merits pause for reflection as the parties to the international Arms Trade Treaty gather this week in Geneva. The treaty, which took effect in 2014 and of which the United States is a signatory, is intended to promote transparency and responsible action in the transfer of conventional arms and to reduce their diversion to unintended hands \u2014 exactly what the United States often failed to do in recent wars.In all, Overton found, the Pentagon provided more than 1.45 million firearms to various security forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, including more than 978,000 assault rifles, 266,000 pistols and almost 112,000 machine guns. These transfers formed a collage of firearms of mixed vintage and type: Kalashnikov assault rifles left over from the Cold War; recently manufactured NATO-standard M16s and M4s from American factories; machine guns of Russian and Western lineage; and sniper rifles, shotguns and pistols of varied provenance and caliber, including a large order of Glock semiautomatic pistols, a type of weapon also regularly offered for sale online in Iraq.Many of the recipients of these weapons became brave and important battlefield allies. But many more did not. Taken together, the weapons were part of a vast and sometimes minimally supervised flow of arms from a superpower to armies and militias often compromised by poor training, desertion, corruption and patterns of human rights abuses. Knowing what we know about many of these forces, it would have been remarkable for them to retain custody of many of their weapons. It is not surprising that they did not.As an illustration of how haphazard the supervision of this arms distribution often was, last week, five months after being asked by The New York Times for its own tally of small arms issued to partner forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Pentagon said it has records for fewer than half the number of firearms in the researchers\u2019 count \u2014 about 700,000 in all. This is an amount, Overton noted, that \u201conly accounts for 48 percent of the total small arms supplied by the U.S. government that can be found in open-source government reports.\u201dThis gap between the tallies, the Pentagon said, is partly because at first the United States military was trying to stand up to two governments that were busily fighting wars. \u201cSpeed was essential in getting those nations\u2019 security forces armed, equipped and trained to meet these extreme challenges,\u201d Mark Wright, a Pentagon spokesman, wrote in an email. \u201cAs a result, lapses in accountability of some of the weapons transferred occurred.\u201d Wright also said that the Pentagon\u2019s current practices have improved, and that to ensure \u201cthat equipment is only used for authorized purposes,\u201d its representatives \u201cinventory each weapon as it arrives in country and record the distribution of the weapon to the foreign partner nation.\u201dWhy counting weapons, and making a record of serial numbers and recipients, was seen as so time-consuming that it would have slowed down war is not clear. Anyone who has served in a military unit knows that documenting who received what weapon is both a fundamental task and a habit that fits easily into a routine. It takes no more time than issuing a uniform to a soldier or feeding him a meal. But often the Pentagon did not require these steps \u2014 although Wright noted that once a weapon is provided to another force, \u201cIt is their responsibility to account for that weapon.\u201dThe weapons sent from Europe to Iraq, and the crates of ammunition necessary to keep them fed, filled cargo planes \u2014 though Marsh said the available data also does not say how many were directly paid for by the United States, as opposed to those bought by Iraqi ministries with American-donated funds or those donated by countries unloading old stock. This is an important observation, because the latter two categories \u2013 state-to-state gifts via American handlers or otherwise and firearms purchased directly by Afghanistan or Iraq \u2014 might not be in Overton\u2019s final count. This is one of many reasons to suspect that the 1.45 million tally might understate the real quantity of weapons disbursements during a long run of years when the Pentagon played the role in Afghanistan and Iraq of small-arms provider. \u201cIt could be twice as much, as far as we know,\u201d Overton said last Friday, not entirely in jest.Overton\u2019s analysis also does not account for many weapons issued by the American military to local forces by other means, including the reissue of captured weapons, which was a common and largely undocumented practice.Adding to the suspicion that the number is even larger, Overton is certain that his tally missed shipments, because the data that the Defense Department made available was incomplete or laden with contradictions that were not readily reconciled. For example, the contracts it released were for more than $6.5 million or $7 million, depending on the year. Overton suspects that this hides many smaller purchases. And the contract data often labeled purchases vaguely, sometimes making it difficult to determine exactly what was bought, much less for whom. The Pentagon\u2019s data, in short, did not declare much of what the Pentagon actually bought.One point is inarguable: Many of these weapons did not remain long in government possession after arriving in their respective countries. In one of many examples, a 2007 Government Accountability Office report found that 110,000 Kalashnikov assault rifles and 80,000 pistols bought by the United States for Iraq\u2019s security forces could not be accounted for \u2014 more than one firearm for every member of the entire American military force in Iraq at any time during the war. Those documented lapses of accountability were before entire Iraqi divisions simply vanished from the battlefield, as four of them did after the Islamic State seized Mosul and Tikrit in 2014, according to a 2015 Army budget request to buy more firearms for the Iraqi forces to replace what was lost.Certain lines in Overton\u2019s spreadsheets hint at profound tactical shifts. The United States military entered Afghanistan in 2001 with a small contingent of troops, who pushed the Taliban from power by maneuvering with local allies supported by naval and air-to-ground firepower. It invaded Iraq in 2003 with mechanized columns protected by an overpowering rollout of fire support, including airstrikes, cruise missiles, incendiary bombs and cluster submunitions. The combination swiftly routed Iraq\u2019s conventional forces. Then came years of occupation duty and efforts at reconstruction and nation-building across a sprawling geography. Rotations of soldiers and Marines became bogged down in changing missions and faced the familiar threats of guerrilla warfare reborn \u2014 roadside bombs, ambushes and (in Iraq, particularly) snipers.The data show large purchases of heavy-machine guns and barrels. This is a wink at the shift in many American units from being foot-mobile to vehicular, as grunts buttoned up within armored trucks and needed turret-mounted firepower to defend themselves \u2014 a mat\u00e9riel adaptation forced by ambushes and improvised bombs, the cheaply made weapons that wearied the most expensive military in the world.Now look away from the data for a moment to consider what it does not show. The Pentagon provided Overton with contract information on small arms up to a caliber of 30 millimeters. This meant that certain classes of infantry weapons were not included, among them mortars, shoulder-fired rockets and powerful Mark 19 automatic grenade launchers that were mounted on many American vehicles and also used in outpost defense. That omission means the data offer no insight into a startlingly risky aspect of the Pentagon\u2019s arming of local forces with infantry arms: the wide distribution of anti-armor weapons, including RPG-7s, commonly called rocket-propelled grenades, and recoilless weapons, including the SPG-9. Each of these systems fires high-explosive (and often armor-piercing) projectiles, and each was commonly used by insurgents in attacks. After the opening weeks of each war, the only armor on either battlefield was American or associated with allied and local government units, which made the Pentagon\u2019s practice of providing anti-armor weapons to Afghan and Iraqi security forces puzzling. Why would they need anti-armor weapons when they had no armor to fight? All the while rockets were somehow mysteriously being fired at American convoys and patrols in each war.All together, the sheer size of the expenditures, the sustained confusion about totals and the multiple pressures eroding the stock combine to create a portrait of the Pentagon\u2019s bungling the already-awkward role it chose for itself \u2014 that of state-building arms dealer, a role that routinely led to missions in clear opposition to each other. While fighting two rapidly evolving wars, the American military tried to create and bolster new democracies, governments and political classes; recruit, train and equip security and intelligence forces on short schedule and at outsize scale; repair and secure transportation infrastructure; encourage the spread or restoration of the legal industry and public services; and leave behind something more palatable and sturdy than rule by thugs.Any one of these efforts would be difficult on its own. But the United States was trying all these things at once while buying and flying into both countries a prodigious quantity of light military weapons and handing them out to local people and outfits it barely knew. The recipients were often manifestly corrupt and sometimes had close ties to the same militias and insurgents who were trying to drive out the United States and make sure its entire nation-building project did not stand. It should not have been a surprise that American units in disaffected provinces and neighborhoods, and their partners, could encounter gunfire at every turn.The procession of arms purchases and handouts has continued to this day, with others involved, including Iran to its allies in Iraq and various donors to Kurdish fighters. In March, Russia announced that it had given 10,000 Kalashnikov assault rifles to Afghanistan, already one of the most Kalashnikov-saturated places on earth. If an analysis from the United States\u2019 Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, or Sigar, is to be believed, Afghanistan did not even need them. In 2014 the inspector general reported that after the United States decided to replace the Afghan Army\u2019s Kalashnikovs with NATO-standard weapons (a boon for the rifles\u2019 manufacturer with a much less obvious value for an already amply armed Afghan force), the Afghan Army ended up with a surplus of more than 83,000 Kalashnikovs. The United States never tried to recover the excess it had created, giving the inspector general\u2019s office grounds for long-term worry. \u201cWithout confidence in the Afghan government\u2019s ability to account for or properly dispose of these weapons,\u201d it noted, \u201cSigar is concerned that they could be obtained by insurgents and pose additional risks to civilians.\u201dUltimately, Overton\u2019s tallying of the weapons rollout serves as another reminder of a fundamental institutional disconnect between what the Pentagon expects of its troops and it expects of itself. From their earliest days in uniform, Army and Marine recruits are drilled in the near sanctity of their rifles. They quickly learn that no other item of standard equipment will be more rigidly tracked in the routines of accountability and that inspections will continue throughout their careers. Rifles are to be kept properly lubricated and spotlessly clean. Rifles are to be always at hand. Rifles are to be pointed only where meant to be pointed. Rifles are never to be lost. Everything in the armory and each patrol is to be counted, again and again (and again), so that everyone from private to commander knows that nothing has been misplaced and that the weapons are ready for whatever lies ahead. So thorough does this mentality take hold that more than a few veterans, years after returning to civilian life, can recite the serial numbers of service rifles they carried. Some find themselves involuntarily reaching for rifles throughout the day.When the military distributed weapons in Afghanistan and Iraq, a different dynamic was in play. Keeping track of the weapons in any reliable fashion \u2014 documenting who got what and what went where \u2014 was often not a priority. It is impossible today. And so no one knows where many of the weapons are, until they turn up on social media or announce themselves in combat or crime with the crack of incoming fire, a reminder of tens of billions of dollars gone into nations where violence and terrorism continue apace. What to do? If past is precedent, given enough time one of the United States\u2019 solutions will be, once again, to ship in more guns.C.J. Chivers is a reporter for The Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Air of Graft Around Ex-Argentine Government Arouses Fury", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs prosecutors and judges press ahead with the cases, many Argentines question whether the ruling class can move beyond a culture of graft that has hamstrung the country\u2019s progress. \u201cI\u2019ve given up hope,\u201d said Yolanda Galv\u00e1n, 50, a cashier at a pharmacy here, referring to the country\u2019s history of corruption scandals. \u201cThey all end up being the same.\u201dMs. Galv\u00e1n pointed to public unease regarding President Mauricio Macri, whose offshore business activity \u2014 dating to years before his term began in December \u2014 is being investigated after it was revealed in a leak of the documents known as the Panama Papers. Mr. Macri says he has nothing to hide.Ethical concerns also loom over Mr. Macri\u2019s energy minister, Juan Jos\u00e9 Aranguren, who has more than $1 million of shares in Royal Dutch Shell, the oil company for which he previously worked as an executive. The government says owning the shares is not illegal.But it is the cases implicating the upper echelons of Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s administration that have prompted blistering critiques of Argentina\u2019s shortcomings in tackling graft. Experts say that a brittle institutional framework fosters political corruption, and that a politicized judiciary lets those in office off the hook.In the past, corruption scandals involving the Front for Victory\u2019s former officials were viewed by its supporters as smear campaigns engineered by the news media and sectors of the judiciary hostile to Mrs. Kirchner. But more recently, especially with the arrest of the official in the convent, there appears to be little room for such defenses.The official, Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez, a former public works secretary, was discovered by the police with duffel bags packed with cash, Rolex and Omega watches, and a semiautomatic machine gun in the early hours of June 14 at a convent outside Buenos Aires. He has been indicted on charges of illegal enrichment and is in detention while a judge investigates his case.Argentines from across the political spectrum were quick to condemn Mr. L\u00f3pez, who served as public works secretary for the entire three-term period the Front for Victory was in power.\u201cI believe this is the end of Kirchnerismo as an electoral option,\u201d said Andr\u00e9s Malamud, an Argentine political scientist at the University of Lisbon, using the popularized name for the political philosophy adhered to by followers of Mrs. Kirchner and her predecessor and husband, N\u00e9stor Kirchner, who died in 2010.However, many of those supporters are now starting to doubt her. \u201cThey always defended themselves, but now we\u2019ve realized they were screwing us,\u201d said Jonathan Ramis, 20, a business management student who voted for the Front for Victory in last year\u2019s elections.Those allegations stem from a number of continuing cases that have gripped Argentines in recent years. One is a money-laundering investigation involving L\u00e1zaro B\u00e1ez, a construction baron from Patagonia, who has been indicted and is in jail as the investigation progresses.Investigators have also accused Mr. B\u00e1ez of redirecting some funds from the public-works contracts to the Kirchners via schemes involving the family\u2019s hotel and real estate businesses.Prosecutors are investigating whether Mr. B\u00e1ez\u2019s companies paid for block bookings at hotels without ever occupying the rooms. Similarly, it is alleged that Mr. B\u00e1ez kicked back money to the Kirchners through lease agreements to rent the family\u2019s Patagonian properties.Gerardo Pollicita, the lead prosecutor in the hotels case, turned down several interview requests. But in a recent filing, he wrote that the investigation sought to establish whether Mr. Kirchner and Mrs. Kirchner were engaged in a criminal conspiracy involving \u201ccronies\u201d like Mr. B\u00e1ez who in return for business favors from the government channeled funds to the presidential family.Mrs. Kirchner has directed scorn at Claudio Bonadio, a judge who is guiding the investigation into alleged kickbacks to her family\u2019s real estate business. He was taken off the hotels case last year amid concerns over his impartiality.In an interview at his office at Comodoro Py, a run-down courthouse here, Judge Bonadio denied the existence of a coterie of judges and prosecutors plotting against Mrs. Kirchner. He said he simply worked on whatever cases were sent his way. Judge Bonadio said judges treated criminal law as golfers did a tournament, thinking only of the case file \u2014 or hole \u2014 before them.\u201cWe\u2019re golfers, not baseball players or footballers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe play against the course, not another team.\u201dMany experts contend, however, that Argentina\u2019s judiciary is not independent. Federal judges, said Luis Moreno Ocampo, a leading Argentine anticorruption campaigner who was chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court, tend to operate in favor of whichever politicians are in power, only seriously pursuing them once they leave office.This politicization is often traced back to Mr. Menem, the former president, whose former economy minister once claimed he was passed a napkin by another minister scribbled with the names of judges Mr. Menem controlled. \u201cThe biggest issue is moving Argentina\u2019s legal system out of this swamp,\u201d Mr. Moreno Ocampo said. Still, he added, \u201cthe focus should not just be on past corruption but on preventing future corruption.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Instagram Takes a Page From Snapchat, and Takes Aim at It, Too", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMENLO PARK, Calif. \u2014 For nearly four years, Snapchat has been Facebook\u2019s white whale.Now Instagram, the photo-sharing app owned by Facebook, is for the first time taking its own stab at Snapchat.The move could ignite a head-to-head battle between Instagram and Snapchat, which have long lurked in each other\u2019s territories but have not faced off directly. Both are mobile apps that use primarily visual media. Both became popular first with young people. And both are now trying to improve their businesses by increasing digital advertising in formats like Stories.Kevin Systrom, co-founder and chief executive of Instagram, did not mention Snapchat by name in an interview about Instagram Stories, but obliquely referred to \u201ccompetitors\u201d and acknowledged that \u201cother companies deserve all the credit\u201d for popularizing disappearing photos and videos. It has been an area of interest for Instagram for some time, he said.Instagram Stories aims to lower the bar for sharing all types of photos and video \u2014 and not just the carefully planned and painstakingly touched-up photographs that are typical of the service, Mr. Systrom said.\u201cOur mission has always been to capture and share the world\u2019s moments, not just the world\u2019s most beautiful moments,\u201d he said. \u201cStories will alleviate a ton of the pressure people have to post their absolute best stuff.\u201dA spokeswoman for Snapchat declined to comment on Instagram\u2019s new product.Cathy Boyle, a mobile analyst for the research firm eMarketer, said Instagram\u2019s move \u201cvalidates what Snapchat is doing.\u201d Advertisers are particularly attracted to Snapchat, she said, because the messaging app offers \u201ca place to connect with users in this very personal, immersive way.\u201dSnapchat \u2014 led by Evan Spiegel, who helped found it while an undergraduate at Stanford University \u2014 started in 2011. The private messaging service, with its disappearing photos, was the opposite of the public nature of social media services like Instagram. Young audiences flocked to Snapchat precisely because an unflattering photo sent to a friend would last for mere seconds rather than a lifetime, and would not show up for parents or a future employer to find.Snapchat Stories, a departure from the company\u2019s original direct messaging service, has been a hit for essentially acting as a 24-hour photo and video diary viewable only by those who follow the user.Beyond that, Snapchat Stories also collects photos and videos users have contributed from a particular event \u2014 say the Teen Choice Awards \u2014 and stitches them together to form a narrative. The result feels more like a television show than a social media post; companies like AMC and HP can buy ads that are placed in stories, much like commercials aired in original programming.The rivalry between Snapchat and Instagram was evident in a report published last week from the investment banking firm Jefferies, which predicted that Snapchat\u2019s growth could detract from Instagram\u2019s advertising momentum by as soon as the fourth quarter of this year.\u201cSnapchat consists of a more active user base, which creates more content than the average Instagram user,\u201d the report said. \u201cGiven its younger demographic, we think Instagram looks the most at-risk from the rise of Snapchat, especially on a longer-term basis.\u201dInstagram Stories is now available in a separate section of the app, where users can shoot photos or video, which, as with Snapchat, can be adorned with text or drawings. Those are then combined to create a story, which is viewable by friends for 24 hours. People can make stories public or private, and can choose if they want only a subsection of their followers to view them.Mr. Systrom does not pretend that Instagram Stories is original. Instead, he said the narrative string of photos and video that disappear after 24 hours is a format, akin to the cascading feed-based model popularized by companies like Facebook and Twitter and eventually adopted by countless others. Silicon Valley, he said, is all about creating and adopting new formats to be tried and expanded.\u201cThis format unlocks a new version of creativity for us,\u201d he said. \u201cI think Instagram will be judged by where we go from here, and what we make of it in the future.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why It\u2019s Not Enough Just to Be Disruptive", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother ViewThe unanimous takeaway has been that incumbents everywhere are poised to get their clocks cleaned by a stampede of disruptive insurgents \u2014 unless they buy them first.This analysis, however, misdiagnoses recent transactions as a series of new-versus-old shootouts.To be sure, the web has been grinding down barriers to entry for 20 years, reducing the advantages of incumbents. For new entrants, this flatter playing field creates opportunity. But since the key tools at their disposal are universally available \u2014 including to companies like Facebook and Google, with enormous scale advantages \u2014 this only helps them get into the game, not capture any value lost by legacy firms. Short-term success may be driven by exceptional execution; long-term value creation requires building a defensible model.Any microeconomics textbook will tell you there are limited sources of competitive advantage. The most valuable companies combine several reinforcing strands, like scale and customer loyalty. Gillette has long been, literally, a textbook example.In 1996, Warren E. Buffett, then the largest shareholder in Gillette, commented: \u201cYou go to bed feeling very comfortable just thinking about two and a half billion males with hair growing while you sleep. No one at Gillette has trouble sleeping.\u201dBut 20 years later, management at Gillette (long since acquired by Procter & Gamble) is probably tossing and turning a little more. Gillette\u2019s scale still provides formidable advantages (wide retail distribution, superior patented technology through large R.&D. investment), and its well-known brand (reinforced through mass-media advertising) creates a strong habit in loyal customers acquired early in their lives.However, those advantages are plainly no longer as formidable as they were at the company\u2019s zenith. For an insurgent like Dollar Shave Club, online sales reduce the impact of Gillette\u2019s big lead in drugstore shelf space, and cloud-computing services reduce the required upfront technology investment. Targeted direct marketing on Facebook and other social channels obviates the need for a mass-media campaign, while customer reviews and word-of-mouth can spread the word. At the high end, Gillette\u2019s patented, multi-blade, vibrating razor is a tough opponent, so naturally new entrants focus on the entry level \u2014 where they can rebrand cheap, no-name blades to compete.In Jet\u2019s case, the serial entrepreneur Marc Lore was able to build a large e-commerce company for a few hundred million dollars in just a couple of years by taking an innovative approach to pricing and distribution. And Walmart is plainly convinced that Jet\u2019s expertise and momentum will help it compete with Amazon. Jet\u2019s negative gross margins, which would have required large continuing investments, will disappear when combined with Walmart\u2019s purchasing and distribution scale.While it is hard to stay ahead solely through superior execution over an extended period, it is sometimes enough in the short term to draw a deep-pocketed buyer where there are strong, immediate synergies. Creating enormous value over the long term requires turning a tactical edge into some form of durable advantage.While there are plenty of extraordinary start-ups creating new markets with a path to genuine advantage, self-described \u201cdisrupters\u201d often find that the same forces that allowed them to get going initially also let in a horde of rivals. Competition drains away profit.This is particularly likely where the \u201cdisruptive innovation\u201d does not greatly change the cost structure or end-user experience. Putting a thin layer of software on a people-intensive service business, for instance, may win some immediate sales against Luddite competitors, but it is not necessarily sustainable, nor will it conjure up fat margins. New and existing competitors can often spiff up their supporting tech, too.As the Columbia Business School Professor Bruce C. Greenwald pointed out in his book \u201cCompetition Demystified,\u201d product differentiation on its own is not the basis for sustainable advantage. In his renowned example, \u201calmost everybody makes toasters\u201d \u2014 and if consumers one day demanded \u201ctoasters that sing when the bread is ready\u201d \u2014 soon every manufacturer would offer a \u201ccrooning toaster.\u201dThe rise of web-fueled competition is plainly inexorable. Computers are infinitely patient and accurate in comparing prices and opportunities, and now companies can provide a complete set of services to atomize the fixed costs formerly required for market entry.However, despite the threat to profits, there is no cause for gloom. Superior tactical execution can still create real value, particularly where it provides ammunition for a bigger war (like Walmart\u2019s battle with Amazon). And in the long term, value is created not by disruption, but by weaving together advantages (as both Amazon and Walmart have done in different ways) that together create a barrier that is hard to storm.Jeremy G. Philips is a general partner at Spark Capital and an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School.Advertisement"}

This week, he is in Rio de Janeiro covering his eighth Olympic Games. Despite that experience, he says he has found it more difficult to shoot each successive trip.\u201cYou think you know what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing, but there are always new moments and new human drama,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can plan for many things like remote cameras, close-ups and clean, beautiful pictures with shadows and color. But there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always a moment that you can never plan for that you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to miss.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIt is always a challenge to find clever, new photographs but the images that show human dignity are the most important to him. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s usually a single moment, he said, that defines an athlete and reveals his or her lifelong struggle to reach the Olympics.Mr. Lee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own road to the Olympics was one that he could not have imagined growing up in Pusan, South Korea. He said he had no interest in sports before moving to the United States after high school, but that the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul had piqued his interest. While working delivering pizza in Leonia, N.J., to support his English studies he said he had no time to watch the Games on television. But he said he knew something big was happening.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI heard people screaming from their home and I really hoped I could watch,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I was just delivering the pizza.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe learned how to deliver the photographic goods after he enrolled at New York University, studied photography and, in 1994, became a photo intern at The Times. His first assignment was covering the celebration at Madison Square Garden after the New York Rangers had won the Stanley Cup for the first time in 54 years. He had no idea what ice hockey was, but one of his photographs made the front page of The Times\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Metro section. He was hired as a staff photographer a few months later.As the newest photographer, he worked the night shift, which meant covering sports several times a week. He soon learned the ins and outs of baseball, football, basketball and even hockey (which he discovered uses a flat puck \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not a ball). His strong graphic sense and excellent hand-eye coordination made him quite adept at photographing sports, and his early adoption of digital photography allowed him to effortlessly transmit images on deadline.He was soon assigned to almost all the major sporting events, including the World Series and other championship games. At the same time, he covered many international stories and was part of two Pulitzer Prize-winning teams that covered the Sept. 11 attacks and the war in Afghanistan.In Brazil, he is part of a New York Times photo team that includes photographers Doug Mills, Mauricio Lima and James Hill, and led by photo editors Becky Lebowitz and Jeffrey Furticella.Before the games begin, Mr. Lee, 48, is meeting venue managers, checking locations for remote cameras and making sure that the internet connections will work. He is also looking for shooting positions that might lead to a photo different from any that he has made before.\u201cWorking for the Times, I have great freedom in deciding how I want to shoot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe editors discuss what is important in the story but they rarely tell us how to shoot. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all up to us. We can take a risk to make a better picture.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn a way, photographing the Olympics is quite like an Olympic sport itself. There will be hundreds of credentialed photographers competing with Mr. Lee for the best photos in Rio this month. Among the attributes that will separate them will be concentration, instantaneous physical response and years of training and experience.But what truly makes for a gold medal Olympic image is more than a winning combination of eye, mind and body.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you see the picture with your own eyes it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too late,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Lee said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut if you see the picture before it happens, then it can be yours.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

{"Headline": "Olympic Cover-Up: Why You Won\u2019t See Some Shoe Logos", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "Supported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The track and field events at the Rio Olympics this month will showcase elite athletic talent and, if you look closely, creative subterfuge.Tape, markers, elastic sleeves and maybe even paint will disguise some shoe brand logos in an Olympic sleight of foot.In track and field, the centerpiece sport of the Summer Games, shoes are the most vital piece of equipment and serve purposes beyond performance: supplying advertising billboards for apparel companies and providing financial footing for athletes. But some athletes do not want the world to see the logos on their shoes, or they are prohibited from doing so by their sponsors if they wear competing brands.Although United States track and field athletes at the Rio Games must wear uniforms bearing the familiar swoosh of Nike, an official team sponsor, they are free to wear their own brand of shoes, disguised or not.Take, for example, Jeremy Taiwo, a decathlete from Seattle who will wear eight pairs of shoes in his 10 events, each with a function as specific as a golf club\u2019s.His shoe sponsor is Brooks, but the company does not make shoes designed for throwing and jumping events. So Taiwo also plans to wear shoes made by Nike, Adidas and Asics. He must cover the logos of those competing brands, which he plans to do with tape, elastic sleeves and cleverly shaded fabric.\u201cIn terms of athletic performance, you have to have the right shoes to be able to meet your goals,\u201d Taiwo, 26, said in a telephone interview before traveling to Rio de Janeiro. \u201cAnd ultimately, you have to do well so you can get paid. If you make it, your shoes are largely responsible for that.\u201dThe camouflaging demonstrates the power of the $75 billion global athletic footwear industry, which closely monitors what athletes wear \u2014 and, with lawyers at its beck and call, what they do not.Although it is unclear how many athletes will be disguising their footwear at the Games, the practice is not uncommon at track meets, with the reasons for the cover-ups almost as varied as the shoes available.Athletes who have no shoe sponsor may not want to give free advertising to any company, preferring to signal that they are free agents. Taiwo called this an act of \u201cno representation without compensation.\u201dOther athletes disguise shoes because they are transitioning from one company to another and are continuing to wear their old shoes while new ones are being perfected. Some, like Taiwo, participate in events for which their sponsor does not make shoes. Some athletes are simply dissatisfied with the gear made by their sponsor.Sometimes, shoe companies give permission for athletes to wear another, disguised brand. Other times, they take umbrage, and the controversy becomes public.Nike did not say why the contract offer was rescinded, only that Walker \u201cdid not take up this option in a timely manner.\u201d Walker put his gear up for sale on eBay.Mike Hazle, the 2011 American champion in the javelin, said his Nike-made shoes were too narrow, causing his toenails to fall off and his feet to become numb. So for years, he said, he borrowed gear made by Asics and Li-Ning, a Chinese company, from a fellow javelin thrower. He covered those logos with tape or with slices from wristbands that bore the Nike swoosh.It was never a problem in the little-noticed event, Hazle said, until he won the United States title and a photograph of him appeared in Track & Field News. His left foot was raised after a throw, revealing the check-mark logo of Li-Ning on the bottom of his shoe.Nike was not pleased and exercised an option on his contract in 2012 to keep him from signing with another company, Hazle said, but offered only $10,000 with no chance of bonuses.It is unfortunate \u201cif someone is paying your bills and you\u2019re supposed to wear what they give you and it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Hazle said from Afghanistan, where he is serving in the Air National Guard. \u201cBut at the end of the day, it\u2019s going to compromise your performance, so you\u2019ve got to take care of yourself.\u201dNike said it did not comment on contracts but expected that its sponsored athletes \u201cwill always wear Nike products unless there is some specific, mutually agreed exception.\u201dOne high-profile exception took place last year. Christian Taylor of the United States, who won the triple jump at the 2012 Olympics and signed with Nike in 2015, was permitted to wear Adidas shoes at the world track and field championships in Beijing while Nike customized shoes for him. Taylor, the triple jump favorite at this year\u2019s Olympics, now wears Nikes.Two medal favorites in the high jump, Mutaz Essa Barshim of Qatar and Derek Drouin of Canada, have also been permitted by Nike to wear shoes from other brands that are covered by elastic sleeves resembling spats that bear the Nike swoosh.\u201cAs with any athlete, we are working closely with them to get the shoe that best suits their specific needs,\u201d Charlie Brooks, a Nike spokesman, said in an email. \u201cThere\u2019s no issue with our shoes; it\u2019s just a matter of personal customization for these athletes. We anticipate they\u2019ll be jumping in Nike shoes soon.\u201dCamouflaging reflects the particular nature of track and field, which finds itself in the limelight every four years during the Summer Games.Sprinters, pole-vaulters and steeplechasers generally do not receive annual salaries from teams the way professional football and basketball players do. Instead, they mostly rely on prize money and contracts with shoe companies, along with other endorsements.The apparel companies, Nike in particular, wield strong influence. They equip athletes and keep the struggling sport afloat. But they can also reduce payments when certain performance goals are not met. And at certain meets like the Olympics, athletes are restricted from wearing competing sponsor logos on their uniforms and as temporary tattoos.The number of track meets is dwindling, as are the available prize money and appearance fees, athletes and agents say. Rampant doping has threatened the legitimacy of the sport. Income disparity is wide.Carl Lewis, a nine-time Olympic gold medalist who has had a long affiliation with Nike, said the camouflaging of shoes was \u201ca microcosm of what the real issue is: Are we really creating a professional sport?\u201d\u201cWhy are we so dependent on just shoe companies?\u201d said Lewis, an assistant coach at the University of Houston.Some athletes said they considered it disrespectful and unprofessional to cover up the logo of a sponsor.\u201cIf they\u2019re paying money, the least we can do is respect their dollar,\u201d said Wallace Spearmon of the United States, a 200-meter sprinter and a former Nike athlete.Other athletes owe no allegiance because they have no shoe sponsor.Johnny Dutch of the United States has run the fastest time in the world this year in the 400-meter hurdles. But he said he had been without a shoe sponsor for three years, since his Nike contract ended. At the Olympic track and field trials in July in Eugene, Ore., Dutch wore shoes that were spray-painted neon orange to cover the logos of Nike and two other brands.This was done, in part, to express his artistic side, said Dutch, 27, an aspiring filmmaker. But it was also his way of saying that, for him to display any shoe company logo, \u201cthey\u2019ve got to support me,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to give me something where I can live and pay my medical bills.\u201dMoney had become so tight, Dutch said, that he had moved from Miami to live with his parents in Raleigh, N.C. His chance to gain visibility and financial buoyancy as an Olympian disappeared when Dutch clipped the final hurdle in the 400-meter hurdles at the trials and faded from first place to fifth.Only the top three advanced to Rio. Disconsolate, Dutch said he intended to retire.\u201cI feel like I can\u2019t do this no more,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI\u2019ve been struggling financially. I don\u2019t have a contract. I have no job.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thailand Junta Seeks to Extend Its Power With Constitutional Referendum", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "Supported byBANGKOK \u2014 Two years after seizing power, Thailand\u2019s military junta will hold a national referendum Sunday on a new constitution that it casts as an essential step toward restoring democracy.But the junta has blocked opponents from campaigning against the measure, banned election monitors and restricted news coverage of the referendum. And the proposed constitution, critics say, would weaken the role of elected officials and extend the military\u2019s influence for years to come.The vote will be the first major test of the military\u2019s standing with the public, as much a referendum on the legitimacy of military rule as on the draft constitution. But no matter the outcome, the junta will remain in control until it decides to hand power back to an elected government.For Thailand, which changes constitutions more often than the United States changes presidents, the proposed charter is not necessarily expected to endure. But it seeks to reduce the influence of any one politician or party, a measure that seems particularly directed at populist leaders who appeal to the poorer rural population of northern Thailand.\u201cThe idea is to craft the rules and the institutions to rebalance power and authority from the previous decade,\u201d said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political-science professor at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok. \u201cThe goal is to keep the political party system fragmented to bring about a fragile coalition government that will not be dominated by a single party.\u201dThe junta, which has portrayed itself as the only institution capable of maintaining stability in the bitterly divided country, says that by minimizing the influence of any party, the new political structure would help prevent corruption and bring fairness to government.But if the aim is democracy, the means are hardly reassuring.At least 120 opponents of the proposed constitution have been arrested on suspicion of distributing false information about the measure, which carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison, or of violating other campaign restrictions, including a ban on assemblies of more than five people, said Sunai Phasuk, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch.\u201cThis referendum is not legitimate,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a redo of a military coup, using fear and intimidation to force Thai people to grant an extension of their control of power.\u201dThe military has defended the restrictions on opposition campaigning, as well as the banning of party election monitors and the arrest and office search of a journalist who was covering opposition activists.Panitan Wattanayagorn, an adviser to Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha, the junta chief and prime minister, said the public did not need an election campaign that could lead to more strife. Voters can decide by studying the 105-page document, he said.\u201cThe government is asking people to read the 279 articles themselves and use their own judgment and go vote on Aug. 7,\u201d he said in an interview.The yellow shirts, including royalists and middle-class urbanites in southern Thailand, have long opposed the siblings\u2019 populist rule.The military\u2019s strategy is to reduce the influence of her party by increasing the power of other parties and the military.Those changes would increase the representation of medium-size parties and virtually assure that no party could win a majority or govern without forming a coalition.\u201cThe section on the parliamentary system is quite new in many regards,\u201d said Mr. Panitan, the junta adviser. \u201cIt\u2019s an attempt to control and regulate the politicians.\u201dA companion ballot measure would give the junta the authority to appoint all 250 Senate members, who would serve five-year terms. The Senate would join the lower house in selecting the prime minister, giving the military influence over the government long after the junta is dissolved.Critics say these measures will weaken political parties, but at the expense of democracy.Professor Thitinan said red- shirts and some yellow shirts might reject the proposed constitution because of dissatisfaction with years of military rule.Either way, he notes, the military will remain in power for the foreseeable future. Rejection of the referendum would give the junta a chance to try again with a new proposal.For that reason, some voters say they will stay away from the polls.\u201cVoting would be considered accepting this rule, but I don\u2019t accept this rule,\u201d said Thanee Keawwanna, 46, a tile company supervisor in Chiang Mai Province. \u201cIf the no-vote wins, we will be asking, what responsibility will the junta take? Will they quit?\u201dMr. Panitan said the junta planned to hold elections in 2017 regardless of the outcome on Sunday, although the elections could take place later in the year if the proposed constitution was rejected.At that point, he said, General Prayuth will step down.\u201cThe prime minister has already decided the elections will happen,\u201d Mr. Panitan said. \u201cFor the prime minister, his service is almost done.\u201dSome voters, eager to see the country move on, said that was reason enough to support the proposal.\u201cI will vote to accept it as we need to have a constitution,\u201d said Supop Promminlat, 44, a rice farmer in Chiang Mai Province. \u201cWe have to have rule of law. If we do not accept it, we will be living in this situation for a long time.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Air of Graft Around Ex-Argentine Government Arouses Fury", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "Supported byAs prosecutors and judges press ahead with the cases, many Argentines question whether the ruling class can move beyond a culture of graft that has hamstrung the country\u2019s progress. \u201cI\u2019ve given up hope,\u201d said Yolanda Galv\u00e1n, 50, a cashier at a pharmacy here, referring to the country\u2019s history of corruption scandals. \u201cThey all end up being the same.\u201dMs. Galv\u00e1n pointed to public unease regarding President Mauricio Macri, whose offshore business activity \u2014 dating to years before his term began in December \u2014 is being investigated after it was revealed in a leak of the documents known as the Panama Papers. Mr. Macri says he has nothing to hide.Ethical concerns also loom over Mr. Macri\u2019s energy minister, Juan Jos\u00e9 Aranguren, who has more than $1 million of shares in Royal Dutch Shell, the oil company for which he previously worked as an executive. The government says owning the shares is not illegal.But it is the cases implicating the upper echelons of Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s administration that have prompted blistering critiques of Argentina\u2019s shortcomings in tackling graft. Experts say that a brittle institutional framework fosters political corruption, and that a politicized judiciary lets those in office off the hook.In the past, corruption scandals involving the Front for Victory\u2019s former officials were viewed by its supporters as smear campaigns engineered by the news media and sectors of the judiciary hostile to Mrs. Kirchner. But more recently, especially with the arrest of the official in the convent, there appears to be little room for such defenses.The official, Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez, a former public works secretary, was discovered by the police with duffel bags packed with cash, Rolex and Omega watches, and a semiautomatic machine gun in the early hours of June 14 at a convent outside Buenos Aires. He has been indicted on charges of illegal enrichment and is in detention while a judge investigates his case.Argentines from across the political spectrum were quick to condemn Mr. L\u00f3pez, who served as public works secretary for the entire three-term period the Front for Victory was in power.\u201cI believe this is the end of Kirchnerismo as an electoral option,\u201d said Andr\u00e9s Malamud, an Argentine political scientist at the University of Lisbon, using the popularized name for the political philosophy adhered to by followers of Mrs. Kirchner and her predecessor and husband, N\u00e9stor Kirchner, who died in 2010.However, many of those supporters are now starting to doubt her. \u201cThey always defended themselves, but now we\u2019ve realized they were screwing us,\u201d said Jonathan Ramis, 20, a business management student who voted for the Front for Victory in last year\u2019s elections.Those allegations stem from a number of continuing cases that have gripped Argentines in recent years. One is a money-laundering investigation involving L\u00e1zaro B\u00e1ez, a construction baron from Patagonia, who has been indicted and is in jail as the investigation progresses.Investigators have also accused Mr. B\u00e1ez of redirecting some funds from the public-works contracts to the Kirchners via schemes involving the family\u2019s hotel and real estate businesses.Prosecutors are investigating whether Mr. B\u00e1ez\u2019s companies paid for block bookings at hotels without ever occupying the rooms. Similarly, it is alleged that Mr. B\u00e1ez kicked back money to the Kirchners through lease agreements to rent the family\u2019s Patagonian properties.Gerardo Pollicita, the lead prosecutor in the hotels case, turned down several interview requests. But in a recent filing, he wrote that the investigation sought to establish whether Mr. Kirchner and Mrs. Kirchner were engaged in a criminal conspiracy involving \u201ccronies\u201d like Mr. B\u00e1ez who in return for business favors from the government channeled funds to the presidential family.Mrs. Kirchner has directed scorn at Claudio Bonadio, a judge who is guiding the investigation into alleged kickbacks to her family\u2019s real estate business. He was taken off the hotels case last year amid concerns over his impartiality.In an interview at his office at Comodoro Py, a run-down courthouse here, Judge Bonadio denied the existence of a coterie of judges and prosecutors plotting against Mrs. Kirchner. He said he simply worked on whatever cases were sent his way. Judge Bonadio said judges treated criminal law as golfers did a tournament, thinking only of the case file \u2014 or hole \u2014 before them.\u201cWe\u2019re golfers, not baseball players or footballers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe play against the course, not another team.\u201dMany experts contend, however, that Argentina\u2019s judiciary is not independent. Federal judges, said Luis Moreno Ocampo, a leading Argentine anticorruption campaigner who was chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court, tend to operate in favor of whichever politicians are in power, only seriously pursuing them once they leave office.This politicization is often traced back to Mr. Menem, the former president, whose former economy minister once claimed he was passed a napkin by another minister scribbled with the names of judges Mr. Menem controlled. \u201cThe biggest issue is moving Argentina\u2019s legal system out of this swamp,\u201d Mr. Moreno Ocampo said. Still, he added, \u201cthe focus should not just be on past corruption but on preventing future corruption.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Playing off celebrated co-stars like Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig, she is able to steal even the scenes in which she has no dialogue with just a gaudy grimace or a roll of her eyes.Not that Ms. McKinnon thinks of herself this way. \u201cI pride myself on being tragically uncool,\u201d she explained in an interview on Tuesday.\u201cI\u2019m wearing cat socks right now,\u201d she said in her dry, Hepburn-esque drawl. \u201cBut I\u2019m wearing them just for the utilitarian purpose of wearing socks.\u201dOver lunch at a vegan restaurant in Manhattan, she spoke about her \u201cGhostbusters\u201d experience and the distinctions she draws between her characters and herself. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.You made such specific choices in your portrayal of Holtzmann. How did you approach the role?I just wanted to make a character who was very alien but so joyful and earnest and fascinated by the world that you would relate to her anyway. In the script, there were these moments where she would be talking so lackadaisically about an extraordinarily lethal piece of equipment. I thought, what sort of a person could let that terror slide off her shoulders? But I noticed that I underreact in a similar way, in a lot of situations.How so?In most combat scenarios, I find that I\u2019m pretty steady. [laughs] No, seriously. \u201cS.N.L.\u201d can be a stressful environment, and I am panicking constantly, but I guess I keep it pretty internal. Because I\u2019ve been told that I seem calm-ish.Did you consult with any real-life scientists?I\u2019ve been a big astrophysics nut since I was 12. I have always had a real soft spot for the bizarreness of quantum mechanics. But I gave up on being a scientist in high school \u2014 I\u2019m just not that good at math. So that ticks me off, that I\u2019ve limited myself and my life choices in that way. I will never be a theoretical physicist.Who devised her wardrobe and hairstyle? No. I\u2019m so sorry.Do you think it\u2019s significant that moviegoers who don\u2019t see themselves represented onscreen are identifying with her?I wanted Holtzmann to be a general champion for the disenfranchised and the other. And I hope that she appeals to anyone who feels like that.She did text, and she was deeply, deeply disturbed and upset. As anyone would be. I said that I love her and she\u2019s gorgeous. And she should get off Twitter. [chuckles] But that\u2019s not a solution. \u201cJust don\u2019t read it\u201d is not a solution.You don\u2019t have a social media presence \u2014 I imagine that didn\u2019t change your mind?Even when Facebook came out and I was in college, I found myself never putting anything on it. It just feels unnatural to me to broadcast anything other than the character I\u2019ve created.You\u2019re very modest in person, yet you play many over-the-top characters. Where do they come from, I wonder?You and my therapist. [laughs] There must be some exhibitionist tendency that I funnel into these other people. I think it comes from wanting to share and to connect, to offer up for display something that I find delightful and fascinating. I hope that if other people feel the same way then we\u2019ve made a connection. That\u2019s the way I feel most comfortable connecting.Are you paying close attention to the presidential election to gather more material on Hillary Clinton?I\u2019m following it because we\u2019re at a real moment right now. But also because I feel very connected to her, in a strange way. I spend so many hours studying her and imagining her inner life that I feel like we\u2019re very close. Even though I don\u2019t have her phone number.She was very warm and charming and sincere. And I liked being around her, and I felt a similarity to her, in that I am a very accomplished legal scholar and have spent my life crusading for the middle class.Have you ever met Justice Ginsburg? Are you already thinking about \u201cS.N.L.\u201d starting up in the fall?Will you go back to \u201cS.N.L.\u201d with more visibility because of all the praise you\u2019ve received this summer?That would be hellish. What makes this current cast so strong is that there\u2019s fairly equitable distribution of real estate within the show, and everyone has such a different voice and really gets to use that. It feels like a real ensemble. Before getting hired there, I did mostly one-woman shows, and I liked being the only weird one onstage. But that gets old real fast, not just for me but for people watching.Has there been any talk of a \u201cGhostbusters\u201d sequel?I haven\u2019t heard. I haven\u2019t been doing that much. I literally don\u2019t know what I did the last two weeks. I know that I had a consultation about window dressings with a lady who was very knowledgeable. That took up a big part of my psychic energy.What would be your dream role to play?My manager asks me this every day, and I don\u2019t quite have the answer. What I want is to play as many as possible. I really like collections of things. I love antique botanical prints with a bunch of different weeds and seeds. I love the produce section at the grocery store. A panoply of gorgeous, fascinating distinct objects with a common theme, is what I would love to build for the rest of my career, as long as they\u2019ll have me.A picture caption on Thursday with an article about the comic actress Kate McKinnon, using information from the Wu Liang Ye restaurant in Manhattan, where Ms. McKinnon was shown, misstated the name of the executive chef there.

A generation is protesting.\u201dAnalysts fear that separatist groups that had been more or less vanquished in recent years, like the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the turbulence and rearm.Several factors explain why bitter feelings, after years of simmering beneath the surface, are exploding now.The first is seemingly innocuous: smartphones.Only in the last couple of years have large numbers of Ethiopians been able to communicate using social media as cheaper smartphones became common and internet service improves. Even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it frequently does, especially during protests, many people are still able to communicate via internet proxies that mask where they are. Several young Ethiopians said this was how they gathered for protests.Second, there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, Ethiopia\u2019s two largest ethnic groups. Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies. For eons, Amharas from Ethiopia\u2019s predominantly Christian highlands flourished in politics and business, exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslim and live in lowland areas.But that is changing as well.\u201cWe are on the way to coordinate under one umbrella,\u201d said Mulatu Gemechu, an Oromo leader.The biggest protests have been in Amhara and Oromo areas. Many Amharas and Oromos feel Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and dominates the military, the intelligence services, commerce and politics.Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia\u2019s prime minister for 17 years, until his death from an undisclosed illness in 2012. He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around corners. Analysts say he was especially adept at detecting early signals of discontent and using emissaries to massage and defang opponents.\u201cThe current regime lacks that ground savvy,\u201d Mr. Abdi, the conflict analyst, said.Ethiopia\u2019s new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was plucked from relative obscurity to fill Mr. Meles\u2019s shoes. Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam is a southerner. Analysts say he does not have the trust of the Tigrayan-controlled security services.The result, many fear, is more bloodshed. The last time Ethiopia experienced such turmoil was in 2005, after thousands protested over what analysts have said appeared to be an election the government bungled and then stole. In the ensuing crackdown, many protesters were killed, though fewer than in recent months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.Development experts have praised Ethiopia\u2019s leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and measurable strides in fighting poverty. But clearly that has not stopped the internal resentment of Ethiopia\u2019s government from intensifying. And it is taking a dangerous ethnic shape.Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amhara town, attacked businesses owned by Tigrayans, and anti-Tigrayan hatred is becoming more common in social media.Analysts say the protests are putting the United States and other Western allies in an awkward position. The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, though it recently said it had closed that base.While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its ally in an already volatile region to crumble.\u201cThat,\u201d Mr. Abdi said, \u201cis a very tight rope to walk.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Shadow of Crime in City Parks", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe data add up to less than one crime per day per park, as a New York Police Department spokesman put it, noting that the parks account for a tiny percentage of crime citywide, which at any rate is lower than it has been in decades.In other words, look around: If you can see trees, benches and squirrels, you are safer than practically anywhere else in the city.The Police Department, of course, can never be complacent about preventing violence in a city of more than eight million people that is both one of the world\u2019s top tourist attractions and one of the top potential terrorism targets. It should not ignore the threats that can crop up in unexpected places, even as it focuses enforcement on serious threats like gangs and guns in high-crime precincts.These crimes are all the more frightening because they pierce the sense of security that so many New Yorkers now feel. But as alarming as high-profile crimes can be, it helps to keep sight of the bigger picture. After years of regaining a more peaceable city, street by street and park by park, many New Yorkers have rediscovered the ability to be shocked by crime instead of numbed by it. Stare at an image long enough and you might start to see what you\u2019re looking for, and frighten yourself. The \u201csurge\u201d in crime in the parks is more about fear than facts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The One That Got Away: How an Elusive Fish Captured a New York Town", "Date": "2016-08-05", "News": "Supported bySCHENECTADY, N.Y. \u2014 It began, as so many eyebrow-raising stories do, with a tale about a fish.\u201cIt looks like a dinosaur, a prehistoric predator,\u201d Mr. Canavan, 20, said. His hunch that it wasn\u2019t supposed to be in Iroquois Lake, in the center of the perhaps aspirationally named Central Park, clashed with his catch-and-release credo. He let the creature thrashing at the end of his line go. \u201cLet it swim another day,\u201d he said.But just as all fish stories bulge and warp over time, the tale of Mr. Canavan\u2019s strange catch has since morphed into an epic. Along the way, it has hooked the imaginations of this industrial, upstate city of slightly over 65,000.Before Mr. Canavan freed the gar on July 17, he took a photograph of the fish that was some 1,200 miles away from its natural habitat to post on social media. His mother, who works at Union College here, shared the image on Facebook. A professor at the college spotted it and contacted the United States Geological Survey, which notified the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, according to Mr. Canavan.Agents from the department happened to be in the area, and knew right away that the gar should not be in the lake, said Chris VanMaaren, the agency\u2019s fisheries manager for the region. Mr. VanMaaren believes it may have been an aquarium pet, dumped into the water after growing too large. But in liberating it, its owner introduced an invasive species, an apex predator with a taste for sunfish that could harm the local ecosystem. Parkgoers also worried that it could take off a toe, though this seems more urban lore than anything based on scientific fact.So on July 27, two environmental protection agents plied a johnboat through the lake\u2019s waters in search of the gar. The flat-bottomed vessel was equipped with a device that sends out an electrical pulse designed to stun, not kill, fish. But after hours of work \u2014 as seems to be the way with mysterious aquatic sightings the world over \u2014 the long, thin gar was nowhere to be found among the stunned sunfish the agents collected, all of which were briskly revived and released. \u201cThey don\u2019t receive the electricity as well as a shorter, fatter fish,\u201d Mr. VanMaaren said. \u201cThey are typically hard to corner, so to speak.\u201dWith just one gar on the loose, and unlikely to survive an upstate winter, the agency had no plans to try again, Mr. VanMaaren said. (If the gar was caught, it would most likely be preserved in ethanol and exhibited at the New York State Museum in Albany, according to state officials. Adoption would be considered, however, if there were appropriate offers.)Enter the mayor of Schenectady, Gary McCarthy. He decided to take things into his own hands and pockets, offering a $100 reward from his wallet to anyone who caught the gar. \u201cIt\u2019s been elusive,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said.Enter the townspeople. Since Mr. McCarthy\u2019s offer, the park, moribund even on an August day, according to residents, has been packed. Its shoreline bristles with anglers of all ages. At Goldstock\u2019s Sporting Goods, in nearby Scotia, weekly sales of rods have quintupled to 25 a week. \u201cI love it, are you kidding?\u201d an owner, Mike Kausch, 61, said, referring to the gar. \u201cI should put one out there every couple days!\u201dThe fishermen and women seem driven by their own dreams. Liam Berry, 9, said he would use his winnings to take his family on a trip. He was disappointed to learn that gars prefer raw chicken and bacon over the three dozen lures he brought. Nearby, his competition, David Bryk, also 9, was fishing to finance his dream pet \u2014 a frog. Its name? \u201cCarlos, of course.\u201dOther people sat on the benches around the lake and quietly rooted for the gar. \u201cIt\u2019s not given fair odds in a little rinky-dink hole like this,\u201d Lisa Monfils, 46, said as her son, Alex Rossler, 12, reeled in yet another sunny in his search for the gar.As the hot summer weeks have wound on, a strange new twist has emerged from the pond: How is it possible, with scores of fishers dangling gar favorites like chicken livers and crispy baitfish at all hours of the day, that sunfish keep falling for the lure, but the gar has eluded what seems to be an entire town?Sitting in his rocking chair at Wiggly Worm Bait and Fishing Supply, in Ballston Lake, a few miles away, William Ingles, the shop\u2019s 92-year-old founder, had a theory: \u201cYou say, \u2018Wait a minute. All of a sudden we got 30, 40, 50 ones out there trying to catch this fish, and all of a sudden nobody\u2019s catching it?\u2019\u201d Perhaps, he mused, the gar was already gone. \u201cWhat would you do if someone caught the fish, and ate the fish, and everyone\u2019s still out there fishing?\u201dNear him a foot-thick encyclopedia of fish sat open to the entry for alligator gar (lepisosteus spatula), prepared for the daily onslaught of customer questions. (\u201cThe alligator gar has been under siege for much of the 20th century,\u201d the entry reads, under the \u201cill advised notion of ridding the water of gamefish-killing monsters.\u201d)As another week of the alligator gar\u2019s continued evasion loomed, the fish tale came full circle. Mr. Canavan said on Friday night that he was at Iroquois Lake that afternoon when a man caught the fish. \u201cMy leader was hanging from its mouth,\u201d he said. That is how he knew it was the same fish.Efforts to reach the mayor about the reward late on Friday were unsuccessful.Christopher Mele contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Laurie the Moose Lady Puts \u2018Heart and Soul\u2019 Into Roadkill", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Laurie Speakman is passionate about moose meat.Partly it is the flavor of the meat, which to her is milder than beef, and great on the barbecue. What matters even more, she said, is moose meat for charity.So it irks her, she said, when moose go missing. Under state law, animals struck and killed on Alaska\u2019s highways are state property and may be handled only by authorized groups like the federation. But illegal carcass harvesting is occurring with increasing frequency in Alaska, said the group\u2019s executive director, Don Dyer, who just last week stumbled upon evidence that pointed to moose theft.\u201cThis last Sunday about 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, we got a call, and we got out there and someone had cut an entire shoulder out of a moose,\u201d Mr. Dyer said in a telephone interview. \u201cSome people out there say, \u2018Well, it\u2019s just roadkill,\u2019 and if they\u2019re hungry, they\u2019re entitled to it, but the fact of the matter is that when somebody steals a whole moose, it impacts a lot of people.\u201dThe goal of distributing meat from animals killed on the road is not new in Alaska, but before the creation of the federation in 2002, that meant butchering the animal where it died. The work could take a team two or three hours, cutting up 250 to 300 pounds of meat or more, sometimes in dangerous traffic and brutal weather. Transport by the federation\u2019s drivers \u2014 there are now six, including Ms. Speakman \u2014 cleared crash sites faster and saved time and money for state troopers.People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, for example, the advocacy group better known by its acronym, PETA, has endorsed the harvest of animals killed on the road as a more ethical and humane way to get meat than through commercial agriculture practices that use feedlots and slaughterhouses.And at least one academic who has studied the issue said he believed evolution was changing the behavior of animal populations, which have learned to adapt to the ribbons of highway and the shiny machines that roar past day and night.The legal wrinkles of harvesting animals killed on the road vary. In Idaho, for example, people are required to call a wildlife worker or law enforcement official to kill an injured animal before it can be taken. In Washington, salvagers can load a dead deer or elk into their vehicle and drive away, but they must contact the Department of Fish and Wildlife within 24 hours to get a permit.Ms. Speakman said she feels loved by those she helps. Several local organizations and Alaska Native tribal groups regularly give her gas cards to help out.\u201cI\u2019ve had a few charities that made me breakfast. Some will give me coffee. I kind of get spoiled a little bit,\u201d she said. But she draws the line at taking any meat for herself. \u201cI\u2019ve had a couple of charities offer some to me, and I will not accept it \u2014 there are needy families out there, and I don\u2019t want to take away from them.\u201dShe gets her moose meat by hunting. And she is thinking of eventually writing her own moose-meat cookbook. \u201cI\u2019ve got some recipes,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Rio Olympics, the National Anthem Sounds \u2026 Sad?", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The playing of the United States\u2019 national anthem at Olympic medal ceremonies is bringing tears to the eyes of American athletes here. Elsewhere, the song is having a very different effect.\u201cIt is driving me crazy,\u201d said Jason DeBord, a 45-year-old living in Ann Arbor, Mich. \u201cI hit the mute button, or I make dinner, or I just sit there and brace myself.\u201dDeBord has nothing against displays of patriotism, nor is he simply eager to return to the action. What irritates him is the version of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d being used at the Olympics. Put bluntly, it has been butchered.O.K., that might overstate the problem. Maybe it would be more accurate to say the song has been altered in ways that rob it of its oomph, its power and its optimistic essence.Specifically, DeBord said, this \u201cBanner\u201d segues several times to minor chords, which in the Western canon are considered melancholic, in places where major chords, which are heartier and more upbeat, are the norm. The effect, DeBord said, is a rendering of the anthem that is darker and sadder.\u201cIt has a totally different emotional feel,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is supposed to have an ascending chord structure. Instead, it sort of has a descending chord structure.\u201dIn short, this is a defeatist \u201cStar-Spangled Banner,\u201d and it is broadcast, around the globe, at a moment of ecstatic, international triumph.DeBord, who spent 16 years on Broadway as a conductor and pianist, is on the faculty at the University of Michigan\u2019s department of musical theater. He is the first to admit that few people are likely to notice, let alone be bothered by, the elements of the song that annoy him. But when he posted his feelings on his Facebook page, he quickly found that he had company. Lots of perturbed company.\u201cGlad it\u2019s not just me,\u201d one commenter wrote.Another person posted: \u201cSounds like a music school project gone awry. Just awful.\u201d16 Photos\u201cI\u2019m not on Twitter,\u201d someone else added, \u201cbut there must be a way to tell \u2018them\u2019!!!\u201dAsked for the particulars of his beef with this \u201cBanner,\u201d DeBord offered to head to the piano in his home and provide a live tutorial, over the phone. He quickly plowed through the beginning of the song \u2014 \u201cO say, can you see, by the dawn\u2019s early light\u201d \u2014 but stopped when he got to \u201cWhat so proudly we hailed.\u201dAt \u201cproudly,\u201d he noted, the Olympic version of the anthem goes to one of those sad, dark minor chords where majors have long been the norm. He played the standard version and then the Olympic version \u2014 standard, Olympic, over and over. Once he pointed out the difference, it was obvious. The Olympic version was conciliatory, maybe even retreating. The standard version was chest-thumping and on the offense.\u201cIt happens again on \u2018rockets\u2019 red glare,\u2019\u201d he said, hands on the piano, \u201cand then again on \u2018land of the free.\u2019\u201dThere is no official or definitive version of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner,\u201d and that is no accident. The 1931 bill signed into law by President Herbert Hoover that adopted the song as the nation\u2019s anthem is a model of terseness. It is mum about both lyrics and arrangement, which, said Mark Clague, an associate professor of musicology at the University of Michigan, is one reason the anthem has continued to evolve over the years.\u201cWhen Francis Scott Key wrote it, he\u2019d just seen a decisive victory in Baltimore in the War of 1812, which was like a second war of independence,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cHe writes the song in celebration, and it\u2019s played for years with a celebratory feel, up-tempo and light. Only later does it become the song we know, slower and more majestic.\u201dClague, who is working on a book about \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner,\u201d did indeed notice the new Olympic take on the song. What struck him most was the way it handled the climactic \u201cland of the free,\u201d which is typically wrung for maximum emotion.\u201cHere it goes to a minor chord,\u201d he said, \u201cso rather than having that firm, confident expression of the word \u2018free,\u2019 you get an unstable, questioning chord. Where you should be feeling victory, you have a question mark.\u201dClague sounds less bothered by this take on the anthem. Maybe it is because he knows thousands of versions have been created over the years and he regards the tune as a variety of clay that everyone is free to mold. He also surmises that the arranger was adapting the song for the moment.\u201cWhen we play the anthem in the U.S., it\u2019s often all about creating a sense of unity in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Olympics is a very different context. We\u2019re really celebrating brotherhood, international cooperation, rather than martial qualities that anthems are often called upon to express. Three flags are being raised, not one. So I think that what has happened here is they\u2019ve softened the song, de-emphasizing the militant aspect and emphasizing the song\u2019s lyrical side, to bring out the community-of-nations idea.\u201dThe United States Olympic Committee said it was not responsible for submitting the anthem to Olympic organizers. The group that is running the Rio Games said it would look into the origin of the United States anthem being played here.This version may not be making its Olympic debut. According to DeBord and Clague, the version heard here in Rio was also used at the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, and the 2012 Summer Games in London. Those were in the key of C major and were 70 seconds long.During a medal ceremony, Shazam, the song identification app, tagged the track as \u201cThe London Philharmonic Orchestra & Philip Sheppard.\u201dIf this rendition originated in London, where did London get it?That project was led by Sheppard, a British composer, cellist and professor at the Royal Academy of Music whose website states that he has scored more than 30 films and worked with David Bowie, Jeff Buckley, the Weeknd and many other recording artists. In the video, he is seen conducting the London Philharmonic Orchestra at Abbey Road, the studio made famous by the Beatles.Sheppard could not be reached Wednesday.\u201cThe anthems serve a particular purpose at the Olympics,\u201d he tells an off-screen interviewer in the video. \u201cThat is namely to get the flag up the pole during the gold medal ceremonies.\u201dHe is making the practical point that the songs cannot go on and on. So one of his biggest challenges, he said, was ensuring that each anthem lasted 60 to 90 seconds. This meant dramatic cuts for some anthems \u2014 like Uruguay\u2019s, which usually lasts for six and a half minutes \u2014 and looping repetition for others, like Uganda\u2019s, which is only nine bars long.All the countries had to sign off on the new arrangements, Sheppard says. At one moment in the video, he sounds a little nervous about whether Britain will give a thumbs-up.The video ends, inexplicably, with the full, 70-second rendering of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d as the camera shows an American flag. There is no commentary.Is it possible that Sheppard went with minor chords as a way to shave time off the tune? The standard \u201cland of the free,\u201d for instance, when milked properly, takes its time.DeBord doubts it. But for him, the need for edits could never justify such maddening results.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to compromise a piece of music,\u201d he said, \u201cto make it work for time.\u201dTeresa Cotsirilos contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

When she signed up for a citizens academy held by the local police department, she and her husband were among 35 people hoping to learn more about law enforcement tactics.During the training on Tuesday, which drew community leaders, business employees and even the chief of the Punta Gorda Police Department, Ms. Knowlton was selected to participate in a \u201cshoot/don\u2019t shoot\u201d role-play exercise. But the session went terribly wrong.Ms. Knowlton, 73, was accidentally shot and killed by a police officer, according to the authorities.The police chief, Thomas P. Lewis, said at a news conference on Wednesday that Ms. Knowlton had been killed by an officer who fired a revolver that had been used before in the role-play exercise intended to teach people how to make decisions when confronted with lethal force.The chief, who said he had been present at the time of the shooting, did not address why the officer, whom the department later identified as Officer Lee Coel, used live rounds in the training session.On Wednesday, the Police Department said in a statement that Officer Coel joined the department in 2014 and frequently participated in shoot/don\u2019t shoot programs. Chief Lewis said that Officer Coel was placed on administrative leave and that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement would conduct an independent investigation.\u201cThe Police Department is always open to criticism. Bottom line is we don\u2019t always get it right,\u201d the chief said at the time.Police departments across the United States, from Houston to Evanston, Ill., host some version of citizens academy programs for volunteers. Curriculums range from how to reach out to at-risks youth to shoot/don\u2019t shoot scenarios, which are often meant to show members of the public what police officers face when they confront an armed suspect, and which factors lead to the decision to fire their weapons.\u201cThis type of scenario-based role play is not only well received in our community, but has grown in use across the country,\u201d Lt. Katie R. Heck of the Punta Gorda Police Department, said in a statement on Wednesday. The department had operated the scenarios as part of its training program for about two years without incident, Lieutenant Heck said in an email.A CNN report in May showed an anchor, Carol Costello, undergoing a shoot/don\u2019t shoot training session developed by F.B.I. agents. Ms. Costello was outfitted with a heart monitor and given a firearm. She was told to negotiate with a man portraying an emotionally disturbed person who later pulls out a weapon.Ms. Costello hesitates to pull her gun, and another man standing next to her says, \u201cO.K., bam, you\u2019re dead.\u201dIn Punta Gorda, Ms. Knowlton was chosen at random with another person to participate in a session. She was shot during the first of two planned scenarios, the police said.In a statement on Wednesday, Howard Kunik, the city manager, also called the shooting a \u201chorrific accident.\u201d He said that the Police Department\u2019s chaplain had been made available to assist the program\u2019s other attendees.Calls to a phone number listed for the Knowlton family were not immediately returned on Wednesday, but Katie Mazzi, a friend and fellow member of the Friends of the Punta Gorda Library organization, said Ms. Knowlton and her husband, Gary, had moved to Punta Gorda, a harbor town of about 16,000 people near Fort Myers, about 15 years ago.Ms. Mazzi said that the Knowltons were involved in several local philanthropic organizations and their church, and helped mentor at-risk youths.Of the news media attention surrounding the case, Ms. Mazzi, 66, said: \u201cIt\u2019s resonating because of the horrific nature of what happened. But for us in the community, the bigger story is that it was Mary.\u201d\u201cIn that situation, why wasn\u2019t somebody else \u2014 you know, another cop \u2014 playing that role?\u201d he said. \u201cWhy was anybody even aiming a gun at anybody?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "John McLaughlin, TV Host Who Made Combat of Punditry, Dies at 89", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "Supported byJohn McLaughlin, a former Roman Catholic priest who became an aide to Richard M. Nixon in the White House and parlayed his fierce defense of the president into a television career as host of \u201cThe McLaughlin Group,\u201d the long-running Sunday morning program of combative political punditry, died on Tuesday at his home in Washington. He was 89.Mr. McLaughlin had been absent from the show this last weekend for the first time in more than 34 years. \u201cI am under the weather,\u201d he wrote to viewers in a note that began the broadcast, adding that his voice was \u201cweaker than usual\u201d but that his \u201cspirit is strong.\u201dAs creator, executive producer and host of \u201cThe McLaughlin Group,\u201d which began in 1982, Mr. McLaughlin helped reinvent the political talk-show format by injecting unabashed partisanship and a dash of entertainment.His program, broadcast on select CBS and PBS stations, inspired a generation of pundits, although few quite adopted his self-exaggerated, blustery persona. His penchant for giving nicknames to his panelists, his riffling through the week\u2019s topics and his prosecutorial questioning became fodder for comedians, notably Dana Carvey on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d even while policy makers tuned in for the political observations.The show always ended with a prediction by each of the panelists, with Mr. McLaughlin getting the final word, even if seemingly with tongue in cheek. In 1989, for example, he predicted, \u201cWithin weeks, Delaware will authorize public flogging for drug trafficking.\u2019\u2019 (It did not.) His trademark signoff was a robust \u201cBye-bye!\u201dMr. McLaughlin, who left the priesthood in 1975, \u201cproved that you could be provocative and an advocate and entertaining, and bring a larger audience to public affairs programming,\u201d said Tammy Haddad, a former vice president of political coverage for MSNBC. Ms. Haddad was also an executive producer of \u201cHardball With Chris Matthews,\u201d whose host got ample exposure on Mr. McLaughlin\u2019s weekly round table earlier in his career.\u201cThe early success of CNN,\u201d Ms. Haddad noted, was based on its \u201cpolitical food fights\u201d by the likes of Robert Novak and Patrick J. Buchanan, both of whom were founding \u201cMcLaughlin Group\u201d panelists.While in the White House, Mr. McLaughlin, well-informed but prone to tirades, would \u201csometimes almost become a cartoon of himself\u201d when reporters called, said Bob Schieffer, the CBS News Washington reporter who became host of the CBS Sunday show \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d But as a talk-show host, Mr. Schieffer said, Mr. McLaughlin changed the industry with his shouting.Combativeness was part of Mr. McLaughlin\u2019s style from the beginning. As a Jesuit priest, he had been in frequent conflict with his superiors, who disapproved of his 1970 run for the United States Senate in Rhode Island as a Republican calling for a rapid end to the Vietnam War. Father McLaughlin, who had resigned as an editor at the Jesuit magazine America and switched his party affiliation, was believed to be the first active Roman Catholic priest to run for the Senate.He stood in sharp contrast to his fellow Jesuit Robert Drinan of Massachusetts, who was given permission to run for the House that same year as an antiwar Democrat. Father McLaughlin, who was chastised by the bishop of Providence, R.I., for his Senate run, lost by a wide margin to the incumbent Democrat, John O. Pastore.Father McLaughlin went to Washington anyway, joining President Nixon\u2019s speechwriting team in 1971. Nicknamed Nixon\u2019s Priest, he gave frequent speeches in defense of the president\u2019s conduct of the Vietnam War, including bombing missions into Cambodia.As the Watergate crisis deepened, Father McLaughlin became one of the president\u2019s most visible supporters. At one news conference, he dismissed Nixon\u2019s use of profanity as \u201cemotional drainage.\u201d Less than two weeks before the president resigned, Father McLaughlin warned in a speech at the National Press Club that the nation would face a \u201cparade of horrors\u201d should Nixon be impeached. (On July 31, 1973, Father Drinan became the first congressman to call for impeachment in a House resolution.)After Vice President Gerald R. Ford succeeded Nixon in August 1974, Father McLaughlin\u2019s speechwriting position was abolished.Father McLaughlin had maintained a high profile in Washington, living at the tony Watergate complex rather than in the austere Jesuit residence at Georgetown University where Father Drinan lived. This led his church superiors to rebuke him in May 1974, summoning him to a period of \u201creflection.\u201dInstead, in 1975, Mr. McLaughlin successfully petitioned Pope Paul VI and was released from his vows.John Joseph McLaughlin was born in Providence on March 29, 1927, to the former Eva Turcotte and Augustus H. McLaughlin, a regional salesman for a furniture company. After graduating from LaSalle Academy in Providence and studying for the priesthood in Massachusetts, he was ordained a priest in 1959.He earned master\u2019s degrees in philosophy and English literature from Boston College, and a doctorate in philosophy from Columbia University. He then taught at the Jesuit-run Fairfield College Preparatory School in Connecticut.After leaving the White House, he and his wife at the time, Ms. Dore, founded a media relations and public affairs consulting company. In the early 1980s, Mr. McLaughlin hosted a weekend talk program on the Washington radio station WRC. After joining the magazine National Review as the Washington editor and a columnist, he founded a television production concern with the backing of former Nixon allies and persuaded NBC\u2019s Washington television affiliate, WRC-TV, to broadcast a new type of weekend political talk show and to let him host it.At the time, TV round tables of journalists like \u201cAgronsky & Company\u201d and \u201cWashington Week in Review\u201d dissected the week\u2019s developments in a sober, nonpartisan style. Mr. McLaughlin envisioned a more animated, argumentative format including a panel reflecting conservative, moderate and liberal views, with him as moderator.From its debut in 1982 \u201cThe McLaughlin Group\u201d took on the flavor of a barroom debate, pitting a largely white, male cadre of columnists and political insiders against one another as they gave vent to views from the hard right (Mr. Novak and Mr. Buchanan) to the center-left (Morton Kondracke of The New Republic and Jack Germond of The Baltimore Sun). Ms. Clift, a Newsweek correspondent at the time, and the Chicago Tribune columnist Clarence Page, who is black, later joined the group as more liberal regulars.Regardless of the panelists\u2019 political persuasions, Mr. McLaughlin, whose own politics leaned decidedly right, would often fire off questions and cut them off, shouting \u201cWronnnng!\u201dWhen the cameras were off, the panelists often feuded. Mr. Novak left after a falling out in 1988 and founded a similar program on CNN, \u201cCapital Gang.\u201d In an interview on PBS in June 2007, Mr. Novak said of Mr. McLaughlin, \u201cHe may not be pure evil, but he\u2019s close to it.\u201d Mr. Germond, another of the original panelists, called the show \u201creally bad TV,\u201d and said he had stayed on only because he needed the money to pay his daughter\u2019s medical school tuition.Mr. McLaughlin was also the executive producer and host of \u201cJohn McLaughlin\u2019s One on One,\u201d a weekly interview program that was broadcast on NBC and PBS stations. From 1989 to 1994 he hosted a daily interview show on CNBC.An obituary on Wednesday about John McLaughlin, the host of the long-running television talk show \u201cThe McLaughlin Group,\u201d referred incorrectly to the magazine National Review, where he worked in the 1980s. It is published biweekly, not weekly. The obituary also misstated the length of Mr. McLaughlin\u2019s tenure there. He remained at National Review for a number of years after \u201cThe McLaughlin Group\u201d made its debut in 1982; he did not begin the program \u201cafter a stint\u201d at the magazine. Because of an editing error, the obituary also misstated the year Mr. McLaughlin was ordained a priest. It was 1959, not 1947.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thailand Junta Seeks to Extend Its Power With Constitutional Referendum", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBANGKOK \u2014 Two years after seizing power, Thailand\u2019s military junta will hold a national referendum Sunday on a new constitution that it casts as an essential step toward restoring democracy.But the junta has blocked opponents from campaigning against the measure, banned election monitors and restricted news coverage of the referendum. And the proposed constitution, critics say, would weaken the role of elected officials and extend the military\u2019s influence for years to come.The vote will be the first major test of the military\u2019s standing with the public, as much a referendum on the legitimacy of military rule as on the draft constitution. But no matter the outcome, the junta will remain in control until it decides to hand power back to an elected government.For Thailand, which changes constitutions more often than the United States changes presidents, the proposed charter is not necessarily expected to endure. But it seeks to reduce the influence of any one politician or party, a measure that seems particularly directed at populist leaders who appeal to the poorer rural population of northern Thailand.\u201cThe idea is to craft the rules and the institutions to rebalance power and authority from the previous decade,\u201d said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political-science professor at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok. \u201cThe goal is to keep the political party system fragmented to bring about a fragile coalition government that will not be dominated by a single party.\u201dThe junta, which has portrayed itself as the only institution capable of maintaining stability in the bitterly divided country, says that by minimizing the influence of any party, the new political structure would help prevent corruption and bring fairness to government.But if the aim is democracy, the means are hardly reassuring.At least 120 opponents of the proposed constitution have been arrested on suspicion of distributing false information about the measure, which carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison, or of violating other campaign restrictions, including a ban on assemblies of more than five people, said Sunai Phasuk, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch.\u201cThis referendum is not legitimate,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a redo of a military coup, using fear and intimidation to force Thai people to grant an extension of their control of power.\u201dThe military has defended the restrictions on opposition campaigning, as well as the banning of party election monitors and the arrest and office search of a journalist who was covering opposition activists.Panitan Wattanayagorn, an adviser to Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha, the junta chief and prime minister, said the public did not need an election campaign that could lead to more strife. Voters can decide by studying the 105-page document, he said.\u201cThe government is asking people to read the 279 articles themselves and use their own judgment and go vote on Aug. 7,\u201d he said in an interview.The yellow shirts, including royalists and middle-class urbanites in southern Thailand, have long opposed the siblings\u2019 populist rule.The military\u2019s strategy is to reduce the influence of her party by increasing the power of other parties and the military.Those changes would increase the representation of medium-size parties and virtually assure that no party could win a majority or govern without forming a coalition.\u201cThe section on the parliamentary system is quite new in many regards,\u201d said Mr. Panitan, the junta adviser. \u201cIt\u2019s an attempt to control and regulate the politicians.\u201dA companion ballot measure would give the junta the authority to appoint all 250 Senate members, who would serve five-year terms. The Senate would join the lower house in selecting the prime minister, giving the military influence over the government long after the junta is dissolved.Critics say these measures will weaken political parties, but at the expense of democracy.Professor Thitinan said red- shirts and some yellow shirts might reject the proposed constitution because of dissatisfaction with years of military rule.Either way, he notes, the military will remain in power for the foreseeable future. Rejection of the referendum would give the junta a chance to try again with a new proposal.For that reason, some voters say they will stay away from the polls.\u201cVoting would be considered accepting this rule, but I don\u2019t accept this rule,\u201d said Thanee Keawwanna, 46, a tile company supervisor in Chiang Mai Province. \u201cIf the no-vote wins, we will be asking, what responsibility will the junta take? Will they quit?\u201dMr. Panitan said the junta planned to hold elections in 2017 regardless of the outcome on Sunday, although the elections could take place later in the year if the proposed constitution was rejected.At that point, he said, General Prayuth will step down.\u201cThe prime minister has already decided the elections will happen,\u201d Mr. Panitan said. \u201cFor the prime minister, his service is almost done.\u201dSome voters, eager to see the country move on, said that was reason enough to support the proposal.\u201cI will vote to accept it as we need to have a constitution,\u201d said Supop Promminlat, 44, a rice farmer in Chiang Mai Province. \u201cWe have to have rule of law. If we do not accept it, we will be living in this situation for a long time.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Oracle will also have data on what customers do after an ad campaign, so advertisers can check the outcome of a Google ad blitz.The same data-heavy approach can be used in functions of business like procurement, human capital management, sales and service, Mr. Kurian thinks. \u201cWe know how payrolls change around job titles, the rate of salary changes in Silicon Valley versus Bangalore, or how many people in a company are buying a $10 printer cartridge,\u201d he told me in an earlier interview.This data analysis could become a valuable adjunct to many of Oracle\u2019s database and applications businesses. Equally, it drives home how the competition in cloud computing is moving from cost savings \u2014 Amazon Web Services started by selling cheap computing and storage \u2014 to value creation through better insight.In that business, large amounts of data are a critical asset \u2014 what Mr. Kurian termed \u201ctrying to be at the center of data gravity.\u201d Oracle definitely has a place there, perhaps a better one than any company.Other elements of success will most likely include reliability, ease of use and price. Oracle may be challenged there, precisely because it has built a big and complicated system of databases, bigger than anything Amazon, Microsoft or Google sells. It has to keep those older customers happy, even as it makes data easier to move around, in and out of the cloud, for different kinds of analysis.In that, Oracle has a powerful and little-noted asset: Despite its reputation as a hard-edge company, it has good engineers with decades of experience. Employees fly in and out of Google or Facebook, but they seem to stay longer, on average, at Oracle.That can be an advantage when it comes to working on complex projects. \u201cUnderstanding complex software takes a year,\u201d Mr. Kurian said. \u201cUnderstanding the intentions behind it, which you need if you\u2019re going to adapt it, takes even longer.\u201dSlow, steady and reliable may make people at the fast, young tech companies snicker.

Too bad he\u2019d rather be playing basketball.Supported byThey were playing the game, laughing and talking excitedly, as they arrived at the practice court. Kyrgios, who recently reached a career-high ranking of No. 16 in the world, took a seat, put down the phones, opened his bag and pulled out a racket. \u201cIt\u2019s important to find a balance between Pok\u00e9mon and training,\u201d he said, with only the faintest hint of sarcasm.Browning eyed the racket for a moment, then asked, \u201cWhat strings do you use?\u201d Kyrgios said they were supplied by his racket manufacturer, Yonex. So what did he do when all of his strings broke? \u201cThen I don\u2019t practice till I get to the next tournament,\u201d Kyrgios replied. I laughed, but Browning seemed to take this answer seriously, and Kyrgios gave no indication that he was joking. Maybe he wasn\u2019t. When I asked Kyrgios what size racket head he used, he shrugged and said, \u201cNo idea.\u201dHis girlfriend, a Croatian-born player named Ajla Tomljanovic, was out on the court, hitting with her father; the family dog ran between them, furiously trying to intercept the ball. Tomljanovic, who is two years older than Kyrgios and applied for Australian citizenship last year, didn\u2019t appear to mind sharing her boyfriend\u2019s attention with Browning, Williams and Pok\u00e9mon \u2014 although later in the day, at a photo shoot in West Palm Beach, she expressed some mild exasperation when Kyrgios, summoned to the wardrobe room, implored her to take over his game. \u201cI\u2019m not playing Pok\u00e9mon with your 7-year-old friend,\u201d she said. Kyrgios quickly corrected her, albeit incorrectly: \u201cHe\u2019s 10, not 7.\u201dKyrgios would be leaving the next day for Toronto, to play in his first tournament since Wimbledon. He had an eventful Wimbledon this year. On the plus side, he won three tough matches and left fans and commentators swooning over his flashy play \u2014 particularly a between-the-legs lob against his first-round opponent, the crafty veteran Radek Stepanek, which might have been the shot of the fortnight. With his bullying serve, haymaker forehand and knack for carnivalesque shots, Kyrgios is wildly entertaining to watch. Pretty much everyone around the game agrees that he has the talent to reach No. 1 and win a fistful of majors.In his postmatch press conference, Kyrgios was somber and uncharacteristically self-critical. \u201cI think when things get tough, I\u2019m just a little bit soft,\u201d he said. Soon enough, though, he was back to his normal pugnacious self. Kyrgios is notorious for his Twitter spats, and when he saw a series of caustic tweets from the British media figure Piers Morgan \u2014 calling him, among other things, a \u201cpetulant little brat\u201d \u2014 Kyrgios couldn\u2019t let the insults go unanswered. (\u201cEAD,\u201d he replied; the E is for \u201ceat,\u201d and you can look the rest up.)The Murray match wasn\u2019t Kyrgios\u2019s lowest moment. That remains the incident in Montreal last summer, when he told the Swiss star Stan Wawrinka between points that his girlfriend had slept with another player. (Kyrgios later apologized.) Still, his desultory Wimbledon performance left the tennis world scratching its head. Before the tournament, there was much talk about Kyrgios\u2019s need for a coach; he\u2019d been without one for more than a year. Afterward, some observers, including Murray, gently suggested that perhaps what Kyrgios needed even more than a coach was a psychologist.People around the game have trouble believing Kyrgios is really as down on tennis as he claims; they figure the ambivalence is just his way of deflecting pressure. The expectations for him are huge, and not just because he is so talented. Tennis is approaching a period of transition. Federer just turned 35, a step closer to retirement. The Williams sisters are in their mid-30s. Kyrgios, with his billboard looks and outsize personality, is seen as the one emerging star who can attract new fans and keep old ones from drifting away. (He\u2019s terrific with fans \u2014 funny, charming and unusually generous with his time, even working the crowd during matches.) His agents are convinced he could become the sport\u2019s most bankable star yet. Justin Gimelstob, a former player now working as an analyst for the Tennis Channel, put it succinctly when I asked him about Kyrgios: \u201cHe\u2019s box office.\u201dLately, however, men\u2019s tennis isn\u2019t turning out stormy souls as reliably as it did in the past. With a few exceptions, the players behave impeccably, on the court and off; they exude equanimity and seriousness of purpose and are careful not to say anything offensive. A surfeit of gentlemen is far from the worst fate to befall a sport, and complaining about it might seem obscenely small-minded coming at the end of the most spectacular era that the men\u2019s game has ever seen \u2014 Federer with a record 17 Grand Slam singles titles; Nadal, 14; Djokovic, 12, the three combining to win 43 of the last 53 majors. Still: Even off-the-charts greatness can get a little tedious, and the fact is that fans, especially casual ones, are drawn to firebrands and eccentrics. Tennis was perhaps never more popular than when McEnroe and Connors were scandalizing the sport\u2019s old guard. Even Federer, a beacon of Old World graciousness, has bemoaned the current shortage of salty characters, complaining that players are now \u201calmost too nice to each other.\u201dWhy did men\u2019s tennis become so much tamer? Money is surely part of it. Tennis is much more lucrative than it was 30 years ago, and the players tend to think of themselves as precious brands \u2014 the Wimbledon finalist Milos Raonic describes himself without irony as the \u201cC.E.O. of Milos Raonic Tennis.\u201d When Agassi pitched Canon cameras by declaring that \u201cimage is everything,\u201d the line was celebrating his own iconoclasm (the denim shorts, the blond rattail); today\u2019s players agree with the sentiment but prefer an image that\u2019s likable, decorous and safe. One paradox of tennis is that what\u2019s good for the sport \u2014 clashes, controversies and divisive figures \u2014 can be bad for individual players\u2019 bottom lines. I suspect the gentility also has something to do with how the game itself has evolved over the last quarter-century: What used to be a battle of finesse and guile is increasingly a test of strength and endurance, full of three-hour matches and 20-shot rallies. It\u2019s so demanding, physically and mentally, that keeping emotions in check and avoiding distractions is a necessary survival strategy.Kyrgios\u2019s refusal to submit to convention is a refreshing departure from all this. It says a lot about his talent that he has managed to break into the top 20 while spurning the standard recipe for success \u2014 even basics like having a coach. But the maverick act can wear thin. What made players like McEnroe and Connors such intriguing figures was that amid all the meshugas, they rose to the pinnacle of the sport. If they hadn\u2019t won majors, hadn\u2019t reached No. 1, they would have become cautionary tales, not legends. The question for Kyrgios is whether he can achieve similar success without changing his approach and becoming more committed. That seems unlikely, as even he implicitly acknowledged when we spoke. Because he was his own coach, I asked what advice he would give himself if he wanted to win majors. He thought about it for a moment, then said: \u201cTrain more than four times a week.\u201d After a pause, he continued. \u201cI don\u2019t have a doubt that if I wanted to win Grand Slams, I would commit,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d train two times a day, I\u2019d go to the gym every day, I\u2019d stretch, I\u2019d do rehab, I\u2019d eat right. But I don\u2019t know what I want at the moment. Am I content? I don\u2019t have a coach, I can train every now and then. I can take it easy and be maybe 10-20 my entire career. Am I O.K. with that? I don\u2019t know.\u201dNick was the last of three children born to Giorgos and Norlaila Kyrgios. Giorgos immigrated to Australia from Greece as a child and works as a house painter; Norlaila was born in Malaysia and moved to Australia with her mother when she was 12. Neither played much tennis, but all three of their children took up the sport. Kyrgios says his parents pushed him to choose tennis over basketball when he was 14, but they were not pushy \u201ctennis parents\u201d; by all accounts, they were low-key and quite gracious. Kyrgios himself was said to have been a bit spoiled, indulged in the way that babies of the family often are. Still, in the tight-knit Canberra tennis community, he was generally well regarded, as were his parents.He was overweight from a young age. He told me he didn\u2019t have a poor diet as a kid, although his grandmother often treated him to Kentucky Fried Chicken after school; he just ate a lot. The weight made him slow and limited his endurance. It was his effort to find a way around these liabilities that helped turn him into the player we see today. To compensate for his lack of speed, he learned to read the game better than other kids, to know where an opponent\u2019s shot was likely to land before the ball was even struck. And because he needed to end points before his stamina flagged, he developed the first-strike, attacking style that is the hallmark of his game. Somehow, he managed to do all this while resisting the rote drilling that is the bedrock of tennis training. From the start, he had no patience for that kind of practicing; he just wanted to play, and he was so competitive that if no one was keeping score, he wasn\u2019t interested. That is still the case.In 2011, at 16, Kyrgios played with the Australian squad at a Junior Davis Cup tournament in Mexico. Pat Cash, a former Wimbledon champion, was the captain of the team. When Cash and I spoke in the players\u2019 lounge at Wimbledon this year, he told me he\u2019d been struck by the racket speed that Kyrgios generated: \u201cHis arm was so fast, it was like he was playing with a toothpick.\u201d He was also blown away by Kyrgios\u2019s rare combination of power and control. Cash played against a 14-year-old Nadal, and what he saw in Mexico convinced him that Kyrgios was every bit as promising.There were some red flags, though. Cash took the players out for dinner one night and watched Kyrgios inhale two massive burritos \u2014 \u201cthe biggest things you\u2019ve ever seen, must have been 4,000 calories\u201d \u2014 which made him wonder if Kyrgios would ever lose his paunch. Kyrgios was also prone to inexplicable meltdowns and moments of rebellion. During one match, he was crushing a player from Argentina when he suddenly came unhinged, shouting, \u201cI can\u2019t play, I have no rhythm,\u201d before throwing away the second set. On the night before the semifinals, Cash was horrified to discover that Kyrgios, despite nursing a strained muscle, organized a football-throwing competition with teammates on a nearby field. \u201cHe was the ringleader, the cheeky one, the one with the jokes,\u201d Cash told me.Despite the high jinks, histrionics and burritos, Cash came away convinced that Kyrgios was special. At the end of the tournament, he took him aside and said: \u201cNick, no offense to these other guys, but you are unbelievably talented. You can make it. You can be holding the big trophies.\u201d Fifteen months later, Kyrgios, who had finally experienced a growth spurt and was slimming down, won the Junior Australian Open boys\u2019 singles title. The victory instantly marked him as a great hope for Australian tennis \u2014 no easy role. Australia is a sports-crazed nation, and because it has turned out so many celebrated players (Rod Laver, Roy Emerson, Ken Rosewall, Margaret Smith Court, Evonne Goolagong Cawley, Pat Cash, Patrick Rafter, the list goes on), tennis is central to its sporting identity. These players weren\u2019t just great champions, either; they embodied a culture and an ethos. They were plain-spoken, no-fuss athletes, tenacious competitors but also paragons of good cheer and sportsmanship.Kyrgios is the prodigal heir to this tradition. With his brash manner and flamboyant personal style \u2014 showy haircut, sculpted eyebrows, gold chains \u2014 he seems more American than Australian, and his misbehavior and occasional lack of effort infuriate many of his compatriots. At this point, hand-wringing about Kyrgios has become a popular Australian pastime. Last year, the cricket legend Shane Warne posted an open letter to Kyrgios on Facebook, saying, \u201cYou\u2019re testing our patience, mate,\u201d and urging him to shape up. After Kyrgios was fined $1,500 for shouting an obscenity at a tournament last fall in Shanghai, the Australian-rules football star Taylor (Tex) Walker blasted him on Twitter: \u201cWhen is this absolute galoot going to learn. What a dead set flog!!\u201dKyrgios has reason for hard feelings, too. Some of the criticism he has received can take on racial undertones. There was unmistakable nativism at play when the former Olympic champion swimmer Dawn Fraser said last year that if Kyrgios and the fellow tennis bad boy Bernard Tomic, whose parents are from the former Yugoslavia, didn\u2019t improve their behavior, they should \u201cgo back to where their fathers and parents came from. We don\u2019t need them here in this country.\u201d (She later apologized.) The two came under fire again in May, this time from the chef de mission of the Australian Olympic team, a former pentathlete named Kitty Chiller, who warned that if they didn\u2019t curb their antics, they could be kept home from the Rio Games. Her decision to put the players on public notice struck even people not normally sympathetic to Kyrgios as needlessly confrontational. Tomic immediately announced that he would be skipping Rio; Kyrgios followed suit a few weeks later. Although they had a headline-making spat earlier this year, after Tomic suggested that Kyrgios faked illness to get out of a Davis Cup match, the two players are good friends and enjoy the kind of spirited relationship you would expect of guys in their early 20s with multimillion-dollar bank accounts \u2014 like the time Kyrgios, along with a few other players, toilet-papered Tomic\u2019s Lamborghini.Two days after I saw him in Florida, Kyrgios lost his first-round match in Toronto to a Canadian teenager ranked No. 370 in the world. Before the match, Kyrgios tweeted: \u201cEat, Sleep, Pok\u00e9mon GO,\u201d and he evidently still had Squirtles and Venusaurs on the brain when he took the court; he served an appalling 18 double faults, 10 more than Murray coughed up over the course of two weeks and seven matches at Wimbledon. In a press conference, he pointed out the enthusiastic backing his opponent received and took a swipe at his own countrymen: \u201cI think Canadians support their athletes a little better than the Australians do,\u201d he said.To hear Fleming tell it, Kyrgios\u2019s supposed vices were actually virtues. His combustive personality might rankle tennis traditionalists and some members of the media, but it was a boon for the sport. \u201cHe\u2019s unscripted, he can bring in casual fans \u2014 he\u2019s one of the few athletes who can do that,\u201d Fleming said. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely refreshing.\u201d He went on to say that Kyrgios, a product and exemplar of what he called \u201cmodern urban youth culture,\u201d could unlock all sorts of unprecedented opportunities for himself and, by extension, for tennis. He cited Kyrgios\u2019s endorsement deal with Beats by Dre and also told me that the N.B.A. had expressed interest in working with him on cross-promotional activities. To Fleming, Kyrgios had the potential to become a trendsetter and marketing phenom beyond anything tennis has seen. But he quickly added a qualifier: \u201cWinning is the first thing.\u201dAnd despite all the distractions and all the ambivalence, Kyrgios has done a lot of winning. In the last two years, he has notched victories over Nadal, Federer and Murray. In February, he won his first A.T.P. title in Marseilles, and he won his second earlier this month in Atlanta. His forehand \u2014 heavy, sharply angled \u2014 is spoken of with awe by his peers, but his serve may be an even bigger weapon, because of both the pace he generates (as high as 130 miles an hour on his first serve; when the racket strikes, it sounds like a tree limb snapping) and his ability to place the ball. He plays very fast, and when he is serving well, he closes out games in barely a minute. He faced Raonic in the quarterfinals of a tournament in Miami in March, and over the course of four service games in the second set, he surrendered just one point. It\u2019s the kind of efficiency that invites comparisons to Federer and Pete Sampras, who held the record for major titles until Federer eclipsed him.But Kyrgios is still a raw talent, and if he wants to break into the top 10 and contend for majors, he\u2019ll probably need a coach. He has found a mentor of sorts in Radek Stepanek, who is basically his antithesis \u2014 a 37-year-old tennis lifer who adores the game and plans to keep playing until his body gives out. When I talked to Stepanek the day after the two faced off at Wimbledon, he said that they\u2019d struck up a friendship after practicing together in Miami, and that he had offered Kyrgios some general suggestions, along with tips for playing specific opponents. But the first thing they talked about, he said, was attitude: \u201cI told him, \u2018If you don\u2019t want to be here, then you should go home.\u2019\u2009\u201d Stepanek said that he was happy to contribute what he could to Kyrgios\u2019s development, but he had no interest in becoming a full-time coach; he was busy with his own career.A number of people have expressed interest in coaching Kyrgios, but others wonder whether it would just be wasted effort. \u201cYou have to be willing to listen, and you have to have some respect,\u201d Pat Cash says. \u201cHis behavior toward a lot of people shows that he may not be good at either of those things.\u201d His second match at Wimbledon \u2014 against Dustin Brown, a dreadlocked Jamaican-German renowned for his shotmaking prowess \u2014 illustrated the challenge a coach would face. Kyrgios was the better player, but it was clear from the start that he had no intention of ceding the highlight reel to Brown; he was determined to match him, crazy shot for crazy shot. The first set was tennis\u2019s version of slam-dunk contest, a showboating extravaganza. A coach would have implored Kyrgios to stick with plain vanilla tennis, but it\u2019s doubtful he would have listened. As Kyrgios told me, \u201cI like to hit fun shots.\u201d He ended up beating Brown in five sets, but his lack of discipline made the match far more difficult than it might otherwise have been.Could the \u201cfun shots\u201d be Kyrgios\u2019s way of finding pleasure in a sport that he says doesn\u2019t offer him a lot of fulfillment? It\u2019s possible that the ambivalence he expresses about tennis really is his way of deflecting pressure, or that he does it just to get a rise out of people; he\u2019s only 21, and his game has matured much faster than he has. But maybe, when he says that he doesn\u2019t love tennis, he is telling the truth. It wouldn\u2019t necessarily doom his career: Agassi reached No. 1 and claimed eight major titles even though he spent much of his life hating tennis. John Morris told me Kyrgios is so competitive \u2014 they play I Spy on car trips, and Kyrgios goes bonkers if he doesn\u2019t win \u2014 that he might end up atop the sport in spite of how he feels about it. For now, he remains one of those players who gratify and torment tennis fans in equal measure. Some athletes spend their careers thrilling us, others spend their careers frustrating us and some do both. Maybe Kyrgios is destined to be one of those.That Saturday in Boca, though, recharged by a recent visit home and together with his girlfriend, Kyrgios seemed content to be on the tennis court. He was practicing with a pair of 17-year-old Americans, Gianni Ross and Sam Riffice, in a typical Kyrgios practice session: He just wanted to play points, while keeping up a running commentary for his audience, a group that included me, Ross\u2019s parents, Tomljanovic\u2019s father, a couple of teenage girls who were apparently there to ogle and Robbye Poole, Serena Williams\u2019s hitting partner, who happened to be at the academy that day. His Pok\u00e9mon buddy Tauheed Browning was perched by the fence on Kyrgios\u2019s side of the court. At one point, I overheard Kyrgios jokingly upbraiding him, saying, \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be my coach!\u201dAfter maybe 30 minutes, Kyrgios decided it was time to kick back. He summoned Browning, Langston Williams and Poole to join in for some Touch Tennis, a game in which players stand close to the net and hit delicate flick shots back and forth until someone misses. Browning ended up losing and was promptly exiled to the far end of the court for a round of Butts Up, in which a player stands motionless while the others try to hit serves into his posterior. Just as he was on that Mexico trip with Pat Cash, Kyrgios was the ringleader and the guy having the most fun \u2014 laughing, shouting, throwing his racket in feigned disgust. This was tennis on his terms, and he seemed genuinely happy.Michael Steinberger last wrote for the magazine about the death of the one-handed backhand in tennis.Advertisement"}

But I don\u2019t know what I want at the moment. Am I content? I don\u2019t have a coach, I can train every now and then. I can take it easy and be maybe 10-20 my entire career. Am I O.K. with that? I don\u2019t know.\u201dNick was the last of three children born to Giorgos and Norlaila Kyrgios. Giorgos immigrated to Australia from Greece as a child and works as a house painter; Norlaila was born in Malaysia and moved to Australia with her mother when she was 12. Neither played much tennis, but all three of their children took up the sport. Kyrgios says his parents pushed him to choose tennis over basketball when he was 14, but they were not pushy \u201ctennis parents\u201d; by all accounts, they were low-key and quite gracious. Kyrgios himself was said to have been a bit spoiled, indulged in the way that babies of the family often are. Still, in the tight-knit Canberra tennis community, he was generally well regarded, as were his parents.He was overweight from a young age. He told me he didn\u2019t have a poor diet as a kid, although his grandmother often treated him to Kentucky Fried Chicken after school; he just ate a lot. The weight made him slow and limited his endurance. It was his effort to find a way around these liabilities that helped turn him into the player we see today. To compensate for his lack of speed, he learned to read the game better than other kids, to know where an opponent\u2019s shot was likely to land before the ball was even struck. And because he needed to end points before his stamina flagged, he developed the first-strike, attacking style that is the hallmark of his game. Somehow, he managed to do all this while resisting the rote drilling that is the bedrock of tennis training. From the start, he had no patience for that kind of practicing; he just wanted to play, and he was so competitive that if no one was keeping score, he wasn\u2019t interested. That is still the case.In 2011, at 16, Kyrgios played with the Australian squad at a Junior Davis Cup tournament in Mexico. Pat Cash, a former Wimbledon champion, was the captain of the team. When Cash and I spoke in the players\u2019 lounge at Wimbledon this year, he told me he\u2019d been struck by the racket speed that Kyrgios generated: \u201cHis arm was so fast, it was like he was playing with a toothpick.\u201d He was also blown away by Kyrgios\u2019s rare combination of power and control. Cash played against a 14-year-old Nadal, and what he saw in Mexico convinced him that Kyrgios was every bit as promising.There were some red flags, though. Cash took the players out for dinner one night and watched Kyrgios inhale two massive burritos \u2014 \u201cthe biggest things you\u2019ve ever seen, must have been 4,000 calories\u201d \u2014 which made him wonder if Kyrgios would ever lose his paunch. Kyrgios was also prone to inexplicable meltdowns and moments of rebellion. During one match, he was crushing a player from Argentina when he suddenly came unhinged, shouting, \u201cI can\u2019t play, I have no rhythm,\u201d before throwing away the second set. On the night before the semifinals, Cash was horrified to discover that Kyrgios, despite nursing a strained muscle, organized a football-throwing competition with teammates on a nearby field. \u201cHe was the ringleader, the cheeky one, the one with the jokes,\u201d Cash told me.Despite the high jinks, histrionics and burritos, Cash came away convinced that Kyrgios was special. At the end of the tournament, he took him aside and said: \u201cNick, no offense to these other guys, but you are unbelievably talented. You can make it. You can be holding the big trophies.\u201d Fifteen months later, Kyrgios, who had finally experienced a growth spurt and was slimming down, won the Junior Australian Open boys\u2019 singles title. The victory instantly marked him as a great hope for Australian tennis \u2014 no easy role. Australia is a sports-crazed nation, and because it has turned out so many celebrated players (Rod Laver, Roy Emerson, Ken Rosewall, Margaret Smith Court, Evonne Goolagong Cawley, Pat Cash, Patrick Rafter, the list goes on), tennis is central to its sporting identity. These players weren\u2019t just great champions, either; they embodied a culture and an ethos. They were plain-spoken, no-fuss athletes, tenacious competitors but also paragons of good cheer and sportsmanship.Kyrgios is the prodigal heir to this tradition. With his brash manner and flamboyant personal style \u2014 showy haircut, sculpted eyebrows, gold chains \u2014 he seems more American than Australian, and his misbehavior and occasional lack of effort infuriate many of his compatriots. At this point, hand-wringing about Kyrgios has become a popular Australian pastime. Last year, the cricket legend Shane Warne posted an open letter to Kyrgios on Facebook, saying, \u201cYou\u2019re testing our patience, mate,\u201d and urging him to shape up. After Kyrgios was fined $1,500 for shouting an obscenity at a tournament last fall in Shanghai, the Australian-rules football star Taylor (Tex) Walker blasted him on Twitter: \u201cWhen is this absolute galoot going to learn. What a dead set flog!!\u201dKyrgios has reason for hard feelings, too. Some of the criticism he has received can take on racial undertones. There was unmistakable nativism at play when the former Olympic champion swimmer Dawn Fraser said last year that if Kyrgios and the fellow tennis bad boy Bernard Tomic, whose parents are from the former Yugoslavia, didn\u2019t improve their behavior, they should \u201cgo back to where their fathers and parents came from. We don\u2019t need them here in this country.\u201d (She later apologized.) The two came under fire again in May, this time from the chef de mission of the Australian Olympic team, a former pentathlete named Kitty Chiller, who warned that if they didn\u2019t curb their antics, they could be kept home from the Rio Games. Her decision to put the players on public notice struck even people not normally sympathetic to Kyrgios as needlessly confrontational. Tomic immediately announced that he would be skipping Rio; Kyrgios followed suit a few weeks later. Although they had a headline-making spat earlier this year, after Tomic suggested that Kyrgios faked illness to get out of a Davis Cup match, the two players are good friends and enjoy the kind of spirited relationship you would expect of guys in their early 20s with multimillion-dollar bank accounts \u2014 like the time Kyrgios, along with a few other players, toilet-papered Tomic\u2019s Lamborghini.Two days after I saw him in Florida, Kyrgios lost his first-round match in Toronto to a Canadian teenager ranked No. 370 in the world. Before the match, Kyrgios tweeted: \u201cEat, Sleep, Pok\u00e9mon GO,\u201d and he evidently still had Squirtles and Venusaurs on the brain when he took the court; he served an appalling 18 double faults, 10 more than Murray coughed up over the course of two weeks and seven matches at Wimbledon. In a press conference, he pointed out the enthusiastic backing his opponent received and took a swipe at his own countrymen: \u201cI think Canadians support their athletes a little better than the Australians do,\u201d he said.To hear Fleming tell it, Kyrgios\u2019s supposed vices were actually virtues. His combustive personality might rankle tennis traditionalists and some members of the media, but it was a boon for the sport. \u201cHe\u2019s unscripted, he can bring in casual fans \u2014 he\u2019s one of the few athletes who can do that,\u201d Fleming said. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely refreshing.\u201d He went on to say that Kyrgios, a product and exemplar of what he called \u201cmodern urban youth culture,\u201d could unlock all sorts of unprecedented opportunities for himself and, by extension, for tennis. He cited Kyrgios\u2019s endorsement deal with Beats by Dre and also told me that the N.B.A. had expressed interest in working with him on cross-promotional activities. To Fleming, Kyrgios had the potential to become a trendsetter and marketing phenom beyond anything tennis has seen. But he quickly added a qualifier: \u201cWinning is the first thing.\u201dAnd despite all the distractions and all the ambivalence, Kyrgios has done a lot of winning. In the last two years, he has notched victories over Nadal, Federer and Murray. In February, he won his first A.T.P. title in Marseilles, and he won his second earlier this month in Atlanta. His forehand \u2014 heavy, sharply angled \u2014 is spoken of with awe by his peers, but his serve may be an even bigger weapon, because of both the pace he generates (as high as 130 miles an hour on his first serve; when the racket strikes, it sounds like a tree limb snapping) and his ability to place the ball. He plays very fast, and when he is serving well, he closes out games in barely a minute. He faced Raonic in the quarterfinals of a tournament in Miami in March, and over the course of four service games in the second set, he surrendered just one point. It\u2019s the kind of efficiency that invites comparisons to Federer and Pete Sampras, who held the record for major titles until Federer eclipsed him.But Kyrgios is still a raw talent, and if he wants to break into the top 10 and contend for majors, he\u2019ll probably need a coach. He has found a mentor of sorts in Radek Stepanek, who is basically his antithesis \u2014 a 37-year-old tennis lifer who adores the game and plans to keep playing until his body gives out. When I talked to Stepanek the day after the two faced off at Wimbledon, he said that they\u2019d struck up a friendship after practicing together in Miami, and that he had offered Kyrgios some general suggestions, along with tips for playing specific opponents. But the first thing they talked about, he said, was attitude: \u201cI told him, \u2018If you don\u2019t want to be here, then you should go home.\u2019\u2009\u201d Stepanek said that he was happy to contribute what he could to Kyrgios\u2019s development, but he had no interest in becoming a full-time coach; he was busy with his own career.A number of people have expressed interest in coaching Kyrgios, but others wonder whether it would just be wasted effort. \u201cYou have to be willing to listen, and you have to have some respect,\u201d Pat Cash says. \u201cHis behavior toward a lot of people shows that he may not be good at either of those things.\u201d His second match at Wimbledon \u2014 against Dustin Brown, a dreadlocked Jamaican-German renowned for his shotmaking prowess \u2014 illustrated the challenge a coach would face. Kyrgios was the better player, but it was clear from the start that he had no intention of ceding the highlight reel to Brown; he was determined to match him, crazy shot for crazy shot. The first set was tennis\u2019s version of slam-dunk contest, a showboating extravaganza. A coach would have implored Kyrgios to stick with plain vanilla tennis, but it\u2019s doubtful he would have listened. As Kyrgios told me, \u201cI like to hit fun shots.\u201d He ended up beating Brown in five sets, but his lack of discipline made the match far more difficult than it might otherwise have been.Could the \u201cfun shots\u201d be Kyrgios\u2019s way of finding pleasure in a sport that he says doesn\u2019t offer him a lot of fulfillment? It\u2019s possible that the ambivalence he expresses about tennis really is his way of deflecting pressure, or that he does it just to get a rise out of people; he\u2019s only 21, and his game has matured much faster than he has. But maybe, when he says that he doesn\u2019t love tennis, he is telling the truth. It wouldn\u2019t necessarily doom his career: Agassi reached No. 1 and claimed eight major titles even though he spent much of his life hating tennis. John Morris told me Kyrgios is so competitive \u2014 they play I Spy on car trips, and Kyrgios goes bonkers if he doesn\u2019t win \u2014 that he might end up atop the sport in spite of how he feels about it. For now, he remains one of those players who gratify and torment tennis fans in equal measure. Some athletes spend their careers thrilling us, others spend their careers frustrating us and some do both. Maybe Kyrgios is destined to be one of those.That Saturday in Boca, though, recharged by a recent visit home and together with his girlfriend, Kyrgios seemed content to be on the tennis court. He was practicing with a pair of 17-year-old Americans, Gianni Ross and Sam Riffice, in a typical Kyrgios practice session: He just wanted to play points, while keeping up a running commentary for his audience, a group that included me, Ross\u2019s parents, Tomljanovic\u2019s father, a couple of teenage girls who were apparently there to ogle and Robbye Poole, Serena Williams\u2019s hitting partner, who happened to be at the academy that day. His Pok\u00e9mon buddy Tauheed Browning was perched by the fence on Kyrgios\u2019s side of the court. At one point, I overheard Kyrgios jokingly upbraiding him, saying, \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be my coach!\u201dAfter maybe 30 minutes, Kyrgios decided it was time to kick back. He summoned Browning, Langston Williams and Poole to join in for some Touch Tennis, a game in which players stand close to the net and hit delicate flick shots back and forth until someone misses. Browning ended up losing and was promptly exiled to the far end of the court for a round of Butts Up, in which a player stands motionless while the others try to hit serves into his posterior. Just as he was on that Mexico trip with Pat Cash, Kyrgios was the ringleader and the guy having the most fun \u2014 laughing, shouting, throwing his racket in feigned disgust. This was tennis on his terms, and he seemed genuinely happy.Michael Steinberger last wrote for the magazine about the death of the one-handed backhand in tennis.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Are Final Clubs Too Exclusive for Harvard?", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne midnight near semester\u2019s end on the skirts of Harvard Yard, music thumped and laughs rang out from a colonnaded, Greek-revival mansion, the sort usually seen in Hollywood fantasies about fraternal campus life. But it was the scene outside that suggested something other than a frat party. This was the headquarters of the Fly, an exclusive men\u2019s fellowship known here as a final club. At its side door stood a silver-haired man in tuxedo, checking names against a list of the lucky invited. Eager young women in micro-minis queued up.Except one. A lone girl sat on the front steps, bathed by yellow light spilling from windows in which the silhouettes of revelers held pool cues and beer bottles. She was hunched over, legs flopped on either side, face in hands. She had managed to get in but was \u201ckicked out,\u201d she wailed into a phone pressed against her ear. Her cheeks were reddened, streaked with mascara.Now, she sobbed, \u201cthey won\u2019t let me in!\u201dA group of young men stood in the doorway, hands shoved in pockets, chatting. Every so often they cast an awkward glance at the young woman.The Fly is one of six remaining all-male final clubs. They are, if not the hub, the apex of social life at Harvard \u2014 upscale surrogates for those classic centers of college merriment, sororities and fraternities.On any given weekend, a string of young women spools out onto Mount Auburn Street in front of one or another of the club porticos. And while there might be legitimate reasons to exclude them, from intoxication to overcrowding, the crying woman on the stairs underscored the power the final clubs have over the student psyche. Entree can feel like belonging, rejection like a scarlet F.Some students describe final clubs as nothing more than fun outlets on a campus with few options for unsupervised play. To those who join they offer a close-knit group of friends and a refuge from the high pressure of the Harvard course load. After graduation, members enjoy access to an extensive alumni network.To many students, the clubs remain potent symbols of privilege, anachronistic and out of place on an increasingly diverse campus.These clashing perceptions have roiled the community over the past year, with the administration falling squarely into the camp that final clubs and all they represent, wittingly or not, do not belong at Harvard. It is a long-held stance that has resulted in periodic action by the university \u2014 and counterpunches by the clubs.The decision stands to have ramifications beyond Cambridge, Mass., by ratifying a movement that is taking hold across the country: to make student social life more inclusive.In an interview a few days after graduation, Dr. Khurana softened his rhetoric. \u201cIt\u2019s not our intention to make the students feel persecuted,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to just say to our students: The issue is not our students. I think they are people of immense character and integrity. We are trying to create the conditions to allow our students to become the kind of people they say they want to become in their admissions essays.\u201dThe push to end, or at least reform, final clubs is also informed by the urgent discussion nationwide of sexual assault on campus. A 2015 survey of several universities by the Association of American Universities found that by the time they were seniors, 47 percent of Harvard women who had participated in final club activities had experienced unwanted sexual touch, compared with 31 percent schoolwide.Richard T. Porteus, class of \u201978 and president of the Fly\u2019s graduate body, is one of the few final club members to publicly challenge the college. \u201cIf Harvard really were to become serious about preventing sexual assault rather than using it as a way to push an ideological stance,\u201d he told me, \u201cthey\u2019d drill down to find out exactly what is occurring rather than trying to throw a moral pall over any man or women who belongs to these clubs.\u201dTo charges that the men cast themselves in the role of patriarchal gatekeeper, Mr. Porteus made a pragmatic argument: The clubhouses have limited capacity, and invitation-only protects members and guests, particularly women. And the doorkeeper, a part-time staff member and parent of a college student, can assess the sobriety of guests, entering and departing.In a stab at the dean, he concluded: \u201cWhat is more patriarchal than an older male authority figure deciding for young women where and how they should spend their personal time when off-campus?\u201dThe clubs have adamantly defied demands to become coeducational not for exclusivity\u2019s sake, Mr. Porteus said, but out of a belief that what a single-gender space offers is of deep value. \u201cWhether you\u2019re a man or a woman or you identify in any other way, you\u2019re curious to learn from others of the gender you identify with,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why single-gender entities exist, from Wellesley College to the Boy Scouts of America.\u201d\u201cIt is not,\u201d he said, \u201ca rejection of anyone.\u201d\u2022Up the stairwell is a gallery of memories \u2014 photos of famous members like Franklin Delano Roosevelt and members killed in war \u2014 leading to the trophy room. This is a space clearly created by young men for young men. Animal busts decorate the walls. There are large speakers for music. Billiard tables have been topped with glass, good for table tennis and beer pong.\u201cEach is unique in its policy and procedures,\u201d said Mr. Porteus, a charter school founder. \u201cThe clubs do not act in concert, seldom and sporadically share information, and in many respects are rivals. Dean Khurana is describing all clubs as though they were the same.\u201dAn alumnus, or graduate member, agreed to talk about the lasting meaning the Porc has for its members. He described how quaint bonding activities, like all-male black-tie dinners in which members perform club songs and tell stories from its history, forged lasting friendships. Lunch is taken together almost every day in the club. After graduation, dinners are held monthly, worldwide, allowing far-flung alumni to retain those friendships.Because of the club\u2019s policy of secrecy, which harks back hundreds of years, the member would speak only on condition he not be named \u2014 and in a conversation monitored by a public relations representative who periodically told him he was saying too much and to stop talking.History is venerated, and he was eager to tell how it is passed down through the many artworks and objets d\u2019art housed in its clubhouse, including thousands of renderings of boars, its emblem. Alexander Calder, a rare exception to the nonvisitor policy, was so taken with the place, the story goes, that he gifted a sculpture depicting two mating boars; it was once lent to the Whitney Museum of American Art for a retrospective. Far from fraternity hazing, Porc initiation rites include memorizing and reciting each item\u2019s provenance and meaning in pop quizzes.The Porcellian is considering becoming coed, the member said. \u201cEven though it\u2019s the oldest club, it\u2019s not blindly and foolishly wedded to a certain way of being,\u201d he said. \u201cThe club, in order to stay relevant for its members, needs to continue to evolve.\u201d What it is rejecting is being forced by outside parties to do so \u2014 and instantly.If the groups were to bend and turn coed, whatever it is they do behind their stately doors and Corinthian columns could continue. Last year, a few relented: The Spee and Fox admitted women, though in response to alumni backlash the Fox\u2019s were provisional members.Contrary to the patrician conception of the club, the graduate member said, the current new class, though under a dozen, as is typical, is diverse, including several students of color as well as foreign students. Yet the clubs are stymied by both their image problem and closelipped policies. He understood that conundrum: \u201cWe recognize that as an all-male club, and particularly as the oldest all-male club, even if you take the time to learn about our traditions, our quirky weird traditions, we are just not a sympathetic figure and never will be in the public eye.\u201d\u2022But instead of breaking down barriers, more single-gender organizations emerged. In the early \u201990s, the first female-only final clubs and sororities arose.\u201cWe had often found ourselves on the steps of a final club trying to get into a party and being chosen or not chosen by these men, who own this real estate,\u201d Eugenia B. Schraa Huh, a founder of the women-only Sabli\u00e8re Society, told me. \u201cThere was this feeling of us being powerless on the social scene. We absolutely founded the club to help correct a power imbalance at Harvard.\u201dBut parity has remained elusive. The women\u2019s clubs have their own level of exclusivity, and their social role is limited because many of them do not have dedicated spaces (some partner with men\u2019s clubs for parties, or co-host dinners \u2014 at the Fly, for example, with wine served from its cellar). The rub with the new rules is that they apply to all single-gender clubs.Caroline Tervo, a member of the Pleiades Society (a women\u2019s club named for the \u201cseven sisters\u201d star cluster), addressed the crowd before the march: \u201cGender discrimination happens every day. It happens in the classroom, when men are called on more often; in the workplace, when men are paid more; and on the weekend, when women are targeted and shamed for their sexuality. On a campus and in a society that is still so male dominated, female spaces are necessary sources of empowerment.\u201dOn the day sanctions were announced, women in Greek-lettered T-shirts huddled in urgent discussion around campus. On Facebook, fraternity and sorority members changed their profile pictures to their organization\u2019s insignia in solidarity. Many want final clubs to change but believe that by including other groups the university painted with too broad a brush.\u201cThere is a lot of value in targeting some of the exclusionary aspects of the final clubs, and making sure we are working toward the same goals collectively,\u201d said Rebecca Ramos, a rising senior and president of the Delta Gamma chapter, one of the Greek organizations that took root here in the early \u201990s. But, she told me, \u201cThe administration has tried to target the entire single sex-social organization scene in one fell swoop, as opposed to targeting certain organizations that don\u2019t align with the values expressed by the mission of Harvard College.\u201dShe said that sisters of her sorority, which is open to all women, including transgender women, act as guardians of one another\u2019s mental health, watching for signs of emotional distress and coming to their aid to share coping mechanisms or just hugs. \u201cWe\u2019ve been emotional support throughout many difficult times for our sisters,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are really concerned about losing that on campus. Harvard can be a really difficult place to be.\u201dIt is a place where social pressure is palpable. Several dozen students refused to discuss final clubs on the record. One, rushing across campus in a seersucker suit on his way to a Kentucky Derby-watching party, summed up the sentiment of many when he said that if you have an opinion that might offend someone, keep it to yourself. Even detractors feared being dropped from a final club\u2019s party rolls. Some worried they would be blacklisted from certain professions after graduation if a powerful club alumnus got wind of any criticism. Several students were afraid they would not be able to get a job in academia, or of getting bad grades, if they criticized Harvard.Ana Andrade, a freshman folded into a chair in the center of Harvard Yard between final exams, felt emboldened enough to comment on the clubs\u2019 social impact. Particularly galling for her are the mechanics of a final club party, where women, dressed to impress, show up hoping to be picked from the crowd and invited in. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the patriarchy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s perpetuated right there.\u201dThe process, she noted, has an Ivy League twist: Women are not measured merely by the velvet-rope yardstick of physical beauty. A \u201cHarvard 10,\u201d she explained, is a mix of intellect, social status and academic je ne sais quoi. Yet the idea that men determine women\u2019s worth, she said, made her too uncomfortable to participate.Amir Khan, a 23-year-old student at a local community college, has borne uneasy witness to young men as the gatekeepers of Harvard social life. He drives a cab at night, and regularly picks up profoundly inebriated women from outside final clubs. \u201cYou give them power and they think that everyone has to kneel down to them,\u201d Mr. Khan said of the club members. \u201cEven with girls, that\u2019s how they look at it. They get to pick; it\u2019s their choice. You let these kids grow up like this and they\u2019ll have this mentality for the rest of their lives.\u201d\u201cBy the same logic,\u201d he pointed out, \u201cin another year or by another dean, members of the Chilton Club, of the D.A.R., or of a political party advocating Muslim exclusion might also be considered deficient relative to Harvard\u2019s standards of nondiscrimination.\u201dRobert Shibley, executive director of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, an organization that defends freedom of speech on college campuses, likened the sanctions to a blacklist. \u201cIt is solely up to arbitrary judgment of the authorities as to who is no longer savory enough,\u201d he told me. \u201cIn the \u201950s that would have been the Communist Party. Once you start using that as a reason to disqualify, there is no principled place to stop.\u201d\u201cWhen you don\u2019t have an equal opportunity for people of different points of views to participate in what\u2019s supposed to be a marketplace of ideas,\u201d Mr. Shibley said, \u201cyou\u2019re impoverishing that education.\u201dOn Mount Auburn Street, defense of the clubs is more visceral. It was a spring night at the Phoenix S.K. Club, and young women were swiftly waved in, known so well they exchanged double-cheeked kisses with the doorkeeper. Inside, they danced under crystal chandeliers beside art depicting Revolutionary War soldiers.As students swayed to a live band, a young man picked up a microphone. \u201cEverybody say hi to Dean Khurana, he\u2019s in the back!\u201d he yelled.The name drew curses from the dance floor.\u2022Harvard is but the most prestigious wave in an ocean of unrest on college campuses regarding single-gender extracurricular groups. With fraternities caught up in allegations of sexual misconduct across the country, the movement to abolish them has gained momentum. In 2014, Wesleyan University ruled that its small group of residential fraternities must integrate women. Greek organizations have been banned altogether from Amherst College. Middlebury College has replaced them with mixed-gender \u201csocial houses.\u201dStudies underscore the connection between binge drinking, assault and Greek life. A 2007 study by John D. Foubert, a professor of higher education at Oklahoma State University, found that members of frats have three times the likelihood of committing rape as nonmembers. But whether abolishing male organizations improves the environment for women remains to be seen.\u201cThere are lots of questions we don\u2019t have research about,\u201d Dr. Foubert said. Good metrics are hard to come by: A rise in sexual assault complaints can be a good sign \u2014 \u201cthe women trust the institution more,\u201d he said \u2014 and \u201ckids can drink alcohol in any setting undetected.\u201dSome experts worry that bad behavior would just move underground.Despite the turmoil, nothing seismic happened when the Fox went coed, according to one member interviewed outside the clubhouse. (He would not give his full name because the club forbids members to speak to the news media.) \u201cPeople were worried that, \u2018Oh, we can\u2019t act the same way, we can\u2019t act up,\u2019\u2009\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see it changing. I think it\u2019s a cool experience with having a different perspective in the club.\u201dSome fear what their commitment to such clubs will mean for their future. Mitchell York briefly questioned his hope to punch this year when, as a sophomore, he\u2019ll be eligible. But the promise of lifelong friends outweighed any hesitation. It even trumped the specter of reprisal, and any anxiety of being associated with a club at the cross hairs of a conversation about sexual assault.That\u2019s because the solution, Mr. York believes, lies in the club members themselves. \u201cI know that I would never have an issue with what the final clubs are accused of,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople who are joining, and people who are in them currently, have to take on the responsibility to make sure that these things don\u2019t happen.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Page 16 this weekend about Harvard final clubs misstates the academic degree held by Richard T.

Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s go!The open road has long been a siren song for those wishing to cross the country by car, motorcycle, even bicycle. Add another traveling type to the list: runners, who are setting off on foot, often with a fund-raising hook and a social media following.\u00e2\u0080\u009cBetween 10 and 20 people run across the country every summer now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThousands more people have climbed Everest than have run across the country.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. McCord completed his run in 180 days with two breaks \u2014 one to attend a wedding, and another to attend a graduation. He said the physical part wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the biggest hurdle. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe challenge is keeping your sanity while you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Country crossers have heard every \u00e2\u0080\u009cForrest Gump\u00e2\u0080\u009d joke in the book. But unlike that fictional character, who set off from Santa Monica Pier and \u00e2\u0080\u009cjust kept on going,\u00e2\u0080\u009d almost all who undertake the challenge have a set goal in mind, and they plan and train for the journey well in advance.Adam Kimble ran a number of long races in 2014 and 2015, including the Leadville Silver Rush 50 miler, the Yellowstone Teton 100 miler, the Ultra-Trail Cape Town 100K and the Gobi March 250K in China, which he won, before attempting his cross-country trek, which he successfully completed in April. Mr. Kimble, who had quit his job as an event planner before the run, set off from Huntington Beach, Calif., hoping to break the Guinness World Record for the men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fastest time crossing the country on foot \u00e2\u0080\u0093 46 days, 8 hours and 36 minutes. But an inflamed tendon in his shin plus iliotibial band issues meant he had to scrap that plan, focusing on simply finishing the run. He shifted his endpoint from New York City to Tybee Island, Ga., and finished the 2,500-mile run in 60 days. He celebrated his finish with a big breakfast and a couple of Yuenglings (he hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t allowed himself beer during the crossing). The journey, he said, helped start him on a new career: He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now a motivational speaker and an ambassador for a handful of running-related products. Keila Merino, a New York City public school teacher and two-time New York Road Runners ultramarathoner of the year, set out to run across the country earlier this summer. She was inspired in part by others who had already completed the journey and also by \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnstoppable Woman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a book about Mavis Hutchison, a South African runner who was the first woman to run across the United States in 1978 and who still holds the Guinness World Record for women: 69 days, 2 hours and 40 minutes. Ms. Merino wanted to break that record while also raising money for Mighty Milers, a New York Road Runners youth running program where she is also a coach. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more of a dream than just a goal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said before starting her run. Nailing down the logistics of the run while working full time wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t easy, she said. And her training plan involved running a marathon every day. She got sponsors and volunteers to help pay for the trip, map a route, arrange her crew and calculate how far she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d need to run each day if she was to meet her goal of breaking Ms. Hutchison\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record.Social media has been a boon for those making the crossings now, said Mr. McCord, something he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have when he did his run in 2002. It makes it easier to connect with fund-raising sources as well as others who have completed the run and may have useful advice. In addition, runners can arrange for others to act as temporary pacers and organize support crews in different locales as they complete their run, not to mention a fan base.\u00e2\u0080\u009cBack then it was hard to get the word out other than newspaper and radio and news clips on TV,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. McCord said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so awesome about these guys and gals who get to run across the country now is they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got thousands of people following them\u00e2\u0080\u009d on social media. Ms. Merino had more than 2,000 people following her run on Facebook when she began it in Los Angeles on July 1. (Mr. Kimble has more than 12,000 Facebook fans, many of them picked up during this cross-country run.) She had planned to run 50 miles a day, mostly overnight because of the heat, and finish in mid-August. On day two, she rolled her ankle, though she kept on running. Several days later, her knee went, and after 16 days she had to call off the run. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little bit of a heartbreak,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. She says she will try again, and next time plan her route better, since she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been surprised by finding that some of the roads on her route were closed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m the type of person who doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like to be down on it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Merino said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll learn and then move on.

{"Headline": "A \u2018Sex and the City\u2019 for African Viewers", "Date": "2016-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe women fit perfectly into Carrie- or Miranda-type boxes. Nana Yaa, the main character, is a radio journalist who ponders existential dating questions in voice-overs throughout the show. Zainab and Makena both function as a Miranda \u2014 fiercely independent and all about their business. Ngozi is the church girl who works for a nongovernmental organization and purses her lips at too much talk about the male anatomy. And Sade is Samantha, with condoms spilling from the designer handbags that her rich, married boyfriend buys for her. The women spend an enormous amount of time sipping cocktails in dimly lit restaurants as they chat about rolling power outages, good condom etiquette and men who expect them to leave their jobs and make fufu all day.The five women are all \u201creturnees,\u201d the children of families who left Ghana for the West and then came home with so-called \u201creturnee savior syndrome.\u201d The phrase \u201cto whom much is given, much is required\u201d could be their unofficial motto, as it frames their interactions and challenges their way of thinking. They are constantly fretting about whether they would tip so little if back in Manhattan, or why the \u201cwhite wedding\u201d is considered better than a traditional one.The show has received deserved criticism for the distance it maintains from the side of Ghana that doesn\u2019t yet have street signs or personal chauffeurs. Some of the women\u2019s biggest problems are the usual complaints of the well off. Are their maids stealing their bras? Shouldn\u2019t their neighbors buy expensive silencers for their power generators so the women can sleep a bit more peacefully at night? This is Ghana\u2019s 1 percent, portraying a lifestyle that few on the continent can relate to.Just like the original, \u201cSex and the City.\u201dBut the show\u2019s appeal comes from the ability to turn the same discussions that women around the world are having over cocktails and in group texts into a salient critique of Western and African cultures.Bringing a handsome lawyer from Washington home to meet the traditional West African family reveals the divide between black people in Africa and black people from the United States. The question of entitlement is explored through familial connections high up in government. And a conversation about a particular form of birth control earns a quick and snappy referendum on colonialism, as Zainab says, \u201cThe only time you will hear me support the pullout method is happily discussing the British pulling out of Ghana in 1975.\u201dIn an interview, Ms. Amarteifio said most of her audience outside of Africa is in the United States, followed by Britain, France and Canada. Though the themes of love and sisterhood are universal, she assumes most of those viewers are members of the African diaspora.Black women in Houston thanked her for showing women in natural hair and stunning African clothes, she said. And surprisingly, older women have nudged her to push past boundaries.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely my mother\u2019s generation who come up to me and say, \u2018Good job, good job, keep it going!\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s because they like the fact that these are five young women talking so freely about sex, and there\u2019s something so liberating about these five women. Maybe they didn\u2019t feel in their day that they were that free.\u201dIn an episode from Season 1, some of Sade\u2019s luggage is held up at customs for upward of three months, leaving her without her beloved vibrator. She says she would have brought it in her carry-on instead \u201cif I had known that you can\u2019t get one in Togo, Benin, Ghana \u2014 anywhere in West Africa for that matter.\u201dA later episode has them mystified by social media and its role in a society that is already confounded by the murky lines drawn around traditional marriages. After Zainab\u2019s date assures her that he is not married or seeing anyone, he friends her on Facebook without bothering to hide his actual marital status. \u201cWhen a man in Ghana says that he\u2019s single, it means that his wife is just in another country or in another city or the other room,\u201d Sade tells her.In Season 2, Makena\u2019s African-American boyfriend is upset to learn that her family\u2019s houseboy calls her uncle \u201cmaster,\u201d and she herself goes into personal crisis when her aunt tells her that the family once owned slaves. One episode shows a store clerk pushing bleaching cream on one of the girls, telling her that she would be so much prettier if she weren\u2019t so dark.Ms. Amarteifio is a returnee herself, as are many of the cast members. She moved back to Ghana after attending graduate school at Georgetown, intent on doing development work in her own country. She got a job with the government in development, but her heart wasn\u2019t really in it. Then she fell in love, got her heart broken and binged on the DVD box set of \u201cSex and the City.\u201d Watching it, she said, felt like watching her and her friends gallivanting around her own version of New York City.\u201cThese women are actually very familiar,\u201d she remembers thinking. \u201cWomen I know in Accra, women I know in Kigali or Nairobi or Lagos or Monrovia.\u201dShe has also talked with Netflix, which she said is likely to be the future home for Seasons 1 and 2. And she and Netflix are discussing \u201cThe Republic,\u201d another show that she\u2019s working on. It will be an African version of the ABC show \u201cScandal.\u201dMeanwhile, she has begun work on Season 3 of \u201cAn African City.\u201d She doesn\u2019t foresee the happily-ever-after ending that \u201cSex in the City\u201d had, a bow-tied finale that remains scrutinized today. Rather, she says, she wants to continue to tell stories about Ghana through the eyes of young returnees looking for love on their home continent.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Champion of Human Rights in China Leaves a Tarnished Legacy", "Date": "2016-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Harry Wu, who spent 19 years in Chinese labor camps, was a familiar figure on Capitol Hill, delivering searing broadsides against China\u2019s authoritarian government that drew admiration from American politicians condemning the country\u2019s human rights abuses.His close relationship with lawmakers helped Mr. Wu secure a $17 million grant from Yahoo in 2007 to aid families of persecuted dissidents, when the tech giant was facing withering criticism for assisting the Chinese authorities in identifying activists who had used the company\u2019s email service.But by the time Mr. Wu, 79, died in April, his legacy had become tarnished. He provided just $1.2 million to dissidents\u2019 families, while spending more than $13 million of the Yahoo money to operate his own foundation, which runs a website and a small museum, according to financial disclosures, court documents and interviews with former employees, foundation board members and human rights advocates.\u201cAmerican politicians think of Harry Wu as a hero, but the truth is he is an immoral person who betrayed the very people he was supposed to be helping,\u201d said Wang Jing, 47, the wife of a dissident.In a letter released days after his death, seven prominent dissidents in China called on American officials to investigate what they described as spending irregularities by the organization, the Laogai Research Foundation, and announced plans to file a lawsuit seeking that the roughly $3 million that remained from Yahoo\u2019s original grant be given to another group. Human rights advocates have been especially critical of Yahoo, whose executives sat on the foundation board until earlier this year but largely stood by as Mr. Wu overrode objections that he was inappropriately using the fund to buy real estate, run his museum and defend himself against lawsuits, according to board members and former employees.Yahoo\u2019s largess was not entirely selfless, and was widely seen as an effort to soothe public anger after the company provided the Chinese authorities the identities of Yahoo subscribers in China who had used their email accounts to distribute writings or documents that had angered the government. At least four of those email users were later jailed.The controversy underscores recurring issues of corporate social responsibility and unintended consequences as Silicon Valley executives, eager to tap into China\u2019s vast market, seek to win favor with the country\u2019s authoritarian rulers. In 2014, the social network site LinkedIn agreed to censor its results in China, and last year IBM provoked concern in the White House after it began allowing Chinese officials to examine proprietary source codes for its products. Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook has courted Chinese leaders in hopes of gaining access to the country\u2019s 700 million internet users.Yahoo, which was bought by Verizon last month, declined to respond to questions about its role overseeing the grant to Mr. Wu\u2019s organization, saying only in a statement: \u201cWe remain an industry leader in our commitment to protect and promote freedom of expression and privacy online.\u201dIn an interview two weeks before his death, Mr. Wu brushed off allegations of financial impropriety and defended his decision to largely discontinue giving grants to Chinese dissidents and their families. He said that foundation employees, unable to obtain visas to enter China, found it hard to verify the financial information provided by aid applicants. But he made little effort to hide his disdain for Chinese human rights activists who sought grants, describing them as greedy, deceitful and ungrateful. \u201cSome of them lie to us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are frustrated by these Chinese victims.\u201dThe Yahoo Human Rights Fund was born from a remarkable act of public humiliation. In the fall of 2007, Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Jerry Yang, was summoned to Congress and, on live television, sharply criticized by members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. As relatives of two jailed Chinese dissidents sat behind him, lawmakers spent nearly three hours criticizing the company\u2019s decision to cooperate with Chinese security agents, and for lying about its conduct during an earlier congressional hearing. \u201cWhile technologically and financially you are giants, morally you are pygmies,\u201d said Representative Tom Lantos, Democrat of California, who was then chairman of the committee. Mr. Lantos, a Holocaust survivor who died in 2008, urged Yahoo to offer financial compensation to the two dissidents\u2019 families.Visibly shaken, Mr. Yang, the son of Taiwanese immigrants, bowed apologetically. He met with the relatives and offered each family $3.2 million to settle a lawsuit against the company, according to Morton Sklar, a lawyer who represented the families. Mr. Yang also pledged $17.3 million to help other victims of Chinese rights abuses, especially those persecuted for using the internet to criticize the government. To administer the fund, Mr. Yang turned to Mr. Wu, the bespectacled figure who had been serving as translator for the relatives.After arriving in the United States in 1985, Mr. Wu had become a politically connected figure whose suffering made him a forceful symbol of the Communist Party\u2019s war on free speech, religious liberty and individual rights. With his tales of torture and starvation during his nearly two decades of imprisonment, Mr. Wu was a riveting presence at congressional hearings. \u201cHarry Wu was Exhibit A for members of Congress trying to highlight China\u2019s bad behavior with respect to human rights,\u201d said Nicholas Bequelin, director of Asia programs at Amnesty International. \u201cHis story gelled with the American narrative of heroic dissidents who had stood up to the state.\u201dMr. Sklar said Yahoo had hoped its fund would help repair its public image, but also serve as a reservoir of money for settling future claims from other Chinese dissidents \u2014 an arrangement that critics said was legally and ethically questionable. \u201cThey saw the fund as their get-out-of-jail-free card,\u201d Mr. Sklar said. \u201cBut Harry Wu saw the money as his own personal fund, to benefit his own activities.\u201dMr. Wu\u2019s role as administrator of the money proved problematic. In 2011, Yu Ling, the wife of one of the jailed activists, filed a lawsuit claiming Mr. Wu had pressured her to turn over the $3.2 million settlement and then purchased a $1 million annuity in his name. Mr. Wu eventually returned the money but a litany of grant applicants would later cite other irregularities. Some say they never received the money he had promised; others recalled signing blank disbursement forms but receiving only partial payment. A review of the organization\u2019s financial disclosure forms reveals at least $190,000 that is unaccounted for.Over the years, other allegations raised questions about Mr. Wu\u2019s fitness to administer the Yahoo fund. They included charges of domestic abuse by his wife that resulted in two years of probation. Ms. Wang, the wife of the dissident Yang Hai, alleged that Mr. Wu sexually harassed three adolescent girls, including her 16-year-old daughter, in her care in the Washington area, and then cut off a monthly stipend after Ms. Wang accused him in a still-pending lawsuit of sexual assault.In interviews, more than a dozen employees and board members of Mr. Wu\u2019s foundation say he bullied critics and rode roughshod over objections that he was spending too much on his organization and too little on the victims. In some years, financial disclosure forms show that the foundation spent less than 2 percent of annual disbursements on direct assistance to Chinese dissidents or their families; in recent years, such grants all but dried up.Mr. Wu, the employees said, made all spending decisions. Grants ranged from several hundred dollars to $10,000 but most averaged about $3,000, according to disclosure forms. Liao Tienchi, who says she was fired after a decade of working as Mr. Wu\u2019s assistant because she questioned his spending, said Yahoo ignored letters and emails she sent expressing concern. \u201cHe will harm the organization and damage the image of Yahoo,\u201d she warned in one letter sent in 2010. \u201cScandals will be exposed and it would be a heavy blow to the human rights issue in China.\u201dJeff Fiedler, an influential union leader and a former foundation board member, said he relinquished his seat five years ago in frustration. \u201cHarry was uncooperative and saw the money as his alone,\u201d he said. \u201cHe became extremely unreasonable.\u201d Over the years, Mr. Fiedler and other board members say Yahoo, whose in-house counsel was required to sign all disbursement checks, tried to intervene but ultimately extricated the company from Mr. Wu\u2019s foundation. In 2015, the company dissolved the Yahoo Human Rights Fund; in January, the company\u2019s representative resigned from the foundation.Mr. Wu, who earned $130,000 a year as executive director of the organization, used $2.5 million of the Yahoo grant last year to purchase a townhouse for offices and the museum in Washington, which is devoted to Chinese labor camps. Documents show that he spent more than $800,000 on legal fees to defend himself against at least four lawsuits filed by grant applicants, aid recipients and former employees, all of which were later settled or dropped.The Internal Revenue Service last year fined his organization about $40,000 for financial irregularities but stopped short of seeking the revocation of its nonprofit status, according to Mr. Wu.Thousands of people in China have been persecuted for publicly expressing their political views, and the government has often punished their families by denying them jobs, barring their children from schools and pressuring landlords to evict them from their homes. Humanitarian China, a California-based organization that gives grants to impoverished dissidents and their families, gives money to about 100 recipients a year, a marked contrast to the roughly 130 people who received grants from Laogai over the past decade.\u201cWe scramble to raise a few thousand dollars each year,\u201d said Yaxue Cao, a board member of the organization. \u201cImagine what we could have done with $17 million.\u201dIn the final interview before his death, Mr. Wu expressed annoyance over allegations against him and defended his decision to spend the bulk of the Yahoo money on his unfinished museum, which documents the horrors of China\u2019s forced labor camps.\u201cI thought a museum was the best way to make that happen, so we collected so many documents and personal testimonies to tell the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anyone has a better solution, I would accept that.\u201d Then he leaned forward and lowered his booming voice. \u201cI am 79,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m almost at the end.\u201dEmily Feng contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

From 2009 to 2012, calls to the police about burglary, stolen and abandoned vehicles, domestic violence and public disturbances dropped significantly.\u201cPeople are involved with each other, not just sitting at home with their curtains closed,\u201d said Hite. \u201cI\u2019m out on the street meeting my neighbors.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s still an economically depressed area,\u201d said Thompson. \u201cThere\u2019s not many jobs here. But it\u2019s safer and more hopeful. Young people are realizing they can go to college. The main difference is that we don\u2019t leave people by themselves anymore.\u201dAt a time when poverty and economic insecurity remain widespread in the United States, how does a very poor community like the Highlands strengthen its capacity to improve itself? What does the possibility of change look like from the vantage point of ordinary citizens who care about their community, but struggle to see a path to a better future?The separation made little sense: Youths who commit violence or drug-related crimes at 17, or drop out of school at 15, often have received a first suspension in second grade and have experienced abuse or neglect as toddlers or infants. It is now understood that the best hope of interrupting this downward spiral requires yearslong collaboration between child welfare specialists, parents, educators, health workers, police officers, legal advocates and community members.In the early 1990s, Washington set up a Family Policy Council with a statewide mandate to foster integrated approaches to youth violence. It was a pioneering idea. But the council\u2019s annual budget was only $4 million \u2014 less than $1 per resident \u2014 and these problems were among the nation\u2019s toughest social challenges.\u201cThe question was: How could we make population-level changes on these problems, given the resources that we had?\u201d Laura Porter, who directed the council from 1998 to 2013, recalled. She and her colleagues chose to focus on helping cities and counties establish their own community networks. \u201cThe law said if you want to create your own local network, you can petition the state \u2014 and you get to design it and run it,\u201d she said.From 1994 to 2012, 53 communities across Washington State set up networks to address youth violence. The council helped these groups establish processes to cultivate leadership and broad partnerships, work with local citizens to set priorities and goals, use evidence to make decisions, and continue educating themselves.In the last 10 years, awareness about these experiences has proved vital to understanding the need to protect children from chronic adversity or trauma. It also provides a common framework and language within which communities can pursue mutually reinforcing strategies in related areas \u2014 education, child and family welfare, the justice system, youth development \u2014 to break intergenerational patterns of dysfunction and poverty.And the changes in the Highlands \u2014 the poorest part of Cowlitz County, with a poverty rate of 45 percent \u2014 have been particularly noteworthy.In 2006, Longview authorized a revitalization plan for the neighborhood. To shape it, city officials invoked the community network ethos of \u201cengaging the locals to identify and prioritize their own needs\u201d and went door-to-door to speak with residents, according to John Brickey, Longview\u2019s community development director.What did residents want changed? At the top of the list was the neighborhood\u2019s appearance. They wanted porch lights turned on at night, yards maintained, garbage and debris hauled away, and feral dogs rounded up. They asked the city to build a walking and biking trail along the neighborhood\u2019s south side, an area alongside a flood control ditch and industrial road that was dark and poorly maintained.\u201cThere had been so many assumptions about the Highlands,\u201d Porter recalled. \u201cOutsiders believed that the people there were dealing drugs and wanted the lights off and the dogs around to keep officials away. It turned out the residents couldn\u2019t afford light bulbs. They said, \u2018You guys think we need all this therapy, but we actually need the garbage picked up and the wild dogs cleared out.\u2019 \u201dHaeck started by eliciting leadership from residents. \u201cFor the most part, people welcomed me into their homes,\u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd I started to recognize what a wonderful community it was. We\u2019d just sit and talk. What do you want? How do you want to do it?\u201d\u201cWhen I met Liz,\u201d Hite said, \u201cshe gave me inspiration and a sense of wonder about what we could do to make things better.\u201d Hite signed on as vice president of the neighborhood association and later became president. \u201cWe started with porch lights. So many people didn\u2019t have them. We had light bulbs donated and we had a big celebration.\u201dHaeck\u2019s encouragement left residents believing that change might be possible, Hite said. Members of the neighborhood association discovered they could apply for \u2014 and win \u2014 grants. \u201cWe\u2019d get together and they\u2019d talk and I\u2019d write it down in a proposal and ask, \u2018How\u2019s this?\u2019 \u201d said Haeck. \u201cThey\u2019d read it and critique it. One resident always told me I used too many commas.\u201dThe city cobbled together funding to build the walking and biking trail. Then Highland residents purchased and renovated a community center, set up a community library, created a community garden, and organized a graffiti-removal team, block watches, and scores of neighborhood cleanups.Initially, residents were reluctant to interact with the police. But soon enough, they and police officers were gathering for monthly \u201ccop chats.\u201d \u201cWe set up a Facebook page and we asked the community to help us solve problems \u2014 and we\u2019ve been overwhelmed by the tips we\u2019ve received,\u201d Debbie Johnson, captain of Longview\u2019s Police Department, recalled. \u201cAnd there\u2019s just less opportunity for crime when neighbors watch out for each other.\u201dThe lesson: When neighbors know one another, and have a conveniently located center where they learn about health and social services, problems are more likely to be noticed by neighbors, teachers, professionals, or the police before they become crises.\u201cI was not a true believer, to be honest,\u201d said Brickey. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been amazed time and again at how the neighborhood has responded. I\u2019ve begun to see a neighborhood association as another kind of infrastructure, like the streets, water or sewer system. The health of a neighborhood is just as dependent on it.\u201dThe funding arranged to hire Haeck ran out in 2012, and since then, the neighborhood association has lost some momentum, residents say. \u201cI\u2019m concerned because some of those successes could go by the wayside unless the community finds a way to reignite the passion,\u201d said Brickey. \u201cThey\u2019re not quite ready to stand by themselves.\u201d\u201cSo many people who are living in poverty don\u2019t believe they are capable of anything,\u201d said Haeck. \u201cThis work is all about helping people to recognize that they are capable of great things, and helping them accomplish them.\u201dSince 2013, calls to the police are up again. But the higher reports may also reflect more comfort with the police and less willingness to turn a blind eye to problems, Haeck said, whether it\u2019s teenage drug use in the park or an unattended baby crying in the house across the street.\u201cI was frightened of meeting new people, because of my past,\u201d said Patricia Thompson, who is a member of the neighborhood association\u2019s board. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of people hurt me, but I\u2019m done living in a cave. People like Liz gave me the heart to help other people, and helped me learn how to help. It\u2019s a process. You can\u2019t change your neighborhood overnight.\u201d\u201cPeople can make a difference,\u201d Hite added. \u201cI got hope not only for myself but for all the neighbors. The way is to bring people together and make them stronger. That\u2019s what moves mountains.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Kashmiri Faces Sedition Charges Over Facebook Activity", "Date": "2016-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 The police in central India have charged a man with sedition, a colonial-era offense that can result in life imprisonment, based on Facebook content he shared or posted calling for India to withdraw from the Himalayan region of Kashmir.The man, Tauseef Ahmad Bhat, 29, a Kashmiri engineer working at a mobile phone company in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh, was arrested on Wednesday, accused of \u201cliking, sharing and posting anti-India content on Facebook,\u201d said Amresh Mishra, superintendent of the police in the district where the arrest occurred.A formal complaint brought by the police said a post on Mr. Bhat\u2019s Facebook page had called for India to withdraw from Kashmir, which is divided between India and Pakistan, and had shown the flags of China and Pakistan flying in the background, as well as masked men holding black flags.Another post, the complaint said, displayed a caricature of a hand with a broom, shooing away a mouse rendered in the colors of the Indian flag, with the caption, \u201cGet out from Kashmir.\u201d The complaint also said that Mr. Bhat had posted material critical of Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India.Mr. Mishra, who oversaw the arrest on Wednesday after bringing the complaint on Tuesday night, said that the charges were based solely on Mr. Bhat\u2019s Facebook posts and that Mr. Bhat \u201cwas not found to be involved in any other activity.\u201d He said that \u201ccertain members of civil society\u201d had identified the Facebook posts and reported them to the police.\u201cThese things are and may be normal in Kashmir, but not in this part of the country,\u201d he said.Mr. Bhat could not be reached for comment.Mr. Mishra said that Mr. Bhat, who has a master\u2019s degree in engineering, was apprehended on a train headed for the city of Jammu, in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. He said that the train was stopped after it crossed into a neighboring state and that Mr. Bhat was brought back to Chhattisgarh.The arrest was prompted by activists from a right-wing Hindu group, the Bajrang Dal. They were scouring social media on Tuesday evening, looking for content harmful to India\u2019s image, when they came across Mr. Bhat\u2019s posts, according to Ratan Yadav, 42, coordinator of the organization in the area.\u201cI immediately instructed my local workers, the young lovers of Hinduism, to do one thing: take screenshots,\u201d Mr. Yadav said. \u201cMr. Bhat has abused the army, the police and India in the posts that he has liked and shared.\u201d\u201cHe has been abusive of the thing\u201d that matters most, Mr. Yadav said, \u201cBharat Mata, or Mother India.\u201dMr. Mishra said that the activists \u201chave a right to protest\u201d and that he filed the complaint against Mr. Bhat on Tuesday night.The law against sedition, which the British colonial administration introduced in India, can be used against anyone who \u201cbrings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite dissatisfaction towards, the government established by law.\u201dThe Constitution protects freedom of speech and expression but with exceptions, among them speech that undermines \u201cthe sovereignty and integrity of India.\u201d Governments in the country have broadly used sedition charges, often for political gain. In 2012, a cartoonist was charged with sedition for posting a satirical drawing on a website. In 2015, the Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional one statute used against him, section 66a of the IT Act, which made it a criminal act to post offensive material using the internet.Sedition, however, remains on the books in India, as it does \u201cacross post-colonial Asia,\u201d said Karuna Nundy, a Supreme Court lawyer who argued and won the case striking down section 66a. \u201cThey are batons that independent governments in India, Pakistan, Malaysia, Singapore and many other countries decided to keep.\u201dShe added that the reasoning used to strike down section 66a, which distinguished advocacy from incitement and warned against the \u201cchilling effect\u201d of an overbroad law, applies equally to sedition.Mr. Yadav, the Hindu activist, said that Mr. Bhat, whom he does not know but has tracked on Facebook, \u201cformed a group of Kashmiris and, while living on Indian soil, he is talking of dividing India.\u201d\u201cAnti-India activities have gone up on social media of late, and Kashmiris are using it to the hilt to further an anti-India agenda,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are keeping watch.\u201dHe added that his organization had mobilized to \u201csave cows from the Muslims and whoever else might be smuggling or slaughtering them\u201d and that it had ensured \u201cthe culprits are punished.\u201dSuhasini Raj reported from New Delhi, and Ellen Barry from Bangalore, India.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "A group of photographs from the 1940s and 1950s, thought to be from an Oklahoma photo studio, show white people in a range of situations: awkward portraits, basketball teams and ballroom dancers, people at work, in church, at leisure, even a dead man in an open coffin.These black-and-white images elicited a range of reactions when they were exhibited last year by the artist Pete Mauney at the Teaching Gallery of Hudson Valley Community College in Troy, N.Y. To some visitors, they elicited feelings of nostalgia. To others, their carefree racial homogeneity and lack of diversity \u00e2\u0080\u0094 unremarkable at the time they were taken in Woodward, Okla. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 were disconcerting. A continuing exploration of the relationship of race to photographic portrayals of race by the professor and curator Maurice Berger.Given these fraught political times, the title of Mr. Mauney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fascinating work \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009cBetween the Storms\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 today triggers a range of meanings, both meteorological and racial. These photographs represent the calm between two actual storms: Woodward was twice devastated by tornadoes, one in 1947, another in 2012. But metaphorically, they speak to two other historic and opposing \u00e2\u0080\u009cstorms\u00e2\u0080\u009d: the virulent segregation that took root in much of the nation, including Oklahoma, after Reconstruction, and the rise of the modern civil rights movement. The images represent the last gasp of unregulated, rampant and legal segregation, when white Americans were unconcerned about the lack of diversity in their lives, and when black lives were perpetually battered by racial indifference, bigotry and violence. Today, the Republican presidential nominee promises to \u00e2\u0080\u009cmake America great again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which some political analysts see as a code phrase for turning back the clock on the demographic shifts and multiculturalism that are drastically altering the nation. In this context, Mr. Mauney does something unusual for a white artist: He explores the stark reality of race relations, not through the eyes of its victims but rather through the lens of whiteness, establishing it as a race in need of examination. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBetween the Storms\u00e2\u0080\u009d subtly asks its white viewers to confront what many typically refuse to even acknowledge: the lack of diversity in their lives, and the ease with which they, then and now, foster myriad forms of de facto segregation and racist attitudes and behavior. Yet there are people who still believe that discussions about racism must be initiated by people of color. Implicit in many white liberals\u00e2\u0080\u0099 idealization of Barack Obama in the Democratic presidential primaries of 2008, for example, was the notion that he could bestow upon white America racial \u00e2\u0080\u009catonement and redemption,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as the writer and political activist Barbara Ehrenreich concluded at the time. Those expectations ignore an abiding truth: Only white people can resolve the problem of their own prejudice. Cultural observers and scholars began to explore the idea of \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhiteness\u00e2\u0080\u009d as a racial concept in the late 1980s. To be white in America was to possess a kind of default race that was so dominant and normative that it did not need to be named, let alone examined. These scholars noted that white racism would have no possibility of cure until white people themselves honestly and scrutinized their own race, its attendant privileges and power, and their anxieties, fears and biases about people of color. As unmindful as some white people are about the social rewards of their own color, they remain guardedly aware of the presence of people of color. Vulnerable in a society that often fears and stigmatizes them, African-Americans cannot help but appraise the status of their blackness in relation to the prejudice they encounter daily. Ultimately, talking about these issues frankly \u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially admitting personal biases \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is, for many, confusing, difficult, self-incriminating or embarrassing, especially for people who see themselves as being of open minds and good will, and thus incapable of harboring racist attitudes. In this regard, the very culture that excludes people of color, perpetuates racism and underwrites white privilege can also alter racial perceptions by demonstrating the value of white self-inquiry. Yet such examinations remain extremely rare. Indeed, in American culture, the vast majority of important work about race is created by artists of color. Nevertheless, white artists have done powerful work about race: Lillian Smith\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 1949 book, \u00e2\u0080\u009cKillers of the Dream,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which scrutinized the racism of white Southerners through personal recollections and meticulous analysis, established the idea of transcending bigotry through honest self-inquiry. Or \u00e2\u0080\u009cFar From Heaven,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Todd Haynes\u00e2\u0080\u0099s magisterial 2002 film about an emotional affair between an upper-middle-class white housewife, betrayed by her closeted gay husband, and her black gardener, which showed a love doomed by the passive-aggressive racial politics of a staid Connecticut town in the 1950s.Some of the best work on the subject has been made by white photographers and photo-based visual artists: Marc Asnin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stark examination of skinhead culture and white supremacy; Wendy Ewald\u00e2\u0080\u0099s collaborative portraits, including a white girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 alphabet that revealed the unconscious racial superiority of some of its subjects; Gillian Laub\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cSouthern Rites,\u00e2\u0080\u009d photographs and a documentary film that exposed the de facto segregation of a contemporary Georgia town and its troubled and sometimes violent attempt to reintegrate; and \u00e2\u0080\u009cMemory Flash,\u00e2\u0080\u009d by the collective John-Q, a series of performances, interventions and installations based on archival photographs, film and ephemera that investigated the complex intersection of race and gay and lesbian sexuality in Atlanta. Once again, we find ourselves as a nation between two cultural storms: the period, commencing in the 1970s, when ideas of pluralism, multiculturalism and diversity took hold and the dawn of a demographically transformed America in which the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s white majority \u00e2\u0080\u0094 at times shaken by fear and resentment \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is inevitably becoming a minority. This reality makes honest racial self-inquiry and analysis of whiteness even more urgent. In this regard, photographers and artists of all races \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who are often at the cutting edge of new ideas about society and culture \u00e2\u0080\u0094 must help us to navigate rough waters. Maurice Berger is a research professor and the chief curator at the Center for Art, Design and Visual Culture at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County."}

{"Headline": "Trump Tower Climber Now Faces Charges", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "Supported byIn a city full of marquee buildings and landmarks under constant watch, it is just one among many. But as the primary residence of the Republican nominee in the midst of a heated presidential campaign, Trump Tower holds a particularly high-profile perch.The police said they received a 911 call about the climb shortly after it began around 3:30 p.m. When they came upon Mr. Rogata, he was already five stories up, using power-grip suction cups and what appeared to be a harness to aid his ascent.On Thursday, Mr. Rogata was still at Bellevue Hospital Center, where he was taken for an evaluation after he was detained, the police said.At Trump Tower that day, four police officers, including two from a counterterrorism unit, surveyed the premises. Two private security guards stood in the lobby as tourists flowed in and out. At least seven cameras dotted the lobby and the building\u2019s exterior, in addition to those on nearby buildings and traffic lights along Fifth Avenue.A spokesman for the New York Police Department said Trump Tower had at least one police officer posted there every day, an assignment created as the election cycle has picked up during the last year. The Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment.But in a social-media-saturated world, the stunts and the outrageous images they often generate have the potential to grab attention more quickly than ever. One video stream of the Trump Tower climb, posted on Facebook, drew about 5.8 million views, with a majority of those from people tuning in while the climb was in progress.\u201cIt\u2019s so much easier to get your message out and do it live,\u201d said Glenn Corbett, a professor of security, fire and emergency management at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. \u201cBack then all you got was the nightly news.\u201dThe developer Douglas Durst spoke about the two climbers who scaled The New York Times Building on the same day in 2008. He said he had taken steps at two of his buildings \u2014 Via 57, a 32-story residential building on the West Side of Manhattan, as well as 1 World Trade Center \u2014 to discourage climbers. At Via, on 57th Street near the West Side Highway, an overhang was designed for the base of the building instead of the angular walls reaching down to the sidewalk that were initially planned.\u201cWe\u2019re now very aware of having to design buildings so they are not scalable,\u201d Mr. Durst said.Security experts described the challenge of securing large buildings as a constant push, one that involved sufficient staffing in addition to shrewd design.\u201cThere\u2019s always going to be people who are going to try to steal and commit assault, and climb buildings,\u201d said Mark Lerner, the president of Epic Security Corporation, which provides security for more than 100 buildings in New York City. \u201cYou need the proper security and personnel to act as a deterrent.\u201dThe police said Mr. Rogata told them the brazen stunt had a simple purpose: He wanted to meet Mr. Trump, a motivation that he laid out in a YouTube video that was posted before the climb. A spokeswoman for the police said they believed he had \u201csome type of mental disorder.\u201dTourists strolled by the tower on Thursday, with some stopping to snap selfies in front of it.Richard Monacchio, 50, who was in town with his 14-year-old son to see a Broadway show, said he decided to visit the tower after watching the video stream.\u201cI\u2019m surprised security didn\u2019t start running out immediately,\u201d Mr. Monacchio said of the stunt. Still, he added about Mr. Rogata,\u201cI was hoping he would make it.\u201dCharles V. Bagli and Samantha Schmidt contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Giants Gobble Start-Ups in an Antitrust Blind Spot", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorLike Facebook\u2019s acquisition of WhatsApp, the Walmart deal will probably end up being another example of an upstart internet company being swallowed up to preserve the stranglehold of a giant.This happens because antitrust regulators are stuck in an outdated view of the world, while the internet giants are more attuned to their nascent competitive threats. The deal for Jet.com is just the latest defensive internet acquisition of an emerging start-up that will preserve the hegemony of a select few.And now it is being swallowed up by Walmart.This could be seen as a victory for competition. Walmart will now have a more dynamic management and brand to buttress its own internet sales operation, which trails Amazon by quite a distance. This will allow it to better compete against Amazon. The likely result is that competition in online retailing will eventually be a slugfest between Amazon and Walmart with everyone else thrown by the wayside.The problem with this narrative is that it cements the positions of Walmart and Amazon as the only players in town.This is the modus operandi of the big internet behemoths. They live in fear of new technology disrupting their businesses and killing them off.Mr. Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez was a Facebook product manager when the company faced its greatest threat: Google Plus. Facebook won because it enforced an ethos of all work, all the time, spurred by constant fear of extinction.Facebook and its elite brethren will do anything to make sure they are not the next Yahoo or Radio Shack, killed by disruption and failure to innovate. This translates into paying obscene sums for technology that might challenge their dominance one day.If you don\u2019t believe this, there is a poignant passage in \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d where Mr. Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez notes that Mark Zuckerberg saw that there were two companies with \u201chockey stick growth\u201d that matched Facebook\u2019s own: Instagram and WhatsApp. Both were amassing users at an amazing rate and both were an existential threat to Facebook.Did Mr. Zuckerberg rev up the Facebook machine to try to outcompete them? No. Instead, he bought Instagram for about $1 billion and WhatsApp for an astounding $21.8 billion.Today, Facebook is dominant, with more than 1.7 billion monthly active users. WhatsApp has more than 1 billion monthly active users and Instagram, more than 500 million.Another Google example is YouTube, which was bought for $1.65 billion in 2006 and is now a constant stream of users for Google. Indeed, YouTube, with more than one billion active monthly users, is a top driver of Alphabet\u2019s user growth.Billions of dollars are made in Silicon Valley by selling nascent upstarts to the giants. And the dominant players pay eagerly to remain dominant. That is what is going on with the Jet.com acquisition and perhaps even the $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn by Microsoft.Where are the antitrust authorities in all of this? The guiding standard under the law is that no acquisition should be allowed if it would \u201clessen competition.\u201dUnder the traditional view of antitrust, when Facebook, for example, tries to buy a company like Instagram, it can argue that anyone can start such a website. And there are other competitors like Google and Snapchat. And so this gets past the antitrust authorities, who seem more concerned with how the data will be used rather than the accumulation of users. Both United States and European Union regulators examined the WhatsApp deal, but it passed muster because WhatsApp was viewed as a messenger service, something where there was alternative competition.This misses the point that domination is all about users and views. Those companies with users and page views can dominate, and accumulating those users is everything, something only an infinitesimally small number of companies can find the key to doing.The antitrust system results in the increasing oligopoly that we have, where a few companies dominate major industries, accruing the wealth and power that go with it as potential disrupters are swallowed at birth, the way Cronus, the titan in Greek mythology, ate his young to prevent their uprising.No one knows what might happen to Jet if it remained independent. Perhaps it would fail. Amazon is dominant and Walmart may truly be the only real competitor. The same could be said of any of these acquisitions of high-growth companies. So preventing this acquisition may result not in creating a competitor to Amazon but in the eventual death of Jet. This of course would leave its founder and investors much poorer, a true cost.The flip side of this risk is that the big tech companies continue unchallenged in their dominance. Perhaps it is time to rethink antitrust enforcement, and take the risks associated with a different view of antitrust that looks at potential dominance and at breaking up oligopolies.

{"Headline": "Stephen Harper, Former Prime Minister of Canada, Quits Politics", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "Supported byIn the video, recorded in what appeared to be a boardroom with two Canadian flags behind him, Mr. Harper offers no indication of his plans after politics, though several Canadian news outlets reported that he intended to open a consulting business with some of his former political aides.In his brief farewell on Friday, Mr. Harper offered a modest list of achievements. He said that his government had introduced tax cuts, balanced its budget (though that was not the case for most of his tenure), \u201cgot tough on crime and put families first\u201d and \u201ctook principled decisions in a complex and dangerous world.\u201dHe particularly highlighted that Canada was less affected by the 2008 global recession than other nations were. Some economists and political analysts attribute that at least in part to the effect of regulations that Mr. Harper had intended to relax or eliminate.No one disputes Mr. Harper\u2019s success in reuniting what had become a fragmented conservative moment in Canada, which brought the country\u2019s center-right a long period in power.In 2003, as the leader of the Canadian Alliance, which began as a protest party in Western Canada, Mr. Harper helped engineer a merger with the venerable but much diminished Progressive Conservative Party, whose roots traced back to Sir John A. Macdonald, Canada\u2019s first prime minister.\u201cHe\u2019s gone, but the party will go on,\u201d Dimitry Anastakis, a historian at Trent University in Peterborough, Ontario, said of Mr. Harper. \u201cThat\u2019s a testament to his shrewdness.\u201dRaymond B. Blake, a historian at the University of Regina in Saskatchewan, said that the fairly limited list of achievements stems from Mr. Harper\u2019s belief in small government and his decisions to turn more power over to provincial governments.\u201cHis mantra was: We will leave money in the hands of people and leave them to decide how to spend it,\u201d Professor Blake said.Stephanie Bangarth, a political historian at the University of Western Ontario, said Mr. Harper \u201cwas successful in moving Canadians to thinking of themselves as taxpayers, and their relationship with government as transactional, although you can now see Trudeau trying to change that.\u201dWhile in office, Mr. Harper controversially rolled back the powers of several regulatory agencies, or replaced their leaders with people who shared his small-government philosophy. Some programs, like a registry for rifles and shotguns and mandatory census participation, were scrapped. Public servants were severely restricted in their freedom to speak publicly.That was particularly true of scientists working on the issue of climate change, who were generally barred from speaking to reporters and frequently were not allowed to address scientific meetings.Mr. Harper, who was fiercely partisan, consolidated power in the prime minister\u2019s office, and twice suspended Parliament to avoid votes that might have put his government out of power.He carried over that aggressive style to international relations. As an unabashed champion of Alberta\u2019s oil industry, Mr. Harper tried hard to persuade the Obama administration to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have carried production from the province\u2019s oil sands to the refineries on the gulf coast of the United States. But his repeated lectures to Americans only brought a rejection of the plan from President Obama.Mr. Harper avoided holding news conferences. When he did speak publicly, his presentations were often uninspired. But for much of his time in office, that didn\u2019t matter. A dull but apparently hardworking prime minister struck many voters as preferable to the leadership turmoil and the even less inspirational figures at the head of the Liberal opposition.During the election campaign last year against the charismatic, if unproven, Mr. Trudeau, Conservative television ads showed Mr. Harper working hard late at night, the last person in the office.But Professor Blake said that Mr. Harper\u2019s lack of charm ultimately overshadowed his policies.\u201cHe was cold and distant,\u201d Professor Blake said. \u201cHe never made Canadians feel good about their country.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated, at one point, the month that federal elections were held in 2015. As noted correctly elsewhere in the article, it was October, not November.Advertisement"}

There are millions of ordinary Americans who have been let down, who have had a bad time, who feel the political class in Washington is detached from them, who feel so many of their representatives are politically correct parts of that liberal media elite.\u201dHe continued, \u201cYou can go out, you can beat the pollsters, you can beat the commentators, you can beat Washington.\u201dYou can\u2019t have observed Farage over the past couple of years and not think Trump may well win in November. That\u2019s Britain\u2019s lesson to America. There is too much smug Hillary-has-it sentiment swilling around.Farage proved pollsters wrong. He proved commentators wrong. He made a mockery of President Obama and others who urged Britain to remain in Europe. He delivered something as unthinkable as Trump\u2019s rise to the Republican nomination: a winning popular insurrection against the status quo, in this case the European Union membership that had undergirded growing British prosperity for more than four decades.The thing is, the prosperity was skewed, just as it\u2019s skewed in the United States, leaving wide swathes of the white working class in particular incensed that employment has migrated offshore at the same speed as immigrants have come onshore to take a dwindling number of jobs.Britain, too, has its miniature version of flyover country now. The global citizens of big cities like London and Manchester who voted Remain were aghast that anyone out there in Lincolnshire (let alone a majority nationwide) could think differently, in the same way as the global citizens of New York or Los Angeles can\u2019t see Trump\u2019s appeal to tens of millions of Americans.The uncomfortable truth about the Trump campaign is that, like the Brexit campaign, it is perfectly timed to ride a mood of popular revolt \u2014 against neoliberal economics, against the bankers who emerged with impunity from the 2008 financial meltdown, against what Farage called \u201cglobal corporatism,\u201d against seemingly uncontrolled immigration, and against the politicians behind growing workplace precariousness and a pervasive sense of personal control lost to impersonal forces.One way to view Trump is that only his personal failings \u2014 his bullying, his petulance, his egomania, his ignorance, his inconsistency, his mendacity, his racism, his hair-trigger temper, his arrogance, his disorganization and his misogyny \u2014 stand in the way of his emerging as the logical victor in an anti-status quo, pro-change election that produced in Bernie Sanders the other political phenomenon of 2016.Because Hillary Clinton, as a symbol of dynastic entitlement (albeit a female one), is such an easy target for an anti-establishment movement, she is particularly vulnerable to the forces that have produced Trump and Brexit.He went on: \u201cOne of the reasons why the left has failed to emerge as the leader of the new mood of working-class disillusionment is that most social democratic parties became, in varying degrees, disciples of neoliberalism and uber-globalization.\u201d The most extreme expressions of this, he noted, were New Labour in Britain and the Democratic Party, led respectively by Tony Blair and Bill Clinton.Of course, those political movements also produced great prosperity and optimism in their moment. But the moment has passed. The pendulum has swung. Inequality has risen to intolerable levels.\u201cIf the little people, if the real people, if the ordinary decent people are prepared to stand up and fight for what they believe in, we can overcome the big banks, we can overcome the multinationals,\u201d Farage declared with Trump looking on approvingly.They are politicians delivering ugly messages \u2014 explicit and implicit. Theirs is the last hate-filled stand of the white man in societies that globalization has irrevocably changed in composition and color. They are self-centered and cynical, manipulating resentment with half-truths and untruths, accommodating the loony extremist right.Farage has already done great damage to Britain. But if there is one thing that Americans can learn from him, it is that we live in an age where the candidate of disruption rides a powerful wave.Advertisement"}

Fashion is an industry continually redefined by trends \u2014 inspiration is the oxygen, while creativity is the heartbeat. That inspiration can be found on social media\u2019s open forums, where bold, creative people show off what they\u2019re wearing and how they're wearing it, prompting rivals, fans and imitators to respond in kind. Check your Instagram, Facebook feed and favorite fashion blog: The results are a visual feast of originality. In Japan \u2014 a country known for avant-garde designers, progressive street style and a seemingly nationwide talent for subverting and initiating trends \u2014 there\u2019s a popular fashion app filled with enough content to satisfy a style-inspiration binge. This app has the captivating here\u2019s-what-the-cool-kids-are-wearing feel of a designer lookbook, as well as the friendly vibes of a family photo album. And the best news? It just arrived in the U.S.It\u2019s called Wear (now available for iOS and Android) and, every day, members of the app\u2019s community of 7 million active users upload more than 7,000 images of themselves dressed according to a daily hashtag (#widelegpants or #whitedenim, for example). They also tag the photos to show the designers represented in their outifts. Yusaku Maezawa, a Tokyo-based billionaire who recently added a $57 million painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat to his already formidable collection of contemporary art, launched the app about three years ago. Maezawa got his start running a modest mail-order business in the 1990s that eventually became the e-commerce giant Zozotown. When Maezawa decided to expand into fashion, he hoped to create an app that\u2019s a democratic setting for users to conduct personal style experiments and share them with a community of like-minded innovators. \u201cIt\u2019s an expression of the poster\u2019s individuality through the designers and brands they choose and how their style is assembled,\u201d says Masahiro Ito, CEO of engineering for Start Today, the parent company of Wear and Zozotown. \u201cIt speaks to who they are, while at the same time creating something that resonates with others. Fashion always has an aspirational aspect to it, and Wear can be a great source for finding new inspiration.\u201dThe \u201cBack to Cool\u201d theme for this month\u2019s set of T\u00a0Brand Studio hashtags invites users to curate outfits that work for late summer into fall, when days are still warm but evening temperatures can dip. Blogger Lindsay Marcella (read more about her in the Wear It\u2019s At profile) says her strategy for transitional season dressing involves mixing cool-off pieces like blouses with cutout-back blouses and strappy sandals with cool-weather elements like denim and chunky sweaters. Fellow blogger Denny Balmaceda, also profiled, relies on jackets and a collection of 25 hats to layer up and down.

{"Headline": "An Epidemic of \u2018Dead Eyes\u2019 in Kashmir as India Uses Pellet Guns on Protesters", "Date": "2016-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySRINAGAR, Kashmir \u2014 The street outside is patrolled by riot police officers in camouflage, bracing for the nightly spasm of violence, but it is quiet here inside the operating room. The surgeon\u2019s knife slides into an eyeball as if it were a soft fruit.The patient\u2019s eyelids have been stretched back with a metal clamp, so his eyeball bulges out of glistening pink tissue. The surgeon sits with his back very straight, cutting with tiny movements of his fingers. Every now and then, a thread of blood appears in the patient\u2019s eye socket. The patient is 8 years old.\u201cVery bad,\u201d murmurs the surgeon, Dr. S. Natarajan. But then, all 13 cases he will see today will be very bad.Since mid-July, when the current wave of protests against the Indian military presence started, more than 570 patients have reported to Srinagar\u2019s main government hospital with eyes ruptured by lead pellets, sometimes known as birdshot, fired by security forces armed with pump-action shotguns to disperse crowds.The patients have mutilated retinas, severed optic nerves, irises seeping out like puddles of ink. \u201cDead eyes,\u201d the ophthalmology department\u2019s chief calls them.Every season of popular revolt in Kashmir has its marker.This summer\u2019s protests in the part of Kashmir controlled by India, the most sustained and violent since 2010, caught the authorities in New Delhi unaware. The stone-throwing crowds have no political leaders, put forward no specific demands and metastasized with alarming speed. Around 60 civilians and two members of the security forces have been killed; on each side, thousands have been wounded.But 2016 will almost certainly be remembered as the year of dead eyes. The eye injuries have become such a focus of public anger that last week, in a conciliatory gesture, India\u2019s home minister, Rajnath Singh, promised that the pellet guns, as they are known here, would be replaced by another type of nonlethal weapon in the coming days.\u201cThat 8-year-old boy, he will live for 70 or 80 years,\u201d says the doctor, Afroz Khan. \u201cThe history remains there, even if it is not in the books.\u201dOn July 9, Tariq Qureshi, the head of the ophthalmology department, was at a seminar on pediatric retinal repair.It was the hospital emergency room, calling to let him know that two patients had come in with pellets in their eyes. Dr. Qureshi sent a doctor over, and the seminar resumed. Ten minutes later, the phone rang again. It was the same doctor in the emergency room, telling Dr. Qureshi to come immediately, that the number of patients had risen to 15.The four ophthalmologists, who were across the hospital campus from the emergency room, ran.For the next 72 hours, they operated in shifts around the clock, suturing the eyes to keep the matter inside from leaking out. In most cases, it became clear, the pellets had burst into through the cornea and out through the retina, leaving little hope of fully restoring vision. Twenty-seven patients were hit in both eyes. The pellets, when they could be removed, were preserved on the heads of cotton swabs.\u201cOnce it goes in the eye, it rotates like this, and destroys everything there inside,\u201d Dr. Qureshi said. \u201cIt\u2019s physics. This is a high-velocity body. It releases a high amount of energy inside. The lens, the iris, the retina get matted up.\u201dThe doctors were told to take all possible measures to save their patients\u2019 vision, including complex surgery, at a cost to the government of 70,000 rupees, or around $1,040, per operation, Dr. Qureshi said.He works in a bubble of calm, eyes pressed to a microscope, using his hands to work a cutter and a light, and using his bare feet to control the machines that surround him. On a screen opposite him is an image captured by a microscopic camera inside the boy\u2019s eye. At times the image is cloudy, a flashlight searching in the fog; at one point there are swimming glints of colored light, like those cast by a chandelier in the sun.In cases of catastrophic injuries, Dr. Natarajan\u2019s goal is to save a small portion of the eye\u2019s function, enough to sense light, or movement of a hand.\u201cEven that minor change from zero matters a lot, for a man with no light,\u201d Dr. Natarajan said. \u201cIt is like, if you have no money in your pocket, 10 rupees seems like big money.\u201dSlowly, as residents stood around him in hushed silence, the surgeon flattened out the boy\u2019s retina, as thin and delicate as a lace doily, and used a laser to reattach it to the back of his eye.For an Indian security official, to be engulfed by a hostile crowd in Kashmir is, without a doubt, a life-threatening situation.At sunset on Friday, Bhavesh Chaudhary, the second-in-command of the 161st Battalion of the Central Reserve Police Force, was drinking tea in the camp garden when an officer called with the news that 20 or 30 young men had begun to gather, chanting slogans. He continued drinking tea. The crowd outside kept growing.Then, all of a sudden, Commandant Chaudhary and his troops strapped on helmets and leapt into a column of armored vehicles. As they raced through the neighborhood, masked boys appeared from the left and the right, darting out of alleyways, hurling stones. The troops sent stones rocketing back with small slingshots. The convoy halted at an intersection. Chanting could be heard, coming closer: \u201cWhat do we want? Freedom!\u201dCommandant Chaudhary would spend the next hour and a half trying to push the crowd back. His troops may be heavily armed, but especially at sunset, when they withdraw to their encampments for the night, it is clear to everyone that they are outnumbered.On the streets of Srinagar, which have a ghostly emptiness after 50 days of curfew, people have scrawled, \u201cIndian dogs,\u201d \u201cGo India, go back,\u201d \u201cWe love Pakistan\u201d and \u201cBurhan is alive in our hearts.\u201dCommandant Chaudhary has dedicated much of his career to battling stone-throwing crowds. He knows the current of excitement that will surge through them if they see his forces retreat even a few feet \u2014 or, more powerfully, if they see an officer fall. If the stone-throwers managed to reach the camp, he said, they would set it on fire.\u201cThey are not afraid, that is the thing,\u201d he said of the protesters. \u201cOnce somebody has put on a uniform and picked up a weapon, the law should be maintained, just because the person is there. That is not happening these days. We lost that in 2010.\u201dIndian troops use pellet guns for crowd control only in Kashmir. They were introduced in 2010, halfway through a particularly bloody season of protest. Pellet guns have been used to break up protests in Egypt, Bahrain and Tunisia, but most countries do not use them on unarmed civilians, as the pellets spray widely and cannot be aimed. For Commandant Chaudhary, who sometimes faces crowds of more than 1,000 hostile young men with a contingent of 20 or 30, it is by far the most effective weapon at his disposal.\u201cIt causes bodily injury, so you will be feared,\u201d he said.His battalion commander, Rajesh Yadav, nodded at this assessment. \u201cIf you pinch them,\u201d he said, \u201conly then people will understand.\u201dThis year, the use of pellets on Kashmiri protesters increased sharply, with the police firing more than 3,000 canisters, or upward of 1.2 million pellets, in the first 32 days of the protests, the Central Reserve Police Force has said.Though troops are instructed to aim them below the waist, \u201csometimes it is difficult to go in for precise aimed fire at a moving, bending and running target,\u201d the police explained in response to a lawsuit seeking to ban their use. If they are withdrawn from the arsenal, Commander Yadav said matter-of-factly, troops will have to use their firearms.As for the government hospital, now jammed with injured protesters and sympathetic volunteers, Commander Yadav said it was no longer a safe place for his officers to go. Not long ago, one of his men sought medical help for chest pain but fled in fear of being lynched.In a recovery ward at Shri Maharaja Hari Singh Hospital, a nurse pushes a trolley down a row of beds, distributing cups of tea and slices of white bread to a row of young men in sunglasses.To converse with them is to see new energy coursing into Kashmir\u2019s old cycle of violence. It is difficult to find a patient here who admits to mourning the loss of his eye. They say it is an acceptable price to pay for azadi, or freedom from Indian rule. Quite a few offer to sacrifice their second eye for the cause.Wazira Banwo, 40, is watching her 8-year-old son, Asif Sheikh, recover from surgery. The boy is curled on his side under a blanket, his head swathed in surgical gauze, woozy and sick. It was his third operation; now, with his retina reattached, he may be able to see for a distance of three to five feet, according to Dr. Natarajan.Asked whether she was grateful to the government for providing the child medical care, Ms. Banwo grimaces.\u201cNot a single person from the government has come to help,\u201d she says. \u201cIf any one of them come to me, I will tell them, \u2018You give me your eyes, I will put them in my child.\u2019\u201dMs. Banwo says she often participated in anti-Indian protests herself but discouraged Asif from taking part this summer because of his youth.On the day he was injured, she says, he just happened to be standing in the market when security forces arrived in a van and fired pellet guns.\u201cThis time he is very young,\u201d she says. \u201cBut he will grow. He will understand what happened to him. And he will go out to the street and throw stones.\u201dHari Kumar contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

It probably starts with a commitment to sticking to your budget, and you do for a few days. Then, despite your resolve, you break down, pull out the credit card and do something that you promised you wouldn\u2019t. You wake up in the morning ashamed and resolve never to do it again.Then you repeat.Been there? Done that?Frustrated, you wonder what\u2019s wrong. You\u2019re smart, you\u2019re successful, and when you set your mind to something, you\u2019re able to do it.I think we can all relate. If not money, insert food. So what can we do about this problem of knowing we should act one way but repeatedly doing something different?The answer lies in understanding the relationship between the stimulus to do something, how we respond and a little secret I\u2019ll share in a minute.But first, here\u2019s the problem as I see it: Almost all personal finance advice focuses on controlling the stimulus or your response to it. Gurus tell you to stop looking at Instagram, stay off Facebook, fire all your nonfrugal friends and disown your spendthrift family members. That is an effort to control the stimulus.Then, you\u2019re told to control your response. Most of this advice centers on making it painful to spend. Cut up your credit cards. Use only cash. Track, review and feel bad about your spending.It works until it doesn\u2019t anymore. You can\u2019t ignore all the voices screaming at you to spend, and making spending painful increases the feelings of shame when we do something wrong. It only leads to more spending as a form of self-medicating.Whoa! There is a third element to this little dance with stimulus and response. To break this frustrating spending cycle, we can focus on creating space between the two of them.It starts by acknowledging that the space exists. Most of us don\u2019t even know it\u2019s there. We see a Twitter post about a book someone likes, the post has a link to Amazon, we click the \u201cone click buy\u201d button, and then we own a book with little to no thought.So we need to practice pausing once we\u2019re in that space between. The advice to use cash or to lock up the credit cards can be useful here if it creates space between our desire to buy and our actual buying. It can also be as simple as training ourselves to notice the desire. How does it feel to want something?I didn\u2019t need to bar myself from reading book reviews or allow myself to buy books only with cash. By adding a little space, I gave myself the opportunity to change my response. How you add space is up to you, but once you get good at creating it, then some of the other things matter less.This is just one simple trick to create space. I think you\u2019ll find that by focusing on the space between, you can let go of your anxious grasp on the stimulus and response. If you get the space right, the other two take care of themselves.I\u2019d love to hear from you. What have you done to create space? How has it helped you?Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of an Austrian psychiatrist on second reference.

Ms. Greenwood\u2019s research reveals that death fraud is a \u201cheavily male phenomenon.\u201d Men looking to disappear tend to have money problems; when it\u2019s women, they tend to have violent-man problems.Some of the fundamental tasks on the offing-yourself checklist are more easily accomplished than you might think. For instance: producing a body. A relatively robust number of morgues are in the sales business, especially in places where corpse security is a low priority. Steve Rambam, a fraud investigator, is quoted as saying: \u201cYou can just go into any city morgue in almost any developing country, ask to see the unclaimed bodies, and cry, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s poor Uncle Marco!\u2019 They\u2019ll be happy to get a body off their hands.\u201dEven Ms. Greenwood\u2019s suspicion that technology makes the job harder isn\u2019t that simple. \u201cThe internet is a double-edged sword,\u201d Mr. Ahearn tells her. \u201cIt all comes down to who\u2019s better at it: the person looking or the person disappearing?\u201dThe book\u2019s centerpiece is a profile of John Darwin, a British man who intentionally disappeared while kayaking in 2002, to escape debt and come into insurance money. He resurfaced in 2007, claiming to have amnesia. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to overstate John Darwin\u2019s pop-culture cachet in the United Kingdom,\u201d Ms. Greenwood writes. She met Mr. Darwin and interviewed him about his plot, and whether he regrets the emotional toll his scheme took on his grown sons, who believed him dead. (Mr. Darwin\u2019s wife was in on the trick.)Less coherent is a chapter on people who believe that Michael Jackson is still among us. While these believers are certainly entertaining \u2014 one of them says, \u201cThis is about Michael trying to stop World War III and the people who continually gain more control over us\u201d; another believes that one of Jackson\u2019s lyrics hints that he would reappear in 2012, at the end of the Mayan calendar \u2014 they belong in a different book. Those who picture the King of Pop, Elvis, Princess Diana and Andy Kaufman having brunch in a diner somewhere are nuts in a qualitatively different way from people who fake their own deaths. Dedicating a long chapter to them in \u201cPlaying Dead,\u201d rather than a few paragraphs, feels like padding.The fun in Greenwood\u2019s book \u2014 much of it admittedly grim fun \u2014 is in learning the details: the method Los Angeles uses to dispose of its 1,500 or so unclaimed bodies each year; the fact that imaginary people were created to have \u201cdied\u201d in the Sept. 11 attacks for insurance purposes; the man who is pulled over for speeding just a few days after \u201cdrowning.\u201d (If you\u2019re in this game, relocate somewhere with public transportation; motor vehicles seem to be the equivalent of Al Capone\u2019s taxes for the fake dead.)The book\u2019s weakness is in its frame. Ms. Greenwood sells us the project as an investigation and survey spurred by her own desire to fake her death. That desire may have been real, but these pages don\u2019t convince us of it. Yes, she was in debt, but never does one sense she actually believed that the momentous consequences and dangers of her decision would be anywhere near worth the corresponding debt relief. Even though she goes far into the process (no spoilers about the Philippines here), the book\u2019s tone would be better served if she more often admitted, as she does in one quick sentence, that her intentions were not particularly earnest. She comes across as simply a writer interested in a fascinating subject, which is enough.Near the end of the book, she runs down several of the most fundamental suggestions in just a few paragraphs that can be taped to the computer screen of anyone doing their own research: Don\u2019t stage a drowning. Most drowning victims eventually wash up somewhere, so when you don\u2019t, eyebrows will be raised. Use your real first name for your new identity.

{"Headline": "The Shadow of Crime in City Parks", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe data add up to less than one crime per day per park, as a New York Police Department spokesman put it, noting that the parks account for a tiny percentage of crime citywide, which at any rate is lower than it has been in decades.In other words, look around: If you can see trees, benches and squirrels, you are safer than practically anywhere else in the city.The Police Department, of course, can never be complacent about preventing violence in a city of more than eight million people that is both one of the world\u2019s top tourist attractions and one of the top potential terrorism targets. It should not ignore the threats that can crop up in unexpected places, even as it focuses enforcement on serious threats like gangs and guns in high-crime precincts.These crimes are all the more frightening because they pierce the sense of security that so many New Yorkers now feel. But as alarming as high-profile crimes can be, it helps to keep sight of the bigger picture. After years of regaining a more peaceable city, street by street and park by park, many New Yorkers have rediscovered the ability to be shocked by crime instead of numbed by it. Stare at an image long enough and you might start to see what you\u2019re looking for, and frighten yourself. The \u201csurge\u201d in crime in the parks is more about fear than facts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Singapore Says It Expects More Zika Cases", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "Supported bySINGAPORE \u2014 Singapore, which has confirmed several dozen cases of the Zika virus in recent days, expects to identify more previously undiagnosed infections as it steps up measures to halt the spread of the mosquito-borne disease, according to the government.The city-state\u2019s Health Ministry said on Tuesday that it had confirmed 82 Zika cases, up from 56 the previous day. \u201cThe Ministry of Health will continue to work with general practitioners in the area to offer testing for patients who had fever and rash previously,\u201d the ministry said in a statement. \u201cThe look-back exercise will likely uncover more previously undiagnosed cases of Zika.\u201dAt least 36 of the people known to have been infected were foreign workers at a construction site in eastern Singapore, the ministry said. It said the government had inspected about 5,000 premises in the city-state\u2019s east, including the construction site, for mosquito breeding habitats.Why scientists are worried about the growing epidemic and its effects on pregnant women, and how to avoid the infection.The World Health Organization has declared an international emergency over Zika, which has been linked to microcephaly, a birth defect in which babies are born with brain damage and abnormally small heads. The virus has spread explosively in Latin American and the Caribbean.Other Southeast Asian countries besides Singapore have reported Zika cases recently, including Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. Some experts believe that the virus has circulated at low levels in tropical regions of Asia for decades. Starting in the 1950s, clusters of cases were detected from Indonesia to Pakistan. But large outbreaks were not detected, partly because routine Zika tests were never developed for public health laboratories, and because Zika resembles mild cases of other mosquito-borne diseases like dengue and chikungunya.Ooi Eng Eong, a professor and deputy director of the Emerging Infectious Diseases Program at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore, said Tuesday that it was not surprising that the virus was in Singapore, since it is spread by the same mosquito that carries dengue, which is a recurrent problem here.\u201cIn the same way that dengue still spreads in Singapore despite dengue control, I will expect more instances of Zika,\u201d Professor Ooi said. \u201cEspecially when data shows very few of us have the immunity against it, compared to dengue.\u201dSingapore confirmed its first locally transmitted Zika case on Saturday, after a 47-year-old Malaysian woman tested positive. Just one day later, the government reported that 41 Zika cases had been confirmed.Opposition politicians, pointing to that sudden increase, questioned whether the government had been upfront with the public about the spread of Zika here. The Workers\u2019 Party, the only elected opposition party with representatives in Singapore\u2019s Parliament, called on Sunday for the government to clarify its timeline for public notification of such cases, and the Singapore Democratic Party said on its website that officials must \u201cstop giving excuses and give Singaporeans timely and complete information.\u201dOn Sunday, Chee Hong Tat, the minister for both health and information, denied that there had been any attempt to conceal the outbreak. \u201cThis is certainly not true,\u201d he wrote on Facebook, adding that the government had been \u201cproactive in engaging the different stakeholders to identify possible cases, conducting screening and testing to identify the confirmed cases, and promptly announcing such cases to the public once they have been confirmed.\u201dLast year, an outbreak of hepatitis C that affected 25 patients at Singapore General Hospital was not made public for months, raising questions about the government\u2019s transparency in reporting threats to public health. Eight of the people had died, though the local news media attributed only seven of the deaths to the virus.The Zika outbreak has also stirred painful memories here of the 2003 epidemic of sudden acute respiratory syndrome, SARS, , which led to 33 deaths in Singapore.\u201cI really hope this Zika hoo-ha is contained soon,\u201d said Low Chee Beng, 38, a self-employed Singaporean. \u201cI don\u2019t want to return to the SARS days when we had to worry about even leaving our home.\u201dAn earlier version of a capsule summary with this article misstated the day on which the government confirmed 82 Zika cases in Singapore.

{"Headline": "With Uzbekistan\u2019s Ruler Gravely Ill, Questions Arise on Succession", "Date": "2016-08-29", "News": "Supported byLater on Monday, Ferghana, an Uzbek website banned at home since 2005, reported that Mr. Karimov had died in the afternoon, citing sources outside the government. The report was widely repeated by independent news outlets in Russia.There was no official confirmation, however, and Russian outlets, such as the state-run RIA Novosti agency, quoted unidentified government officials in Uzbekistan as saying that the president remained alive and in stable condition.The nightly news on the main Uzbekistan television channel did not refer to the story at all, mentioning the president as the active leader.Under the Constitution, upon Mr. Karimov\u2019s death, the head of Uzbekistan\u2019s Senate would run the country for three months to allow for new presidential elections. Presidential elections in Uzbekistan have always come with a known outcome.With no son or obvious successor, the announcement that Mr. Karimov, 78, was gravely ill, or perhaps dead, immediately focused attention on who might succeed him.\u201cThis is the question that worries everybody now,\u201d Mr. Kislov said. No successor is likely to replace the secret police as the central power in the country, he predicted.\u201cIslam Karimov has built a very stable system of power, which is based on the power of the special services,\u201d Mr. Kislov said in an interview. \u201cRegardless of who is the main person in the country, the real power will be with the special services.\u201dAmid the conflicting accounts on Monday, there was no indication of public unrest or even disquiet in Uzbekistan, the largest country in Central Asia by far, with more than 31 million people.The way the announcement was made, however, indicated that Mr. Karimov was in grave condition. For the first time ever, the government issued a statement about his health, reporting on Sunday that the president had been hospitalized without providing any details.Then on Monday, his younger daughter, Lola Karimova-Tillyaeva, 38, the Uzbek ambassador to Unesco in Paris, posted her announcement on Facebook in Uzbek, Russian and English.\u201cI would like to write here about the sad events that befell our family last weekend,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMy father was hospitalized after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage on Saturday morning, and is now receiving treatment in an intensive-care unit.\u201dMs. Karimova-Tillyaeva said that her father was in stable condition and that it was too early for a prognosis. She asked for privacy, prayers and for \u201ceveryone to refrain from any speculation.\u201dThe announcement prompted just that, however, given that Mr. Karimov has avoided appointing a successor.Under investigation in Europe and the United States on suspicion of accepting hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes in connection with telecom licenses in Uzbekistan, Ms. Karimova disappeared from public view.In 2014, it was revealed that she had been under house arrest for at least a year, with various associates arrested and jailed. She remains at home under guard.Mr. Karimov\u2019s wife, Tatyana Karimova, and Rustam Inoyatov, the head of the secret police, are expected to be hugely influential in the choice of a successor, but are unlikely to take such a public role themselves.Prime Minister Shavkat Mirziyoev, seen as a Kremlin ally, is a more likely consensus candidate within a small ruling circle, as is Rustam Azimov, a deputy prime minister and finance minister.Mr. Karimov, first appointed to run Uzbekistan in 1989 when it was still part of the Soviet Union, won an election to continue as president after it collapsed in 1991.The massacre prompted Europe and the United States to distance themselves from Mr. Karimov for a time, and the United States imposed military sanctions. But Uzbekistan was a crucial supplier for Western troops propping up the government in Afghanistan against the Taliban, so ties were restored within a few years and remain stable.\u201cKarimov is known for being one of the wiliest, most ruthless authoritarian rulers, not only in the post-Soviet space but in the entire world,\u201d said Steve Swerdlow, the director of Central Asia research at Human Rights Watch.The stability of Uzbekistan, the crossroads of Central Asia, is important to Russia, China and the United States. Some Uzbeks have turned up among the Islamic State fighters in the Middle East, but they are not considered a serious threat at home.In Moscow, Dmitry S. Peskov, the presidential spokesman, wished Mr. Karimov a speedy recovery. He said it was not appropriate to speculate about the future of the country should Mr. Karimov die, according to the Interfax news agency.Mr. Karimov has kept some distance from Moscow as well as from his neighbors, yet rules in a manner learned from his past as a Soviet official. Every year, for example, an estimated million Uzbeks are forced to leave their regular lives for a month to help with the public cotton harvest.In another annual rite, Mr. Karimov shows up at the public celebrations of independence day on Sept. 1 to glad-hand the crowd and perform a traditional national dance. It is, analysts noted, his way of showing the public that he is in good health.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Affluent and Black, and Still Trapped by Segregation", "Date": "2016-08-20", "News": "Why well-off black families end up living in poorer areas than white families with similar or even lower incomes.Supported byMILWAUKEE \u2014 Their daughter was sick and they needed family around to help care for her, so JoAnne and Maanaan Sabir took an unexpected detour.They had spent years blowing past mileposts: earning advanced degrees and six-figure incomes, buying a 2,500-square-foot Victorian with hardwood floors. Yet here they were, both 37, moving to a corner of town pocked by empty lots, cramming into an apartment above Ms. Sabir\u2019s mother, in the very duplex that Ms. Sabir\u2019s grandparents had bought six decades earlier.Their new dwelling was in a part of the Lindsay Heights neighborhood where more than one in three families lives in poverty; gunshots were too often a part of the nighttime soundtrack. They planned to leave once their daughter, Ameera, was healthy.But then, reminding them of why they feel at home in communities like this one, their new neighbors started frequently checking on Ameera: Is she doing O.K.? And on their son, Taj: When\u2019s his next basketball game? Mr. Sabir\u2019s car stalled in the middle of the street one night, and it was the young men too often stereotyped as suspicious who helped him push it home. So many welcoming black faces like their own, they thought.\u201cIt felt like that\u2019s where we should be,\u201d Ms. Sabir said.It is a national phenomenon challenging the popular assumption that segregation is more about class than about race, that when black families earn more money, some ideal of post-racial integration will inevitably be reached.In fact, a New York Times analysis of 2014 census figures shows that income alone cannot explain, nor would it likely end, the segregation that has defined American cities and suburbs for generations.The result: Nationally, black and white families of similar incomes still live in separate worlds.In many of America\u2019s largest metropolitan areas, including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, black families making $100,000 or more are more likely to live in poorer neighborhoods than even white households making less than $25,000. This is particularly true in areas with a long history of residential segregation, like metropolitan Milwaukee.In one neighborhood on Milwaukee\u2019s predominantly black north side, that means the appearance of a new 4,000-square-foot home owned by a black energy executive and her husband, who host political fund-raisers with valet parking. Nearby, a financial adviser and his wife are stuck in the starter home they bought about 10 years ago, because it lost value and they couldn\u2019t sell it. Up the street, there\u2019s an engineer, living with her family, who said she stayed in the city for its amenities and to send the message, \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to run away.\u201dThe Sabirs share that mix of civic-minded motivation, and limitations. They are successful small-business owners with college degrees, yet even their choices have been circumscribed. The Victorian home they bought a decade ago, which they are now renting out, is in a majority black neighborhood where poverty has increased, damaging their investment. Their current neighborhood, where the duplex is, has a median household income of just $34,000 a year, or around $20,000 less than what\u2019s typical for the region.It\u2019s one of many ways that living around people whom they best relate to means wrestling day and night with the cumulative effects of racism.The burning cars and buildings, the people throwing rocks and bottles at police officers in riot gear \u2014 it was all happening last Saturday as Maanaan and JoAnne Sabir were settling in for the night just a few miles down the road.The 23-year-old man who had been shot by a black officer had ignored orders to drop a gun as he fled on foot after being pulled over in his car, the police said.\u201cYou\u2019re asking us to do the impossible, which is to tolerate a systemic demoralization of our own livelihood,\u201d Mr. Sabir said.Black families in Milwaukee have been confronting hostility for decades. Zeddie Quitman Hyler directly challenged housing segregation in 1955 when he began laying the foundation for a house on an open patch of land in the white western suburb of Wauwatosa.A postal worker and World War II veteran from rural Mississippi, Mr. Hyler was the first black man to try to build there, and his efforts were not appreciated. He returned to his construction site one day to find the frame damaged. He fixed it, but when he came back again, it had burned.So he enlisted several friends to camp out with him at the construction site one evening, rifles in hand, ready to turn away intruders. The vandals never returned, and Mr. Hyler finished building his house, which he lived in for nearly half a century until his death in 2004.While Mr. Hyler was branching out, Ms. Sabir\u2019s grandparents found themselves falling into the familiar cycle of segregation. Migrants from the South, they spent about 10 years trying to buy a house at a time when black families were overtly steered to particular blocks. Eventually, a family member who was a real estate agent worked her connections, and they landed the duplex on the corner of North 17th Street and North Avenue in the mid-1950s. The neighborhood was evolving from one that had been flush with synagogues and restaurants selling matzo ball soup.They were caught in the middle of white flight.The census tract where Ms. Sabir\u2019s grandparents settled was entirely white in 1950 except for the two people that the census listed as black and the six listed as \u201cother.\u201d By 1960, however, 2,344 black people called the area home, accounting for 65 percent of its population.Within a few years, Milwaukee\u2019s economy would start tanking. Tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs in the city were eliminated. Property values fell, while housing policies made it nearly impossible for black families to obtain loans and move to the suburbs, where many jobs were being relocated.The racial dividing lines were already drawn, however, and barriers to black upward mobility remained. Even the neighborhood where the baseball slugger Hank Aaron moved in the late 1950s could not avoid a downward spiral. While the black population in the Rufus King area grew from 0.4 percent in 1960 to 89 percent in 1980, its median home value dropped from 9 percent above the city\u2019s median to 23 percent below it, according to \u201cMilwaukee: City of Neighborhoods,\u201d a book by John Gurda.Few people around here are surprised, then, that only 11.1 percent of African-Americans in the region live in the suburbs, the lowest rate of black suburbanization among the 50 largest metropolitan areas in the country, according to a soon-to-be released study by Marc V. Levine, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.Milwaukee itself, which is nearly two-thirds nonwhite, has never elected a black mayor. As for Wauwatosa, the suburb that Mr. Hyler changed a generation ago, it is still 90 percent white.The Sabirs are trying to help their children maneuver through this complicated racial landscape.Taj and Ameera go to a Catholic private school in Milwaukee where most of the students are white, but return to a Muslim household in a neighborhood where most people look like them. Both environments present difficulties.At school, the Sabir children have heard a teacher play down slavery, and classmates stereotype black neighborhoods as bad and drug infested. On their block, where the sidewalks are cracked and some empty lots have been turned into gardens, they occasionally see drugs and fights.It\u2019s at times like those when JoAnne and Maanaan Sabir are happy that their children can come home, see the nuance of the black struggle and work to change it \u2014 as when Ameera helped petition to prevent a liquor store from opening in the neighborhood. Or when the children volunteer at a food bank down the block.Still, their parents can\u2019t help but flirt with the possibilities of another life. That\u2019s what they were doing one evening in late June as they cruised through the plush suburbs, partaking in a semiregular ritual of soaking in the Lake Michigan mansions and manicured lawns and wondering about life there. They rolled past children riding their bicycles alone at around 9 p.m., and Ms. Sabir marveled that they could do that.She thought back to when Taj, 12, had confronted her a few days earlier. He had asked for permission to ride his eight-speed bike around the block. Ms. Sabir could not go out to supervise him, so she said no.\u201cAre you finally going to admit that we live in a dangerous community?\u201d he said.Ms. Sabir pondered the question. She is trained for these moments, with a bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology and a master\u2019s in administrative social work, but she struggled. \u201cWe have challenges like every other community has challenges,\u201d she told him, adding, \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to figure out the best way to negotiate those challenges.\u201dManaging sometimes means moving on. And in Milwaukee\u2019s circle of affluent black professionals, that sometimes means decamping for majority white areas in the city or the suburbs.That\u2019s where Latisha Spence-Brookens and X\u2019antony Brookens Sr. found themselves five years ago after their North Milwaukee neighborhood rapidly deteriorated during the housing crash.They rolled into their new bungalow-style rental house in the village of Whitefish Bay, a suburb perched on Lake Michigan with a population so white (90 percent) that it has earned the moniker Whitefolks Bay. And then they looked around in amazement. People were walking. Everywhere.Some strolled past the two-story homes with red, white and blue bunting on the balconies. Others strolled along the main thoroughfare with a Starbucks, a sidewalk cafe, a store selling handblown glass, and a supermarket featuring live lobster, a full-service florist and Champagne caper vinaigrette.The Milwaukee neighborhood they had left behind, which was nearly 93 percent black, wasn\u2019t much for this kind of leisure. After they bought a two-bedroom home in 2008 for $98,000, the effects of the housing market collapse spread through the area. Homes were abandoned. Crime took over.Their son, X\u2019antony Jr., now 18, was walking home one afternoon, toting a plastic Walmart bag with a Barbie he had just bought for his little sister, Zaria, when a man approached him with a large rock in his hand.\u201cGive me all your money or I\u2019m going to bash your head in with this rock,\u201d the man told him.X\u2019antony Jr. hesitated.\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThis was my first time being robbed.\u201dSo he offered $5 to the robber, who took it and let X\u2019antony Jr. keep the Barbie.For X\u2019antony Sr., 48, the last straw came when a neighbor was held up at gunpoint as she came home with her two toddlers. It was too dangerous to stay, he thought.Their home value had plummeted by some 75 percent by then. They had no equity to buy up. So they walked away from the mortgage and rented a house in Whitefish Bay for $1,450 a month, nearly one and a half times what they had been paying for the home they owned.But finally, they thought, Zaria could ride her bicycle freely. X\u2019antony Jr. could enroll in a high-performing school district.Over the years, the Brookenses genuinely enjoyed their time in Whitefish Bay. Ms. Spence-Brookens, 39, worked as a college administrator and Mr. Brookens as a job counselor for food stamp recipients, and they sometimes would make it a point to get home early from work so they could spend time in the community. But it was hard to shake that feeling of otherness \u2014 especially for X\u2019antony Sr.About a week after the family moved there, a police officer pulled him over as he rolled up in his red 1994 Mercedes-Benz to the family\u2019s modest clapboard.He was pulled over, the officer said, because of the plastic cover over his license plate. Back in his old neighborhood, Mr. Brookens said, people often stole license plates, so the cover was for security. Here it was illegal, the officer told him. He let Mr. Brookens off with a warning, but not before asking if he lived around there.\u201cYeah, this is my house right here,\u201d Mr. Brookens told him.The stops were a routine occurrence early on \u2014 about once a week for a month and a half, Mr. Brookens said. He called it getting registered.\u201cThey\u2019re going to keep doing that until they become comfortable with who you are and why you\u2019re here,\u201d said Mr. Brookens, more resigned than angry.He had more disgust, however, when he took Zaria around the block on her bicycle and a mother rushed her white children inside as they approached.Mr. Brookens and his wife also worried about Zaria\u2019s sense of self. She always wanted to straighten her hair. She once bawled when her hair got wet in the bathtub and became frizzy. Zaria\u2019s school friends called her their black friend. Her musical tastes gravitated toward Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift.\u201cI thought she was getting lost,\u201d Mr. Brookens said.That was not necessarily in the front of the Brookenses\u2019 minds when, two years ago, a friend asked them to rent her cream-colored brick home in Milwaukee. It was surrounded by quiet bungalows and curved streets. It was bigger than their Whitefish Bay rental, and the rent was $350 cheaper.They thought of how the savings would allow them to do more of the things they like, such as travel. Although the house was in a neighborhood with a poverty rate 12 times higher and a median home value about one-third of that in their suburban neighborhood, they saw it as a place they could call home.So they returned to Milwaukee, to a different black neighborhood, joining the cluster of families like their own on the city\u2019s north side.Some of the old challenges re-emerged.About a month after moving there in 2014, Mr. Brookens forgot to lock his car door, and his charger and computer hard drive were stolen.Still, like many black families who have made similar choices, they say they feel more comfortable. Zaria, who recently turned 9, relishes seeing more children at school who look like her, and has come to embrace her blackness, going so far as to get dreadlocks. X\u2019antony Jr. has spent the summer working for an activist organization.The Brookenses now interact more frequently with their neighbors. They host cookouts regularly in their backyard, and they have decorated their shelves with plaques reminding them: \u201cHope is believing\u201d and \u201cFaith is endless.\u201dHope and faith, and determination, drive the Sabirs, too.That\u2019s what brought JoAnne Sabir\u2019s ancestors up here from Tennessee and Arkansas. It\u2019s why Mr. Sabir, a fourth-degree black belt in karate, is constantly pushing to help the young men he sees roaming the streets \u2014 \u201cYou got that r\u00e9sum\u00e9?\u201d he asks \u2014 and it\u2019s why the family is staking its business interests just a block from their apartment.They bet on the neighborhood by opening the Juice Kitchen in October. They both work there, often rising before 6 a.m., because they want to be a beacon of black success and help prevent drugs, alcohol and poverty from consuming the community.\u201cStrategically placed on North 17th Street,\u201d she wrote. \u201cStrategically available to love and nurture.\u201dA few hours later, she herded her children into her black sport-utility vehicle and slowly rolled past the remnants of the two nights of clashes between protesters and the police. Past the BP gas station, melted into an ashy heap. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible,\u201d Taj said. Past the people barbecuing on a grassy knoll. \u201cThat\u2019s the young man\u2019s brother over there that was killed,\u201d Ms. Sabir said. Past a boarded-up bank. \u201cThey broke in this bank and then set it on fire,\u201d she said.\u201cMy initial thought,\u201d Ms. Sabir told her children, \u201cwas that on this evening, all these young people were so powerful.\u201d But imagine, she added, if they could channel that anger in a positive direction, \u201cif we took that power and that energy and put it toward our greater good.\u201dEveryone in the car fell silent.Focusing on the bigger picture can be difficult.The following evening, on Wednesday night, as Mr. Sabir reclined on his front stoop, he shook his head as car after car whizzed through red lights at the corner. He mentioned a man from the neighborhood who was left in a vegetative state when an S.U.V. plowed into his car a few weeks earlier. \u201cIt aches,\u201d Mr. Sabir said.He rolled his eyes when a car pulled up to a house across the street at about 10:30 p.m. and started honking loudly. \u201cEvery night,\u201d Mr. Sabir said.And he just looked away when a man strolling in front of his house ditched a knife behind a parked car, only to be confronted by two police officers, with Tasers drawn, who arrested him. \u201cMass incarceration,\u201d Mr. Sabir said.But just as it seemed that the burdens of living here were converging, Mr. Sabir\u2019s phone buzzed with a reminder of why it was all worth it. The alderman representing the area where most of the past week\u2019s vandalism had occurred wrote that his battered neighborhood could really use a Juice Kitchen.\u201cHelp us,\u201d the alderman wrote, \u201cbe the Phoenix that rises from the ashes.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That was not all: She would not welcome anyone who merely supported the idea of owning such a weapon.Some chains have declared themselves gun-free zones, often in response to state \u201copen carry\u201d laws that allow people to take unconcealed firearms into establishments like restaurants, including those that serve alcohol.Ms. Verrill went a step further than most, spurning those who support the right to own a particularly lethal type of weapon \u2014 whether they own one or not.\u201cI cannot, in good conscience, accept anyone inside of my restaurants who believes that this is OK,\u201d she wrote.Supporters of gun rights vented their fury toward Ms. Verrill on social media. They called for a boycott of her restaurants and posted hundreds of negative online reviews of Grace, an upscale establishment that has been called one of the best restaurants in Maine \u2014 and, with its vaulted ceiling and stained glass windows, one of the most visually striking. They took particular umbrage at her effort to weed out patrons based on their beliefs.The backlash on social media quickly led her to delete the Facebook post. She said that she stood by her views but that the post had become a platform for haters.Her critics migrated to that post. \u201cIt\u2019s far too late to hide your moronic post from earlier,\u201d one commenter wrote. \u201cYour stupidity has since gone viral and your rating on Facebook has plummeted.\u201dLooking back now, Ms. Verrill said in an interview, she wishes she had worded her original post differently because it gave critics an opening to question how exactly she would bar people for their beliefs \u2014 a distraction from her main point about the horror of gun violence. Many said she was behaving no differently from a baker who would not make a cake for a same-sex wedding, but she rejected that analogy.\u201cGun owners are not a protected class,\u201d she said. \u201cOwning a gun is a choice. It bears literally no resemblance to the biological nature of the color of your skin or your sexual orientation.\u201dStill, trying to bar people based on their beliefs would most likely draw a legal challenge.Seven weeks after her original post, things have stabilized, Ms. Verrill said. She has not lost any business, she said, and the tourist season is in full swing. While the attacks from people across the country surprised her, so did the extent of the support.Recent diners included Erica Smegielski, the daughter of Dawn Hochsprung, the principal who was killed in the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown.And they included Dan and Sue Fogel, tourists from North Carolina who visited Grace for dinner last week after their Uber driver recommended it. They were unaware of Ms. Verrill\u2019s stance on guns, but once they learned about it, they were pleased to be dining there.\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing on guns isn\u2019t working, and we have to do something different,\u201d said Mr. Fogel, 69, a college professor.Eric Goldberg, 43, an insurance executive from New York who took his family to Grace after his wife read a review, was more ambivalent.\u201cWhile I admire the owner for trying to address an issue she cares about, I am not comfortable with business owners deciding who to serve based on their beliefs,\u201d he said.In all the hubbub over her stance, Ms. Verrill was surprised that members of a nearby gun club wanted to speak to her in person.Tammy Walter, the president of the Spurwink Rod & Gun Club in Cape Elizabeth, said she and three others had met with Ms. Verrill at her restaurant in early July and talked for 90 minutes. Neither side changed the other\u2019s opinion, but both said the discussion had been civil.Ms. Walter said in an interview that she had apologized for writing a fake restaurant review that gave Grace zero stars. But, she added, she wanted Ms. Verrill to understand that she had offended responsible gun owners by lumping them in the same category as the Orlando gunman.Ms. Walter also said she would like to go back to the restaurant sometime for dinner. When told of Ms. Walter\u2019s desire, Ms. Verrill said that she worried that such a visit would be more of a publicity stunt and that her impulse would be to ask her to leave.But Ms. Verrill added: \u201cIf I saw her in her cardigan and pearls sitting at a table, I don\u2019t think I would have the heart to ask her to get up and leave. And I guess that is the crux of taking a big stand in a small community.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Facebook was a college social site before it became a global media hub; Amazon was a bookseller before it was, well, everything.Joe MacMillan (Lee Pace), a mysterious, smooth-talking drifter of a businessman, was paired with Gordon Clark (Scoot McNairy), a brilliant but failed engineer, in a sketchy scheme to bring an IBM clone to market. As a plot, it was less than inspiring, and as a character story, less than inspired: an 8-bit Don Draper and a Walter White who dealt in megabytes rather than meth.But at the end of its first season, \u201cHalt\u201d did something almost unheard-of in television, if not in tech: It upended its entire project. With the introduction of the Apple Macintosh, Joe and Gordon discovered that they had been chasing yesterday\u2019s dream. They were thinking too small, too incrementally. The quest of the entire season had been a failure of imagination.The headlines then were about computing power coming to your desktop. But the long-term change, barely glimmering in the days of telephone modems, lay in the connection of every desktop to every other. It was the birth of the social internet, where we now live.Season 2 followed Mutiny, a nascent online gaming company started by Gordon\u2019s wife, Donna (Kerry Bish\u00e9), and Cameron Howe (Mackenzie Davis), an impassioned sparkplug of a programmer.For all practical purposes, the series changed not just its focus but its lead characters. Cameron was visionary but impractical; Donna relished the new start but chafed at being forced into the role of the buzz kill adult in the room. (Ms. Bish\u00e9 gave a nuanced, undersung performance.)This was something we hadn\u2019t seen so often before: a tricky but fruitful alliance between two women in a male-dominated industry. Cameron had the digital native\u2019s instinct to see the online world as a place of constant invention. Donna had the emotional intelligence to notice that Mutiny\u2019s social component \u2014 its chat rooms \u2014 was the future of the future.Season 3, which begins on Tuesday, continues the show\u2019s iterative-learning process, picking up in 1986, as Mutiny has relocated from Texas to Silicon Valley and is beginning to reconceive itself one more time. (Cameron and Donna have noticed their gamers\u2019 taking over Mutiny chat to negotiate real-world trades \u2014 shades of Craigslist or eBay.)The growing pains continue, throwing the women into the unfamiliar and testosterone-heavy world of venture capitalists. \u201cIt only takes one of them to ask you to the dance,\u201d says their consigliere, John Bosworth (Toby Huss). Cameron replies, \u201cI love how even the metaphors in this business are sexist.\u201d They find a possible ally in Diane (Annabeth Gish), a sympathetic but bluntly honest investor.Gordon has come along in tow, feeling at loose ends in a managerial role at Mutiny. The chameleonic Joe, meanwhile, has landed in California as the head of a software-security firm, sporting a Steve Jobsian beard and speaking in pretentious koans. (\u201cI\u2019ve been accused of selling fear,\u201d he tells a rapt audience. \u201cBut let me ask you: Is it fear or is it truth?\u201d)Joe\u2019s re-reinvention as a smug tech guru suits Mr. Pace, a striking but peculiar presence whom the show has struggled to use effectively. (He was well cast in the \u201cHobbit\u201d movies as the frosty, Eurotrash-y elven king Thranduil.) He seems fully at home now, strutting around his office listening to Gary Numan music, carrying himself like a human Patrick Nagel print.The new season takes time to reset, and the movement in the early episodes is slow. The character dynamics are solid, though, and the \u201980s details continue to be spot on.

{"Headline": "The Tyranny of Other People\u2019s Vacation Photos", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCirca NowChief among my favorite Facebook memories is the time that a high-powered journalist of my acquaintance breezily informed us all that he was at the Grill Room of the Four Seasons with Ted Danson, tucking into some sea urchin. To which one friend responded, \u201cThat\u2019s funny, because I\u2019m at the Midtown tunnel with Rhea Perlman, eating shawarma.\u201dWhat prompts the excessive posting of these pictures?Indeed, the motivation behind many fahvolous vacation photos would seem to be a rationalization of large expenditures for the purpose of recreation: a $6,000 beach rental ought to bring you $6,000 worth of pleasure, and maybe posting a photo will get the dopamine flowing.But one can detect other motives, too: a tone-deaf attempt at self-branding, a neurotic attempt to thank your host, a need for constant scrutiny.Noxious selfie sticks now seem like nothing compared to the sophisticated camera filters that can turn an average-looking strawberry patch into a brooding welter of Caravaggio-esque chiaroscuro.Equally jarring, some Instagram and Facebook users seem to want us to know that their summer is more inherently summery than ours: more barefoot, more glistening, more sarong-driven.These folks are biting into the fresh fig of life, and this biting produces carefree laughter. My natural habitat is an oceanside bonfire where a Viggo Mortensen look-alike strums a weathered guitar! All backyards are enlivened by a spray of 8-year-old girls in sundresses! Everything I eat in August is cooked on a stick!\u201cI have a client who really wants Likes, so he posts a lot of photos,\u201d Dr. Vannucci said. \u201cWhen people don\u2019t respond to them, he feels very alone. So he posts more. It\u2019s a cycle like any interpersonal cycle in which we\u2019re doing something that people hate but we\u2019re doing it to try to make people like us. With that type of client, I try to find out what the motivation for posting is: What are the feelings around it? What is he looking for? Then I try to help him find other outlets.\u201dFor those on the receiving end of such founts of images, the critical factors are frequency and tone. On the frequency front, young Mr. Haynes had a good suggestion: \u201cI think you get three photos per location.\u201d If you can\u2019t remember whether you already posted a picture of that covered bridge, you are in danger of overestimating other people\u2019s interest in covered bridges.The question of tone is more nuanced. In 2014, the software company CyberLink sponsored a poll of 2,268 adults in the United States, \u201cwith the hypothesis,\u201d the company\u2019s senior vice president for global marketing, Richard Carriere, told me, \u201cthat some people have a tendency to post photos on social media just to gloat and annoy their friends and colleagues.\u201dThe study found that one in seven who own a smartphone and who use social media would unfollow or block someone who posts what they perceive as boastful vacation pictures. Moreover, one in four will attempt to share a photo within one hour of arriving at their destination \u2014 which makes many of us want to summon from deep within us the turban-wearing drama teacher who gets two syllables out of \u201cBreeeeathe.\u201dThe top reasons that those sampled said they would Like or Favorite a picture were: if it showed friends and family sharing a special moment (63 percent), they look happy (58 percent) or they look genuine and natural (48 percent). I expressed surprise to Mr. Carriere that the poll didn\u2019t break down the specifics of bothersome photos.I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to guess that the most troublesome one would be a vacation photo in which your ex is dating someone who\u2019s essentially you, but 15 years younger, and it\u2019s a picture of the two of them in the tiny fishing village in Portugal that you turned your ex on to in the first place.\u201dMr. Carriere said, \u201cI would definitely unfriend my ex for that.\u201dThe letter concluded with: \u201cGo have some kids and don\u2019t be so selfish as to only think of yourselves all the time.\u201d Yet one of the trips the couple had taken was a trip to New York that they had bought at a breast cancer benefit, not to mention the fact that the wife of the couple works as a psychotherapist who specializes in helping sexually and physically abused children.Equally odd were the facts that the letter\u2019s envelope was emblazoned with a bright yellow smiley sticker and that the postmark was Miami, a city that none of the couple\u2019s friends live in. So maybe the letter writer was on vacation at the time.The wife of the couple put the letter on Facebook with the instruction: \u201cPlease feel free to unfriend us from Facebook as we clearly are not \u2018friends.\u2019 If you\u2019re unsure how to unfriend someone, go to the \u2018Help\u2019 menu.\u201dThe couples\u2019 friends rallied with support in the post\u2019s comments section. \u201cMaybe if they spent less time on FB stalking you,\u201d one wrote, \u201cthey could work more, make more money and go on a vacation, too.\u201dIn certain rare instances, too many vacation photos are not enough. Dr. Vannucci said that after one of his clients had his wedding canceled at the last minute, he \u201cwas really struggling.\u201d He posted that it was called off but that he was still going to \u201cenjoy the honeymoon.\u201d On came a cavalcade of photos of one man\u2019s painful efforts at readjustment, all of them captioned, Dr. Vannucci said, \u201cwith funny, raw but heartbreaking comments.\u201d One groom\u2019s Stations of the Cross.Conscious that my own trickle of humble-braggy, emotionally stifled summertime photos on Facebook is its own version of fahvolousness, I spent a recent trip to Spain second-guessing myself. While, yes, I did share a picture of an outpost of the restaurant chain Museo del Jamon, I did not post a slew of others.Not the stylish dog walker and her dachshund that I intended to caption \u201cTiny pants, tiny dog: Madrid.\u201d Not the gorgeous honeycomb-like ceilings of the Alhambra. Not the 12-hour trip home when my boyfriend clutched his half-inflated neck pillow to his chest and referred to it as \u201ccomfort bosoms.\u201dBut am I being immodest when I tell you that I now see these omissions as a disservice to my friends and colleagues, who may have loved them.I am trying to calibrate my photographic output. As we all should.In the meantime, let us all delicately start a conversation about one of this topic\u2019s thorniest issues.

{"Headline": "A Widow Takes the Helm at Blackberry Farm", "Date": "2016-08-09", "News": "Supported by13 PhotosWALLAND, Tenn. \u2014 For someone who could ski as well as Sam Beall, his first run down a Colorado slope that February afternoon was supposed to be easy.His father, Samuel E. Beall III, who founded the Ruby Tuesday chain and whom everyone calls Sandy, hired a lawyer who investigated. Mr. Beall came to the conclusion everyone else had: that Sam, a superb athlete who thought nothing of racing 100 miles on his bicycle or wrestling a 400-pound marlin out of the Gulf of Mexico, had died in a freakish accident, and that no one was to blame.\u201cA lot of times, he was doing crazy things,\u201d said Mary Celeste Beall, 39, the woman with whom he fell in love in high school and who for 18 years was his wife. \u201cIf he had been hot-dogging or jumping off cliffs, I would have been mad. But there\u2019s no explanation.\u201dThe Bealls, who divided their time between a house they built on the farm and one in Knoxville, Tenn., had five children. The oldest is about to enter the University of Georgia. The youngest is 3. It has fallen to Mrs. Beall to raise her family and step into her husband\u2019s role as the proprietor and president of Blackberry Farm.For the better part of a decade, Blackberry Farm has been a significant player in the elevation of both hyper-local Southern cooking and the idea of a luxury vacation built around agriculture. Its collection of cottages and farmhouses sits on 4,200 hilly acres in a part of rural Tennessee that needs the 500 jobs the resort provides.Critics love its cheeses, jam and beer. Chefs around the country long for an invitation to cook in the Barn, its showcase restaurant built in a 200-year-old barn that Mr. Beall had dismantled and moved from Pennsylvania.His death plunged Mrs. Beall into a role she had never imagined. She\u2019s a private person, and the first to tell you she is not as good at prioritizing as her husband was.But now she is the one hosting winemakers and explaining the Blackberry philosophy at events like the Food and Wine Classic in Aspen. The future of the multimillion-dollar family business is in her hands, and so far, she can barely keep up with the meetings.In the horrible first days after the accident, Mrs. Beall was so focused on the kids, the funeral and her own grief that she hadn\u2019t thought much about who might run the place. Shortly after her husband was buried, her father-in-law walked into the couple\u2019s bedroom.\u201cMary Celeste, you know you auditioned when you got up at the service to speak,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou know you have to run Blackberry.\u201dOver a recent breakfast in the sunny dining room of the 1930s farmhouse that remains the farm\u2019s center, Mr. Beall conceded that the conversation may have come sooner \u201cthan anyone with more sensitivity might have done.\u201dBut there were guests to care for and a family empire to protect.\u201cShe knows, like we all know, that Blackberry will be in our family forever, forever and another forever and another forever on top of that,\u201d he said.Mr. Beall and his first wife, Kreis, bought the little inn tucked up against the Great Smoky Mountains in 1976, the year Sam was born. They kept adding land and rooms, and serving food that punched above its weight. In 1998, they turned what had become a Relais & Ch\u00e2teaux resort over to Sam and his younger brother, David. But it was Sam who made the place his life\u2019s work.Building on the business acumen he learned from his father and a preternatural touch for hospitality and aesthetics that he got from his mother, Sam Beall coaxed Blackberry Farm into a culinary powerhouse, with a wine cellar that held the kind of Gaja nebbiolos and rare Rh\u00f4ne varieties most sommeliers could only dream of.It was all built on a foundation of simple Tennessee country life as reinterpreted for guests willing to pay a premium to taste its pleasures without any of its hardships. Blackberry Farm became a place where the powerful could lose themselves on a rope swing and where rich Manhattanites could put on hiking boots and wander down to the trout stream. What most people call a walk in the woods was rebranded as forest bathing.The spa sells $450 bottles of face cream, but there is also an old fellow with an encyclopedic knowledge of East Tennessee seeds and plants who gets paid to hang out near the garden in case guests want to chat or hand-mill some corn for grits. There are Smoky Mountain trails to hike, a box with Hershey bars and marshmallows near the nightly bonfire and shampoo custom blended with bourbon and Appalachian hyssop.Whether Blackberry led the South\u2019s culinary renaissance or rode its wave is still something students of Southern food debate, but there is no doubt it has had an outsize impact on the region.\u201cHe has turned the world on to what East Tennessee has to offer, but also helped those who live here in the region see themselves in a new way,\u201d said Ashley Capps, the Knoxville native who started the four-day Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival, which brings almost 80,000 people to Manchester, Tenn., each summer.Mrs. Beall said her husband didn\u2019t invent anything new at Blackberry. \u201cHe always just wanted to bring light to what was already here,\u201d she said.In the six months since her husband died, Mrs. Beall has been learning the business, but her primary focus has been on her children. She wants to keep the family rituals and rhythms the same, especially when it comes to meals.Mr. Beall, who studied at the California Culinary Academy and at Northern California culinary temples like Cowgirl Creamery and the French Laundry, was so dedicated to cooking his family dinner that it was not uncommon to see him standing in the kitchen in sweaty bike clothes, digging though his collection of olive oils and vinegars and a pile of produce from the Blackberry garden. At his funeral, his oldest daughter, Cameron, joked that she would miss being late for school because he had decided the family needed waffles for breakfast.Mrs. Beall was often the one left cleaning their huge kitchen and admonishing Mr. Beall to put on a clean shirt when the family sat down to dinner. She\u2019s thinking about adding another cookbook to the Blackberry Farm collection, one in which the children cook their dad\u2019s favorite hits.\u201cI really want it to feel like he\u2019s in the kitchen with them,\u201d she said. Already, her 7-year-old daughter, Josephine, has taken to making soft scrambled eggs just as her father taught her, and her only son, Sam V, 13, can saber a Champagne bottle and coax perfect, thin slices from a ham that had been curing in his father\u2019s personal wine cellar for three years.\u201cI really don\u2019t think there\u2019s one thing their dad hasn\u2019t taught them,\u201d she said.\u201cThe world doesn\u2019t know how to grieve,\u201d Mrs. Beall said. \u201cNo one talks about it. Our society needs to learn to have real conversations about things. It doesn\u2019t have to be a therapy session, just a real conversation.\u201dHer friends, like Kimberly Schlapman, a singer in the band Little Big Town and a cooking personality, is encouraging Mrs. Beall to carry on where Mr. Beall left off. Ms. Schlapman\u2019s husband died after a heart attack in 2005.\u201cI know from being a widow myself how very important it is for that man\u2019s dreams to live on through her,\u201d she said.Mrs. Beall, who has a graduate degree in accounting from the University of Tennessee and loves design and architecture, is relying on the tight-knit team of loyal, longtime employees her husband built. Many described her leadership style as inspirational, but she said she is still feeling her way. Managing time seems to be the most vexing part of her new job.\u201cNow I know why Sam was so hard to get ahold of,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was in all these meetings all day.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s never a good time to lose the love of your life, but the timing was amazing,\u201d she said.At his memorial service, she addressed the staff assembled at the Knoxville church directly. \u201cSam was preparing us,\u201d she told them. \u201cHe was preparing us to be independent, to do this.\u201dIndeed, the staff\u2019s dedication to hospitality was clear in the days after his death. The lodge never shut down, not even on the day of his funeral.After the service, his body was taken back to the farm. The coffin, a pine box his mother had made for herself years earlier, was loaded onto a wagon. As the family followed, two of the farm\u2019s best horses began pulling Mr. Beall across his beloved land one last time to a grave dug next to a tiny chapel on a rise near the edge of the property.Staff members had lined up along the gravel path to watch him pass. In the inn\u2019s old days, before the Bealls took over, staff members would wave white napkins from the veranda as guests departed. They called it the Blackberry salute.As Mr. Beall\u2019s coffin passed, they raised white napkins. Then they headed back to tend to the guests, most of whom had no idea that the man who had built Blackberry Farm was buried that day.An earlier version of this article misstated the year Kimberly Schlapman\u2019s husband died.

{"Headline": "Flooding Compounds Pain of Tragic Summer in Baton Rouge", "Date": "2016-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBATON ROUGE, La. \u2014 Few can appreciate the scale of devastation and loss here quite like the tow truck driver.Since before dawn, Terrance Carter was up, first getting a flooded Cadillac out of Zachary, a town where more than two feet of rain had fallen in 72 hours. Soon after, he was hooking up a pickup truck abandoned by its driver during the floods in a neighborhood of North Baton Rouge, where nearly every house had the telltale brown stain up past the windowsills. Two hours later, he was taking a minivan through the charmingly named and thoroughly devastated middle-class subdivisions in the eastern part of the city.\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to pass by that store,\u201d said Mr. Carter, a 28-year-old father of four who like thousands here is now homeless. He drove on in silence for some blocks. Then he pointed: \u201cAll this flooded.\u201dBy Wednesday morning, about 7,000 people were spread among 37 shelters across flood-ravaged southern Louisiana, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said. Later in the day, the death toll reached 13, and state officials said they were still searching homes and businesses after a flood that the American Red Cross described as \u201cthe worst natural disaster to strike the United States since Superstorm Sandy.\u201dIn Ascension Parish, southeast of Baton Rouge, the local emergency preparedness director compared rescue operations to those that followed Hurricane Katrina in 2005. \u201cThe sheltering effort is actually greater than what we saw for Hurricane Katrina,\u201d the director, Richard A. Webre, said.The White House said that President Obama, who was vacationing in Massachusetts, had received a briefing on Wednesday morning from the FEMA administrator, W. Craig Fugate, who visited Louisiana this week. More than 70,000 people had registered for federal assistance, the White House said.Nearly everyone here has been affected by one of the crises this summer, some by two and some by all three. Police officers in Baton Rouge have been working extended shifts of 12 hours each, even though, according to a department spokesman, the flooding affected \u201ca large number\u201d of officers.\u201cWe\u2019re out there and we\u2019re doing what we can,\u201d said Sgt. Don Coppola Jr. of the Baton Rouge Police Department.In Livingston Parish, the Sheriff\u2019s Office said that at least 60 deputies had had to deal with flood damage. \u201cSome have nowhere to go,\u201d the agency said on its Facebook page.The homes of the families of the three law enforcement officers killed on July 17 \u2014 Cpl. Montrell L. Jackson and Officer Matthew Gerald of the Baton Rouge police, and Deputy Brad Garafola of the East Baton Rouge Sheriff\u2019s Office \u2014 had made it through the floods, officials said, some damaged but none ruined.Mr. Carter had been asleep early on July 5 when his mother called and told him that her brother, Mr. Sterling, had been shot by an officer at the Triple S. The days unfolded and exploded. Mr. Carter\u2019s employer saw him on television talking about the shooting and fired him, Mr. Carter said. A baby daughter was born a week later. Three days after that, Mr. Carter stood before hundreds at his uncle\u2019s funeral service and recited a poem he had written, \u201cKiss From Your Nephew.\u201dTwo days afterward, the three officers were shot dead by a man from Missouri angered about Mr. Sterling\u2019s death. Mr. Carter emphasized to the reporters who asked: He did not condone violence at all; he has relatives on the police force.The summer quieted until the rains came this past weekend. He had to spend Saturday and Sunday nights in a shelter in Baton Rouge with his four young children, from 5 weeks to 7 years, and Bessia Moore, the mother of the two youngest.On Monday, he moved everyone to his sisters\u2019 small house, joining nine other people and two dogs. On Tuesday, he went to the house where he, his children, his mother and stepfather had been living, and found it and everything in it ruined. On Wednesday, he was back at work.\u201cSomebody gave me the clothes I have on now,\u201d he said Wednesday, sitting in the truck cab equipped with a pack of cigarettes and the last of his insulin shots. \u201cNothing I have on is mine. Even the shoes.\u201dThis part of his story is not so different from many others in south Louisiana. It has similarities with Michelle Monistere, who had the minivan in Lakeview Estates, which like so many subdivisions in the eastern part of the city was congested with piles of ruined mattresses, carpeting, wallboard and furniture.It is familiar to Tasha Butler, who was taking everything out of the house where she had lived for 35 out of the last 40 years.\u201cIt was bad,\u201d she said through a dust mask. \u201cIt\u2019s everything.\u201dMr. Carter was in North Baton Rouge, a struggling and often overlooked part of the city where he has lived most of his life, to retrieve the pickup.Discarded cars littered the streets. Mr. Carter recognized Ms. Butler\u2019s house, having helped paint it when he was 10.\u201cIn time, it will be better,\u201d said Ms. Butler, throwing another garbage bag on the enormous pile on her lawn.After hours on the road, Mr. Carter finally stopped for something to eat: fried shrimp and fish at the V & P Seafood and Deli. A local news channel was playing, and the police chief of a small flooded Louisiana city was talking of the coffins that had floated up from graveyards.\u201cEven the dead can\u2019t rest,\u201d the chief was saying.Mr. Carter watched. He had feared this possibility when he was in the shelter over the weekend, he said. So he had walked from the shelter to his uncle\u2019s grave. It had not been disturbed.Campbell Robertson reported from Baton Rouge, and Alan Blinder from Atlanta.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "France Has the Burkini Blues", "Date": "2016-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn 2004, an Australian woman of Lebanese descent, Aheda Zanetti, discovered a market niche. Troubled by the sight of her young niece trying to play netball in an unwieldy combination of hijab and team uniform, she decided to design something suitable for Muslim sensibilities that combined modesty and practicality. Soon after she did the same thing for Muslim women who wanted to swim at Sydney beaches \u2014 but not in bikinis.She founded a company, Ahiida, to produce the new attire, which included the \u201chijood\u201d \u2014 a synthesis of hijab and hood \u2014 and the \u201cburkini\u201d \u2014 an amalgam of burqa and bikini. In 2006, Zanetti trademarked the names \u201cburkini\u201d and \u201cburqini\u201d in Australia and elsewhere. The swimwear \u2014 two-piece, full-body, head-covering garments \u2014 took off. For many Muslim women the burkini solved a beach dilemma.Fast-forward a dozen years through a period of growing tension between Islam and the West to Cannes on the French C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, where the mayor this month banned use of burkinis. Cannes is just 15 miles from Nice, the site of a terrorist attack last month in which a man loyal to the Islamic State drove a truck into a festive crowd, killing 85 people.The ordinance of the Cannes mayor, David Lisnard, said: \u201cBeach attire that ostentatiously displays a religious affiliation, while France and places of worship are the target of terrorist acts, is likely to create risks to public order.\u201dLisnard\u2019s position \u2014 adopted by the authorities in a few other resort towns \u2014 has now been backed by Manuel Valls, the French prime minister. He told the newspaper La Provence this week that, \u201cThe burkini is not a new range of swimwear, a fashion. It is the expression of a political project, a counter-society, based notably on the enslavement of women.\u201dValls said that, \u201cIf we want to construct an Islam of France compatible with our values, our liberties and male-female equality, then Islam must, as other religions have done, accept discretion in the manifestation of its religious convictions.\u201d He added, \u201cIn this very particular period where we suffer terrorist attacks in the name of a delinquent Islam, all citizens must assume their responsibilities.\u201dA number of factors have turned France into the epicenter of the clash between extremist Islam and Western societies. They include the presence of Western Europe\u2019s largest Muslim community, French participation in conflicts from the Middle East to Mali, the tensions deriving from France\u2019s troubled colonial past (notably in Algeria), and, perhaps most of all, the Republic\u2019s firm doctrine of la\u00efcit\u00e9, or secularism, designed to subsume all ethnic, racial, religious and other differences into French citizenship.Valls said that secularism was not the negation of religion but the protection of everyone\u2019s right to believe \u2014 or not believe. In practice, however, France\u2019s roughly 5 million Muslims have felt targeted because la\u00efcit\u00e9 has mainly translated of late into laws banning head scarves in state schools and face-covering veils in public. The Collective Against Islamophobia in France has said it will file a legal complaint against the Cannes ordinance.A couple of points must be made here. It is unacceptable that some Muslim communities in Europe enjoy the freedoms of the democracies they live in without accepting the responsibility of upholding the basic values of those societies. After terrorist attacks committed in the name of Islam from Britain to Belgium to Germany to France, it cannot be that imams in European mosques preach hatred against the West or portray the liberty and equality of women as debauchery and prostitution. The French government has rightly expelled 82 preachers of such views who had been living in France.Leaders of European Muslim communities \u2014 the many Muslims who have enjoyed success and integration in Europe \u2014 need to stand up day after day and declare, loud and clear, that with the fruits of freedom come the obligations of tolerant citizenship. Paris was not built on backwardness or barbarism or misogyny. Its luminous appeal to all humanity stems from the Enlightenment. The French state, in turn, like other states, must recommit itself to combating prejudice against Muslims.That said, it is also unacceptable to ban Zanetti\u2019s burkini from beaches. A burkini is not in itself \u201ca political project,\u201d \u201ca counter-society\u201d or a symbol of women\u2019s enslavement, as Valls argued. No, it is a choice of dress reflecting a religious belief protected under the French Constitution. If anything, it is the counter-bikini.Often the choice to wear one has been imposed through forms of male domination sanctioned by certain readings of Islam and pervasive in societies like Saudi Arabia, but equally it may reflect a woman\u2019s independently embraced identity. That is not for officials to decide. Inside the burkini lurk many different women\u2019s journeys.Zanetti told Le Monde that she would like to ask a question: \u201cDo French mayors and politicians want to ban the burkini, or just Muslims?\u201d From the distant fastness of Australia that\u2019s a sharp, easy jibe. The French reality is far more difficult, requiring outreach, restraint and good sense from all sides.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tapping a Troubled Neighborhood\u2019s Inner Strength", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "Supported byFixesFirst of three articlesTen years ago, Patsy Hite, 70, rarely left her home at night. \u201cI heard a lot of sirens so I always kept to myself,\u201d she said.Hite lives in the Highlands, a 40-block section in Longview, a city in Cowlitz County in southwestern Washington. The Highlands is home to about 5,000 residents. The neighborhood is adjacent to an industrial district, and was hit hard by the loss of jobs in the timber and manufacturing industries. Long-term unemployment has brought blight, family breakdown, drug use, chronic disease, and crime.\u201cFifteen or 20 years ago, the Highlands was desolate,\u201d Patricia Thompson, a 61-year-old resident, recalled. \u201cThere was garbage and junk everywhere. There were thugs all around. You didn\u2019t feel safe walking down the street.\u201dToday, the Highlands still has high unemployment and poverty, but residents say the neighborhood has improved substantially. From 2009 to 2012, calls to the police about burglary, stolen and abandoned vehicles, domestic violence and public disturbances dropped significantly.\u201cPeople are involved with each other, not just sitting at home with their curtains closed,\u201d said Hite. \u201cI\u2019m out on the street meeting my neighbors.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s still an economically depressed area,\u201d said Thompson. \u201cThere\u2019s not many jobs here. But it\u2019s safer and more hopeful. Young people are realizing they can go to college. The main difference is that we don\u2019t leave people by themselves anymore.\u201dAt a time when poverty and economic insecurity remain widespread in the United States, how does a very poor community like the Highlands strengthen its capacity to improve itself? What does the possibility of change look like from the vantage point of ordinary citizens who care about their community, but struggle to see a path to a better future?The separation made little sense: Youths who commit violence or drug-related crimes at 17, or drop out of school at 15, often have received a first suspension in second grade and have experienced abuse or neglect as toddlers or infants. It is now understood that the best hope of interrupting this downward spiral requires yearslong collaboration between child welfare specialists, parents, educators, health workers, police officers, legal advocates and community members.In the early 1990s, Washington set up a Family Policy Council with a statewide mandate to foster integrated approaches to youth violence. It was a pioneering idea. But the council\u2019s annual budget was only $4 million \u2014 less than $1 per resident \u2014 and these problems were among the nation\u2019s toughest social challenges.\u201cThe question was: How could we make population-level changes on these problems, given the resources that we had?\u201d Laura Porter, who directed the council from 1998 to 2013, recalled. She and her colleagues chose to focus on helping cities and counties establish their own community networks. \u201cThe law said if you want to create your own local network, you can petition the state \u2014 and you get to design it and run it,\u201d she said.From 1994 to 2012, 53 communities across Washington State set up networks to address youth violence. The council helped these groups establish processes to cultivate leadership and broad partnerships, work with local citizens to set priorities and goals, use evidence to make decisions, and continue educating themselves.In the last 10 years, awareness about these experiences has proved vital to understanding the need to protect children from chronic adversity or trauma. It also provides a common framework and language within which communities can pursue mutually reinforcing strategies in related areas \u2014 education, child and family welfare, the justice system, youth development \u2014 to break intergenerational patterns of dysfunction and poverty.And the changes in the Highlands \u2014 the poorest part of Cowlitz County, with a poverty rate of 45 percent \u2014 have been particularly noteworthy.In 2006, Longview authorized a revitalization plan for the neighborhood. To shape it, city officials invoked the community network ethos of \u201cengaging the locals to identify and prioritize their own needs\u201d and went door-to-door to speak with residents, according to John Brickey, Longview\u2019s community development director.What did residents want changed? At the top of the list was the neighborhood\u2019s appearance. They wanted porch lights turned on at night, yards maintained, garbage and debris hauled away, and feral dogs rounded up. They asked the city to build a walking and biking trail along the neighborhood\u2019s south side, an area alongside a flood control ditch and industrial road that was dark and poorly maintained.\u201cThere had been so many assumptions about the Highlands,\u201d Porter recalled. \u201cOutsiders believed that the people there were dealing drugs and wanted the lights off and the dogs around to keep officials away. It turned out the residents couldn\u2019t afford light bulbs. They said, \u2018You guys think we need all this therapy, but we actually need the garbage picked up and the wild dogs cleared out.\u2019 \u201dHaeck started by eliciting leadership from residents. \u201cFor the most part, people welcomed me into their homes,\u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd I started to recognize what a wonderful community it was. We\u2019d just sit and talk. What do you want? How do you want to do it?\u201d\u201cWhen I met Liz,\u201d Hite said, \u201cshe gave me inspiration and a sense of wonder about what we could do to make things better.\u201d Hite signed on as vice president of the neighborhood association and later became president. \u201cWe started with porch lights. So many people didn\u2019t have them. We had light bulbs donated and we had a big celebration.\u201dHaeck\u2019s encouragement left residents believing that change might be possible, Hite said. Members of the neighborhood association discovered they could apply for \u2014 and win \u2014 grants. \u201cWe\u2019d get together and they\u2019d talk and I\u2019d write it down in a proposal and ask, \u2018How\u2019s this?\u2019 \u201d said Haeck. \u201cThey\u2019d read it and critique it. One resident always told me I used too many commas.\u201dThe city cobbled together funding to build the walking and biking trail. Then Highland residents purchased and renovated a community center, set up a community library, created a community garden, and organized a graffiti-removal team, block watches, and scores of neighborhood cleanups.Initially, residents were reluctant to interact with the police. But soon enough, they and police officers were gathering for monthly \u201ccop chats.\u201d \u201cWe set up a Facebook page and we asked the community to help us solve problems \u2014 and we\u2019ve been overwhelmed by the tips we\u2019ve received,\u201d Debbie Johnson, captain of Longview\u2019s Police Department, recalled. \u201cAnd there\u2019s just less opportunity for crime when neighbors watch out for each other.\u201dThe lesson: When neighbors know one another, and have a conveniently located center where they learn about health and social services, problems are more likely to be noticed by neighbors, teachers, professionals, or the police before they become crises.\u201cI was not a true believer, to be honest,\u201d said Brickey. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been amazed time and again at how the neighborhood has responded. I\u2019ve begun to see a neighborhood association as another kind of infrastructure, like the streets, water or sewer system. The health of a neighborhood is just as dependent on it.\u201dThe funding arranged to hire Haeck ran out in 2012, and since then, the neighborhood association has lost some momentum, residents say. \u201cI\u2019m concerned because some of those successes could go by the wayside unless the community finds a way to reignite the passion,\u201d said Brickey. \u201cThey\u2019re not quite ready to stand by themselves.\u201d\u201cSo many people who are living in poverty don\u2019t believe they are capable of anything,\u201d said Haeck. \u201cThis work is all about helping people to recognize that they are capable of great things, and helping them accomplish them.\u201dSince 2013, calls to the police are up again. But the higher reports may also reflect more comfort with the police and less willingness to turn a blind eye to problems, Haeck said, whether it\u2019s teenage drug use in the park or an unattended baby crying in the house across the street.\u201cI was frightened of meeting new people, because of my past,\u201d said Patricia Thompson, who is a member of the neighborhood association\u2019s board. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of people hurt me, but I\u2019m done living in a cave. People like Liz gave me the heart to help other people, and helped me learn how to help. It\u2019s a process. You can\u2019t change your neighborhood overnight.\u201d\u201cPeople can make a difference,\u201d Hite added. \u201cI got hope not only for myself but for all the neighbors. The way is to bring people together and make them stronger. That\u2019s what moves mountains.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The carrier, whose name in Dutch is Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij, merged with Air France in 2004, but the branding for the two airlines is separate.\u201cWe wanted KLM to reflect the nationality of the country,\u201d Mr. Attard said. \u201cIt\u2019s friendly and innovative.\u201dAnd the humor is self-effacing. Ken Marino, an American actor who starred in the NBC sitcom \u201cMarry Me,\u201d wryly comments on questions such as \u201cWhat is an airline?\u201d and \u201cWhat is a flight attendant?\u201d He delivers his remarks with an exaggerated sincerity intended to provoke a smile or a chuckle from social media viewers, who are the target audience of the video.The humor makes a product or service more approachable, said John Limotte, chief executive of Mustache, a video production company based in Brooklyn that worked with KLM on the campaign.\u201cIt\u2019s not a self-flattering or broadly comedic humor, but more of a charmingly clueless approach where stating the obvious is likable,\u201d he said.The approach underscores KLM\u2019s effort to solidify its American market, where it currently has eight gateways for passengers to fly directly to Amsterdam. The Dutch carrier is striving to keep its footing against competition from low-cost rivals, as well as carriers based in the Middle East that are trying to expand their service networks. And, like other airlines, KLM must contend with the impact of terrorist attacks on its leisure travel business.KLM said trans-Atlantic traffic is 15 percent of its long-haul business, and it has experienced a 7 percent increase in traffic between the United States and Europe since 2014.\u201cThe United States, for decades and in the future, serves as the backbone of our worldwide operations outside of Europe,\u201d said Pieter Elbers, KLM\u2019s president and chief executive. \u201cIt is an incredibly important market to the company.\u201dLast year, KLM expanded its business between Amsterdam, Atlanta and Los Angeles, and began direct service between Salt Lake City and Amsterdam this year. In November, the carrier plans to introduce direct service between Amsterdam and Miami.The airline must first ensure that American travelers know what it is. The company commissioned a consumer awareness survey two years ago to gauge familiarity with its brand. The survey, conducted by phone and in person at airports, found that potential customers did not have a clear idea that KLM was an airline, Mr. Attard said.One reason could be that KLM and Air France partner with Delta Air Lines on trans-Atlantic flights, so tickets show Delta\u2019s name first. The Dutch carrier\u2019s name was little seen in the United States for years because of a joint venture from 1997 to 2009 with Northwest Airlines, which handled sales in North America. That ended after Northwest\u2019s merger with Delta.Currently, KLM and Air France \u2014 members of the SkyTeam global airline alliance \u2014 offer a points program called Flying Blue but market their brands individually. To distinguish KLM\u2019s separate identity, the carrier decided to refresh its brand: It retained its blue letters on a white background and longstanding logo, a crown, but enlarged it.Mustache developed four brand identity videos with the low-key, droll humor KLM was seeking. The creative agency drew attention to its understated humor with its award-winning 2014 travel video series on the Netherlands, called \u201cHolland. The Original Cool.\u201d The first video in the series received more than a million views on YouTube.Humor in advertising is appealing \u201cbecause the entertainment aspect is the hook to get people to watch,\u201d said Michael Lewis, an associate professor of marketing at Emory University\u2019s Goizueta Business School.\u201cIt gives legitimacy to a brand that\u2019s less familiar,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is more important for KLM than for carriers like Air France or British Airways, which have the country in their name.\u201dMr. Lewis added: \u201cBut while differentiating brands has been a holy grail for airlines, more consumers are viewing the airline trip as a commodity product. It\u2019s the ability to go to point A, then to point B, except, perhaps, for frequent fliers who still want to have access to upgrades and airport lounges.\u201dMr. Attard, however, said market research showed a perceptional difference between KLM and Air France, which he said was viewed as snobbish and expensive. KLM wanted to underscore its innovation, which the airline had demonstrated through a partnership with Facebook that enabled booking flights via the Messenger app, he said.KLM\u2019s new campaign will appear on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, as well as on a site, ItsAnAirline.com. It will feature interactive elements, including letting visitors earn loyalty points by finding hidden objects.Because of an editing error, an article on Monday about an advertising campaign for KLM, the Dutch airline, referred incorrectly to its official name. The airline is formally known as Royal Dutch Airlines, not \u201cformerly\u201d known as such.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Black Health Matters", "Date": "2016-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst PersonThe first bloom appeared in the crease of my right elbow, an itchy cluster that I ignored. It was well into summer, so I wrote it off as heat rash, or something similarly seasonal.But then it started to spread. The topography of my body transformed into a foreign mess of hives and scaly patches.I had just come back from Puerto Rico, but my doctor ruled out Zika. Dermatologists were baffled. Allergy panels came back negative. Relief was fleeting: My skin would heal for a few days, only to burst back into a weeping rash.I spent the first few weeks of summer on my couch, comatose under the influence of prescription-strength antihistamines. Not long after, an extended heavy menstrual cycle left me feeling so ill and lightheaded that I almost fainted at work, alarming my co-worker Sue so much that she escorted me to an emergency room.Again, doctors found nothing they could pinpoint as the culprit. My acupuncturist was the first to suggest a potential trigger: Could my rash be stress-induced, he asked kindly, as he slid needles into my face and arms.All the rage and mourning and angst works to exhaust you; it eats you alive with its relentlessness. These slayings obey no humane logic. They force you to reconcile your own helplessness in the face of such brutal injustice, and the terrifying reality that it could happen to you, or someone you hold dear.These included acupuncture, herbal remedies, group meditation and dance classes, and the ones I attended felt lifesaving. I contacted Ms. Leigh to find out more about her programming. She said the need to care for the black body felt like \u201can emergency.\u201dMs. Leigh cites, as inspiration, the community health efforts of the Black Panther Party and a network of black female nurses who have been working since the days of the Underground Railroad.Ms. Leigh\u2019s work is carried out in the black radical tradition, one that declares that holistic health care is not a luxury, but rather an act of resilience, survival and disobedience \u2014 a necessity. \u201cIf you can\u2019t be a human being in public, you take it to a private place,\u201d she said.Making space to deal with the psychological toll of racism is absolutely necessary. In the aftermath of the deaths of Ms. Gaines, Mr. Sterling and Mr. Castile, I found myself sick with grief and astonished at how little it seemed to affect my white peers and colleagues.\u201cWe don\u2019t even have the empathy for ourselves,\u201d Ms. Leigh said mournfully.It\u2019s becoming much more common to see yoga studios offer classes aimed exclusively at people of color who are searching for ways to cope with racism and fears around police brutality.The class I attended was overflowing with black and brown bodies of all types, and began with a small ceremony to acknowledge those whose lives were lost. That recognition nearly brought me to tears. And the relief came from the affirmation that I wasn\u2019t the only person suffering. The room was at capacity.\u201cI was having a traumatic response, and I couldn\u2019t force anything,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really drove home the need for this space. Inside of the trauma, there\u2019s a desire for connection.\u201dA few days later, Dara Cole, the owner of Sacred, sent a note to her teachers, asking if anyone was willing to participate in a week of healing sessions. \u201cThe response was overwhelming,\u201d Ms. Benson said. \u201cEvery idea made it a class in that series.\u201dMs. Benson pointed out that Ms. Cole is a white woman, and that she led by example of how white people can support black people by \u201clistening when we\u2019re speaking about our experiences.\u201dMs. Leigh\u2019s residency ends in September, and Sacred\u2019s programming wrapped up in August. Both women said they felt the need for more, the demand is just that high.The cause of my rash is still a mystery. But I\u2019m thankful that it\u2019s dormant for now, and balance has largely been restored, however temporarily. My wellness strategy now includes more yoga and acupuncture, to fully embody the urgency that Ms. Leigh felt when she told me, \u201cWe need to step up the care to match the stress.\u201dJenna Wortham is a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine.Advertisement"}

She shrewdly notes that our fascination with vanishing is only heightened by the \u201chypervisibility of our age.\u201d Is it even possible to disappear anymore, she wonders, when \u201cevery move is monitored, if not by the National Security Agency then by closed-circuit TVs and drones, phones transmitting our coordinates, and obnoxious friends tagging us on Facebook?\u201dOne investigator calls staged deaths an \u201coutlier\u201d in the insurance-fraud game, making up maybe 1 percent of the cases. Ms. Greenwood\u2019s research reveals that death fraud is a \u201cheavily male phenomenon.\u201d Men looking to disappear tend to have money problems; when it\u2019s women, they tend to have violent-man problems.Some of the fundamental tasks on the offing-yourself checklist are more easily accomplished than you might think. For instance: producing a body. A relatively robust number of morgues are in the sales business, especially in places where corpse security is a low priority. Steve Rambam, a fraud investigator, is quoted as saying: \u201cYou can just go into any city morgue in almost any developing country, ask to see the unclaimed bodies, and cry, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s poor Uncle Marco!\u2019 They\u2019ll be happy to get a body off their hands.\u201dEven Ms. Greenwood\u2019s suspicion that technology makes the job harder isn\u2019t that simple. \u201cThe internet is a double-edged sword,\u201d Mr. Ahearn tells her. \u201cIt all comes down to who\u2019s better at it: the person looking or the person disappearing?\u201dThe book\u2019s centerpiece is a profile of John Darwin, a British man who intentionally disappeared while kayaking in 2002, to escape debt and come into insurance money. He resurfaced in 2007, claiming to have amnesia. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to overstate John Darwin\u2019s pop-culture cachet in the United Kingdom,\u201d Ms. Greenwood writes. She met Mr. Darwin and interviewed him about his plot, and whether he regrets the emotional toll his scheme took on his grown sons, who believed him dead. (Mr. Darwin\u2019s wife was in on the trick.)Less coherent is a chapter on people who believe that Michael Jackson is still among us. While these believers are certainly entertaining \u2014 one of them says, \u201cThis is about Michael trying to stop World War III and the people who continually gain more control over us\u201d; another believes that one of Jackson\u2019s lyrics hints that he would reappear in 2012, at the end of the Mayan calendar \u2014 they belong in a different book. Those who picture the King of Pop, Elvis, Princess Diana and Andy Kaufman having brunch in a diner somewhere are nuts in a qualitatively different way from people who fake their own deaths. Dedicating a long chapter to them in \u201cPlaying Dead,\u201d rather than a few paragraphs, feels like padding.The fun in Greenwood\u2019s book \u2014 much of it admittedly grim fun \u2014 is in learning the details: the method Los Angeles uses to dispose of its 1,500 or so unclaimed bodies each year; the fact that imaginary people were created to have \u201cdied\u201d in the Sept. 11 attacks for insurance purposes; the man who is pulled over for speeding just a few days after \u201cdrowning.\u201d (If you\u2019re in this game, relocate somewhere with public transportation; motor vehicles seem to be the equivalent of Al Capone\u2019s taxes for the fake dead.)The book\u2019s weakness is in its frame. Ms. Greenwood sells us the project as an investigation and survey spurred by her own desire to fake her death. That desire may have been real, but these pages don\u2019t convince us of it. Yes, she was in debt, but never does one sense she actually believed that the momentous consequences and dangers of her decision would be anywhere near worth the corresponding debt relief.

She comes across as simply a writer interested in a fascinating subject, which is enough.Near the end of the book, she runs down several of the most fundamental suggestions in just a few paragraphs that can be taped to the computer screen of anyone doing their own research: Don\u2019t stage a drowning.

{"Headline": "Olympic Cover-Up: Why You Won\u2019t See Some Shoe Logos", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The track and field events at the Rio Olympics this month will showcase elite athletic talent and, if you look closely, creative subterfuge.Tape, markers, elastic sleeves and maybe even paint will disguise some shoe brand logos in an Olympic sleight of foot.In track and field, the centerpiece sport of the Summer Games, shoes are the most vital piece of equipment and serve purposes beyond performance: supplying advertising billboards for apparel companies and providing financial footing for athletes. But some athletes do not want the world to see the logos on their shoes, or they are prohibited from doing so by their sponsors if they wear competing brands.Although United States track and field athletes at the Rio Games must wear uniforms bearing the familiar swoosh of Nike, an official team sponsor, they are free to wear their own brand of shoes, disguised or not.Take, for example, Jeremy Taiwo, a decathlete from Seattle who will wear eight pairs of shoes in his 10 events, each with a function as specific as a golf club\u2019s.His shoe sponsor is Brooks, but the company does not make shoes designed for throwing and jumping events. So Taiwo also plans to wear shoes made by Nike, Adidas and Asics. He must cover the logos of those competing brands, which he plans to do with tape, elastic sleeves and cleverly shaded fabric.\u201cIn terms of athletic performance, you have to have the right shoes to be able to meet your goals,\u201d Taiwo, 26, said in a telephone interview before traveling to Rio de Janeiro. \u201cAnd ultimately, you have to do well so you can get paid. If you make it, your shoes are largely responsible for that.\u201dThe camouflaging demonstrates the power of the $75 billion global athletic footwear industry, which closely monitors what athletes wear \u2014 and, with lawyers at its beck and call, what they do not.Although it is unclear how many athletes will be disguising their footwear at the Games, the practice is not uncommon at track meets, with the reasons for the cover-ups almost as varied as the shoes available.Athletes who have no shoe sponsor may not want to give free advertising to any company, preferring to signal that they are free agents. Taiwo called this an act of \u201cno representation without compensation.\u201dOther athletes disguise shoes because they are transitioning from one company to another and are continuing to wear their old shoes while new ones are being perfected. Some, like Taiwo, participate in events for which their sponsor does not make shoes. Some athletes are simply dissatisfied with the gear made by their sponsor.Sometimes, shoe companies give permission for athletes to wear another, disguised brand. Other times, they take umbrage, and the controversy becomes public.Nike did not say why the contract offer was rescinded, only that Walker \u201cdid not take up this option in a timely manner.\u201d Walker put his gear up for sale on eBay.Mike Hazle, the 2011 American champion in the javelin, said his Nike-made shoes were too narrow, causing his toenails to fall off and his feet to become numb. So for years, he said, he borrowed gear made by Asics and Li-Ning, a Chinese company, from a fellow javelin thrower. He covered those logos with tape or with slices from wristbands that bore the Nike swoosh.It was never a problem in the little-noticed event, Hazle said, until he won the United States title and a photograph of him appeared in Track & Field News. His left foot was raised after a throw, revealing the check-mark logo of Li-Ning on the bottom of his shoe.Nike was not pleased and exercised an option on his contract in 2012 to keep him from signing with another company, Hazle said, but offered only $10,000 with no chance of bonuses.It is unfortunate \u201cif someone is paying your bills and you\u2019re supposed to wear what they give you and it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Hazle said from Afghanistan, where he is serving in the Air National Guard. \u201cBut at the end of the day, it\u2019s going to compromise your performance, so you\u2019ve got to take care of yourself.\u201dNike said it did not comment on contracts but expected that its sponsored athletes \u201cwill always wear Nike products unless there is some specific, mutually agreed exception.\u201dOne high-profile exception took place last year. Christian Taylor of the United States, who won the triple jump at the 2012 Olympics and signed with Nike in 2015, was permitted to wear Adidas shoes at the world track and field championships in Beijing while Nike customized shoes for him. Taylor, the triple jump favorite at this year\u2019s Olympics, now wears Nikes.Two medal favorites in the high jump, Mutaz Essa Barshim of Qatar and Derek Drouin of Canada, have also been permitted by Nike to wear shoes from other brands that are covered by elastic sleeves resembling spats that bear the Nike swoosh.\u201cAs with any athlete, we are working closely with them to get the shoe that best suits their specific needs,\u201d Charlie Brooks, a Nike spokesman, said in an email. \u201cThere\u2019s no issue with our shoes; it\u2019s just a matter of personal customization for these athletes. We anticipate they\u2019ll be jumping in Nike shoes soon.\u201dCamouflaging reflects the particular nature of track and field, which finds itself in the limelight every four years during the Summer Games.Sprinters, pole-vaulters and steeplechasers generally do not receive annual salaries from teams the way professional football and basketball players do. Instead, they mostly rely on prize money and contracts with shoe companies, along with other endorsements.The apparel companies, Nike in particular, wield strong influence. They equip athletes and keep the struggling sport afloat. But they can also reduce payments when certain performance goals are not met. And at certain meets like the Olympics, athletes are restricted from wearing competing sponsor logos on their uniforms and as temporary tattoos.The number of track meets is dwindling, as are the available prize money and appearance fees, athletes and agents say. Rampant doping has threatened the legitimacy of the sport. Income disparity is wide.Carl Lewis, a nine-time Olympic gold medalist who has had a long affiliation with Nike, said the camouflaging of shoes was \u201ca microcosm of what the real issue is: Are we really creating a professional sport?\u201d\u201cWhy are we so dependent on just shoe companies?\u201d said Lewis, an assistant coach at the University of Houston.Some athletes said they considered it disrespectful and unprofessional to cover up the logo of a sponsor.\u201cIf they\u2019re paying money, the least we can do is respect their dollar,\u201d said Wallace Spearmon of the United States, a 200-meter sprinter and a former Nike athlete.Other athletes owe no allegiance because they have no shoe sponsor.Johnny Dutch of the United States has run the fastest time in the world this year in the 400-meter hurdles. But he said he had been without a shoe sponsor for three years, since his Nike contract ended. At the Olympic track and field trials in July in Eugene, Ore., Dutch wore shoes that were spray-painted neon orange to cover the logos of Nike and two other brands.This was done, in part, to express his artistic side, said Dutch, 27, an aspiring filmmaker. But it was also his way of saying that, for him to display any shoe company logo, \u201cthey\u2019ve got to support me,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to give me something where I can live and pay my medical bills.\u201dMoney had become so tight, Dutch said, that he had moved from Miami to live with his parents in Raleigh, N.C. His chance to gain visibility and financial buoyancy as an Olympian disappeared when Dutch clipped the final hurdle in the 400-meter hurdles at the trials and faded from first place to fifth.Only the top three advanced to Rio. Disconsolate, Dutch said he intended to retire.\u201cI feel like I can\u2019t do this no more,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI\u2019ve been struggling financially. I don\u2019t have a contract. I have no job.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "With a Very Public Alarm, the Strawberry-Gooden Story Continues", "Date": "2016-08-24", "News": "Supported byOn BaseballThe question unsettled Strawberry, who, like Gooden, is a recovering addict. They were teammates on the Mets in the 1980s but were never really close friends. The station invited them to speak in part because of their parallel lives, which were explored last month in an ESPN documentary, \u201cDoc & Darryl.\u201dStrawberry seemed to be weighing an answer that would turn a private medical matter into a public cause.He hesitated before answering, he said in an interview Wednesday, because he knew Gooden was in trouble. He was also reflecting on his wife, Tracy, and others \u201cpulling me out of dope houses.\u201d He told the audience: \u201cMy fear is that \u2014 and I know addiction \u2014 and my fear is that people who don\u2019t change, they die. They die this way. I just hope the light comes on soon before it\u2019s too late.\u201dSince then, in comments made largely to The Daily News and the SNY network, Strawberry has escalated his concern into an uncomfortable public intervention designed to persuade Gooden to seek help.On Monday, he told SNY: \u201cIf no one speaks about it, he will be a tragedy; he will be an ESPN headline; he will be like Prince or Michael Jordan or Whitney Houston\u201d \u2014 clearly intending to say \u201cMichael Jackson.\u201d Joining Strawberry in the campaign has been Janice Roots, identified by The Daily News as a former live-in girlfriend of Gooden\u2019s, who said he had turned into a \u201ccocaine monster.\u201dThe spectacle has yielded one heartbreaking Daily News front-page headline, \u201cFears for Doc\u2019s Life,\u201d after another, \u201cAt Death\u2019s Door Step\u201d (which was accompanied by a photograph of a rail-thin Gooden outside his apartment in Jersey City). Gooden has denied having relapsed and has questioned Strawberry\u2019s exhorting him publicly to seek help. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s no friendship,\u201d Gooden told The Daily News, and \u201cbad judgment on my part thinking it was.\u201dHe tried to dispel concerns about his health Monday on Joe Piscopo\u2019s radio show. \u201cI am healthy,\u201d he said. \u201cI am an addict, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m an active addict.\u201d On Tuesday, before a Steiner Sports event, Gooden said on Facebook that he had been dealing with depression caused by his mother\u2019s illness and recent death.The melodrama might be compelling to fans of both men, but Strawberry\u2019s decision to go public about Gooden was wrong, said Dr. Harry Haroutunian, physician director at the Betty Ford Center. Strawberry\u2019s campaign is a rebuke of the privacy promised in Alcoholics Anonymous and suggests that \u201csomeone get up and grab on to the pillory and confess to the world that they\u2019ve relapsed,\u201d Haroutunian said in an interview Tuesday.\u201cThey\u2019re doing this in public?\u201d he said. \u201cWow. It just makes no sense to me. This is a disease with enough shame surrounding it.\u201d Told that Strawberry is a minister and had co-founded two substance abuse recovery centers in Florida, he said: \u201cOh, dear. There but for the grace of God go I. Part of the 12-step process is making amends and changing your life, but you do that by setting a good example, not proselytizing.\u201dHaroutunian added: \u201cI can\u2019t speak to his motivation for asking Gooden to do this, but Strawberry was a hard case. He was really sick, and maybe he is a miracle in his own right. But flogging someone in the town square \u2014 which may not be his intent \u2014 has never been a process that I\u2019ve seen a great deal of merit in. People need to be loved and supported and nursed back to health.\u201dBut Strawberry said he felt that Gooden would go to rehabilitation if more people knew he had relapsed.\u201cThe problem with staying private is that people die,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one wants to say anything when they see a loved one in the midst of addiction. It\u2019s not embarrassing to expose the disease of addiction. We\u2019re exposing the disease, not Dwight Gooden. If people pleading for him to get help will resonate with him, fine.\u201dGooden and Strawberry appeared to have found common ground in \u201cDoc & Darryl,\u201d which recalled how the careers of two sensational young Mets who played on the World Series team of 1986 were derailed by substance abuse. They willingly discussed their addictions, but Strawberry appeared to be healthier and more comfortable in his recovery.The documentary handled Gooden with great delicacy, never saying he might have had a relapse, but his nervous demeanor and thin physique suggested that he might have been in trouble during the filming last year.Michael Bonfiglio, one of the directors, said in a telephone interview from West Virginia on Tuesday that Gooden had displayed no addictive behavior and had been on time for all the interviews. But, he added, he was aware once production began that Strawberry and others had been privately urging Gooden to get help.\u201cIf you look at Darryl\u2019s original comments, they didn\u2019t strike me as making a planned decision to do this but was a spur-of-the-moment thing,\u201d Bonfiglio said.\u201cMy gut would be that the reason Darryl went public was out of frustration. Whether it was a miscalculation or not, it hasn\u2019t had the result that Darryl and many people want. But I think the intention behind it was to change the way many have enabled a situation that Darryl feels should not have been enabled.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misspelled the given name of the former Met shown with Dwight Gooden. He is Darryl Strawberry, not Daryl.Advertisement"}

No go! But Will liked the theme and other entries, so I kept at it, aiming more for \u201cchuckle value\u201d in the theme answers than complexity.I see that this puzzle has an appallingly low \u201cfreshness factor,\u201d (I think a record low for me) so it should play fairly easily.

My original had SSNS at 19-Across, and I know better than that now: don\u2019t pluralize abbreviations if you can at all avoid it! I\u2019m also becoming much more averse to partials and abbreviations in general.One note about what I\u2019ve seen evolve with themed puzzles in the last few years: The grid should feature at least two, if not four, lengthy non-theme Down entries (10 or 11 letters) crossing through two or three themers to keep the word count down and spice up the fill.

At the same time, we fulfill our mission to report and illuminate the harsh realities of places where very few outsiders will ever go.The intractable war in Syria is \u201ca geopolitical problem that you have to keep in front of people,\u201d says Beth Flynn, a deputy director of photography at The Times.\u201cWe could easily publish a photo of an injured or dead Syrian child every day,\u201d says photo editor Karen Cetinkaya. \u201cBut we try to be conscious of the reader\u2019s tolerance for such strong imagery. That said, we regularly put photos of the carnage in Syria into the mix of choices for the front page whether we have a daily story from the region or not, because it\u2019s important that these people not be forgotten. Their situation is so harrowing and it\u2019s been going on for so long with no end in sight.\u201dMeaghan Looram, a deputy director of photography, concurs that the photos may transcend the written words available on a given day: \u201cOften, we bring photographs like these to the attention of the masthead editors and make a case for the photograph being published as a stand-alone image, independent of any story. This is often the case with photographs from Syria that demonstrate the toll of the conflict on civilians.\u201cA thoughtful discussion between the photo editor and masthead editors precedes the final decision on images,\u201d she adds, \u201ctaking into account the mix of news of that day and the newsworthiness, emotional impact and aesthetic strength of the photographs in question.\u201dFar too many of the photographs taken after airstrikes in hospitals and amid collapsed buildings are gruesome. The Omran picture delivers a shock to the conscience but also strikes a balance between delivering a sharp message and being too difficult to view. It is compelling but not grisly; it can enter an Instagram feed or a Facebook wall, arouse sympathy, be shared and allow the viewer to move on without seeing the absolute worst of what war has to offer.Indelible images from the past \u2014 the flag-raising at Iwo Jima photographed by Joe Rosenthal, the execution of a Viet Cong taken by Eddie Adams, the myriad conflict images by photographers like James Nachtwey and Don McCullin \u2014 were published first in newspapers and magazines. Today, news organizations can be entirely bypassed; an image can slingshot around the world on social media without being published by a traditional media outlet. The democratization of information afforded by the internet can be wonderful, but also can be a double-edged sword. Images and words that have been crafted by responsible and careful journalists sometimes share a level playing field with ones that have not been vetted at all.In the end, though, shining a light on the world\u2019s most immiserated places \u2014 whether through traditional news organizations like The Times or through social media \u2014 is an important act. Many of us have become inured to the suffering in places like Aleppo. Sometimes it takes an image like this to rattle us awake.Follow Craig Allen on Twitter @Craig_D_Allen.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018The Birth of a Nation,\u2019 Nate Parker\u2019s Heralded Film, Is Now Cloaked in Controversy", "Date": "2016-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 It was supposed to be a corrective to #OscarsSoWhite. The blistering story of a slave revolt that was directed and written by a black artist, Nate Parker, who also stars in the lead role, \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d had been positioned as a balm for an industry long criticized for sidelining minorities.Instead, the film has become clouded by the disclosure of tragic details in a nearly two-decade-old case in which Mr. Parker was accused \u2014 and later acquitted \u2014 of raping a fellow student while at Penn State. The episode was already known, including by the studio backing the film, but on Tuesday Variety gave it new life by revealing that Mr. Parker\u2019s accuser committed suicide in 2012 at the age of 30.And the controversy may worsen: As more people will discover when they see the film, which is scheduled to open on Oct. 7 in more than 1,500 theaters, Mr. Parker\u2019s script uses gang rape as a central story point, though the attack is not explicitly shown. The film looks at the slave revolt Turner led in Virginia in 1831, but a storytelling device \u2014 the brutal assault by white men on Turner\u2019s wife \u2014 feeds a rage that sets the rebellion in motion.Members of Mr. Parker\u2019s team of Hollywood advisers also privately worried on Wednesday that additional details about the 1999 case, including that his accuser was white, could emerge as new flash points.Until now, \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d has been the leading Oscar contender. Discussing awards may seem in poor taste, especially in light of the rape case, but it is impossible to separate the Oscars from Mr. Parker\u2019s film. Four longtime awards strategists, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the supercharged nature of the controversy, said in interviews that \u2014 at least as things stood on Wednesday \u2014 \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d was gravely damaged as an awards prospect.Fox Searchlight has repeatedly said over the years that it does not make distribution decisions based on awards potential, but traction on the Oscar circuit, and the free publicity it brings, can nonetheless mean the difference between a financial hit and a miss. To justify the price it paid for the film, Searchlight must sell at least $50 million in tickets, box office analysts say. A Searchlight spokeswoman declined to comment on Wednesday, directing a reporter to a statement released on Friday. \u201cWe stand behind Nate and are proud to help bring this important and powerful story to the screen,\u201d the statement read in part, taking care to note Mr. Parker\u2019s acquittal.Three people working on the film\u2019s release, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the nature of the controversy, insisted that Searchlight had no plans to back away from its release plan, which would have Mr. Parker touring colleges and churches in the coming month.These people said that they had no evidence, so far, to suggest that the firestorm surrounding Mr. Parker had been lit through whispers by competing studios, as sometimes is the case in Hollywood. The woman\u2019s family sounded less convinced in a statement to The New York Times on Tuesday, which read in part, \u201cWe are dubious of the underlying motivations that bring this to present light after 17 years.\u201dMr. Parker\u2019s Facebook message, posted on Tuesday night, only appeared to inflame the situation. It was flooded with more than 500 responses, mostly from women and mostly harshly critical after learning of details about the case.Some called to boycott the film. \u201cI refuse to give you my money,\u201d wrote one Facebook user, Brynne Walker. Others condemned Mr. Parker, but said they would still support the movie. \u201cThe story needs to be told and seen,\u201d Imani Jackson Rosario wrote. \u201cBut what you did to that girl is horrible.\u201dMr. Parker and his roommate, Jean McGianni Celestin (who shares a story credit on \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d), were brought to trial in 2001. In testimony, the woman said that in August 1999 she passed out at Mr. Parker\u2019s apartment after a night of drinking \u2014 they had had consensual oral sex the day before \u2014 and awoke intermittently to find first Mr. Parker having intercourse with her, and then Mr. Celestin\u2019s penis in her mouth. The next day, she testified: \u201cI was in too much pain. I couldn\u2019t walk.\u201d In written statements read in court, both Mr. Parker and Mr. Celestin said that the young woman was lucid and consenting throughout the encounter.A friend of the two men, Tamerlane Kangas, who was visiting them the night of the incident, testified that Mr. Parker beckoned for Mr. Kangas and Mr. Celestin to join him with the woman in sex. After Mr. Celestin did, Mr. Kangas watched them switch positions with her \u2014 Mr. Kangas testified that he did not see her move \u2014 and left.The woman also claimed that she was repeatedly harassed after filing charges, and sued Penn State for failing to protect her. The case was settled for $17,500. Mr. Parker was acquitted of the charges, but Mr. Celestin was convicted of sexual assault, though that verdict was later overturned.Both Mr. Parker and the woman came from strikingly similar and largely unpromising backgrounds. Mr. Parker\u2019s father died when he was 11, and he grew up in a housing project in Norfolk, Va. \u2014 \u201crats and cinder blocks,\u201d he said in an interview on Saturday. He won a full wrestling scholarship for Penn State, though after the rape case he transferred to the University of Oklahoma.The woman\u2019s father left the family when she was 11, and at 15, according to court records, she and two of her three siblings were removed from her mother and placed in foster care. She did well in high school, skipping 11th grade and winning a scholarship. A sister, Sharon Loeffler, said that landing at Penn State had given her a chance at a future, though she had bouts of depression before the rape case. She dropped out of school a few months later, according to the lawsuit she filed against Penn State, and said the harassment that followed her filing charges prompted two suicide attempts.The revelations about her suicide spurred anguished and angry responses from several black writers, with many saying that Mr. Parker\u2019s initial responses to the case \u2014 noting his acquittal in 2001 \u2014 came off as sorely lacking.It is unclear whether Searchlight knew about Mr. Parker\u2019s past when it made its bid. \u201cUnder pressure at a film festival to close a highly competitive deal that was consummated in a day of heated negotiation, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not uppermost on a company\u2019s mind,\u201d Eamonn Bowles, president of Magnolia Pictures, an independent film company, said in an email.\u201c\u2018The Birth of a Nation\u2019 scenario is an extreme rarity,\u201d he added. \u201cA company tries to prepare itself for possible scenarios, but you can\u2019t cover everything.\u201dAn article on Thursday about controversy surrounding the coming film \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d after the disclosure of new details about a nearly two-decade-old case in which the film\u2019s director, writer and star, Nate Parker, was charged with rape misstated, in some editions, the year he was acquitted. It was 15 years ago \u2014 not 17 years ago, which was when he was initially charged, in 1999.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Charming Alternative Universe of You, Your Friends and No News", "Date": "2016-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThis column is about escapist social networks, but let\u2019s start with Donald J. Trump because he seems more or less inescapable right now.In the few weeks since the introduction of Stories, Instagram seems to be on the path to becoming a different kind of place \u2014 a network where you can experience the most intimate and endearing moments of your friends\u2019 and acquaintances\u2019 lives in an environment blessedly free of the news.These are among a handful of apps that are creating a charming alternative universe online \u2014 a welcome form of earnest, escapist entertainment that makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside, in a way that recalls an earlier epoch in carefree internet socializing.\u201cThe irony is that if you\u2019d asked people in 2008 about Facebook, they would have said the same thing \u2014 that Facebook was the first thing that felt raw, personal and emotional rather than, \u2018Here\u2019s a link to another story about Donald Trump,\u2019\u201d said Josh Elman, a partner at the venture capital firm Greylock Partners. He has worked at Twitter and Facebook and is an investor in social apps including Musical.ly.But as Facebook became more popular, Mr. Elman said, it started to feel less reflexively \u201csafe.\u201d The more people who were on it, the more you had to pause to consider who and where your message was going out to and what the countless people who\u2019d be able to see it forever might think of you.That stands in stark contrast to some other social apps now. Take Snapchat, whose growth has been fueled by an insistence on authenticity. The app began in 2011 as a way to send pictures that disappear, a feature that lowered people\u2019s inhibitions (sometimes in worrying ways) and created a mind-set of pervasive, disarming goofiness.In 2013, Snapchat created Stories, which lets you turn your disappearing pictures into a kind of journal that would be displayed on your followers\u2019 timelines.Stories works like this: As you go about your day, you might snap a shot of yourself eating breakfast, walking the dog, going to work, making some dumb joke in the mirror or otherwise having a grand old time. Each of these sounds banal, but because the diaries expire after a day, and because it\u2019s video rather than text, people tend to be forthcoming about their lives \u2014 so you get a very intense, close connection with people of the sort that feels rare online.The differences are instructive. On Facebook, my friends will post about their promotions; on Snapchat, they tell you about their anxieties at work. On Facebook, they show off smiling photos of their perfect kids on some perfect vacation. On Snapchat, they show pictures of their kids in the midst of some disastrous tantrum, throwing food all over the floor, peeing in the tub, covered in mud and paint and food, because hey, that\u2019s life, O.K.?Kevin Systrom, one of Instagram\u2019s founders and its chief executive, told me that his company, which Facebook purchased in 2012, had long aspired to capture every moment of people\u2019s lives \u2014 both the showy ones and the casual, tossed-off moments in between. But the culture on Instagram, he said, was constrained by growth.\u201cAs we got bigger and bigger and bigger, people got more and more followers, including people you don\u2019t know following you,\u201d Mr. Systrom said. \u201cThen you have brands and celebrities posting more and more awesome photos. And you start to say to yourself: \u2018Can I exist in that world? Is this world right for me?\u2019\u201dThough Stories is only a few weeks old, I have already learned a lot about my friends. It turns out they do not live in perfect houses \u2014 some of theirs are as messy as mine \u2014 and don\u2019t always have perfectly combed hair. They don\u2019t always get things done; they sometimes eat less than stellar-looking food; their kids sometimes misbehave just as much as mine.Mr. Systrom had a similar verdict. \u201cI feel like I get to see all these people I\u2019ve known all these years, but now I actually get to hear from them and see what they do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just their beautiful photos, but it\u2019s who they are.\u201dWhether this lasts is another question. Instagram has 500 million users around the world, 300 million of whom use the app every day. Snapchat has 150 million daily active users. As these networks grow ever larger, even disappearing photos will be subject to anxiety \u2014 and people could well move on to other services where they feel more protected to show off their true selves.\u201cGive it a couple months, watch other people\u2019s stories, and then you\u2019re going to be like: \u2018Hmm, my kid threw up, I had to clean it up, I finally got her to bed and now I\u2019m just on the couch watching TV \u2014 I\u2019m just not going to share that,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Elman at Greylock. \u201cBecause your five other friends posted pictures from some great concert at the beach, and you can\u2019t compete.\u201dFor now, at least, I\u2019m enjoying watching people let their freak flag fly. In a strange way, loading up these escapist apps and watching friends and strangers act the fool feels wonderfully carefree, like a throwback to another old-fashioned pastime that has been outmoded by technology: channel-surfing on TV.There\u2019s a constant reality show on your phone, but an honest one, starring your friends. And Mr. Trump is nowhere to be found.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "On Argentina Plains, Hunters Feel Besieged by Critics \u2018Made of Asphalt\u2019", "Date": "2016-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUtrac\u00e1n JournalUTRAC\u00c1N, Argentina \u2014 After days in the wilderness, the hunters drove up to the sports club in rusty pickup trucks with carcasses of wild boars splayed on their roofs. One by one, the dead boars were heaved onto a bloodied crane scale, then lined up on planks, their snouts wedged open.Boar hunting in the remote, semiarid county of Utrac\u00e1n has endured for generations. Older huntsmen reminisce about their first forays into the thorny scrubland by moonlight; boys imitate their fathers\u2019 strides across vast plains as they follow packs of brawny mastiffs.Yet threats to that tradition are emerging as animal rights activists, buoyed by their growing clout in recent years, say the time has come to put an end to the hunts.\u201cPeople used to look at us like heroes,\u201d said Daniel Briguez, a 43-year-old construction site manager, who had a hunting knife strapped to his waist. \u201cToday, we\u2019re a nuisance.\u201dThe hunters bristle at such comments, saying they are under attack from critics often cocooned in distant cities.After feasting on marinated wild viscacha, a large rodent, on a recent night, Mr. Alfonso sat by the hearth of a remote farmhouse in Utrac\u00e1n, where La Pampa\u2019s crop fields and pastures begin to give way to expanses of wild lands interspersed by humble towns. His companions had gone off looking for boar tracks.With the skull of a puma looking down from the fireplace beside him, Mr. Alfonso laid out his view of the world.\u201cLa Pampa was shaped by rural men \u2014 lumberjacks clearing tracks in the forest, cattle drovers and fencers,\u201d he said, holding a hunting knife whose handle was carved from deer antlers. \u201cIf you\u2019re from the city, you\u2019re made of asphalt, sidewalks and the internet.\u201dIn many ways, Mr. Briguez epitomizes the passion of the hunters. He escapes as often as he can from the provincial capital of Santa Rosa along undulating sand tracks to hunting grounds in his 1999 Ford pickup. He will hunt through the night, then drive back home for a snooze on the sofa before another day at the construction site.The hunters, who cure much of the boar meat to eat at home, also emphasize the service they provide to the province\u2019s farmers by protecting their corn crops from foraging boars.Numbers are vague, but one study from 2009 estimated there were about 2,700 boars in just one part of Argentina\u2019s central steppe.The farmers often hire the huntsmen to cull the boars. There is a similar dynamic at play in Texas and Florida, where boars are said to have been introduced by Spanish conquistadors.\u201cThey damage both biodiversity and the agricultural economy,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Fernanda Cuevas, a biologist who researches the ecology of wild boars in Argentina. \u201cThe only solution to truly dissuade them is to hunt.\u201dBut even as supporters of hunting advance ecological as well as cultural arguments, opponents point to a tug of narratives extending beyond provincial borders.The carcasses of wild boars at a hunting tournament in Santa Rosa, La Pampa Province, Argentina.\u201cAll they see is the act of killing,\u201d said Luciano Beloqui, 35, a bearded former village mayor who prefers hunting with a telescopic rifle from stakeouts among the barbed cha\u00f1ar and piquill\u00edn shrubs.Carrying his young son in his arms, Mr. Beloqui traced a progression in villages like his, Quehu\u00e9, where he said children who used to take aim at birds with slingshots today hunt boars. As a mayor, he sought to raise awareness of the rural heritage; now, he said, \u201cWe must redouble our efforts.\u201dNow, the boar hunters fear that increasingly strict regulations imperil their tradition.For instance, a 2012 norm outlaws boar hunting for half of the year. And a new, though not enforced, rule obliges hunters to map out their routes across the province, which is roughly the size of Iowa.\u201cIt\u2019s as if we could wake up tomorrow and it\u2019d be prohibited,\u201d said Juan Carlos Cabral, 56, the long scratches on his nose attesting to a lifetime tramping through the scrubland.Mr. Cabral was helping to haul boar carcasses off the trucks near the sports club and through a parting crowd, including many women and children. Later, as some 300 hunters enjoyed a lunch of barbecued ribs and listened to live folk music, the tusks of their prey were measured to determine the winner of the main prize.As \u00c1ngel Rafael Aino, 31, a member of the winning team, straddled a dead boar and with a proud smile repeated the stabbing motion with which he had punctured its heart, some wondered how long such rituals would last.Still, observers say, hunting is too profitable an industry for the provincial authorities to ban it outright, with game reserves attracting a steady flow of tourists paying to hunt boars and red deer. The provincial government\u2019s hunting office highlighted in an email the direct and indirect revenues from all types of hunting. \u201cWe would never seek prohibition,\u201d it said.Nevertheless, fears persist and rifts are deepening among the hunters.The hunters outside the sports club, who are opposed to reserves, said they hoped future generations of hunters would be allowed to roam the flatlands despite the onslaught from critics.\u201cSharing this with my boy is the greatest thing,\u201d said Mr. Briguez, standing next to his son, Franco, 17, an aspiring veterinarian, and his hounds on a windswept plain. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of life.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And a lot should never have made the team.Like Helen Mirren with an iPhone, Acosta tracked down leads, chased dead ends and live-streamed a suspenseful tale that ranks among The Times\u2019s more successful videos in the emerging genre of \u201cLive.\u201d Reporters are always solving mysteries, but what made this unique is that Acosta did so both with her audience watching and with some offering up real-time clues.These videos represent a potentially transformational form of journalism because they let stories unfold organically, live, and with the audience able to change the experience. What is also new is that this experiment is the first where The Times is producing exclusive work for someone else\u2019s platform, in this case Facebook\u2019s. Which means that virtually none of the hundreds of videos that The Times has produced can be found on its own website.Why would the editors make such a deal? For the same reason other media companies have. Not because they revere Facebook, but because they yearn to reach its 1.7 billion users. Think of it like the annoying kid in high school who somehow gets invited to all the good parties; you hang out with him because he opens doors, not because he\u2019s your best friend. This is the same, only with higher stakes.For The Times the goal is twofold, says Louise Story, an investigative reporter who oversees the Live team. \u201cOne is to develop video that appeals to a Facebook audience, about two-thirds of which is under 34,\u201d she says. \u201cSecond is to help people around the newsroom think more about audience.\u201dUltimately, there is surely a hope that this could turn the valve on a new advertising stream.That all sounds good. But here\u2019s the problem. After watching countless hours of live video in the past few weeks, I have hit upon many that are either plagued by technical malfunctions, feel contrived, drone on too long, ignore audience questions or are simply boring, by I imagine most anyone\u2019s standards.When Times live videos are good \u2014 and many are \u2014 they capture an immediate experience, feel spontaneous and put the viewer in a front-row seat with a hand on the controls.This is a puzzling predicament for The Times. On the one hand, it has before it a compelling new form of journalism, a young and eager audience, and the crown prince of social media opening up its checkbook. On the other hand, if you\u2019re producing about 120 videos a month, implementing good quality control can take a back seat. Changing that might mean instituting clear rules of the road, like: no tedious interviews between two talking heads; no greenlighting weak ideas; and absolutely no videos that essentially fabricate scenes for the camera.The Times\u2019s top editor, Dean Baquet, believes mistakes are the price of innovation. \u201cHave we done some stuff that\u2019s not so pretty? Yes,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the newsroom needs to get comfortable using their imaginative brains to tell stories in different ways.\u201dI need no convincing that live, interactive video is a medium worth embracing. If you\u2019re not experimenting in the digital age, you won\u2019t survive. But this particular experiment veers significantly from The Times\u2019s past approach to new journalism forms. The newsroom has shown that innovation doesn\u2019t have to equate with poor quality. Whether it was with interactive graphics, virtual reality or podcasts, The Times is a model for innovating at a thoughtful, measured pace, but with quality worthy of its name.This time, that\u2019s not the case. It\u2019s as if we passed over beta and went straight to bulk. What I hope is that The Times pauses to regroup, returning with a rigor that more sharply defines the exceptional and rejects the second-rate. After all, the world has a glut of bad video and not enough of the kind The Times is capable of producing.Evan Gershkovich contributed research for this column.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With a Very Public Alarm, the Strawberry-Gooden Story Continues", "Date": "2016-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn BaseballThe question unsettled Strawberry, who, like Gooden, is a recovering addict. They were teammates on the Mets in the 1980s but were never really close friends. The station invited them to speak in part because of their parallel lives, which were explored last month in an ESPN documentary, \u201cDoc & Darryl.\u201dStrawberry seemed to be weighing an answer that would turn a private medical matter into a public cause.He hesitated before answering, he said in an interview Wednesday, because he knew Gooden was in trouble. He was also reflecting on his wife, Tracy, and others \u201cpulling me out of dope houses.\u201d He told the audience: \u201cMy fear is that \u2014 and I know addiction \u2014 and my fear is that people who don\u2019t change, they die. They die this way. I just hope the light comes on soon before it\u2019s too late.\u201dSince then, in comments made largely to The Daily News and the SNY network, Strawberry has escalated his concern into an uncomfortable public intervention designed to persuade Gooden to seek help.On Monday, he told SNY: \u201cIf no one speaks about it, he will be a tragedy; he will be an ESPN headline; he will be like Prince or Michael Jordan or Whitney Houston\u201d \u2014 clearly intending to say \u201cMichael Jackson.\u201d Joining Strawberry in the campaign has been Janice Roots, identified by The Daily News as a former live-in girlfriend of Gooden\u2019s, who said he had turned into a \u201ccocaine monster.\u201dThe spectacle has yielded one heartbreaking Daily News front-page headline, \u201cFears for Doc\u2019s Life,\u201d after another, \u201cAt Death\u2019s Door Step\u201d (which was accompanied by a photograph of a rail-thin Gooden outside his apartment in Jersey City). Gooden has denied having relapsed and has questioned Strawberry\u2019s exhorting him publicly to seek help. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s no friendship,\u201d Gooden told The Daily News, and \u201cbad judgment on my part thinking it was.\u201dHe tried to dispel concerns about his health Monday on Joe Piscopo\u2019s radio show. \u201cI am healthy,\u201d he said. \u201cI am an addict, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m an active addict.\u201d On Tuesday, before a Steiner Sports event, Gooden said on Facebook that he had been dealing with depression caused by his mother\u2019s illness and recent death.The melodrama might be compelling to fans of both men, but Strawberry\u2019s decision to go public about Gooden was wrong, said Dr. Harry Haroutunian, physician director at the Betty Ford Center. Strawberry\u2019s campaign is a rebuke of the privacy promised in Alcoholics Anonymous and suggests that \u201csomeone get up and grab on to the pillory and confess to the world that they\u2019ve relapsed,\u201d Haroutunian said in an interview Tuesday.\u201cThey\u2019re doing this in public?\u201d he said. \u201cWow. It just makes no sense to me. This is a disease with enough shame surrounding it.\u201d Told that Strawberry is a minister and had co-founded two substance abuse recovery centers in Florida, he said: \u201cOh, dear. There but for the grace of God go I. Part of the 12-step process is making amends and changing your life, but you do that by setting a good example, not proselytizing.\u201dHaroutunian added: \u201cI can\u2019t speak to his motivation for asking Gooden to do this, but Strawberry was a hard case. He was really sick, and maybe he is a miracle in his own right. But flogging someone in the town square \u2014 which may not be his intent \u2014 has never been a process that I\u2019ve seen a great deal of merit in. People need to be loved and supported and nursed back to health.\u201dBut Strawberry said he felt that Gooden would go to rehabilitation if more people knew he had relapsed.\u201cThe problem with staying private is that people die,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one wants to say anything when they see a loved one in the midst of addiction. It\u2019s not embarrassing to expose the disease of addiction. We\u2019re exposing the disease, not Dwight Gooden. If people pleading for him to get help will resonate with him, fine.\u201dGooden and Strawberry appeared to have found common ground in \u201cDoc & Darryl,\u201d which recalled how the careers of two sensational young Mets who played on the World Series team of 1986 were derailed by substance abuse. They willingly discussed their addictions, but Strawberry appeared to be healthier and more comfortable in his recovery.The documentary handled Gooden with great delicacy, never saying he might have had a relapse, but his nervous demeanor and thin physique suggested that he might have been in trouble during the filming last year.Michael Bonfiglio, one of the directors, said in a telephone interview from West Virginia on Tuesday that Gooden had displayed no addictive behavior and had been on time for all the interviews. But, he added, he was aware once production began that Strawberry and others had been privately urging Gooden to get help.\u201cIf you look at Darryl\u2019s original comments, they didn\u2019t strike me as making a planned decision to do this but was a spur-of-the-moment thing,\u201d Bonfiglio said.\u201cMy gut would be that the reason Darryl went public was out of frustration. Whether it was a miscalculation or not, it hasn\u2019t had the result that Darryl and many people want. But I think the intention behind it was to change the way many have enabled a situation that Darryl feels should not have been enabled.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misspelled the given name of the former Met shown with Dwight Gooden. He is Darryl Strawberry, not Daryl.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Tower Climber Now Faces Charges", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a city full of marquee buildings and landmarks under constant watch, it is just one among many. But as the primary residence of the Republican nominee in the midst of a heated presidential campaign, Trump Tower holds a particularly high-profile perch.The police said they received a 911 call about the climb shortly after it began around 3:30 p.m. When they came upon Mr. Rogata, he was already five stories up, using power-grip suction cups and what appeared to be a harness to aid his ascent.On Thursday, Mr. Rogata was still at Bellevue Hospital Center, where he was taken for an evaluation after he was detained, the police said.At Trump Tower that day, four police officers, including two from a counterterrorism unit, surveyed the premises. Two private security guards stood in the lobby as tourists flowed in and out. At least seven cameras dotted the lobby and the building\u2019s exterior, in addition to those on nearby buildings and traffic lights along Fifth Avenue.A spokesman for the New York Police Department said Trump Tower had at least one police officer posted there every day, an assignment created as the election cycle has picked up during the last year. The Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment.But in a social-media-saturated world, the stunts and the outrageous images they often generate have the potential to grab attention more quickly than ever. One video stream of the Trump Tower climb, posted on Facebook, drew about 5.8 million views, with a majority of those from people tuning in while the climb was in progress.\u201cIt\u2019s so much easier to get your message out and do it live,\u201d said Glenn Corbett, a professor of security, fire and emergency management at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. \u201cBack then all you got was the nightly news.\u201dThe developer Douglas Durst spoke about the two climbers who scaled The New York Times Building on the same day in 2008. He said he had taken steps at two of his buildings \u2014 Via 57, a 32-story residential building on the West Side of Manhattan, as well as 1 World Trade Center \u2014 to discourage climbers. At Via, on 57th Street near the West Side Highway, an overhang was designed for the base of the building instead of the angular walls reaching down to the sidewalk that were initially planned.\u201cWe\u2019re now very aware of having to design buildings so they are not scalable,\u201d Mr. Durst said.Security experts described the challenge of securing large buildings as a constant push, one that involved sufficient staffing in addition to shrewd design.\u201cThere\u2019s always going to be people who are going to try to steal and commit assault, and climb buildings,\u201d said Mark Lerner, the president of Epic Security Corporation, which provides security for more than 100 buildings in New York City. \u201cYou need the proper security and personnel to act as a deterrent.\u201dThe police said Mr. Rogata told them the brazen stunt had a simple purpose: He wanted to meet Mr. Trump, a motivation that he laid out in a YouTube video that was posted before the climb. A spokeswoman for the police said they believed he had \u201csome type of mental disorder.\u201dTourists strolled by the tower on Thursday, with some stopping to snap selfies in front of it.Richard Monacchio, 50, who was in town with his 14-year-old son to see a Broadway show, said he decided to visit the tower after watching the video stream.\u201cI\u2019m surprised security didn\u2019t start running out immediately,\u201d Mr. Monacchio said of the stunt. Still, he added about Mr. Rogata,\u201cI was hoping he would make it.\u201dCharles V. Bagli and Samantha Schmidt contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But Ms. Dombek isn\u2019t just a Cassandra. She\u2019s also here to help, with nearly 140 pages of sharply argued, knottily intelligent, darkly funny cultural criticism and, if that doesn\u2019t work, the blunter instrument of a nine-point diagnostic test.Do you worry you are surrounded by fake, empty people who are trying to manipulate you? Do you believe you should associate only with others with \u201chigh empathy scores\u201d? Do you require \u201cexcessive reassurance\u201d that other people, especially when encountered online, are real?If so, you may have narciphobia.In \u201cThe Selfishness of Others,\u201d her first book, she stretches out, showing how a specialized clinical term metastasized into a sweeping description of our entire culture, and a weapon of intergenerational and romantic warfare.Ms. Dombek doesn\u2019t deny that pathological narcissism is real, and can be dangerous. But expanding the diagnosis from mass killers who \u201cpost on Facebook before they walk into schools and movie theaters with guns\u201d to run-of-the-mill \u201cbad boyfriends\u201d and young people in general, she argues, blinds us to how our own craving for esteem and attention works.\u201cThis story about how some people are,\u201d she writes, \u201cunder the surface is also a story about the way that we all want.\u201dAny book, for its writer, \u201cis its own asylum,\u201d Ms. Dombek laments, \u201cbut a book about narcissism is like the padded cell inside the asylum.\u201d Here, she bangs her head against psychoanalytic theory, reality television, Greek mythology, online self-help culture and social psychology survey methodology, among other subjects, until the reader sees often-illuminating stars.One of the book\u2019s most entertaining sections riffs on the dark continent of online self-help that Ms. Dombek calls \u201cthe narcisphere,\u201d where victims of relationships with narcissists help one another parse \u201cnarc\u201d behaviors like \u201clove bombing,\u201d \u201cmirroring\u201d and \u201cdoing a discard,\u201d which sometimes come disguised as perfectly normal actions. (\u201cMy narc in-law removed the family pictures from the hallway, and replaced a living room chair with a piano,\u201d one poster says. \u201cI just can\u2019t figure out why she would do this.\u201d)She also checks in on the \u201cmanosphere,\u201d as she calls the parallel universe of sites where \u201cseduction strategies meet paleo diets,\u201d and men trade advice on how to outmaneuver the kind of needy, manipulative women who are likely to label them narcissists. But it doesn\u2019t, by her lights, stand a chance.\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing a girl with a bad boyfriend has,\u201d she writes, \u201cit\u2019s the moral upper hand in the religion of mental health.\u201dCalling out narcissism, she notes, wasn\u2019t always primarily a female sport. For Sigmund Freud, the archetypal narcissist was a woman, particularly a beautiful woman, locked in immature \u201cself-contentment and inaccessibility.\u201d Other psychologists extended his theories, giving rise to the common notion of the narcissist as wearing \u201ca charming mask covering a cold calculator, a self empty of empathy and the capacity to love.\u201dToday, pop psychology has given us a wealth of subtypes, including the Phallic Narcissist, the Corporate Narcissist, the Organizational Narcissist, the Medical Narcissist, and the Spiritual Narcissist. (Do you try to act generously, publicly align yourself with noble causes and \u201ctalk a lot about care and empathy\u201d? You may be a Communal Narcissist.)\u201cOnly one person can be the center of another person\u2019s world at any given time, and ideally, this would always be you,\u201d Ms. Dombek writes, before slipping in the shiv: \u201cThis is where all the narcissistic romance websites invite you to be: in the center of the world, stuck in time, assessing the moral status of others, until love is gone.\u201dThat may sound awfully judgmental. But Ms. Dombek, despite her efforts to keep the first-person pronoun at bay (\u201cI don\u2019t want you to find me self-absorbed,\u201d she writes early on), is also offering an earnest recovery narrative of sorts.Before the book ends, her bad-ish boyfriend \u2014 or \u201cromantic affiliate,\u201d as he prefers it \u2014 has morphed into a good boyfriend, or at least a partner no more self-preoccupied, she realizes, than she is. She breaks free not from him, but from the compulsion to obsess over whether he is a narcissist, clearing space to consider bigger questions, like the relationship between the cigarette butt she unthinkingly \u2014 a passing stranger might say narcissistically \u2014 flicks onto the sidewalk and impending climate catastrophe.A stretch? Perhaps. But it\u2019s worth pausing over one slyly double-edged item on Ms. Dombek\u2019s narciphobia checklist. Are you \u201cpreoccupied with fantasies that the world is ending because of the selfishness of others\u201d? Maybe we all are. And maybe sometimes the fantasy is real.The Selfishness of OthersAn Essay on the Fear of NarcissismBy Kristin Dombek150 pages. Farrar, Straus and Giroux. $13.00. Advertisement"}

I\u2019ve heard some observers say that getting out of China will improve Uber\u2019s bottom line, and thus speed up its path to an initial public stock offering. Do you think we\u2019ll see an Uber I.P.O. in 2017?When you eliminate something they\u2019ve poured hundreds of millions of dollars into, it makes it far easier to gain public market confidence when you make your shares available for sale.Also, um, early Uber investors and employees want a return on the billions of dollars of stock they\u2019re sitting on but can do little with until the company goes public. Travis will have to stop ignoring that at some point.So in short, yes \u2014 2017 I.P.O. is my guess.The new Instagram feature is called Stories; it\u2019s a copy of a Snapchat feature also called Stories. In each one, you snap a photo or video to add to a diarylike video of things that happened in your day. Each montage lasts only 24 hours before it disappears, which adds a kind of tossed-off, casual sensibility to your social profile.\u201cWhen She Looked Under Her Couch Cushions and Saw THIS.\u2026 I Was SHOCKED!\u201dor\u201cHe Put Garlic in His Shoes Before Going to Bed and What Happens Next Is Hard to Believe.\u201dI have to say, I really want to know what happened with the garlic shoes thing. Anyway, there are lots of news sites online that thrive on this kind of deceptive headline, so I\u2019m glad that Facebook is pushing against these. In fact, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going far enough, as I\u2019ll explain below \u2014 but first, do you have any thoughts on this?I think Facebook is up against a different problem now. This system apparently doesn\u2019t work for videos that are uploaded directly to Facebook, which is pretty much how every new media organization is posting videos these days. BuzzFeed is basically a video site, as are Mashable and a few others. I figure enterprising publications will find a way to game the system that way, eventually, though I\u2019m not sure how.This probably also won\u2019t assuage fears that Facebook is essentially an editorial organization, making editorial decisions about what should and should not be seen by the masses. They don\u2019t really deny this positioning per se \u2014 they published a list of values a few months ago on the matter \u2014 but they also probably don\u2019t want to be seen as competing with some of their biggest partners. Also, Facebook most likely doesn\u2019t see itself through this lens, but it usually never sees itself the way the outside world perceives it.But I don\u2019t think addressing clickbait headlines is enough. In general, headlines, which are really an artifact of the print newspaper, have not evolved enough for online news. In print newspapers, headlines generally appeared on the same page as the story, and there were lots of other clues \u2014 photos, captions, pull-quotes, subheads \u2014 that informed the rushed reader.Online, headlines are usually first encountered on social streams like Facebook\u2019s news feed, and the rest of the article is available only after you click. This means they function more as marketing tools than as information. News companies want you to click on them and read the whole story, so the headlines try to be pithy and clever and not give everything away.As a one-off, that\u2019s not so bad. But if your daily stream presents you with hundreds of headlines that don\u2019t tell you much, and if you\u2019re only clicking on a handful (because you\u2019re busy), you\u2019re not really getting the day\u2019s news.That\u2019s why I think headlines for online news should become longer and more informative \u2014 they should be more like ministories than like a tagline for a movie. For a good example of this, look at the news module on the right side of The New York Times\u2019s home page, which gives you a little summary of a story rather than a snappy headline.Sure, this might make news more boring. But it would have the collective effect of making it much more informative, which is a good thing.Anyway, I theoretically agree with you, but I also have to get old on you for a second. Part of the beauty of headlines is in the art of a perfectly crafted one: pithy, clever, striking. Perfect for the tone of the article with just enough sass or information to entice you further. It\u2019s a practice Times copy editors have mastered in many ways.Does artfulness work in an age of search engine optimization and clickbait-killing algorithms? Probably not. But if we do usher in a wave of so-called more informative headlines as you propose, I\u2019ll be sad to see the old ones go.Or in Timesian convention: \u201cIn Era of New Headlines, a Times Writer Feels Bummed.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The area has become a local nexus in a national heroin and opioid epidemic.But some of Mr. Cramsey\u2019s actions have raised concerns.Just weeks after his 20-year-old daughter died from an overdose, Mr. Cramsey stood before a gathering at a drug awareness program in Allentown, Pa., talking about Alexandria, his \u201cbaby girl,\u201d and telling the group that even the addicts among them were like family to him.Mr. Cramsey also spoke with a rougher edge, telling the group that he owned a shirt that read, \u201cShoot Your Local Heroin Dealer.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m wearing it right now,\u201d he said.He said Alexandria\u2019s death, from an overdose of heroin and fentanyl, had pushed him to try to help other drug users instead of seeking vengeance. \u201cI\u2019m the inoculation to this disease,\u201d Mr. Cramsey said. \u201cMy voice is going to be heard all around the country.\u201dThe Lehigh County district attorney, James B. Martin, said he was so troubled after hearing Mr. Cramsey speak at another meeting that he sent a detective to talk to him.\u201cHe made some comments that indicated to law enforcement that he wanted to take things into his own hands; we reacted to it,\u201d Mr. Martin said. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with the approach he\u2019s taken. I can\u2019t condone vigilantism.\u201dMr. Cramsey disputed that characterization. \u201cI\u2019m not a vigilante,\u201d he said during a series of telephone interviews from the correctional center. \u201cI\u2019m a father who cares enough to try and bring other kids home.\u201dTo that end, Mr. Cramsey started an anti-heroin group on Facebook, called Enough Is Enough, and began getting calls from friends and relatives of drug users seeking help, he said. Mr. Cramsey said he usually began his interventions by talking about his daughter, who had worked as a model, and showing the image of her tattooed on his arm.In just a few months, he estimated, he had helped dozens of people. \u201cI have literally brought kids back from the dark side, kids that would have stayed in that darkness until they were brought out in a body bag,\u201d he said.In fact, J. Layne Turner, the drug and alcohol administrator for Lehigh County, said that he knew of three people Mr. Cramsey had delivered to treatment centers in the month and a half before he was arrested.Mr. Turner described Mr. Cramsey\u2019s involvement in terms of a recent trend, with parents going public about the destruction caused by drugs, pushing back against the stigma associated with addiction. \u201cParents have felt such shame,\u201d he said.Andrew Miller, 28, who has struggled with addiction, said he could not find a treatment center that was willing to accept him without health insurance.Within an hour of meeting Mr. Cramsey, Mr. Miller said, he had been checked into a rehabilitation center.\u201cThere\u2019s nobody I\u2019ve met that cares as much as him,\u201d Mr. Miller said. Though Mr. Miller relapsed this summer, he is now in a sober living center, his mother, Cyndi, said in a recent interview. Cyndi requested that her last name not be used to protect her privacy.Jennifer Dotel, of Northampton, Pa., said that after she contacted Mr. Cramsey on Facebook, he rushed to her house to speak with her 25-year-old son, Nicholas Quinn.She said she had struggled to get her son into treatment and welcomed the speed with which Mr. Cramsey came to her aid. Ms. Dotel, who is raising Mr. Quinn\u2019s toddler son, said that after Mr. Cramsey\u2019s visit her son was honest about his problem for the first time. Mr. Cramsey, she said, has helped bring heroin awareness to the forefront. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of,\u201d Ms. Dotel said. Her son is still struggling to get his life on track, she said.In Lehigh County, overdose deaths rose so sharply in 2015 \u2014 to a record 115 \u2014 that the coroner, Scott Grim, had to ask for additional funding to perform autopsies. With 95 overdose deaths so far in 2016, the county was expected to exceed 140 for the year. \u201cThat\u2019s an extremely disturbing number,\u201d Mr. Grim said.Mr. Cramsey, Mr. Smith and Ms. Arendt remain in jail. If they are convicted of the felony weapons charges, each could face about 10 years in prison, a spokesman for the Hudson County prosecutor\u2019s office said.

{"Headline": "When the Pilot Is a Mom: Accommodating New Motherhood at 30,000 Feet", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "Supported byBoarding a flight can feel like stepping into a time capsule \u2014 men typically fly the plane, while most flight attendants are still women. Which is why a female pilot from Delta Air Lines did something dramatic at a union meeting recently.Standing before her male colleagues, the captain unbuttoned her uniform, strapped a breast pump over the white undershirt she wore underneath, and began to demonstrate the apparatus. As the machine made its typical \u201cchug, chug, chug\u201d noise, attendees squirmed in their seats, looked at their feet and shuffled papers.It was the latest episode in what has proved to be a difficult workplace issue to solve: how to accommodate commercial airline pilots who are balancing new motherhood.While their proposals differ, all say they aim for one thing: to avoid situations in which pilots have been leaving the cockpit in midflight for as long as 20 minutes, the amount of time often required to pump breast milk.\u201cThe airlines have maternity policies that are archaic,\u201d said Kathy McCullough, 61, a retired captain for Northwest Airlines, which merged with Delta in 2008, who has advocated on behalf of the pilots to Delta management. \u201cI am so glad that they\u2019re stepping forward and taking a stand.\u201dMore than 40 years later, the major carriers still haven\u2019t resolved this issue. They set their policies for pilots based on the collective bargaining agreements negotiated by the unions. But women of childbearing age account for just a sliver of union membership, so maternity leave and breast-feeding policies have not been at the top of union agendas.Plus, some members oppose the proposals, citing the costs. One local union leader told several women in an email: \u201cHaving a child is a personal choice and asking the rest of us to fund your choice will be a difficult sell to the pilot group.\u201d The leader declined to be interviewed for this article; the union said he was not an authorized spokesman.Delta\u2019s female pilots still hope to win over a majority of their colleagues. They argue that without paid leave, they\u2019re faced with a choice to either stay home to breast-feed their babies or earn income for their families.Female pilots can begin to lose wages months before a baby is born. Most contracts at major airlines force pregnant pilots to stop flying eight to 14 weeks before a baby\u2019s due date.After the push by Delta\u2019s pilots this summer, the airline changed its policy this month. Delta now allows them to fly, with their doctor\u2019s approval, until the end of pregnancy if they so choose.Morgan Durrant, a spokesman for Delta, pointed out that once they stop flying, women can use accrued sick days or apply for disability benefits to partially cover their lost wages. Otherwise, the leave is unpaid.Once a baby is born, the major airlines typically don\u2019t offer paid maternity leave or alternative ground assignments for breast-feeding mothers. Some carriers, including United Airlines and Alaska Airlines, do offer female pilots up to one year of unpaid leave. Until recently, Delta did not offer such a policy, but the airline has added one year of unpaid leave to the pilot contract.Next a flight attendant \u2014 to prevent passengers from approaching the lavatory \u2014 would barricade the aisle with a beverage cart. Then the attendant would join the captain in the cockpit, in keeping with rules that require at least two people in an airline cockpit at all times.Only then could Ms. Beck slip into the lavatory for a 20-minute pumping session.\u201cIt\u2019s by far not my favorite place to make my child\u2019s next meal,\u201d Ms. Beck said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a sacrifice I knew I would have to accept because I came back to work.\u201dMs. Beck said that after nearly 20 years in the aviation industry, she assumed she could keep her job and nurse her baby. \u201cI guess it never came to light in my mind that I couldn\u2019t do both,\u201d she said.Frontier\u2019s management has argued that extended breaks from the cockpit raise safety issues. The company has not offered an in-flight alternative for breast pumping, however, or made available temporary jobs on the ground.\u201cWhile there are many workplaces that might allow for nursing mothers to express breast milk during a break from work activities, the duties of a commercial airline pilot present unique circumstances,\u201d a Frontier spokesman, Jim Faulkner, said in a statement.The Federal Aviation Administration has issued no official rules for pilots who pump in-flight. But Alison Duquette, a spokeswoman for the agency, said that \u201cleaving the flight deck for 20 minutes would not be acceptable\u201d under most circumstances.A lactating mother often needs to pump breast milk every three to four hours. When she cannot do so, painful pressure can build up in her chest, accompanied by a risk of infection.\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly distracting and painful,\u201d said Ms. Beck, \u201clike when you need to go to the bathroom and can\u2019t.\u201dIn a few instances at Delta, according to several of the airline\u2019s women pilots, their colleagues had to pump breast milk in the cockpit. The pumps need electricity, and in some older planes, the only plugs available are on the flight deck.The Delta female pilots are seeking a leave policy that would let mothers stay home for six months with pay to breast-feed newborns, and up to two years of unpaid leave.Pilots can earn a base salary of $200,000 and more in later years. But young pilots often start at low wages as flight instructors, crop dusters, or flying charter or tourism flights, and don\u2019t reach the major carriers until their early 30s, a time when they may be planning families. As a result, one Delta pilot said, it is not uncommon for several women in a class of new pilots to be pregnant after a standard yearlong period of probation flying.Ten female Delta pilots agreed to speak to The New York Times on the condition of anonymity, for fear of alienating their employer or the male union members they hope will take up their cause.The union, through a spokeswoman, Kelly Regus, declined to comment on \u201cthe substance of internal union discussions.\u201d Mr. Durrant, the Delta spokesman, noted that the airline had updated some of its policies, and he said it would continue to examine its maternity and paternity leave programs.\u201cBalancing the demands of a career and raising a family present challenges for all working parents, but we recognize there are unique challenges presented for our female pilots as their children are born,\u201d Mr. Durrant said in an emailed statement.It has been difficult for the women to compare notes about workplace issues. There are so few of them, they rarely see or fly with one another. That changed with a private Facebook group known as FAST \u2014 Female Aviators Sticking Together \u2014 that has grown quickly over the past year. It now has nearly 6,000 members.There are also spinoffs like DAMP, or Delta Air Lines Mommy Pilots. The woman who delivered the breast pump demonstration in June did so on behalf of about 100 pilots in that Facebook group.And the Delta and Frontier pilots know they are pressing an issue that still plagues a group long dominated by women: flight attendants.This year, a flight attendant for Endeavor Air, a regional airline owned by Delta, filed a discrimination complaint with the New York City Commission on Human Rights, claiming the airline failed to provide reasonable breaks or private places to pump breast milk in her workplace. The commission is investigating.Mr. Durrant, the Delta spokesman, said Endeavor had worked to accommodate the employee and \u201chas gone to great lengths to provide reasonable accommodations for breast-feeding employees.\u201dJoanna L. Grossman, an expert on labor law and gender issues, said the pilots are fighting a complex battle.\u201cThis is part of breaking down the cockpit door \u2014 that\u2019s the glass ceiling here,\u201d said Ms. Grossman, a professor at the Dedman School of Law at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. \u201cHow do you make a job work when it was designed without you in mind?\u201dAdvertisement"}

Marinate on this lower level of game play, and Pok\u00e9mon Go feels less like a competition and more like a charming little interlude.In this way, Pok\u00e9mon Go has become the rare app to unite the two extremes of the mobile gaming universe. One, the compulsive, rank-obsessed land of Candy Crush and Clash of Clans. The other, its antidote \u2014 the serene, score-free world of so-called slow games.Slow games are less ubiquitous and straightforwardly tantalizing than traditional mobile games. They often seem to lack any point at all. Instead, they invite players to engage in simpler virtual pleasures \u2014 taking a stroll, watering plants, feeding stray cats.Neko Atsume is my coping mechanism of choice.

A Blue-Collar Town Debates His Credentials", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "The talk gets heated in Youngstown, Ohio, when residents discuss whether a New York billionaire\u2019s ideas can revitalize a struggling Rust Belt town.Supported byYOUNGSTOWN, Ohio \u2014 \u201cIs this idiot for Trump?\u201d Mark Wasko asked, his voice booming across the parking lot of an out-of-business supermarket.It was a late weekday morning in a troubled, shrinking Rust Belt city that is fed up with being known as a troubled, shrinking Rust Belt city. The man Mr. Wasko was calling an idiot \u2014 perhaps seriously, or playfully, or both \u2014 was his friend Vincent Archangelo Strines.Mr. Wasko, 48, had seen Mr. Strines, 55, a beefy blond man with a pack of cigarillos in his breast pocket, sitting behind a folding table and selling raffle tickets to support his nonprofit addiction recovery organization. So Mr. Wasko had parked his big soda truck in the lot and hopped out. He was appalled to learn that his friend, normally a Democratic voter, was now supporting Donald J. Trump.He looked Mr. Strines in the eye. \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot,\u201d he declared.Youngstown is the kind of blue-collar Midwestern stronghold where Mr. Trump\u2019s struggling campaign must make a strong showing, particularly among white voters, if he is to have any chance of winning the presidential election. Broaching the topic of Mr. Trump on a street corner or bar stool here \u2014 and thus delving into matters of race, economics, immigration and the still-painful matter of the city\u2019s disintegration \u2014 can be a volatile business.\u201cIf you want to punch me in the face, do it,\u201d Mr. Strines dared Mr. Wasko casually, after about 15 minutes of debate that played out under a billboard for a nearby adult novelty store called Sassy Sensations and touched on all of those issues.Cars whooshed up and down Mahoning Avenue, past businesses shuttered or struggling, and past tired residential side streets now considered \u201cfood deserts\u201d since the grocery store, a Sparkle Market, closed down about four years ago. Youngstown, a city of about 65,000 people, is about 60 percent smaller than it was in 1960. Decades ago, blacks, Irish, Italians and Eastern Europeans came to work among the great blast furnaces of the old mills. When those businesses closed between 1977 and 1982, tens of thousands lost their jobs.Today there are still some metal industry and manufacturing jobs. There is a big General Motors plant north of town that produces the small Chevrolet Cruze sedan. There is a maximum-security prison that opened in 1998. There is a business incubator, focused on reimagining Youngstown as a hub for software and 3-D printing.In addition, there are signs of recovery from the Great Recession: The unemployment rate, which peaked at nearly 17 percent in January 2010, stood at 7.6 percent in June.There is also a widespread belief that Mr. Trump is right when he says that the United States must renegotiate the terms of its trade with the world.Mr. Strines said that he worked for years as a quality assurance superintendent in the aluminum business, making good money until health issues related to his drinking problem forced him to retire. In that time, he said, he saw many businesses go under because China could produce aluminum for a fraction of what it cost American companies. He is hoping Mr. Trump will institute more protective tariffs.\u201cI think he could bring the economy back,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a take-charge kind of guy.\u201dMr. Wasko huffed. He doubted that Mr. Trump would follow through on any of his promises. What about the border wall? Mr. Trump was never going to get Mexico to pay for that, he said. And anyhow, wasn\u2019t America great already?Mr. Strines said: \u201cYou think America is great? Come look for a job in Youngstown.\u2019\u2019Wendy Aron, 58, emerged from the speech energized. She was once a supporter of President Obama but was dismayed by the weakness of the post-recession recovery. Her housecleaning business in the Youngstown suburb of Boardman has shrunk, going from a dozen employees to a two-person operation: her and her daughter. Working people, she said, don\u2019t have the money to pay for maid service anymore.Many of her close friends remain Democrats. \u201cThey just put me down,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to even talk to them.\u201dGayle Hite, an employee at a hospital, and her husband, Joseph, were not invited to the speech, but got as close to it as they could, waiting outside a campus building with her wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d T-shirt.She is a longtime Republican, but her husband, who usually votes Democrat, was planning to vote for Mr. Trump this year. They had watched Mr. Trump slog through a tough couple of weeks, taking criticism for, among other things, his feud with the family of a slain Muslim American soldier. But what some saw as gaffes were, to Mr. Hite, proof that Mr. Trump was a true change agent.\u201cHe\u2019s not bought or sold by anybody,\u201d said Mr. Hite, a retired corrections officer. \u201cHe can say what he wants.\u201dThese days Mr. Hite, 64, receives a Social Security check, but he said he worried about the ways in which a volatile world might bankrupt the government. What would it cost to absorb Syrian refugees? And the immigrants coming across the Mexican border?\u201cIt shows we\u2019re not really running our country,\u201d Ms. Hite said. \u201cSometimes I don\u2019t believe our vote counts.\u201dIn Mr. Springsteen\u2019s song \u201cYoungstown,\u201d the narrator, a laid-off mill worker, wishes for a future not in heaven but in \u201cthe fiery furnaces of hell.\u201d The character was inspired, in part, by a real steelworker, Joe Marshall Jr., whom Mr. Springsteen had read about in a book.Today Mr. Marshall, a small, sturdy man, who turns 63 on Saturday, can be found in Columbus, living in a $500 apartment and drawing a full state pension. After the steel industry fell apart, he pursued a life in law enforcement. He is an ardent Trump supporter.\u201cHe says what the average person is afraid to say because it\u2019s politically incorrect,\u201d Mr. Marshall said about Mr. Trump.Mr. Marshall worked at the Mahoning County Sheriff\u2019s Office for 23 years, at the jail and on patrol \u2014 a front-row seat, he said, to the city\u2019s dramatic decline. He watched as the professional classes emptied out, and as the city\u2019s complexion changed: Youngstown, 74 percent white in 1970, is now about evenly divided between blacks and whites.Drugs came in, he said. The murder rate soared. Young people were dropping out of school at 15 years of age, Mr. Marshall said, because they didn\u2019t see what kinds of work a degree would get them.\u201cWhere are they going to go, Taco Bell?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat\u2019s minimum-wage jobs.\u201dSeven years ago, he moved away, taking a job as a corrections officer. Today, his political views are eclectic. The Democrats, he said, \u201cfailed Youngstown\u201d: During the steel days, they were the party of overbearing regulations, the ones who told management that they couldn\u2019t open a second blast furnace. \u201cThat\u2019s jobs they took away,\u201d he said.On Facebook, Mr. Marshall\u2019s posts extol the beauty of mixed-race families, and the contributions of African-Americans to the country\u2019s culture. But he is wary of the big mosque in his neighborhood and suspects Muslims there of planning an attack. The Democrats, he said, seem indifferent to whites.\u201cBelieve me, as Jesus Christ is my lord and savior, I\u2019m not prejudiced or anything,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it seems if you\u2019re a minority, they help you out a lot more than if you\u2019re white.\u201d\u201cHe was a good guy,\u201d Mr. Marshall said of Mr. Traficant, who had hired him personally. \u201cI remember he told me, \u2018You screw up, Marshall, I\u2019ll kill you.\u2019\u201dLike Mr. Trump, Mr. Traficant, who went by the nickname Jimbo, annoyed and defied members of both parties, dished out scathing personal insults, blasted Washington insiders and purported to speak for the average Joe. He proposed sending troops to secure the Mexican border and criticized free trade. He even sported a flamboyant and gravity-defying hairdo, though it proved to be a toupee.Back in Youngstown, the fondness for Mr. Traficant lingers despite allegations that he was tied to the mob.\u201cWell, the whole city was like that,\u201d said Kathy Miller, the Trump campaign coordinator for Mahoning County. She said it was difficult to agree with everything Mr. Traficant did, just as it is with Mr. Trump. But she said that Mr. Traficant\u2019s constituent services were unparalleled.\u201cJimbo got it taken care of,\u201d she said.Out in the parking lot, Mr. Strines seconded the praise. \u201cHe just told it the way it was, and I think Trump is the same type of guy as Traficant,\u201d he said.Mr. Strines even asserted that Youngstown had been a better, safer place when the mob was in control. So it would be, he said, in Mr. Trump\u2019s America.Once upon a time, he said, everybody in Youngstown knew that if someone messed up and failed to follow certain rules, \u201cthat\u2019s where the mob would step in.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s where Trump would step in,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce somebody\u2019s got fear, like Iraq will have, like China will have,\u201d he said, the world will grow calmer. \u201cAll of those illegal aliens better pack up their toothbrushes and start running.\u201dMr. Wasko wasn\u2019t buying it: \u201cSo let\u2019s instill fear in everyone in America,\u201d he said sarcastically.\u201cNo,\u201d Mr. Strines said, \u201conly the bad ones, man.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Now, his message of resilience, along with Germans\u2019 desire for a reassuring symbol, has made him Germany\u2019s most popular refugee.He sings, he plays and, sometimes, he smacks the piano in grief and rage.Mr. Ahmad is booked virtually every night, crisscrossing the country from stadiums to modest provincial bars. He has appeared in dozens of uplifting German news accounts and received a prestigious prize named for one of his idols, Beethoven. Christina Aguilera\u2019s film production company has been in touch.\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been taken out of reality,\u201d he says one day on a bullet train between venues.He grew up, he continues, hearing his father spin his life story into legend, \u201clike you tell stories about Sinbad the sailor.\u201d But even the true-life tale of a self-made, blind musician who learned to play the violin pales in comparison with his own fantastical voyage, from Syrian government siege and Islamist extremist rule through shipwreck and exile to uneasy celebrity.Onstage every night, he re-enacts that journey. And on every road trip in between, he re-examines it \u2014 rather mercilessly, like the self-doubting artist he has always been.\u201cI feel like a frog that\u2019s being dissected,\u201d he confesses, collapsing into a seat at the start of a four-train, five-hour trip to his next gig, which, as always, because of labor restrictions on refugees, he will play for free.\u201cI\u2019m selling myself,\u201d he says, \u201cand I\u2019m not even getting the money.\u201dWorse, he wonders if he is making any difference: \u201cThey clap for me, but the rest\u201d \u2014 back in Syria \u2014 \u201care still in prison, under siege, under bombs.\u201dHis own boys rebuke him: \u201cYou didn\u2019t send a plane to bring us.\u201dMr. Ahmad\u2019s life as the piano-playing refugee began three years ago when he parked his instrument on a street of destroyed buildings \u2014 walls collapsed, awnings askew \u2014 and began to sing.He lived in Yarmouk, a neighborhood on the outskirts of Damascus, the capital, that started as a refugee camp for Palestinians in the 1950s. Over the years, it grew into a bustling district of a half-million Palestinians and Syrians.But it was now gutted by the Syrian civil war. Government troops kept it cordoned off, pounding it with artillery and sometimes airstrikes. Insurgent groups vied for control. Lack of regular access to food and medicine was beginning to kill; some of the most vulnerable starved to death.His only audience was his neighbors, trapped with him. And his goal was almost painfully modest: to keep everyone from losing their minds.\u201cI want to give them a beautiful dream,\u201d he said back then, over a spotty internet link. \u201cTo change this black color at least into gray.\u201dSoon, videos of the performances spread online, first among Syrians, then more widely, a different kind of dispatch from a war so brutal that it had already left much of the world numb.Mr. Ahmad became a symbol of hope and defiance and began to embrace a larger mission: showing that there were human beings stuck in Yarmouk.\u201cEveryone is against the civilians,\u201d he said in a video chat.Eventually, his new fame would help him escape the siege \u2014 to join the emigrants he sang of. That helps drive his ambivalence and fuel a colossal case of survivor\u2019s guilt.It is also how, after years of online correspondence, my colleague Hwaida Saad and I find ourselves on the main square of Wiesbaden on a late spring afternoon, meeting Mr. Ahmad in person for the first time.It is clear how much he has already changed. He wheels his bike confidently up to the cafe, birdlike and sprightly in a striped shirt and skinny jeans, and wolfs down an \u00e9clair. He has learned some staccato English. When his phone rings, which it does constantly, he adopts the brisk, businesslike tone of a performer too busy for all of his fans.\u201cI talk to a million people on the phone,\u201d he tells a caller. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, which one is your concert?\u201dThe very first thing he tells us is that he does not want to sugarcoat the experience of exile, or to be anyone\u2019s poster child for Europe as a happy ending.\u201cThey see me as a star,\u201d he says. \u201cBut still, they look at us funny.\u201dHe says people often ask how it feels to play in Germany, and now, for once, he wants to give the honest answer: \u201cI feel nothing. I close my eyes, and all around me \u2014 I play and I remember Yarmouk.\u201dThe memory of war is everywhere in Wiesbaden. The dormitory where Mr. Ahmad shares a room with five other refugees is called the American Camp, for the troops it long housed after World War II. Every day, he wheels his bike past brass tiles bearing the names of deported Jews, embedded in sidewalks outside their onetime homes.Many of Mr. Ahmad\u2019s enthusiastic helpers here see aiding refugees as part of Germany\u2019s moral burden, atoning for its Nazi past. When the local newspaper reported that he needed someone to donate a piano, he was offered 30.Lately, she has been battling rules that have blocked Mr. Ahmad from being paid for performances, or even collecting the Beethoven prize honorarium of 10,000 euros, about $11,200. He has reached a stage in his asylum process that lets him work as, say, a wage laborer. But German rules, Ms. Gruhn says, seem not to envision a refugee artist or musician.So he subsists on the government\u2019s \u20ac300 monthly refugee stipend.But still, he keeps playing because that is not just what he does, but who he has become.That evening, as he rushes to yet another concert, he insists that he is not a great pianist, just good at marketing his story. He has invited other refugees to join him at concerts, to ease the minds of Germans who fear that every refugee might be a terrorist.\u201cPeople will see them sitting and listening to music,\u201d he explains. \u201cSweet people, following German rules.\u201dThe concert is a hit. But he cannot sleep afterward, and a day later, his mood darkens as he heads to his next show.At the train station, he learns the venue is five hours away, not two, as he was told. Too many patrons are booking too many shows, not coordinating, not considering his exhaustion. Germans, he says, would never subject themselves to such a schedule.\u201cJust say no,\u201d Ms. Gruhn has told him. But he cannot. He feels obligated. As the train zips through a storybook landscape \u2014 castle turrets, deep woods \u2014 he brings to mind an enchanted child, unable to stop dancing.Disembarking at G\u00fctersloh, an industrial town clear across the country, he sees a car hit a bicyclist, who falls with a thud.\u201cShe\u2019s going to die,\u201d he says. \u201cI know the sound. Just look at it, the blood. She will die for sure.\u201dBut there is no blood. The paramedics think the cyclist will be all right.Is Mr. Ahmad reliving Yarmouk?It was a shock to Palestinians raised on the Syrian government\u2019s claim to be their champion. For Mr. Ahmad, it was the start of \u201ca second Nakba,\u201d or disaster, the Palestinians\u2019 name for their displacement in 1948. To him, Yarmouk was a substitute homeland. But his father, born in southern Syria after his parents were driven from their home in the Galilee, had always told him different.\u201cHe told me music is our country,\u201d Mr. Ahmad tells us. \u201cAnd now I\u2019m noticing this is true.\u201dMr. Ahmad\u2019s parents, like him, were rescued by music.His father, Ibrahim, lost his sight at 8. He was sent to a school for the blind in Damascus, bound for a life of weaving wicker chairs. But he lied, telling his father that he needed a violin or he would be kicked out of school.He learned to play Arabic classics and opened a music shop in Yarmouk. Later, in the Old City of Damascus, a young Syrian woman named Iman, whose conservative father did not want her studying music, sneaked to Ibrahim\u2019s shop and asked for accordion lessons. Romance ensued, but her father rejected her blind suitor: \u201cYou want to be a servant?\u201dSo Iman, pretending her accordion needed repairs, took her mother to the shop. Ibrahim played, Iman\u2019s mother sang. A few years later, Aeham Ahmad was born.He worked hard but lacked the grades, and the connections, for a concert career, so he studied music education and worked in the shop. Still, he played with a driven energy.\u201cI always feel I\u2019m not good enough,\u201d Mr. Ahmad says. \u201cI was like this before, and the war made it worse: I play every day to fix something that is screwed up in me.\u201dOne day, Mr. Ahmad noticed a young woman in glasses lingering at the window. Mortified, he pretended to be on the phone. Later, she walked in with shawarma sandwiches.\u201cFor me and you,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to eat.\u201dIt was a bold move in their traditional neighborhood. But Mr. Ahmad liked that. He felt even luckier after war broke out. His wife gave birth twice while their town was under siege, and she supported him when playing music became risky.\u201cI thank God,\u201d he says, \u201cfor having a strong woman.\u201dWhen protests against President Bashar al-Assad of Syria began in 2011, he says, he watched with interest but did not join. He was reluctant to embrace a cause or identity beyond music, \u201cmy own personal revolution.\u201dSecurity forces fired on protesters; armed rebellion gathered steam. Yarmouk stayed neutral at first, as Palestinian leaders urged. But Syria\u2019s relatively good treatment of Palestinians gave them a stake in the country, and like Syrians, they were divided. Many joined the rebellion.Mr. Ahmad did not try to leave; he was wanted for military service. To feed the family, he spent its savings. Then an uncle set his pigeons free and fled himself, leaving the birds\u2019 feed, a mountain of lentils. Mr. Ahmad opened a falafel stand. Falafel should be made of chickpeas, but people were hungry.One day, a shell landed near his stand, killing three customers. Shrapnel hit Mr. Ahmad\u2019s hand. He started playing piano more, to rehabilitate his fingers. That gave him an idea. The lentils were running out, but music never would.He found seven friends sharing a water pipe (tobacco was scarce). One, Mahmoud Tamim, liked to write songs mocking Mr. Assad; Mr. Ahmad asked him to write one about Yarmouk. They became the first Yarmouk Guys, Shebab al-Yarmouk.For their debut, they pushed the piano to the rubble from the first airstrike and sang the new song, \u201cYarmouk Is Missing You.\u201d It remains their biggest hit.The project felt pure back then, but as their fame grew, some singers asked for pay. Next, activists started selling photographs to media outlets.Even Mr. Ahmad saw opportunities.\u201cAlways, there is the ego,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThey made money off me, but without these photos, I am not famous.\u201dThe attention made it harder to fend off warlords. A pro-Assad Palestinian faction demanded that he remove a line about Yarmouk\u2019s being \u201csurrounded by cannons,\u201d since the obvious culprit was the government.Then came hard-line Islamists. They objected first to mixed-gender concerts, later to music in general.\u201cIf the Prophet Muhammad were here, they would call him an infidel if he disagreed with them \u2014 it\u2019s about \u2018agree and obey,\u2019\u201d Mr. Ahmad complained at the time in a video chat. \u201cCan they stop the birds from singing?\u201dHe stopped playing in public. He hid his electronic keyboard in a duffel bag and climbed to rooftops to play, watching out for government snipers.Still, he felt unsafe. Members of his band were being abducted: Mr. Tamim by security forces, others by Islamist fighters. One day, a gunman set his piano on fire.Finally, Mr. Ahmad cashed in. A German journalist sent enough money to get him and his family out of Yarmouk.Halfway to Turkey, security forces stopped them and threw them in jail, the children included. They got out a week later, but, shaken, they decided that his wife and their children would wait in Syria; because relatives are still in danger, we are not disclosing their names. Mr. Ahmad went on alone.For a while, he was just another refugee. He faded into the masses fleeing then, in August 2015, as the exodus to Europe grew.Paying smugglers, he crossed mountains, dodging checkpoints and border guards.Now, he was traveling openly as the Piano Man of Yarmouk.Mr. Ahmad bounced from camp to camp, but practically everywhere, he found helpers who knew his story.German liberals spreading a message of inclusion seized on Mr. Ahmad, \u201cas if,\u201d he joked, \u201cI\u2019m the only refugee around.\u201dAudiences and journalists skewed his story to fit European fears, he says, emphasizing Islamist extremists but playing down the government siege.But he could hardly complain, counting on the attention to speed the paperwork to bring his family to Germany \u2014 and maybe even smooth others\u2019 path to integration.\u201cI failed to change anything in Syria,\u201d he reasoned, \u201cbut here I might have a chance.\u201dBy the time we visit, Mr. Ahmad is used to the contrasts of life in this wealthy German town. Outside his dormitory, spacious houses are draped with lilacs and rhododendrons, and a poster advertises a \u20ac50 reward for a lost teddy bear.Rarely alone, he is lonely. He walks head down, video chatting with his wife and boys. He bounces between his dorm room and fancy hotels paid for by concert organizers. He has met the German chancellor, Angela Merkel.Television news amps up fear of refugees and reports occasional attacks on migrants. But Mr. Ahmad insists that no German has ever threatened him.And so, he keeps playing, trying to change German minds \u2014 and fight stereotypes.A day after the Wiesbaden concert, Mr. Ahmad plays for a high school class.The students listen, rapt, then ask questions that rankle.\u201cIf you were still in Syria, would you be fighting for ISIS?\u201d\u201cHow could you learn piano in Syria?\u201dHe answers gamely: He is against all violence; Syrians are the Islamic State\u2019s main victims; prewar Syria was troubled, not destitute; his family owned several houses and pianos.\u201cHow has your integration been?\u201d someone asks.\u201cPerfect,\u201d he says.Just once we see him lose his temper: a wealthy concert host demands \u20ac2 change from a \u20ac200 train ticket. \u201cEveryone is promoting themselves,\u201d Mr. Ahmad splutters later.Still he wonders onstage: \u201cAre they feeling the music I\u2019m feeling? Or do they just feel pity because I\u2019m a refugee?\u201dGermans, he tells an audience in Wiesbaden, often ask if he has heard of Mozart. He pauses a beat, then charges into a high-speed medley: Mozart\u2019s Rondo Alla Turca intercut with Beethoven\u2019s \u201cF\u00fcr Elise.\u201dHe slows down, speeds up, flashes a grin, then swipes a hand up and down the keyboard like Little Richard, or Liberace. The crowd laughs, clapping in time. It is a musical joke, a jab at racist assumptions. And they are in on it.Reporting was contributed by Hwaida Saad from Wiesbaden, G\u00fctersloh and Karlsruhe, Germany, and Beirut, Lebanon; Mohammad Ghannam from Beirut; Maher Samaan from Paris; and Katarina Johanssen from Berlin.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Every Company Is a Tech Company, Does the Label Matter?", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "Supported byStrategiesApple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon have created something of a watershed moment in the stock market.They became the four most valuable companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index at the close of trading on Aug. 1, according to S.&P.\u2019s official tally. That meant that tech companies, by one common definition, occupied the four top spots in the market capitalization rankings, a rare and brief occurrence.\u201cIt may never have happened before at the close of trading,\u201d said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. The full history of daily rankings isn\u2019t readily available, however, so we can\u2019t be certain, and such rankings are evanescent, shifting with every tick of the stock market. In fact, on Friday, Amazon dropped back into sixth place.But no matter: The early August rankings were a reminder of how far tech has come. It is a dominant force in the stock market and the economy, one so all-encompassing that tech may no longer even be a useful concept for understanding today\u2019s stock market.One of them is Exxon Mobil, the energy giant and the most valuable company in the S.&P. as recently as 2012. But Exxon Mobil has been cut down in size by the oil price debacle. The other is Berkshire Hathaway, Warren E. Buffett\u2019s conglomerate, which the S.&P. categorizes as a financial services company \u2014 the only such company left in the Top 10 market cap list. Berkshire announced its own earnings after trading closed on Friday. We\u2019ll soon learn whether the market is pleased enough to vault Berkshire further ahead of Amazon.The three tech companies at the very top in market cap \u2014 Apple, Google and Microsoft \u2014 have held high positions for a long while. (Google, ranked second, trades as Alphabet, the name of its parent company.) Google passed Apple in value briefly this year, but Apple regained the top perch, which it has held since 2012. Microsoft, now No. 3, was the most valuable company during the last tech boom, in the early 2000s.Virtually no one disputes S.&P.\u2019s formal classification of Apple, Google and Microsoft as \u201cinformation technology\u201d companies. The same is true of Facebook, which held seventh place in the latest list of most valuable companies. But while Amazon is often described as a tech company \u2014 and undoubtedly uses and creates innovative technology \u2014 S.&P. has never classified it as one.In fact, Amazon is formally known as a \u201cconsumer discretionary company,\u201d like Walmart, which it has displaced as a member of the Top 10 most valuable companies. Amazon is the only consumer discretionary company left in the Top 10. Is it in some sense a tech company? Certainly, and we\u2019ll get back to that.But the same can be said, to one degree or another, about the three other members of the Top 10 \u2014 old companies that are still prospering in large part because of their mastery of advanced technologies. Johnson & Johnson, for example, which is ranked eighth, is a health care company, yet it is heavily involved in technology of a biological kind. Then there is General Electric, the diversified industrial company (and, until recently, also a financial services company), once described as a bellwether for the entire market. It conducts advanced research and sells tech products.Last on the list is AT&T, a telecommunications company, which, in an early form, helped create computer languages and operating systems on which modern tech companies are built. In 1957, when the S.&P. 500 was born, an ancestral version of AT&T was the most valuable company in the United States by a very wide margin, said Jeremy J. Siegel, a Wharton business school professor, the author of \u201cStocks for the Long Run\u201d and a market historian.\u201cAT&T back then was a highly regulated old phone company,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a giant, later broken up into smaller companies. And it was an outlier, because the other big companies in the S.&P. 500 in that era were mainly materials companies \u2014 like United States Steel, DuPont and Union Carbide \u2014 and an awful lot of oil companies.\u201dIn 1957, the economy ran on oil, and the biggest energy company was Standard Oil of New Jersey \u2014 an ancestor of Exxon Mobil. No pure tech company ranked in the Top 10 back then, not even IBM, which soon became the dominant tech company, a position it held until Microsoft surpassed it in the mid-1990s. That was the decade of the great tech boom, culminating in the bubble that burst in March 2000. Microsoft was No. 1 in market cap at the end of 1999, and four other tech companies \u2014 Cisco Systems, Intel, IBM and America Online \u2014 were also among the Top 10 most valuable companies. The stock market celebrated tech\u2019s ascendance then, as it does now.But this is a different era. When you dig deeper into the S.&P. 500, it\u2019s clear that while the valuations of tech companies swelled to unrealistically high proportions in those bubble years, the valuations of most companies are far more modest now. In March 2000, the height of the bubble, the value of information technology companies swelled to 34.5 percent of the total market cap of the S.&P. 500. At the moment, the comparable figure is only 20.7 percent, data from the Bespoke Investment Group shows. That\u2019s not much more than the 15.7 percent share of financial companies or the 15.2 percent share of the health care sector. By contrast, finance ballooned as high as 22.3 percent at the end of 2006, in what can be seen in hindsight as a financial bubble.On the other hand, materials and energy companies, which together constituted almost half of the total value of the S.&P. 500 in 1957, now account for less than 10 percent of it. That reflects the collapse of energy and commodity prices over the last few years, and it may well be a temporary phenomenon. In the meantime, diversified energy companies like Exxon Mobil are investing heavily in technology, a necessity if they are to flourish.It\u2019s clear even to energy companies, in other words, that tech\u2019s abiding power in the marketplace is not temporary. Technology permeates every sector of the economy, even those not formally classified as high-tech. Whether companies like Amazon and Johnson & Johnson should carry tech labels is beside the point. Tech has already taken over.These days every company is a tech company, but some have better niches, faster growth, more attractive offerings or more favorable share prices than others. These kinds of fundamental distinctions will influence the Top 10 rankings of the future.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s So Typical", "Date": "2016-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWordplayTHURSDAY PUZZLE \u2014 Have you ever stared at a word for so long that it stops looking like that word and starts to look like a completely different word?Parker Lewis has demonstrated a love for slicing, dicing and scrambling words in the four crossword puzzles that have run in The New York Times under his byline, and I have become a big fan.Today he collaborates with Jeff Chen of XWord Info to offer us a puzzle that might require two or more glances at the theme entries to uncover the trick, but it\u2019s well worth your time. I know that it had me snorting all the way through.Today\u2019s three theme clues at 17-, 36- and 53A might seem kind of stretchy, but they actually describe the goings-on in the theme pretty well.If you take a fairly long word like RECONSIDERATION (17A) and slice it up into three parts, what you wind up with (that still makes sense) is RECON SIDE RATION. That sums up \u201cNot the main food allotment for one on an intel mission?\u201d Now you slice up the other two theme entries, and you should wind of with a set of the following:17A: RECONSIDERATION = RECON SIDE RATION [\u201cNot the main food allotment for one on an intel mission?\u201d]36A: TEMPERAMENTALLY = TEMPE RAMEN TALLY [\u201cNoodle count in one of Arizona\u2019s largest cities?\u201d]53A: NONCOMMUNICABLE = NONCOM MUNI CABLE [\u201cSarge\u2019s \u2018Sell my city bonds!\u2019 telegram?\u201d]As I would have expected from a Lewis-Chen puzzle, there is a lot of good stuff in the puzzle outside the theme. The constructors introduced eight entries today (including two of the theme entries) and, in non-debut news, I liked IDRIS Elba, MYST, LOOK IT UP, DAILY PLANET, SPRAY TAN, BLIND ALLEYS, SURE DO, WET MARTINIS (I like them any way I can get them), HONEYMOONED and ROSHAMBO.\u2022 10A: Remember: Abbreviated clue means an abbreviated entry, so \u201cCorp. recruiters\u2019 targets\u201d would be M.B.A.S.\u2022 15A: One of the founders of the NAACP was a suffragist and civil rights activist named Mary White Ovington. Ms. Ovington grew up in a family that supported women\u2019s rights and had been part of the antislavery movement. When I first solved this, I wished that the clue had credited one of the black founders, like W.E.B. DuBois, but Mr. DuBois has been used in clues a number of times. My best guess about this is that an attempt was made to come up with a fresh clue.\u202222A: I have this theory that for every moment in life there is an equivalent \u201cSeinfeld\u201d moment, so I truly wanted the answer to \u201cLike the cinnamon in babka\u201d this to be LESSER, as in \u201clesser babka\u201d:\u2022 2D: Hands up if you had RAH before OL\u00c9 for the \u201cTwo-syllable cheer.\u201d\u2022 24D: I loved this clue. \u201cDid a tour after joining up?\u201d sounds like someone enlisted in the military, but we\u2019ve been misdirected: you can also join up in wedded bliss and go on your honeymoon.\u2022 27D: More misdirection! \u201cBiblical mount\u201d suggests a mountain like Ararat, but today we\u2019re thinking about mounts that someone can ride, like a CAMEL.\u2022 56D: I stared at this one for a while before I understood why the answer to \u201cBe on the level?\u201d is LIE. I\u2019m thinking that if you\u2019re lying down (horizontal), you\u2019re basically level. What do you think?We each took a crack at finding 15-letter words that could be split into 5/5/5 or 4/5/6 or 4/4/7. After sifting through a bunch of junk, we settled on these three. Here are a few alternates that didn\u2019t quite make the cut:HYPER/CRITIC/ALLYINTER/MEDIA/TINGTOUGH/MINDED/NESSLIEU/TENANTS/HIPSAPP/RENT/ICES/HIPSSTAND/OF/FISH/NESSThe first version we submitted included the revealer THE SPLITS clued as [Show of flexibility ... and what 16\u2212, 25\u2212, and 40\u2212Across each do]. It was deemed to be not such a great addition to the main theme so we decided to rework the puzzle. With only three theme entries, we tried to construct a wide-open grid with as much fresh fill as possible. Hope you all enjoy the result.And, as many others have said, it\u2019s a great pleasure to work with Jeff!Both of us are recreational programmers (me much hackier than Parker, who actually works in the field). It occurred to me that his TEMPE/RAMEN/TALLY seed idea might be a fun project to expand my coding skills, and after a few attempts, I figured out a way to at least narrow down my list into a subset that might be reasonably human-scannable.Et voila, the other two popped out! (After about 10 hours of line-by-line searching.) HYPER CRITIC ALLY was also a possibility, but it wasn\u2019t nearly as nice, as it didn\u2019t change the \u201ccritic\u201d meaning at all.To the credit of Parker and his programming skills, he came up with these ... and a bunch of others (mentioned above). Shows you what I know.Nicely done, Mr. Lewis and Mr. Chen.Your thoughts?Join us as we crush the Thursday puzzle each week on The New York Times\u2019s Facebook page:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wrongfully Convicted of Rape, a New Jersey Man Finds More Punishment After Prison", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "Supported byExonerations of wrongfully convicted people have become so routine in recent years that their stories are almost commonplace. We think we know the narrative: A defendant languishes in prison for a crime he did not commit; through tenacious legal work \u2014 or the magic of DNA tests \u2014 he is freed.Then there are stories like Dion Harrell\u2019s, which show that the suffering attached to unjust verdicts can linger even after the innocent are sprung from their prison cells.Nearly 30 years ago, at 22, Mr. Harrell was arrested on suspicion of raping a teenage girl and later served four years in a New Jersey prison. But when he was released on parole, what amounted to his second sentence started: For the next two decades, he had to live with the restrictions of the state\u2019s sex-offender statute, known as Megan\u2019s Law.On Wednesday, Mr. Harrell, now 50, is to be formally cleared of the rape charge in State Superior Court in Freehold, N.J., officially foreclosing his legal tribulations. But he said that even an exoneration, as welcome as it is, would not entirely end his ordeal.\u201cIt\u2019s never going to leave me,\u201d he said in an interview this week. \u201cI\u2019m scarred for life, no matter what.\u201dIn September 1988, Mr. Harrell was arrested in the rape of a 17-year-old girl as she was walking home from her job at a McDonald\u2019s in Long Branch, N.J. A neighborhood guy who often played basketball with local police detectives, Mr. Harrell lived across the street from the fast-food restaurant. When he was arrested, the victim immediately identified him as her assailant.\u201cThe cops were like, \u2018Why\u2019d you do it?\u2019\u201d Mr. Harrell said. \u201cI was like, \u2018Do what?\u2019 They said, \u2018Why\u2019d you rape her?\u2019 I just broke down crying. I still cry \u2014 it hurts.\u201dMr. Harrell was found guilty in 1992, and from 1993 to 1997, he was imprisoned at the Mid-State Correctional Facility at the Fort Dix Army base. When he was released, he was required under Megan\u2019s Law to be added to the state\u2019s sex-offender registry. The law, which was named for Megan Kanka, a 7-year-old girl who was raped and murdered near Trenton in 1994, precluded him from living near children. Though he wanted at first to move in with his sister, his sister had two sons, both of whom were minors at the time. So state agencies helped him find a hotel room, he said, where he lived for nearly a year.Meanwhile, his name and image were spread across the internet \u2014 not only on the state\u2019s website, but also on private pages that alert residents to sex offenders living in their area. He said he was spotted in \u2014 and hounded out of \u2014 bars. Friends, and friends of friends, posted insults on his Facebook page. Landlords did not want him in their buildings. Employers refused to hire him.\u201cHe served four years in prison,\u201d Ms. Potkin said, \u201cbut was in essence sentenced to decades of instability.\u201dWhile still in prison, Mr. Harrell had written to the Innocence Project asking for help in getting a DNA test that he hoped would clear his name. \u201cThe reason I am writing your office,\u201d his original letter read, \u201cis because I am innocent of the crime.\u201d He added that he \u201ccannot begin to explain\u201d the psychological trauma he had endured.At that point, however, the organization already had thousands of defendants on its waiting list. It was also difficult, Ms. Potkin said, to correspond with Mr. Harrell because of his transient living situation.Eventually, in 2014, she took the case. She faced an immediate hurdle: Under New Jersey law at the time, only defendants still in prison were entitled to a DNA test. (The law has since been amended.)It is hard to know precisely how many cases like Mr. Harrell\u2019s exist across the country. But one man who experienced a similar ordeal is Eddie Lowery, a former Army specialist, who in 1982 was wrongfully convicted of raping a 63-year-old woman as she lay sleeping in her home in Ogden, Kan. Mr. Lowery, who is now 57 and lives in California, served 10 years in prison. When he got out and had to register as a sex offender, he was so afraid of being recognized that he hid his house\u2019s address plate behind a flower pot.\u201cIt was almost like I was still in a prison on the outside,\u201d he said the other day. \u201cEven though I was out, I wasn\u2019t free.\u201dFor the moment, Mr. Harrell is living with a relative in Long Branch. He is still unemployed, but at least he can visit his sister again. He has been spending time with his two daughters, who are 25 and 27. Although he has not healed yet, he is looking forward to Wednesday when a judge will officially set him free.\u201cIt\u2019ll get me out of the hellhole,\u201d he said.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the year of the rape that Dion Harrell was convicted of. As the article correctly notes, it was in 1988, not 1992.Advertisement"}

As of Wednesday, the deaths appeared to be concentrated in four communities: at least 86 in the towns of Amatrice and Accumoli, in Lazio, and at least 32 in Marche, in the village of Arquata del Tronto and the hamlet of Pescara del Tronto.On Thursday, the Italian Civil Protection Department said 241 people were confirmed dead, and hundreds more injured.Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, speaking Wednesday from Rieti, a city in Lazio near the epicenter, likened the affected communities to \u201ca family that has been hit but won\u2019t stop.\u201d He vowed that the government would quickly start to rebuild, noting widespread anger over the long delays in rebuilding after the 2009 quake. \u201cReconstruction is what will allow this community to live and to restart,\u201d he said.Immacolata Postiglione, the head of the emergency unit for the Civil Protection Department, said on Wednesday that more than 1,000 people were expected to spend the night in four camps being set up in the area. She added that an unknown number of tourists had not been fully accounted for. \u201cThe number of missing people is undefined at the moment,\u201d she said.\u201cThe problem is removing people from under the rubble,\u201d he said. Asked how many people he thought were still trapped or dead underneath debris, he said, \u201cMany, many.\u201dMr. Pirozzi added that Amatrice had been cut off because of damage to roads and a bridge, and in a live television broadcast, he appealed for assistance.The town\u2019s missing reportedly included two refugees from Afghanistan and three nuns and four older guests at a local boardinghouse. The town\u2019s hospital had to be evacuated, but its patients were not injured, the news agency ANSA reported.The hamlet of Pescara del Tronto was all but destroyed.Ambulances raced back and forth on one of the main roads to Amatrice, where a courtyard in a still-standing palazzo had been turned into an impromptu morgue.Towns in a mountainous stretch of central Italy were severely damaged by an earthquake that killed hundreds of people and trapped scores under debris.CNN showed footage of construction equipment\u2019s being used to try to comb through giant pieces of debris in Amatrice and of rescuers standing on huge piles of rubble where homes once stood, evidence of the enormous scale of the rescue effort.\u201cWe need chain saws, shears to cut iron bars and jacks to remove beams,\u201d a civil protection worker, Andrea Gentili, told The Associated Press. \u201cEverything, we need everything.\u201dNonprofit agencies put out calls for blood donations.

Italian officials said it was difficult to gauge the number of casualties or the damage as the ground kept trembling through the night.Fabrizio Curcio, the director of the Civil Protection Department, said that the earthquake had been severe and that national emergency procedures had been activated.Mr. Curcio said mayors in the affected areas were monitoring the destruction. \u201cThey know the territory best,\u201d he said.By early morning, rescue operations had been able to reach the most damaged towns, he said, adding, \u201cWe have to carry out an analysis of the territory and see if there are other places that have to be reached.\u201dOn social media, there were many reports of friends or relatives\u2019 being buried or trapped, and local residents said that the rescue effort was hindered by the fact that teams were having difficulty getting to the mountainous area, where most towns are reachable only along winding country roads.In Norcia, dozens of residents wrapped in blankets greeted the dawn in the town\u2019s main square. \u201cMuch of our patrimony is damaged, but there are no victims,\u201d Mayor Nicola Alemanno told RaiNews24. \u201cThat is the good news.\u201dThe United States Geological Survey said the people in the region lived in structures that were a \u201cmix of vulnerable and earthquake-resistant construction.\u201dGaia Pianigiani contributed reporting from Siena, Italy; Sewell Chan from London; and Christopher Mele from New York.Advertisement"}

At the very least, a diverse work force can help guard against them making choices that offend large swaths of their potential userbase. Even more than that, a diverse work force can help them come up with new ideas that may not have occurred to 20-something Stanford bros.One would hope this doesn\u2019t happen again, but this is tech: anything goes, however terrible.On that note, have a good weekend, friend!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Even Uber Couldn\u2019t Bridge the China Divide", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtTravis Kalanick, the co-founder and chief executive of the ride-hailing giant Uber, often defended his eagerness to risk billions on winning the Chinese market with a simple question: If you have a chance to become Amazon and Alibaba at the same time, why not try?The implication was simple. Over the last couple of decades, Amazon, Facebook, Google and other American technology giants have each followed a similar script for world domination. Like an imperial armada rolling out from North America\u2019s West Coast, these companies would try to establish beachheads on every other continent.But when American giants tried to enter the waters of China, the world\u2019s largest internet market, the armada invariably ran aground.Plagued by opaque and ever-shifting regulations and a culturally abstruse way of doing business, American companies fell to a series of local giants. Instead of Google, Baidu. Instead of Facebook, WeChat, owned by the giant Tencent. And instead of Amazon, Alibaba.That has left us with a divide: Today, there is the Chinese internet, and there is the internet of the rest of the world. A network seen in its early days as a tool to foster financial and political unity across a fragmented planet has irrevocably cleaved into two completely separate spheres.Entrepreneurs across the globe can choose to win in China or the rest of the world. You can be Alibaba or you can be Amazon. You can be Uber or you can be Didi. But you can\u2019t be both. Given the rising Chinese market and increasing tension over the role of American tech firms in the rest of the globe, the gulf between the two sides promises to become one of the most important factors in determining the shape of global tech innovation.How exactly might the war play out? In some ways, being at the mercy of two poles of internet leadership could be good for citizens of planet Earth. In emerging markets like India, the Middle East and parts of Africa and South America, the giants of China and the United States are increasingly investing billions to compete for local customers in e-commerce, social networking, ride sharing and other markets.\u201cAmazon is increasingly making its own branded products, taking on Procter & Gamble and others, and also getting into the logistics business, and shipping, and everything else,\u201d Mr. Clark said. \u201cBut Alibaba is a marketplace that doesn\u2019t hold inventory and describes themselves as helping local merchants \u2014 so maybe there\u2019s some argument that Alibaba could serve as a counter globally to Amazon.\u201d\u201cIn that way it could be like the Yalta Conference,\u201d said Mr. Clark, referring to the 1945 meeting in which the victors of World War II determined the postwar geopolitical order.\u201cThe barrels that will be thrown at you when you\u2019re trying to do business in China will just never stop,\u201d said Mark Natkin, the managing director of Marbridge Consulting, an advisory firm based in Beijing. \u201cYou\u2019ll constantly be above one barrel or recovering from jumping one, and as you\u2019re dusting yourself off you look down the road and here comes the next one.\u201dCompared with previous failures, Uber seemed to do everything right in China. It set up a separate company, Uber China, which had a buy-in from local investors, including from a local giant, Baidu. It hired many local experts, and worked closely with the national government to foster friendly relations.Insiders say Mr. Kalanick was also personally invested in the deal. He visited China eight times in the last year and a half, and became something of a tech star in the Chinese media.Publicly Mr. Kalanick had insisted he was fighting for total victory in China. But he must have known that Uber would always struggle to achieve dominance, given the emerging centrality of ride-sharing to the future of infrastructure in China. Still, even if he failed to win everything in China, investing early in the country seemed too big to skip.For now, it\u2019s especially delicious frosting. The $2 billion Uber spent tackling China is now worth about $7 billion in the new merged entity; if Didi does become one of China\u2019s largest tech companies, the value of Uber\u2019s stake in China could rise geometrically, making the firm much more attractive in a potential initial public offering. Pulling out of China also frees up Uber to invest more in other markets \u2014 India and Indonesia are big targets \u2014 as well as expand its expertise in core technological initiatives like mapping data and self-driving cars.But if spending big to tackle China ultimately works out for Uber, it will be an anomaly, and certainly not a model for other American tech giants.\u201cThe ride-sharing market is one the few markets where the upside is big enough to justify going in,\u201d Mr. Thompson said. \u201cFor most other companies, going into China is still going to be nothing but pain.\u201dEmail: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}

He was 66.Juan Gabriel released the first of several dozen albums in 1971 and continued to release records at a relentless pace, including two this year. He was nominated for six Grammy Awards and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1996, he was inducted into the Billboard Latin Music Hall of Fame.He was adept at keeping up with shifting genres, combining a contemporary pop sensibility with traditional Mexican music, often appearing with a full mariachi band in tow. A populist at heart, he wrote and sang songs that focused on the everyday dramas of life and love.He also had collaborative spirit, working with well-known Latin American artists like Ana Gabriel and Marc Anthony, many of whom covered his songs.Juan Gabriel was born Alberto Aguilera Valadez on Jan. 7, 1950, in the state of Michoacan, on the Pacific coast west of Mexico City. One of 10 siblings, he was initially raised by his mother and began writing his own songs at age 13.His father, Gabriel Aguilera, was committed to a mental hospital, and his mother took the family to Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, across the Texas border from El Paso. Unable to support Gabriel, she placed him in a children\u2019s home when he was 5. It was there that he met Juan Contreras, a deaf musician who had played in a band. Juan Gabriel chose the stage name in honor of both his father and Mr. Contreras, his first teacher.In an interview with the Mexican newspaper La Jornada in 2012, to mark the 40th anniversary of his musical career, Juan Gabriel said both the pain and the joys of his childhood coursed through his music.\u201cEveryone who gave me food, who took away my hunger, inspired me to compose,\u201d he said. \u201cThey told me their stories, and I had no other way to console them than with a piece of music, and that is how I learned. I did not resolve their problems with my songs, but I created a moment of release. They would cry, and they had more affection for me, and that is how I grew up.\u201dHe ran away from the children\u2019s home at 14. \u201cOne day I took out the garbage and never went back,\u201d he said.He played in the nightclubs of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, but he had set his hopes on a bigger prize and set out for Mexico City. Accused of stealing a guitar, he spent a year and a half in the city\u2019s Lecumberri prison.His luck changed when the ranchera singer Enriqueta Jim\u00e9nez heard him and persuaded her producers to hire him.Early hits like \u201cNo Tengo Dinero\u201d (1971) focused on his humble beginnings, making him something of a folk hero.Juan Gabriel stopped recording and performing for several years in the 1980s while battling his record label, BMG, for control of his music. He eventually came to an agreement with the company and gained control of many of his songs.There was no immediate word on his survivors.In a tell-all book, \u201cJuan Gabriel and I,\u201d a former secretary of Juan Gabriel\u2019s, Joaqu\u00edn Mu\u00f1oz, said that he and Juan Gabriel had had a sexual relationship, The A.P. reported, an assertion that Juan Gabriel did not confirm or deny. Years later it became known that he had fathered four children with a friend, Laura Salas.\u201cHis were not simple concerts, they were religious, mystical and communal experiences,\u201d Mr. Vel\u00e1zquez wrote. \u201cHis lyrics made up not songs, but rather hymns.\u201dElisabeth Malkin and Paulina Villegas contributed reporting from Mexico City.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Think Tanks Amplify Corporate America\u2019s Influence", "Date": "2016-08-07", "News": "Supported by\u201cThis can become a productive, mutually beneficial relationship,\u201d Bruce Katz, a Brookings vice president, wrote to Lennar in July 2010. The ultimate benefit for Brookings: $400,000 in donations from Lennar\u2019s different divisions.\u201cHe would be a trusted adviser,\u201d an internal Brookings memo said in 2014 as the think tank sought one $100,000 donation from Lennar.Think tanks, which position themselves as \u201cuniversities without students,\u201d have power in government policy debates because they are seen as researchers independent of moneyed interests. But in the chase for funds, think tanks are pushing agendas important to corporate donors, at times blurring the line between researchers and lobbyists. And they are doing so while reaping the benefits of their tax-exempt status, sometimes without disclosing their connections to corporate interests.Similar arrangements exist at many think tanks. On issues as varied as military sales to foreign countries, international trade, highway management systems and real estate development, think tanks have frequently become vehicles for corporate influence and branding campaigns.The shift has occurred as nonprofits in general have been under increasing pressure from their donors to meet specific goals. But for think tanks, that pressure can threaten their standing as independent arbiters in policy debates in Congress, the White House and the news media.\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice to go back to the greatest generation, in the post-World War II era of philanthropy, where they said, gosh, \u2018Here is $1 million; spend it how you wish,\u2019\u201d Kimberly Churches, the managing director at Brookings, said in an interview.Think tank executives reject any suggestion that they are tools of corporate influence campaigns and say they are simply teaming up with donors that have similar goals, like helping cities with economic development.But he acknowledged that the arrangement to appoint the Lennar executive as a senior fellow had created the \u201cappearance of a conflict of interest.\u201d And he said that Brookings, in the interest of transparency, had recently decided to prohibit corporations or corporate-backed foundations from making anonymous contributions.Still, the benefits afforded to corporations looking to cloak themselves with the authority of think tanks are strikingly evident, according to a review of documents from more than a dozen institutions.The likely conclusions of some think tank reports, documents show, are discussed with donors \u2014 or even potential ones \u2014 before the research is complete. Drafts of the studies have been shared with donors whose opinions have then helped shape final reports. Donors have outlined how the resulting scholarship will be used as part of broader lobbying efforts. The think tanks also help donors promote their corporate brands, as Brookings does with JPMorgan Chase, whose $15.5 million contribution is the largest by a private corporation in the institution\u2019s history.Despite these benefits, corporations can write off the donations as charitable contributions. Some tax experts say these arrangements may amount to improper subsidies by taxpayers if think tanks are providing specific services.The Brookings Institution \u2014 long recognized as one of the most prestigious think tanks in the world \u2014 has aggressively courted corporate donors over the last decade, particularly for its Metropolitan Policy Program, which formed partnerships with JPMorgan Chase, Lennar Corporation, K.K.R., Hitachi and others. Here is an examination of the deals with these donors, based in part on thousands of pages of internal Brookings documents.Executives at Brookings, the Center for Strategic and International Studies and other think tanks say they have systems in place to ensure that their reports are based on scholars\u2019 independent conclusions.\u201c\u2018Are you going to say drones are bad?\u2019\u201d she recalled one potential financial backer asking. \u201c\u2018We are not interested in funding something that says drones are bad.\u2019\u201dThe confidential Brookings spreadsheet had an unassuming title: Corporate Overviews Tracking. It listed nearly 90 corporations, from Alcoa to Wells Fargo, providing a glimpse of the vast electronic file that Brookings maintained on donors and prospects, and the benefits it might offer.The database, along with thousands of pages of emails, solicitations for money and memos on meetings with corporate officials, highlighted Brookings\u2019s practice of assuring that donors would see results from their contributions.The files included company priorities and a tally of donations. General Electric wanted to fund work on rail networks and clean energy programs \u2014 both critical parts of its business \u2014 and Brookings then featured G.E. executives, joined by officials from the White House and Congress, at events that focused on these industries.From the start, the program blended a variety of insights on urban matters, including from corporate, nonprofit and government sources. And Mr. Indyk noted that any reports issued were made public.Donations to the program exploded, from $4.3 million in 2005 to $12.5 million in 2013, nearly 20 percent of Brookings\u2019s overall program spending that year.In advance of a 2014 event Brookings officials attended with corporate executives including Henry R. Kravis, a co-chairman of K.K.R., one memo marked as confidential noted: \u201cK.K.R. has given a total of $350K to Brookings. Last gift came in on 3/27/2014 for $150K to Metro; Henry has donated $75K to Brookings, most going to the individual unrestricted fund.\u201dThe tally demonstrates the important distinction that Brookings makes between \u201cunrestricted\u201d donations, which the think tank can spend on any research, and project-based funding restricted to specific topics that the donor has a particular interest in.The San Francisco project generated controversy from the beginning, with critics concerned about toxic waste left by the former Navy shipyard.A spokesman for Lennar, Glenn Bunting, disputed claims that the company had donated to Brookings out of self-interest \u2014 and said the alliance was not related to the protests.\u201cThere was nothing needed in the way of assistance for Lennar to \u2018buy\u2019 from Brookings,\u201d Mr. Bunting said in an email. Brookings, though, continued to promote the project.The think tank soon delivered.But Mr. Indyk acknowledged that naming Mr. Bonner, who declined to be interviewed, a Brookings nonresident scholar had \u201ccreated the impression that because Lennar was giving money, he was getting the title.\u201d His post, which was unpaid, was not renewed.Officials at Brookings said they had not lobbied for Hitachi, and they provided examples of reports that they said included conclusions challenging the company\u2019s position. \u201cHelping a corporation\u2019s for-profit agenda is not in any way our agenda,\u201d Ms. Churches, the managing director, said.Yet Ms. Churches also said the contract language with donors like Lennar and Hitachi was \u201cinelegant,\u201d although not improper.When asked if the documents read like a fee-for-service agreement, she said, \u201cIt could be misconstrued.\u201dMr. Indyk said Brookings had recently changed its policies so that \u201ctoday, there is no way in which those words would be used in our documents.\u201dThe project was premised on a common interest between the bank and the think tank. Brookings wanted to promote economic growth in cities by encouraging international trade, and JPMorgan wanted to gain new business by offering loans to companies in the same markets.Mr. Indyk and executives from JPMorgan said the company and the think tank simply agreed on a worthy agenda.\u201cThis was about growing the economy, and we are incredibly proud of the results of this initiative,\u201d said Peter Scher, the head of the corporate responsibility program at JPMorgan. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s had a huge impact in more than 30 cities that are involved.\u201dAt the same time, hundreds of pages of memos \u2014 status reports to JPMorgan, internal reports by Brookings staff to prepare for meetings with top bank executives, and formal documents soliciting more money \u2014 make clear that Brookings saw the Global Cities Initiative as a branding effort that could help JPMorgan bolster its standing in cities.And Brookings was ready to do its part.At times, Brookings officials seemed worried they were not doing enough for the bank.\u201cNo one wants to create overt marketing opportunities for JPMC, but we need to carve out roles and thought leadership opportunity for market presidents,\u201d said a 2013 Brookings memo, referring to a dinner with the bank\u2019s executives. \u201cWe need to do a better job tying it back to JPMC.\u201dIt remains difficult to assess whether the relationship helped the bank\u2019s business, but Mr. Scher said that was not the goal.\u201cIf the Global Cities Initiative strengthens the economic competitiveness of cities, it\u2019s a win for small businesses, job creation and everyone involved in these communities, including us,\u201d Mr. Scher said in a statement.Donations from the corporations to Brookings are tax exempt based on the premise that the think tank\u2019s work benefits the public good, not a company\u2019s bottom line.\u201cTax deductions are subsidies that are paid for by all taxpayers,\u201d Ms. Fleischer said. \u201cAnd the reason the subsidy is provided is that the charitable organization is supposed to be doing something for the public good, not that specifically benefits the private individual or corporation in the form of providing them goods or services.\u201dMr. Indyk said that opinion was \u201ctotally unfounded,\u201d noting that Brookings had retained its own lawyers to review the documents and found no problems.Other think tanks have been even more closely aligned with corporate agendas.The Atlantic Council, which has seen its annual revenue grow to $21 million from $2 million in the last decade, offers access to United States and foreign government officials in exchange for contributions. Individual donors, like FedEx, have also helped fund specific reports that align with their agendas.Six months before the Atlantic Council report was issued, FedEx and the think tank worked on plans to use the report as a lobbying tool.FedEx and the Atlantic Council, working with the European American Chamber of Commerce, also told companies being asked to participate in the study that the goal was to \u201cemphasize the positive impact that a comprehensive agreement would have on American and European small businesses.\u201dAn executive vice president at FedEx, Rajesh Subramaniam, attended an event at Atlantic Council headquarters in Washington to celebrate the release of the final report. So did a key supporter, Representative Erik Paulsen, Republican of Minnesota.Frederick Kempe, the Atlantic Council president, said that FedEx had donated just $20,000 to help fund the effort and that the staff at the Atlantic Council had handled the research.\u201cThere is no doubt the work of think tanks has more credibility than the work of lobbyists, but the only way we preserve it is through intellectual independence,\u201d Mr. Kempe said.General Atomics, the California-based manufacturer of Predator drones, had a clear problem. Prospects for sales were falling as the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq wound down. The company wanted the Obama administration to change its policy to allow for sales to other countries, a lucrative proposition.At about that time, the industry turned to the Center for Strategic and International Studies for help, providing money that the think tank used to conduct a study on drone policy, including exports.While defense contracting giants like Lockheed Martin and Boeing have cumulatively donated at least $77 million since 2010 to two dozen think tanks, disclosure records show, General Atomics\u2019s contribution to the Center for Strategic and International Studies was quite small \u2014 in the tens of thousands of dollars.As General Atomics was lobbying for a change in export rules governing its unmanned aerial vehicles, it helped fund a report at the Center for Strategic and International Studies that also pushed for the change.As a think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies did not file a lobbying report, but the goals of the effort were clear.Boeing and Lockheed Martin, drone makers that were major C.S.I.S. contributors, were also invited to attend the sessions, the emails show. The meetings and research culminated with a report released in February 2014 that reflected the industry\u2019s priorities.\u201cI came out strongly in support of export,\u201d Mr. Brannen, the lead author of the study, wrote in an email to Kenneth B. Handelman, the deputy assistant secretary of state for defense trade controls.But the effort did not stop there.Mr. Brannen, who has since left C.S.I.S., declined to comment. The think tank insisted that its efforts to influence administration policy were not lobbying.\u201cC.S.I.S. will not represent any donor before any government office or entity, including congressional lawmakers and executive branch officials,\u201d Mr. Hamre, the chief executive, said in his statement to The Times. \u201cWe do not lobby.\u201dOne thing is clear: The result was a victory for General Atomics.A State Department spokesman said that while the government officials involved in the review had received opinions from think tanks and industry officials, \u201cat the end of the day, this is a considered U.S. government policy.\u201dLater, after he had joined the Hudson Institute and helped create the Center for American Seapower, he approached Huntington officials again, and they were interested.\u201cA think tank has more prestige,\u201d Mr. McGrath said.Huntington Ingalls paid $100,000 to fund the work, a critical commitment for Mr. McGrath, who said he was paid by Hudson only if he could successfully solicit donations to support his research.Mr. McGrath said he had always been a strong proponent of aircraft carriers, so the company was not buying his opinion.\u201cThe Hudson Center makes no secret about being very pro-sea power,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a company came that wanted us to write a piece that advocated for something other than that, the answer would be no.\u201dIn exchange for Huntington Ingalls\u2019s support, company officials were given regular briefings on the research and the opportunity to suggest revisions to early drafts, Mr. McGrath said.Huntington Ingalls, the sole builder of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers in the United States, and other players in the shipbuilding industry were looking for ways to increase or maintain funding for the construction of these giant ships. They turned to think tanks for help. Here is a look at the strategy, which involved the Hudson Institute and others.\u201cWe have an iterative process already laid out in which we will sit down with them and go through drafts and discuss where we are going,\u201d Mr. McGrath said. He added that he had not accepted all of the company\u2019s suggestions.The strategy \u2014 lining up think tank reports as lobbying tools that echoed each other \u2014 was backed up with a series of letters to the editor, dozens of posts on Twitter and Facebook, and op-ed pieces.Mr. McGrath said he, too, wondered if this storm of industry-funded work might be threatening the integrity of the process.\u201cI see a lot of stuff that comes out in Washington,\u201d Mr. McGrath said, \u201cand I got to scratch my head and say, \u2018That guy must be on the payroll.\u2019\u201dBrooke Williams is a reporter at the New England Center for Investigative Reporting, which collaborated with The New York Times on this series.

{"Headline": "Oklahoma Man Is Charged With Killing Lebanese-American Neighbor", "Date": "2016-08-23", "News": "Supported byHe called the family \u201cdirty Arabs\u201d and tried to run over the mother with a car, the authorities said. An Oklahoma man\u2019s animosity toward the Lebanese-American family living next door, according to court records, took a fatal turn this month when he shot one of the sons on the porch of their house in Tulsa.The man, Vernon Majors, 61, was charged Tuesday with first-degree murder in the killing of his neighbor, Khalid Jabara, 37, on Aug. 12, according to a statement by the district attorney, Steve Kunzweiler.Mr. Majors, who had recently been released on bond after being suspected of hitting Mr. Jabara\u2019s mother with a car, was also charged with possession of a firearm by a felon, threatening an act of violence and malicious intimidation or harassment \u2014 the last count a misdemeanor reflecting the years of racism and violence that the authorities say has pervaded the stretch of grass connecting their yards.Rebecca Abou-Chedid, a friend who is serving as a spokeswoman for the Jabara family, said Mr. Jabara\u2019s death had devastated the tight-knit Lebanese community in Tulsa.\u201cFrom a larger community\u2019s perspective, what they see is a 37-year-old man shot and killed by a man who called them \u2018dirty Arab,\u2019\u201d Ms. Abou-Chedid said in a telephone interview. \u201cThere is no nuance. When people are using ethnic and racial slurs, this isn\u2019t just people being sensitive about it, but that they should be taken seriously.\u201dMarvin Lizama, Mr. Majors\u2019s lawyer for the earlier case, said in an email on Tuesday that he had no comment on the new charges.\u201cThose of us at St. Antony will always remember the young man who grew up in our parish,\u201d the announcement said. \u201cKhalid had a huge heart.\u201dThe American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee said that Mr. Jabara was clearly targeted because of his ethnicity. \u201cThe unfortunate murder of Jabara is a reflection of the impact and power of hateful rhetoric in politics and the society at large,\u201d the group said, adding that allowing such to continue \u201cwill lead to additional hate crimes against minority and immigrant communities.\u201dNews of Mr. Jabara\u2019s death found a home on social media with the trending #justice4khalid, where it was given broader context within the national discussion on race and violence.Like others in Tulsa, the Jabara family, who are Orthodox Christians, can trace their roots back to a village in southern Lebanon called Marjayoun, which families fled to escape war.Mr. Jabara\u2019s parents moved with Khalid and his older sister Victoria in 1983 and settled in the United States, where his younger brother Rami was born, Ms. Abou-Chedid said.While his siblings have moved away, Mr. Jabara had stayed to help with his parents\u2019 catering business and medical care.Mr. Majors, also known as Stanley Vernon Majors, moved next door to the Jabara family in 2011, Ms. Abou-Chedid said. While it was not immediately clear when the troubles started, family and court records document a history of animosity and of calls to the police to report racial slurs, harassment and threats by Mr. Majors.In 2013, Mr. Jabara\u2019s mother, Haifa, took out a protective order against Mr. Majors, which court records show that he violated. In September 2015, Mr. Majors rammed Ms. Jabara with his car, and he was charged with assault and battery, according to the documents.Ms. Jabara had broken bones and a collapsed lung, the family said.In May 2016, the district attorney\u2019s office tried to keep Mr. Majors in jail to await trial, citing his \u201cwanton disregard for the life of the victim and the safety of the public.\u201dMr. Majors, however, was able to make bail and was released.According to the police and Ms. Abou-Chedid, Mr. Jabara was home with his father on Aug. 12 when he called the police out of fear of Mr. Majors. Officer Leland Ashley said the police received a call from the Jabara house saying that Mr. Majors had banged on a window. Ms. Williams said her brother had called the police to report that Mr. Majors had a gun.The police responded but left without taking any action. Then, just before 7 p.m., Officer Ashley said, a neighbor reported that there had been a shooting. Mr. Jabara was taken to the hospital, where he died of his wounds.Mr. Majors was arrested, hiding near a library, about 11 p.m., the officer said.Mr. Kunzweiler, the district attorney, said in an emailed statement before announcing the charges that the family \u201cdid everything they were supposed to do and the system failed them.\u201dMs. Williams said her family had lived \u201cin fear of this man and his hatred for years.\u201d\u201cHe should not have been released without monitoring,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYet he was released and put back next door to us, the family he assaulted just months before. This is troubling at any time, but profoundly disturbing given the current climate of our country and the increase nationally in cases of hate crimes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Protest Looks Like", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe StoneThis theory of the state underlies media and state reporting of political protest, in which violence is always invoked to disqualify the grievances of protesters. In the 1960s, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was able to to use media coverage of disproportionate violence against nonresisting demonstrators in Birmingham or Selma to convey his message as a form of martyrdom. He wrote: \u201cwe\u2019ll wear you down by our capacity to suffer\u2026we will so appeal to your heart and conscience that we will win you in the process.\u201dToday, if police dogs attack demonstrators, it is no longer national news. Ironically, the example of King himself, so often vilified as a traitor and a Communist in his lifetime, is used to berate today\u2019s protesters with the demand for nonviolence, meaning compliance with police instructions. King never intended nonviolence to mean compliance with the state. But when the term violence is used, it now signifies a moral and political failing by the \u201cpeople,\u201d those not authorized to use force. Whenever Palestinians protest against the occupation of their land, the response in some quarters is always to call it violent, no matter what has happened. So I find myself avoiding the term altogether in relation to protests.What activists then did in the U.S. was to create a performative form of protest that insisted we not look away but consider over and over again what had happened. \u201cHands Up, Don\u2019t Shoot\u201d calls our attention to the instant before the definitive violence, a moment where a reasonable person (to use legal phrasing) could and should have decided against shooting, for example, 12-year-old Tamir Rice. By performing this collectively, it also became a challenge to the police, saying in effect, \u201cyou don\u2019t dare to shoot, there are too many of us.\u201dThe mass \u201cdie-in,\u201d an action appropriated from earlier movements in which protesters mime death as a group, further emphasizes that all are potential targets. Performed death, a visual act, makes each person appear vulnerable, but simultaneously creates a sense of freedom as you rest your body with others in spaces where you never normally are at rest. Both these forms of protest create what I call a \u201cpersistent looking,\u201d a repeated return to the place of loss so that it is possible to move past the first shock of violence to an understanding of the systemic violence that brought it about.By comparison, the pictures of the body of Aylan Kurdi, the 3-year-old drowned Syrian toddler who washed up on a Turkish beach, broke through the shield that we all create in what the German philosopher Walter Benjamin called \u201cthe optical unconscious.\u201d An outpouring of grief in the West made it seem as if we were seeing refugees die for the first time, although such drownings have been common for decades. The picture of a Turkish policeman carrying his body resonated because of its association (whether conscious or not) with the Christian image known as the piet\u00e0, in which the Virgin Mary carries the body of the dead Christ. We looked at Aylan\u2019s body and realized that he had indeed died for our sins.A few months later, however, Britain voted to leave the European Union, largely because of intense resentment of all immigrants, including refugees. Here, then, is the dilemma. Certain images have the capacity to break through the defenses of our optical unconscious, but precisely because that unconscious is a way of dealing with the intense violence of modern life, it seals over quickly. When these moments occur, change results only if people organize around the general principle that such images convey.Black Lives Matter has done this. But in the case of Aylan Kurdi, while efforts were made for individual refugees, no general case for immigration and asylum was effectively promoted after his death. Still less did Western media outlets turn to the Kurdish community for understanding.Within these activist communities online, people often speak of being connected by love. This love is not romantic love between individuals but the collective bond that Dr. King called \u201cthe beloved community.\u201d For his colleague and friend Grace Lee Boggs, the result was what she called \u201cvisionary organizing.\u201d Such organizing thinks about how to make a life, not make a living. These exchanges are horizontal, requiring a good deal of time and energy to sustain. But they can make change.These are times for visionary organizing, not outraged reposting.There have been two notable responses to the breakdown of the space of appearance. Former protesters and the disillusioned have either set out to create a new politics of appearance or they have reacted by looking for groups to blame.From the Zapatistas to the global Occupy project and today\u2019s Nuit Debout movement in France, the politics of appearance is no longer about submitting a petition to power, but instead organizing so that people can appear to each other. That means suspending the regulation of the space of appearance by norms, above all the norms of racial hierarchy, and then refusing to move on out of that space. I believe that is why Black Lives Matter has acted to disrupt all the major presidential campaigns in 2016. It is seeking to form a new manner of being \u201cpolitical,\u201d a new way to see and be seen in the world.But the other possibility, the blaming of other groups, is a reaction to a sense of powerlessness. As we have seen in the past, these reactions are not correlated to factual evidence or even specific local experience. The Brexit vote was above all motivated by a hostility to immigration. But those voting on these grounds often live in places with low immigration, just as anti-Semitism in the past did not result from proximity to Jewish people.\u201cTake back control\u201d in Britain and \u201cMake America great again\u201d are, then, calls for a re-regulation of the space of appearance to exclude certain groups.When Trump speaks of a wall, his followers understand this to mean both a physical structure (which may or may not actually be constructed) and, more importantly, a conceptual exclusion from participation.There is no \u201ccommon ground\u201d between the politics of appearance and those of exclusion. In the United States, as the Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza has noted, \u201cwhen black people get free, everybody gets free.\u201d Which means that unless black people get free, nobody gets free. Until and unless there is a politics of recognition that might form a new space of appearance that is not structured on exclusion, there will be no liberation.But the resurgent politics of exclusion sometimes overwhelms our sense of that necessity. We seek expedient solutions and look to established leaders. Brexit showed that the defense of what W.E.B. Du Bois called the psychological \u201cwage\u201d of whiteness, its relative privileges, was more important to the majority population than actual economics. If Hillary Clinton fails to realize that it is no longer \u201cthe economy, stupid,\u201d a second reactionary victory might occur.Talk of tolerance and diversity has failed. The urgent task at hand, especially for people who are not themselves black, is to construct an anti-racist politics that is a common good. As Dr. King long ago realized, such politics can only work in tandem with anti-poverty and antiwar strategies. In the end, it comes down to this: When we see another person, do we see them as another human being, not just equal to us in law, but someone that we can listen to, learn from and fall in love with? Or not?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sydney Morning Herald Faces Uncertain Print Future in Australia", "Date": "2016-08-17", "News": "Supported byThey pushed for women to get the vote in Australia\u2019s national elections. They brought down a central bank board member. And they helped convict a state official.The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and their sister publications at Fairfax Media have been among the most powerful voices in Australia for more than 150 years, shaping public opinion on politics, exposing shady business practices and targeting vast criminal operations. Once mocked as a \u201cGranny\u201d for its cautious, worldly perspective, The Herald long ago embraced the reputation and the nickname.But Fairfax\u2019s newspapers now face a diminished future, with company executives even discussing whether to stop printing The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age on weekdays. If they do, it would signal a new low in the decline of the global newspaper business, the radical retreat of centuries-old, mainstream metropolitan newspapers with national influence.The prospect has dismayed many Australians who wonder what it means for civic life and what it says about the country\u2019s place in the world. Australians consider themselves a highly informed and highly educated society, despite their geographic isolation. And The Herald and Age, with a history of sending correspondents to far-flung locales like the battlefields of Europe and Southeast Asia, have been central to the discourse.The weakening of independent voices like The Herald also leaves the Australian market increasingly dominated by the partisan agenda of News Corporation, which owns the country\u2019s top three newspapers by weekday circulation. The struggles at Fairfax represent an especially satisfying victory for News Corporation, run by the homegrown billionaire Rupert Murdoch, who turned his family\u2019s original asset \u2014 a single provincial Australian newspaper \u2014 into a global media empire. Although News Corporation has faced its own financial strains, its other successful businesses, like a real estate website, have provided better support for its journalistic operations.Trouble at Fairfax Media \u201cconstitutes a crisis in civic journalism in our country, because the resources will no longer be there,\u201d said Eric Beecher, a former top editor at The Herald and at News Corporation who is now the publisher of Crikey, a news website. \u201cThe Age and The Sydney Morning Herald have always done the heavy lifting of civic journalism and investigative journalism.\u201dEven by the newspaper industry\u2019s standards, readers of Australia\u2019s print newspapers have been declining at an unusually rapid rate.The chief executive for Fairfax Media, Greg Hywood, said the company had not made a decision whether to halt weekday printing, although it was under review. If printing is halted, he said, the company\u2019s journalistic approach would not be affected.\u201cOur readers have never been hungrier for good-quality news reporting,\u201d Mr. Hywood said.When The Herald opened its state-of-the-art, $260 million presses in 1995, the newspaper\u2019s Saturday edition was a hefty 400 pages. The company predicted it would easily grow to 600 pages.After all, The Herald and the rest of the Fairfax Media papers had practically cornered the market in Sydney and Melbourne for classified advertising for cars, jobs and real estate. Those so-called rivers of gold helped support a robust reporting operation.\u201cWe wondered how on earth we would print a paper that size,\u201d said Mr. Hywood, who was once the Washington correspondent for another Fairfax newspaper, The Australian Financial Review.It was also the same year that Fairfax started its first digital news site, in retrospect, roughly the peak for the print business.The Saturday edition has now shrunk to around 200 pages. Fairfax has cut more than 500 jobs at city newspapers over the last five years, including 100 in April, according to Australia\u2019s union for journalists. And last year The Herald\u2019s cherished printing presses were sold for $34 million.The headwinds now buffeting The Herald and Age are global, as the internet erodes the protections once afforded by geography. There\u2019s the ubiquitous competition from Facebook and Google. Digital native publications like BuzzFeed and The Huffington Post each have small Australian newsrooms without the sizable costs of legacy papers like The Herald.The \u201crivers of gold\u201d have evaporated. Advertising and subscriptions have particularly wilted on weekdays; weekends now represent two-thirds of the revenues at Fairfax\u2019s major newspapers.In the sign of the depths of the print problems, the company this month wrote off much of its investment in the newspapers. Fairfax\u2019s main saving grace has been its fast-growing real estate website, Domain, which has helped offset the losses.Such industry challenges forced papers in some large American cities to rethink their print presence years ago. The Times-Picayune of New Orleans cut printing to three days a week, while The Seattle Post-Intelligencer is online only. Facing cutthroat competition in the crowded British market, The Independent in London, which started in the 1980s to shake up the media establishment, went digital this year.Some of The Herald\u2019s wounds were self-inflicted.As the dot-com boom took off and media companies moved online, Fairfax separated its digital operations, in the hope of eventually taking the group public. At The Herald, there were two newsrooms, one for the newspaper and one for the web.The division created a rift. A younger online staff chased clicks, loading the site up with gossip-fueled content, heavy on sex, celebrity and crime. It rankled more seasoned veterans in the print newsroom, who lamented the shift away from weightier topics like the domestic economy and global politics.\u201cIt was viewed that online there was a lot more Paris Hilton than Paris, France, and that to win online you needed to be a tabloid newspaper,\u201d said Mark Scott, a former Fairfax executive who most recently served as chief executive of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. \u201cThe Herald\u2019s strength had always been its great quality, broadsheet traditions.\u201dThe newsrooms were eventually merged and the website now takes a somewhat more balanced approach. But stories about Kylie Jenner\u2019s Vogue cover and the abs of Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, are still intermingled online with more hard-hitting newspaper articles about the terror links in a child care fraud and the serious flaws in the country\u2019s census.Like many media operations, Fairfax is trying to strike a difficult balance. The meatier topics may play well to the newspaper audience, generally an older crowd.

The Herald is the nation\u2019s leading website, by the number of paying subscribers.\u201cThat can be criticized by people who prefer highbrow content,\u201d said Megan Brownlow, an executive director in the Sydney offices of PricewaterhouseCoopers, the consulting firm. \u201cBut when you\u2019re in a numbers game like internet advertising, highbrow content is hard to monetize.\u201dEven so, it strikes a nerve within the newsroom, which worries about losing its voice within Australian society.The ranks of The Herald, like so many newspapers around the world, have been decimated by cuts over the years.

They had only known a world where another fund-raise was just around the corner.\u201dSilicon Valley start-ups were set to face a great reckoning in 2016. Yet the crash hasn\u2019t happened.The worst fallout may yet come, but many of the start-ups have hung on. Across Silicon Valley, engineers are still commanding annual salaries that average $136,000, according to Hired, a recruiting firm. Demand is brisk for $4 buttered toast, and office space rents remain near record highs. The biggest start-ups, like Uber and Airbnb, continue to land billions of dollars in funding. And investors are shoveling money into venture capital funds, which raised so much cash in the first half of this year that it rivaled the amount raised in all of 2015.For all of the hand-wringing, \u201cthere just hasn\u2019t been much of a downturn,\u201d said Paul Buchheit, a managing partner at Y Combinator, a prominent start-up incubator that nurtured companies including Dropbox and Airbnb. \u201cI don\u2019t even see many companies going out of business.\u201dYet it is precisely these adaptations that have allowed many Silicon Valley start-ups to stick it out \u2014 for now, at least.\u201cThe start-up world did heed the warnings,\u201d said Max Levchin, a former employee and a founder of PayPal and the chief executive of Affirm, a lending start-up in San Francisco.For techies who have been grappling with the not-yet-a-crash environment, the adjustment in their outlook is evident in their speech. Entrepreneurs who once talked about how fast their start-ups were growing are now spouting from a bible of fiscal responsibility.Sean Behr, the chief executive of the parking service Zirx, epitomizes the change. The company, named after the Ukrainian word for star, was in the \u201con-demand\u201d space, providing valet parking with the touch of a smartphone button. Mr. Behr said his goal was to make all of Zirx\u2019s consumers feel like stars.But each customer was so expensive to acquire and serve that Zirx lost money and consumers in all six cities where it operated. By late last year, Zirx, a San Francisco start-up that had raised $36 million, had only about a year\u2019s worth of cash left.So in January, Mr. Behr, 41, walked his employees through nearly 40 PowerPoint slides detailing the company\u2019s precarious finances and explained that Zirx needed to take drastic actions. That month, he told customers Zirx was shutting down its on-demand businesses where valets would park cars for any customer who asked and would instead focus on more lucrative corporate clients.\u201cInvestors used to say grow, grow, grow and don\u2019t worry about costs,\u201d Mr. Behr said. \u201cNow you\u2019re encouraged to not run out of money and make sure you\u2019ll be around.\u201dToday, Zirx is profitable in eight of its nine markets, he said. The company has preserved $10 million from its last financing round to keep in the bank for a rainier day.At Bannerman, a 16-person security guard start-up based in San Francisco, Johnny Chin, the chief executive, also narrowed the company\u2019s focus after warnings of a crash. While the start-up once pursued several types of customers, it began concentrating on serving only medium-size offices and property managers.The company was losing money last year, but it is now profitable. Start-ups \u201cstarted to cut their most frivolous spending,\u201d said Mr. Chin, 30. \u201cPeople are just cautious. It\u2019s healthier.\u201dOther entrepreneurs have a newfound air of practicality, no longer shooting for their companies to be the next tech behemoth like Facebook.Ken Denman, chief executive of the artificial intelligence start-up Emotient, was trying to drum up more money for his company last year when he heard the talk about a coming start-up calamity. So to hedge his bets, he started talking to potential buyers, too.\u201cIn 2013, I wouldn\u2019t have thought about selling,\u201d said Mr. Denman, 58. But all the concerns \u201cencouraged folks to behave in whatever way would give them the greatest chance to succeed.\u201dIn January, he sold his four-year-old company for an undisclosed amount to Apple, where most of his team now works. \u201cI looked at all the variables and wanted to do what was the best thing for the employees and the company,\u201d said Mr. Denman, who is taking a break after the sale.While there has been no crash since then, he does not regret any prognostications. He said he was glad if young companies had stopped overspending because of his warnings.\u201cFunding for just anything under the sun has gone away,\u201d Mr. Gurley said. \u201cI spoke out because the longer those things go on, the worse things end up later on.

{"Headline": "\u2018The Birth of a Nation,\u2019 Nate Parker\u2019s Heralded Film, Is Now Cloaked in Controversy", "Date": "2016-08-17", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 It was supposed to be a corrective to #OscarsSoWhite. The blistering story of a slave revolt that was directed and written by a black artist, Nate Parker, who also stars in the lead role, \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d had been positioned as a balm for an industry long criticized for sidelining minorities.Instead, the film has become clouded by the disclosure of tragic details in a nearly two-decade-old case in which Mr. Parker was accused \u2014 and later acquitted \u2014 of raping a fellow student while at Penn State. The episode was already known, including by the studio backing the film, but on Tuesday Variety gave it new life by revealing that Mr. Parker\u2019s accuser committed suicide in 2012 at the age of 30.And the controversy may worsen: As more people will discover when they see the film, which is scheduled to open on Oct. 7 in more than 1,500 theaters, Mr. Parker\u2019s script uses gang rape as a central story point, though the attack is not explicitly shown. The film looks at the slave revolt Turner led in Virginia in 1831, but a storytelling device \u2014 the brutal assault by white men on Turner\u2019s wife \u2014 feeds a rage that sets the rebellion in motion.Members of Mr. Parker\u2019s team of Hollywood advisers also privately worried on Wednesday that additional details about the 1999 case, including that his accuser was white, could emerge as new flash points.Until now, \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d has been the leading Oscar contender. Discussing awards may seem in poor taste, especially in light of the rape case, but it is impossible to separate the Oscars from Mr. Parker\u2019s film. Four longtime awards strategists, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the supercharged nature of the controversy, said in interviews that \u2014 at least as things stood on Wednesday \u2014 \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d was gravely damaged as an awards prospect.Fox Searchlight has repeatedly said over the years that it does not make distribution decisions based on awards potential, but traction on the Oscar circuit, and the free publicity it brings, can nonetheless mean the difference between a financial hit and a miss. To justify the price it paid for the film, Searchlight must sell at least $50 million in tickets, box office analysts say. A Searchlight spokeswoman declined to comment on Wednesday, directing a reporter to a statement released on Friday. \u201cWe stand behind Nate and are proud to help bring this important and powerful story to the screen,\u201d the statement read in part, taking care to note Mr. Parker\u2019s acquittal.Three people working on the film\u2019s release, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the nature of the controversy, insisted that Searchlight had no plans to back away from its release plan, which would have Mr. Parker touring colleges and churches in the coming month.These people said that they had no evidence, so far, to suggest that the firestorm surrounding Mr. Parker had been lit through whispers by competing studios, as sometimes is the case in Hollywood. The woman\u2019s family sounded less convinced in a statement to The New York Times on Tuesday, which read in part, \u201cWe are dubious of the underlying motivations that bring this to present light after 17 years.\u201dMr. Parker\u2019s Facebook message, posted on Tuesday night, only appeared to inflame the situation. It was flooded with more than 500 responses, mostly from women and mostly harshly critical after learning of details about the case.Some called to boycott the film. \u201cI refuse to give you my money,\u201d wrote one Facebook user, Brynne Walker. Others condemned Mr. Parker, but said they would still support the movie. \u201cThe story needs to be told and seen,\u201d Imani Jackson Rosario wrote. \u201cBut what you did to that girl is horrible.\u201dMr. Parker and his roommate, Jean McGianni Celestin (who shares a story credit on \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d), were brought to trial in 2001. In testimony, the woman said that in August 1999 she passed out at Mr. Parker\u2019s apartment after a night of drinking \u2014 they had had consensual oral sex the day before \u2014 and awoke intermittently to find first Mr. Parker having intercourse with her, and then Mr. Celestin\u2019s penis in her mouth. The next day, she testified: \u201cI was in too much pain. I couldn\u2019t walk.\u201d In written statements read in court, both Mr. Parker and Mr. Celestin said that the young woman was lucid and consenting throughout the encounter.A friend of the two men, Tamerlane Kangas, who was visiting them the night of the incident, testified that Mr. Parker beckoned for Mr. Kangas and Mr. Celestin to join him with the woman in sex. After Mr. Celestin did, Mr. Kangas watched them switch positions with her \u2014 Mr. Kangas testified that he did not see her move \u2014 and left.The woman also claimed that she was repeatedly harassed after filing charges, and sued Penn State for failing to protect her. The case was settled for $17,500. Mr. Parker was acquitted of the charges, but Mr. Celestin was convicted of sexual assault, though that verdict was later overturned.Both Mr. Parker and the woman came from strikingly similar and largely unpromising backgrounds. Mr. Parker\u2019s father died when he was 11, and he grew up in a housing project in Norfolk, Va. \u2014 \u201crats and cinder blocks,\u201d he said in an interview on Saturday. He won a full wrestling scholarship for Penn State, though after the rape case he transferred to the University of Oklahoma.The woman\u2019s father left the family when she was 11, and at 15, according to court records, she and two of her three siblings were removed from her mother and placed in foster care. She did well in high school, skipping 11th grade and winning a scholarship. A sister, Sharon Loeffler, said that landing at Penn State had given her a chance at a future, though she had bouts of depression before the rape case. She dropped out of school a few months later, according to the lawsuit she filed against Penn State, and said the harassment that followed her filing charges prompted two suicide attempts.The revelations about her suicide spurred anguished and angry responses from several black writers, with many saying that Mr. Parker\u2019s initial responses to the case \u2014 noting his acquittal in 2001 \u2014 came off as sorely lacking.It is unclear whether Searchlight knew about Mr. Parker\u2019s past when it made its bid. \u201cUnder pressure at a film festival to close a highly competitive deal that was consummated in a day of heated negotiation, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not uppermost on a company\u2019s mind,\u201d Eamonn Bowles, president of Magnolia Pictures, an independent film company, said in an email.\u201c\u2018The Birth of a Nation\u2019 scenario is an extreme rarity,\u201d he added. \u201cA company tries to prepare itself for possible scenarios, but you can\u2019t cover everything.\u201dAn article on Thursday about controversy surrounding the coming film \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d after the disclosure of new details about a nearly two-decade-old case in which the film\u2019s director, writer and star, Nate Parker, was charged with rape misstated, in some editions, the year he was acquitted. It was 15 years ago \u2014 not 17 years ago, which was when he was initially charged, in 1999.Advertisement"}

Apple\u2019s new suite of operating systems appears to replace its pistol emoji, which was an image of a six-shooter, with a squirt gun.Apple\u2019s change is ill considered because it breaks the conceptual compatibility that Unicode is meant to establish. Anyone with an iPhone ought to be able to send a message to someone with another company\u2019s products \u2014 like Google or Microsoft or Samsung \u2014 and have what\u2019s delivered communicate the same idea as what\u2019s sent. But with this change, a squirt gun sent from an iPhone will turn into a handgun when received by an Android device, and vice versa.Those behind the campaign to remove the gun from the phone do not appear to be relying on arguments about kids\u2019, or everyone else\u2019s, malleability. Rather, they have portrayed it as a traditional grass-roots messaging campaign: \u201cBy removing the gun emoji,\u201d they write, \u201cwe\u2019ll show America wants stricter access to real guns.\u201d Apple is surely free to favor gun control as a matter of corporate policy \u2014 but it should not be tinkering with our right to express either that or a contrary view on worldwide platforms.It need not be this way. Rather, our devices already enable tech-savvy individuals to invent new emoji-like graphics to send their friends \u2014 and that their friends in turn can pass on to others. Those that attain extensive use could then be standardized in a routine way through Unicode and made available to everyone.Apple, Microsoft, Google and other \u201cbig tech\u201d companies should not be placed in a position, which they themselves do not want, of having to decide which words or emojis do and don\u2019t represent their brand.

{"Headline": "My Daughter the Pole", "Date": "2016-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe British vote to leave the European Union has had many consequences, among them a plunge in sterling, sagging business confidence, an identity crisis in Britain\u2019s two main political parties, confusion and uncertainty. One of its less-known results is that my daughter Adele is now contemplating becoming a Pole.\u201cDad,\u201d she said to me the other night over dinner in Brooklyn, \u201cif Britain starts up this Article 50 thing, I\u2019m going to get Polish citizenship.\u201d Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty lays out how a country quits the European Union. Because it is in a muddle over what to do, the British government has not yet triggered this procedure. But it almost certainly will.On the face of it, Adele\u2019s choice is a curious one. The Nazis gassed her maternal great-grandmother Frimeta Gelband in Poland. Adele\u2019s grandmother Amalia Gelband, aged 11 in 1942, found herself alone in Nazi-occupied Poland, a Jewish girl hounded. She changed her name to Helena Kowalska, passed herself off as a Catholic, found work on a farm, and survived Germany\u2019s attempted annihilation of European Jewry.After the war, Polish authorities stuck Amalia in a Jewish orphanage in Krakow, where she remained for three years. All she wanted of Poland was to get out of it. Her mother, her cousins, aunts and uncles had all been slaughtered.Amalia Baranek, her married name, is now a Brazilian citizen living in Rio. She has been celebrating the wondrous Olympics that have just ended. She has little time for denigrators of Brazil, the country that took her in. She has been living in Rio since 1948, the year she was at last reunited with her father, who had left Poland shortly before the war. There is no prouder Brazilian than Amalia. She knows a country whose spirit is generous.Adele, who is 18 and a sophomore at the University of Southern California, adores her Brazilian grandmother. Still, she\u2019s ready to become a Pole.I am not sure whom to blame for this, or whether blame is the right word (see below). The world was full of fear and anger in the 1930s, enough to propel a hatemonger to power in Germany. It is full of fear and anger again today, enough to propel Britain out of the European Union and a man as flawed as Donald Trump to the brink of the American presidency.The troubled psyche requires a scapegoat. For Hitler, it was the Jews, among others. Today scapegoats are sought everywhere for the widespread feeling that something is amiss: that jobs are being lost; that precariousness has replaced security; that incomes are stagnant or falling; that politicians have been bought; that the bankers behind the 2008 meltdown got off unscathed; that immigrants are free riders; that inequality is out of control; that tax systems are skewed; that terrorists are everywhere.These scapegoats, on either side of the Atlantic, include Syrian refugees, African migrants, Polish workers in Britain, Mexicans, Muslims and, now that it\u2019s open season for hatred, just about anyone deemed \u201cforeign.\u201dThere is not much new under the sun. As Rudyard Kipling observed: \u201cAll good people agree, / And all good people say, / All nice people, like Us, are We / And everyone else is They.\u201dAfter the madness against \u201ceveryone else\u201d comes remorse. The descendants of families murdered in or driven out of Poland during the Holocaust are now eligible to apply for ancestral citizenship. Some of Adele\u2019s close relatives have already become Poles.Of course, a Polish passport today is also a passport to work anywhere in the European Union, the greatest political creation of the second half of the 20th century, a borderless union of half a billion people (at least until Britain leaves). Young people \u2014 including all the young Britons who voted overwhelmingly to remain \u2014 want to live, love and work anywhere in Europe they choose.Adele is one of them. She loves London, where she completed high school. She loves its openness. She cannot believe her British passport may soon \u2014 unless sanity is somehow restored \u2014 no longer be a European Union passport. And so Poland beckons, just as Germany, with a similar law, has beckoned since Brexit for some British Jews of German origin. History comes full circle.In a way, this doubling back is right. Adele owes her existence to a brave Pole named Mieczys\u0142aw Kasprzyk, who in 1942 risked his life to hide Amalia in the attic of his family\u2019s farmhouse near Krakow. He knew the Gelband family, had been outraged by the killing of Jews and wondered in disbelief, as he once said to me, \u201cHow can you not help, if a child asks?\u201dKasprzyk told me something else: \u201cSomeone who does not know the difference between good and evil is worth nothing. In fact, such a person belongs in a mental institution.\u201dPlenty of Poles collaborated, but some did not. May Kasprzyk\u2019s moral clarity inspire Adele, as a Pole or not, and may the world never again descend into the darkness he felt bound to resist.An earlier version of this column misspelled the first name of a Pole who risked his life to hide Amalia in his family\u2019s farmhouse. He is Mieczys\u0142aw Kasprzyk, not Miecyslaw.Advertisement"}

He also views it as a potential marketing tool that can be used by artists and promoters to target their most engaged listeners by tracking the data that users submit about how many concerts they have attended and where.As a promoter, Mr. Shapiro said, he does not know whether people who have liked an artist\u2019s Facebook page are likely ticket buyers, but those who say they have bought tickets are a safer bet. \u201cIf I knew who those fans were, that\u2019s a game changer,\u201d he said.Last year, he and a partner, Madison House, promoted the surviving members of the Grateful Dead in a series of concerts called \u201cFare Thee Well\u201d in Chicago and Santa Clara, Calif., that sold $52 million in tickets, making the event an enormous success. (By comparison, the two weekends of Coachella, with dozens of bands, sold $84 million in tickets that year.)Mr. Shapiro was quick to acknowledge the challenges that Fans.com faces against gigantic social networks like Facebook, which has 1.7 billion users around the world. Mr. McNamee, who helped found Elevation Partners and was an early investor in Facebook, was no less candid, but said that for Fans.com to succeed, it only had to focus on the needs of music enthusiasts.\u201cIt need not be like Twitter or Facebook to please everyone involved,\u201d Mr. McNamee said. \u201cIt only needs to make the lives of fans better. And that is something that Peter Shapiro can do.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated one source of investment in Fans.com. The investors include Peter Shapiro\u2019s company, Dayglo Ventures, but not Mr. Shapiro personally. An earlier version of a photo caption with this article misspelled the name of a music festival.

{"Headline": "Do Your Friends Actually Like You?", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisTHINK of all the people with whom you interact during the course of a day, week, month and year. The many souls with whom you might exchange a greeting or give a warm embrace; engage in chitchat or have a deeper conversation. All those who, by some accident of fate, inhabit your world. And then ask yourself who among them are your friends \u2014 your true friends. Recent research indicates that only about half of perceived friendships are mutual. That is, someone you think is your friend might not be so keen on you. Or, vice versa, as when someone you feel you hardly know claims you as a bestie.It\u2019s a startling finding that has prompted much discussion among psychologists, neuroscientists, organizational behavior experts, sociologists and philosophers. Some blame human beings\u2019 basic optimism, if not egocentrism, for the disconnect between perceived and actual friendships. Others point to a misunderstanding of the very notion of friendship in an age when \u201cfriend\u201d is used as a verb, and social inclusion and exclusion are as easy as a swipe or a tap on a smartphone screen. It\u2019s a concern because the authenticity of one\u2019s relationships has an enormous impact on one\u2019s health and well-being.The study analyzed friendship ties among 84 subjects (ages 23 to 38) in a business management class by asking them to rank one another on a five-point continuum of closeness from \u201cI don\u2019t know this person\u201d to \u201cOne of my best friends.\u201d The feelings were mutual 53 percent of the time while the expectation of reciprocity was pegged at 94 percent. This is consistent with data from several other friendship studies conducted over the past decade, encompassing more than 92,000 subjects, in which the reciprocity rates ranged from 34 percent to 53 percent.Mr. Pentland said it could be that \u201cthe possibility of nonreciprocal friendship challenges one\u2019s self-image.\u201d But the problem may have more to do with confusion over what friendship is. Ask people to define friendship \u2014 even researchers like Mr. Pentland who study it \u2014 and you\u2019ll get an uncomfortable silence followed by \u201cer\u201d or \u201cum.\u201dIt is not a means to obtain higher status, wangle an invitation to someone\u2019s vacation home or simply escape your own boredom. Rather, Mr. Nehamas said, friendship is more like beauty or art, which kindles something deep within us and is \u201cappreciated for its own sake.\u201d\u201cTreating friends like investments or commodities is anathema to the whole idea of friendship,\u201d said Ronald Sharp, a professor of English at Vassar College, who teaches a course on the literature of friendship. \u201cIt\u2019s not about what someone can do for you, it\u2019s who and what the two of you become in each other\u2019s presence.\u201dBy his definition, friends are people you take the time to understand and allow to understand you.\u201cThere is a limited amount of time and emotional capital we can distribute, so we only have five slots for the most intense type of relationship,\u201d Mr. Dunbar said. \u201cPeople may say they have more than five but you can be pretty sure they are not high-quality friendships.\u201dIn the presence of a true friend, Dr. Banks said, the smart or modulating aspect of the vagus nerve is what makes us feel at ease rather than on guard as when we are with a stranger or someone judgmental. It\u2019s what enables us to feel O.K. about exposing the soft underbelly of our psyche and helps us stay engaged and present in times of conflict. Lacking authentic friendships, the smart vagus nerve is not exercised. It loses tone and one\u2019s anxiety remains high, making abiding, deep connections difficult.So it\u2019s worth identifying who among the many people you encounter in your life are truly friends. Who makes time for you? Whose company enlivens, enriches and maybe even humbles you? Whom would you miss? Who would miss you? While there is no easy or agreed upon definition, what friendships have in common is that they shape us and create other dimensions through which to see the world. This can be for better or worse depending on whom we choose as friends. As the saying goes, \u201cShow me your friends and I will show you who you are.\u201dKate Murphy is a journalist in Houston who writes frequently for The New York Times.Advertisement"}

But Ms. Dombek isn\u2019t just a Cassandra. She\u2019s also here to help, with nearly 140 pages of sharply argued, knottily intelligent, darkly funny cultural criticism and, if that doesn\u2019t work, the blunter instrument of a nine-point diagnostic test.Do you worry you are surrounded by fake, empty people who are trying to manipulate you? Do you believe you should associate only with others with \u201chigh empathy scores\u201d? Do you require \u201cexcessive reassurance\u201d that other people, especially when encountered online, are real?If so, you may have narciphobia.In \u201cThe Selfishness of Others,\u201d her first book, she stretches out, showing how a specialized clinical term metastasized into a sweeping description of our entire culture, and a weapon of intergenerational and romantic warfare.Ms. Dombek doesn\u2019t deny that pathological narcissism is real, and can be dangerous. But expanding the diagnosis from mass killers who \u201cpost on Facebook before they walk into schools and movie theaters with guns\u201d to run-of-the-mill \u201cbad boyfriends\u201d and young people in general, she argues, blinds us to how our own craving for esteem and attention works.\u201cThis story about how some people are,\u201d she writes, \u201cunder the surface is also a story about the way that we all want.\u201dAny book, for its writer, \u201cis its own asylum,\u201d Ms. Dombek laments, \u201cbut a book about narcissism is like the padded cell inside the asylum.\u201d Here, she bangs her head against psychoanalytic theory, reality television, Greek mythology, online self-help culture and social psychology survey methodology, among other subjects, until the reader sees often-illuminating stars.One of the book\u2019s most entertaining sections riffs on the dark continent of online self-help that Ms. Dombek calls \u201cthe narcisphere,\u201d where victims of relationships with narcissists help one another parse \u201cnarc\u201d behaviors like \u201clove bombing,\u201d \u201cmirroring\u201d and \u201cdoing a discard,\u201d which sometimes come disguised as perfectly normal actions. (\u201cMy narc in-law removed the family pictures from the hallway, and replaced a living room chair with a piano,\u201d one poster says. \u201cI just can\u2019t figure out why she would do this.\u201d)She also checks in on the \u201cmanosphere,\u201d as she calls the parallel universe of sites where \u201cseduction strategies meet paleo diets,\u201d and men trade advice on how to outmaneuver the kind of needy, manipulative women who are likely to label them narcissists. But it doesn\u2019t, by her lights, stand a chance.\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing a girl with a bad boyfriend has,\u201d she writes, \u201cit\u2019s the moral upper hand in the religion of mental health.\u201dCalling out narcissism, she notes, wasn\u2019t always primarily a female sport. For Sigmund Freud, the archetypal narcissist was a woman, particularly a beautiful woman, locked in immature \u201cself-contentment and inaccessibility.\u201d Other psychologists extended his theories, giving rise to the common notion of the narcissist as wearing \u201ca charming mask covering a cold calculator, a self empty of empathy and the capacity to love.\u201dToday, pop psychology has given us a wealth of subtypes, including the Phallic Narcissist, the Corporate Narcissist, the Organizational Narcissist, the Medical Narcissist, and the Spiritual Narcissist. (Do you try to act generously, publicly align yourself with noble causes and \u201ctalk a lot about care and empathy\u201d? You may be a Communal Narcissist.)\u201cOnly one person can be the center of another person\u2019s world at any given time, and ideally, this would always be you,\u201d Ms. Dombek writes, before slipping in the shiv: \u201cThis is where all the narcissistic romance websites invite you to be: in the center of the world, stuck in time, assessing the moral status of others, until love is gone.\u201dThat may sound awfully judgmental. But Ms. Dombek, despite her efforts to keep the first-person pronoun at bay (\u201cI don\u2019t want you to find me self-absorbed,\u201d she writes early on), is also offering an earnest recovery narrative of sorts.Before the book ends, her bad-ish boyfriend \u2014 or \u201cromantic affiliate,\u201d as he prefers it \u2014 has morphed into a good boyfriend, or at least a partner no more self-preoccupied, she realizes, than she is. She breaks free not from him, but from the compulsion to obsess over whether he is a narcissist, clearing space to consider bigger questions, like the relationship between the cigarette butt she unthinkingly \u2014 a passing stranger might say narcissistically \u2014 flicks onto the sidewalk and impending climate catastrophe.A stretch? Perhaps. But it\u2019s worth pausing over one slyly double-edged item on Ms. Dombek\u2019s narciphobia checklist. Are you \u201cpreoccupied with fantasies that the world is ending because of the selfishness of others\u201d? Maybe we all are. And maybe sometimes the fantasy is real.The Selfishness of OthersAn Essay on the Fear of NarcissismBy Kristin Dombek150 pages. Farrar, Straus and Giroux. $13.00. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Homeless Find Refuge in Forests, \u2018Anger Is Palpable\u2019 in Nearby Towns", "Date": "2016-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEDERLAND, Colo. \u2014 Gerald Babbitt lives in these woods, in a pop-up trailer on cinder blocks that he bought for $250. His toilet is a bucket, and when he and his wife need to refill their water jugs, they drive their creaky green Jeep a mile down the mountain and into town. Most people are kind, but the other day someone called them \u201chomeless vagrant beggars,\u201d Mr. Babbitt said.\u201cYes, we\u2019re homeless,\u201d he said, sitting in the shade of his camper here in the Arapaho National Forest. \u201cNo, we\u2019re not vagrants. No, we\u2019re not beggars. We just barely are making it. What you see is by the grace of God.\u201dTo millions of adventurers and campers, America\u2019s national forests are a boundless backyard for hiking trips, rafting, hunting and mountain biking. But for thousands of homeless people and hard-up wanderers, they have become a retreat of last resort.Some residents have begun taking photographs of hitchhikers or videotaping confrontations with homeless people camping in the woods and posting them online, including on a private Facebook page created recently called Peak to Peak Forest Watch. Some say the campers have cursed at them for driving past without picking them up, or yelled at them while they were cycling or hiking. They say they no longer feel comfortable in some parts of the woods.But as a homeless man named Julian, 30, hiked down from the hills and into Nederland one rainy afternoon, guitar and knapsack slung on his back, he said a passing driver yelled at him to get out of town. He said he, too, felt uncomfortable and was heading toward Estes Park, Colo., then on to Oregon. He did not give his last name because he said he did not want friends and family reading that he was homeless.Mr. Wendlandt serves lunch and hands out socks to needy campers every Thursday. But he has stopped provisioning people with blankets and sleeping bags, worried that what seemed like compassion could be exacerbating a problem.One smoldering cigarette or lightning strike can ignite an entire hillside in the parched, fuel-filled forests across the West, and officials say the campfire galloped away and burned 600 acres of canyons and forests around Nederland. It destroyed eight homes, including that of a fire captain.The two men who started the campfire, Jimmy Suggs and Zackary Kuykendall, were arrested and charged with fourth-degree arson. The day before their arrest on July 10, the two men and a female companion \u2014 who was not criminally charged \u2014 happened across a reporter for The Boulder Daily Camera who was interviewing evacuees from the still-burning fire.Citing the fire danger, some residents have asked the Forest Service to do what many cities have done in cracking down on the homeless: impose tighter rules on camping, or ban it in parts of the woods that have attracted the most people.The Forest Service says it is working with thin law enforcement resources. One officer is assigned to Boulder County, which encompasses Nederland and the Roosevelt and Arapaho National Forests, which dominate the western part of the county. The service is spending more and more of its budget fighting wildfires, and has pared back on filling some law enforcement posts, said Chris Boehm, the agency\u2019s acting deputy director for law enforcement and investigations.\u201cThere may be some regions where we have one officer assigned to an entire forest or area,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what we want, but fires are expensive.\u201dFor years, people searching for solitude or without better options have retreated to live in the woods, in buses, vans, tents or other improvised shelters, their numbers swelling every summer and dwindling when the snow comes. But officials say public lands researchers are just beginning to study who lives there, and why.A 2015 survey of 290 law enforcement officers for the Forest Service found that officers in the Rocky Mountain West and Southwest encountered long-term campers most often. About half of the officers said the number of these long-term campers was on the rise, and only 2 percent said it had declined. (The rest said the number had either largely held steady or fluctuated.)Lee Cerveny, one of the researchers who conducted the survey, said it was unclear how many people might be living on public lands at any given time.\u201cWhat is happening, and why are we seeing more people living in the forests?\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet.\u201dNational parks place strict limits on camping, but in national forests and open spaces managed by the Bureau of Land Management, people can pitch tents just about anywhere camping is not prohibited. Many forests allow camping for only two weeks at a time. In 2015, the Forest Service handled 1,014 episodes related to violations of those rules.Around Nederland, crime reports, medical emergencies, unattended fires and other calls for help and extra patrols have soared at three Forest Service areas popular with homeless campers. The Boulder County Sheriff\u2019s Office was called there 388 times last year, up from 213 in 2013, and officials attribute some of the rise to Colorado\u2019s reputation as a mecca for legal marijuana, and Nederland\u2019s embrace of retail marijuana dispensaries.Rick Dirr, the Nederland fire chief, said his largely volunteer firefighters no longer answer nighttime calls in the woods without a marshal or sheriff\u2019s officer as backup. He said he has faced down one camper who carried a butcher knife, and searched the woods for another man who had attacked his girlfriend. There was the boy who swallowed a heroin baggie, he recalled, and a man who was hit in the head with a shovel.Others just do not understand how the forest works, he said. He responded to a report of an illegal fire to find a teenage boy and his 8-year-old sister alone at their campsite, bags of garbage everywhere. They and their parents had been living out of their car, and the father asked Chief Dirr when someone would come by for garbage pickup.\u201cWe still don\u2019t have a solution,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are the things going on unseen in the woods.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When the Shop Looks a Lot Like Home", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySign of the TimesAs shopping online from the comfort of your home continues its unchecked expansion \u2014 almost $100 billion in online sales in the first quarter of 2016 \u2014 in-store shopping is turning increasingly homey. Beyond the physical space, note the proliferation of amenities that soften the pecuniary nature of the retail experience: At one end of the spectrum, a cup holder on the handlebar of your grocery-store cart; at the other end, silver platters of chilled San Pellegrino at the ready. And since nothing kills the domestic vibe like a wait at the checkout line, the final transaction that punctuates a purchase is currently being remodeled. In a luxury boutique, your credit card is now likely to be whisked away \u2014 the grubby reality of commerce happens out of sight \u2014 only to be discreetly, and somewhat apologetically, returned in a supple leather binder or on a zebrawood tray. In the more democratic Apple store, the exchange is decentralized: Scan your purchase on your phone, then waltz out of the store unassailed. It\u2019s like everything is yours already.While we may, in pursuit of a bargain, suffer the cacophony of Century 21 or allow Ikea to swallow us whole and squeeze us through its labyrinthine intestine, the relationship between the big commercial store and the luxury object is fraught. That ultra-precious handbag tends to hemorrhage aura when set in context of innumerable clones. When luxury goods are offered in a simulated domestic setting, the brutal impersonality of mass production and merchandising is disguised behind the fantasy of exclusivity. Intimacy equals desirability.There was a time when bigness was in. Big meant choice. Big meant entertainment. Big meant the whole world in a box. Malls touted square footage as the metric of shopping exhilaration. Macy\u2019s Herald Square billed itself as the \u201cworld\u2019s largest store.\u201d In the early decades of the last century, shoppers entered the fabled Wanamaker\u2019s department store in Philadelphia through a towering Corinthian portico to browse in a great Roman-Doric court, a fantastical Egyptian hall, and Byzantine, Empire and Art Nouveau period rooms. Merchandise from across the globe was displayed with exhibitions of Old Master paintings and exotic objets d\u2019art. The grand department store was a portal to the world, the commercial twin of the great encyclopedic civic museums, where uplifting and educating the masses was serious business.At the same time, Sears, Roebuck & Co. and Montgomery Ward were delivering bigness to the rural masses through the original home shopping network: consolidated mail-order catalogs, some over 700 pages, that offered everything from button-hooks and brassieres to motor buggies, delivered directly to their customer\u2019s doorstep via the U.S.P.S. An early Sears catalog cover, boasting \u201cOur trade reaches around the world,\u201d featured a fair-skinned maiden, addressed envelope in hand, floating over a bucolic American farmstead astride a cornucopia spilling furniture, guns, pianos and clothing. The mail-order catalog provided nationwide domestic access to a previously unimaginable selection of products. Inventory was king.By the \u201960s, Sears alone reportedly accounted for almost 1 percent of the U.S. gross national product, employed 350,000 people and provided credit cards to over half the population. (The hippie-domestic Whole Earth Catalog was launched as that era\u2019s proto-Brooklyn, D.I.Y. alternative \u2014 the original Etsy.) Fast-forward to the now-familiar narrative of the exurban big-box revolution. Walmart became the world\u2019s largest retailer and QVC and Home Shopping Network began to deliver 24/7 in-home access to cubic zirconium, spot remover and miracle knife sets to anyone with a television and telephone.And then something came along that was bigger than all that came before it, with the real potential to access the whole earth, and everything changed. The internet made shopping the world not only a reality but an essential feature of everyday life for millions of people. Enter global shopping with a hyperlocal interface: as local as your own couch. Amazon has out-bigged the biggest big box \u2014 adding 17 million square feet of warehouse space just last year \u2014 and in achieving such massive scale, fomented the expectation that anything you could possibly need is always in stock, immediately available and just a keystroke away.Now even the keystroke has been disrupted. With the recent innovation of Amazon Dash buttons \u2014 branded clickers that automatically place an order for a specific product \u2014 the home is the interface and the pantry has been outsourced. Out of Tide? Just hit the button on the Dash device, and that familiar orange box will appear on your doorstep in a matter of minutes by way of a friendly union-free drone. As it is estimated that the average American woman uses a mere fraction of her wardrobe and wears a new purchase only a handful of times, that logic of linked distribution will almost certainly spread to your closet. It may be only a matter of time before we have a Chanel Dash button, a Calvin Dash button. Winter clothes storage in the summer? Forget it. Out of style? Just send it back. Same with sizing. Your wardrobe will follow your climate, your body and your mood. All that warehouse space is an extension of your own personal space.As our shelves and closets are sensored for automatic fulfillment, and our pantries communicate directly with the public larders to keep them perpetually brimming with the bounty of American plenty, there will be ever less reason to leave the comfortable confines of our homes. The comprehensive sites such as Amazon and Zappos, and the curated ones like Net-a-Porter and Yoox, provide our great database of commodities. As product research and price comparison are relocated from physical spaces to virtual ones \u2014 it\u2019s called a browser for a reason \u2014 the function of stores shifts from a site of discovery and transaction to something else ... what, exactly, is at the moment hotly contested.Bigness, at least in terms of luxury, seems to be a dwindling proposition. Discovery and selection in the physical world can never match the reach of the internet with its huge-scale aggregators, branded e-commerce shops, curatorial shopping sites, and the long trail of small boutiques and Etsy home-crafters offering anything and everything. What the shop can offer, however, are things difficult to achieve online: an intimate relationship with things, a haptic appreciation of materiality, a personal interaction with a sympathetic helper, an experience that contextualizes objects, a place to socialize with like-minded connoisseurs and, most importantly, a respite from the avalanche of too much stuff. Consider that the much-vaunted Apple store, which has the highest profit per-square-foot of any store in the United States, essentially offers variants of four products: telephone, watch, music player and laptop. In an ironic reversal, stores now may have to offer less to stay relevant.If we\u2019ve become used to, and adept at, shopping from bed, and as our homes are increasingly conjoined to distant warehouses that monitor their status, shops themselves may become extensions of the social function of our domestic space. As simple fulfillment of household commodities becomes automated, browsing, research and cost comparison become the prelude to shopping, not its raison d\u2019\u00eatre. A visit to the store may revert back to John Wanamaker\u2019s original dream: shopping as a form of education and cultural edification. Maybe we learn best in the places that we feel most comfortable in: places that feel like our own living room, only nicer.Oh, and whatever happened to Wanamaker\u2019s? In Manhattan, the gargantuan old department store now houses a corporate headquarters ... for Facebook.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Disability Means", "Date": "2016-08-25", "News": "Supported byDisabilityI was diagnosed with a degenerative disability early in life, but appeared able-bodied and mostly \u201cfit in\u201d \u2014 physically, at least. As an adult, I became a wheelchair user, and the world changed around me. It took me a long time to find my tribe and acknowledge my disability identity \u2014 I now proudly identify as crip, and fight for the rights of my fellow crips.It surprised me how sitting down and using a mobility aid changed the way others viewed me. I\u2019d gone from being a well regarded professional to a marginalized and oppressed member of a minority group. When my workplace refused to build an accessible toilet, I had few options available to me, and my doctor told me to change my tampon in my office, with the door locked. People looked at me differently, as though I was not one of them \u2014 they jumped out of my way or apologized to me in shopping centers, even when they were well out of range. My experience as a non-walking person could not have been more different from my experience as a biped, even when I was on crutches.There was no place for me to find out about crip pride, about disability identity \u2014 no cultural spaces, no parades or events. We\u2019ve started creating \u201ccrip cultural spaces\u201d in Australia, with zines and radical self-love cards. It\u2019s how we make change, when we realize that the social model of disability makes sense and that mobilizing our forces is the only way we will cure oppression and marginalization. I\u2019m proud to be part of a rock star community of activists in my country.One assumption is that we are looking for sympathy. Wrong. Take your pity, sympathy and the inspiration you get from our \u201cbrave fight\u201d someplace else.Another theme is that we are trying game the S.S.D.I. system. Please. As others have pointed out, getting through that process is hardly a walk in the park, and after that you may get a whopping $1,200 a month, MAX (which is taxable income BTW). Try living in any urban area that is likely to have the infrastructure that makes living with a disability tolerable on the money you get from S.S.D.I. Please.Growing up, I was one of the only visibly disabled people in my public grade school and high school. Since my friends were all abled, as is my family, I never considered \u201cdisabled\u201d as an identity. Thanks to the annual M.D.A. telethons, I thought disability was something to be ashamed of, or a weakness \u2014 that everyone with a disability wanted to be fixed, and that wasn\u2019t me at all. I loved who I was, and had pride in my identity even if I didn\u2019t recognize it in that way.Social media and the internet changed things for me. I was able to connect with other disabled individuals and see how they felt about their identity. In college, I read every book I could on feminism, which led me to books and articles on the disability rights movement. I found communities online where there were heated and engaging conversations about what it means to have a disability in a world that isn\u2019t built with us in mind. That\u2019s when I proudly labeled myself disabled.There are certain symptoms of my disabilities that I have difficulty navigating: the pain, the anxiety, and breathing problems. But would I change who I am \u2014 would I take away my disability? No. Being disabled is too linked to my humanity, to my empathy, and my strength. It dictates my relationships with others. What I\u2019ve experienced in life is a story worth telling, and a road worth following, despite how society tries to tell us otherwise. I would proudly live this life again if I could.I would say that, if we\u2019re thinking specifically about psychiatric disabilities, there is no \u201cpride movement\u201d because of the shame and stigma that still exist around psychiatric illnesses (and other disabilities). I mean, who wants to be visible when so many still think of depression/bipolar as character flaws and when illnesses like schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder are so pathologized, even criminalized?A funny thing happened to me in the grocery store last week. I\u2019m quadriplegic and, at best, about 4\u2019 7\u201d in my chair; I loathe asking for help in getting things from the top shelf in the store. While checking out some fresh corn, a blue-haired woman, about 4\u2019 2\u201d offered to hand me the low corn if I\u2019d hand her the high corn. Perspective is a funny thing.First, I feel a tremendous pull to start by mentioning how refreshing to see this being talked about (even more so, being talked about in The New York Times).I\u2019m a 29-year-old who was once given a life expectancy of 13. Fifty-three surgeries, countless long-term hospital and rehabilitation stays have been the \u201cnorm\u201d in my life. I often discuss with my partner the disconnect between my queer and disabled identities. How I seem to have developed a sense of pride in being queer, but often reject any identity pertaining to disability. I\u2019ve begun to try to weave the two together and noticed that when doing so, I\u2019m more comfortable introducing disability into queer spaces, than I am introducing queerness into disability-related spaces. The two feel contradictory, but inside I know they shouldn\u2019t. What I do know, or at least believe to be true, is that disability remains invisible and/or hard for able-bodied people to look at, because unlike racial, cultural, or sexual identities, it is an identity that any able-bodied person could possibly face. And let\u2019s be honest, that\u2019s scary. Most identities are set in stone. You are heterosexual or you are not. You are a person of color or you are not. Disability is something that can happen to any person at any time \u2014 and that\u2019s a reality that\u2019s hard to face. It\u2019s hard to face when you are disabled, why wouldn\u2019t it be hard to face when you are able-bodied and aware that you could become disabled?I am so grateful for this being talked about. I think visibility is always productive. I think taking pride in ourselves, our abilities, and our resilience is impossible without it.Thank you for a pleasant morning read, to both the author, and The New York Times.As a divorced, working mother struggling with multiple sclerosis, I\u2019d never seek to find pride in the label \u201cdisabled.\u201d Maybe it is just me, but I already feel proud that I am able to drag (sometimes literally) myself out of bed and provide for myself and my children. Watching my children flourish is all the adulation I need. I don\u2019t feel the need to draw additional attention to my \u201cdisability.\u201d Most days, I just want to feel \u201cnormal.\u201d But, maybe that\u2019s just me.I have been a wheelchair user since I broke my neck in a fall and sustained a spinal cord injury in 1976 at the age of 18. In the months following my accident in the rehab hospital, while I struggled to adjust, I also met some truly good people learning how to survive with a spinal cord injury, and I learned from them. After I got out of rehab, I just tried to get on with my life, going back to college, learning how to drive a car with hand controls, etc. But I mostly avoided making any close connections with other people with disabilities. You could say I was in denial about being disabled, and all of its ramifications. Then, I was very fortunate to have been introduced to the disability rights movement in the early 1980s, working at an independent living center. Learning how to be a strong advocate for the rights of people with disabilities eventually became a career. Learning about the various forms of ableism and discrimination faced by my friends and colleagues with disabilities, and how to effectively fight this oppression, ultimately has changed my life. A lot has changed over the past 40 years, both for me and for many of the 56 million Americans with disabilities. The passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990 was truly a milestone, and has led to great improvements in accessibility and opportunity for things that many nondisabled people take for granted: education, employment, housing, and transportation, just to name a few. But many people with disabilities still face rampant discrimination and misunderstanding. I will not stop working until ableism is eradicated.The gay pride movement of the \u201880s was full of able-bodied young men, many of them with good jobs. They had leisure and strength to make a social movement.Disabled people tend to be, how shall I say, *disabled.* Some are chronically ill, which doesn\u2019t lend itself to sustained activism. Some have other types of limitations which prevent regular work, which also chops up sustained activism. Most disabled people are poor, because disability in this country is criminally expensive.Why aren\u2019t they making a pride movement, in other words? Maybe getting by day to day is more important. Living. Surviving. Avoiding more pain, living within what are often narrow physical, mental, and financial constraints.Other people will have to be heavily involved in any such movement. And that\u2019s the problem.Nervous. That\u2019s how people act when they learn that I\u2019m legally blind. They hear the word \u201cdisabled,\u201d and, suddenly, they become anxious. They start speaking cautiously, as though they\u2019re worried they\u2019ll offend me, or that, somehow, I won\u2019t understand them. This is most apparent with my teachers. Back in high school, and even now in college, my teachers acted super antsy around me. They constantly asked me if I was O.K.; if I got what was happening. The reason for this was that they\u2019d never met a disabled person before, and therefore didn\u2019t know how to act around me. See, to them, disabled kids were the ones who got hidden away in \u201cspecial\u201d classrooms. They were the unfortunate and embarrassing mistakes that needed to be swept under the rug. What my teachers, and every ignorant, uninformed person who thinks this way, don\u2019t seem to understand is, even with a disability, I am still very much a person. I am capable of loving, laughing, crying and learning. I have a full range of emotions and beliefs, and am perfectly capable of thinking for myself. All I need are a few accommodations, and, as long as I get them, there\u2019s no problem, or reason to discuss my condition. I tried to prove this to people by getting perfect grades, acting in theater productions, and joining tons of clubs. But that never seemed to make any difference. I was still, first and foremost, \u201cthe blind kid.\u201d And, to be perfectly honest, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be anything but \u201cthe blind kid\u201d to other people until we start changing the narrative; the narrative that persons with disabilities are defined solely by their disability; that their disability somehow diminishes their personhood. Yes, physical and mental disabilities are and can be very serious. But there\u2019s a substantial difference between acknowledging that someone needs a little bit of help, and making them out as sad, sorry pitiful creatures who need to be hidden from \u201cnormal\u201d people. And the sooner we stop doing that, the less nervous everyone will be.I have an unusual disability, I\u2019m anosmic. After my olfactory meningioma tumor was removed, I lost my sense of smell. While I would say that as disabilities go, this one is not too hard to live with, it\u2019s amazing how many people tell me \u201cit\u2019s nothing\u201d or even \u201cyou are lucky.\u201d It took me two years to get over the shock of the loss of my olfactory window on the universe. Eating, playing or just taking a walk down the street after a spring rain are not the same, not to mention losing the unique smell of my loved ones. Odors are emotional, which is why we are uncomfortable talking about them. Enjoy those smells, the nasty with the nice, you don\u2019t know how lucky you are.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Officials Spent Big on Olympics, but Rio Natives Are Paying the Price", "Date": "2016-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySports of The TimesRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 A thousand metaphysical miles from the well-heeled Olympic zone, a couple of activists and I entered the Favela do Mandela, a ramshackle collection of brick-and-tar-paper buildings. We walked a narrow road ringed by wary-eyed young men, which led to a narrower one, which led to a five-foot-wide alleyway. We found the home of 64-year-old Marie Auxiliadora.With blond hair brushed back, she was a diminutive eruption of joy. She apologized for her modest home, scrubbed and packed with crucifixes and plastic flowers and pastel curtains. She wore a sun dress and pink flip-flops. Although morning gunfire had earlier forced her to hide in her bedroom, she insisted hers had been a good life. She noted she had four beautiful adult children, thank God. On her television, we watched demonstrators protest the presence of the Olympic torch on the day before the Olympics started.She pursed her lips and put her hands over her chest.\u201cI am so upset,\u201d she said. Her eyes turned red-rimmed. \u201cI have not gotten my retirement check for a month. Our hospitals and schools are broken. Shooting every day, and they spend all of our money on this Olympics.\u201cThe rich play, and we die.\u201dSeen from the northern and western precincts of Rio de Janeiro, which sprawl inland from the green Tijuca forest and the coastal mountain spine, the Olympics inhabit a foreign and wealthy world.In two days of wandering through favelas and working-class neighborhoods, I found Olympic excitement an often extinguished fire. Graffiti and signs draped across walls by labor activists document the Games\u2019 huge cost to a wounded city. Olympic torchbearers jogged into several working-class neighborhoods and left sprinting, chased by angry residents. Outrage is not difficult to understand.Billionaire developers and media magnates have made a fortune off the Olympics; bribe and corruption investigations arising from these Games are a growth industry, with construction companies and hundreds of congressional deputies potentially in the dock. An extremely expensive subway was built to run the length of this city\u2019s well-to-do south coast from Copacabana to the Olympic site. A forest of towers to house athletes rose on publicly owned land; afterward, the developer will turn these into luxury housing. On the route from the international airport to the south shore, Olympic organizers put up colorful walls so that visitors could not see the favelas.The International Olympic Committee\u2019s chieftain, Thomas Bach, proclaimed the Rio Games a grand success last week. I wondered at the quality of his eyes.To write of pain is to take nothing from the Brazilians, who are gracious hosts and exuberant fans, crowding the waterfront of Copacabana for beach volleyball. Grand athletic achievement is inspiring, and these athletes, the world\u2019s greatest, deserve applause. But the practiced I.O.C. shakedown of cities, the demands that local officials compete to construct obscenely expensive stadiums and news media centers and to guarantee that tourist zones have been swept of the desperate, has rarely looked more problematic.Rio is all but bankrupt. Teachers have gone months without pay. Retirees are months behind on pension checks. University professors gather to mop floors and empty overflowing garbage cans.I talked to a hospital administrator in a northern neighborhood who asked that I not use his name for fear he might lose his job. Officials had instructed him, he said, to reserve beds in overcrowded wards and to put aside hard-to-obtain medicines, such as blood pressure pills, for Olympic tourists. His hospital received a new ambulance to serve the Olympics.I traveled this day in the company of Anderson Franca, a sturdy, bearded activist, writer and researcher, and his wife, Suelen Masiero. Anderson sees a bill of lading for decades of neglect come due.\u201cIn a way, the Olympics are to be congratulated,\u201d he says. \u201cThe contradictions of this city are emerging faster and more dramatically.\u201dLater, we will put the question of the Olympics to Geovane Prince, a muscular, tattooed photographer in the Mandela favela. He has created a thriving studio and travels about the city. He shakes his head before I get the question out.\u201cAll the corruption, the suffering, there is too much pain,\u201d he says. \u201cWe protest. To keep building giant arenas in the wealthy zone? We are sick of investing in this.\u201dViolence is a caldron still boiling and cannot be separated from this Olympic antipathy. In advance of the 2014 World Cup and now the Olympics, the police and the military pushed at the point of semiautomatic rifles and armored cars into hundreds of favelas in brutal pacification campaigns. Homicides dropped significantly but spiked again this year. New York City recorded 350 murders in 2015. Rio de Janeiro, a state with roughly double the population of New York City, recorded 461 murders in April 2016 alone.At 8:30 a.m. last week, we traveled toward the Complexo do Alem\u00e3o favela, which sprawls across four hills. We stopped at a traffic light. Crack-pop, crack-pop. I tilted my head; it sounded like firecrackers, except not really. The driver in the car next to ours rolled his eyes. The paramilitaries and drug gangs, he said through his open window, shoot early this morning.\u201cYou see that hill?\u201d Franca, the activist and my guide this day, said as he pointed toward a green mountain ridge. Tumbledown homes climbed its slopes; azure skies rose above. Those were the Mercy Hills. \u201cThey found a mass grave with dozens of bodies. No names.\u201dI talked later to a woman who owned a modest grocery store on another hillside in this favela. She cradled her baby granddaughter. \u201cNo one can even get together to watch a game,\u201d she said. \u201cThe occupation is too dangerous.\u201dHers was an often repeated observation. Residents want peace, but they harbor no particular rooting interest in the army or the drug gangs or the paramilitaries composed of retired cops: All armies are lethal.We scrambled up a hardscrabble path to the new police precinct that commands the hill like a medieval castle keep. Inside, three police officers in body armor nodded warily.They pointed to one, two, three bullet holes in the glass windows of the precinct, each the size of a Ping-Pong ball; the police attack, and the gangs counterattack. The precinct wall is dominated by a painting of a knight kneeling and holding his sword, accompanied by these words: \u201cYou may die, but if you don\u2019t fight, you\u2019re already dead.\u201dThe precinct commander walked in, a semiautomatic rifle strapped to his chest. \u201cYou should not stay here \u2014 go back to the Olympics,\u201d he said. \u201cShooting is anytime.\u201dOfficials cut several bus lines that run north to south during the Olympics, in hope of keeping gangs from invading the tourist zones of Copacabana and Ipanema and the central business district. Many tens of thousands of working-class Cariocas, as natives of Rio are known, spend two and a half to three hours commuting to distant jobs, journeys made far more arduous during the Games. Anderson\u2019s mother lives in a favela. She is in her ninth decade and has never visited the white sand beaches of Copacabana and Ipanema.The next day, I talked with Carla Maria Avesani, a young professor at the Rio de Janeiro state university. She has a Ph.D. and runs a nutrition institute at the University of Rio de Janeiro. She serves on the board of a prestigious journal and writes for an international audience of academics. She studies how changes in diet help poor patients on dialysis and those with heart problems. It was her dream to work at a public university with a mission.Now she and her fellow professors pool their Brazilian reais to buy computers and paper towels, and to fix doors. They try to figure out what to do about the broken elevator. Their university is broke, its pockets turned out.She lives in an upper-middle-class neighborhood, with good restaurants and that Mediterranean climate. The evening atmosphere, with young couples hand in hand, calls to mind Rome, except with enormous rock faces nearby and an ocean lapping at your feet. She watched the opening ceremony, all the brilliant choreographies, and read her friends\u2019 proud posts on Facebook.She could not join them.\u201cIt was a beautiful party; we Brazilians do wonderful parties,\u201d Avesani said. \u201cBut to see the amount of money spent for stupid stadiums, I don\u2019t want to celebrate when the state is broke and hospitals are closing and the poor are dying by the thousands.\u201dShe paused. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see so many foreigners, and I want you to be happy. I want to be happy.\u201dShe sighed. \u201cI would be happiest now if the world sees how we are living. I feel absolutely offended by these Olympics.\u201dEmail: powellm@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China, Not Silicon Valley, Is Cutting Edge in Mobile Tech", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "Supported byAll of these developments have something in common: The technology was first popularized in China.Silicon Valley has long been the world\u2019s tech capital: It birthed social networking and iPhones and spread those tech products across the globe. The rap on China has been that it always followed in the Valley\u2019s footsteps as government censorship abetted the rise of local versions of Google, YouTube and Twitter.But China\u2019s tech industry \u2014 particularly its mobile businesses \u2014 has in some ways pulled ahead of the United States. Some Western tech companies, even the behemoths, are turning to Chinese firms for ideas.\u201cWe just see China as further ahead,\u201d said Ted Livingston, the founder of Kik, which is headquartered in Waterloo, Ontario.The shift suggests that China could have a greater say in the global tech industry\u2019s direction. Already in China, more people use their mobile devices to pay their bills, order services, watch videos and find dates than anywhere else in the world. Mobile payments in the country last year surpassed those in the United States. By some estimates, loans from a new breed of informal online banks called peer-to-peer lenders did too.The future of online payments and engagements can be found at Liu Zheng\u2019s noodle shop in central Beijing. Liu Xiu\u2019e, 60, and her neighbor, Zhang Lixin, 55, read about the noodle shop on WeChat. Then they ordered and paid for their lunches and took and posted selfies of themselves outside the restaurant, all using the same app.Liu Zheng, who is not related to Liu Xiu\u2019e, said the automated ordering and payments meant he could cut down on wages for waiters. \u201cIn the future, we will only need one waiter to help in the restaurant and one to help with seating,\u201d Mr. Liu said.Before Venmo became the app for millennials to transfer money in the United States, both young and old in China were investing, reimbursing each other, paying bills,and buying products from stores with smartphone-based digital wallets.\u201cQuite frankly, the trope that China copies the U.S. hasn\u2019t been true for years, and in mobile it\u2019s the opposite: The U.S. often copies China,\u201d said Ben Thompson, the founder of the tech research firm Stratechery. \u201cFor the Facebook Messenger app, for example, the best way to understand their road map is to look at WeChat.\u201dA Facebook spokesman declined to comment. Tencent did not respond to requests for comment.Executives from companies like Facebook and smaller rivals like Kik are trying to replicate what has emerged in China: dominant online platforms where users will spend much of their time. Much of that effort is focused on chat.\u201cThe cool thing about chat is it becomes an operating system for your daily life,\u201d Mr. Livingston said. \u201cGoing up to a vending machine, ordering food, getting a cab: Chat can power those interactions, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing with WeChat.\u201dThe biggest advantage for China\u2019s tech industry, according to many analysts, is that it was able to fill a vacuum after the country essentially created much of its economy from scratch following the end of the Cultural Revolution, in 1976. Unlike in the United States, where banks and retailers already have strong holds on customers, China\u2019s state-run lenders are inefficient, and retailers never expanded broadly enough to serve a fast-growing middle class.Many Chinese also never bought a personal computer, meaning smartphones are the primary \u2014 and often first \u2014 computing device for the more than 600 million who have them in China.\u201cThe U.S. was first to credit cards, and everyone there has a personal computer. But China, where everyone is on their phones all the time, is now ahead in mobile commerce and mobile payments by virtue of leapfrogging the PC and credit cards,\u201d Mr. Thompson said.Chinese companies also approach the internet in a different way. In the United States, tech firms emphasize simplicity in their apps. But in China, its three major internet companies \u2014 Alibaba, Baidu and the WeChat parent Tencent \u2014 compete to create a single app with as many functions as they can stuff into it.On Alibaba\u2019s Taobao shopping app, people can also buy groceries, buy credits for online games, scan coupons and find deals at stores nearby. Baidu\u2019s mapping app lets users order an Uber, reserve a restaurant or hotel, order in food, buy movie tickets and find just about any type of store nearby.Tencent has opened up WeChat to other companies, allowing them to create apps within WeChat. Ebaoyang \u2014 a start-up that enables people to order oil changes for their cars directly on smartphones \u2014 was at first almost totally reliant on WeChat to attract business. Gao Feng, one of Ebaoyang\u2019s founders, said the company still relied on the app for 50 percent of its payments and 20 percent of new customers.\u201cWe started from WeChat. So it was our main, original source for getting customers,\u201d he said.Between fees for its services and money it makes through online games, WeChat manages to generate $7 in revenue per user each year, according to Nomura. The app has roughly 700 million users, more than the total number of smartphone users in China, in part because some users are outside the country and in part because people have multiple accounts.Much of that comes not from ads, as it might in the United States, but from spending on games, services and goods sold on the app. Those models may not translate from one market to the other, but the two can still borrow from each other, said Carmen Chang, a partner at the venture capital firm New Enterprise Associates.\u201cChina was able to develop a lot of innovative business models, which arose in a different kind of economy,\u201d said Ms. Chang, who spends time in both China and in Menlo Park, Calif. \u201cWhether or not we admit it here in Silicon Valley, it\u2019s had an impact on us and our thinking.\u201dCao Li in Beijing contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Daily Report: More Clean Energy, Brought to You by the Cloud", "Date": "2016-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsThe cloud, as it turns out, may have a very green lining.A prime reason for this is the growing demand from its cloud computing centers, where Apple keeps its customers\u2019 music, photos and much more.On this front, Apple joins a number of other cloud providers, who collectively may change the face of energy production by increasing demand for renewable energy.Big cloud-computing companies are building facilities on an unparalleled scale, and at a time when few others are increasing demand. Dominion Virginia Power, which supplies perhaps the world\u2019s greatest concentration of data centers, reported that overall demand rose 1 percent last year, but demand from data centers rose 9 percent.Amazon Web Services has since committed to obtaining 100 percent of its power from renewable sources. Last year the company purchased a 250,000-panel, 80-megawatt plant in Virginia, which it later sold to Dominion.Other data centers have long been situated near big dams, which provide cheap as well as green power. Lots of building is happening in Iowa, Texas and elsewhere in America\u2019s great wind corridor, to encourage the construction of more wind-driven facilities.Remote locations have other benefits. \u201cWhen your nearest neighbor is 100 acres away, you don\u2019t get as many complaints about the power lines,\u201d said Joe Kava, who heads Google\u2019s data center operations.There are signs it is affecting the way utilities plan future construction. American Electric Power, which operates in 11 states, has said it will add 6,300 megawatts of new wind power and 3,100 megawatts of new solar generation before 2033. An AEP official told me that much of this was attributable to demand from data centers.For many of these companies, it\u2019s not just about saving the planet; power has moved from an incidental cost to a main determinant of profitability. Like nothing else, that has affected the operation of data centers in ways that may improve other big companies\u2019 power consumption.The traditional measure of data center efficiency is power usage effectiveness, or P.U.E. This measures how much power goes into a data center and how much of that is used by computing equipment. For a poorly run center, this number can be 2.0 or higher, meaning it takes two watts of power to put one watt into a computer.Together, these companies are building with their clouds a new kind of industrial infrastructure. It would be something if it also reshaped our power usage for the better.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Celebrity Z-List? Yes, It Exists", "Date": "2016-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic's NotebookMeet the striving celebrity underclass that has risen to dominate the gossip machine. Aspiring models, third-tier reality show stars, impossible-to-place actors, YouTube vloggers and viral news subjects can now all curry coverage just by replenishing their social media accounts with photos of their babies, their butts or both. These are people you\u2019ve probably never heard of \u2014 or have a nagging suspicion you might have, but don\u2019t quite know why.It used to be that the only way a non-recognizable person could land in the pages of the glossy celebrity magazines was to lose 100 pounds, serve as some heartwarming testimony to good-old-fashioned American values, or be murdered. But in the early aughts, the magazines started diversifying their coverage of Hollywood\u2019s leading Jens and Bens with stories on the romantic dupes and plastic surgery nightmares of reality television. Now, as the rise of social media demolishes the leverage that celebrity tabloids once had over their most famous subjects, the gossip industry keeps defining celebrity downward. (After all, no magazine can match the reach of Taylor Swift\u2019s more than 90 million Instagram fans or Kim Kardashian West\u2019s 47 million Twitter followers.)On a recent episode, they take on Brittany Farrar, the ex-girlfriend of Aaron Rodgers\u2019s little brother, Jordan Rodgers (who is now dating the \u201cBachelorette\u201d star JoJo Fletcher), who recently accused Jordan of cheating in a series of Instagram posts. \u201cWhy are we still hearing about her?\u201d Ms. Weber asked. Mr. Finger replied: \u201cBecause she wants us \u2014 she did her due diligence in making sure we talked about her.\u201d And just like that: A Who was born.Time Inc. has started a kind of general-interest publication on the internet-famous just as the internet has atomized celebrity into a zillion tiny fandoms. Few people are typically energized by the generic category of \u201csocial media figure.\u201d They get their kicks by closely following a select few of their favorite stars, the stars\u2019 friends and family, and a network of (often infighting) fans. The obsessive monitoring of all these channels drums up sufficient drama to create an enduring story line, even if only a few thousand people can manage to follow along. Plus, the setup provides fans the illusion of power in determining which Whos become Thems (Blac Chyna, a rap video vixen engaged to Rob Kardashian, is on her way toward top-level recognition) and which seem destined to fade into permanent obscurity (I\u2019m sorry, Sarah Wright Olsen).But these modern fandoms produce grist for non-fans, too. There\u2019s something deliciously surreal about monitoring the online movements of the barely famous, a class of people who are just unpolished, desperate and savvy enough to act mad, sloppy and sexy. The fact that publications like People and Us Weekly are covering it with a straight face adds another absurd layer.Besides, these people are assaulting our social feeds every day whether we like it or not. Outlets like The Shade Room and \u201cWho? Weekly\u201d have managed to extract bits of hilarity, delight and shame out of that arid media landscape.

Though many diseases can cause dementia, Alzheimer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accounts for 60 percent to 80 percent of dementia cases, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich is why you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll often hear the terms used interchangeably,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heather Snyder, the senior director of medical and scientific operations for the Alzheimer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Association. She said the question comes up frequently because patients may receive an initial diagnosis of dementia followed by an evaluation that yields the more specific diagnosis of Alzheimer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease, and they may be confused.The second most common form of dementia is vascular dementia, which is caused by a stroke or poor blood flow to the brain. Other diseases that can lead to dementia include Huntington\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease, Parkinson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Some patients may have more than one form of dementia.Dementia is caused by damage to brain cells. In the case of Alzheimer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease, that damage is characterized by telltale protein fragments or plaques that accumulate in the space between nerve cells and twisted tangles of another protein that build up inside cells. In Alzheimer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease, dementia gets progressively worse to the point where patients cannot carry out daily activities and cannot speak, respond to their environment, swallow or walk. Although some treatments may temporarily ease symptoms, the downward progression of disease continues and it is not curable.But some forms of dementia are reversible, which is why it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to be evaluated by a physician early on. Vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, brain tumors, depression, excessive alcohol use, medication side effects and certain infectious diseases can cause reversible forms of dementia.Another treatable form of dementia is a condition known as normal pressure hydrocephalus, which is caused by a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain that can be relieved by surgically implanting a shunt to drain off excess fluid. This type of dementia is often preceded or accompanied by difficulty walking and incontinence.

{"Headline": "Attack at University in Kabul Shatters a Sense of Freedom", "Date": "2016-08-25", "News": "Supported byBeyond providing a quality education, the school offered a glimpse of a carefree life away from the unpredictable violence that afflicted the rest of the capital. Behind layers of security, students could play basketball at the gym, compete in debate tournaments or just have an uninterrupted conversation over coffee.Men with Kalashnikov rifles and grenades first gunned down a guard at the adjoining school for the blind. One drove a car packed with explosives into the American University\u2019s wall, blowing a gap through it. Two more militants dashed onto campus, where hundreds of students were taking evening classes. The attackers methodically stalked the men and women trapped inside, fighting off the Afghan security forces for nearly 10 hours in a terrifying overnight siege.On Thursday morning, at least 13 lay dead: seven students, three police officers, two university guards and the night guard at the neighboring school for the blind. Abdul Baseer Mujahid, a spokesman for the Kabul police, said that more than 30 others were hurt in the attack; another estimate, from the Health Ministry, said 16 had been killed and 53 wounded.The attack was unmistakably a blow to young Afghans who had chosen to defy the migrant exodus away from the country\u2019s war and instead pursue their dreams in the difficult circumstances at home.From its start in 2006, the American University drew the sons and daughters of prominent Afghan families. But many students of more humble backgrounds won scholarships, and they were among the school\u2019s most promising.On Thursday, President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack as a barbaric act of enmity against progress. Out of safety concerns, the university remained closed.All three of the attackers were killed, their affiliation still unannounced by Thursday evening. But another statement from Mr. Ghani\u2019s office suggested that suspicion had fallen on the Haqqani wing of the Taliban, or some other Pakistan-based faction. Mr. Ghani called the Pakistani Army chief, Gen. Raheel Sharif, and \u201casked for serious and practical measures against the terrorists organizing the attack,\u201d the statement said.Through the night, family members of the people trapped on campus gathered outside a security cordon, hoping for news. Some students inside took to social media to ask for help, but they later fell silent \u2014 many of them desperate to avoid alerting the gunmen to their hiding places.Members of the Afghan Special Forces cut off the area\u2019s electricity and began evacuating hundreds of students, moving slowly to try to avoid civilian casualties, said Sediq Sediqqi, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry.Security officials said both of the infiltrating gunmen entered the Bayat classroom building just after 7 p.m., when about 160 students were in class in the building. One of the militants had stationed himself near the stairs on the first floor, while the second had moved up to target the classrooms on the second floor. Most of the student casualties were caused by the first militant, who shot those trying to flee.The militant on the first floor was killed around 1:30 a.m., officials said. The gunman on the second floor lobbed grenades at Special Forces troops for two more hours. The siege was declared over shortly before 5 a.m. on Thursday.Some of the people who had been trapped inside the university described a 10-hour ordeal, much of it spent waiting for death in complete darkness. They hid in gym lockers, or under classroom desks. Some jumped from upper floors, breaking their legs, while others managed to scale the walls of the compound.Abdullah Frotan, a student who was trapped until the very end of the siege, said he had been in a third-floor classroom when the initial explosion occurred. About 10 students in his class tried to make it to the first floor to escape, but the gunmen were already inside the building, so they rushed back to the third floor and tried to hide in a classroom.\u201cWe were lying like dead bodies on the ground in the rear of the class, and we put all the chairs in front of us, and we hid behind the chairs,\u201d Mr. Frotan said.Two of his classmates were wounded, one in the back and one in the leg, Mr. Frotan said. They held their hands over their mouths to stifle cries of pain that could alert the attackers.\u201cOne of our classmates did not come back with us to the third floor. He was killed; we learned this later,\u201d Mr. Frotan said.Muhammad Daud, 26, an economics student, said he had recited his final prayers hiding under the tables on a third-floor classroom. The attacker fired a few rounds in the dark, and then moved on to the next room.Mr. Daud agonized over whether to try to jump out a window. The gunman\u2019s sudden return to the classroom made the decision easier. \u201cWhen he started firing, I jumped and didn\u2019t think what would happen,\u201d he said.Alnaz Jamal, an 18-year-old scholarship student who was starting her first week of college after years of displacement in Pakistan, did not make it.Ms. Jamal, whom her family called Alina, had been attending a lecture on the second floor, and she was among those who jumped, said Omaid Sharifi, a cousin. When the family finally found her body at a morgue this morning, they saw she had also sustained bullet wounds.Her father, a street vendor, was in Pakistan to get Ms. Jamal\u2019s high school transcript and new clothes for her university journey.\u201cHer mother faints every 15 minutes,\u201d Mr. Sharifi said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018He Wasn\u2019t Profiteering During the Conflict\u2019", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "Supported byHere are the top 10 comments of the week on our digital platforms, as selected by our readers and the journalists who moderate nearly every comment.His critical, recent acceptance speech was given articulately and without a hint of anxiety, public speaking being the most feared activity in American life, per most studies.So tell me what exactly are the authors trying to prove? A plastic surgeon didn\u2019t create the bone spurs, and the need for Wharton-trained American businessmen will likely never decline, during, after or before our foreign conflicts.He wasn\u2019t profiteering during the conflict \u2014 he was taking risks and creating jobs.A professional runner\u2019s sponsor is 99 percent of their income, as opposed to many other professional sports players that receive a team salary in addition to the money made through sponsorship and ensuing promotions of that brand.The brand that a professional track athlete wears is their backbone, their financial support, and many of these athletes are extremely grateful toward these companies for providing them with financial support as they compete in a sport with little prize money out there.The wearing of a brand is a give back from these athletes, who take pride in their sponsors, as a way to showcase these companies on such a major platform.I watched a top-ranked swimmer slip on the start and dive straight down into a 4-foot deep competition pool and hit his head so hard he was immediately knocked out and had a dislocated shoulder.Something as simple as compressing your knuckles as you drive your hand into the touch pad may require attention. Always need to expect the unexpected.Yes, these students may be a bit more radical than most \u2014 how many activists have you met who were not, in some way, radical? Yes, some of the nuance of the issues may also escape some of these students. But the cure for that is more speech, not less.Calling someone an anti-Semite, like calling someone a racist, shuts down debate and does not allow people with opposing views to better understand each other. Yet this article sets out to show the \u201cbad\u201d anti-Israel protesters (the ones who are loud, rude, and unapologetic) with the \u201cgood\u201d ones (the ones who politely discuss their differences). The fact is, some things are worth being loud about.I\u2019m liberal and a woman, but this trend to strip all history from our higher-learning institutions bugs the heck out of me. I\u2019m surprised they haven\u2019t removed the colorful Maryland state flag from campus since it\u2019s the heraldry of two slave-owning families that founded what became Maryland.The out-of-court sexism in the hallway etc. was much more obvious. One male state court judge would wink at me in court and asked me into his chambers to ask about my love life. Some of the state judges wouldn\u2019t let women wear pants in the courtroom.At my first couple of legal jobs at a firm and a district attorney\u2019s office, there was also a no-pants rule. I assume the men couldn\u2019t wear dresses to court, but they probably can now.The fact that young people are preferring this to suburbs I also find very encouraging. Surely there are some negatives, such as the \u201cdollar incentives\u201d required in Delaware, but overall I think this is a very positive trend.Our summer is short but used to the fullest. It\u2019s wonderful to see, but there are shortcomings: the noise, the litter, the lack of privacy. But it's fun and communal, so let\u2019s cheer this development. Everywhere. And let\u2019s invite the tourists with a warm heart.Retrogradation is referred to as \u201cstaling\u201d in the baking industry. The retrogradation of wheat starch in bread is responsible for staling.Consequently, if you want to maximize the useful life and quality of bread, don\u2019t store it in the refrigerator; put it in the freezer.I\u2019ve been storing fresh bread in the freezer ever since, and I\u2019ve never been disappointed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Social Security Now Requires Cellphone to Use Online Services", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Money AdviserPeople seeking to manage their federal Social Security benefits online can no longer do so unless they provide a cellphone number so they can receive an access code by text each time they log on.The change, which took effect July 30, is part of an effort to improve online security, according to the Social Security Administration. Users with online \u201cmySocialSecurity\u201d accounts already could choose to use texted codes as an extra layer of security, in addition to their user name and password. But now, the extra step is mandatory. Many businesses, including banks, offer such codes, but their use is typically optional.The agency said that it realized the new security layer might be an inconvenience for some people. But, it added, \u201cOur research shows that an overwhelming majority of American adults have cellphones and use them for texting.\u201dOther comments suggested that older Americans who do have cellphones avoid using the text function because they do not want to pay for receipt of spam messages.Some privacy advocates question whether texted codes are the best way to safeguard a user\u2019s information.\u201cIt\u2019s better than nothing,\u201d said Paul Stephens, director of policy and advocacy at the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, which focuses on protecting personal information and preventing identity theft.Mr. Stephens also faulted the Social Security Administration for giving users scant notice of the new requirement. Some people with online accounts received notification by email over the weekend, as the new rules were taking effect. While the change is well intended, \u201cI just think it was very poorly executed,\u201d he said.Technical glitches stymied some users who tried to use their accounts soon after the new text requirement took effect on Saturday. Verizon Wireless customers, for instance, could not use the system until Monday afternoon. Verizon\u2019s systems apparently were screening the text messages as spam, said Kevin King, a company spokesman, but that problem has been fixed.The website, however, noted on Wednesday that heavy traffic might cause problems with the receipt or entry of text codes and advised users, \u201cPlease check back in a few days.\u201dThe mySocialSecurity website, introduced in 2012, allows people who receive Social Security benefits to obtain verification letters, order replacement Social Security or Medicare cards and set up or change direct deposit of payments. Those who do not yet receive benefits can obtain estimates of future payments and check their annual earnings statement to make sure that their benefit payments are calculated using the correct information.Here are some questions and answers about the new Social Security log on system:Users enter their user name and password as usual, but they are also asked to enter an eight-digit code texted to their cellphone each time they log on to the website. A texted code is now also required for people who are establishing accounts for the first time. The codes are valid for 10 minutes and can be used just once.If you get a new phone but keep the same phone number, you do not have to do anything, according to the administration\u2019s website. If you lose your cellphone, you can request a cellphone reset code online, and the agency will mail you a letter with a reset code in five to 10 business days.Advertisement"}

For a while, its big nightclub, XL, drew a crowd. But its relative popularity was short-lived.The hotel tried to play up its gay-branding in certain special events and in its lobby art. Earlier this summer, the lobby walls were adorned with Barbie doll dioramas that depicted various dolls in same-sex situations: two male dolls walking hand-in-hand; two women \u2014 one in a white gown, another in a white sleeveless tuxedo \u2014 at their wedding.Ms. Ader spent a lot of time at the hotel, installing her art and looking in to witness reactions to it. \u201cIt was a very mixed group of tourists,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t necessarily a place for the gay community.\u201dThe necessity for a so-called gay hotel in the center of New York City was never entirely clear. \u201cGays travel a lot and for anyone who travels a lot, the hospitality industry goes out of its way to be very hospitable,\u201d said Nathan Lump, the editor in chief of Travel & Leisure and editorial director of Time Inc.\u2019s lifestyle group.He added: \u201cI have traveled with my husband in some countries that are not super gay-friendly. But when you check in to an international hotel, you know they are not going to treat you terribly when you ask for a king-sized bed. The industry as a whole is very inclusive.\u201d\u201cThe most interesting portion of the hotel is the interior courtyard,\u201d said Mr. Kamali, who has toured the space. \u201cHaving access to outdoor space in Manhattan that is off the street is incredibly unique,\u201d he said.Certainly, a nice spot for a summertime glass of ros\u00e9.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "My Daughter the Pole", "Date": "2016-08-22", "News": "Supported byThe British vote to leave the European Union has had many consequences, among them a plunge in sterling, sagging business confidence, an identity crisis in Britain\u2019s two main political parties, confusion and uncertainty. One of its less-known results is that my daughter Adele is now contemplating becoming a Pole.\u201cDad,\u201d she said to me the other night over dinner in Brooklyn, \u201cif Britain starts up this Article 50 thing, I\u2019m going to get Polish citizenship.\u201d Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty lays out how a country quits the European Union. Because it is in a muddle over what to do, the British government has not yet triggered this procedure. But it almost certainly will.On the face of it, Adele\u2019s choice is a curious one. The Nazis gassed her maternal great-grandmother Frimeta Gelband in Poland. Adele\u2019s grandmother Amalia Gelband, aged 11 in 1942, found herself alone in Nazi-occupied Poland, a Jewish girl hounded. She changed her name to Helena Kowalska, passed herself off as a Catholic, found work on a farm, and survived Germany\u2019s attempted annihilation of European Jewry.After the war, Polish authorities stuck Amalia in a Jewish orphanage in Krakow, where she remained for three years. All she wanted of Poland was to get out of it. Her mother, her cousins, aunts and uncles had all been slaughtered.Amalia Baranek, her married name, is now a Brazilian citizen living in Rio. She has been celebrating the wondrous Olympics that have just ended. She has little time for denigrators of Brazil, the country that took her in. She has been living in Rio since 1948, the year she was at last reunited with her father, who had left Poland shortly before the war. There is no prouder Brazilian than Amalia. She knows a country whose spirit is generous.Adele, who is 18 and a sophomore at the University of Southern California, adores her Brazilian grandmother. Still, she\u2019s ready to become a Pole.I am not sure whom to blame for this, or whether blame is the right word (see below). The world was full of fear and anger in the 1930s, enough to propel a hatemonger to power in Germany. It is full of fear and anger again today, enough to propel Britain out of the European Union and a man as flawed as Donald Trump to the brink of the American presidency.The troubled psyche requires a scapegoat. For Hitler, it was the Jews, among others. Today scapegoats are sought everywhere for the widespread feeling that something is amiss: that jobs are being lost; that precariousness has replaced security; that incomes are stagnant or falling; that politicians have been bought; that the bankers behind the 2008 meltdown got off unscathed; that immigrants are free riders; that inequality is out of control; that tax systems are skewed; that terrorists are everywhere.These scapegoats, on either side of the Atlantic, include Syrian refugees, African migrants, Polish workers in Britain, Mexicans, Muslims and, now that it\u2019s open season for hatred, just about anyone deemed \u201cforeign.\u201dThere is not much new under the sun. As Rudyard Kipling observed: \u201cAll good people agree, / And all good people say, / All nice people, like Us, are We / And everyone else is They.\u201dAfter the madness against \u201ceveryone else\u201d comes remorse. The descendants of families murdered in or driven out of Poland during the Holocaust are now eligible to apply for ancestral citizenship. Some of Adele\u2019s close relatives have already become Poles.Of course, a Polish passport today is also a passport to work anywhere in the European Union, the greatest political creation of the second half of the 20th century, a borderless union of half a billion people (at least until Britain leaves). Young people \u2014 including all the young Britons who voted overwhelmingly to remain \u2014 want to live, love and work anywhere in Europe they choose.Adele is one of them. She loves London, where she completed high school. She loves its openness. She cannot believe her British passport may soon \u2014 unless sanity is somehow restored \u2014 no longer be a European Union passport. And so Poland beckons, just as Germany, with a similar law, has beckoned since Brexit for some British Jews of German origin. History comes full circle.In a way, this doubling back is right. Adele owes her existence to a brave Pole named Mieczys\u0142aw Kasprzyk, who in 1942 risked his life to hide Amalia in the attic of his family\u2019s farmhouse near Krakow. He knew the Gelband family, had been outraged by the killing of Jews and wondered in disbelief, as he once said to me, \u201cHow can you not help, if a child asks?\u201dKasprzyk told me something else: \u201cSomeone who does not know the difference between good and evil is worth nothing. In fact, such a person belongs in a mental institution.\u201dPlenty of Poles collaborated, but some did not. May Kasprzyk\u2019s moral clarity inspire Adele, as a Pole or not, and may the world never again descend into the darkness he felt bound to resist.An earlier version of this column misspelled the first name of a Pole who risked his life to hide Amalia in his family\u2019s farmhouse. He is Mieczys\u0142aw Kasprzyk, not Miecyslaw.Advertisement"}

The reason it caused so much damage is that many of the beautiful ancient buildings are composed of unreinforced masonry (stone).These are the most dangerous buildings to be in during an earthquake as they have very little sheer strength, and therefore collapse when exposed to lateral ground accelerations. Such buildings can undergo seismic retrofitting, but the process is expensive and I suspect that most buildings in Italy have not undergone such a procedure.So therefore it is likely an unaddressed infrastructure issue that led to wide such spread devastation.We were fine, just broken dishes and books everywhere, but I remember the terror. I can\u2019t imagine how these people felt as their houses collapsed around them.My heart goes out to Italy. Know that many Americans who have lived through earthquakes themselves are thinking of you.We hope many are pulled from the rubble alive. And hopefully you can rebuild stronger.

By the time the bagels are boiled and baked, the lye has been completely neutralized and there should, in fact, be no free lye remaining.If you want to follow the recipe that uses lye, be careful (generally speaking, kitchens can be dangerous places if you aren\u2019t careful) but don\u2019t worry about having remnants of a toxic chemical in your food.On the one hand, you can speak with people about political matters in a way that would be far too awkward in person (\u201cno religion or politics\u201d is still the standard rule of etiquette for most social gatherings, I find).On the other, it means I now have to see how much my grandfather loves Trump.

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "That the show, and a corresponding book, \u201cPortraits,\u201d co-published in the United States by Yale University Press, includes exclusively portraits is a unique departure for Mr. Eggleston. He is known for his signature snapshots of ordinary objects printed in the vivid hues of the once-commercial dye-transfer process, an expensive color process by which prints are created by superimposing three layers of dye on a gelatin base. There has never been a museum show in his career dedicated to his portraiture. Despite the seemingly emotional content in the exhibit\u2019s works, Mr. Eggleston\u2019s claims of neutrality are unwavering and supported by the exhibit\u2019s curator, Phillip Prodger.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a widely accepted notion that in a great portrait, a spark is transmitted from sitter to camera to artist to viewer that lays bare a person\u2019s defining qualities and gives us special insight into who they are or were,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Prodger, who is also the head of photographs at the gallery. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSomehow in just one-sixtieth of a second, a lifetime of achievement, passion, loss, hope, fear and worry can somehow magically coalesce in a single frame. Eggleston rejects this approach.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn fact, Mr. Eggleston rejects that approach so much that, to him, just as a parking lot is no different from a person, so too is a portrait of a stranger no different from that of a family member. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor some reason I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never felt like photographing, to any extent, friends and family,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said in a May 2015 interview published in the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s catalog.Yet the exhibit is filled with pictures of family and friends, something explained away by Mr. Eggleston, who recently turned 77, as a random component of a trickle of photographs shot over the course of 50 years. Despite the photographer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supposedly democratic approach to all subjects, the images distinguish themselves. In one photo from 1971, his son, William Eggleston III, is asleep with his arm bent over a red blanket. The child, photographed from above, suggests an adult\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perspective and has an emotional warmth.  Compare this to the exhibit\u2019s cover photo of an unknown boy, presumably a young supermarket clerk. This photo (Slide 6), taken in Memphis in 1965, shows the boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s profile with his hand over some shopping carts, his shadow cast on the wall. The straight angle of the frame reveals a more removed stance than the photo of his son. Both portraits include information about their subjects.There are also photographs of celebrities like Dennis Hopper, Walter Hopps and Joe Strummer, who, Mr. Prodger maintains, are also approached with neutrality.\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo me there really isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a pronounced difference between the three, whether he was photographing his mother, Joe Strummer or the guy at the gas station pumping gas,\u201d Mr. Prodger said. The exhibition, in addition to displaying nonsignature work, also serves as an interesting study of a photographer who has long been identified with a specific technological advance. Mr. Eggleston, although not the first photographer to work in color, was among the first to have a major museum exhibition of color photographs at a time when almost no one, except amateur and commercial photographers, was using it. He has since been known for his vivid dye-transfer printing. However, as with many photographers of his time, his earliest photography was in black-and-white. Because most of those early photographs were portraits, these are also included in the exhibit. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the first part of the exhibition there are 35-millimeter, spy film, large-format, hand-held video, photo-booth prints, sketches and Polaroids,\u201d Mr. Prodger said.  Mr. Eggleston has lived in the South his entire life and grew up on a former cotton plantation in Tallahatchie County, Miss. At age 10, he experimented with a Brownie Hawkeye. But it was at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee in the late 1950s that he began to explore photography seriously. He continued his studies at Delta State College in Cleveland, Miss., and the University of Mississippi in Oxford.

{"Headline": "With N.F.L. Deal, Twitter Live-Streams Its Ambitions", "Date": "2016-08-14", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Last March, Twitter and Facebook, along with other tech companies, faced off over which of them would get the rights to live-stream National Football League games on Thursday nights.Twitter, in contrast, agreed to pay the N.F.L. around $10 million to stream 10 games and to sell only a portion of the ad inventory exclusively. Twitter, which is based in San Francisco, wanted the Thursday night games because of their popularity; each game drew an average of 13 million viewers last season.When Twitter streams its first N.F.L. game on Sept. 15, it will get to assess whether its vigorous pursuit will pay off \u2014 and whether live streaming can viably be a linchpin of its future.Since April, Twitter has signed a series of live-streaming deals, including with Wimbledon, CBS News, the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League and Pac-12 Networks. Twitter is also in discussions with other organizations, including Major League Soccer and the Professional Golfers Association, for similar agreements, according to people briefed on the talks.Facebook declined to comment on the N.F.L. talks. In a statement at the time, the N.F.L. commissioner, Roger Goodell, said Twitter \u201cis where live events unfold and is the right partner.\u201d Major League Soccer declined to comment on discussions with Twitter, and the P.G.A. did not respond to requests for comment.For Twitter, the bet on live streaming is crucial to turning itself into a mainstream internet destination after other efforts have failed. Live streaming could finally broaden Twitter\u2019s appeal, attracting an even wider audience. And perhaps more important, live events would be another way to sell video ads. If streaming football or basketball games on Twitter\u2019s mobile apps and on desktop computers, along with other platforms, draws viewers, the company could sell more video ads, which typically command a premium.Twitter has directed Mr. Noto, a former Goldman Sachs banker with deep ties to the sports media industry, to lead the charge on live streaming and has assigned an engineering team to create its streaming video player. Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, considers streaming a critical component of the company\u2019s focus on \u201clive\u201d experiences, along with Periscope, its app that allows smartphone users to live-stream video.To bolster the effort, Twitter is in talks with Apple to bring the Twitter app to Apple TV, which would potentially let millions of Apple TV users watch the streaming N.F.L. games, according to the two people briefed on the discussions.Apple and Twitter declined to comment.Yet even as Twitter increases its live-streaming efforts, so are many of its rivals. Snapchat and Facebook are working on deals with media companies to acquire live-streaming rights to sporting events and entertainment; Instagram is also experimenting with live products. All of the companies are fiercely competing for video advertising dollars, as marketers slowly begin to shift money to online video promotions and away from television ads.There are other hurdles to live streaming, especially from wary content providers who view the technology world with a dose of suspicion.Twitter\u2019s push on live streaming began in late 2014 when Dick Costolo, then the company\u2019s chief executive, called Mr. Noto to discuss how to better use content \u2014 video, text or photos \u2014 to bring people to its service. Over the next 18 months, senior executives at the company debated options. Some batted around the idea of buying Mic, a news website aimed at young audiences, according to a person briefed on the conversations. Others were bullish on video.Eventually, video won out. Mr. Noto said that introducing premium content like sports, politics and entertainment \u2014 the types of programming people often pay to see \u2014 would entice and retain more Twitter users.Even with competition from Snapchat and Facebook, Twitter has a foundation to attract more live-streaming deals. For years, Twitter forged relationships with networks and content owners through a program known as Amplify, in which Twitter worked with TV programmers to distribute short video clips that were preceded by ads sold by both Twitter and the content owners.Twitter is also emphasizing its younger audience as a reason for marketers to advertise on live events. About 72 percent of the social media service\u2019s user base is 18 to 34 years old, according to third-party data and company models, said two people who asked for anonymity because Twitter\u2019s internal metrics were confidential.That focus has in part enabled Twitter to land advertisers like Bank of America for the streaming N.F.L. games.\u201cTwitter really owns those moments that matter to everyone,\u201d said Lou Paskalis, senior vice president for enterprise media planning at Bank of America. \u201cAs a marketer, what we can do with the context that Twitter creates is to join that shared moment.\u201dMr. Noto cautioned that Twitter\u2019s live-streaming strategy was still not fully formed and was just one part of a multipronged plan to remake the company. If live streaming works out, the plan is to make the live videos more easily accessible on Twitter \u2014 whether through notifications in the main timeline or through a mobile tab in Twitter\u2019s app called Moments, said two people briefed on the company\u2019s product plans.But first comes the N.F.L. game next month between the New York Jets and the Buffalo Bills, which will be live-streamed from Buffalo.\u201cOur opportunity is to use these familiar platforms that people understand, like streaming video, as a window into seeing everything else we really have available,\u201d Mr. Noto said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Canadians Rescue 1,500 Americans Who Veered Off Course on Inflatable Rafts", "Date": "2016-08-24", "News": "Supported byFor years, participants in the Port Huron Float Down in Michigan have gathered by the hundreds in inflatable rafts, inner tubes and other devices to bob on the St. Clair River between Michigan and Canada for an eight-mile trip on a summer afternoon.Occasionally in the past, a misguided floater or two ended up on the Canadian side, landing in points east instead of south, after launching from a beach in Port Huron, Mich.Erik Kimball of Port Huron, a participant and a past organizer of a safety patrol for the event, said this was the most floaters to go astray and end up in Canada. He said that things started routinely at 1 p.m. with about 5,000 floaters but that winds began to pick up, to as much as 30 miles per hour by 4 p.m., sending more and more people drifting off course.The Canadian Coast Guard, with help from the Ontario Provincial Police, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Canadian Coast Guard Auxiliary and the Sarnia and Point Edward Fire Departments, helped the floaters as they headed toward Sarnia, said Carol Launderville, a spokeswoman for the Canadian Coast Guard.Canadians, befitting their reputation as polite and helpful, handled the unexpected guests with good cheer, Mr. Kimball said.\u201cThe Canadian people, bless their souls, handled it lightheartedly,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of smiling.

{"Headline": "Milwaukee\u2019s Divide Runs Right Through Me", "Date": "2016-08-20", "News": "Supported byEssayIn Milwaukee, I lived two lives. On the East Side was the liberal Catholic school I attended for nine years; on the North Side was everything else.On the North Side that shaped me, there was a resentment, a reflexive skepticism that it took me awhile to understand as a son of Nigerian immigrants. But with experience, I got it. The only white people I saw in my neighborhood staffed the library. Parents tried to teach their children, in the most visceral ways they could imagine, to stay out of trouble.Like most people, many black parents on the North Side passed these feelings to their children.The narrative was different on the East Side. There I saw a practiced obliviousness among parents and children that I also did not fully understand. There we hoped to be doctors and lawyers, or in my case, a journalist.On many days, I felt as if I were being shuttled between two different cities, two different worlds. The cloistered shell of liberalism to the east and the infectious anger of the streets to the north never intersected, never touched.In the East, the future was expected. It was a birthright, a source of frenetic energy.In the North, reckoning was expected. It was inevitable, a source of pride and loathing.No matter your defenses, it would surely come, and punish the hopes that lie outside your black body.Memories of my East Side life are soft, a flood of inconsequential smiles and vague encouragements offered by people living protected lives. I attended school with kids too young to hear about what I had already experienced.Memories of my North Side life are sharp, like the screwdriver in my back when I wouldn\u2019t let a boy \u201cborrow\u201d my bike. Like my mother\u2019s words after the thief\u2019s father pretended to call for him, then slammed the door because his son couldn\u2019t be bothered.My North Side memories are also hot, like the summer, when the balance of power tilts irrevocably toward the ones who spend the most time in the streets, with the largest alliances. When those boys became men, they\u2019d become crews. They\u2019d have run-ins with the ones a few blocks over, and someone might die for the pride that began here.Life on the North Side was what mattered TODAY. It was my brother and I walking down the middle of a vacant street with baseball bats, looking for the one who beat up our little brother because he won a basketball game, and that was important TODAY. It was preteen girls begging teenage boys to come through the side door of some garage, because those teenagers were so buff, and they could finally have him, and he could take them, because that\u2019s what mattered TODAY.It was when the police were called and your friend, who had a robber\u2019s gun in his mouth, had his complaint dismissed because he was probably a drug dealer, and then you sat at the door holding knives all night to protect his family. It\u2019s when the police tore apart an entire car in a search, because the passengers were dancing, leaving you on the curb, as cars drove by and people gawked \u2014 one more piece of your pride TODAY.My parents came from Nigeria to Milwaukee in 1985. They saw a land of opportunity. They had gone to college in Nigeria. Their families had always been allowed to pursue their dreams. Their hard work had always paid off.And mine did, too. I\u2019m 29 years old. I am an editor for The New York Times.Does that make me more or less of a credible voice? In this national discussion about how we equalize opportunity in this post-Jim Crow era, in all of the ways that matter right now, am I even black? Or are these questions just survivor\u2019s guilt? Maybe it\u2019s just pitiful angst that has no answer and doesn\u2019t need any.Or maybe the angst can lead to answers.Before I started writing this essay, I spoke to Mandela Barnes, a state legislator who represents a district in Northwest Milwaukee, about the city and the violence. I imagined a teenager on the North Side, politically active, moderate in many ways, dedicated to helping our people. Someone maybe like me, trying to figure out how to do something that would address all the injustice.Considering the minimal loss of life from the week\u2019s unrest, and the relatively contained property damage, what do you say to a kid who says \u201cthis worked, attention is now being paid to our situation, and my friends in other cities should do the same thing?\u201dI asked him: How can you convince that teenager to take a different path when his or her friends are riding a pipeline to prison?\u201cAs frustrating as things can be, you never want to destroy your own,\u201d Mr. Barnes said. \u201cLiterally burning up your own home is not the route. There are other ways to make your voice heard.\u201dHonestly, I have my doubts. They are new, and I am nearly consumed by them. Maybe that\u2019s just the North Side of me. Or maybe that\u2019s just me.An earlier version of this article included incorrect information about a man who was shot by a police officer in Milwaukee.

{"Headline": "Think Tank Scholar or Corporate Consultant? It Depends on the Day", "Date": "2016-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Over the many months that officials in Washington debated sweeping new regulations for internet providers, Jeffrey A. Eisenach, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, was hard to miss.And he has plenty of company.An examination of 75 think tanks found an array of researchers who had simultaneously worked as registered lobbyists, members of corporate boards or outside consultants in litigation and regulatory disputes, with only intermittent disclosure of their dual roles.With their expertise and authority, think tank scholars offer themselves as independent arbiters, playing a vital role in Washington\u2019s political economy. Their imprimatur helps shape government decisions that can be lucrative to corporations.But the examination identified dozens of examples of scholars conducting research at think tanks while corporations were paying them to help shape government policy. Many think tanks also readily confer \u201cnonresident scholar\u201d status on lobbyists, former government officials and others who earn their primary living working for private clients, with few restrictions on such outside work.Largely free from disclosure requirements, the researchers\u2019 work is often woven into elaborate corporate lobbying campaigns.And it is a decidedly bipartisan practice.The overlapping roles are often not made clear, and even members of Congress say they are frequently unaware of the financial ties between industries and the witnesses with think tank titles appearing before them at hearings.\u201cThey can make a very deceptive and false claim to credibility that is totally lacking,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who said he had become increasingly disturbed by the role of think tank experts on Capitol Hill. \u201cI think about it every time there is a witness now from a \u2018think tank,\u2019 putting that term in very boldface quotes.\u201dScholars sometimes include general references to their private-sector work in their official biographies. Mr. Eisenach, for example, notes that he is an executive at NERA Economic Consulting in addition to his position at the American Enterprise Institute. And when a private company pays him or his consulting firm to publish a study, he discloses the name of the corporate sponsor on the study.But there is no way for the public or policy makers to know Mr. Eisenach\u2019s full roster of NERA clients. And there is no comprehensive disclosure of these clients when he writes his think tank reports or academic papers, testifies before Congress, or meets with F.C.C. members or staff.Mr. Eisenach declined repeated requests to comment in detail. But a spokeswoman for the American Enterprise Institute, Judy Mayka Stecker, said she saw no conflict in his roles.\u201cWe believe in the open competition of ideas and encourage our scholars to engage with experts from all sectors and viewpoints,\u201d she said.A footnote on the first page of the letter indicated that none of the scholars who signed had been compensated by stakeholder companies. But of the dozen studies they submitted as evidence, more than half had been funded by telecommunications giants or based on other work for the companies, industry ties that were disclosed only in footnotes in the original studies.No federal rules required broader disclosure. Yet on many highly technical policy issues like telecommunications regulation, scholarship is dominated by industry-funded research, according to a review of hundreds of studies, regulatory filings and other documents.\u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re in legal and you want to have a paper that says what you want it to say,\u201d said Dennis Weller, a former Verizon economist who occasionally consults for telecommunications companies and international organizations. \u201cYou could have a bunch of economists in house and ask them if they agree with you. How much easier would it be to go to an outside economist and say, \u2018How about if I pay you $100,000 to write this?\u2019\u201dFew policy battles have had higher stakes in recent years than the debate over net neutrality \u2014 a catchall term for proposals to restrict internet service providers from blocking websites or regulating speed.To bolster their claims that the regulations would hurt consumers, companies have financed research that contends the rules would reduce investment in new services and raise prices. That work is used to shape the public debate and to build an industry-funded narrative in the regulatory record, one that the F.C.C. is required by law to evaluate.Industry-sponsored research has also figured prominently in court battles over F.C.C. efforts to regulate the internet. When Verizon successfully opposed an earlier F.C.C. rule on net neutrality, more than half of the 23 studies or expert declarations cited in court filings had been sponsored directly by telecommunications companies or trade associations, according to an analysis by The Times. Other studies had been published under the banner of think tanks but written by scholars who consulted extensively for companies.The attacks began to grow particularly heated nearly two years ago, when Mr. Obama called on Mr. Wheeler and his fellow F.C.C. commissioners to regulate the internet like traditional phone lines.The study mentioned their employment at Economists Incorporated, a consulting firm in Washington. But a reader would have had to do more research to learn that Economists Incorporated\u2019s clients included AT&T and Verizon, companies leading the industry\u2019s charge against the commission proposal. That was disclosed on a \u201cselect client list\u201d on the Economists Incorporated website.\u201cPeople who are running advertisements are not going to say, \u2018In a study we paid for,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Litan, now an adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cIn the public discourse, the disclaimers often do get dropped.\u201d\u201cNone of us works for free,\u201d Mr. Singer wrote. \u201cSo let\u2019s focus on the merits & be nice to each other!\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Singer said he \u2014 like most scholars \u2014 disclosed when a client commissioned a particular study published through his consulting firm. Most specialists in the telecommunications field, he suggested, are well aware of his business connections and views on regulatory issues.\u201cEverybody is on different teams,\u201d Mr. Singer said. \u201cSo long as you tell the audience what team you are on, you can then offer the opinions. Disclosure is the antidote to all of this.\u201dFew scholars have been as active in the net neutrality debate as Mr. Eisenach.\u201cJeff is good at linking big theoretical ideas to policy, and he\u2019s been good at making money doing that,\u201d said Mr. Weller, the former Verizon economist. \u201cHe\u2019s been good at moving from think tank to think tank and company to company, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever lost money doing it.\u201dAt a given moment, it can be difficult to determine which hat Mr. Eisenach is wearing.In September 2014, at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on net neutrality, the formal meeting agenda listed Mr. Eisenach as a visiting scholar at the institute.Scholar, consultant, expert witness \u2014 Jeffrey A. Eisenach has worn all these hats while playing a leading role in the debate over telecommunications policy in the United States. Here is a look at the potential conflicts that this situation creates for Mr. Eiensach, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.He then detailed his vehement opposition to further federal regulation of the internet.Mr. Eisenach was similarly ambiguous when he interacted with members of the F.C.C., according to dozens of emails obtained by The Times, all but one of which was sent from Mr. Eisenach\u2019s email address at the American Enterprise Institute.On behalf of the think tank, he sought meetings with F.C.C. commissioners and lawyers to discuss the rules, and briefed the commission\u2019s Republican members on what its general counsel was telling him about Mr. Wheeler\u2019s thinking. Mr. Eisenach offered speaking slots at American Enterprise Institute events to the two Republican members on the commission, urging one to use a January 2015 forum to speak out against the proposed regulations.Ms. Stecker, the institute spokeswoman, said it should be no surprise that the opinions of experts like Mr. Eisenach were in demand. The think tank requires scholars to submit an annual report on any \u201coutside activities,\u201d she added, and A.E.I. has \u201cnot as an institution sought to influence or constrain\u201d this work.While private consulting arrangements can leave scholars\u2019 ties to corporate interests murky, the conflict is more apparent when think tank researchers do double duty as registered lobbyists.Mr. Verdery, a former senior official at the Department of Homeland Security whose office helped run the inspection program at foreign airports, briefly mentioned that in addition to his status as a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, he was the founder of the Monument Policy Group.Officials at the Toronto airport, with Mr. Verdery\u2019s help, have been trying to persuade the American authorities to increase staff and equipment to reduce bottlenecks sometimes created by the preclearance program.Asked whether it was appropriate for a lobbyist to host his clients at a think tank event, Mr. Verdery said, \u201cIt is fairly typical.\u201dMr. Verdery is not paid by the think tank, he noted. He does benefit from the C.S.I.S. title, however, when laying out a client\u2019s case.As of late last year, at least 70 unpaid senior advisers and associates listed on the think tank\u2019s website had simultaneously worked as consultants. Seven others listed as C.S.I.S. senior advisers or associates during the past five years had worked as registered corporate lobbyists while holding the positions.Officials at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, when asked about Mr. Verdery, said his December presentation should not have occurred.\u201cThis event did not meet our standards of transparency and integrity,\u201d the think tank said in a statement in response to questions. \u201cThis constituted a lapse in oversight from C.S.I.S.\u201dMr. Verdery is no longer listed among the think tank\u2019s senior associates.Bruce Bartlett, a scholar who has worked at the Cato Institute and the Heritage Foundation, said it was becoming the norm in Washington for lobbyists and consultants like Mr. Verdery to vie for nonresident scholar posts to help them burnish sales pitches to corporate clients.\u201cClients prefer it that way,\u201d Mr. Bartlett said. \u201cThey get a chance to have their work done by scholars.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think they see any downside,\u201d Mr. Miller said of his corporate clients and the think tank.While Mr. Miller is not well known, he has high-profile company.Mr. Dorgan did not immediately register as a lobbyist, but his firm has oil and gas industry clients.Asked if his dual role represented a conflict of interest, Mr. Dorgan said that the premise of the Bipartisan Policy Center was \u201cto bring interested parties together to find solutions to difficult problems,\u201d and that he was proud to work there.Mr. Zakheim, of the American Enterprise Institute, is also a lobbyist at Covington & Burling L.L.P., where, on behalf of BAE Systems, he is urging Congress and the Defense Department to increase spending on ground combat vehicles that the company manufactures. Other clients include Northrop Grumman, which is building a new long-range Air Force bomber.Some scholars add another twist: They serve on corporate boards directly related to their areas of expertise at think tanks.Dr. McClellan, a former commissioner at the Food and Drug Administration who until January was a senior fellow at Brookings, has been a go-to expert for the federal government as it debates how to cope with surging costs of prescription drugs.At public events, Dr. McClellan emphasized the extraordinary progress by the pharmaceutical industry in coming up with treatments for diseases like diabetes, H.I.V. and hepatitis C.Dr. McClellan, in a statement, disputed any suggestion that he might have had a conflict.\u201cMy entire career in academics, government and public policy has focused on evidence-based ways to improve health and restrain costs for consumers, and my extensive track record speaks for itself,\u201d he said.She said that her change of heart on nuclear power had predated her engagement with Nuclear Matters, and was motivated by her desire to combat climate change, not by payment from the industry.\u201cObviously, the single most important thing any individual has is their reputation,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cI have worked really hard to be forthcoming about what I stand for and believe in. I am who I am.\u201dAdam S. Posen, the president of the Peterson Institute, considered the world\u2019s pre-eminent think tank on global economics, has a commanding view of the construction of the new headquarters for the American Enterprise Institute, as well as the main office of Brookings. In his office, he recently had a series of uncomfortable conversations with three scholars he had decided to let go.After much internal debate, Mr. Posen decided to formally prohibit Peterson\u2019s scholars from holding outside jobs that directly related to the field they wrote about on behalf of the think tank.The three who had such outside engagements were terminated.Mr. Posen noted that the change did not imply the researchers had done anything wrong. But tighter rules are needed, he said, to respond to a growing sense he shares with the Peterson board that the think tank industry must reassert its commitment to impartiality.\u201cI live in a glass house,\u201d said Mr. Posen, a Harvard-trained economist who previously served on the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England, gesturing toward the floor-to-ceiling glass that provides him stunning views.\u201cOur reputation is built on our credibility,\u201d Mr. Posen said. \u201cWithout being perceived as credible and objective, our studies just get thrown on the scrap heap.\u201dThe Urban Institute, a Washington-based think tank that focuses on issues confronting cities, has decided to require that its scholars with any outside jobs detail the relationship in their writings.And at Brookings, executives imposed new rules in December requiring that unpaid nonresident scholars use their title from any paying job, not from Brookings, if they testify before Congress. They are also prohibited from using their affiliation with Brookings in any research report they publish under contract with an outside party.\u201cI\u2019ve moved on to other issues,\u201d Mr. Eisenach said.\u201cIt has gotten to the point where everyone in Washington has their own expert,\u201d Mr. Medvetz said. \u201cIt is yet another reflection of the tremendous influence of economic power in American politics \u2014 as with money, you can create your own vehicles of political influence.\u201dStill, not everyone is worried about the multiple roles played by think tank scholars.\u201cEveryone\u2019s got their point of view,\u201d Mr. Walden said in an interview last year. \u201cAnd some of them get paid to have that point of view.\u201dBrooke Williams is a reporter at the New England Center for Investigative Reporting, which collaborated with The New York Times on this series.

{"Headline": "A Widow Takes the Helm at Blackberry Farm", "Date": "2016-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by13 PhotosWALLAND, Tenn. \u2014 For someone who could ski as well as Sam Beall, his first run down a Colorado slope that February afternoon was supposed to be easy.His father, Samuel E. Beall III, who founded the Ruby Tuesday chain and whom everyone calls Sandy, hired a lawyer who investigated. Mr. Beall came to the conclusion everyone else had: that Sam, a superb athlete who thought nothing of racing 100 miles on his bicycle or wrestling a 400-pound marlin out of the Gulf of Mexico, had died in a freakish accident, and that no one was to blame.\u201cA lot of times, he was doing crazy things,\u201d said Mary Celeste Beall, 39, the woman with whom he fell in love in high school and who for 18 years was his wife. \u201cIf he had been hot-dogging or jumping off cliffs, I would have been mad. But there\u2019s no explanation.\u201dThe Bealls, who divided their time between a house they built on the farm and one in Knoxville, Tenn., had five children. The oldest is about to enter the University of Georgia. The youngest is 3. It has fallen to Mrs. Beall to raise her family and step into her husband\u2019s role as the proprietor and president of Blackberry Farm.For the better part of a decade, Blackberry Farm has been a significant player in the elevation of both hyper-local Southern cooking and the idea of a luxury vacation built around agriculture. Its collection of cottages and farmhouses sits on 4,200 hilly acres in a part of rural Tennessee that needs the 500 jobs the resort provides.Critics love its cheeses, jam and beer. Chefs around the country long for an invitation to cook in the Barn, its showcase restaurant built in a 200-year-old barn that Mr. Beall had dismantled and moved from Pennsylvania.His death plunged Mrs. Beall into a role she had never imagined. She\u2019s a private person, and the first to tell you she is not as good at prioritizing as her husband was.But now she is the one hosting winemakers and explaining the Blackberry philosophy at events like the Food and Wine Classic in Aspen. The future of the multimillion-dollar family business is in her hands, and so far, she can barely keep up with the meetings.In the horrible first days after the accident, Mrs. Beall was so focused on the kids, the funeral and her own grief that she hadn\u2019t thought much about who might run the place. Shortly after her husband was buried, her father-in-law walked into the couple\u2019s bedroom.\u201cMary Celeste, you know you auditioned when you got up at the service to speak,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou know you have to run Blackberry.\u201dOver a recent breakfast in the sunny dining room of the 1930s farmhouse that remains the farm\u2019s center, Mr. Beall conceded that the conversation may have come sooner \u201cthan anyone with more sensitivity might have done.\u201dBut there were guests to care for and a family empire to protect.\u201cShe knows, like we all know, that Blackberry will be in our family forever, forever and another forever and another forever on top of that,\u201d he said.Mr. Beall and his first wife, Kreis, bought the little inn tucked up against the Great Smoky Mountains in 1976, the year Sam was born. They kept adding land and rooms, and serving food that punched above its weight. In 1998, they turned what had become a Relais & Ch\u00e2teaux resort over to Sam and his younger brother, David. But it was Sam who made the place his life\u2019s work.Building on the business acumen he learned from his father and a preternatural touch for hospitality and aesthetics that he got from his mother, Sam Beall coaxed Blackberry Farm into a culinary powerhouse, with a wine cellar that held the kind of Gaja nebbiolos and rare Rh\u00f4ne varieties most sommeliers could only dream of.It was all built on a foundation of simple Tennessee country life as reinterpreted for guests willing to pay a premium to taste its pleasures without any of its hardships. Blackberry Farm became a place where the powerful could lose themselves on a rope swing and where rich Manhattanites could put on hiking boots and wander down to the trout stream. What most people call a walk in the woods was rebranded as forest bathing.The spa sells $450 bottles of face cream, but there is also an old fellow with an encyclopedic knowledge of East Tennessee seeds and plants who gets paid to hang out near the garden in case guests want to chat or hand-mill some corn for grits. There are Smoky Mountain trails to hike, a box with Hershey bars and marshmallows near the nightly bonfire and shampoo custom blended with bourbon and Appalachian hyssop.Whether Blackberry led the South\u2019s culinary renaissance or rode its wave is still something students of Southern food debate, but there is no doubt it has had an outsize impact on the region.\u201cHe has turned the world on to what East Tennessee has to offer, but also helped those who live here in the region see themselves in a new way,\u201d said Ashley Capps, the Knoxville native who started the four-day Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival, which brings almost 80,000 people to Manchester, Tenn., each summer.Mrs. Beall said her husband didn\u2019t invent anything new at Blackberry. \u201cHe always just wanted to bring light to what was already here,\u201d she said.In the six months since her husband died, Mrs. Beall has been learning the business, but her primary focus has been on her children. She wants to keep the family rituals and rhythms the same, especially when it comes to meals.Mr. Beall, who studied at the California Culinary Academy and at Northern California culinary temples like Cowgirl Creamery and the French Laundry, was so dedicated to cooking his family dinner that it was not uncommon to see him standing in the kitchen in sweaty bike clothes, digging though his collection of olive oils and vinegars and a pile of produce from the Blackberry garden. At his funeral, his oldest daughter, Cameron, joked that she would miss being late for school because he had decided the family needed waffles for breakfast.Mrs. Beall was often the one left cleaning their huge kitchen and admonishing Mr. Beall to put on a clean shirt when the family sat down to dinner. She\u2019s thinking about adding another cookbook to the Blackberry Farm collection, one in which the children cook their dad\u2019s favorite hits.\u201cI really want it to feel like he\u2019s in the kitchen with them,\u201d she said. Already, her 7-year-old daughter, Josephine, has taken to making soft scrambled eggs just as her father taught her, and her only son, Sam V, 13, can saber a Champagne bottle and coax perfect, thin slices from a ham that had been curing in his father\u2019s personal wine cellar for three years.\u201cI really don\u2019t think there\u2019s one thing their dad hasn\u2019t taught them,\u201d she said.\u201cThe world doesn\u2019t know how to grieve,\u201d Mrs. Beall said. \u201cNo one talks about it. Our society needs to learn to have real conversations about things. It doesn\u2019t have to be a therapy session, just a real conversation.\u201dHer friends, like Kimberly Schlapman, a singer in the band Little Big Town and a cooking personality, is encouraging Mrs. Beall to carry on where Mr. Beall left off. Ms. Schlapman\u2019s husband died after a heart attack in 2005.\u201cI know from being a widow myself how very important it is for that man\u2019s dreams to live on through her,\u201d she said.Mrs. Beall, who has a graduate degree in accounting from the University of Tennessee and loves design and architecture, is relying on the tight-knit team of loyal, longtime employees her husband built. Many described her leadership style as inspirational, but she said she is still feeling her way. Managing time seems to be the most vexing part of her new job.\u201cNow I know why Sam was so hard to get ahold of,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was in all these meetings all day.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s never a good time to lose the love of your life, but the timing was amazing,\u201d she said.At his memorial service, she addressed the staff assembled at the Knoxville church directly. \u201cSam was preparing us,\u201d she told them. \u201cHe was preparing us to be independent, to do this.\u201dIndeed, the staff\u2019s dedication to hospitality was clear in the days after his death. The lodge never shut down, not even on the day of his funeral.After the service, his body was taken back to the farm. The coffin, a pine box his mother had made for herself years earlier, was loaded onto a wagon. As the family followed, two of the farm\u2019s best horses began pulling Mr. Beall across his beloved land one last time to a grave dug next to a tiny chapel on a rise near the edge of the property.Staff members had lined up along the gravel path to watch him pass. In the inn\u2019s old days, before the Bealls took over, staff members would wave white napkins from the veranda as guests departed. They called it the Blackberry salute.As Mr. Beall\u2019s coffin passed, they raised white napkins. Then they headed back to tend to the guests, most of whom had no idea that the man who had built Blackberry Farm was buried that day.An earlier version of this article misstated the year Kimberly Schlapman\u2019s husband died. It was 2005, not 2012.cookingcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Laurie the Moose Lady Puts \u2018Heart and Soul\u2019 Into Roadkill", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Laurie Speakman is passionate about moose meat.Partly it is the flavor of the meat, which to her is milder than beef, and great on the barbecue. What matters even more, she said, is moose meat for charity.So it irks her, she said, when moose go missing. Under state law, animals struck and killed on Alaska\u2019s highways are state property and may be handled only by authorized groups like the federation. But illegal carcass harvesting is occurring with increasing frequency in Alaska, said the group\u2019s executive director, Don Dyer, who just last week stumbled upon evidence that pointed to moose theft.\u201cThis last Sunday about 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, we got a call, and we got out there and someone had cut an entire shoulder out of a moose,\u201d Mr. Dyer said in a telephone interview. \u201cSome people out there say, \u2018Well, it\u2019s just roadkill,\u2019 and if they\u2019re hungry, they\u2019re entitled to it, but the fact of the matter is that when somebody steals a whole moose, it impacts a lot of people.\u201dThe goal of distributing meat from animals killed on the road is not new in Alaska, but before the creation of the federation in 2002, that meant butchering the animal where it died. The work could take a team two or three hours, cutting up 250 to 300 pounds of meat or more, sometimes in dangerous traffic and brutal weather. Transport by the federation\u2019s drivers \u2014 there are now six, including Ms. Speakman \u2014 cleared crash sites faster and saved time and money for state troopers.People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, for example, the advocacy group better known by its acronym, PETA, has endorsed the harvest of animals killed on the road as a more ethical and humane way to get meat than through commercial agriculture practices that use feedlots and slaughterhouses.And at least one academic who has studied the issue said he believed evolution was changing the behavior of animal populations, which have learned to adapt to the ribbons of highway and the shiny machines that roar past day and night.The legal wrinkles of harvesting animals killed on the road vary. In Idaho, for example, people are required to call a wildlife worker or law enforcement official to kill an injured animal before it can be taken. In Washington, salvagers can load a dead deer or elk into their vehicle and drive away, but they must contact the Department of Fish and Wildlife within 24 hours to get a permit.Ms. Speakman said she feels loved by those she helps. Several local organizations and Alaska Native tribal groups regularly give her gas cards to help out.\u201cI\u2019ve had a few charities that made me breakfast. Some will give me coffee. I kind of get spoiled a little bit,\u201d she said. But she draws the line at taking any meat for herself. \u201cI\u2019ve had a couple of charities offer some to me, and I will not accept it \u2014 there are needy families out there, and I don\u2019t want to take away from them.\u201dShe gets her moose meat by hunting. And she is thinking of eventually writing her own moose-meat cookbook. \u201cI\u2019ve got some recipes,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fake ISIS Attack in Prague, Intended as Protest, Causes Panic", "Date": "2016-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWe are bringing you the light of true faith,\u201d the leader of the men, Martin Konvicka, who was dressed as an imam, told the crowd.Mr. Konvicka is an anti-immigration activist, and his stunt \u2014 which had been preapproved by City Hall \u2014 was intended to sound the alarm about what he views as the threat posed by Islam to the Czech way of life. But he evidently did not anticipate how it would be received.The faux occupation stirred panic among tourists, including a group of visitors from Israel. Dozens of onlookers, including some with children, ran for cover, knocking over chairs at restaurants. Several tourists suffered bruises.\u201cI was entering Old Town Square from a far corner and heard gunshots,\u201d said Andrea Steinova, a Prague resident. \u201cThen I saw a group of about 40 people, some of them yelling in Hebrew, running toward me. A couple of them tripped and fell, and others ran over them.\u201dKristyna Vinsova, a server at Kotleta, a restaurant on the square, said about 80 people charged through the doors. \u201cThey knocked over tables and chairs, they were absolutely terrified and there were many families with children,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter about 15 minutes, one man went to see what was going on and came back to tell us it was a \u2018theatrical performance.\u2019 But it took many of the people around an hour to actually calm down and leave.\u201dAaron Gunsberger, who owns a kosher restaurant in the Jewish quarter, grabbed his gun and ran to the square, fearful that an attack was taking place.\u201cWhen I figured out what was happening, I told some puzzled American tourists that this was just our local clown, but that I didn\u2019t think it was funny,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they had shown up like this in front of my restaurant, I\u2019d be in jail now because I would have shot them.\u201dGun laws in the Czech Republic are generally less restrictive than in most other parts of Europe, and Josefov \u2014 whose synagogues and cemetery survived World War II because the Nazi occupiers intended for the quarter to become a museum of the extinct Jewish race \u2014 is, like many Jewish neighborhoods in Europe, carefully guarded.The act over the weekend was halted before it got to its planned end: The simulated killing of a prisoner, dressed in an orange jumpsuit, in the square.Not all tourists were sent into panic.Footage showed some onlookers taking photographs or videos, and even giggling. Other people taunted the protesters; one woman shouted at the men, \u201cXenophobe! Xenophobe!\u201dMr. Konvicka, an entomologist at University of South Bohemia in Ceske Budejovice, in the country\u2019s south, founded a group called \u201cWe don\u2019t want Islam in the Czech Republic.\u201d He had called the protest \u201cThe Occupation of Prague\u201d and scheduled it for Sunday, the 48th anniversary of the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968.In a telephone interview, Mr. Konvicka said it was obvious that the mock attack was a stunt, adding, \u201cThe police checked our air guns and even counted how many bearded guys were in our group, to make sure we didn\u2019t deviate from what we told City Hall we would do.\u201dA spokesman for the Prague police, Tomas Hulan, said the department had no power to ban the event as it had been approved by City Hall. He said officers had questioned eight people and were looking into whether anyone could be charged for disturbing the peace.City Hall officials defended their decision to allow the protest but acknowledged that they had not fully understood what would unfold. \u201cWe only had very basic information of what the spectacle would be like,\u201d said Vit Hofman, a spokesman for City Hall. \u201cHad we known what was going to transpire, we would certainly have banned it.\u201dThe Czech Republic, like other countries in Europe, has been grappling with fears about Islamic terrorism that are being exploited across the political spectrum.The country has about 10.5 million people, with roughly 20,000 Muslims.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed, Eager to Show It\u2019s Listening, Welcomes Protesters", "Date": "2016-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When a dozen protesters in green T-shirts showed up two years ago at the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., they were regarded by many participants as an amusing addition.Two years later, they have won a place on the schedule.The protesters, who want the Fed to extend its economic stimulus campaign, are scheduled to meet on Thursday with eight members of the central bank\u2019s policy-making committee. At the start of a conference devoted to esoteric debates about monetary policy, officials will hear from people struggling to make ends meet.The Fed\u2019s effort to show that it is listening to its critics reflects the central bank\u2019s broader struggle to find its footing in an era whose great challenge is not the strength of inflation, but the weakness of economic growth.\u201cWe want to make sure that regular voices are being heard,\u201d Mr. Barkan said in beginning the campaign two years ago. The American economy, he said, was not working for all Americans \u2014 particularly not for blacks and other minority groups.Fed officials so far have chosen to accommodate the group by applauding its efforts at public education, not by seriously engaging its arguments that interest rates should be raised more slowly. Esther George, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, which hosts the Jackson Hole conference, arranged Thursday\u2019s meeting with the activists. She said in an interview earlier this year that the Fed must balance job growth with other issues, like financial stability.\u201cI am completely sympathetic,\u201d she said of the group\u2019s concerns.But she cautioned that the Fed\u2019s powers were limited. Pushing too hard to lower unemployment could lead to higher inflation, or speculative bubbles, that would force the Fed to raise interest rates more quickly. The resulting economic volatility could end up doing more harm than good.\u201cThe Federal Reserve has become somehow the answer to many problems far beyond what we can actually address,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish I could fix all of it with a tool like monetary policy. But we can\u2019t.\u201dFed Up\u2019s more visible success has come in pursuit of a longer-term goal: advocating for changes in the Fed\u2019s governance that could eventually shift its decision-making.Moreover, the report said that whites composed 83 percent of the directors of the Fed\u2019s 12 regional reserve banks, who select the regional presidents.Narayana Kocherlakota, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said that the absence of minorities was \u201cquite troubling.\u201d\u201cThose kinds of persistent absences of key demographic groups really suggest that the appointment process, there is something that can be fixed there,\u201d he said.Fed Up also argued that bank executives should not sit on regional Fed boards. Under current law, bankers hold three of the nine seats on each board. The regional reserve banks are owned by the commercial banks in each district, although they operate under the authority of the Fed\u2019s board, a government agency whose members are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.On the same day, a spokesman for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign said in a statement that \u201cSecretary Clinton believes that the Fed needs to be more representative of America as a whole and that common sense reforms \u2014 like getting bankers off the boards of regional Federal Reserve Banks \u2014 are long overdue.\u201dTwo months later, the Democratic Party adopted a campaign platform that included similar language, the first time in recent decades it mentioned the Fed.\u201cHaving a diverse set of policy makers \u2014 including African-Americans and Hispanics \u2014 will influence the Fed\u2019s decision-making,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it should. The public should have confidence that the public is well represented at the F.O.M.C. table.\u201d\u201cEven if they move once less over the course of several years, that\u2019s still massive,\u201d he said earlier this year. \u201cThe number of people who have jobs because of that, or higher wages, that dwarves a $15-an-hour wage increase in a smaller city.\u201dLael Brainard, a Fed governor who plans to attend the Thursday meeting, made a point last year of visiting the parallel conference Mr. Barkan staged on the sidelines of the Fed event. And Mr. Barkan\u2019s group has now succeeded in persuading each of the regional reserve presidents to meet with groups of local workers.Neel Kashkari, the new president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, met with Fed Up\u2019s local affiliate, Neighborhoods Organizing for Change, this month, telling the group that he shared their concern about the persistence of higher rates of unemployment among blacks and other minority groups.Mr. Kashkari also accepted an invitation to spend a day with one of the group\u2019s members, Rosheeda Credit, a Minneapolis resident who described the struggles she and her boyfriend faced to cover the cost of rent and child care for their five children.\u201cWalking a day in somebody else\u2019s shoes is actually \u2014 it makes the anecdotes that much more real,\u201d Mr. Kashkari, who arrived at the bank in January, told reporters after the meeting. \u201cIt influences how I think about the problems we face.\u201dAdvertisement"}

To different degrees, we have all been guilty of cryptomnesia. And in a world flooded with information, we are especially prone to forgetting where ideas originated.\u201cIt\u2019s a common error that we all do, all the time,\u201d she said.Psychologists think cryptomnesia happens when we fail to register the source of information \u2014 what\u2019s known as a source-monitoring error. As our brains amass memories, details are ranked. In this filtering process, the origins of facts often fall secondary to the facts themselves.Cryptomnesia may actually be a byproduct of an otherwise efficient memory system, Dr. Gingerich said. \u201cIf you think about it, it\u2019s not very cognitively efficient to remember every single detail of everything that happens to us.\u201dLater, the researchers asked participants to recall the items they had come up with, and to brainstorm new examples. In both tasks, nearly three-fourths named at least one item that someone else in the group had already mentioned. Plagiarized responses accounted for 7 percent to 9 percent of the total.In other experiments, Dr. Dow found that novices were more likely to commit accidental plagiarism than experts, and that people were more prone to cryptomnesia when multitasking.As people are bombarded with more and more material, \u201chow we store that information is so much more challenging,\u201d Dr. Gingerich said.\u201cYou scroll through a Facebook feed,\u201d she added, \u201cand there\u2019s an infinite number of pieces of information coming from so many different sources.\u201dThere\u2019s no need to question yourself in real time, but to remember to go back deliberately, he added. \u201cI don\u2019t think musicians should sit there, play a chord sequence and go, \u201cWell, that probably sounds like something else,\u2019 \u201d he said.Instead, every now and then, check each piece of information or material. \u201cAsk yourself: \u2018Where did I get this information from? Is it mine? Did I borrow it from someone else? Have I accurately shared the source?\u2019 \u201dIt may be harder for musicians, because they\u2019re \u201cdrawing on all sorts of different things,\u201d Dr. Landau acknowledged. Still, he said, \u201cif they\u2019re careful, they may say, \u2018Oh, that kind of sounds like that other song I heard on the radio.\u2019 \u201d\u201cNevertheless, it is clear that \u2018My Sweet Lord\u2019 is the very same song as \u2018He\u2019s So Fine\u2019 with different words, and Harrison had access to \u2018He\u2019s So Fine,\u2019\u201d Judge Owens said. \u201cThis is, under the law, infringement of copyright, and is no less so even though subconsciously accomplished.\u201dAdvertisement"}

These include the ability to track employees\u2019 whereabouts and spending and to charge expenses to a corporate credit card.Mr. Milbourn is one of many business travelers now choosing Airbnb or other home-sharing services, like HomeAway and VRBO, over conventional hotels.A report issued last month by Concur, a travel and expense management company, found that the number of nights that its 42 million business travel customers spent in home-sharing accommodations rose more than 50 percent from the first quarter of 2015 to the first quarter of this year.Airbnb is actively cultivating this clientele, having recently reached agreements with three big business travel management companies in the United States: American Express Global Business Travel, BCD Travel and Carlson Wagonlit Travel.Under these agreements, Airbnb will send data on travelers\u2019 expenditures and itineraries to the travel management companies, which in turn will share the information with the travelers\u2019 employers, their clients. The employers can then use this data to monitor employees\u2019 spending and travel and to track them down, as needed, if there is an emergency.But some business travelers who have used Airbnb, especially those whose bosses booked the accommodations for them, warn that bad surprises can sometimes await.Alexa Pothier, a Boston-based consultant for a Palo Alto, Calif., software company, who has used Airbnb occasionally during vacations with generally positive results, had a different outcome on a business trip in 2014 when she stayed at a one-bedroom apartment in the Shoreditch neighborhood of London.The host owned a small business in a storefront on the ground floor, which Ms. Pothier had to walk through to reach the stairs to the apartment. Although the apartment had a large living space, where Ms. Pothier said she could work comfortably, she was startled by a mouse that \u201cearly on scampered very quickly across the couch.\u201dAnd the bedroom window overlooked a noisy street, which forced her to use earplugs that the host had left in a bowl next to the bed.When Katie Gilligan, a New Yorker and a former account manager for a London-based ticket-booking service, traveled to London last year on business, her boss put her up for a week each at two apartments booked through Airbnb.The second apartment, in the King\u2019s Cross neighborhood, was owned by a woman who shared the living space and would not let Ms. Gilligan use the water or flush the toilet after 8 p.m. The host also walked around wearing only a towel, Ms. Gilligan said, \u201ctalking to me about her life experience and about aliens coming down and probing people.\u201dAll the more reason, perhaps, to use Airbnb\u2019s business travel services that include \u201cbusiness travel ready\u201d listings \u2014 accommodations geared toward business travelers\u2019 specific needs.To qualify, a lodging must meet various criteria, including high customer ratings; 24-hour check-in; accommodations that are an entire home or apartment, not shared with the owner; the availability of Wi-Fi and a laptop-friendly work space; and an iron, a hair dryer and other amenities.Chip Conley, head of global hospitality and strategy for Airbnb, said that more than 70,000 companies had made bookings through Airbnb for Business, a program introduced last year that features listings and travel management tools.Not all of those companies, however, are as willing as Payable to talk about their use of Airbnb.Some of the prominent companies that Mr. Conley and others at Airbnb have cited as business travel customers \u2014 including Facebook and Google \u2014 declined to discuss the topic for this article. And many of the companies that were willing, including Morgan Stanley, Salesforce, Twilio and TBWA, had other business relationships with Airbnb.Some professionals in the business travel industry acknowledge the potential benefits of using services like Airbnb, and see some of the drawbacks.Airbnb\u2019s affordable offerings could help budget-conscious attendees of conventions and meetings, Deborah Sexton, president and chief executive of the Professional Convention Management Association, said in an email. Home-sharing accommodations can also offer an attractive alternative when hotel rooms are sold out, she said.Depending on its location, an Airbnb property might not be the most convenient option for a business traveler, particularly someone attending a conference or convention, Ms. Sexton said.\u201cOne of the biggest perks of a host hotel is its central location,\u201d she said. \u201cFor attendees who stay at Airbnb properties in different neighborhoods, getting to an early-morning conference or attending a late-night evening reception may be more difficult.\u201dMs. Sexton and some other experts also raised safety and legal concerns.Although Airbnb offers host protection insurance, which provides primary coverage for Airbnb hosts and landlords in more than 15 countries against liability claims of up to $1 million, the coverage does not apply to liability from assault and battery, sexual abuse or molestation, or to acts of terrorism, among other events.William A. Brewer III, a lawyer in New York and Dallas who represents hotel owners \u2014 typically some of Airbnb\u2019s staunchest opponents \u2014 said hotel owners, managers and franchisers had an obligation to reduce foreseeable risks. For the traveler, he said, the question is whether the providers of lodging have a balance sheet strong enough to pay for their negligence if trouble occurs.\u201cI believe this is why businesses often place their faith in well-known hotel chains when booking employee travel,\u201d he added.But those concerns might be offset, Mr. Brewer said, if a traveler were on a long-term assignment and the employer could cut costs significantly by booking an Airbnb property. In this case, he said, the employer could find it worthwhile to \u201cexpend the amount of effort required for due diligence to offset any liability issues.\u201dAirbnb has sued San Francisco over a June decision by the city\u2019s Board of Supervisors to fine the company $1,000 a day for every unregistered host on its service.That followed a bipartisan move by New York lawmakers, who voted to heavily fine anyone who used Airbnb to rent an entire apartment for fewer than 30 days \u2014 a practice that has been illegal in the state since 2010.Nick Papas, an Airbnb spokesman, said the company would not let those disputes deter its efforts to cultivate a business traveler clientele. \u201cThus far, we\u2019ve seen that business and leisure travelers remain eager to use Airbnb in New York and San Francisco,\u201d he said.Bjorn Hanson, a professor at the Tisch Center for Hospitality and Tourism at New York University, said the travel management companies\u2019 agreements with Airbnb showed that they were \u201ceffectively endorsing\u201d Airbnb.\u201cThis changes the debate\u201d that Airbnb is having with New York and San Francisco, he said, and gives \u201cmuch more weight to Airbnb\u2019s side.\u201dAdvertisement"}

By then, he had become a social media sensation, as people watched live videos posted on Facebook and Periscope, a live video-streaming app. A stream on Facebook from WABC-TV in New York received more than four million views, and people commented along with the action. Clad in shorts and a T-shirt, the climber began to scale the building around 3:30 p.m., the police said, wearing a harness and using what appeared to be suction cups to aid his climb.Police did not release the name of the man, whom they took to Bellevue Hospital Center for an evaluation.On Wednesday night, Mr. Trump expressed his appreciation for the police on Twitter, writing, \u201cGreat job today by the NYPD in protecting the people and saving the climber.\u201dWith the climber\u2019s image being broadcast \u2014 and commented on \u2014 far and wide on Wednesday, the man perched, if only briefly, at the intersection of two unpredictable worlds: the combustible presidential campaign and the chaotic city beneath him.It has been a magnet for those making political statements: a protester in a Ku Klux Klan-style hood who tussled with security guards in September; 200 marchers in December; anti-gun activists in the spring. It has also been the site of a zoning tussle, magnified by the stakes of the presidential election, after the Trump Organization was forced to remove a Trump kiosk from its lobby, which had been designated as a public space as part of an agreement that allowed the developer to add 20 stories to the building\u2019s height.And it has burnished its status as a tourist attraction, drawing more than one million visitors every year from around the globe.On Wednesday, hundreds of people gawked from the streets below, filming the climb with cameras and phones, oohing after the man dropped an object. Some cheered for him, remarking on the difficulty of his climb. \u201cYou will never believe what I just saw,\u201d a woman leaving the commotion said into her cellphone.Aaron Hesseltine, 17, in town with his family from Saranac Lake, N.Y., to see Alex Rodriguez\u2019s last game with the Yankees, watched for an hour and a half, documenting the experience on Snapchat for his friends at home.

{"Headline": "Donald Trump, Wavering on Immigration, Finds Anger in All Corners", "Date": "2016-08-25", "News": "Supported byYet even that promise, so central to his appeal to conservatives, now appears open to negotiation.Mr. Trump faced anger, confusion and disgust from across the political spectrum on Thursday after indicating that he was open to letting some undocumented immigrants remain in the country legally provided that they paid \u201cback taxes.\u201dThe comments, made at a town-hall-style event broadcast the night before on Fox News, were strikingly similar to the views of former Gov. Jeb Bush and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, fellow Republicans whom Mr. Trump vanquished in the primaries with slashing attacks that they were soft on immigration.His newest formulation also bore a close resemblance to President Obama\u2019s approach to an immigration overhaul, which similarly calls for paying taxes as part of a program to live legally in the United States.\u201cHe finally figured out that you can\u2019t win a national election with just white voters,\u201d said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster who worked for Mr. Rubio\u2019s campaign.Republicans have narrowed the Democrats\u2019 lead in registered voters in several swing states, especially in North Carolina and Florida.But whatever the possible gains, Mr. Trump risks offending millions of conservatives who were drawn to his self-description as an unwavering opponent of illegal immigration. He vowed to build a wall on the Mexican border, called Mexicans \u201crapists\u201d in his kickoff speech and said every immigrant in the country illegally would be detained and forced out.\u201cIf Trump should pivot on immigration or try to redefine amnesty, he will begin to lose support from his original core base,\u201d warned Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, one of the most conservative voices on immigration in the House.In the Fox News interview, Mr. Trump appeared to suggest that he would be open to some kind of path to legal status, if not citizenship, for undocumented immigrants.\u201cNo citizenship,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019ll pay back taxes. They have to pay taxes,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s no amnesty, but we will work with them.\u201dMr. Trump said that while his supporters wanted to \u201cget the bad ones out,\u201d he also had heard from less-absolutist voters. \u201cThey\u2019ve said, \u2018Mr. Trump, I love you, but to take a person that has been here for 15 or 20 years and throw them and the family out, it\u2019s so tough, Mr. Trump,\u2019\u201d he said.\u201cNo. 1, we\u2019ll say throw out. No. 2, we work with them,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Liberals who support an overhaul of the nation\u2019s immigration laws expressed horror at the spectacle of polling the audience for responses on deportations.\u201cIt\u2019s not a small issue. It\u2019s 11 million people,\u201d said Angie Kelley, the executive director of the Center for American Progress Action Fund. \u201cHe\u2019s reducing a serious policy discussion to a pep-rally vote and cheering the loudest for your team. It\u2019s insulting. It\u2019s dangerous. It\u2019s unprecedented.\u201dMr. Trump has frequently dangled vague phrases suggestive of policy shifts, only to accuse the news media of having wrongly interpreted them. His remarks in the Fox News town hall were no exception: Aides insisted afterward that there had been no change in his position.On Thursday, Mr. Trump reverted to his more severe language on the subject, departing from his prepared text at a rally in New Hampshire to again promise a border wall \u2014 a line he has said he uses when he senses his audience losing energy.And in an interview on CNN taped Thursday, Mr. Trump, pressed to clarify his intentions, only muddled them, insisting he was not endorsing a path for immigrants to live legally in the United States unless they left the country first.Republicans, regardless of their views on immigration, seized on Mr. Trump\u2019s newest pronouncements on the subject as evidence of worrisome confusion or worse.Mr. Bush, in a radio interview, called Mr. Trump\u2019s shifting speech \u201cabhorrent\u201d and baffling.\u201cI don\u2019t know what to believe about a guy who doesn\u2019t believe in things,\u201d Mr. Bush said on WABC.Among immigration hard-liners, Ann Coulter, a conservative author \u2014 who is promoting a new book titled \u201cIn Trump We Trust\u201d \u2014 seemed almost apoplectic during Mr. Trump\u2019s town-hall-style event on Fox News.The Upshot\u2019s presidential forecast, updated daily.In her book, Ms. Coulter writes that the only unforgivable sin Mr. Trump could commit would be to shift on immigration.A Trump spokeswoman, Katrina Pierson, insisted on CNN that Mr. Trump was merely changing the \u201cwords\u201d he was using, not the proposals themselves.Democrats and immigration-overhaul advocates, in fact, made the same point.\u201cDetails matter, and we have seen no actual policy shift to date,\u201d said Todd Schulte, the president of FWD.us, an immigration overhaul group backed by the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg that has been sharply critical of Mr. Trump.Several Republican strategists said Mr. Trump had waited too long to try to woo nonwhite voters, if that was his aim. But Mr. Ayres, the pollster, suggested that Mr. Trump could gain ground with white Republican moderates repelled by the idea of voting for someone who is often accused of running a racist campaign \u2014 or, given his statements questioning the impartiality of a federal judge who is Mexican-American, of being a racist himself.Still, some Republicans privately questioned why, instead of shifting the discussion of immigration to economic concerns, which polls show is a dominant issue in the election, Mr. Trump has continued to draw attention to his detractors\u2019 claims that he is a bigot.Mr. Trump has struggled to hit on a successful message on immigration for the November election, in which he will face voters far less receptive to his uncompromising proposals than those in the primary season. A poll by the Pew Research Center, conducted Aug. 9 through 16, found that while 91 percent of strong Trump supporters advocate building the wall, 61 percent of Americans are against it.Mr. Trump\u2019s aides have said he will give a speech on immigration next week in Arizona \u2014 an address originally set for this week but delayed as he grappled with precisely what he would say.Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion that he would deport only \u201cthe bad ones\u201d while letting law-abiding undocumented immigrants stay is quite similar to the approach announced by Mr. Obama in November 2014, when he directed the Department of Homeland Security to prioritize its immigration enforcement on violent criminals and people who have crossed the border illegally multiple times.His statement about payment of \u201cback taxes\u201d is also very similar to the president\u2019s \u201cdeferred action\u201d proposals, which would have required millions of immigrants in the country illegally to pay taxes, among other things, in exchange for legal protections.At the White House, officials who have spent years trying to find ways to overhaul the nation\u2019s immigration system declined to be drawn into an examination of Mr. Trump\u2019s latest comments.Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said Thursday that the challenge for American voters as they considered the immigration positions of the two presidential candidates \u201cis to listen carefully to the promises, agenda and priorities, as articulated by the two candidates.\u201dMr. Earnest declined to say which of Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration positions he believed voters should consider.\u201cThat\u2019s what makes that question more difficult than it otherwise would be,\u201d Mr. Earnest said.Advertisement"}

Just ask Denise Tompkins of Naperville, Ill., married 36 years to John, now 69, who has Alzheimer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease.The Tompkinses participated in an unusual eight-week storytelling workshop at Northwestern University that is helping to keep the spark of love alive in couples coping with the challenges of encroaching dementia.Every week participants are given a specific assignment to write a brief story about events in their lives that they then share with others in the group. The program culminates with a moving, often funny, 20-minute written story read alternately by the partners in each couple in front of an audience.Each couple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story serves as a reminder of both the good and challenging times they have shared, experiences both poignant and humorous that reveal inner strength, resilience and love and appreciation for one another that can be easily forgotten when confronted by a frightening, progressive neurological disease like Alzheimer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been an amazing experience for us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Tompkins said of the program. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCreating our story revealed such a richness in our life together and is helping us keep that front and center going forward.\u00e2\u0080\u009dShe added that the program provides \u00e2\u0080\u009can opportunity to process what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going through and your relationship to each other. It helped me digest all the wonderful things about John and how well we relate as a couple, things that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go away with Alzheimer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease. John is so much more than his disease.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDitto for Robyn and Ben Ferguson of Chicago, married 42 years in 2012 when they learned that Ben, a psychologist, had Alzheimer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe diagnosis was crushing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his wife. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTelling people in the program about it helped us recognize the impact on our lives and relationship and really face that. It made things feel not quite so bad.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe Fergusons have publicly presented their 20-minute story together 19 times so far, helping to enlighten medical students and those training in social work and pastoral care, as well as researchers and members of the general public. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt reinforces our relationship as a couple, rather than caregiver and patient, even though he is 85 percent dependent on me for the activities of daily living.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDr. Ben Ferguson, now 69, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI feel we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re giving people information that could be very valuable in their future. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s helpful to them to see us smile, have a good time and give a good report \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as well as a bad report \u00e2\u0080\u0093 about what goes on with this disease. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s helpful for people to hear it from someone who has it, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s helped us avoid getting so morose.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAs for their presentations, which they now give almost monthly, his wife said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey help us stay positive and give us a sense of purpose. We both feel a real need to do advocacy work, and this is the best thing we can do right now. We know there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a sell-by date on this \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to do it forever. But we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think about that now. Now we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re focused on helping people understand that your life doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop with the diagnosis. We want people to hear that you go on with your life, even though you may need a lot of help.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAnother workshop participant, Sheila Nicholes, 76, of Chicago, said of her husband, Luther, who has vascular dementia, that the storytelling \u00e2\u0080\u009cbrings him back to being funny again. Writing our story together gave us a way to talk about these things, to think about where we were then and where we are now.\u00e2\u0080\u009dNoting that dementia is \u00e2\u0080\u009ca very hush-hush illness in our black community,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Nicholes said she hoped that telling their story would help others speak more openly about it and learn to \u00e2\u0080\u009cjust roll with the flow.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDuring the group sessions, Ms. Dowden said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so much laughter in the room, so much joy and love of life as well as poignancy and tears. As they move forward, as the disease progresses, they can be reminded of who they are, their strength and resilience, what has made their relationship strong, what they loved about the person, as opposed to just being patient and caregiver.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAs the program moves week to week, Ms. Dowden said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more touching, affection, looking at one another and laughing. There are delightful moments of connection when one member of a couple reveals something the other didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe weekly story assignments require that the couple collaborates, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand they learn how to work together in new ways, how to make adjustments, because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to make thousands and thousands of adjustments throughout the course of the disease.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn executing the workshop assignments, Dr. Ferguson said she would ask her husband questions, he would answer and she would write down what he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe workshop was really transformative,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt gave us hope for our future together in dealing with this disease.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMs. Dowden said the feedback from those in the audience for the 20-minute joint stories has been heartening. She explained, \u00e2\u0080\u009cStudents learn about the biology of neurodegenerative conditions. These stories enable them to see the human side of the disease, what it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like to live with it, and may help them develop programs that help these families live better. In addition to the stigma, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a tendency to write off people with dementia.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMs. Dowden said she is currently refining the workshop curriculum so that it can be used as a model for other institutions to replicate. She is also expanding it to include mother-daughter and sibling pairs.She realizes, of course, that a storytelling workshop may not be suitable for every couple. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not good if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of behavioral issues, a lot of conflict, and no insight,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut for those it does fit, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an opportunity to tap into the core of relationships, to still grow and learn and be delighted by one another.\u00e2\u0080\u009dRelated:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "China, Not Silicon Valley, Is Cutting Edge in Mobile Tech", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAll of these developments have something in common: The technology was first popularized in China.Silicon Valley has long been the world\u2019s tech capital: It birthed social networking and iPhones and spread those tech products across the globe. The rap on China has been that it always followed in the Valley\u2019s footsteps as government censorship abetted the rise of local versions of Google, YouTube and Twitter.But China\u2019s tech industry \u2014 particularly its mobile businesses \u2014 has in some ways pulled ahead of the United States. Some Western tech companies, even the behemoths, are turning to Chinese firms for ideas.\u201cWe just see China as further ahead,\u201d said Ted Livingston, the founder of Kik, which is headquartered in Waterloo, Ontario.The shift suggests that China could have a greater say in the global tech industry\u2019s direction. Already in China, more people use their mobile devices to pay their bills, order services, watch videos and find dates than anywhere else in the world. Mobile payments in the country last year surpassed those in the United States. By some estimates, loans from a new breed of informal online banks called peer-to-peer lenders did too.The future of online payments and engagements can be found at Liu Zheng\u2019s noodle shop in central Beijing. Liu Xiu\u2019e, 60, and her neighbor, Zhang Lixin, 55, read about the noodle shop on WeChat. Then they ordered and paid for their lunches and took and posted selfies of themselves outside the restaurant, all using the same app.Liu Zheng, who is not related to Liu Xiu\u2019e, said the automated ordering and payments meant he could cut down on wages for waiters. \u201cIn the future, we will only need one waiter to help in the restaurant and one to help with seating,\u201d Mr. Liu said.Before Venmo became the app for millennials to transfer money in the United States, both young and old in China were investing, reimbursing each other, paying bills,and buying products from stores with smartphone-based digital wallets.\u201cQuite frankly, the trope that China copies the U.S. hasn\u2019t been true for years, and in mobile it\u2019s the opposite: The U.S. often copies China,\u201d said Ben Thompson, the founder of the tech research firm Stratechery. \u201cFor the Facebook Messenger app, for example, the best way to understand their road map is to look at WeChat.\u201dA Facebook spokesman declined to comment. Tencent did not respond to requests for comment.Executives from companies like Facebook and smaller rivals like Kik are trying to replicate what has emerged in China: dominant online platforms where users will spend much of their time. Much of that effort is focused on chat.\u201cThe cool thing about chat is it becomes an operating system for your daily life,\u201d Mr. Livingston said. \u201cGoing up to a vending machine, ordering food, getting a cab: Chat can power those interactions, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing with WeChat.\u201dThe biggest advantage for China\u2019s tech industry, according to many analysts, is that it was able to fill a vacuum after the country essentially created much of its economy from scratch following the end of the Cultural Revolution, in 1976. Unlike in the United States, where banks and retailers already have strong holds on customers, China\u2019s state-run lenders are inefficient, and retailers never expanded broadly enough to serve a fast-growing middle class.Many Chinese also never bought a personal computer, meaning smartphones are the primary \u2014 and often first \u2014 computing device for the more than 600 million who have them in China.\u201cThe U.S. was first to credit cards, and everyone there has a personal computer. But China, where everyone is on their phones all the time, is now ahead in mobile commerce and mobile payments by virtue of leapfrogging the PC and credit cards,\u201d Mr. Thompson said.Chinese companies also approach the internet in a different way. In the United States, tech firms emphasize simplicity in their apps. But in China, its three major internet companies \u2014 Alibaba, Baidu and the WeChat parent Tencent \u2014 compete to create a single app with as many functions as they can stuff into it.On Alibaba\u2019s Taobao shopping app, people can also buy groceries, buy credits for online games, scan coupons and find deals at stores nearby. Baidu\u2019s mapping app lets users order an Uber, reserve a restaurant or hotel, order in food, buy movie tickets and find just about any type of store nearby.Tencent has opened up WeChat to other companies, allowing them to create apps within WeChat. Ebaoyang \u2014 a start-up that enables people to order oil changes for their cars directly on smartphones \u2014 was at first almost totally reliant on WeChat to attract business. Gao Feng, one of Ebaoyang\u2019s founders, said the company still relied on the app for 50 percent of its payments and 20 percent of new customers.\u201cWe started from WeChat. So it was our main, original source for getting customers,\u201d he said.Between fees for its services and money it makes through online games, WeChat manages to generate $7 in revenue per user each year, according to Nomura. The app has roughly 700 million users, more than the total number of smartphone users in China, in part because some users are outside the country and in part because people have multiple accounts.Much of that comes not from ads, as it might in the United States, but from spending on games, services and goods sold on the app. Those models may not translate from one market to the other, but the two can still borrow from each other, said Carmen Chang, a partner at the venture capital firm New Enterprise Associates.\u201cChina was able to develop a lot of innovative business models, which arose in a different kind of economy,\u201d said Ms. Chang, who spends time in both China and in Menlo Park, Calif. \u201cWhether or not we admit it here in Silicon Valley, it\u2019s had an impact on us and our thinking.\u201dCao Li in Beijing contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Russian Military Helicopter Is Shot Down in Syria, Killing 5", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 A Russian military transport helicopter was shot down on Monday in the Syrian province of Idlib, killing the three crew members and two officers on board in the deadliest episode for the Russian military since it intervened in the country, Russian officials said.Video footage, posted on Facebook by antigovernment activists shortly before the Russian Defense Ministry confirmed the attack, showed two burned bodies on the sand, about 300 feet from what appeared to be a helicopter in flames.In the video, a number of men, some of them armed, cheered around the bodies, shouting \u201cGod is great\u201d in Arabic. One of them jumped on a body, joyfully.A set of images, also released online, showed two Russian drivers\u2019 licenses \u2014 one belonging to a young woman, another to a young man \u2014 and a laminated Orthodox icon of God. It was not possible to establish the names of the people pictured on the licenses.Dmitri S. Peskov, a spokesman for the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, confirmed that all those on board had been killed, according to the Tass state news agency, and he expressed condolences to the victims\u2019 families.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which opposes the Syrian government and tracks the conflict from Britain through contacts in Syria, said the helicopter had crashed near the village of Saraqib in Idlib Province.The aircraft had recently delivered aid to two Shiite villages nearby that have long been surrounded by Sunni rebels, the group said.None of Syria\u2019s many rebel groups immediately claimed responsibility for shooting down the helicopter. But at a news briefing on Monday, Lt. Gen. Sergei F. Rudskoi, a senior member of the Russian general staff, said it had been shot down over territory controlled by the Nusra Front and \u201cthe so-called moderate opposition.\u201d He called the attack a \u201cterrorist act.\u201dLast week, Russia said it had established several humanitarian passages in Aleppo to let civilians and insurgents leave the area. So far, 324 civilians and 82 militants have left the city through them, General Rudskoi said. (Opposition groups in Syria have disputed these claims.)Citing the need to fight terrorists in faraway territories before they arrived in Russia, Mr. Putin began a military operation in Syria at the end of September in support of the government of President Bashar al-Assad.He ordered a partial withdrawal of Russian forces from Syria in March, but military operations continued, although at a lower intensity.A number of similar episodes have occurred over the course of Russia\u2019s involvement in the Syrian war.That episode provoked a standoff between Russia and Turkey, which ended with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan apologizing to Mr. Putin in July.After the downing of the Mi-25 in July, Russia sent Tu-22M3 bombers to hit Islamic State targets in the Syrian areas of Palmyra, Es-Suhne and Arak.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misidentified the source of reports that the helicopter was brought down by ground fire. The source was the Russian Defense Ministry, not a video posted by antigovernment activists. The error was repeated in a capsule summary.Ben Hubbard and Hwaida Saad contributed reporting from Beirut, Lebanon, and Maher Samaan from Paris.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Olympians in Hijab and Bikini", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "Supported bySince I saw a photograph of an Egyptian and a German beach volleyball player confronting each other at the net in Rio, I have been unable to get the image out of my head. Doaa Elghobashy, aged 19, wears a hijab, long sleeves and black leggings to her ankles. Kira Walkenhorst, 25, is in a dark blue bikini. The outstretched hands of the Olympian women almost meet, the ball between them.The photo, by Lucy Nicholson of Reuters, juxtaposes two women, two beliefs and two dress codes, brought together by sport. The world confronts less a clash of civilizations than a clash of identities, concertinaed in time and space by technology. The West\u2019s image of Islam and the Muslim image of Western societies are often mutually incommunicable; the incomprehension incubates violence.No area is as sensitive as that of the treatment of women, women\u2019s roles, women\u2019s sexuality, dress and ambitions. The story is often presented as one of Western emancipation versus Islamic subjugation. That, however, is an inadequate characterization.What follows are accounts by two women, an Egyptian and an American, of their experiences with the hijab. Chadiedja Buijs is a graduate student in Cairo. Norma Moore is a former actress living in Boulder, Colo., who recently visited Iran, where the rules obliged her to adopt Islamic dress codes.Chadiedja Buijs:My parents \u2014 Egyptian mother, Dutch father \u2014 separated when I was four, and I grew up in the Netherlands. My mom doesn\u2019t wear a head scarf and when I began to at the age of 19, five years ago, she said, \u201cWhat the hell are you doing? I left my country so that you could be free and this is what freedom did?\u201dI had a lot of issues with myself, with my spiritual needs and my state of being. I was very hardworking, very controlling. I began to feel that as a religious person I needed to realize that some things are bigger than me. I started with prayer. I stopped drinking. I began fasting. I\u2019d been so obsessed with material things. After a while I became convinced that it would be good if I could wear the head scarf out of devotion and humility, as a sign of giving up some of my control. It worked.Our Prophet says faith is like the ocean. Sometimes the waves are high, sometimes low. Sometimes I am shaky in my faith, sometimes very strong.The hijab is a matter of representation. I know the person I am and the ideas I have. But the person in front of me sees only the exterior. With the tension in Europe, things are worse. In a Dutch village, in a caf\u00e9 full of rich white people, a man tore my veil off. It was shocking but not as frustrating as some of the looks and comments, the job rejections (\u201cYou do not fit the image of our store\u201d).After the attacks in France, my mother said, \u201cPlease take your veil off.\u201d It is my choice to wear it. I will die with it on. That is my right. Nobody will take it away.But balance is important. There is this life and the afterlife. Sometimes you need to think about your spirituality. Sometimes you need to adapt. In the West, now, I may wear tighter jeans, or have my neck showing, or use short sleeves. Here in Egypt I may wear maxi-skirts, long and wide. They do not look great. They make me fat. But, hey, that\u2019s the point! My family here is quite conservative.There is very little religious literacy in secular Western countries. And there is a crisis within Islam, over what it means to be a Muslim. As Muslims we have to acknowledge the problem. ISIS controls what Islam looks like in Iraq and Syria \u2014 religious symbolism, flags, statements and verses. This is real. We cannot deny it. But we create extremism by talking about Islam only through this prism. The head scarf becomes a fetish.Elghobashy is wearing leggings in the photo. I think she represents people like me. International-minded, young, modern Muslims who want to go out and study and work and play. We need different images of Islam.I got different responses from men when I chose to wear a head scarf rather than a short skirt. It created a kind of distance. But I still have my sexuality in my own hands. I can be very flirtatious, go out and meet a man \u2014 but I decide in what mode I want to be. I can be focused on my spirituality, prayers and study without distraction, or I can have a period when I choose to be sexy even in a head scarf through how I act or speak. I feel I have more power and independence vis-\u00e0-vis men now.Norma Moore:I am a deeply religious person. I don\u2019t have a label to attach to my faith, but it is there nonetheless at the core of my being. I believe that God created me and created me with love as I am \u2014 just as God creates every other person. When I put on the hijab in Iran and the shapeless tunics I experience an attempt to deny how I have been made \u2014 an attempt to neutralize me.It has made me afraid. I started this trip almost completely covered by my hijab. Before coming I practiced with the help of an internet video so that no trace of hair or neck or calf would show and make me vulnerable to stares or the humiliation of being chastised. I had come here voluntarily and accepted the terms of admission, so I began the trip in a willing state of submission.But then the weather got hot \u2014 very hot. I got overheated and all I could think about was tearing this hijab off. I felt suffocated. I thought how I wouldn\u2019t let an animal suffocate like this. If my animal were covered like this and suffering I would tear the fabric off out of simple decency.My hair, the curves in my body, were given to me by God. To cover my head and wear shapeless clothes feels like I am pretending not to be a woman and that somehow I am responsible for keeping men\u2019s sexuality within social bounds.I just can\u2019t wrap my head around God making me responsible for men\u2019s sexuality.The Olympics volleyball photograph is tantalizing. The few inches between the women\u2019s hands may as well be a chasm. More than once I have heard Iranian imams, with preposterous certainty, equate flimsy women\u2019s attire in the West with decadence and prostitution. To Western sensibilities, the covered Muslim woman must de facto be the disempowered woman awaiting liberation.Reality is many-shaded. Elghobashy wears an anklet of colored beads. The only colors on Walkenhorst are those of the German flag. Who is to say which of the women is more conservative, more of a feminist or more liberated? We do not know. What we do know is that we need more events that provoke us to ask such questions and discard tired certainties that may be no more than dangerous caricatures.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Streaming the News", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetterTo the Editor:There is something very troubling about the prospect that Facebook Live or Periscope, Twitter\u2019s live service, will replace the venerable institution of news. These snippets may be live, but they conflate live information with news, and streaming as-it-happens video with truth.A live collection of videos reflects the perspective of the person streaming the video, and its truth value is a function of how that person positions the camera, what he or she displays, what is left out and what occurred before the incident that critically influenced the images that are shown.This is particularly problematic in the case of streaming videos of highly charged incidents, like police violence against civilians, where the person taking pictures may have strong views that determine the images that are transmitted.To the extent that Facebook or Twitter users infer that the streamed images reflect reality, the new news is as problematic as the breaking news of cable of yore, which in its prime also elicited perceptions of truth rather than nuanced appreciation of the limitations in news.RICHARD M.

{"Headline": "Relaxing Privacy Vow, WhatsApp Will Share Some Data With Facebook", "Date": "2016-08-25", "News": "Supported byTwo years later, in a move that is rankling some of the company\u2019s more than one billion users, WhatsApp will soon begin to share some member information with Facebook.WhatsApp said on Thursday that it would start disclosing the phone numbers and analytics data of its users to Facebook. It will be the first time the messaging service has connected users\u2019 accounts to the social network to share data, as Facebook tries to coordinate information across its collection of businesses.Among the changes, Facebook will be able to use a person\u2019s phone number to improve other Facebook-operated services, such as making new Facebook friend suggestions, or better-tailored advertising, WhatsApp added. It said the data-sharing would also be used to fight spam text messages across its service.While WhatsApp operates autonomously from Facebook, Mr. Koum sits on Facebook\u2019s board.The changes were immediately viewed with a critical eye by some who were concerned when Facebook bought WhatsApp that their data could one day be misused. WhatsApp made early inroads with people worldwide partly for its hard-line stance on privacy and individual liberties, which was rooted in Mr. Koum\u2019s youth in the 1980s in the Soviet Union, where, he has said, he lived in fear of his communications being monitored. Mr. Koum has also been outspoken against advertising in the app in general.Many WhatsApp users have appreciated just how different the service is from Facebook. In some countries, like Brazil, WhatsApp\u2019s focus on privacy has led to criticism from law enforcement agencies that they cannot gain access to users\u2019 encrypted messages.\u201cOur values and our respect for your privacy continue to guide the decisions we make at WhatsApp,\u201d Mr. Koum said in a post on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s why we\u2019ve rolled out end-to-end encryption, which means no one can read your messages other than the people you talk to. Not us, not Facebook, nor anyone else.\u201dHe added, \u201cOur focus is the same as it\u2019s always been \u2014 giving you a fast, simple and reliable way to stay in touch with friends and loved ones around the world.\u201dWhatsApp\u2019s privacy policy overhaul raises concerns about potential legal challenges. Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a privacy advocacy group in Washington, said it would file a complaint on Monday with the Federal Trade Commission to stop WhatsApp from sharing users\u2019 data with Facebook. The group filed a similar case in 2014, citing promises that WhatsApp had made to protect individuals\u2019 privacy.\u201cMany users signed up for WhatsApp and not Facebook, precisely because WhatsApp offered, at the time, better privacy practices,\u201d Mr. Rotenberg said by email. \u201cIf the F.T.C. does not bring an enforcement action, it means that even when users choose better privacy services, there is no guarantee their data will be protected.\u201dFacebook has also been at the heart of a debate over how people\u2019s information held in Europe \u2014 the company\u2019s users outside the United States are regulated from Dublin \u2014 should be transferred to the United States.WhatsApp\u2019s new privacy policy may put it in the middle of this tussle, pushing the company to reassure concerned users about how Facebook may use their data.Mike Isaac reported from San Francisco and Mark Scott from Rome.Advertisement"}

When a fire started late Tuesday night in the maternity wing of one of Baghdad\u2019s main hospitals, it quickly engulfed the babies\u2019 room. And then, in another Iraqi tragedy in a horrifying line of preventable ones, nothing worked.Hospital workers raced to save the infants, but no one could find the keys to unlock the nursery. Inexplicably, no nurses seemed to be inside. Apparently, none of the fire extinguishers functioned. It took nearly an hour and a half for firefighters to arrive.Some thought the initial cause may have been an oxygen tank explosion that set off an electrical fire. But on Wednesday morning, only one thing was certain: At least 13 infants were dead, and with them a small piece of Iraq\u2019s future.There was Yaman Muaad, a baby boy born by cesarean section on Tuesday who died a few hours later. There was Jafar Kahtan, a baby being treated for breathing difficulties. There was Zahra Hussein, a baby girl born on Monday, whose grandfather was frantically looking for her on Wednesday.Many more were still unaccounted for. And at least 25 people, mostly infants, were being treated for burns or smoke inhalation.All Iraqi officials could manage was what they typically do in the face of tragedy: establish a committee.\u201cA committee has been formed to investigate the incident, and so far we don\u2019t know the reasons of the incident,\u201d Dr. Ahmed al-Hadari, a spokesman for the Health Ministry, said at a news conference on Wednesday. \u201cWe are awaiting the results of the investigations.\u201dAfter years of unsolved tragedy and unanswered demands for improvements, hardly anyone here believes official promises anymore.\u201cSuch tragedies have become normal to Iraqi officials, and this case will be closed, just as the other ones,\u201d said Adnan Hussein, the acting editor in chief at Al Mada, one of Baghdad\u2019s daily newspapers.In their agony and tears as they gathered outside Yarmouk hospital on Wednesday morning, families of the dead babies were inconsolable. Some even made accusations of arson, though there was no evidence to support that claim.\u201cThere was screaming,\u201d said Mariam Thijeel, the mother of Yaman, describing the scene at the hospital early Wednesday. \u201cThe power was cut off, and then the doors got locked on us, and there was no man in the newborn section, and we could not save any babies.\u201dShe described a scene of panic and chaos, and said that people in the hospital had tried desperately to find someone with keys to the hospital wing that was on fire, the doors of which were locked. \u201cWe asked the help of one of the employees, but she said, \u2018I cannot help you with anything, because it\u2019s a fire,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Thijeel said.Zainab Ali, Jafar\u2019s mother, said: \u201cToday I have come to see him and I was told, \u2018A fire happened in the newborn unit, and your baby died.\u2019\u201d She said she had heard that none of the fire extinguishers worked.A third mother, Shayma Husain, came to the hospital looking for her infant son, Haider Mohammad Azeez, who had not been accounted for. Angry and tearful, she compared the leaders of the government-run hospital to the militants of the Islamic State \u2014 saying, in effect, that politicians and terrorists were both responsible for Iraq\u2019s endless trauma.Many Iraqis say the state\u2019s dysfunction is caused by a political system the Americans helped establish that is based on sectarian quotas. People are given jobs in ministries based on patronage and sect, not competence, and corruption is rampant.\u201cWe have good medical competence and good doctors, but there are problems and defects in the state administration,\u201d Mr. Saadawi said. \u201cThey always put the wrong people in the important places.\u201dIn that attack, many more died from the fire than from the bomb blast, and in the aftermath officials blamed poor safety procedures and a lack of fire exits for the number of deaths.Like the bombing, the fire at the hospital would probably have been less deadly had the government put in place adequate safety measures or responded sooner.\u201cI was at the incident today and saw the disaster with my own eyes,\u201d said Mohammed al-Rubaie, a member of the security committee on Baghdad\u2019s provincial council. \u201cThere was clear negligence from the administration of the hospital, and there were no safety measures.\u201dThere were no protests in Baghdad on Wednesday as there were after last month\u2019s terrorist attack, only muted outrage and a tragic sense of familiarity.He added, \u201cOh my God, what a big crime today.\u201dThere was also the usual violence on Tuesday and Wednesday, the sort that has long been a feature of the city\u2019s routines. According to the Interior Ministry, a suicide car bombing at a checkpoint in the neighborhood of Dora killed four soldiers and injured 11 people; a roadside bomb killed four people at a public market in the Nahrawan district; and a suicide bomber killed four soldiers in the Rasheed district.As Mr. Hussein, the newspaper editor, put it: There is \u201cno safe place in Iraq at all.\u201dFalih Hassan and Omar Al-Jawoshy reported from Baghdad, and Tim Arango from Istanbul.Advertisement"}

The need to do six Dior collections a year was seen as a millstone around the neck of creativity.Though this transferred power from the designers to the brand, and Calvin Klein remained a commercial force, its aesthetic identity and influence were greatly diminished.Most attempts to make a statement, like a recent ad campaign featuring Justin Bieber and Kendall Jenner, were more a retread of old ideas (Marky Mark and Kate Moss) than a contemporary vision.Mr. Simons will \u201coversee all aspects of design, global marketing and communications, and visual creative services,\u201d the company said. And his long-term collaborator, Pieter Mulier, was named Calvin Klein\u2019s creative director.A fashion world favorite and trained industrial designer who in 1995 started a men\u2019s wear line that bears his name, Mr. Simons began his career in women\u2019s wear as creative director of Jil Sander. He moved quickly to put his own modernist stamp on that brand, before joining Dior and doing the same in 2012. He is known for an intellectual, architectural approach to form.His appointment at Calvin Klein is an acknowledgment of the need for a defining, and unifying, creative point of view for a brand, no matter how large. In a time of geopolitical unrest and challenged consumption patterns, a line must stand for something to stand out. That will be Mr. Simons\u2019s charge.If he can achieve it, he will help refocus New York fashion, which has been in something of a creative vacuum in recent years, casting about for a post-sportswear identity.It is an enormous opportunity, and an enormous challenge. Not the kind of challenge that a designer who is searching for more time to smell the daisies would take on \u2014 especially given the fact that Mr. Simons, who has relocated to New York from Antwerp, Belgium, will continue to design his own men\u2019s line at the same time.The fact that Mr. Simons has stepped in to this role at Calvin Klein suggests that perhaps his departure from Dior had more to do with the limitations he found in that job (his responsibility was limited to women\u2019s wear and accessories) than with any design pressure. And that it is not the creative demands the fashion industry places on its designers that is creating unrest in the industry, but rather the continuing power struggle between brand and individual.The first test will come next year, when Mr. Simons presents his men\u2019s and women\u2019s fall collections for Calvin Klein.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Are Final Clubs Too Exclusive for Harvard?", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "Supported byOne midnight near semester\u2019s end on the skirts of Harvard Yard, music thumped and laughs rang out from a colonnaded, Greek-revival mansion, the sort usually seen in Hollywood fantasies about fraternal campus life. But it was the scene outside that suggested something other than a frat party. This was the headquarters of the Fly, an exclusive men\u2019s fellowship known here as a final club. At its side door stood a silver-haired man in tuxedo, checking names against a list of the lucky invited. Eager young women in micro-minis queued up.Except one. A lone girl sat on the front steps, bathed by yellow light spilling from windows in which the silhouettes of revelers held pool cues and beer bottles. She was hunched over, legs flopped on either side, face in hands. She had managed to get in but was \u201ckicked out,\u201d she wailed into a phone pressed against her ear. Her cheeks were reddened, streaked with mascara.Now, she sobbed, \u201cthey won\u2019t let me in!\u201dA group of young men stood in the doorway, hands shoved in pockets, chatting. Every so often they cast an awkward glance at the young woman.The Fly is one of six remaining all-male final clubs. They are, if not the hub, the apex of social life at Harvard \u2014 upscale surrogates for those classic centers of college merriment, sororities and fraternities.On any given weekend, a string of young women spools out onto Mount Auburn Street in front of one or another of the club porticos. And while there might be legitimate reasons to exclude them, from intoxication to overcrowding, the crying woman on the stairs underscored the power the final clubs have over the student psyche. Entree can feel like belonging, rejection like a scarlet F.Some students describe final clubs as nothing more than fun outlets on a campus with few options for unsupervised play. To those who join they offer a close-knit group of friends and a refuge from the high pressure of the Harvard course load. After graduation, members enjoy access to an extensive alumni network.To many students, the clubs remain potent symbols of privilege, anachronistic and out of place on an increasingly diverse campus.These clashing perceptions have roiled the community over the past year, with the administration falling squarely into the camp that final clubs and all they represent, wittingly or not, do not belong at Harvard. It is a long-held stance that has resulted in periodic action by the university \u2014 and counterpunches by the clubs.The decision stands to have ramifications beyond Cambridge, Mass., by ratifying a movement that is taking hold across the country: to make student social life more inclusive.In an interview a few days after graduation, Dr. Khurana softened his rhetoric. \u201cIt\u2019s not our intention to make the students feel persecuted,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to just say to our students: The issue is not our students. I think they are people of immense character and integrity. We are trying to create the conditions to allow our students to become the kind of people they say they want to become in their admissions essays.\u201dThe push to end, or at least reform, final clubs is also informed by the urgent discussion nationwide of sexual assault on campus. A 2015 survey of several universities by the Association of American Universities found that by the time they were seniors, 47 percent of Harvard women who had participated in final club activities had experienced unwanted sexual touch, compared with 31 percent schoolwide.Richard T. Porteus, class of \u201978 and president of the Fly\u2019s graduate body, is one of the few final club members to publicly challenge the college. \u201cIf Harvard really were to become serious about preventing sexual assault rather than using it as a way to push an ideological stance,\u201d he told me, \u201cthey\u2019d drill down to find out exactly what is occurring rather than trying to throw a moral pall over any man or women who belongs to these clubs.\u201dTo charges that the men cast themselves in the role of patriarchal gatekeeper, Mr. Porteus made a pragmatic argument: The clubhouses have limited capacity, and invitation-only protects members and guests, particularly women. And the doorkeeper, a part-time staff member and parent of a college student, can assess the sobriety of guests, entering and departing.In a stab at the dean, he concluded: \u201cWhat is more patriarchal than an older male authority figure deciding for young women where and how they should spend their personal time when off-campus?\u201dThe clubs have adamantly defied demands to become coeducational not for exclusivity\u2019s sake, Mr. Porteus said, but out of a belief that what a single-gender space offers is of deep value. \u201cWhether you\u2019re a man or a woman or you identify in any other way, you\u2019re curious to learn from others of the gender you identify with,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why single-gender entities exist, from Wellesley College to the Boy Scouts of America.\u201d\u201cIt is not,\u201d he said, \u201ca rejection of anyone.\u201d\u2022Up the stairwell is a gallery of memories \u2014 photos of famous members like Franklin Delano Roosevelt and members killed in war \u2014 leading to the trophy room. This is a space clearly created by young men for young men. Animal busts decorate the walls. There are large speakers for music. Billiard tables have been topped with glass, good for table tennis and beer pong.\u201cEach is unique in its policy and procedures,\u201d said Mr. Porteus, a charter school founder. \u201cThe clubs do not act in concert, seldom and sporadically share information, and in many respects are rivals. Dean Khurana is describing all clubs as though they were the same.\u201dAn alumnus, or graduate member, agreed to talk about the lasting meaning the Porc has for its members. He described how quaint bonding activities, like all-male black-tie dinners in which members perform club songs and tell stories from its history, forged lasting friendships. Lunch is taken together almost every day in the club. After graduation, dinners are held monthly, worldwide, allowing far-flung alumni to retain those friendships.Because of the club\u2019s policy of secrecy, which harks back hundreds of years, the member would speak only on condition he not be named \u2014 and in a conversation monitored by a public relations representative who periodically told him he was saying too much and to stop talking.History is venerated, and he was eager to tell how it is passed down through the many artworks and objets d\u2019art housed in its clubhouse, including thousands of renderings of boars, its emblem. Alexander Calder, a rare exception to the nonvisitor policy, was so taken with the place, the story goes, that he gifted a sculpture depicting two mating boars; it was once lent to the Whitney Museum of American Art for a retrospective. Far from fraternity hazing, Porc initiation rites include memorizing and reciting each item\u2019s provenance and meaning in pop quizzes.The Porcellian is considering becoming coed, the member said. \u201cEven though it\u2019s the oldest club, it\u2019s not blindly and foolishly wedded to a certain way of being,\u201d he said. \u201cThe club, in order to stay relevant for its members, needs to continue to evolve.\u201d What it is rejecting is being forced by outside parties to do so \u2014 and instantly.If the groups were to bend and turn coed, whatever it is they do behind their stately doors and Corinthian columns could continue. Last year, a few relented: The Spee and Fox admitted women, though in response to alumni backlash the Fox\u2019s were provisional members.Contrary to the patrician conception of the club, the graduate member said, the current new class, though under a dozen, as is typical, is diverse, including several students of color as well as foreign students. Yet the clubs are stymied by both their image problem and closelipped policies. He understood that conundrum: \u201cWe recognize that as an all-male club, and particularly as the oldest all-male club, even if you take the time to learn about our traditions, our quirky weird traditions, we are just not a sympathetic figure and never will be in the public eye.\u201d\u2022But instead of breaking down barriers, more single-gender organizations emerged. In the early \u201990s, the first female-only final clubs and sororities arose.\u201cWe had often found ourselves on the steps of a final club trying to get into a party and being chosen or not chosen by these men, who own this real estate,\u201d Eugenia B. Schraa Huh, a founder of the women-only Sabli\u00e8re Society, told me. \u201cThere was this feeling of us being powerless on the social scene. We absolutely founded the club to help correct a power imbalance at Harvard.\u201dBut parity has remained elusive. The women\u2019s clubs have their own level of exclusivity, and their social role is limited because many of them do not have dedicated spaces (some partner with men\u2019s clubs for parties, or co-host dinners \u2014 at the Fly, for example, with wine served from its cellar). The rub with the new rules is that they apply to all single-gender clubs.Caroline Tervo, a member of the Pleiades Society (a women\u2019s club named for the \u201cseven sisters\u201d star cluster), addressed the crowd before the march: \u201cGender discrimination happens every day. It happens in the classroom, when men are called on more often; in the workplace, when men are paid more; and on the weekend, when women are targeted and shamed for their sexuality. On a campus and in a society that is still so male dominated, female spaces are necessary sources of empowerment.\u201dOn the day sanctions were announced, women in Greek-lettered T-shirts huddled in urgent discussion around campus. On Facebook, fraternity and sorority members changed their profile pictures to their organization\u2019s insignia in solidarity. Many want final clubs to change but believe that by including other groups the university painted with too broad a brush.\u201cThere is a lot of value in targeting some of the exclusionary aspects of the final clubs, and making sure we are working toward the same goals collectively,\u201d said Rebecca Ramos, a rising senior and president of the Delta Gamma chapter, one of the Greek organizations that took root here in the early \u201990s. But, she told me, \u201cThe administration has tried to target the entire single sex-social organization scene in one fell swoop, as opposed to targeting certain organizations that don\u2019t align with the values expressed by the mission of Harvard College.\u201dShe said that sisters of her sorority, which is open to all women, including transgender women, act as guardians of one another\u2019s mental health, watching for signs of emotional distress and coming to their aid to share coping mechanisms or just hugs. \u201cWe\u2019ve been emotional support throughout many difficult times for our sisters,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are really concerned about losing that on campus. Harvard can be a really difficult place to be.\u201dIt is a place where social pressure is palpable. Several dozen students refused to discuss final clubs on the record. One, rushing across campus in a seersucker suit on his way to a Kentucky Derby-watching party, summed up the sentiment of many when he said that if you have an opinion that might offend someone, keep it to yourself. Even detractors feared being dropped from a final club\u2019s party rolls. Some worried they would be blacklisted from certain professions after graduation if a powerful club alumnus got wind of any criticism. Several students were afraid they would not be able to get a job in academia, or of getting bad grades, if they criticized Harvard.Ana Andrade, a freshman folded into a chair in the center of Harvard Yard between final exams, felt emboldened enough to comment on the clubs\u2019 social impact. Particularly galling for her are the mechanics of a final club party, where women, dressed to impress, show up hoping to be picked from the crowd and invited in. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the patriarchy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s perpetuated right there.\u201dThe process, she noted, has an Ivy League twist: Women are not measured merely by the velvet-rope yardstick of physical beauty. A \u201cHarvard 10,\u201d she explained, is a mix of intellect, social status and academic je ne sais quoi. Yet the idea that men determine women\u2019s worth, she said, made her too uncomfortable to participate.Amir Khan, a 23-year-old student at a local community college, has borne uneasy witness to young men as the gatekeepers of Harvard social life. He drives a cab at night, and regularly picks up profoundly inebriated women from outside final clubs. \u201cYou give them power and they think that everyone has to kneel down to them,\u201d Mr. Khan said of the club members. \u201cEven with girls, that\u2019s how they look at it. They get to pick; it\u2019s their choice. You let these kids grow up like this and they\u2019ll have this mentality for the rest of their lives.\u201d\u201cBy the same logic,\u201d he pointed out, \u201cin another year or by another dean, members of the Chilton Club, of the D.A.R., or of a political party advocating Muslim exclusion might also be considered deficient relative to Harvard\u2019s standards of nondiscrimination.\u201dRobert Shibley, executive director of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, an organization that defends freedom of speech on college campuses, likened the sanctions to a blacklist. \u201cIt is solely up to arbitrary judgment of the authorities as to who is no longer savory enough,\u201d he told me. \u201cIn the \u201950s that would have been the Communist Party. Once you start using that as a reason to disqualify, there is no principled place to stop.\u201d\u201cWhen you don\u2019t have an equal opportunity for people of different points of views to participate in what\u2019s supposed to be a marketplace of ideas,\u201d Mr. Shibley said, \u201cyou\u2019re impoverishing that education.\u201dOn Mount Auburn Street, defense of the clubs is more visceral. It was a spring night at the Phoenix S.K. Club, and young women were swiftly waved in, known so well they exchanged double-cheeked kisses with the doorkeeper. Inside, they danced under crystal chandeliers beside art depicting Revolutionary War soldiers.As students swayed to a live band, a young man picked up a microphone. \u201cEverybody say hi to Dean Khurana, he\u2019s in the back!\u201d he yelled.The name drew curses from the dance floor.\u2022Harvard is but the most prestigious wave in an ocean of unrest on college campuses regarding single-gender extracurricular groups. With fraternities caught up in allegations of sexual misconduct across the country, the movement to abolish them has gained momentum. In 2014, Wesleyan University ruled that its small group of residential fraternities must integrate women. Greek organizations have been banned altogether from Amherst College. Middlebury College has replaced them with mixed-gender \u201csocial houses.\u201dStudies underscore the connection between binge drinking, assault and Greek life. A 2007 study by John D. Foubert, a professor of higher education at Oklahoma State University, found that members of frats have three times the likelihood of committing rape as nonmembers. But whether abolishing male organizations improves the environment for women remains to be seen.\u201cThere are lots of questions we don\u2019t have research about,\u201d Dr. Foubert said. Good metrics are hard to come by: A rise in sexual assault complaints can be a good sign \u2014 \u201cthe women trust the institution more,\u201d he said \u2014 and \u201ckids can drink alcohol in any setting undetected.\u201dSome experts worry that bad behavior would just move underground.Despite the turmoil, nothing seismic happened when the Fox went coed, according to one member interviewed outside the clubhouse. (He would not give his full name because the club forbids members to speak to the news media.) \u201cPeople were worried that, \u2018Oh, we can\u2019t act the same way, we can\u2019t act up,\u2019\u2009\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see it changing. I think it\u2019s a cool experience with having a different perspective in the club.\u201dSome fear what their commitment to such clubs will mean for their future. Mitchell York briefly questioned his hope to punch this year when, as a sophomore, he\u2019ll be eligible. But the promise of lifelong friends outweighed any hesitation. It even trumped the specter of reprisal, and any anxiety of being associated with a club at the cross hairs of a conversation about sexual assault.That\u2019s because the solution, Mr. York believes, lies in the club members themselves. \u201cI know that I would never have an issue with what the final clubs are accused of,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople who are joining, and people who are in them currently, have to take on the responsibility to make sure that these things don\u2019t happen.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Page 16 this weekend about Harvard final clubs misstates the academic degree held by Richard T. Porteus, president of the Fly Club\u2019s graduate body. He has a bachelors in English and American literature and language, not a master\u2019s in education.Sarah Maslin Nir is a reporter for The Times and a 2016 Pulitzer Prize finalist for \u201cUnvarnished,\u201d an investigation of the nail salon industry.

{"Headline": "Concerns Over Rule Banning Sex Offenders From Playing Pok\u00e9mon Go", "Date": "2016-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe list that most sex offenders must sign in order to be granted parole in New York State includes many stipulations, all written in the first person. There are promises to register with local law enforcement, to complete therapy if it is required and to not pick up hitchhikers or visit schools or playgrounds.And at the end there is a new entry: no Pok\u00e9mon Go.\u201cI understand that I shall not download, access, or otherwise engage in any internet-enabled gaming activities to include Pok\u00e9mon Go,\u201d it reads.The appearance of the popular smartphone game \u2014 in which players catch Pok\u00e9mon, digital creatures with names such as Squirtle and Jigglypuff \u2014 on the gloomy bureaucratic document was not a joke or a prank. It was a serious policy enacted by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, this month to protect children who play games over the internet.But advocates for civil liberties said they were skeptical of whether the new stipulation, which would apply to about 3,000 paroled sex offenders in the state, was appropriate.Pok\u00e9mon Go takes the form of a treasure hunt, with a digital map on a cellphone leading a player to real locations \u2014 many of them landmarks \u2014 to try to collect Pok\u00e9mon characters. The augmented reality game splices a digital layer onto the physical world: Pok\u00e9mon appear based on a player\u2019s physical location, and the cartoon creatures are seen through the phone\u2019s camera, creating an image that melds the virtual to the real \u2014 a smiley Bulbasaur near a Central Park fountain, for example.But to State Senators Jeffrey D. Klein and Diane J. Savino, both Democrats, it presented \u201ca virtual road map to our children,\u201d Mr. Klein said in a news release. In an informal investigation, they looked at 100 addresses of registered sex offenders across New York City and found Pok\u00e9mon near 57 of them. And they highlighted an instance in Indiana in which a sex offender was reportedly caught playing the game with a 16-year-old.Mr. Cuomo, in a statement explaining that the order was inspired by the investigation, said, \u201cThese actions will provide safeguards\u201d and \u201chelp take one more tool away from those seeking to do harm to our children.\u201dMr. Cuomo\u2019s office said that the game\u2019s \u201clure\u201d feature, which allows players to attract more Pok\u00e9mon to certain locations, \u201cappears to have the potential to be abused by predators.\u201dStill, Alphonso David, the governor\u2019s chief counsel, said, \u201cWhat we can\u2019t do is suggest that a percentage of children \u2014 even if it\u2019s a small percentage of children \u2014 can\u2019t be protected.\u201dThe list of so-called special conditions to which Pok\u00e9mon Go was added includes prohibitions on parolees owning cameras or cellphones, using the internet or driving anywhere besides work. If parolees, who are subject to unscheduled searches of their home and devices, break any of these provisions, they could end up back in prison. Parole officers can grant dispensation on some of the conditions case by case.\u201cI think that the anonymity of apps like Kik, Snapchat, Instagram and Pok\u00e9mon Go does increase the risk for opportunistic offenders,\u201d she said.Finn Brunton, an assistant professor of media at New York University, described the game as part of a wave of new technology that is breaking down the boundary between real and virtual worlds in unpredictable ways. \u201cCyberspace \u2014 you think of it being this other place, but it\u2019s not that at all anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s the world that surrounds us.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How #BlackLivesMatter Came to Define a Movement", "Date": "2016-08-22", "News": "Supported byIt had existed as a phrase for some time, but it wasn\u2019t until two black men died in the summer of 2014 that Black Lives Matter began to flicker to life as a Twitter hashtag.The hashtag had a small, but sustained increase in use in the summer of 2014, when Michael Brown and Eric Garner died in encounters with the police, focusing a national discussion on race and policing and elevating a phrase that would define a movement.\u201cThis is a very powerful example of how a hashtag now is attached to a movement, and a movement, in some ways, has grown around a hashtag \u2014 and a series of really painful and really powerful conversations are taking place in a brand-new space,\u201d said Lee Rainie, director of internet, science and technology research at Pew.The label appears to have lasting power, simmering like a low-grade fever on social media and roaring to life with every police killing of a black citizen and every racial protest that makes the news, informing the long-running national debate.In the report on race and social media, Mr. Rainie and his colleagues, led by Monica Anderson and Paul Hitlin, retraced the rise of #BlackLivesMatter and #AllLivesMatter over a period of nearly 1,000 days, from July 12, 2013, to March 31, 2016.The #AllLivesMatter hashtag generally tracked the ups and downs of its counterpart, but at a small fraction of the intensity, as shown in the chart below, based on the Pew data obtained using the social analytics software Crimson Hexagon.Those events coincided with a lasting spike in the mentions of #BlackLivesMatter. In the three months leading up to Nov. 25, 2014, the hashtag averaged fewer than 1,500 daily mentions. In the three months after, it averaged more than 30,000.The Pew study cut off at the end of March of this year, but the team behind the report later conducted a supplemental analysis covering two weeks in July when two black men were separately killed by police and eight police officers were killed in a pair of targeted attacks.What they found was a tremendous surge in the mentions of #BlackLivesMatter and #AllLivesMatter.By July 8, the hashtag soared to more than 1.1 million mentions. On that same day, #AllLivesMatter appeared 189,000 times on Twitter \u2014 matching the record for #BlackLivesMatter during the entire earlier thousand-day study period.The July flurry of activity is notable not only for the level of discussion around the hashtag, but also for how the tone of the conversation changed, according to Pew.Over the course of the 1,000-day study period, 38 percent of #BlackLivesMatter mentions were positive, compared with 11 percent negative, according to a Pew sentiment analysis. The hashtag was used neutrally 12 percent of the time. (The remaining references fell into an \u201cother\u201d category.)And in the days leading up to the Dallas shooting, the tone was even more supportive: 87 percent of posts mentioning #BlackLivesMatter did so in a positive light, with just 11 percent of mentions appearing negative from July 5 to July 7.But that quickly and drastically shifted, with support falling to 28 percent and opposition rising to 39 percent in the 10 days after the Dallas shooting.\u201cWe really saw that shift overnight,\u201d Ms. Anderson said. \u201cIt really shows you where current events can drive the conversation on social media and also change the tenor of conversation there, as well.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Aetna to Pull Back From Public Health Care Exchanges", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In a blow to President Obama\u2019s health care law, Aetna, one of the nation\u2019s major insurers, said Monday that it would sharply reduce its participation in the law\u2019s public marketplaces next year.Aetna said it would no longer offer individual insurance products on the exchanges in about two-thirds of the 778 counties where it now provides such coverage. The company will maintain a presence on exchanges in Delaware, Iowa, Nebraska and Virginia, it said.The exchanges are a centerpiece of the Affordable Care Act: the only place where consumers can obtain subsidies to buy health insurance, which most Americans are required to have under the 2010 law. About 11 million consumers have coverage through the marketplaces, and about 85 percent of them receive subsidies in the form of tax credits.Mark T. Bertolini, the chairman and chief executive of Aetna, said the company was responding to financial losses: \u201ca second-quarter pretax loss of $200 million and total pretax losses of more than $430 million since January 2014 in our individual products.\u201d\u201cAs a strong supporter of public exchanges as a means to meet the needs of the uninsured, we regret having to make this decision,\u201d Mr. Bertolini said. But, he added, the company cannot provide affordable, high-quality plans through the exchanges without a larger number of healthy people to help offset the costs of coverage for less healthy consumers.\u201cIndividuals in need of high-cost care\u201d account for a disproportionate share of the enrollment in Aetna\u2019s marketplace plans, and the federal government does not adequately adjust its payments to account for these costs, he said.Kevin J. Counihan, the chief executive of the federal insurance exchange, said the marketplace would remain strong and vibrant despite Aetna\u2019s decision.\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that companies are adapting at different rates to a market where they compete for business on cost and quality, rather than by denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions,\u201d Mr. Counihan said Monday.In a conference call with securities analysts in April, Mr. Bertolini said that Aetna had 911,000 members with individual coverage through the exchanges and added, \u201cWe see this as a good investment.\u201dSenator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, said she saw a possible connection between the antitrust case against Aetna and its decision to reconsider participating in the exchanges.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Transgender on the Force", "Date": "2016-08-05", "News": "Supported byAfter years of focused preparation, Aiden Budd was well on his way to fulfilling his lifelong dream of becoming an officer in the New York Police Department. He had served in the United States Army and had worked for years as an agent in the department\u2019s School Safety division. He studied for the exam to be promoted and he passed.He was set to start at the Police Academy on July 7, 2015.But first, there was something else he felt he had to accomplish. When he became a recruit, he wanted to be recognized officially as Aiden Budd, male police officer \u2014 settling, at least legally, a question of identity he had struggled with since he was a child.He had grown up as a girl in the Wakefield neighborhood in the Bronx, the oldest of three children in a West Indian family. He could tell early on that something did not feel right. It went beyond being a tomboy, the one student in his all-girls Catholic high school who refused to wear a skirt, even though it meant detention almost every day. Even after he came out to his family as a lesbian in high school, he felt an overwhelming discontent that continued into adulthood, poisoning his personal relationships.\u201cI couldn\u2019t find happiness with myself,\u201d Officer Budd, now 33, said. \u201cThere was something missing.\u201dHe had to come out again. He was transgender, and about a year before he started at the academy, a time of exams and interviews and extensive digging into his background, he began his transition to physically becoming a man. \u201cI\u2019ll put it like this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a rebirth.\u201dHe knew his decision had the potential to jeopardize his relationship with his family, one that had been strained since he came out the first time. And as he followed his uncle, a father figure, into law enforcement, Officer Budd feared that his identity would keep him from being accepted into the fraternity of police officers.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be judged before they got to know me as a person,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be a science project.\u201dStill, he pushed ahead.\u201cWe look at the individual for who they are,\u201d said Deputy Inspector Joseph Simonetti, the commanding officer of the Sixth Precinct, which covers Greenwich Village. \u201cWe\u2019re all cops,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re all police officers.\u201dBut officers coming to terms with their gender identity said they faced a dilemma. Those who delay making the transition while on the force face the corrosive toll of living what feels like a fraudulent life; those who do make it risk being rejected from the tight-knit fellowship of law enforcement that was also central to their identity.Denise Dragos, who had been a detective in the Police Department investigating computer crimes, put off transitioning to female from male until after she retired two years ago. She worried how colleagues would react. \u201cIt was going to be difficult,\u201d Ms. Dragos, 43, said. \u201cThings are changing in leaps and bounds over the last several years, but even four or five years ago, it didn\u2019t seem in the scope of possibility.\u201dNow, after she wore a No. 2 buzz cut for two decades, her hair reaches to her shoulders. A judge signed off on her name change in June. And she came out last year to a group of her former colleagues, though not in a way she had anticipated.Ms. Dragos had maintained dual lives on social media. On Facebook, she kept her old \u201cboy\u201d page, as she called it, and one for her new life as a woman. Then, she said, her \u201cgirl\u201d page showed up on the list of suggested friends of a police colleague, who took a screen shot and posted it in a group message, noting a resemblance.Some thought it was a joke.Ms. Dragos was traveling and received a text message from someone in the thread, asking if she had seen it. She recalled feeling a range of emotions: anger, fear, nervousness. But also relief.She decided she had to tell them.\u201cSo \u2026 Yes, that\u2019s me,\u201d she wrote in a group message. \u201cI have known this about myself for many years now, and kept it hidden deep down inside. I am now at a point in my life where I have thought about all of my options. I\u2019m going forward and have decided to take the step so you know this isn\u2019t a decision that was made overnight.\u201cI\u2019m happy, and that\u2019s what it is.\u201dThe initial surprise and confusion gave way to support. People who had made the earlier remarks apologized. Others encouraged her. And then, the conversation in the thread turned to baseball. She came out to other friends and acquaintances this summer, changing her name on social media to Denise and posting a picture of herself from a pride event.\u201cThat was a very stressful experience, coming out that way,\u201d Ms. Dragos said. \u201cBut it turned around and was one of the best things that happened for me.\u201dTcops International, or the Transgender Community of Police and Sheriffs, started in the late 1990s as a support group for a small network of officers to share their experiences online. For many of them, fears about coming out or transitioning were rooted in a harsh reality.But some have expressed optimism, believing that a broader cultural shift in the acceptance of transgender people was finding its way into policing. \u201cOfficers hired in the past five to 10 years have a better understanding of who we are,\u201d said Julie Callahan, a founder of Tcops International, who retired after 30 years as a police officer in San Jose, Calif.\u201cMore and more people will understand that we\u2019re not villains,\u201d she said, noting that the exposure many veteran officers had to transgender people was limited to interactions on the job, negatively shading their impressions. \u201cThey see sex workers, they see drug abusers, they see people stealing to support their habit or to survive,\u201d she added. \u201cThey translate their experiences with those people to all transgender people.\u201dOfficer Brooke Bukowski of the New York Police Department got her start in what police officers call an \u201cA-House,\u201d one of the precincts in New York where crime and violence persists, the kind of place where young officers can earn their stripes. After the academy, she was assigned to the 75th Precinct, which covers the East New York section of Brooklyn and has consistently had one of the highest murder rates in the city.Officer Bukowski, a United States Coast Guard veteran who was raised in rural Illinois, had started taking a low dose of hormones to transition before she joined the Police Department five years ago. She stopped when she entered the academy.But once she graduated, she resumed taking the hormones. When she moved to the 70th Precinct, in Flatbush, her transition became more apparent. Her hair grew longer, and her body changed. While she was on patrol, people on the street would refer to her as Miss, and she remembered overhearing two men in custody discussing her. \u201cThey literally start arguing over what gender I am,\u201d she said.She reached a point where she was \u201cmale failing,\u201d as she put it, a term in the transgender community meaning one could no longer pass as male. And after speaking with her superiors, she addressed roll call, explaining her transition.\u201cListen guys, I still have the same work ethic,\u201d Officer Bukowski, 33, recalled telling them. \u201cI\u2019m still going to back you up. It\u2019s just a few physical changes here and there.\u201dHer colleagues have mostly been supportive and encouraging. But there have been obstacles, mostly bureaucratic encounters within the department. For instance, she had a hard time getting a new identification card. She was told she was not due for one yet, though her appearance had drastically changed. (She eventually got a new card.) And around the time that Ms. Jenner appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair, Officer Bukowski was working on a detail with an older officer who made disparaging remarks about transgender people, unaware that Officer Bukowski was herself transgender. She opted to quietly finish the shift without saying anything. \u201cI had an hour left with the guy,\u201d she said.Because of her experiences, Officer Bukowski felt a pull to be open in the department and to help train other officers, even if it went against a competing urge to keep quiet, working as a woman and going home to her boyfriend. \u201cYou go through a lot all your life, so when you finally get there and you\u2019re lucky enough to pass,\u201d she said, a large part of her wanted just to embrace it.\u201cThey just see me as any other female,\u201d she said.For most of the past three years, Officer Bukowski has helped to train recruits at the Police Academy on transgender issues, replacing the video that had been shown when she was there.She is now assigned to the Sixth Precinct, and Inspector Simonetti praised the energy she has brought to her work, and her instincts as an officer. He added that the department also benefited by having officers with life experiences like hers, who can establish a dialogue with a group of New Yorkers who have viewed the police with suspicion. \u201cIt opens up avenues or lines of communication that in years past may not have been there,\u201d he said.Still, in a department with 36,000 uniformed police officers, Officer Bukowski is part of subset that is virtually microscopic. She said she had met a few other transgender officers; only one of them is out. \u201cAs far as the open community,\u201d Officer Bukowski said, \u201cit\u2019s Aiden and I, as far as we know.\u201dAiden chose his name because it did not strike him as overly masculine. He figured it would help soften the impact for his family.As the academy approached, Officer Budd said he was in a mad dash \u2014 changing his name and gender on official records and almost everywhere else that had his former identity on file.He pulled it off: On July 7, he was Aiden Budd, male recruit. He fit in well and became the company sergeant, a position of leadership among fellow recruits. \u201cThey took to him pretty quick,\u201d said Officer Ayesha Marty, an instructor in the academy. \u201cThey respected him.\u201dBut in his push to transition, he made an ambitious move: Two weeks in, he scheduled his \u201ctop surgery,\u201d a procedure in which breasts are removed and the chest is recontoured. He told fellow recruits he needed to have a growth removed.After he returned, he pulled his company aside and told them he was transgender. \u201cI thought it was important for them to know that part of myself,\u201d he said. They responded positively and without much of a fuss, he said.Officer Budd has an easygoing manner with a broad smile. He looks young for 33, so much so that fellow officers have given him the nickname \u201cBenjamin Button,\u201d after the character who ages in reverse. His fianc\u00e9e, Idalia Sumpter, said he was genuine and had a self-assurance that made people feel comfortable around him. But Officer Budd\u2019s transition has been transformative in more ways than physical, Ms. Sumpter said. He wasn\u2019t always so confident. \u201cHe has come a long, long way,\u201d she said, laughing.His struggles with identity had been a source of pain and confusion. As a teenager, he was outed as a lesbian when his mother found notes from a high school crush. After high school, he enlisted in the Army as a woman, but that was in the era of \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell,\u201d a policy that allowed gay and lesbian soldiers to serve, but not openly, and he said he was discharged after almost a year because of his sexual orientation. (After the policy was rescinded, he re-enlisted as a reservist, still as a woman.)\u201cI remember asking God a couple of times as a child why I wasn\u2019t born a boy,\u201d Officer Budd said. \u201cIf he knew how I felt, why didn\u2019t he just make it happen that way, to avoid all these issues with me liking women and me wanting to be in men\u2019s apparel and doing boy things?\u201d\u201cI never really got that answer as a kid,\u201d he continued. \u201cI kept those feelings to myself.\u201dHis transition has not been without hurdles. Some family members had a hard time. His sister, with whom he is very close, looked at it at first as if she were losing a sister. His uncle, whom Officer Budd considers his role model, did not attend his graduation.But that unsettled feeling that had rankled for most of his life has faded. He has been surprised by the people who stuck by him, including his great-grandmother. He and Ms. Sumpter, who met while working as school safety agents, plan to marry next year. On Dec. 29, 2015, he graduated from the academy, accomplishing that lifelong goal. He aspires to someday make detective.And in July, he said, he went on his first training exercise as an Army reservist since his transition, staying in the male barracks without issue.Even as more women have joined the police force, many officers still talk of their profession as a brotherhood, and it is one that Officer Budd wants to be part of. Anxieties over acceptance still linger as more of his colleagues learn of his background. \u201cI think I\u2019m only worried about not being man enough,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce somebody finds out the truth, they may think, like, \u2018Oh, this guy\u2019s not really man enough \u2014 what does he know about being a man?\u2019\u201dHe added that he was learning that \u201ca lot of it is my own fear.\u201dSince his graduation from the academy, Officer Budd has been assigned to the 20th Precinct in Manhattan, spending most of his time on the streets of the Upper West Side. One officer heard a rumor that he was transgender and gently asked about it. Officer Budd was certain others knew as well. But as he starts his career, his focus has been on building a good reputation, earning the trust of other officers. \u201cLike any other rookie, you want the guys to know you as a good cop,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing else.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook Live: Too Much, Too Soon", "Date": "2016-08-20", "News": "Supported byThe Public EditorIT\u2019S been just over four months since The New York Times started producing live video for Facebook, but already the scoreboard is flashing. A few earned gold medals. Several others finished strong. And a lot should never have made the team.Like Helen Mirren with an iPhone, Acosta tracked down leads, chased dead ends and live-streamed a suspenseful tale that ranks among The Times\u2019s more successful videos in the emerging genre of \u201cLive.\u201d Reporters are always solving mysteries, but what made this unique is that Acosta did so both with her audience watching and with some offering up real-time clues.These videos represent a potentially transformational form of journalism because they let stories unfold organically, live, and with the audience able to change the experience. What is also new is that this experiment is the first where The Times is producing exclusive work for someone else\u2019s platform, in this case Facebook\u2019s. Which means that virtually none of the hundreds of videos that The Times has produced can be found on its own website.Why would the editors make such a deal? For the same reason other media companies have. Not because they revere Facebook, but because they yearn to reach its 1.7 billion users. Think of it like the annoying kid in high school who somehow gets invited to all the good parties; you hang out with him because he opens doors, not because he\u2019s your best friend. This is the same, only with higher stakes.For The Times the goal is twofold, says Louise Story, an investigative reporter who oversees the Live team. \u201cOne is to develop video that appeals to a Facebook audience, about two-thirds of which is under 34,\u201d she says. \u201cSecond is to help people around the newsroom think more about audience.\u201dUltimately, there is surely a hope that this could turn the valve on a new advertising stream.That all sounds good. But here\u2019s the problem. After watching countless hours of live video in the past few weeks, I have hit upon many that are either plagued by technical malfunctions, feel contrived, drone on too long, ignore audience questions or are simply boring, by I imagine most anyone\u2019s standards.When Times live videos are good \u2014 and many are \u2014 they capture an immediate experience, feel spontaneous and put the viewer in a front-row seat with a hand on the controls.This is a puzzling predicament for The Times. On the one hand, it has before it a compelling new form of journalism, a young and eager audience, and the crown prince of social media opening up its checkbook. On the other hand, if you\u2019re producing about 120 videos a month, implementing good quality control can take a back seat. Changing that might mean instituting clear rules of the road, like: no tedious interviews between two talking heads; no greenlighting weak ideas; and absolutely no videos that essentially fabricate scenes for the camera.The Times\u2019s top editor, Dean Baquet, believes mistakes are the price of innovation. \u201cHave we done some stuff that\u2019s not so pretty? Yes,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the newsroom needs to get comfortable using their imaginative brains to tell stories in different ways.\u201dI need no convincing that live, interactive video is a medium worth embracing. If you\u2019re not experimenting in the digital age, you won\u2019t survive. But this particular experiment veers significantly from The Times\u2019s past approach to new journalism forms. The newsroom has shown that innovation doesn\u2019t have to equate with poor quality. Whether it was with interactive graphics, virtual reality or podcasts, The Times is a model for innovating at a thoughtful, measured pace, but with quality worthy of its name.This time, that\u2019s not the case. It\u2019s as if we passed over beta and went straight to bulk. What I hope is that The Times pauses to regroup, returning with a rigor that more sharply defines the exceptional and rejects the second-rate. After all, the world has a glut of bad video and not enough of the kind The Times is capable of producing.Evan Gershkovich contributed research for this column.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "From Humans of New York to Obama\u2019s Office: How a Principal Built a School", "Date": "2016-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionNadia Lopez is an unlikely star of the internet age \u2014 an urban-middle-school principal whose story went viral. It all began in January 2015 when the blog Humans of New York featured an eighth grader at her school named Vidal. \u201cWho\u2019s influenced you the most in your life?\u201d the young boy bundled in a hoodie and a black jacket was asked. \u201cMy principal,\u201d he answered. A few days later, Brandon Stanton, the photographer responsible for the blog, visited Lopez and her school, Mott Hall Bridges Academy, in the Brownsville neighborhood of Brooklyn. There he found a young principal striving to turn a public school into a bulwark against the forces of urban distress. She became an overnight sensation.Lopez and Vidal were guests on Ellen DeGeneres\u2019s television show and \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d and President Obama met with them in the Oval Office. Target donated $100,000 worth of iPads and other electronics to Mott Hall Bridges and other schools in Brownsville. A crowdfunding campaign started by Stanton raised more than $1.4 million for Lopez\u2019s school of roughly 200 sixth-through-eighth graders, and Stanton\u2019s post about Vidal garnered more than a million \u201clikes\u201d on Facebook. Lopez used some of the money to take her students on a tour of Harvard University in hopes of inspiring them to reach far beyond Brooklyn. Harvard\u2019s president, Drew Gilpin Faust, personally addressed them, as did four undergraduates from poor communities and \u00adsingle-parent homes, and several professors delivered middle-school versions of their regular lectures.And then the spotlight moved elsewhere, leaving Lopez, her teachers and her students to soldier on without the nation\u2019s beneficence and attention. That day-in, day-out struggle is the subject of \u201cThe Bridge to Brilliance: How One Principal in a Tough Community Is Inspiring the World.\u201dWhile the book, which Lopez wrote with Rebecca Paley, reads at times as if it had been rushed into print to capitalize on the social media buzz, it offers a valuable depiction of what it takes for principals and teachers to reach children in the most troubled communities. The students of Mott Hall Bridges are almost all Latino or African-American; they are growing up in deep poverty amid traumatizing violence. Thirty percent have learning disabilities, more than twice the national average. Lopez\u2019s mission, as she sees it, is \u201csimply to take care of kids everyone else seemed to want to forget.\u201dShe recounts working late nights, weekends and holidays, tutoring and counseling struggling students. She takes a boy who had never been to a bookstore to the flagship Barnes & Noble in Manhattan. She spends every day of her spring break tutoring a student who was failing both reading and math. She sets up social clubs for boys (I Matter) and girls (She Is Me). She helps a boy whose mother has died start a support group for children who have lost a parent.Mott Hall Bridges is a district school, not a charter school, but Lopez steers clear of the polarizing debate between advocates of those two formats. Still, she makes clear her disapproval of so-called no-excuses charter schools, citing one with high test scores in Brooklyn so punitive that in her view some students \u201ccould easily wind up incarcerated in part from constantly being reminded that they are not good enough.\u201d She also strongly objects to the nationwide practice of rating teachers and schools based on student test scores. Many of her own students scored \u201cbelow proficient\u201d or \u201cwell below proficient\u201d on state exams.\u201cWhat began to weigh heavy on me,\u201d Lopez writes, \u201cwas that at the same time I was struggling to get my scholars and their families to believe in themselves, I was part of an educational system that, despite its best intentions, only reinforced their failures.\u201d In late 2014, she fell prey to insomnia and developed a debilitating chronic immune disease. Sometimes, alone in her office, she found herself in tears. \u201cI was broken,\u201d she confesses. Then Brandon Stanton showed up with his camera and gave her a second wind.It\u2019s telling that social media rather than our system of public education helped Lopez find the strength to go on. Her book will give readers even more reasons to ask what we as a society are doing to support the thousands of educators who labor in obscurity, trying to help the nation\u2019s most vulnerable children.Dale Russakoff is the author of \u201cThe Prize: Who\u2019s in Charge of America\u2019s Schools?,\u201d which has just been released in paperback.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Paul Massey, Real Estate Executive, to Run for Mayor of New York City", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPaul J. Massey Jr., a millionaire real estate executive, took steps on Thursday toward running for mayor of New York City \u2014 styling himself in the mold of former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, as a wealthy businessman and an outsider to politics with the management chops needed to run the nation\u2019s biggest city.But if Mr. Massey, a Republican, wanted to project the image of a capable manager, his first act as a declared candidate did little to help that cause.Although a news release announced that Mr. Massey had filed papers to begin his run for mayor with the city\u2019s Campaign Finance Board, a spokesman for the board, Matthew Sollars, said that officials there were not aware of having received any such filing.At the same time, John Conklin, a spokesman for the State Board of Elections, said that papers were filed on Thursday to form a political committee called Massey for Mayor 2017 \u2014 but that the filing was missing a required document and the papers were returned.Although Mr. Massey is little known outside the real estate world, and will have to work mightily to achieve the name recognition needed to make a successful run for mayor, he turned down a request for an interview.\u201cHe\u2019s not doing any interviews right now,\u201d a spokeswoman, Jessica Proud, said. \u201cIt\u2019s a soft launch.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Massey, William F.

In the months ahead, we will be sharing our strategic vision for the city.\u201dThe statement from his campaign said that he would not take part in the city\u2019s matching funds program, which caps candidate spending, and that he would finance his campaign himself and with donations from others.Dan Levitan, a spokesman for Mr. de Blasio\u2019s re-election campaign, said the mayor would gladly stack his record against any challenger and took a jab at Mr. Massey for being a longtime resident of Larchmont, in Westchester County, and only recently taking an apartment in Manhattan.\u201cUnder Mayor de Blasio, crime just hit another all-time low, jobs are at record highs, the city is building and preserving affordable housing at a record pace, while graduation rates and test scores continue to improve,\u201d Mr. Levitan said. \u201cWe are happy to match that record against any resident of New York City or Larchmont.\u201dBradley Tusk, a political consultant who has formed a \u201csuper PAC\u201d to seek to defeat Mr. de Blasio in next year\u2019s election, said in a statement: \u201cWhenever there is a talented, hardworking person who wants to be mayor, we are interested in hearing from them, but we continue to feel that the next mayor will come from winning the Democratic primary, and that\u2019s what we are working towards.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When the Pilot Is a Mom: Accommodating New Motherhood at 30,000 Feet", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBoarding a flight can feel like stepping into a time capsule \u2014 men typically fly the plane, while most flight attendants are still women. Which is why a female pilot from Delta Air Lines did something dramatic at a union meeting recently.Standing before her male colleagues, the captain unbuttoned her uniform, strapped a breast pump over the white undershirt she wore underneath, and began to demonstrate the apparatus. As the machine made its typical \u201cchug, chug, chug\u201d noise, attendees squirmed in their seats, looked at their feet and shuffled papers.It was the latest episode in what has proved to be a difficult workplace issue to solve: how to accommodate commercial airline pilots who are balancing new motherhood.While their proposals differ, all say they aim for one thing: to avoid situations in which pilots have been leaving the cockpit in midflight for as long as 20 minutes, the amount of time often required to pump breast milk.\u201cThe airlines have maternity policies that are archaic,\u201d said Kathy McCullough, 61, a retired captain for Northwest Airlines, which merged with Delta in 2008, who has advocated on behalf of the pilots to Delta management. \u201cI am so glad that they\u2019re stepping forward and taking a stand.\u201dMore than 40 years later, the major carriers still haven\u2019t resolved this issue. They set their policies for pilots based on the collective bargaining agreements negotiated by the unions. But women of childbearing age account for just a sliver of union membership, so maternity leave and breast-feeding policies have not been at the top of union agendas.Plus, some members oppose the proposals, citing the costs. One local union leader told several women in an email: \u201cHaving a child is a personal choice and asking the rest of us to fund your choice will be a difficult sell to the pilot group.\u201d The leader declined to be interviewed for this article; the union said he was not an authorized spokesman.Delta\u2019s female pilots still hope to win over a majority of their colleagues. They argue that without paid leave, they\u2019re faced with a choice to either stay home to breast-feed their babies or earn income for their families.Female pilots can begin to lose wages months before a baby is born. Most contracts at major airlines force pregnant pilots to stop flying eight to 14 weeks before a baby\u2019s due date.After the push by Delta\u2019s pilots this summer, the airline changed its policy this month. Delta now allows them to fly, with their doctor\u2019s approval, until the end of pregnancy if they so choose.Morgan Durrant, a spokesman for Delta, pointed out that once they stop flying, women can use accrued sick days or apply for disability benefits to partially cover their lost wages. Otherwise, the leave is unpaid.Once a baby is born, the major airlines typically don\u2019t offer paid maternity leave or alternative ground assignments for breast-feeding mothers. Some carriers, including United Airlines and Alaska Airlines, do offer female pilots up to one year of unpaid leave. Until recently, Delta did not offer such a policy, but the airline has added one year of unpaid leave to the pilot contract.Next a flight attendant \u2014 to prevent passengers from approaching the lavatory \u2014 would barricade the aisle with a beverage cart. Then the attendant would join the captain in the cockpit, in keeping with rules that require at least two people in an airline cockpit at all times.Only then could Ms. Beck slip into the lavatory for a 20-minute pumping session.\u201cIt\u2019s by far not my favorite place to make my child\u2019s next meal,\u201d Ms. Beck said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a sacrifice I knew I would have to accept because I came back to work.\u201dMs. Beck said that after nearly 20 years in the aviation industry, she assumed she could keep her job and nurse her baby. \u201cI guess it never came to light in my mind that I couldn\u2019t do both,\u201d she said.Frontier\u2019s management has argued that extended breaks from the cockpit raise safety issues. The company has not offered an in-flight alternative for breast pumping, however, or made available temporary jobs on the ground.\u201cWhile there are many workplaces that might allow for nursing mothers to express breast milk during a break from work activities, the duties of a commercial airline pilot present unique circumstances,\u201d a Frontier spokesman, Jim Faulkner, said in a statement.The Federal Aviation Administration has issued no official rules for pilots who pump in-flight. But Alison Duquette, a spokeswoman for the agency, said that \u201cleaving the flight deck for 20 minutes would not be acceptable\u201d under most circumstances.A lactating mother often needs to pump breast milk every three to four hours. When she cannot do so, painful pressure can build up in her chest, accompanied by a risk of infection.\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly distracting and painful,\u201d said Ms. Beck, \u201clike when you need to go to the bathroom and can\u2019t.\u201dIn a few instances at Delta, according to several of the airline\u2019s women pilots, their colleagues had to pump breast milk in the cockpit. The pumps need electricity, and in some older planes, the only plugs available are on the flight deck.The Delta female pilots are seeking a leave policy that would let mothers stay home for six months with pay to breast-feed newborns, and up to two years of unpaid leave.Pilots can earn a base salary of $200,000 and more in later years. But young pilots often start at low wages as flight instructors, crop dusters, or flying charter or tourism flights, and don\u2019t reach the major carriers until their early 30s, a time when they may be planning families. As a result, one Delta pilot said, it is not uncommon for several women in a class of new pilots to be pregnant after a standard yearlong period of probation flying.Ten female Delta pilots agreed to speak to The New York Times on the condition of anonymity, for fear of alienating their employer or the male union members they hope will take up their cause.The union, through a spokeswoman, Kelly Regus, declined to comment on \u201cthe substance of internal union discussions.\u201d Mr. Durrant, the Delta spokesman, noted that the airline had updated some of its policies, and he said it would continue to examine its maternity and paternity leave programs.\u201cBalancing the demands of a career and raising a family present challenges for all working parents, but we recognize there are unique challenges presented for our female pilots as their children are born,\u201d Mr. Durrant said in an emailed statement.It has been difficult for the women to compare notes about workplace issues. There are so few of them, they rarely see or fly with one another. That changed with a private Facebook group known as FAST \u2014 Female Aviators Sticking Together \u2014 that has grown quickly over the past year. It now has nearly 6,000 members.There are also spinoffs like DAMP, or Delta Air Lines Mommy Pilots. The woman who delivered the breast pump demonstration in June did so on behalf of about 100 pilots in that Facebook group.And the Delta and Frontier pilots know they are pressing an issue that still plagues a group long dominated by women: flight attendants.This year, a flight attendant for Endeavor Air, a regional airline owned by Delta, filed a discrimination complaint with the New York City Commission on Human Rights, claiming the airline failed to provide reasonable breaks or private places to pump breast milk in her workplace. The commission is investigating.Mr. Durrant, the Delta spokesman, said Endeavor had worked to accommodate the employee and \u201chas gone to great lengths to provide reasonable accommodations for breast-feeding employees.\u201dJoanna L. Grossman, an expert on labor law and gender issues, said the pilots are fighting a complex battle.\u201cThis is part of breaking down the cockpit door \u2014 that\u2019s the glass ceiling here,\u201d said Ms. Grossman, a professor at the Dedman School of Law at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. \u201cHow do you make a job work when it was designed without you in mind?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fractured Lands: How the Arab World Came Apart", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "TKThis is a story unlike any we have previously published. It is much longer than the typical New York Times Magazine feature story; in print, it occupies an entire issue. The product of some 18 months of reporting, it tells the story of the catastrophe that has fractured the Arab world since the invasion of Iraq 13 years ago, leading to the rise of ISIS and the global refugee crisis. The geography of this catastrophe is broad and its causes are many, but its consequences \u2014 war and uncertainty throughout the world \u2014 are familiar to us all. Scott Anderson\u2019s story gives the reader a visceral sense of how it all unfolded, through the eyes of six characters in Egypt, Libya, Syria, Iraq and Iraqi Kurdistan. Accompanying Anderson\u2019s text are 10 portfolios by the photographer Paolo Pellegrin, drawn from his extensive travels across the region over the last 14 years, as well as a landmark virtual-reality experience that embeds the viewer with the Iraqi fighting forces during the battle to retake Falluja.It is unprecedented for us to focus so much energy and attention on a single story, and to ask our readers to do the same. We would not do so were we not convinced that what follows is one of the most clear-eyed, powerful and human explanations of what has gone wrong in this region that you will ever read.\u2013 JAKE SILVERSTEIN, EDITOR IN CHIEFWe\u2019re saving your reading progress so you can pick up where you left off later.Our destination that day in May 2015 was the place of Azar\u2019s greatest sorrow, one that haunted him still. The previous year, ISIS gunmen had cut a murderous swath through northern Iraq, brushing away an Iraqi Army vastly greater in size, and then turning their attention to the Kurds. Azar had divined precisely where the ISIS killers were about to strike, knew that tens of thousands of civilians stood helpless in their path, but had been unable to get anyone to heed his warnings. In desperation, he had loaded up his car with guns and raced to the scene, only to come to a spot in the road where he saw he was just hours too late. \u201cIt was obvious,\u201d Azar said, \u201cso obvious. But no one wanted to listen.\u201d On that day, we were returning to the place where the fabled Kurdish warriors of northern Iraq had been outmaneuvered and put to flight, where Dr. Azar Mirkhan had failed to avert a colossal tragedy \u2014 and where, for many more months to come, he would continue to battle ISIS.Azar is a practicing urologist, but even without the firepower and warrior get-up, the 41-year-old would exude the aura of a hunter. He walks with a curious loping gait that produces little sound, and in conversation has a tendency to tuck his chin and stare from beneath heavy-lidded eyes, rather as if he were sighting down a gun. With his prominent nose and jet black pompadour, he bears a passing resemblance to a young Johnny Cash.The weaponry also complemented the doctor\u2019s personal philosophy, as expressed in a scene from one of his favorite movies, \u201cThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly,\u201d when a bathing Eli Wallach is caught off guard by a man seeking to kill him. Rather than immediately shoot Wallach, the would-be assassin goes into a triumphant soliloquy, allowing Wallach to kill him first.\u201cWhen you have to shoot, shoot; don\u2019t talk,\u201d Azar quoted from the movie. \u201cThat is us Kurds now. This is not the time to talk, but to shoot.\u201dFor each of these six people, the upheavals were crystallized by a specific, singular event. For Azar Mirkhan, it came on the road to Sinjar, when he saw that his worst fears had come true. For Laila Soueif in Egypt, it came when a young man separated from a sprinting mass of protesters to embrace her, and she thought she knew the revolution would succeed. For Majdi el-Mangoush in Libya, it came as he walked across a deadly no-man\u2019s-land and, overwhelmed by a sudden euphoria, felt free for the first time in his life. For Khulood al-Zaidi in Iraq, it came when, with just a few menacing words from a former friend, she finally understood that everything she had worked for was gone. For Majd Ibrahim in Syria, it came when, watching an interrogator search his cellphone for the identity of his \u201ccontroller,\u201d he knew his own execution was drawing nearer by the moment. For Wakaz Hassan in Iraq, a young man with no apparent interest in politics or religion, it came on the day ISIS gunmen showed up in his village and offered him a choice.As disparate as those moments were, for each of these six people they represented a crossing over, passage to a place from which there will never be a return. Such changes, of course \u2014 multiplied by millions of lives \u2014 are also transforming their homelands, the greater Middle East and, by inevitable extension, the entire world.As a writer with long experience in the Middle East, I initially welcomed the convulsions of the Arab Spring \u2014 indeed, I believed they were long overdue. In the early 1970s, I traveled through the region as a young boy with my father, a journey that sparked both my fascination with Islam and my love of the desert. The Middle East was also the site of my first foray into journalism when, in the summer of 1983, I hopped on a plane to the embattled city Beirut in hopes of finding work as a stringer. Over the subsequent years, I embedded with a platoon of Israeli commandos conducting raids in the West Bank; dined with Janjaweed raiders in Darfur; interviewed the families of suicide bombers. Ultimately, I took a five-year hiatus from magazine journalism to write a book on the historical origins of the modern Middle East.Experience firsthand the battles Iraqi forces endured to retake the city of Falluja from ISIS.Text yourself a link to get the NYT VR app.Please enter a 10-digit US mobile number.For iOS and Android.

While Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya set a record for longevity in the Middle East with his 42-year dictatorship, it was not that different elsewhere; by 2011, any Egyptian younger than 41 \u2014 and that was roughly 75 percent of the population \u2014 had only ever known two heads of state, while a Syrian of the same age had lived his or her entire life under the control of the father-and-son Assad dynasty. Along with political stasis, in many Arab nations most levers of economic power lay in the hands of small oligarchies or aristocratic families; for everyone else, about the only path to financial security was to wrangle a job within fantastically bloated public-sector bureaucracies, government agencies that were often themselves monuments to nepotism and corruption. While the sheer amount of money pouring into oil-rich, sparsely populated nations like Libya or Kuwait might allow for a degree of economic trickle-down prosperity, this was not the case in more populous but resource-poor nations like Egypt or Syria, where poverty and underemployment were severe and \u2014 given the ongoing regional population explosion \u2014 ever-worsening problems.I was heartened, in the Arab Spring\u2019s early days, by the focus of the people\u2019s wrath. One of the Arab world\u2019s most prominent and debilitating features, I had long felt, was a culture of grievance that was defined less by what people aspired to than by what they opposed. They were anti-Zionist, anti-West, anti-imperialist. For generations, the region\u2019s dictators had been adroit at channeling public frustration toward these external \u201cenemies\u201d and away from their own misrule. But with the Arab Spring, that old playbook suddenly didn\u2019t work anymore. Instead, and for the first time on such a mass scale, the people of the Middle East were directing their rage squarely at the regimes themselves.Then it all went horribly wrong. By the summer of 2012, two of the \u201cfreed\u201d nations \u2014 Libya and Yemen \u2014 were sliding into anarchy and factionalism, while the struggle against the Bashar al-Assad government in Syria had descended into vicious civil war. In Egypt the following summer, the nation\u2019s first democratically elected government was overthrown by the military, a coup cheered on by many of the same young activists who took to the streets to demand democracy two years earlier. The only truly bright spot among the Arab Spring nations was the place where it started, Tunisia, but even there, terrorist attacks and feuding politicians were a constant threat to a fragile government. Amid the chaos, the remnants of Osama bin Laden\u2019s old outfit, Al Qaeda, gained a new lease on life, resurrected the war in Iraq and then spawned an even more severe and murderous offshoot: the Islamic State, or ISIS.The scattershot nature of the Arab Spring makes it hard to provide a single answer. Some nations were radically transformed, even as others right next door were barely touched. Some of the nations in crisis were relatively wealthy (Libya), others crushingly poor (Yemen). Some countries with comparatively benign dictatorships (Tunisia) blew up along with some of the region\u2019s most brutal (Syria). The same range of political and economic disparity is seen in the nations that remained stable.Yet one pattern does emerge, and it is striking. While most of the 22 nations that make up the Arab world have been buffeted to some degree by the Arab Spring, the six most profoundly affected \u2014 Egypt, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen \u2014 are all republics, rather than monarchies. And of these six, the three that have disintegrated so completely as to raise doubt that they will ever again exist as functioning states \u2014 Iraq, Syria and Libya \u2014 are all members of that small list of Arab countries created by Western imperial powers in the early 20th century. In each, little thought was given to national coherence, and even less to tribal or sectarian divisions. Certainly, these same internal divisions exist in many of the region\u2019s other republics, as well as in its monarchies, but it would seem undeniable that those two factors operating in concert \u2014 the lack of an intrinsic sense of national identity joined to a form of government that supplanted the traditional organizing principle of society \u2014 left Iraq, Syria and Libya especially vulnerable when the storms of change descended.In fact, all but one of the six people profiled ahead are from these \u201cartificial states,\u201d and their individual stories are rooted in the larger story of how those nations came to be. The process began at the end of World War I, when two of the victorious allies, Britain and France, carved up the lands of the defeated Ottoman Empire between themselves as spoils of war. In Mesopotamia, the British joined together three largely autonomous Ottoman provinces and named it Iraq. The southernmost of these provinces was dominated by Shiite Arabs, the central by Sunni Arabs and the northernmost by non-Arab Kurds. To the west of Iraq, the European powers took the opposite approach, carving the vast lands of \u201cgreater Syria\u201d into smaller, more manageable parcels. Falling under French rule was the smaller rump state of Syria \u2014 essentially the nation that exists today \u2014 and the coastal enclave of Lebanon, while the British took Palestine and Transjordan, a swath of southern Syria that would eventually become Israel and Jordan. Coming a bit later to the game, in 1934, Italy joined the three ancient North African regions that it had wrested from the Ottomans in 1912 to form the colony of Libya.To maintain dominion over these fractious territories, the European powers adopted the same divide-and-conquer approach that served them so well in the colonization of sub-Saharan Africa. This consisted of empowering a local ethnic or religious minority to serve as their local administrators, confident that this minority would never rebel against their foreign overseers lest they be engulfed by the disenfranchised majority.This was only the most overt level of the Europeans\u2019 divide-and-conquer strategy, however, for just beneath the sectarian and regional divisions in these \u201cnations\u201d there lay extraordinarily complex tapestries of tribes and subtribes and clans, ancient social orders that remained the populations\u2019 principal source of identification and allegiance. Much as the United States Army and white settlers did with Indian tribes in the conquest of the American West, so the British and French and Italians proved adept at pitting these groups against one another, bestowing favors \u2014 weapons or food or sinecures \u2014 to one faction in return for fighting another. The great difference, of course, is that in the American West, the settlers stayed and the tribal system was essentially destroyed. In the Arab world, the Europeans eventually left, but the sectarian and tribal schisms they fueled remained.While today that image is remembered in the Arab world with resentment \u2014 the symbolism of this latest Western intervention in their region was quite inescapable \u2014 at the time it spurred something far more nuanced. For the first time in their lives, what Syrians and Libyans and other Arabs just as much as Iraqis saw was that a figure as seemingly immovable as Saddam Hussein could be cast aside, that the political and social paralysis that had so long held their collective lands might actually be broken. Not nearly so apparent was that these strongmen had actually exerted considerable energy to bind up their nations, and in their absence the ancient forces of tribalism and sectarianism would begin to exert their own centrifugal pull. Even less apparent was how these forces would both attract and repel the United States, damaging its power and prestige in the region to an extent from which it might never recover.At least one man saw this quite clearly. For much of 2002, the Bush administration had laid the groundwork for the Iraq invasion by accusing Saddam Hussein of pursuing a weapons-of-mass-destruction program and obliquely linking him to the Sept. 11 attacks. In October 2002, six months before Firdos Square, I had a long interview with Muammar el-Qaddafi, and I asked him who would benefit if the Iraq invasion actually occurred. The Libyan dictator had a habit of theatrically pondering before answering my questions, but his reply to that one was instantaneous. \u201cBin Laden,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no doubt about that. And Iraq could end up becoming the staging ground for Al Qaeda, because if the Saddam government collapses, it will be anarchy in Iraq. If that happens, actions against Americans will be considered jihad.\u201dBeginning in April 2015, the photographer Paolo Pellegrin and I embarked on a series of extended trips to the Middle East. Separately and as a writer-photographer team, we had covered an array of conflicts in the region over the previous 20 years, and our hope on this new set of journeys was to gain a greater understanding of the so-called Arab Spring and its generally grim aftermath. As the situation continued to deteriorate through 2015 and 2016, our travels expanded: to those islands in Greece bearing the brunt of the migrant exodus from Iraq and Syria; to the front lines in northern Iraq where the battle against ISIS was being most vigorously waged.We have presented the results of this 16-month project in the form of six individual narratives, which, woven within the larger strands of history, aim to provide a tapestry of an Arab World in revolt.The account is divided into five parts, which proceed chronologically as they alternate between our principal characters. Along with introducing several of these individuals, Part 1 focuses on three historical factors that are crucial to understanding the current crisis: the inherent instability of the Middle East\u2019s artificial states; the precarious position in which U.S.-allied Arab governments have found themselves when compelled to pursue policies bitterly opposed by their own people; and American involvement in the de facto partitioning of Iraq 25 years ago, an event little remarked upon at the time \u2014 and barely more so since \u2014 that helped call into question the very legitimacy of the modern Arab nation-state. Part 2 is primarily devoted to the American invasion of Iraq, and to how it laid the groundwork for the Arab Spring revolts. In Part 3, the narrative quickens, as we follow the explosive outcome of those revolts as they occurred in Egypt, Libya and Syria. By Part 4, which chronicles the rise of ISIS, and Part 5, which tracks the resulting exodus from the region, we are squarely in the present, at the heart of the world\u2019s gravest concern.I have tried to tell a human story, one that has its share of heroes, even some glimmers of hope. But what follows, ultimately, is a dark warning. Today the tragedy and violence of the Middle East have spilled from its banks, with nearly a million Syrians and Iraqis flooding into Europe to escape the wars in their homelands, and terrorist attacks in Dhaka, Paris and beyond. With the ISIS cause being invoked by mass murderers in San Bernardino and Orlando, the issues of immigration and terrorism have now become conjoined in many Americans\u2019 minds, forming a key political flash point in the coming presidential election. In some sense, it is fitting that the crisis of the Arab world has its roots in the First World War, for like that war, it is a regional crisis that has come quickly and widely \u2014 with little seeming reason or logic \u2014 to influence events at every corner of the globe.Laila Soueif at home in Cairo, June 2016.Wakaz Hassan outside Kirkuk, Iraq, December 2015.Azar Mirkhan in the Sinjar region, Iraq, November 2015.Majd Ibrahim in Dresden, Germany, November 2015.\u00a0Khulood al-Zaidi in Amman, Jordan, May 2015.Majdi el-Mangoush in Misurata, Libya, March 2016.\u00a0TKEgyptSee MapLaila was born into a life of both privilege and intellectual freedom. Her parents were college professors, and her older sister, Ahdaf Soueif, is one of Egypt\u2019s best-known contemporary novelists. She gravitated toward leftist politics at an early age. While studying mathematics at Cairo University in the mid-1970s, she met her future husband, Ahmed Seif, who was already the leader of an underground communist student cell calling for revolution.By then, Egypt had long been regarded as the political capital of the Middle East, the birthplace of revolutionary movements and ideas. In the modern era, it owed that status largely to the legacy of one man: Gamal Abdel Nasser.Well into the 1940s, Egypt, along with most of the rest of the Middle East, remained a lesser global concern, still in the thrall of the European powers that imposed their will on the area decades before. That began to change at the end of World War II with the discovery of vast new oil fields in the region, and with the collapse of the British and French colonial empires. The pace of change greatly accelerated when Nasser and his Free Officers Movement of junior military officers overthrew Egypt\u2019s Western-pliant king in 1952.Championing \u201cArab socialism\u201d and Pan-Arab unity, Nasser swiftly became a galvanizing figure throughout the Arab world, the spokesman for a people long dominated by foreigners and Western-educated elites. Just as crucial to the strongman\u2019s popularity was what he opposed: colonialism, imperialism and that most immediate and enduring example of the West\u2019s meddling in the region, the state of Israel.Nasser\u2019s success inspired many other would-be Arab leaders, nowhere more so than in the artificial states of the Middle East formed by the European powers. By 1968, military officers espousing the Baathist (\u201crenaissance\u201d) philosophy \u2014 a quasi-socialist form of Pan-Arabism \u2014 had seized power in Iraq and Syria. They were joined the following year by the Libyan lieutenant Muammar el-Qaddafi, and his somewhat-baffling \u201cthird universal theory,\u201d which rejected traditional democracy in favor of rule by \u201cpeople\u2019s committees.\u201d In all three countries, just as in Egypt, Western-favored monarchs or Parliaments were neutered or cast aside.But Nasser possessed an advantage that his fellow autocrats in the region did not. With a sense of national identity that stretched back millenniums, Egypt never seemed in danger of being torn apart; the centrifugal pull of tribes or clans or sectarian identity simply didn\u2019t exist there to the degree it did in Syria or Iraq. At the same time, Egypt\u2019s long tradition of relative liberalism had given rise to a fractious political landscape that ran the spectrum from secular communists to fundamentalist Islamists.Part of Nasser\u2019s genius was his ability to bridge these divides, and he did so by appealing both to Egyptian national pride and to a shared antipathy for the West, a vestige, perhaps, of 70 years of heavy-handed rule by Britain. Thus, even when Islamist conservatives became alarmed by Nas\u00adser\u2019s moves toward greater secularism, most still saw him as a hero for nationalizing Western businesses, and for besting Britain, France and Israel in the 1956 Suez crisis. Similarly, urban liberals like the Soueif family who disdained Nasser\u2019s strong-arm rule \u2014 his was a military dictatorship, after all \u2014 also cheered him for his leadership in the international Nonaligned Movement, for proudly thumbing his nose at the threats and enticements of the United States as it sought to compel Egypt into its orbit during the Cold War. This became the means by which Nasser and his successor, Anwar Sadat, maintained their grip on power: play left and right off each other as a matter of course; bring them together when needed by focusing on an external foe. Such maneuvering resulted in many odd political turns, including the first protest march of Laila Soueif.After working on leftist causes together throughout their time at the University of Cairo, Laila and Ahmed married in 1978. That same year, Egypt\u2019s political landscape was neatly turned upside down. In September, Sadat signed the Camp David accords, which led to an American-brokered peace treaty with Israel. That stunning about-face simultaneously propelled Egypt into the camp of American client-states and isolated it from much of the rest of the Arab world. Even more ominously for Sadat, what was seen in the West as an act of courage was regarded by most Egyptians as an act of betrayal and national shame. This was certainly the view of Laila and Ahmed. It was in the wake of the 1979 peace treaty that some of the men in Ahmed\u2019s underground cell began buying up arms on the black market and vowing armed action against the government. Those plans never got off the ground, though. Instead, it was a cabal of Islam\u00adist military plotters who finally got to Sadat, shooting and killing him at a military parade in Cairo in October 1981.A month later, Laila gave birth to her and Ahmed\u2019s first child, a boy they named Alaa. Their lives took on an air of increasingly apolitical domesticity, and by 1983, Laila, then 28, was juggling the demands of child-rearing with her new position as a professor of mathematics at Cairo University. All normalcy was shattered, however, when Sadat\u2019s successor, Hosni Mubarak, ordered a sweeping security crackdown. Among those ensnared in the dragnet were Ahmed and his colleagues in the underground cell. Severely tortured until he signed a full confession, Ahmed was then released to await his verdict. When that verdict was returned, in late 1984, the news was grim: Ahmed was found guilty of illegal weapons possession and sentenced to five years in prison.At the time, Laila was in France, having accepted a scholarship to further her math studies, but when Ahmed\u2019s sentence was handed down, she rushed back to Cairo with Alaa. Thanks to a curious loophole in Egyptian law, sentences for security-related offenses like Ahmed\u2019s had to be approved by the president, a process that normally took several months and during which the defendant could remain out on bail. It presented the couple with a tempting choice.\u201cWe had to decide,\u201d Laila, who is now 60, told me. \u201cDoes he submit and go into prison for five years, do we try to find some way to get him out of the country or do we go into hiding?\u201d She gave a nonchalant shrug. \u201cSo we went into hiding.\u201dFor several months, the couple lived as fugitives with their 3-year-old son. Ultimately, though, both realized it was a futile exercise. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t willing to leave the country,\u201d Laila said, \u201cand he couldn\u2019t stay in hiding forever. He decided it was easier to do the five years, so he gave himself up.\u201d But not necessarily easier for Laila. She became pregnant during her and Ahmed\u2019s brief time on the run, leaving her to tend to a second child, a girl they named Mona, as Ahmed served out his prison sentence.It was in prison that Ahmed experienced something of an epiphany. By continuing the entente with the United States and Israel that Sadat had begun, Mubarak naturally also inherited the taint of capitulation in the eyes of many of his countrymen. Unable to forge national cohesion by turning to the old external enemy card \u2014 after all, Egypt was now in bed with those supposed enemies \u2014 Mubarak had devised a more carefully calibrated system to play his secular leftist and militant Islamist oppositions against each other. Ahmed, thrown into prison with both factions, saw firsthand how this strategy played out when it came to even the most basic of human rights. As he would later tell Joe Stork of Human Rights Watch, \u201cThe communists would say secretly, \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter if Islamists are tortured.\u2019 And the Islamists would say, \u2018Why not torture communists?\u2019 \u201dDetermined to fight for judicial reform, Ahmed devoted himself to studying law in his prison cell. Within a month of his release in 1989, he was admitted to the Egyptian bar.This placed the ex-political prisoner and his wife at a crossroads. With Laila a tenured professor at Cairo University and Ahmed now a lawyer, the couple had the opportunity to carve out a comfortable existence for themselves among the Cairene elite. Instead, and at ultimately great personal cost, they would plunge ever deeper into Egypt\u2019s widening turmoils, trying to cross the very divides that had for so long been critical to the government's own survival.LibyaSee MapOver time, however, Qaddafi\u2019s rule increasingly bore less resemblance to Egypt\u2019s \u201csoft\u201d dictatorship and more to that of two others influenced by the Nasser model: the Baathist regimes of Saddam Hussein in Iraq and Hafez al-Assad in Syria. The parallels were quite striking. In all three countries, the dictators developed elaborate personality cults \u2014 their faces adorned posters and murals and postage stamps \u2014 and aligned themselves with the \u201canti-imperialist\u201d bloc of Arab nations, their stances helped along by deepening ties with the Soviet Union. True to the Baathist credo of \u201cArab socialism\u201d and Qaddafi\u2019s third universal theory, all three countries embarked on fabulously ambitious public works projects, building hospitals and schools and colleges throughout their lands and bankrolling those enterprises with oil receipts (in the cases of Libya and Iraq), or through the patronage of the Soviet Union (in the case of Syria). At the same time, the states established extravagantly bloated governmental structures, such that their ministries and agencies quickly became the main pillars of the economy; eventually more than half of the Libyan work force \u2014 Majdi el-Mangoush\u2019s parents among them \u2014 was on the government payroll, and the figures in Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq were similar. \u201cEverybody was connected to the state somehow,\u201d Majdi explained. \u201cFor their housing, for their job. It was impossible to exist outside of it.\u201dFor all their revolutionary rhetoric, the dictators of Libya, Iraq and Syria remained ever mindful that their nations were essentially artificial constructs. What this meant was that many of their subjects\u2019 primary loyalty lay not to the state but to their tribe or, more broadly, to their ethnic group or religious sect. To keep them loyal required both the carrot and the stick. In all three nations, the leaders entered into elaborate and labyrinthine alliances with various tribes and clans. Stay on the dictator\u2019s good side, and your tribe might be given control of a ministry or a lucrative business concession; fall on his bad side, and you\u2019re all out in the cold. The strongmen also carefully forged ties across ethnic and religious divides. In Iraq, even though most all senior Baathist officials were, like Saddam Hussein, of the Sunni minority, he endeavored to sprinkle just enough Shiites and Kurds through his administration to lend it an ecumenical sheen. In Hafez al-Assad\u2019s Sunni-majority Syria, rule by his Alawite minority was augmented by a de facto alliance with the nation\u2019s Christian community, giving another significant minority a stake in the status quo.This coalition-building had a unique geographic dimension in Libya. Aside from the historical rivalry that existed between the principal regions, Tripolitania and Cyrenaica, human settlement in Libya had always been clustered along the Mediterranean coast, and what developed there over the millenniums was essentially a series of semiautonomous city-states that resisted central rule. Thus, while Qaddafi didn\u2019t need to worry about religious sectarianism \u2014 virtually all Libyans are Sunni Muslims \u2014 he did need to think about drawing into his ruling circle the requisite number of Misuratans and Benghazians to keep everyone mollified.The state also had a very long memory, as Majdi el-Mangoush discovered growing up in Misurata. In 1975, two of his mother\u2019s relatives, both midlevel army officers, joined in a failed coup attempt against Qaddafi. While both were executed, that didn\u2019t remove the stain on the family name. (Testament to the enduring tribal nature of Libya, Majdi\u2019s mother was also of the Mangoush clan.)\u201cIt\u2019s not that we were directly persecuted because of it,\u201d Majdi, who is now 30, explained, \u201cbut it was something officials would always comment on: \u2018Ah, so you\u2019re a Mangoush.\u2019 It meant the government watched you a little closer, that you were never viewed as completely trustworthy.\u201dBut a perverse dynamic often takes hold in strongman dictators \u2014 and here, too, there were great similarities among Qaddafi, Hussein and Assad. Part of it stems from what might be called the naked-emperor syndrome, whereby, in the constant company of sycophants, the leader gradually becomes unmoored from reality. Another is rooted in the very nature of a police state. The greater the repression of security forces, the further that any true dissent burrows underground, making it that much harder for a dictator to know where his actual enemies are; this fuels a deepening state of paranoia, which can be assuaged only through even greater repression. By the 1990s, this cycle had produced a bizarre contradiction in Iraq, Syria and Libya: The more the leaders promoted a cult of hero worship and wallpapered their nations with their likenesses, the more reclusive those leaders became. In Majdi el-Mangoush\u2019s case, despite living in a country whose total population was less than that of New York\u2019s five boroughs, not once in 25 years did he ever personally glimpse Qaddafi. This was about the same number of times he uttered the dictator\u2019s name in a disparaging way in public. \u201cYou would only do that with family, or with the most trusted of friends,\u201d Majdi explained. \u201cIf you were around others and wanted to say something at all critical, it was \u2018our friend.\u2019 \u201dThere was another notable aspect to the posters and murals and mosaics of the dictators that could be seen everywhere in Libya, Iraq and Syria. In a great many of them, framing the image of the strongman, there appeared the outline of the country\u2019s borders. Perhaps that juxtaposition was designed to impart a simple message \u2014 \u201cI am the leader of the nation\u201d \u2014 but it\u2019s possible that the artificial-state dictators were also sending a message that was both more ambitious and more admonishing: \u201cI am the nation; and if I go, then so goes the nation.\u201d Of course, that may have been just what many members of the Mangoush clan \u2014 celebrated enough to have their own namesake neighborhood, notorious enough to be permanently marked \u2014 were secretly hoping.Tripoli, October 2002.Tripoli, October 2002.Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Tripoli, October 2002.Tripoli, October 2002.Tripoli, October 2002.KurdistanSee Map\u201cThe treaty was signed on the 6th of March,\u201d Azar Mirkhan, who is now 41, explained, \u201cand I was born on the 7th. My mother gave birth to me on the road, on the border between Iran and Iraq.\u201d He gave a rueful little laugh. \u201cThat is why my family has always called me \u2018the lucky child.\u2019 Kurdish luck.\u201dIndeed, it is hard to find any people quite as unlucky as the Kurds. Spread across the mountainous reaches of four nations \u2014 Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey \u2014 they have always regarded themselves as culturally apart from their neighbors and have constantly battled for independence from those nations they inhabit. The governments of these nations have tended to view their reluctant Kurdish subjects with both fear and distrust, and have taken turns quashing their bids for independence. Those governments have also periodically employed the Kurds \u2014 either their own or those of their neighbors \u2014 as proxy fighters to attack or unsettle their regional enemies-of-the-day. Historically, when those feuds were brought to an end, so, too, was the Kurds\u2019 usefulness, and they were soon abandoned \u2014 as occurred in the 1975 \u201cgreat betrayal.\u201dWhile the number of rebellions and proxy wars that have occurred across the breadth of Kurdistan over the past century is almost impossible to count, the biography of Heso Mirkhan\u2019s commander, Mustafa Barzani, provides something of a gauge. By the time of his death in 1979, the 75-year-old Barzani had not only waged war against Turkey, Iran (twice) and the central government of Iraq (four times), but had somehow found the energy to also take it to the Ottomans and the British and a host of Kurdish rivals. Multiply Barzani\u2019s list by four \u2014 the Kurds of Syria, Iran and Turkey have each had their own competing guerrilla groups and independence movements \u2014 and it all becomes a bit staggering.Despite the fears of these governments that they might some day be confronted by an independent \u201cgreater Kurdistan,\u201d the truth is that the differences among the Kurds in these four countries now rival their similarities. One thing they have in common, though, is a longstanding warrior tradition, and among the Kurds of northern Iraq, there is no more celebrated family of pesh merga \u2014 literally translated as \u201cthose who face death\u201d \u2014 than the Mirkhans.Following their father, Dr. Azar Mirkhan and four of his nine brothers have undergone pesh merga training; today, one brother, Araz, is a senior pesh merga commander on the front lines. But the family has paid a high price for membership in the warrior caste. Heso, the patriarch, was killed in combat in 1983, while one of Azar\u2019s older brothers, Ali, met the same end in 1994.But it hasn\u2019t been just the region\u2019s governments that have historically victimized the Kurds. In fact, few nations have brought the Kurds of northern Iraq more sorrow than the United States. After their role in the great betrayal of 1975, the Americans would again be complicit in the Kurds\u2019 suffering \u2014 if this time largely through silence \u2014 just 10 years later.By then, the United States\u2019 chief ally in the region, the shah of Iran, had been overthrown and replaced by the hostile Shiite fundamentalist government of Ayatollah Khomeini. Searching for a new partner in the region, Washington found one in Saddam Hussein. With the Iraqi dictator waging war against Khomeini\u2019s Iran, and with the United States secretly funneling weapons to his bogged-down military, by 1988 Hussein was so integral to the Reagan administration\u2019s realpolitik policy in the region that it simply looked the other way when Hussein launched the murderous Anfal campaign against his Kurdish subjects. A squalid new low was reached in March of that year, when Iraqi forces poison-gassed the Kurdish town Halabja, killing an estimated 5,000 people. Despite overwhelming evidence that Hussein was responsible for the atrocity \u2014 Halabja would figure prominently in his 2006 trial for crimes against humanity \u2014 Reagan-administration officials scurried to suggest it was actually the handiwork of Iran.What finally ended the American arrangement with Saddam Hussein was the Iraqi despot\u2019s 1990 decision to invade neighboring Kuwait, upsetting not just the Western powers but also most of his Arab neighbors. Perversely, that event very nearly led to yet another slaughter of Iraq\u2019s Kurds. Instead, it would eventually lead to their liberation, as well as mark the crucial moment when the United States propelled itself headlong into Iraq\u2019s sectarian and ethnic divides.In the face of Hussein\u2019s belligerence, President George H.W. Bush marshaled an international military coalition \u2014 Operation Desert Storm \u2014 that swiftly annihilated the Iraqi Army in Kuwait, then rolled into Iraq itself. With Hussein\u2019s government appearing on the verge of collapse, Bush encouraged the Iraqi people to rise up in revolt. Both of Iraq\u2019s marginalized communities \u2014 the Shiites in the south and the Kurds in the north \u2014 eagerly did so, only to see the United States suddenly take pause. Belatedly concluding that Hussein\u2019s demise might play into the hands of a still-hostile Iran, the Bush administration ordered American troops to stand down as the Iraqi Army regrouped and began a pitiless counterattack.To forestall a wholesale massacre of the rebels they had encouraged, the United States joined its allies in establishing a protected buffer zone in Kurdistan, as well as no-fly zones in both northern and southern Iraq. That still left Sad\u00addam Hussein in Baghdad, of course, and ready to take his revenge at the first opportunity. While the Bush administration concluded there was little it could do to aid the geographically isolated Shiites in the south \u2014 they soon suffered their own Anfal-style pogrom \u2014 to protect the Kurds, they forced Hussein to militarily withdraw from all of Kurdistan. Taking matters a step further, in July 1992 the Kurdistan Regional Government, an autonomous union of Iraq\u2019s three Kurdish provinces, was established.The Bush administration most likely regarded this Kurdish separation as a stopgap measure, to be undone once the tyrant in Baghdad had gone and the danger had passed. The long-suffering Kurds of Iraq saw it very differently. For the first time since 1919, they were free from the yoke of Baghdad, and they had their own nation in all but name. While very few in the West appreciated the significance at the time, the creation of the Kurdistan Regional Government, or K.R.G., marked the first dismantling of the colonial borders that were imposed on the region 75 years earlier, the de facto partition of one of the Middle East\u2019s artificial nations. In the years just ahead, tens of thousands of members of the Iraqi Kurdish diaspora would abandon their places of exile to return to their old homeland. In 1994, that included a 19-year-old college student, Azar Mirkhan, who had spent almost his entire life as a refugee in Iran.SyriaSee MapYet, until its demise, Homs had the distinction of being the most religiously diverse city in one of the most religiously mixed countries in the Arab world. Nationally, Syria is composed of about 70 percent Arab Sunni Muslims, 12 percent Alawites \u2014 an offshoot of Shia Islam \u2014 and a roughly equal percentage of Sunni Kurds; Christians and a number of smaller religious sects make up the rest. At the geographic crossroads of Syria, Homs reflected this ecumenical confluence, with a skyline punctuated not just by the minarets of mosques but also by the steeples of Catholic churches and the domes of Orthodox Christian ones.This gave Homs a cosmopolitan flavor not readily found elsewhere \u2014 so much so that in 1997, the Ibrahims, a Sunni couple, thought nothing of putting their first child, 5-year-old Majd, in a private Catholic school. As a result, Majd grew up with mostly Christian friends and a better knowledge of Jesus and the Bible than of Muhammad and the Quran. This didn\u2019t appear to bother Majd\u2019s parents at all. Although raised as Muslims, both were of the nominal variety, with his mother rarely even bothering to wear a head scarf in public and his father dragging himself to the mosque only for funerals.Such secular liberalism was very much in keeping with the new Syria that Hafez al-Assad sought to shape during his otherwise typically iron-fisted 30-year dictatorship, a secularism undoubtedly encouraged by his own religious minority status as an Alawite. After his death in 2000, the policy was carried on by his son, Bashar. A bland and socially awkward London-trained ophthalmologist, Bashar came to power largely by default \u2014 the Assad patriarch had been grooming his eldest son, Bassel, to take over until a fatal car accident in 1994. But Bashar, while projecting a softer, more modern face of Baathism to the outside world, also proved adroit at navigating the tricky currents of Middle Eastern politics. While still publicly vowing to recover the Golan Heights taken by Israel in the Six-Day War, he maintained an uneasy d\u00e9tente with Tel Aviv, even pursuing secret negotiations toward a settlement. By gradually loosening Syria\u2019s hold on neighboring Lebanon \u2014 its troops had occupied portions of the country since 1976, and Damascus was a prime supporter of Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah militia \u2014 the younger Assad was viewed increasingly favorably by the West.And to a young Majd Ibrahim then coming of age, it increasingly appeared that it was the West where his nation\u2019s future lay. Like other middle-class boys in Homs, he wore Western clothes, listened to Western music, watched Western videos, but Majd was also afforded a unique window onto the outside world. His father, an electrical engineer, worked at one of the best hotels in Homs, the Safir, and Majd \u2014 fascinated by the hotel, with its constant bustle of travelers \u2014 made any excuse to visit him as he went about his day. For Majd, the Safir was also a place of reassurance, a reminder that no matter what small deviations Syrian politics took along the way, he would always be able to inhabit the modern and secular world into which he was born.TKIraqSee MapYet, in the peculiar way that ambition can take root in the most inhospitable of settings, Khulood had always been determined to escape the confines of Kut, and she focused her energies on the one path that might allow for it: higher education. In this, she had an ally of sorts in her father. Ali al-Zaidi was insistent that all his children, including his three daughters, obtain college degrees, even if the ultimate purpose of the girls\u2019 education bordered on the obscure.\u201cMy father was very progressive in a lot of ways,\u201d she explained, \u201cbut even with him, going to college was never about my having a professional career. Instead, it was always the idea of \u2018Study hard, get a degree, but then find a husband.\u2019 \u201d She shrugged. \u201cThis was the Iraqi system.\u201d Khulood pursued a degree in English literature at a local university, but the expectation was that, degree in hand, she might teach English at a local school for a few years, then marry and start a family. Khulood had different plans, though: With her English proficiency, she would go to Baghdad and look for work as an interpreter for one of the few foreign companies then operating in Iraq.That scheme was sidetracked when, just three months short of her graduation, the Americans invaded Iraq. In the early morning of April 3, 2003, the fighting reached Kut. Advance units of the United States First Marine Expeditionary Force encircled the city, and for the next several hours methodically destroyed one Iraqi redoubt after another, their tanks and artillery on the ground complemented by close air support. Of this battle for her hometown, Khulood, then 23, heard a great deal but saw nothing. There was a simple explanation for this. \u201cWomen weren\u2019t allowed out of the house,\u201d she said.Before the invasion, Vice President Dick Cheney predicted that Americans would be \u201cgreeted as liberators\u201d in Iraq, and his prediction was borne out in the streets of Kut on April 4. As the Marines consolidated their hold on the city, they were happily swarmed by young men and children proffering trays of sweets and hot tea. Finally permitted to leave her home, Khulood, like most other women in Kut, observed the spectacle from a discreet distance. \u201cThe Americans were very relaxed, friendly, but mostly I was struck by how huge they seemed \u2014 and all their weapons and vehicles, too. Everything seemed out of scale, like we had been invaded by aliens.\u201dWhile there continued to be sporadic fighting elsewhere by remnants of Saddam Hussein\u2019s Baathist government \u2014 given the Orwellian label of \u201canti-Iraqi forces\u201d by the Bush administration \u2014 the few coalition troops who remained in Kut that spring and early summer felt secure enough to mingle free of body armor with residents and to patrol its streets in unprotected trucks. Those soldiers also quickly returned the city to something close to normalcy. The university was reopened after just a two-month interruption, enabling Khulood to obtain her bachelor\u2019s degree that August. The real work now was in rebuilding the nation\u2019s shattered economy and reconstituting its government, and to that end a small army of foreign engineers, accountants and consultants descended on Iraq under the aegis of the Coalition Provisional Authority, or C.P.A., the American-led transitional administration that would stand down once a new Iraqi government was in place.One of those who came was a 33-year-old lawyer from Oklahoma named Fern Holland. A human rights adviser for the C.P.A., Holland had a special brief in the summer of 2003 that included developing projects to empower women in the Shiite heartland of southern Iraq. In September 2003, that mission took her to Kut and her first encounter with Khulood.\u201cI will always remember the first time I saw Fern,\u201d Khulood said. \u201cShe brought a group of us women together to talk about the work she wanted to do in Iraq. She was surprisingly young \u2014 this is easy to forget, because her personality was so strong \u2014 with bright blond hair and a very open, friendly manner. I had never met a woman like her. I don\u2019t think any of us in that room had.\u201dWhat Holland told the women in the Kut meeting hall was no less exotic to them than her appearance. With the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, she said, a new Iraq was being established, one in which democracy and respect for human rights would reign supreme. What\u2019s more, to consolidate this new Iraq, everyone had a role to play, not least the women of Kut.For Khulood, that talk struck with the force of epiphany. This was the moment she had been waiting for her entire life. Almost immediately, she began doing volunteer work on women\u2019s rights projects for Holland. \u201cI had thought about these issues before, but under Saddam Hussein they were like fantasies,\u201d Khulood said. \u201cNow, I saw a future for myself.\u201dHolland was perhaps less confident. From past experience working in conservative and male-dominated societies in Africa, she suspected that it would only be a matter of time \u2014 and probably a very short time \u2014 before the forces of tradition rose up in opposition to her work, so she had to set change in motion quickly. She also knew that, as an outsider, her role needed to be a limited one; what was required was dynamic local women to spearhead the effort, women like Khulood al-Zaidi.The following month, Holland chose Khulood to be a representative at a national women\u2019s leadership conference, held under the auspices of the C.P.A. At that conference, Khulood received even headier news: She had been selected as part of a women\u2019s delegation that would soon travel to Washington to help draft the new Iraqi Constitution. When word of this spread at the conference, it provoked a backlash. \u201cA lot of the other women objected because I was so young,\u201d Khulood said. \u201cEven I thought it was maybe too much. But Fern insisted. She told the other women, \u2018Khulood represents the youth of Iraq \u2014 she is going.\u2019 She was my biggest supporter.\u201dOn that November 2003 trip to Washington, the 23-year-old fresh out of college met with a parade of dignitaries, including President George W. Bush. Upon her return, she was formally hired by the C.P.A. to serve as an assistant manager of the Kut media office. It was a very long way for a young woman who, less than a year earlier, had imagined no greater future than finding interpreter work with a foreign company. \u201cIt was a very exciting time,\u201d Khulood said. \u201cBecause you could feel everything changing so fast.\u201dNear Basra, March 2003.A protest in Baghdad, April 2003.Near Basra, April 2003.Near Basra, April 2003.The fall of Basra, April 2003.American soldiers in Baghdad, April 2003.IraqSee MapOnly 8 years old in 2003, Wakaz seemed destined for an exceedingly normal life, even a prosaic one. The youngest of five children born to an Iraqi bank clerk and his wife, he spent his childhood in the drowsy farming community of Dawr, just 15 miles down the Tigris River from Saddam Hussein\u2019s hometown, Tikrit. \u201cAll was very good there,\u201d he recalled. \u201cEasy.\u201dThat changed with the American invasion. Long considered a Baathist stronghold by virtue of Hussein\u2019s origins there, Tikrit and its environs were a prime early objective of the invaders, with the city itself the target of intense aerial bombardments. By mid-April 2003, coalition troops occupied the string of gaudy palace buildings erected by Hussein along the Tikrit riverfront and began conducting raids through the surrounding river towns in search of fugitive Baathist officials. The May 15 raid on Dawr netted 30 suspected Baathists \u2014 a startling number for such a small commu\u00adnity \u2014 but the town was soon to yield up an even greater prize. In mid-December 2003, American troops discovered a \u201cspider hole\u201d on the northern edge of Dawr and pulled out Hussein himself.The young Wakaz had only the vaguest grasp of all this. According to him, his family \u2014 Sunni, like most all residents of the Tikrit area \u2014 was not particularly religious, nor was it political in any way. He remembered hearing something about the mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners at an American-operated prison \u2014 clearly a reference to the Abu Ghraib scandal \u2014 and then there was the time American soldiers searched his family\u2019s home, but those soldiers were quite respectful, and the episode passed without incident.\u201cI know others had problems with the Americans,\u201d Wakaz said, \u201cbut my family, no. For us, we were really not affected at all.\u201dWhat the Hassan family did blame the invaders for, at least in a general way, was the ensuing collapse of the Iraqi economy, a downturn that cost Wakaz\u2019s father his job at the Rafidain Bank. To support his young family, the Hassan patriarch used his savings to open a small sweet shop on Dawr\u2019s main street. \u201cSo yes, our life was definitely much easier before the Americans came,\u201d Wakaz conceded. \u201cEven if it wasn\u2019t their fault directly, that is when everything became much harder.\u201dIraqSee MapIn their Iraqi war plans, the Pentagon had set down comprehensive blueprints detailing which strategic installations and government ministries were to be seized and guarded. But the American military seemed to have given little thought to the arsenals and munitions depots that Hussein had scattered about the country. In one town and city after another, these storehouses were systematically looted, sometimes under the gaze of coalition soldiers who did not intervene.The occupying authorities soon compounded this misstep. In a move now largely regarded as calamitous, one of the first actions taken by the C.P.A.\u2019s administrator, Paul Bremer, was to disband the Iraqi military. Just like that, hundreds of thousands of men \u2014 men with both military training and access to weapons \u2014 were being put out of their jobs by the summer of 2003.It may have been the edict immediately preceding that decree, however, that had the most deleterious effect. Under the terms of C.P.A. Order No. 1, senior Baath Party members were summarily dismissed from government positions and placed under a lifetime public-employment ban. In addition, employees in the upper echelon of all government institutions were to be investigated for Baathist affiliations. As critics pointed out, tens of thousands of apolitical Iraqi professionals \u2014 a group that included Khulood\u2019s radiologist father, Ali al-Zaidi \u2014 were compelled to join the party in the 1990s as part of a \u201crecruitment drive\u201d by Saddam Hussein; now these teachers and doctors and engineers were at risk of being disenfranchised.The effects of Order 1 stretched far beyond the dismissed Baathists. In Iraq, as in much of the rest of the Middle East, government offices operated on an elaborate patronage system in which most every employee, from senior staff down to the steward who brought refreshments to visitors, owed their jobs to the head man; as might be expected, that man \u2014 almost invariably a Baath Party member during Saddam Hussein\u2019s reign \u2014 usually handed out those jobs to members of his extended family or tribe. What the firing of as many as 85,000 Baathists actually meant, then, was the cashiering of countless more people and the instant impoverishment of entire clans and tribes.Under the weight of these blunders, it\u2019s remarkable that the Iraqi occupation didn\u2019t blow up sooner. An omen of what was to come occurred in August 2003, when the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad was destroyed by a truck bomb, killing 22, including the U.N.\u2019s special representative for Iraq, Sergio Vieira de Mello. That was followed by a steady escalation in attacks against coalition forces. By the beginning of 2004, C.P.A. officials perceived a deepening hostility toward their initiatives, so much so that even Fern Holland began to worry. As she wrote in an email to a friend in late January: \u201cWe\u2019re doing all we can with the brief time we\u2019ve got left. It\u2019s a terrible race. Wish us luck. Wish the Iraqis luck.\u201dOn March 8, 2004, the new provisional Constitution of Iraq was signed. The clause that set a goal of having 25 percent of future parliamentary seats held by women was largely credited to the behind-the-scenes lobbying of Fern Holland.The following afternoon, a Daewoo containing three C.P.A. civilian employees was traveling along a provincial highway when an Iraqi police pickup truck pulled alongside. With a blast of automatic gunfire, the car was sent careering across the highway before stalling on the shoulder; the men in the police truck then clambered out to finish off their victims with assault rifles. All three of the Daewoo's occupants were killed in the fusillade, marking them as the first C.P.A. civilians to be murdered in Iraq. That included the driver and presumed target of the attack, Fern Holland.Following Holland\u2019s murder, a sense of trepidation spread among the thousands of C.P.A. personnel scattered across Iraq. \u201cWe were all in a state of shock, of course,\u201d Khulood al-Zaidi said, \u201cbut I think we were also waiting to see what it meant, if it had been an attack on Fern in particular or if this was going to be something larger.\u201dThe answer came very soon. In tandem with the growing Sunni insurgency in central Iraq, through the first months of 2004, a radical Shiite cleric in Baghdad, Moktada al-Sadr, had been demanding a withdrawal of all coalition forces from the nation. In early April, Sadr unleashed his militia, the Mahdi Army, in an effort to bring that withdrawal about through a series of well-coordinated attacks against military and C.P.A. installations. Kut\u2019s turn came on April 5, when some 200 Mahdi militiamen began attacking the C.P.A. compound.Khulood spent hours trapped in the C.P.A. media office, as the coalition forces assigned to guard the compound returned fire. Finally a C.P.A. supervisor turned to Khulood. \u201cIf you are not afraid,\u201d he said, \u201cyou should just go.\u201dWith two other local workers, Khulood managed to thread her way out of the compound and, dodging down side alleys, to escape. With the C.P.A. compound subsequently abandoned, she remained in hiding as the Mahdi militiamen who now controlled Kut searched for any local C.P.A. employees left behind. Even after Ameri\u00adcan forces retook the city, Khulood remained so frightened she didn\u2019t leave her family\u2019s home for two weeks.The Mahdi uprising radically altered the flow of events in Iraq. Both Sunni and Shia militias sharply increased their attacks against coalition forces, marking the true beginning of the Iraq war. Despite this, the C.P.A. went ahead with their program of ceding control of Iraq to a new central government. In May, the last of the foreign civilians based in Kut began withdrawing, and within two months, the whole of the local C.P.A. infrastructure was placed under the authority of the new Baghdad government.For a time, this did seem to calm passions in Khulood\u2019s hometown, enough so that she vowed to continue the women\u2019s rights initiatives begun by her murdered mentor. That autumn, she helped found a small nongovernmental organization called Al-Batul, or Virgin. Its goals were modest. \u201cKut has a small Christian population,\u201d Khulood explained, \u201cso my idea was to bring Christian and Muslim women together to work on projects that were important to both communities. It was mainly to teach the women how to defend their rights, to show them that they didn\u2019t always have to obey what men said.\u201dBut in the deepening sectarianism spreading across Iraq, Sunni and Shia militants alike increasingly viewed the Christian community as the infidels within; in turn, terrified Christians were beginning to abandon the nation in droves, an exodus that would eventually reduce their numbers in Iraq by more than two-thirds. Further, the only possible source of funding for an endeavor like Al-Batul was from the foreign occupiers, enabling militants to denounce it as a front in the service of the enemy. Almost immediately, Khulood began receiving anonymous threats for continuing her work on \u201cAmerican issues,\u201d threats that escalated to the point where she was denounced by name in a local newspaper.The memory of that time caused Khulood, now 36, to become somber, reflective. \u201cI can see now that I was quite na\u00efve, that I didn\u2019t take the situation as seriously as I should have. But my feeling was that I was only working on things that might give women a better life, so how was I a threat?\u201dIn October 2004, the Al-Batul office in Kut was shot up. Undeterred, Khulood rented a second office, only to have it looted. That January, while attending a human rights training seminar in Amman, the capital of neighboring Jordan, she received a warning: If she resumed her work in Kut, she would be killed. She remained in Jordan for three months, but in April 2005 \u2014 a year after the death of Fern Holland and with the fighting in Iraq now spiraling into sectarian war \u2014 Khulood finally slipped back to her hometown.She recognizes now that this decision bordered on the foolhardy. \u201cIt was just very difficult for me to give up on this dream I had for Iraq,\u201d Khulood said, recalling how Holland told her that \u201cto bring change it takes people with courage, that sometimes you have to push very hard. Well, I didn\u2019t want to die, but Fern had, and I think I held onto this hope that if we kept trying, maybe things would improve.\u201dShortly after returning to Kut, Khulood went to the local police station to file a report about her looted office, only to be treated dismissively. A more ominous note was struck when she met with one of her old Al-Batul colleagues. \u201cWhy did you come back here?\u201d the woman asked. \u201cEveryone knows you\u2019re working for the Ameri\u00adcan Embassy.\u201d Her colleague\u2019s accusation came on the heels of a call summoning Khulood to the local militia headquarters. \u201cThat\u2019s when I finally saw there was no chance for me in Iraq, that if I tried any longer, they would surely kill me.\u201dEgyptSee MapBy then, Laila and her husband, Ahmed Seif, had been Egypt\u2019s most celebrated political dissident couple for well over a decade, serving as constant nuisances to the Mubarak government. Since his release from prison in 1989, Ahmed had become the nation\u2019s pre-eminent human rights lawyer, the champion of an eclectic array of defendants in politically motivated cases that included leftist university professors, Islamic fundamentalists and \u2014 in a nation where homosexuality remains effectively illegal \u2014 members of Cairo\u2019s gay community. When I first met him that autumn, Ahmed was involved in perhaps the most controversial case of his career, defending a group of men accused of complicity in a 2004 hotel bombing in the Sinai Peninsula that left 31 dead.For her part, and even while retaining her mathematics professorship at Cairo University, Laila had gained a reputation as one of Cairo\u2019s most indefatigable \u201cstreet\u201d leaders, the veteran of countless protest marches against the government. Part of what drove her was a keen awareness that, as a member of the Cairene professional class, she enjoyed a freedom to dissent that was all but denied to Egypt\u2019s poor and working class. \u201cHistorically,\u201d she said, \u201cthat bestowed a degree of immunity \u2014 the security forces really didn\u2019t like to mess with us, because they didn\u2019t know who in the power structure we could call up \u2014 but that also meant we had a responsibility, to be a voice for those who are silenced. And being a woman helped, too. In this culture, women just aren\u2019t taken that seriously, so it allows you to do things that men can\u2019t.\u201dBut she was also quite aware that her activism \u2014 and the government\u2019s grudging tolerance of it \u2014 fit neatly into the divide-and-rule strategy that Hosni Mubarak had employed since assuming power in 1981. In the past, Egyptian governments were able to gin up bipartisan support when needed by playing the anti-West, anti-Israel card, but Anwar Sadat traded that card away by making peace with Israel and going on the American payroll. The new strategy consisted of allowing an expanded level of political dissent among the small, urban educated class, while swiftly moving to crush any sign of growing influence by the far more numerous \u2014 and therefore, far more dangerous \u2014 Islamists.In Laila\u2019s estimation, what finally caused this strategy to fray was the launch of the second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, against Israel in September 2000. With most Egyptians of all politi\u00adcal persuasions holding that their government sold out the Palestinians with the 1979 peace treaty with Israel, Mubarak was suddenly powerless to muzzle pro-Palestinian demonstrations lest he be seen as an even greater lackey of the Americans. \u201cFor the first time,\u201d Laila explained, \u201cwe began organizing openly and publicly without taking any permission from the government and without taking cover under any of the so-called legitimate political parties. And what was the government going to do about it? This established the pattern \u2014 you don\u2019t wait for permission, you don\u2019t look for an existing political party to take you in, you just organize \u2014 that we used many, many times afterward.\u201dIn short order, street protests became a constant feature of Egyptian life. Even more dele\u00adterious from the government\u2019s point of view, fury over the Palestinian situation galvanized opposition groups from across the political spectrum to march and work together.With this new dynamic in place, the last thing Hosni Mubarak needed was another reminder to the Egyptian people of his fealty to Washington \u2014 but then came the United States\u2019 decision to invade Iraq.While astute enough to oppose that invasion in public, and to engage in high-profile diplo\u00admacy to try to head it off, Mubarak wasn\u2019t able to escape its fallout. In the eyes of many Egyptians, after 23 years of taking lucre from the Americans, the dictator was simply too much their puppet to make a show of independence now. That cynical view only hardened as the war in Iraq dragged on and the daily body count mounted. From 2002 through early 2005, some of the largest antiwar demonstrations in the Arab world were taking place in the streets of Cairo, and Laila Soueif was on the front lines in nearly every one of them. \u201cOf course, on the overt level it was to protest what was occurring in Iraq,\u201d Laila said, \u201cbut this also reflected the failure of Mubarak.\u201dAt the same time, the dictator did himself few favors with a series of domestic initiatives that further inflamed the opposition. Grooming his son Gamal as his successor, in February 2005 Mubarak engineered a rewriting of the Constitution that, while ostensibly allowing for direct presidential elections, actually rigged the system so as to make domination by his political party all but perpetual. In presidential elections that September, Mubarak won a fifth six-year term with nearly 89 percent of the vote, after having arrested the only notable candidate to stand against him, Ayman Nour. Under mounting pressure at home and abroad, he reduced his interference in the November 2005 parliamentary elections, only to see the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist party still officially banned, take an unprecedented 20 percent of the seats.By late 2005, when I spent six weeks traveling through Egypt, growing contempt for the government was evident everywhere. To be sure, much of that antipathy derived from the nation\u2019s economic stagnation and from the corruption that had enabled a small handful of politicians and generals to become fabulously rich \u2014 the Mubarak family financial portfolio alone was reported to run into the billions \u2014 but it also had a strong anti-American component, and pointed up a profound disjuncture. At the same time that Egypt was regarded in Washington as one of the United States\u2019 most reliable allies in the Arab world, in no small part because of its continuing entente with Israel, over the course of scores of interviews with Egyptians of most every political and religious persuasion, I failed to meet a single one who supported the Israeli peace settlement, or who regarded the American subsidies to the Mubarak government, then approaching $2 billion a year, as anything other than a source of national shame. As Essam el-Erian, deputy head of the Muslim Brotherhood, bluntly told me: \u201cThe only politics in Egypt now are the politics of the street, and for anyone to work with the Americans is to write their politi\u00adcal death sentence.\u201dIt was during this time of ferment that the three children of Laila Soueif and Ahmed Seif, who previously had shown little interest in activism, began to have a change of heart about politics. The first to make the evolution was their son, Alaa, a pioneering Egyptian blogger, and it happened when he accompanied Laila to a protest march in May 2005.\u201cHe had become very interested in citizen journalism,\u201d Laila said, \u201cso with all the street actions surrounding the Constitution and Mubarak running again, he had begun coming down to cover the demonstrations \u2014 not to participate, just to report on them.\u201dLaila Soueif is a tough, unsentimental woman, and if she harbored any pride \u2014 or, in light of what was to come, regret \u2014 over her children\u2019s turn to activism, she didn\u2019t let on. \u201cI never tried to dissuade them. Even if I had wanted to \u2014 and I probably did at times \u2014 I didn\u2019t. That kind of thing is useless. They\u2019re not going to listen to you anyway, so you just get into fights.\u201dRefugees fleeing Israeli airstrikes in Tyre, July 2006.Moments after an Israeli airstrike in Tyre, July 2006.Civilians fleeing in southern Lebanon, July 2006.After an Israeli airstrike in Qana, July 2006.A wounded Hezbollah fighter in Tyre, August 2006.After an Israeli airstrike in Beirut, August 2006.After an Israeli airstrike in Beirut, August 2006.A mass burial in Tyre, July 2006.LibyaSee MapAlong Tripoli Street, one of the city\u2019s main thoroughfares, a municipal work crew with a cherry-picker was methodically taking down the posters of Muammar el-Qaddafi that hung from every lamppost.It was part of an attempt by the Libyan dictator to put a kinder, gentler face on his government. While ostensibly directed at the Libyan people, the campaign was really meant for Western consumption.In the days leading up to the invasion of Iraq, there had been talk in President George W. Bush\u2019s inner circle that once Saddam Hussein was dispensed with, the troublesome Qaddafi would be next. Once the Iraq invasion began in March 2003, the Libyan dictator hurried to make amends with the Americans. He offered a settlement over his country\u2019s role in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland \u2014 without explicitly admitting guilt, the Libyan government agreed to set aside $2.7 billion in compensation to the families of the 270 victims \u2014 and began quietly dismantling his nation\u2019s fledgling program for chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. Even more quietly, Libyan intelligence agents shared dossiers with their American counterparts on suspected Al Qaeda operatives and other Islamic fundamentalists in the region. On the home front, the goal was to create at least the illusion of political liberalization, and one aspect was to remove some of the tens of thousands of posters and billboards of \u201cthe Leader\u201d that wallpapered the nation.Qaddafi soon thought better of the whole egalitarian makeover. By 2006, the United States had restored full diplomatic relations with his government; while officially a response to the abandonment of the Libyan unconven\u00adtional-weapons program, certainly a contributing factor was that, amid the deepening quagmire of the Iraqi misadventure, there was not going to be any grand American crusade against the region\u2019s other dictators. Which also meant that Qaddafi could quietly abandon his reform drive. \u201cIt was just a bit of theater,\u201d Majdi said. \u201cNothing really changed, and after a few months, I don\u2019t think anyone even remembered it.\u201dBut that day hadn\u2019t yet arrived when the cherry-picker made its way down Misurata\u2019s Tripoli Street. Majdi was still observing the spectacle when an elderly man emerged from a nearby alley.For a long moment, the old man stared slack-jawed in amazement at the sight before him. He then rushed over to one of the discarded posters, removed a shoe and \u2014 in a gesture of insult common throughout the Arab world \u2014 began beating it against Qaddafi\u2019s likeness amid a torrent of curses.A municipal worker came over to ask what he was doing.\u201cThe bastard\u2019s gone at last, no?\u201d the old man asked. \u201cThere\u2019s been a coup?\u201dWhen the worker set him straight, the man stammered out an explanation for his behavior \u2014 he\u2019d been very ill lately, given to fits of lunacy \u2014 and then hurried away.Jordan \u2022 United States \u2022 IraqSee MapOne evening that September, as Wisam and a friend walked along a Kut street, someone with an assault rifle killed them both in a burst of gunfire. \u201cHe was 25,\u201d Khulood said softly. \u201cSome people say he was killed because of the work I was doing, but I hope that isn\u2019t true.\u201dA few months after Wisam\u2019s murder, Khulood faced a new ordeal when, working for an NGO, she rebuffed the demands of a corrupt but well-placed Jordanian businessman looking for kickbacks. He was the wrong person to cross. Shortly after, she was ordered to leave Jordan. Facing almost-certain death if forced to return to Iraq, Khulood turned to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for emergency resettlement in a third country.Among the more unlikely possibilities for resettlement was the United States. In 2008, American troops were still embroiled in an Iraqi civil war, and the Bush administration had strict caps in place (albeit recently loosened) on the number of Iraqis to be given refuge; to let in all those who had fled the country \u2014 and there were an estimated half-million displaced Iraqis in Jordan alone \u2014 would belie its talking point that the corner had finally been turned in the war. In light of the grave danger Khulood faced, how\u00adever, the U.N.H.C.R. placed her in its own special program, reserved for only the most vulnerable of refugees, and for those in this pool, the Americans had a spot available. In July 2008, Khulood boarded a plane bound for San Francisco.It\u2019s hard to imagine a more extreme transition, from the cramped, tumbledown apartment she shared with her father and two sisters in Amman to a pleasant one-bedroom in San Francisco, and Khulood reveled in her new life. \u201cJust to have the freedom to go wherever I wanted, and to not think something bad might happen to me. And I don\u2019t mean just the war. For a woman to travel alone in Iraq \u2014 maybe it happened in Baghdad, but never in Kut, and so some days I would just take a bus or the metro for hours. It was something I had never really imagined before.\u201dHer career prospects were also much improved. In Iraq, Khulood studied English because it seemed to offer the greatest chance at future freedom for a young woman, but in the United States the opportunities were endless. \u201cAfter one year, I would get my green card, and then I could apply for scholarships to study whatever I wanted. I became very ambitious.\u201dThe one continuing source of worry was for her divided family back in Iraq and Jordan. While she knew those in Kut wouldn\u2019t leave, Khulood was desperate to release her father and sisters from their limbo existence in Amman and, soon after reaching San Francisco, she started the paperwork to have them join her.Three months later, Khulood received both good and bad news. Her two sisters were approved for resettlement. Their father, how\u00adever, was rejected. The sisters remained in Jordan while the family appealed the decision, but Ali al-Zaidi was rejected again.By February 2009, seven months after Khulood\u2019s arrival in San Francisco, there was still no progress in the effort to resettle her father. It was then she made a fateful decision: She would return to Jordan and work on his case there.\u201cMy friends in San Francisco couldn\u2019t understand it,\u201d she recalled. \u201cWhy, when you have a new life here, why would you ever go back?\u201d Khulood grew thoughtful for a moment, as if still struggling for an answer. \u201cBut how to explain my culture to them? In Iraq, family is the most important thing, you can never turn away from it, so how could I and my sisters enjoy this nice life in America but leave our father behind? We could never live with the shame of that.

Nothing worked.Worse, Khulood had walked herself into legal limbo. As she was warned before leaving San Francisco, under the stipulations of American immigration law, refugees awaiting the permanent status of a green card cannot leave the country for longer than six months. By returning \u2014 and staying \u2014 in Jordan, Khulood had lost her refugee classification. Now, along with the part of her family that she had brought out of Iraq, Khulood was stranded. She could not go home or to a third country, hostage to the whim of a state \u2014 Jordan \u2014 that was anxious to shed her.A M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res facility for Iraqi refugees in Amman, Jordan, February 2008.M.S.F. facility in Amman, February 2008.M.S.F. facility in Amman, February 2008.M.S.F. facility in Amman, February 2008.M.S.F. facility in Amman, February 2008.Iraqi refugees in Damascus, Syria, February 2008.Iraqi refugee in Damascus, February 2008.Iraqi refugee in Damascus, February 2008.SyriaSee Map\u201cI can never remember my father saying anything about the regime, good or bad,\u201d Majd Ibrahim said. \u201cAnd I never remember any of my relatives or neighbors doing it either. When it came to the state, the most anyone would criticize was maybe the corrupt traffic policeman at the corner. You just didn\u2019t talk about that stuff with anyone.\u201dBecause of his liberal upbringing, Majd experienced a shock when he left his Catholic school at the end of the ninth grade and transferred into a state high school. His modern and secular ways often estranged him from his more Islamist-minded classmates, and the instruction was abysmal. But high school is a bad time for a lot of people, and Majd\u2019s life brightened considerably upon graduating in summer 2010. While failing to obtain the high marks on the national exam that would have enabled him to pursue one of the \u201chigher\u201d professions \u2014 engineering or medicine \u2014 he did sufficiently well to enter Al-Baath University in Homs that autumn to pursue a degree in hotel management.This was undoubtedly a better fit for Majd regardless. The handsome, outgoing young man had a natural charm that enabled him to develop a quick rapport with most anyone, joined to an intense curiosity about the larger world beyond Homs. With his degree in hand, he envisioned a future at one of the luxury hotels in Damascus \u2014 they \u201crepresented one of the best ways to advance,\u201d he said, \u201cto have a good life.\u201dBut there was another feature of his hometown that Majd had probably scarcely given thought to in his short life: In almost every way, Homs truly was the crossroads of Syria. Located near the midpoint of the highway between the nation\u2019s two largest cities, Damascus and Aleppo, Homs was also the eastern terminus of the highway linking Syria\u2019s interior to its coastal provinces. Just as significant, it was the hub of the nation\u2019s gas- and oil-refinery industry \u2014 quite logically, since the pipelines leading from the oil and natural-gas fields in the eastern deserts passed directly through the city on their way to the coast. If all this served to make Homs a prosperous town, it also meant that, in the event of a war, it was a place all sides would fight furiously to control.By the time Majd started at Al-Baath University, that war was just months away.TKEgyptSee MapThe following day, as Laila approached Tahrir Square, she realized this indeed was something altogether different from the toothless Egyptian protests of the past. Until now, the Cairene activist community had considered a protest successful if it drew several hundred demonstrators. In Tahrir Square on Jan. 25, the crowd was at least 15,000, and Laila soon heard about the many thousands more who had converged on different rallying points around Cairo and in other towns and cities across Egypt. In Tahrir, as elsewhere around the nation, the stunned security forces simply stepped aside, as the emboldened crowds\u2019 calls for reform gave way to open demands for Hosni Mubarak\u2019s fall.The protests continued over the next two days, until, on Jan. 28, Laila concluded that they truly did have a revolution on their hands. That morning, she and some friends traveled to the Imbaba neighborhood in northwest Cairo to join a group intending to march on Tahrir, only to be met by a wall of soldiers in riot gear. After dispersing the protesters, the soldiers pursued them into Imbaba\u2019s narrow alleyways, firing tear gas as they went.\u201cThat was a very stupid mistake,\u201d Laila explained. \u201cThese are small alleys where people are practically living in the street, so that just brought down Imbaba. It became a fixed battle between the troops and the residents, and there was absolutely no moving those people. They were going to break down these soldiers and torch the police stations, or die trying.\u201dThe battle for Imbaba continued late into the afternoon. Laila, having become separated from her friends, decided to walk to downtown alone. It was an eerie journey. The streets were deserted, and fires raged in the growing dusk: cars, barricades, police stations burning. Echoing off the surrounding buildings came the sound of gunfire, some single shots, others the sustained bursts of assault rifles. With darkness falling, Laila finally emerged onto Ramses Street, a major thoroughfare in central Cairo.\u201cAnd suddenly, this huge crowd of demonstrators appeared,\u201d she recalled, \u201crunning down Ramses. They had just broken through the police cordons, and they were running to get to Tahrir. One young man saw me standing there, and he came over and hugged me \u2014 he\u2019d obviously seen me before, in Tahrir \u2014 and said, \u2018I told you we would have a revolution!\u2019 And that was the moment when I knew it was true, and that we would be victorious.\u201dOver the next week, both the size and the militancy of the demonstrations grew, but so did the harshness of the government\u2019s response, with soldiers and the police increasingly trading tear gas for live ammunition. On Feb. 1, a defiant Mubarak took to the airwaves vowing never to leave Egypt \u2014 \u201cOn its soil I will die\u201d \u2014 and the following day there came the bizarre spectacle, called the Battle of the Camel, when scores of state-\u00adsponsored thugs astride horses and camels attacked those encamped in Tahrir Square with riding crops and whips.The following day, Ahmed Seif\u2019s law center was raided by the military police, and he and dozens of others were hauled off for questioning at the headquarters of military intelligence. For two days, Ahmed was interrogated by a variety of officers, but he would have reason to recall one encounter in particular. It came on the morning of Feb. 5, when the chief of military intelligence, a colorless general named Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, going about other business, happened to stride past Ahmed and several other prisoners. In an impromptu lecture, Sisi warned his captive audience that they should all respect Mubarak and Egypt\u2019s military leadership and that, once released, they should go home and forget Tahrir Square. When Ahmed, forgoing respectful silence, retorted that Mubarak was corrupt, the general\u2019s haughty manner swiftly changed. \u201cHe became angry; his face became red,\u201d Ahmed recalled a few years later to The Guardian. \u201cHe acted as if every citizen would accept his point and no one would reject it in public. When he was rejected in public, he lost it.\u201dUpon his release that day, Ahmed stopped by his home for a change of clothes and then immediately returned to Tahrir Square.It soon became clear that the regime was losing control. Across Egypt came reports of army units refusing orders to fire on demonstrators, and in Tahrir Square television cameras captured images of soldiers embracing the protesters and sharing cigarettes with them.On Feb. 11, the clock finally ran out on Hosni Mubarak. After submitting his resignation, the president and his immediate family boarded a plane and fled to their palatial retreat in the Red Sea resort town Sharm el Sheikh. At the news, all of Egypt erupted in celebration, and nowhere more so than in Cairo\u2019s Tahrir Square.But among a small handful of Egyptians, joy was already tinged with a note of disquiet, especially when it was announced that a group of senior military officers, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, or SCAF, would serve as an interim government until elections were held. One of those who worried was Laila Soueif.\u201cIn the last few days of Mubarak,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen we could see what was coming, I and some of the other independents, we tried to talk to all the different political factions. \u2018Seize power. Don\u2019t wait for permission. Just seize power now before the military steps in.\u2019 And everyone said: \u2018Yes, of course, that\u2019s a good idea. We\u2019ll organize a meeting to talk about it in a couple of days.\u2019 \u201d Laila shook her head, gave a bitter little laugh. \u201cBut maybe it was asking too much. Maybe we simply couldn\u2019t do it at that point. People needed to feel they had won. Not us, the politicos, but all these millions of people who had come down to the street. They needed a time to feel victorious.\u201d She sighed, and then fell silent for a moment. \u201cI don\u2019t know. To this day, I don\u2019t know. But I think that was our critical moment, and we lost.\u201dNear Tahrir Square in Cairo, February 2011.Tahrir Square, February 2011.Tahrir Square, February 2011.Near Tahrir Square, February 2011.Tahrir Square, February 2011.Near Tahrir Square, February 2011.Near Tahrir Square, February 2011.Tahrir Square, February 2011.LibyaSee Map\u201cThat\u2019s when we knew something big had happened,\u201d Majdi recalled, \u201cbecause this was unlike anything we\u2019d seen before. But still, no one would tell us what was going on.\u201dMajdi hoped he would get an explanation when classes resumed the next morning, but the civilian instructors failed to show up. Throughout that day, Majdi stayed in the constant company of his best friend at the academy, Jalal al-\u00adDrisi, a 23-year-old cadet from Benghazi. In contrast to the shy Majdi, Jalal, wiry and quick on his feet, was always ready with an irreverent joke or an elaborate prank. What the two shared was a fascination with science and gadgetry \u2014 Jalal was studying aviation weaponry \u2014 and over the course of the previous two and a half years, they had become inseparable. Jalal frequently spent his weekend leaves at the Mangoush family home in Misurata, a hospitality that was reciprocated when Majdi spent part of the summer of 2009 with the Drisis in Benghazi. In the bizarre news-free environment that existed at the academy, the young men tried to puzzle out what was happening.Over the next two days, the gunfire beyond the walls continued sporadically. The sound would draw near at times, only to recede; intense exchanges would be followed by long periods of quiet.No sooner did Qaddafi\u2019s address end than the gunfire in Misurata significantly escalated. \u201cIt was like the security forces had been awaiting orders for what to do,\u201d Majdi said. \u201cAfter the speech, they just opened up everywhere.\u201dThe cadets remained quarantined; they were besieged by elements outside the compound walls whose goals they weren\u2019t allowed to know and kept within those walls by soldiers who clearly didn\u2019t trust them. As the days passed and the unseen gun battles raged, the students lounged around their barracks wondering what was to become of them. It was virtually all Majdi el-\u00adMangoush and Jalal al-\u00adDrisi could talk about. \u201cWe would sit together for hours and go over every little detail, every clue we had picked up,\u201d Majdi said. \u201c \u2018What did it mean? Did it mean anything?\u2019 But sometimes it got to be too much. We had to stop. We had to talk about football or girls, anything to distract us.\u201dTheir peculiar limbo ended on the night of Feb. 25, when soldiers of the elite 32nd Brigade suddenly appeared on the base. Announcing that they had come from Tripoli to \u201crescue\u201d the cadets, the commandos ordered the students to gather their things and run to a gathering point at the edge of the compound where buses were waiting.Someone in the vaunted 32nd had made a logistical error, however. To transport the 580 cadets, just two buses had been ordered. With each vehicle filled to bursting, the excess students were crammed wherever they might fit in the brigade\u2019s jeeps and armored cars, and then the convoy trundled into the night for the long journey to Tripoli.Beyond effecting their \u201crescue\u201d from Misurata, the regime in Tripoli didn\u2019t really seem to know what to do with its young charges either. Bused to a vacant military high school compound on the southern outskirts of the city, the cadets were billeted in barrack halls and empty classrooms but barred from leaving or having any contact with their families. That edict was enforced by armed soldiers posted at the gates.But the confines of the Tripoli high school were a good deal more porous than those of the air force academy, and from their minders the cadets gradually learned something of the conflict that had befallen their nation. Although the unrest was fomented by criminal gangs and foreign mercenaries in the hire of Libya\u2019s Western enemies, they were told, misguided segments of the population had joined in to spread it. By the beginning of March, this foreign-\u00adspawned criminality was most intense in Misurata and Benghazi, and both cities had become pitched battlegrounds.Provided with this narrative, Majdi was not altogether surprised when, in mid-March, Western alliance warplanes began appearing over Tripoli to bomb government installations. It seemed merely to confirm that the nation was being attacked from beyond. Naturally, the situation also caused both Majdi and Jalal to worry about the fate of their hometowns and wonder which of their friends might have been seduced into joining the traitors\u2019 ranks. \u201cThat\u2019s something we talked about a lot,\u201d Majdi said. \u201c \u2018Oh, Khalid was always a little crazy; I bet he\u2019s gone with them.\u2019 \u201dThe cadets seemed gradually to win the trust of the regime, enough for one large group to be transferred to a military base in mid-\u00adApril to begin training on missile-\u00adguidance systems. Neither Majdi nor Jalal were selected for this mission, however, and their stay at the high school dragged on. Then one day in early May, Majdi ran into an old acquaintance at the barracks. The acquaintance, Mohammed, was now a military intelligence officer. He wanted to talk to Majdi about Misurata. The two chatted for some time, with Mohammed asking about different locations in the city and if the young cadet might know who the town\u2019s \u201ccivic leaders\u201d were. Majdi thought nothing of the conversation, but one afternoon a few days later, he was called to headquarters.There, an officer informed Majdi that he had been selected to join the cadets undergoing missile-\u00adguidance training; the jeep that would transport him to the base was leaving immediately. So hurried was his departure that Majdi didn\u2019t even have time to say goodbye to Jalal.But the jeep driver didn\u2019t take him to the army base. Instead, he followed the Tripoli ring road to the coastal highway and then turned east.By early evening, they had reached Ad Dafiniyah, the last town before Misurata and the farthest limits of government control. There, Majdi was led into a small farmhouse, where he was told someone wanted to speak to him on the phone. It was Mohammed, the military intelligence officer.As Mohammed explained, the young air force cadet had been chosen for a \u201cspecial patriotic mission\u201d: He was to slip into Misurata and find out who the rebel leaders were and where they lived. Once he had done this, he would pass the information to a liaison officer secreted within Misurata, a man named Ayoub. To make contact with Ayoub, Majdi was given a Thuraya satellite phone and a number to call.Upon hearing all this, Majdi had two thoughts. One was about his friends at home: Ever since hearing about the scale of fighting in Misurata, he assumed that some of his friends must have joined the other side. If he carried out this mission, it might very well result in their deaths.The other thought was of a recent conversation he had with Jalal. His friend had awoken in a despondent state of mind, explaining that he\u2019d had a terrible dream, and it took Majdi some time to coax out the details. \u201cI dreamt that you and I were sent to fight in Misurata,\u201d Jalal finally revealed, \u201cand that you were killed.\u201dBut any hesitation swiftly passed. In his goldfish-\u00adbowl existence in Tripoli, Majdi had heard only what the regime wanted him to hear, and if he didn\u2019t believe all of it, he believed enough of it to want to help defeat the foreigners and their followers who were destroying Libya, even if this included people he knew. Perhaps most of all, he just wanted the limbo to end. For nearly three months, he had been cut off from both his family and the outside world, and he simply wanted something \u2014 anything \u2014 to happen. So he agreed.Early the next morning, Majdi said goodbye to his companions at the farmhouse and headed alone into no man\u2019s land. Misurata lay some 10 miles to the east. In the right front pocket of his pants he carried his military identification card. If stopped by the rebels, this card in itself was unlikely to cause him problems; countless government soldiers had deserted, and the fact that Majdi was from Misurata would certainly lend credence to his explanation that he was trying only to go home. The satellite phone in his left pocket was a very different matter, though. With the severing of internet and cellphone reception, the Thuraya had become the standard mode of communication for regime operatives in the field, and if the rebels discovered Majdi\u2019s \u2014 sure to be found in the most cursory of searches \u2014 they would inevitably conclude that he was coming into Misurata as a spy. Under those circumstances, summary execution was probably the most merciful outcome he could hope for.As he walked, the sound of gunfire grew in intensity, and there was the occasional rumble of distant artillery explosions. But between the light wind and the rolling-\u00adhill topography of the Misurata coastal shelf, it was quite impossible for Majdi to determine how close any of it was or even its direction. He tried to bear in mind something he picked up in basic training, that the most worrisome noise on a battlefield wasn\u2019t gunshots but rather a soft popping sound, like the snapping of fingers. This was the sound the air made as it rejoined behind a bullet, and you heard it only when a bullet passed close to your head.Majdi\u2019s memory of that journey is vague. He doesn\u2019t remember how long it took; he estimates that he walked for about three hours, but it could have been shorter or twice as long. Only one moment sticks out in his mind. About halfway across no man\u2019s land, Majdi was suddenly filled with a sense of joy unlike anything he had ever experienced before.\u201cI can\u2019t really describe it,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019ve never had a feeling like it since, but I was just so happy, so completely at peace with everything.\u201d He fell silent for a time, groping for an explanation. \u201cI think it\u2019s because I was in the one place where I was out from the shadow of others. I hadn\u2019t betrayed my friends yet, I hadn\u2019t betrayed my country yet \u2014 that is what lay ahead \u2014 so as long as I stayed out there, I was free.\u201dSyriaSee MapShortly after that interview, however, Syria\u2019s state-\u00adcontrolled media went silent on the whole topic. Certainly there was scant mention when, in early March, demonstrators took to the streets of the southern Syrian city Dara\u2019a to protest the arrest and reported torture of a group of high-school students for writing anti-\u00adgovernment graffiti on walls. \u201cI heard about what happened in Dara\u2019a through social media,\u201d Majd said, \u201cfrom Facebook and YouTube.\u201dIt was from the same venues that Majd learned of a solidarity protest, called the Day of Dignity, that was to take place in front of the Khaled bin al-\u00adWaleed Mosque in downtown Homs on March 18. Heeding the admonitions of his parents, Majd stayed well away from that rally, but he heard through friends that hundreds of demonstrators had shown up, watched over by a nearly equal number of police officers and state security personnel. It was a shocking story to the 18-year-old college student; Homs had simply never experienced anything like it.And that demonstration was tiny in comparison with the next, held a week later. This time, the protesters numbered in the thousands. Majd, figuring there was safety in numbers amid the throngs of onlookers, managed to get close enough to hear their demands: for political reform, greater civil rights, a repeal of the state-\u00adof-\u00ademergency edict that had been in place in Syria for the previous 48 years.On March 30, Assad delivered a speech to the Syrian Parliament, carried live by state television and radio outlets. While protests had spread to a number of Syrian cities, they were still largely peaceful, with dissenters calling for changes in the regime rather than for its overthrow. As a result \u2014 and with the assumption that the regime had learned something from the recent collapse of the Tunisian and Egyptian governments and the widening chaos in Libya \u2014 many expected Assad to take a conciliatory approach.That expectation was also based on Assad\u2019s personality. In the 11 years he had ruled the nation since the death of his father, the unassuming ophthalmologist had adopted many trappings of reform. With his attractive young wife, the British-\u00adborn Asma, he had put a pleasing, modern face on the Syrian autocracy. Behind the charm offensive, however, little had truly changed; Syria\u2019s secret police were still everywhere, and the \u201cdeep state\u201d \u2014 the country\u2019s permanent ruling class of bureaucrats and military figures \u2014 remained firmly in the hands of the Alawite minority. The Alawites, along with many in Syria\u2019s Christian minority, feared that any compromise with the protesters was to invite a Sunni revolution and, with it, their demise.After offering vague palliatives about future reform, Assad instead used his parliamentary speech to accuse the troublemakers in the streets of aiding the \u201cIsraeli enemy\u201d and to issue a stern warning. \u201cBurying sedition is a national, moral and religious duty, and all those who can contribute to burying it and do not are part of it,\u201d he declared. \u201cThere is no compromise or middle way in this.\u201d In keeping with a tradition begun during his father\u2019s reign, Assad\u2019s speech was repeatedly interrupted by members of Parliament leaping to their feet to shout out their undying love and gratitude to the president.In Majd\u2019s memory, a kind of uneasy quiet fell over Homs after Assad\u2019s address. There were still scattered protests about town, watched over by phalanxes of heavily armed security forces, but it was as if no one was quite sure what to do next \u2014 each side fearful, perhaps, of leading the nation into the kind of open warfare then roiling Libya.Then matters took an even more sinister turn. In this most religiously mixed of Syrian cities, suddenly people began turning up dead for no other discernible reason than their religious affiliation. In early November 2011, according to an unconfirmed account from Reuters, gunmen stopped a bus and murdered nine Alawite passengers. The next day, at a nearby roadblock, Syrian security forces, seemingly in retaliation, led 11 Sunni laborers off to be executed. All the while, a terror campaign of kidnappings and assassinations targeted the city\u2019s professional class, leading many of them to go into hiding or flee.The fighting also had a surreal inconstancy. Some districts saw scorched-\u00adearth battle, even as, in others, shops stayed open and the cafes were full. Throughout, Majd Ibrahim continued his hotel-\u00admanagement courses at Al-\u00adBaath University. His neighborhood, Waer, remained one of the least affected by the violence, and by carefully monitoring the news for reports of specific conflagrations, he was able on most days to navigate the two-mile journey to his campus. By February 2012, however, the combat had become so indiscriminate that the university announced it was temporarily closing. At the same time, rumors began circulating through Homs that the Syrian Army would be returning in force, this time to put down the rebellion once and for all.\u201cThat\u2019s when my parents decided to send me to Damascus,\u201d Majd explained. \u201cWith the university closed and the fighting about to get worse, they felt there was no reason for me to stay \u2014 and it was going to become especially dangerous for young men.\u201d When Majd left for the Syrian capital in early February, he passed a seemingly endless line of army transport trucks, tanks and artillery pieces parked on the shoulder of the highway just outside Homs. The next day, the Syrian Army moved in.LibyaSee Map\u201cIs your father here?\u201d Majdi asked the boy. \u201cWill you take me to your father?\u201dAt the farmhouse, he met the boy\u2019s father, a man in his 30s, who was both astonished and deeply suspicious of this stranger emerging from no man\u2019s land. Majdi repeated his cover story: that he had deserted from the regime and was trying to reach his family. He was helped in this subterfuge by his surname, for everyone in Misurata knew of the Mangoush clan. The man\u2019s wariness eased off, and he offered Majdi a lift into town.As much as he\u2019d heard about the fighting in his hometown, Majdi was unprepared for the reality. Since late February 2011, Misurata had been increasingly under siege by government forces, its residents becoming almost wholly dependent on whatever food and medical supplies could be brought in by sea. All the while, the army had rained down artillery shells, while its soldiers fought the rebels alley by alley, person by person, just as Qaddafi had promised. The siege abated somewhat with the advent of Western alliance airstrikes in late March, but the damage done to the city was staggering. Everywhere Majdi could see buildings blasted by tank shells or scorched by fire, destruction so great that in some places he couldn\u2019t even tell which street or intersection they were passing.The man from the farmhouse dropped Majdi off at his family\u2019s home. \u201cI just came through the front door,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThe first person I saw was my sister. And then there were my sister-\u00adin-\u00adlaw and my brother\u2019s children.\u201d At the memory, Majdi blinked back tears. \u201cIt had been three months. I thought I would never see them again.\u201dMajdi spent the rest of that day in reunion with his family. He learned that after his father became seriously ill, his parents had gone out aboard a medical evacuation ship to Tunisia. He also learned that the list of local \u201ctraitors\u201d to the regime didn\u2019t just consist of old friends but extended to his own family; in fact, for several weeks, his oldest brother, Mohammed, had secreted a group of deserting air force helicopter pilots in his own home. Everyone, it seemed, had joined the revolution and was now committed, after all Misurata had suffered, to see it through to the finish.At some point during this family gathering, Majdi briefly excused himself to go to his old bedroom. There, he took the Thuraya from his pocket and hid it on a shelf behind a bundle of bedding. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what I was going to do yet,\u201d he said. \u201cI just knew that I had to hide that phone.\u201dOver the next week, the returned son of Misurata wandered about his ruined city, meeting up with friends and learning of those who had been wounded or killed in battle. In the process, he came to see that everything he had been told and had believed about the war was a lie. There were no criminals, there were no foreign mercenaries \u2014 at least not among the rebels. There were only people like his own family, desperate to throw off dictatorship.But this realization placed Majdi in a very delicate spot. Ayoub, his intelligence contact, surely knew of his arrival in Misurata and was expecting him to report in. Majdi briefly entertained the idea of simply discarding the Thuraya and going on as if nothing had happened, but then he thought of the repercussions that would befall his family if the regime won out in the end. Or what if the rebels uncovered the regime\u2019s spy cell in the city and his name surfaced?Faced with these possibilities, the air force cadet came up with a far more clever \u2014 and dangerous \u2014 plan. In mid-May, he presented himself to the local rebel military council and revealed all. As Majdi well knew, for a would-be spy to throw himself on the mercy of the enemy in wartime is never a good bet \u2014 the rebels\u2019 most expedient path would be to imprison or execute him \u2014 but against this outcome, he made a bold offer.The next morning, Majdi finally contacted Ayoub, his regime handler, and agreed to meet two days later in a vacant apartment building downtown. At that meeting, a group of rebel commandos burst in with guns drawn and quickly wrestled both men to the ground. Majdi and Ayoub were then placed in different cars for transport to prison. By the time the rebel military council announced that it had captured \u201ctwo regime spies\u201d in Misurata, Majdi was already back at his family home.Although the sting had come off perfectly, there were apt to be other regime operatives aware of Majdi\u2019s assignment, making it risky for him to move about the city. He took advantage of the moment to slip off to Tunisia to visit his parents.For Majdi, then 24, the contrast of Tunisia \u2014 modern, peaceful \u2014 was yet another journey into bewilderment. \u201cIt was so quiet, so relaxed,\u201d he recalled, \u201cthat it took me some time to believe it was real.\u201dMajdi might easily have stayed on in Tunisia; it\u2019s certainly what his parents wanted. But after a few weeks, he grew restless, gnawed by a sense that his role in his country\u2019s war wasn\u2019t complete. \u201cI think part of it was a kind of revenge. I had been with the army, but they had lied and manipulated me. And, of course, the war wasn\u2019t over yet; people were still fighting and dying. I told my parents I had no choice. I had to go home.\u201dBack in Misurata, Majdi immediately became active with a local rebel militia, the Dhi Qar Brigade, for the march on Qaddafi\u2019s redoubt in Tripoli. Before he could be deployed there, however, the government forces in the capital collapsed, and the dictator and his remaining loyalists retreated down the coast to Surt, Qaddafi\u2019s tribal homeland district. There, surrounded and with their backs to the sea, they waged a desperate last stand. For a month, Majdi\u2019s unit held a stretch of the Surt bypass highway, shelling regime strongholds and engaging in the occasional firefight whenever the trapped soldiers tried to break out. As elsewhere in the Libyan war \u2014 as in most wars, frankly \u2014 combat in Surt was an oddly desultory affair, moments of intense action followed by long stretches of tedium, and to Majdi it seemed this rhythm might continue indefinitely.Instead, it ended very suddenly on Oct. 20, 2011. That morning, a fierce firefight erupted in the western part of Surt, punctuated by a series of airstrikes from Western coalition warplanes; from his perch on the bypass road, Majdi saw enormous plumes of fire and dust rising up from the bombs exploding around the city. Around 2 p.m., there came another concentrated flurry of small-arms fire from the western suburbs, one that lasted about 20 minutes, before all fell quiet. Initially, Majdi and his comrades thought it meant that Qaddafi\u2019s men had surrendered, but there soon came even better news: The dictator himself had been captured and killed. \u201cWe all cheered and hugged each other,\u201d Majdi recalled, \u201cbecause we knew it meant the war was over. After all that killing \u2014 and after 42 years of Qaddafi \u2014 a new day had finally come to Libya.\u201dWith the fighting at an end, Majdi returned to Misurata and transferred to a militia unit more suited to his gentle character: an ambulance crew ferrying the more severely war-\u00adwounded from Misurata\u2019s hospitals to the airport for advanced medical treatment abroad. He greatly enjoyed this work, which he felt showed tangible evidence of recovery after so much death and devastation, and it fortified his optimism about the future.Then one December day at the Misurata airport, Majdi received a visitor. He was Sameh al-\u00adDrisi, the older brother of his friend Jalal, and he had traveled the 500 miles from Benghazi to ask a favor. The Libyan revolution had been over for two months, but the last time anyone in the Drisi family had heard from Jalal was in May. That communication was a short phone call from the Tripoli high school where the air force cadets had been sequestered, and it came just days after Majdi left for his spying mission to Misurata.Changing course once again, Majdi set out in search of his lost friend with a tenacity that bordered on obsession. Returning to Tripoli, he spent weeks tracking down some of their former academy classmates and, from them, was able to piece together at least part of the mystery. In May 2011, Jalal had been among a group of some 50 cadets at the Tripoli high school who were assembled and told they were being sent to assist front-line troops as they advanced on the rebels in Misurata, checking for old booby-\u00adtraps and guarding communication and supply lines. Instead, the cadets were used as bait there, sent out over open ground to be shot and shelled at, while the regime\u2019s more seasoned soldiers sat back to observe where the enemy fire was coming from. As one cadet after another fell on this suicide mission, Jalal and two of his comrades managed to reach an outlying farm, where they begged an old farmer to take them south, away from the battlefield; instead, the farmer betrayed the students and delivered them to internal security forces, who in turn delivered them right back to the army. After a round of beatings, the three were sent back to their suicide squad.But that was as far as the tale went. Shortly after, Jalal\u2019s two companions had made a second escape attempt \u2014 this time successfully \u2014 but by then Jalal had been moved to a different part of the front.This set Majdi off on a new search. He finally found another former classmate who completed the story. One day in June, a small group of the cadets \u2014 Jalal and others who had managed to survive that long \u2014 were bivouacked along a farm road on Misurata\u2019s southern outskirts when an officer drove up and called the students over for a situation report. In that same moment, a missile from an unseen Western alliance warplane or drone blew apart the officer\u2019s car, instantly killing him and most of the cadets standing nearby. When the missile struck, Jalal was sitting beneath a tree some 50 yards away, but it was there that an errant piece of shrapnel found him, tearing off the top of his head. His surviving companions buried Jalal\u2019s spilled brain beneath the tree but put his corpse in a truck with the other dead for transport to some unknown cemetery.\u201cOf course I was reminded of the dream he\u2019d had,\u201d Majdi said. \u201cYes, we\u2019d both gone to Misurata to fight, but it was he who died.\u201dFor most people, this might have meant an end to the search, but not Majdi. Recalling the time he had spent with Jalal\u2019s family in Benghazi, the hospitality they had shown him, he was determined to find his friend\u2019s body so that it might be returned to them. After knocking on the doors of countless functionaries in the new revolutionary government, he was finally directed to a Tripoli cemetery where the \u201ctraitors\u201d \u2014 that is, Qaddafi regime loyalists \u2014 had been gathered up and buried.It was a grim, trash-\u00adstrewn stretch of land dotted with hundreds of graves. Majdi methodically passed down each row, but Jalal\u2019s name wasn\u2019t listed. Finally, he came to a far corner of the cemetery where he saw a grave marked \u201cunknown.\u201d Majdi felt a burst of excitement, for it occurred to him that given Jalal\u2019s terrible head wound, identification might have been impossible \u2014 but then he noticed three more graves with the same \u201cunknown\u201d markers. Returning to the cemetery office, he asked for the photographs taken of the unidentified corpses before burial: The faces of all four were so horribly damaged as to be unrecognizable.Still, Majdi was now convinced that one of the four was Jalal. He broke the news to the Drisi family and several months later flew to Benghazi to pay his respects to them in person. \u201cIt was a very emotional meeting,\u201d he said, \u201cand I apologized to them for not being able to watch out for Jalal, but. ...\u201d He drifted off in sadness for a moment, but then abruptly righted himself. \u201cSo that is it. Jalal is in one of those four graves, that is for sure.\u201dSyriaSee MapMajd had kept in regular contact with his parents and friends during his Damascus stay, so he knew that the fighting in Homs had been centered in the Baba Amr neighborhood south of downtown. He\u2019d been told that the damage was extensive, but he wasn\u2019t prepared for the reality. \u201cWe drove past it on the day I got back,\u201d he recalled, \u201cand \u2014 well, it was just gone. Everything was gone. I remember thinking \u2014 trying to find something positive, you know? \u2014 Everyone should come see this. If people saw Baba Amr now, maybe it would be a lesson. They would understand how terrible war is.\u201d The na\u00efvet\u00e9 of that notion soon became obvious; within weeks of Majd\u2019s return, the battle for Homs started up in earnest again. This time, the regime was targeting the insurgents in the Khalidiya neighborhood, and because the army\u2019s main artillery staging ground was next to the Waer district, it meant shells passed directly over the Ibrahims\u2019 apartment building at all hours.\u201cWhen they went overhead,\u201d Majd said, \u201cit was like the air was sucked away. I don\u2019t know how else to describe it, but you felt it in your lungs. It was hard to breathe for maybe a half-\u00adminute afterward, like all the oxygen was gone.\u201dThe fighting in Homs raged on through the summer of 2012, with the Syrian military methodically targeting one rebel-\u00adheld neighborhood after another, their ground-troop assaults backed up by tanks, artillery and helicopter gunships. Throughout, though, the middle-\u00adclass neighborhood of Waer remained an oasis of comparative calm. Majd attributed it to Waer\u2019s diversity; with its mixed population of Sunnis, Alawites and Christians, none of the rebel militias could truly control the enclave \u2014 and if the militias weren\u2019t there in force, the overextended Syrian Army couldn\u2019t be bothered.By the autumn of 2012, that began to change. On the streets of Waer, Majd noticed more and more young men toting weapons, and of those who wore insignia, by far the most common was that of the Free Syrian Army, or F.S.A. The militiamen also took notice of Majd. Of perfect combat age at 20, he found his daily ventures to the university growing ever more stressful as the gunmen demanded to know who he was allied with or taunted him for not \u201cjoining up.\u201dIn response to the growing tension in Waer, the Ibrahims began renting a \u201cshelter home\u201d \u2014 a safety measure that many of the city\u2019s more affluent residents were adopting. By now, so many families had fled Homs that furnished apartments sat empty throughout the city. Contacting one such family that had left for Damascus, Majd\u2019s father arranged to rent their apartment in an outlying neighborhood for use whenever trouble cropped up in Waer. At first, the Ibrahims decamped to their shelter home only occasionally, but by early 2013 their flights had increased in frequency to two or three times a week. Their greatest concern was for the safety of their eldest son at the hands of the militias.\u201cMost of them were just guys from the neighborhood who\u2019d managed to get their hands on some guns,\u201d Majd explained. \u201cI knew a lot of them \u2014 I\u2019d grown up with them \u2014 so that was good. But more and more were coming in from the outside, and those guys were tough. A lot of them were survivors of the battles in Baba Amr and Khalidiya. They were suspicious of everyone, and you just never knew what they were going to do.\u201dAdding another unsettling element to the mix, a lot of the fighters were on drugs, habitually popping an amphetamine called Captagon that could keep them alert for days, counteracted by an anti-\u00adanxiety drug called Zolam to bring them down.Of all the various armed groups that had pitched up in Waer \u2014 and many were little more than neighborhood self-\u00addefense committees \u2014 the Free Syrian Army spurred a particular disdain in Majd. While many in American foreign-\u00adpolicy circles were professing to see secular progressives who, if supported, might lead Syria to democracy, Majd saw only a bunch of opportunists and cowards.\u201cAt least the guys in the Islamist groups had some beliefs and discipline,\u201d he said, \u201cbut most of the F.S.A. in Waer were just young guys who wanted to walk around with guns and scare people. And the funny thing about that is they were the ones who scared very easily. If another group came into their area, they would just turn around and join that group.\u201dLibyaSee Map\u201cAnd we were just students,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s all we were. Both sides used us. Both sides slaughtered us.\u201dDespite all this, Majdi was initially very optimistic about the future in post-\u00adrevolutionary Libya; the country had oil, smart people and, after the 42-year reign of Col. Muammar el-\u00adQaddafi, the will for a better life. In his view, the first great misstep was when the interim government in Tripoli, the Transitional National Council, announced that it would pay stipends to all those who had fought against the Qaddafi regime. Within weeks, the number of \u201crevolutionaries\u201d \u2014 approximately 20,000 by the most generous estimate \u2014 had mushroomed to some 250,000. Worse, the structure of the compensation, acquiesced to by Western governments allied with the transitional council, created an incentive for new armed groups not just to form but to remain independent of any central command, the better to demand their own share of the compensation pie. Already by the close of 2012, Libyan militias \u2014 some composed of true revolutionary veterans, others no more than tribal or criminal gangs \u2014 had begun carving the country into rival fiefs, their ability to do so bankrolled by the very central government that they were undermining. That instability was made painfully clear to the Obama administration when the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi was attacked in September 2012, leading to the deaths of Ambassador J.Christopher Stevens and three others. But for Majdi, final disillusionment took a more personal form. In the autumn of 2012, he received his \u201cdiploma\u201d from the air force academy, announcing that he had successfully completed all the requirements for a degree in communication engineering.\u201cI hadn\u2019t completed anything,\u201d he said. \u201cThere had been no classes for a year and a half, so this paper was absolutely meaningless. But this was the new Libya: Everything was just lies and corruption. And maybe I felt it more because of what I had gone through, all my friends at the academy who had been killed, but I just couldn\u2019t accept that. \u2018Here, take this paper. No one has to know. Call yourself an engineer.\u2019 Maybe others felt it in a different way, or they think of it more in political terms, but it was when I received my diploma that I saw the revolution had been betrayed, that Libya was a failed state.\u201dMajdi faced a stark choice: He could use his sham diploma to land some inconsequential government job, or he could start over. The next year, he enrolled in Misurata University to study engineering. Around the time he started back at school, Majdi also became involved with an environmental group based in Tripoli called Tree Lovers. He was so inspired by its work that he helped start a Misurata branch. While both money and supplies are tight, Majdi and other volunteers have planted flowers and shrubs along many of the city\u2019s dusty median strips and sought to raise awareness about the importance of preserving the very little vegetation Libya possesses. \u201cThe desert is spreading in lots of places in Libya,\u201d he said, \u201cand the only way to stop that is with trees.\u201dBut there may have been a more personal impulse at work on Majdi. One of the more intriguing phenomena observed among ex-\u00adsoldiers most everywhere is a desire for solitude, to be out in nature, and when I visited him in Misurata, Majdi was eager to show me the forest that he and his fellow conservationists tended. On an early morning, we drove out of Misurata for the farm fields and small villages at its southern outskirts.Majdi\u2019s \u201cforest\u201d proved to be little more than a few rows of scraggly pines set beside a farm road, with trash strewn about from careless picnickers, but he was very proud of it. Stepping around the garbage, he strolled among the trees and breathed in deeply of the pine scent with a satisfied smile.EgyptSee Map\u201cSo what to do?\u201d Laila asked rhetorically. \u201cMorsi was completely unacceptable, but now it was him or Shafik, so we were stuck. Well, never Shafik \u2014 that meant a return to the Mubarak era \u2014 so. ...\u201dIn just this way, Laila Soueif, the stalwart feminist and leftist, found herself backing the election of a man who advocated returning Egypt to traditional Islamic values. Many other Egyptians were aghast at the choice given to them; in the June runoff, Morsi barely squeaked in with 51.7 percent of the vote.In his inaugural speech on June 30, Morsi promised that \u201cin the new Egypt, the president will be an employee, a servant to the people.\u201d But a servant to the deep state may have been more accurate. Just days before the new president assumed office, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, or SCAF, the military junta that had ruled Egypt since Mubarak\u2019s overthrow, transferred most presidential powers to the military. That followed a decree by the Supreme Constitutional Court, a holdover from the Mubarak era, that dissolved a sitting Parliament dominated by the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist political parties. On the day he assumed office, then, Morsi was barely more than a figurehead, the public face to a democracy already gutted.Morsi tried mightily to claw back the authority taken from his office. Ignoring the fiat of the Supreme Constitutional Court, he ordered the dissolved Islamist-\u00addominated Parliament reinstated. Even more boldly, he dismissed the senior military leadership, including the powerful defense minister. In his place, Morsi promoted his own man, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the general who had lectured Ahmed Seif during his 2011 detention.But then Morsi overreached \u2014 badly. In October 2012, he tried to expand the powers of the presidency by decree, a move that alarmed both the deep state and the secular opposition, already growing increasingly fearful of creeping Islamization. Morsi swiftly reeled back some of the more controversial planks in his decree, but the damage was done; in a new round of protests across Egypt, the president was denounced for trying to become a new \u201cpharaoh\u201d or \u201cayatollah.\u201dAnd here was the opening the deep state seemed to have been waiting for, the chance to reopen the traditional schism that existed between its Islamist and secular opponents. For decades, the Egyptian generals had held up the Islamists \u2014 and most particularly the Muslim Brotherhood \u2014 as the greatest threat to the modern secular state and naturally positioned themselves as the guardians against them. This strategy had broken down during the heady days of revolution, with Islamists and progressives alike turning against the generals, but Ahmed Seif had seen how easily it could be resurrected. At a meeting of human rights activists organized by Amnesty International the year before, when Egypt was still under the control of the SCAF generals, one attendee after another expressed concern about the possibility of an Islamist electoral victory. As Scott Long, an activist who was at the meeting, recalled on his personal blog, the normally soft-\u00adspoken Ahmed finally slapped his hand against the conference table. \u201cI will not accept that the American government, or Amnesty, or anyone, will tell me that I need to tolerate a military dictatorship in order to avoid a takeover by Islamist people,\u201d he said. \u201cI will not accept such false choices.\u201dNow, with Morsi\u2019s overreach as president, that \u201cfalse choice\u201d was becoming increasingly stark.\u201cIt was very clear what the state was doing,\u201d Laila said. \u201cFirst, block everything that Morsi tries to do, so that nothing gets done. \u2018He\u2019s a failed president.\u2019 But second, feed the fears about him. That was easy to do, because the propaganda against the Muslim Brotherhood \u2014 \u2018They\u2019re terrorists\u2019 \u2014 went back 50 years,\u201d and the propaganda had at least some basis in reality: In the 1990s, factions of the Muslim Brotherhood had formed alliances with actual terrorists groups.By the spring of 2013, Egypt was becoming rapidly polarized between Morsi\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood followers and nearly everyone else. Perversely, many of the same young demonstrators who took to the streets in 2011 to demand democracy were now calling for Morsi\u2019s overthrow. Even more perversely, they looked to the one state institution capable of carrying that out: the Egyptian military.This wasn\u2019t simply a case of national amnesia. One of the more curious aspects of Egyptian society has been a longstanding reverence for its military, a tradition inculcated in Egyptian students from primary school. As a result, even during Mubarak\u2019s era, many Egyptians regarded the military as somehow apart from the venal dictatorship it upheld. Nevermind that the army was, in fact, a major beneficiary of that corrupt system \u2014 the Egyptian military owned construction companies, engineering firms, even a pasta factory \u2014 what a lot of those who took to the streets in anti-\u00adMorsi demonstrations in 2013 recalled was that the army had been instrumental in finally toppling Mubarak two years before. If the guardians of the nation had acted to overthrow one dictator, why not a second one in the making?\u201cYou could see what was about to happen,\u201d Laila said. \u201cYes, Morsi was a disaster, he had to go, but to invite in the military was worse. But so many people I knew, even people who had been in Tahrir, this is what they wanted.\u201dOn June 30, 2013, the first anniversary of Morsi\u2019s inauguration, huge demonstrations took place throughout Egypt, with protesters demanding that he step down. They were met in the streets by counter\u00addemonstrations of Morsi\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood supporters. All but invisible between these two great factions was a small group of protesters advocating a third path. It included Laila Soueif and her daughter, Mona.\u201cWe gathered in one corner near Tahrir,\u201d Mona recalled with a rueful laugh, \u201cand chanted, \u2018Not Morsi, and not the army.\u2019 People going by gave us these confused looks, like we were all crazy, and I\u2019m sure we kind of seemed that way.\u201dIt was at this critical juncture that the defense minister, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, until then regarded as a bland functionary, finally stepped from the shadows. On July 1, the general delivered an ultimatum to the man who had appointed him, giving Morsi 48 hours \u201cto meet the demands of the people\u201d or the army would step in to restore order. Pointing out that he was the elected head of state, the president defiantly dismissed the threat.\u201cMorsi made two great mistakes,\u201d Laila said. \u201cFirst, he thought the army wouldn\u2019t move against him without the approval of the Americans. He didn\u2019t realize the generals didn\u2019t care about the Americans anymore. Second, he trusted Sisi.\u201dTrue to his word, on July 3, Sisi overthrew the Egyptian government. He also annulled the Constitution, arrested Morsi and other Muslim Brotherhood leaders and shut down four television stations. Within days, he announced the formation of an interim \u201ctransitional\u201d government, one composed of military officers and Mubarak-\u00adera apparatchiks, but all Egyptians knew that the real authority now lay with Sisi.It was on the streets of Egypt where the face of the new regime was most nakedly revealed. In the days after Sisi took power, clashes between his supporters and those of the ousted president turned increasingly violent, with the police and the military making very clear whose side they were on. On July 8, security forces fired on Morsi loyalists gathered in central Cairo, killing at least 51. That episode set the stage for far worse. On the afternoon of Aug. 14, security forces moved in to Cairo\u2019s Rabaa Square with orders to disperse the several thousand Morsi holdout supporters who had been camped there during the previous month. By the most reliable estimates, at least 800 and perhaps more than 1,000 protesters were killed in the ensuing massacre. In an obscene parody of the 2011 revolution, hundreds took to Cairo\u2019s streets over the following days to praise the army for its actions.For Laila Soueif, there was to be another, far more personal indication that the new Egyptian regime was different from those that had come before.Laila\u2019s son, Alaa, bore the dubious distinction of having been arrested by all three Egyptian governments that preceded Sisi\u2019s takeover: those of Mubarak, SCAF and Morsi. In 2006, he spent 45 days in jail for joining a demonstration calling for greater judicial independence. During the SCAF administration, he did a two-month stint in detention for \u201cinciting violence.\u201d He fared better under Morsi, if only because the judges, Mubarak-\u00adera holdovers, detested the new president; his March 2013 charge of \u201cinciting aggression\u201d was summarily dismissed, while his conviction for arson resulted in a one-year suspended sentence.Given this track record, it was probably just a matter of time before Alaa was picked up by the new Egyptian regime. That occurred on Nov. 28, 2013, when he was arrested on charges of inciting violence and, in a nice Orwellian touch, protesting an anti-\u00adprotest law enacted just four days earlier. That note of black humor aside, under the rule of Sisi, matters were to play out very differently for Laila\u2019s son from the way they had in the past.Refugees coming from Libya at the border near Ben Gardane, March 2011.Near Ben Gardane, March 2011.Near Ben Gardane, March 2011.Near Ben Gardane, March 2011.Near Ben Gardane, March 2011.On a bus near Ben Gardane, March 2011.Near Ben Gardane, March 2011.SyriaSee MapThat dynamic ended in early May 2013. In a colossal misstep, the Free Syrian Army had recently moved back into the devastated Baba Amr neighborhood, and there had been surrounded and slaughtered. Those who managed to escape the regime\u2019s cordon made for Waer and took near total control of the enclave. Sure enough, Syrian army artillery shells soon began raining down on Majd\u2019s neighborhood. While the scale of shelling was nothing like what befell Baba Amr or Khalidiya, it was enough to keep the Ibrahim family in their fourth-floor apartment, forever trying to guess where safety lay.\u201cYou just never knew what to do,\u201d Majd explained. \u201cIs it better here or in the shelter home? And if it\u2019s safer there, how dangerous is it to try to get there?\u201dAs bizarre as it might seem, one reason the Ibrahims stayed on in Homs despite the ever-\u00adworsening situation was that Majd\u2019s finals were coming up at the university. Their insistence on his finishing was not some homage to the value of higher education; under Syrian law, college students were exempt from conscription, so as long as Majd stayed in school, he was safe from being drafted. Once he took his exams at the end of July, his parents decided, they would reassess the situation and decide what came next.That gamble nearly led to disaster. On the afternoon of July 5, Majd was talking with friends on a Waer street when a white station wagon pulled up and three young F.S.A. fighters with Kalashnikovs jumped out. Grabbing Majd, they dragged him into the car where, blindfolded, he was driven to their nearby base.\u201cI thought it was a joke at the beginning,\u201d Majd said. \u201cBut they knew my name, my age, what I was studying in the university. They wanted me, not anyone else.\u201dFor the next few hours, Majd\u2019s captors insisted that he admit to being a regime spy, meeting protestations of innocence with kicks and punches. Finally, he was forced to his knees, and an F.S.A. man put a large knife to his throat. Another aimed a Kalashnikov at his head.\u201cWell, this is the standard way they execute,\u201d Majd said softly, \u201cso I knew this was about to happen to me. They wanted to kill me very badly.\u201dIn prelude to his execution, however, the chief interrogator thought to look through Majd\u2019s cellphone. With each phone number and photograph he flipped to, he demanded that Majd finally give up the identity of his \u201ccontroller.\u201d The 20-year-old\u2019s continued professions of innocence brought more kicks, more punches. The interrogator came to the stored photograph of one young man in particular and stopped.\u201cWhy do you have this guy\u2019s photo?\u201d he asked.\u201cBecause he\u2019s my best friend,\u201d Majd replied.The F.S.A. commander slowly turned to his captive. \u201cWe will call him.\u201dThe commander left the room, and for a long time Majd remained on his knees, the knife to his throat and the gun to his head. Quite unbeknown to Majd, his best friend was also an acquaintance of the F.S.A. commander, and he came to the base to assure the militiaman that Majd Ibrahim was no regime spy. Majd learned this only when the commander returned to the interrogation room and told him he would be set free.\u201cSo that is what saved my life,\u201d Majd said, \u201cthat photograph.\u201dDuring the drive back to Waer, the F.S.A. commander started a long sales pitch on why Majd should quit the university and take up arms against the regime. Majd said he would think about it.When he arrived at the spot where he had been picked up earlier that day, his parents and friends were waiting for him. The next morning, July 6, the Ibrahim family left for their shelter home, never to return to the Waer neighborhood where Majd had lived his entire life. It was his 21st birthday.JordanSee MapKhulood\u2019s work at KnK had undergone a shift, though. With the war in Iraq having abated, the number of Iraqi refugees in Jordan was drastically reduced from its half-\u00admillion peak. They were soon replaced, however, by new refugees from the war in Syria \u2014 just a trickle at first, but by the end of 2014, their number was more than 600,000.In certain ways, Khulood found the Syrian children quite different from their Iraqi counterparts. \u201cThe Iraqis, because they had become so tired of war, they were very peaceful and easy to work with,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the Syrian children \u2014 the boys \u2014 they have this idea, \u2018We have to go back to Syria to fight.\u2019 They hear this constantly from their fathers \u2014 \u2018You\u2019re going to be a soldier and go back to Syria\u2019 \u2014 so they\u2019re like little rebels, not little kids. It\u2019s all about home, missing home, how they need to go back and avenge what happened.\u201d By contrast, the girls had far more in common. \u201cIn both Iraq and Syria, girls are taught to keep everything inside. They aren\u2019t listened to. This makes it much harder to reach them, so their problems are deeper.\u201dKhulood still hadn\u2019t given up on her quest to get her family out of the region. For several years, she continued to petition for the United States to reopen their case, but those efforts went nowhere. By 2014, she was holding out special hope for Britain; in Jordan, she had worked as an interpreter for a British film company, and with letters of support from her former co-\u00adworkers, Khulood reasoned, the authorities there might look favorably on her. She had recently become aware of a rather diabolical Catch-22, however. Nearly the only way to win asylum in Britain \u2014 or in any other country, for that matter \u2014 was to present the petition in person. To do that, Khulood first needed to obtain a British visa, and to get that, she needed to have legal residency in Jordan. \u201cAnd that\u2019s impossible,\u201d she said. \u201cJordan only gives residency to wealthy refugees who, of course, have no problem resettling in Europe anyway.\u201dStill, in April 2014, Khulood hadn\u2019t completely given up hope. Possessed of a seemingly unconquerable will, over several days of conversation, she seemed determined to put the very best face on her situation, and she was far more interested in talking up her current plans than her past failures. Only once did this brave facade crack, and it came amid a discussion about the future she imagined for the refugee children she worked with.\u201cI stay with this because I want these kids to have a better life than me,\u201d she said, \u201cbut frankly, I think their lives will be wasted just like mine. I try not to think that way, but, really, let\u2019s be candid: This is their future. For me, these past nine years have been wasted. My sisters and I, we have dreams. We are educated, we want to study, to have careers. But in Jordan we cannot legally work, and we cannot leave, so we are just standing in place. That\u2019s all. Now we\u2019re becoming old, we\u2019re all in our 30s, but still we can\u2019t marry or start families, because then we will never get out of here.\u201dKhulood sat back and let out a dispirited sigh. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I try to never pity myself or to blame anyone for this situation, but I really wish the Americans had thought more about what they were doing before they came to Iraq. That\u2019s what started all this. Without that, we would be normal.\u201dBut for Khulood and her sisters, the situation was about to grow even worse. In the autumn of 2014, Khulood said, KnK was having problems with the Jordanian government, which insisted that the organization\u2019s foreign staff members have legal work permits. While KnK said the sisters\u2019 work was exemplary, its efforts to keep them were in vain; that December, all three Zaidi sisters were dismissed from their jobs on the same day.EgyptSee Map\u201cThe idea wasn\u2019t to kill ourselves,\u201d Laila explained, \u201cbut to draw attention to what the Sisi regime was doing. It was the only weapon we had left.\u201d As for its efficacy, she was matter-\u00adof-\u00adfact. \u201cA few people passing signaled that they supported us \u2014 sometimes quite a subtle signal.\u201dAdding another layer of pain to the experience, it came at a time when Laila\u2019s family had, quite literally, disappeared before her eyes.The first sign that the Sisi regime was to take a much dimmer view than its predecessors of dissent to its rule came with Alaa\u2019s arrest in late November 2013. Rather than being released on bail to await trial, he and his 24 co-\u00addefendants were held for the next four months. In a tactic apparently designed to break his will, Alaa\u2019s release on bail in March 2014 was followed by his rearrest three months later.If average Egyptians were alarmed by the deepening repression in their country \u2014 less than a year after Sisi took power, there were already far more political prisoners in Egypt\u2019s jails than there had ever been under Mubarak \u2014 they gave scant evidence of it. In presidential elections that May, Sisi, now officially retired from the military, won with more than 96 percent of the vote. While this surely wasn\u2019t a wholly accurate reflection of his popularity \u2014 between those political parties that had been banned and those that boycotted the election, Sisi faced only token opposition \u2014 even an ardent opponent like Laila Soueif recognized that the former general had widespread support. She had even seen it among many of her friends and university co-\u00adworkers. \u201cThey had this idea that, \u2018O.K., maybe he\u2019s a little rough, but he saved us from the Islamists,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s all they cared about, all they saw.\u201dUp to that point, Laila\u2019s youngest daughter, Sanaa, then 20, had avoided the family tradition of run-ins with the law. On June 21, 2014, that changed. Increasingly infuriated by the treatment of her brother and Egypt\u2019s other political prisoners, Sanaa joined a human rights rally in Cairo. Within minutes, she was arrested on the same charge as her brother: violating the protest law.Even under the tightening Sisi regime, members of the Cairene upper class like Sanaa enjoyed a degree of immunity \u2014 the main enemies of the state, after all, were the working-\u00adclass followers of the Muslim Brotherhood, and they were to be ruthlessly hunted down. But when brought before a magistrate, the college student took a bold step. Despite suggestions from the judge that she stay quiet, Sanaa insisted that she had been a chief organizer of the demonstration and refused to sign her statement until this detail was included. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t going to let them do the usual thing of letting the high-\u00adprofile activists go and pound on the lesser-\u00adknown ones,\u201d Laila said. Sanaa, like her older brother, was held in jail pending trial.For Ahmed Seif, Egypt\u2019s pre-\u00ademinent human rights lawyer, it had meant that his ever-\u00adexpanding roster of clients now included two of his own children. At a news conference the previous January, the former political prisoner took the microphone to eloquently address his imprisoned son, Alaa. \u201cI wanted you to inherit a democratic society that guards your rights, my son, but instead I passed on the prison cell that held me, and now holds you.\u201d By June, that haunting message applied equally to his youngest daughter.Soon, matters took an even grimmer turn for the family of Laila Soueif. Long in frail health, Ahmed had been scheduled for open-\u00adheart surgery at the end of August; on the 16th of that month, he suddenly collapsed and then fell into a coma. Only after intense lobbying by both influential Egyptians and international human rights organizations did the Sisi regime grant Alaa and Sanaa afternoon furloughs to visit their father before he died.\u201cAnd that was the absolute worst day,\u201d Laila said, \u201cmaybe the worst day of my life. Sanaa was being held in a police station, so we had been able to see her and tell her what was going on, but Alaa had no idea. He showed up at the hospital with flowers for Ahmed, so I had to take him aside to say his father was in a coma. He said, \u2018So he won\u2019t even know I\u2019m here then\u2019 and just threw the flowers out.\u201dThe day after that hospital visit, Alaa went on a hunger strike in his cell. Sanaa stopped eating also, on Aug. 28, the day of her father\u2019s funeral. A week later, Laila and Mona announced their partial hunger strike, in which they would take only anti-\u00addehydration liquids.In light of both Ahmed\u2019s death and the family\u2019s prominence, many observers believed that Alaa and Sanaa would be shown leniency by the courts. That belief was misplaced. On Oct. 26, 2014, Sanaa was sentenced to three years in prison for violating the protest law. The next day, Laila and Mona took to the courthouse steps for their intensified hunger strike. Laila braced herself for more bad news when Alaa went to trial the following month, by remembering something her husband had said.\u201cBecause Ahmed had spent so much time in courtrooms and knew what certain things meant,\u201d she said, \u201che was always very accurate in his predictions. Before he died, when he was still representing Alaa, he told me, \u2018Prepare yourself, because they\u2019re going to give him five years.\u2019 \u201dSyriaSee MapWith the serial siege of Homs steadily grinding ever more of the city\u2019s neighborhoods to dust, by early 2014 even the Ibrahim family\u2019s shelter home was no longer safe. That March, the family moved once again, this time to New Akrama, a neighborhood that had been spared the worst of the violence. There, they simply waited along with everyone else for something, anything, to change.That change finally came in May, when the last of Homs\u2019 rebels accepted a brokered cease-fire and safe passage from the city. The three-year siege of Homs was over. What had once been a thriving, cosmopolitan city was now known as Syria\u2019s Stalingrad, with vast expanses of its neighborhoods uninhabitable. It was also only then that the full horror of what some of its residents had been subjected to came to light. In the total-war environment, some residents had starved to death, while others had survived by eating leaves and weeds.But even if a kind of peace had reached the shattered streets of Homs, the war continued elsewhere in Syria, and in a form that boded poorly for all its citizens. Majd Ibrahim heard the names of so many new militias competing with the plethora of already existing ones, it was quite impossible to keep track of them all. For sheer daring and cruelty, however, one group stood out: the Islamic State, or ISIS.An even more radical offshoot of Al Qaeda, the newcomers attracted Islamic extremists from around the world. In Syria, the group announced its presence with a series of sudden, brutal attacks in Aleppo and the desert towns to the east, battling not just the Syrian Army but also those rival militias it deemed \u201capostate.\u201d What most drew the attention of Majd Ibrahim was the group\u2019s reputation for complete mercilessness, for eliminating by the most horrific means possible any who would resist its will.Just a month after the Homs siege ended, most of the rest of the world would hear of ISIS, too, when it stormed out of the Syrian desert to utterly transform the Middle Eastern battlefield yet again.TKIraqSee MapBy the time he was a teenager, Wakaz had joined the legions of other unskilled young Iraqi men who scraped by with day-labor construction jobs: hauling bricks, cutting rebar, mixing cement. When no construction work was to be had, he sometimes helped out in the small candy shop that his father, a retired bank clerk, had opened in Dawr, his home village just outside Tikrit. But it was all a rather meager and dull existence.There was one potential way out. In stark contrast to Wakaz\u2019s own middling ability to find employment, his oldest brother, Mohammed, had been hired as an intelligence officer for the local security forces, and this sinecure held out considerable promise for the entire Hassan family. Given the culture of nepotism that Sad\u00addam Hussein had fostered in Iraq, and which continued to flourish after his demise, Wakaz could reasonably hope that Mohammed might someday work his way far enough up into the munici\u00adpal ranks to bring his three younger brothers, including himself, into the security forces as well. But in June 2014, a series of cataclysmic events were about to break over the Sunni heartland of Iraq, and they would radically alter the fortunes of the 19-year-old day laborer in Dawr.At the very beginning of that year, ISIS insurgents wrested control of the crucial crossroads city of Falluja in Iraq\u2019s Anbar Province, then spread out to seize a number of nearby cities and towns. At the time, Wakaz knew very little about the group, other than that it sought to establish an Islamic caliphate in the Sunni lands of Iraq and Syria. Over subsequent months, however, Wakaz, like most other young Tikriti men, had seen the elaborate recruitment videos that ISIS produced and distributed on social media. The videos depicted warriors, or \u201cknights,\u201d as ISIS called them, clad in smartly turned-out uniforms and black ski masks as they rode triumphantly through towns they had conquered, great black flags flapping from their new Toyota Land Cruisers. Other videos from that time showed a decidedly darker side of ISIS \u2014 executions and crucifixion displays \u2014 but Wakaz claimed never to have seen those. In any event, the budding caliphate seemed far away from the sleepy and economically moribund town of Dawr.By that June, it was far away no more. On June 6, a band of ISIS fighters entered the western suburbs of Mosul, northern Iraq\u2019s largest city, just 140 miles up Highway 1 from Tikrit. Although it\u2019s estimated that a mere 1,500 ISIS fighters participated in the attack on Mosul \u2014 and by some accounts, the number was far lower \u2014 within a couple of days, they had put the tens of thousands of Iraqi Army and security forces in the city of two million to panicked flight. By June 9, the Highway 1 bypass road around Tikrit was the scene of a frantic stampede as thousands of Iraqi soldiers, many having already shed their uniforms, sped for the safety of Baghdad, 100 miles farther south. But ISIS wasn\u2019t done. After Mosul, they quickly advanced on Baiji, the oil-refinery town 40 miles north of Tikrit, and then on June 11 rolled into Tikrit itself.In Tikrit, just as in Mosul and Baiji, the Iraqi Army offered virtually nothing in the way of resistance, with different units seeming only to compete on how quickly they could escape and how much of their weaponry they could leave behind for the enemy. But if the army fled the region, few of the local people did. Those remaining behind included Wakaz and his brother Mohammed.The ISIS offensive of June 2014 marked one of the most stunning military feats in modern history: In less than one week, a lightly armed guerrilla force of, ultimately, perhaps 5,000 fighters scattered a modern and well-equipped army at least 20 times its size, capturing billions of dollars worth of advanced weaponry and military hardware, and now controlled population centers that totaled some five million people. While such a colossal collapse as that experienced by the Iraqi Army must necessarily be a result of many failures \u2014 certainly, incompetence and corruption played major roles \u2014 much of it could be attributed to recent history.Under the eight-year rule of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, Iraq\u2019s Shiite majority had come to dominate most every aspect of the national government, including its military, and to lord their newfound primacy over the Sunnis. For many residents in the Sunni heartland \u2014 and this included Baiji and Tikrit \u2014 this heavy-handed treatment spawned a deep contempt for both the central government and its army, whom they regarded as occupiers. Of course, that Shiite-dominated army was well aware of the locals\u2019 contempt and deeply distrusted them in turn, to such an extent that at the first sign of trouble \u2014 in this case, a few Sunni jihadists riding into town vowing vengeance \u2014 the soldiers, fearing a mass uprising against them, simply bolted.This was not a completely unfounded fear, because ISIS had cleverly established sleeper cells in these cities ahead of time, both to begin attacks when the battle was joined and to recruit new members to the cause. Among those recruits was Wakaz Hassan.According to Wakaz, he joined ISIS on June 10, 2014, just as the guerrilla group became active in the Tikrit area but a full day before its attacks there began in earnest. His chief recruiter, he claimed, was none other than his brother, the 26-year-old American-trained and Iraqi-government-employed intelligence officer Mohammed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t for religion,\u201d Wakaz maintained, \u201cand it wasn\u2019t as if I had any emotional connection to the group \u2014 at that point, I didn\u2019t really know what they were fighting for \u2014 but because Mohammed said we should join.\u201dOmitted from Wakaz\u2019s account was the matter of money. By the summer of 2014, ISIS was so flush with funds from its control of the oil fields of eastern Syria that it could offer even untrained foot soldiers up to $400 a month for enlisting \u2014 vastly more than an unskilled 19-year-old like Wakaz could make from pickup construction jobs. Of course, having now also seized the Baiji oil refinery, ISIS stood to turn its financial spigot into a geyser.As pledging members of ISIS, Mohammed and Wakaz assisted in the seizing of Tikrit on June 11. The brothers also played at least a supporting role in the most horrific atrocity to occur during ISIS\u2019 June blitzkrieg.Just to the north of Tikrit is a large Iraqi military training base still known by its American name: Camp Speicher. Thousands of cadets were undergoing training there when ISIS closed in. As might have been predicted from the conduct of Iraqi soldiers elsewhere, the regular army units and senior military command garrisoned at Speicher simply fled the compound at word of ISIS\u2019 approach, leaving the students stranded. Wakaz said he helped round up the cadets but insists he played no role in what came next.After separating the trainees by sect \u2014 Sunni to one side, Shiite to the other \u2014 ISIS gunmen marched hundreds of the Shiite cadets to various spots around Tikrit to be machine-gunned, the mass murders dutifully videotaped by ISIS cameramen for posting on the internet. Traditionally, armies and guerrilla groups try to deny or minimize their war crimes, but not so with ISIS; when outside observers first estimated that 800 cadets were murdered that day in Tikrit, ISIS spokesmen boasted that they had actually killed many more. (The final death toll remains unknown, but estimates now range as high as 1,700.)After the Camp Speicher massacre, Wakaz signed up with ISIS for a one-year enlistment \u2014 for a terrorist organization, it has a surprisingly formal bureaucracy \u2014 and was ferried up Highway 1 with a large group of fellow recruits to an ISIS compound outside Mosul. There, he learned the rudimentary skills imparted to new soldiers everywhere: running obstacle courses, breaking down and firing various weapons, tactical drills on maintaining squad cohesion on the battlefield. But soon enough his training took a more brutal turn.On a morning in late June, Wakaz was summoned from his barracks by a senior commander. Instructing the 19-year-old to follow, the commander led Wakaz to a field at the edge of the compound. After a few moments, they were joined by two other men, an ISIS fighter and a civilian who appeared to be in his 30s. The civilian was blindfolded, with his hands tied behind his back, and he was crying. The ISIS fighter roughly forced the crying man to his knees, as the commander handed Wakaz a pistol. The former day laborer from Dawr knew precisely what was expected of him.\u201cThey showed me how to do it,\u201d Wakaz said. \u201cYou point the gun downward. Also to not shoot directly at the center of the head, but to go a little bit off to one side.\u201dIn the training-compound field, Wakaz dutifully carried out his first execution. Over the following few weeks, he was summoned to the field five more times, to murder five more blindfolded and handcuffed men. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about them,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I would say they ranged in age from about 35 to maybe 70. After that first one, only one other was crying. With the others, I think maybe they didn\u2019t know what was about to happen.\u201dWakaz related all this \u2014 even physically acted out how a proper killing was done \u2014 with no visible emotion. But then, as if belatedly realizing the coldbloodedness of his account, he gave a small shrug.\u201cI felt bad doing it,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I had no choice. Once we reached Mosul, there was no way to leave \u2014 and with ISIS, if you don\u2019t obey, they kill you too.\u201dKurdistanSee Map\u201cI don\u2019t really remember him that well, because I was only 8 when he died,\u201d Azar said. \u201cMy strongest memory is that there was just a constant parade of pesh merga commanders coming to our house, conferring with my father.\u201dFor nearly 30 years, Heso\u2019s remains were lost somewhere in the mountains of Kurdistan, but a few years ago Azar and his brothers began a monthslong quest to locate them. By talking with villagers and Heso\u2019s surviving companions, they finally found his bones at the bottom of a remote ravine.\u201cWe brought them back to our village, and he was given a hero\u2019s funeral,\u201d Azar said. \u201cEven Barzani was there\u201d \u2014 the K.R.G.\u2019s president, Massoud Barzani.The doctor\u2019s sense of personal loss was more evident when he talked of the death of his brother Ali, the second-oldest of the 14 Mirkhan siblings and the first to follow Heso into the ranks of pesh merga leadership. \u201cWhen Ali was killed, it was a tragedy not just for the family, but all Kurdistan,\u201d Azar said. \u201cHe was a natural leader of men \u2014 charismatic, brilliant \u2014 and, O.K., he was my brother, but I believe we would be in a very different place now if he had stayed alive. Many, many people who knew him have said this to me.\u201dAzar told me these stories on the drive described in the preface, perhaps in part to explain why our destination, a little village in Iraq called Gunde Siba, still haunted him. He was on an indefinite leave of absence from the hospital where he worked in Erbil, the K.R.G. capital, to devote all his energies to confronting the crisis caused by the ISIS invasion. His duties, which appeared to be largely self-determined, consisted of periodically touring the pesh merga front lines and advising its commanders. Everyone in the K.R.G., it seemed, knew the Mirkhan name, and one of its happier consequences was that its bearers could expect to be treated with immediate respect and deference.As we spoke, it became clear that Azar\u2019s self-appointed mission went far beyond confronting the threat of ISIS. He saw in the K.R.G.\u2019s current situation a precious and unprecedented opportunity to create a true Kurdish nation. To achieve that meant not just defeating the ISIS fanatics but ridding the land of the Kurds\u2019 historical enemies, the Arabs, once and for all. \u201cFor fourteen hundred years, they have sworn to destroy us,\u201d he said. \u201cAt what point do we take them at their word?\u201d To Azar, that point had now been reached. In his view, which is by no means a minority one in the K.R.G., the first task at hand is to sever the remaining vestiges of the Iraqi state \u2014 it is a point of pride with Azar that he doesn\u2019t speak Arabic and has only once been to Baghdad \u2014 and then to dismantle the legacy of forced Arab-Kurd integration initiated by Saddam Hussein.Part of the doctor\u2019s severity stems from what he regards as Kurdish complacency in the face of the dangers that lay all around, and it is further fueled by the tragedy he witnessed in Gunde Siba on Aug. 3, 2014.For 22 years after its creation in 1992, the K.R.G. was a relative oasis of stability and peace in the region, its ties to Baghdad ever more theoretical. That exempt status was most nakedly revealed during the American intervention in Iraq, in which the K.R.G. openly sided with the invaders, providing them with back bases and airfields from which to carry out the fight; as local officials are fond of pointing out, not a single coalition soldier was killed in the K.R.G. during the Iraq war. That calm continued through the steady disintegration of Iraq after the American withdrawal, as the K.R.G. became ever more reluctant to pay even lip service to affiliation with Baghdad. To the good citizens of the K.R.G., it increasingly appeared that their mountain enclave had somehow found a way to escape the maelstroms swirling around it, that the days of warrior families like the Mirkhans might go the way of folklore. That fanciful notion ended with ISIS\u2019 lightning advance into central Iraq in June 2014.\u201cI\u2019ve never trusted the Arabs, but as strange as it sounds, I trusted Daesh,\u201d Azar explained, using a common term for ISIS. \u201cIn the past, the Arabs always lied \u2014 \u2018Oh, you Kurds have nothing to fear from us\u2019 \u2014 and then they attacked us. But Daesh was absolutely clear what they were going to do. They wanted to take this part of the world back to the caliphate. They wanted to eliminate everyone who was not their kind \u2014 the Christians and the Kurds and the Shia \u2014 and they were absolutely open about it. After their June offensive, I had no doubt they were coming for us next.\u201d The doctor even pinpointed where they would strike first. \u201cAny fool looking at a map could know. It was going to be the Yazidis. It was going to be Sinjar.\u201dThe Yazidis are a Kurdish religious minority that ISIS had long excoriated as \u201cdevil worshipers\u201d and vowed to exterminate. Their Mount Sinjar heartland was in the far northwestern corner of Iraq and outside official K.R.G. territory, making them especially vulnerable. What\u2019s more \u2014 and this is what a glance at a map made obvious \u2014 with ISIS\u2019 capture of Mosul that June, the land link between the K.R.G. and the Yazidi Kurds in Sinjar was reduced to a single rutted farm road.In the days and weeks after the June offensive, Azar made use of his family name to compel meetings within his circle of civilian and military comrades. At each, he warned of the coming ISIS attack. \u201cNo one took it seriously,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThey all said, \u2018No, their fight is with the Shia in Baghdad, why would they come here?\u2019 \u201dOn Aug. 1, 2014, ISIS guerrillas attacked an isolated pesh merga outpost in the town of Zumar, which lay just 10 miles away from the last road into Sinjar. When still there was no sign of action by the government, in desperation Azar Mirkhan rustled up five or six of his pesh merga friends, and together they raced west.\u201cAnd this is as far as we got,\u201d Azar said. \u201cRight here.\u201dWe were standing on the shoulder of the road in Gunde Siba, just a few miles west of the Tigris River and still some 40 miles from the town of Sinjar. \u201cBy then, it was night, and right here we started meeting the pesh merga who had fled from Sinjar and, behind them, the Yazidi refugees. It was impossible to go on because the road was just jammed, everyone trying to escape. We set up a defense post here and rallied some of the pesh merga to stay with us, but this is as far as we got.\u201d He lit a cigarette and blew smoke into the air. \u201cWe were one day too late.\u201dIn Sinjar that day \u2014 Aug. 3 \u2014 ISIS began carrying out mass executions, a slaughter that would ultimately claim the lives of at least 5,000 Yazidis. They were also rounding up thousands of girls and women to be used as sex slaves. Tens of thousands more Yazidis were frantically scaling the flanks of Mount Sinjar in a bid to escape the killers. Of all this, Azar Mirkhan had only an intimation in the terror-stricken faces and anguished accounts of those survivors streaming into Gunde Siba.But Azar had little time to grasp, let alone address, the tragedy unfolding in Sinjar. Just two days later, ISIS began a second offensive, this one aimed directly at the K.R.G. capital city, Erbil. Turning back from Gunde Siba, the doctor raced south for the battlefield.As it happened, Azar\u2019s older brother Araz, 44, was the deputy commander of pesh merga forces along the very section of the K.R.G. frontier, Sector 6, that bore the brunt of the new ISIS assault. Azar immediately went into battle alongside his brother \u2014 but not just Araz. Most of Azar\u2019s other brothers had long since moved abroad as part of the Kurdish diaspora and had become doctors and engineers in the United States and Europe, but befitting the Mirkhan family\u2019s warrior-caste reputation, many of them set aside their businesses and medical practices to race to the K.R.G. and take up arms. At one point in that summer, five Mirkhan brothers, along with one of Azar\u2019s nephews, were fighting shoulder to shoulder at a Sector 6 firebase.\u201cIt was a good thing ISIS didn\u2019t drop a mortar on us right then,\u201d Azar joked. \u201cOur mother would have been upset.\u201dBut something did happen in the battle that changed Azar. After coming within 15 miles of Erbil, the ISIS advance stalled and was then thrown back by a furious pesh merga counteroffensive. During that counterattack on Aug. 20, an ISIS sniper\u2019s bullet shattered Azar\u2019s right hand. For weeks afterward, there was concern that he might lose the hand altogether, but surgery and physical therapy helped restore some function.\u201cThe important thing is that I can shoot a gun again now,\u201d Azar said, gently curling and uncurling his fingers. \u201cNot as well as before, but almost.\u201dSuspected members of ISIS held by Kurds at a prison in\u00a0Kani Goma, June 2015.Prisoner.

Majd was at work when he received a frantic phone call from his mother: There had just been an explosion at Akrama al-Makhzomeh, the school attended by Majd\u2019s 11-year-old younger brother, Ali, with reports of many casualties.His mother raced to the scene, but Majd was unable to leave work for another 90 minutes. The memory of what he saw when he finally arrived at the school cast the perennially cheerful Majd into a dark corner within himself, his eyes settling into a sad, distant stare.\u201cNever could I have imagined something like that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like a nightmare, the worst nightmare. Blood everywhere, parts of children, and they\u2019re everywhere around you, and you\u2019re walking through all this \u2014 you\u2019re stepping on body parts. ...\u201d He closed his eyes briefly, struggled to control his breathing. \u201cIt\u2019s something I can just never get out of my mind.\u201dIt was only when Majd learned the details of what happened, though, that he grasped the full savagery of the attack. Just as parents and rescuers began swarming into Akrama al-Makhzomeh in response to the first blast, from a car bomb, a suicide bomber tried to enter the school\u2019s main courtyard to kill more. Shut out by an alert guard, the bomber blew himself up at the front gate. When Majd\u2019s mother reached the bomb site, she found Ali hiding with a group of terrified classmates at the back of the school.The double bombing at Akrama al-Makhzomeh killed at least 45, including 41 schoolchildren. It was another reminder \u2014 as if the people of Homs needed one \u2014 that in the new Syria, no haven was truly safe, no place off-limits to the murderers. In its aftermath, the Ibrahim family, like almost everyone else in New Akrama, largely stayed indoors, venturing outside only when necessary.KurdistanSee MapA soldier called out a warning: An ISIS sniper had been spotted in the village an hour earlier, and, in his current stance, Azar made for a very easy target. The doctor gave the man an irritated look, then turned back to his binoculars.The firebase consisted of a series of hastily constructed berms and dugouts on a ridge line about three miles from the Tigris River, with ISIS in control of the lowlands below. In the time he spent here, Azar had survived several ISIS attacks.\u201cFirst, they send in their suicide bombers in armored Humvees. If you don\u2019t destroy them as they come up the hill \u2014 and you need to make a direct hit \u2014 they blast huge holes in the walls, because these are just massive explosions. Then in the confusion of that, they send in their infantry and, behind them, the snipers. It all happens very fast: Everything quiet, and then suddenly they\u2019re everywhere. The important thing is to stay calm, to pick your targets, because if you panic, you\u2019re finished. That\u2019s the problem with the Iraqi Army; they always panic.\u201dPanic didn\u2019t seem to figure prominently in Azar\u2019s range of emotions. \u201cI like fighting Daesh,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re actually quite smart. It\u2019s almost a kind of game.\u201dPerhaps not surprising in a people so implacably committed to establishing a homeland, the Kurds of the K.R.G. find it intolerable that ISIS should maintain dominion over any of their territory. Much as the United States Army will sustain more casualties in order to retrieve their battlefield dead, so the pesh merga have been willing to suffer higher losses to recover Kurdish ground more quickly.At Black Tiger Camp, the back-base command center of Sector 6, Sirwan Barzani, the overall sector commander, could point to the enormous color-coded battlefront map on his office wall and rattle off statistics remarkable in their specificity. \u201cWhen I first arrived here,\u201d he said, \u201cDaesh was just three kilometers down the road. Now we have cleared them for 23 kilometers to the west and 34 kilometers to the south. In my sector, we have retaken 1,100 square kilometers, but we still have about 214 square kilometers to go.\u201dBy May 2015, Barzani said, nearly 120 pesh merga had died in Sector 6, where the greatest ISIS incursions had occurred. At the same time, pesh merga commanders make an interesting distinction between where they are willing to suffer losses to regain land and where they aren\u2019t. For example, the ISIS-held village that Azar studied with his binoculars was inhabited by Arabs, not Kurds.\u201cSo even though it is on K.R.G. territory, it\u2019s not worth losing men for,\u201d he explained. \u201cNot until we\u2019re ready to do a much bigger offensive.\u201dBut when that offensive might come was a matter tied up with international geopolitics, and with the outcome of decisions being made in Washington and Brussels and Baghdad. In light of the woeful conduct of the Iraqi Army in the past \u2014 and absent any will to place significant numbers of Western troops on the ground \u2014 many American and European politicians and foreign-policy advisers were calling for deputizing the one fighting force in the region that had proved its mettle, the pesh merga, to lead the campaign to destroy ISIS. Less clear was whether anyone had seriously discussed this idea with the Kurds.\u201cYou know, the Americans come here, and they want to talk about retaking Mosul,\u201d Sirwan Barzani said. \u201cAre you going to do it with American troops? No. Are you going to do it with the Iraqi Army? No, because they\u2019re useless. So let\u2019s have the Kurds do it. But what do we want with Mosul? It\u2019s not Kurdistan; it\u2019s Iraq, and why should we lose more men for the sake of Iraq?\u201dAnimating that resistance, beyond the traditional Kurdish antipathy for the regime in Baghdad, was what the Iraqi Army collapse in 2014 brought down on the K.R.G. The Iraqis, by abandoning their American-supplied heavy weaponry and vehicles to ISIS \u2014 in most cases, they didn\u2019t even have the presence of mind to destroy it \u2014 had virtually overnight converted the guerrilla force into one of the best-equipped armies in the region, and it was the Kurds who paid the price.By May 2015, the Americans were still trying to cobble together a workable arrangement. The response time for airstrikes against ISIS targets had greatly improved because of the recent deployment of American aerial spotter teams in the K.R.G., but much slower going was the effort to forge some kind of rapprochement between the pesh merga and the Iraqi Army. Directly beside Barzani\u2019s Black Tiger Camp in Gwer was a smaller base where Iraqi soldiers were receiving American training. \u201cI pray for the day I don\u2019t have to see that anymore,\u201d Barzani said, pointing to the Iraqi flag flying from the adjacent base.But Black Tiger Camp revealed something else about the K.R.G., an aspect of the society that most of its officials, whether civilian or military, try to play down or avoid speaking about altogether. For the entire time of its existence \u2014 and indeed, far predating that \u2014 the K.R.G. has been riven into two feuding camps, a schism that led to open civil war in the 1990s. On the surface, it has the trappings of a political duel between its two main parties, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (K.D.P.) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (P.U.K.), but in actuality, it is a contest between two great tribal groupings, the Barzani and the Talabani. The territory\u2019s north is thoroughly dominated by the Barzanis and their tribal allies \u2014 the Mirkhans among them \u2014 virtually all of whom are K.D.P. Southern K.R.G., by contrast, is controlled by the Talabanis and their tribal allies under the P.U.K. label.The feudalistic nature of this arrangement was on display at Black Tiger. All of the pesh merga at the camp, and along the entire 75-mile front of Sector 6, are \u201cBarzanis,\u201d as denoted by their red-and-white tribal scarves. In the Talabani sectors of southern K.R.G., the pesh merga scarves are black and white.Further, Sirwan Barzani is the \u201ccommander\u201d of Sector 6 less through any military acumen on his part \u2014 before the war, he was the extremely wealthy owner of a cellphone-service provider \u2014 than through the fact that he is the nephew of the K.R.G.\u2019s president, Massoud Barzani, who in turn is the son of the legendary Kurdish warlord Mustafa Barzani. This also explains Sirwan\u2019s impolitic frankness with a foreign journalist; as a full-fledged Barzani, he is quite beyond the reach of more temperate but lesser-named K.R.G. politicians to muzzle.This enduring schism has had tragic consequences. In the first days of the ISIS advance into the K.R.G., the pesh merga\u2019s performance was extremely shaky, and as much as they wish to fix blame for that on the collapse of the Iraqi Army, an enormous contributing factor was that there were actually two pesh mergas, with little in the way of coordination between them. ISIS took advantage of that to nearly capture the K.R.G. capital, Erbil, and to start their extermination campaign against the Yazidis.Time and again in the K.R.G., I detected a sense of guilt, even of shame, when conversation turned to the fate of the Yazidis. With no one, though, did I sense it more than with Azar Mirkhan. Part of that may have stemmed from his having tried to aid them at their critical hour, only to discover that the hour had come and gone. But on a philosophical level, he also felt the Kurds had betrayed their history.\u201cYou could say that, in many ways, the Yazidis are the pure Kurds,\u201d he explained. \u201cTheir religion is what all Kurds believed at one time, not all this Shia-Sunni business. Everyone else changed, but they stayed true to the faith.\u201dAlong with his touring of the battlefronts, Azar has spent a great deal of time at the Yazidi displaced-persons camps in northern K.R.G., often working with a Kurdish-Swedish doctor named Nemam Ghafouri. These camps \u2014 some run by small independent charities, some by large international relief organizations \u2014 are home to tens of thousands of the Yazidis who outran the ISIS advance of August 2014, but when I visited in May 2015, they were being joined by a handful of others who had recently either escaped or been ransomed out from ISIS control. Despite having interviewed countless war and atrocity survivors across the world over the years, I found something uniquely horrifying about these returnees\u2019 stories. It took me some time to realize this was because of what was left unsaid, the need to puzzle out the depravity to which they were subjected.ISIS had used rape and sexual slavery as a weapon of war to destroy the fabric of Yazidi society, and now that some of these girls and women were returning, the conservative Yazidi honor code didn\u2019t permit them to speak of what happened to them. In the company of Ghafouri, I met a 10-year-old girl whose extended family had raised $1,500 \u2014 the savings of several lifetimes \u2014 to buy her freedom the week before. She said her ISIS owners had only made her clean and wash their clothes, that they never touched her, and this was a story the family was determined to believe. I met two teenage girls who had escaped from ISIS after one month, along with a relative whom I took to be their mother \u2014 she looked perhaps 45 years old, but a very hard 45: sunken cheeks, missing teeth, graying hair \u2014 who had been held for eight months. Except this woman wasn\u2019t their mother; she was their older sister, and she was only 24. By her account, she had feigned deafness, which is seen by ISIS as a sign of mental illness, and in this way she, too, avoided being molested. As Ghafouri explained, her mission now was to come up with some pretext to see the 10-year-old girl and the 24-year-old woman alone. After winning their trust, she would conduct a physical examination. If they had, in fact, been raped, she would inform their families that they had some sort of infection and needed to be placed in a special hospital \u2014 no visitors \u2014 for a week.\u201cSo then they are taken to Erbil,\u201d she explained. \u201cThey have the reconstruction \u2014 it\u2019s actually a simple operation \u2014 and they come back as virgins. Then they can be accepted back; they can marry someday. Of course it means they can never talk about what happened. They must keep it inside forever. But this is what passes for a happy ending now.\u201dHearing such testimonials has further hardened Azar Mirkhan\u2019s beliefs about what needs to be done if the Kurds are ever to find safety. In his view, ISIS was only the latest in a long line of implacable Arab enemies. \u201cIf this was the first time, then maybe you could say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s this horrible group of terrorists.\u2019 But this has been going on for our entire history. I can promise you that when we retake Sinjar, we will go there and we will find that the Arabs stayed with ISIS,\u201d Azar said. \u201cO.K., some are here in the camps, but many more stayed. So that is why I say our enemy is not just ISIS; it\u2019s all Arabs.\u201dSinjar, Iraq, November 2015.Azar Mirkhan near Sinjar, November 2015.Pesh merga front line, northern Iraq, May 2015.Arbat, a refugee camp near Sulaimaniya, Iraq, June 2015.Arbat, June 2015.A Yazidi refugee camp near Duhok, Iraq, May 2015.Azar Mirkhan (left) at a pesh merga camp near Mosul, Iraq, May 2015.Azar Mirkhan being shown ISIS-held positions in and around Sinjar, May 2015.Azar Mirkhan at a front-line position in Sinjar, May 2015.IraqSee MapPart of his reason may have involved economics; with ISIS\u2019 salad days clearly over, Wakaz\u2019s pay packet often arrived late. But it most likely was rooted even more in self-preservation. Because, slowly but surely, the tide appeared to be turning against ISIS.This was made evident to Wakaz as he contemplated just where he might go to start over. In April, the Iraqi Army, supported by American airstrikes, had recaptured Tikrit, and by that June they were closing ever tighter around Baiji. That still left Mosul and the ISIS-controlled towns in Anbar Province, but life in any of those places for an ex-ISIS fighter was sure to be grim: He would be resented by his former comrades, and a dead man should the Iraqi Army take control.Wakaz finally settled on a very different destination: the Kurdish-controlled Iraqi city of Kirkuk.Just as in Mosul and Baiji and Tikrit, the Iraqi Army garrisoned in Kirkuk broke and fled before the ISIS offensive a year earlier. But there the similarities ended. Racing to fill the void left by the Iraqis, thousands of pesh merga soldiers had poured into Kirkuk just ahead of ISIS and managed to throw back their advance. Ever since, Kirkuk has effectively been under Kurdish control, but the melting-pot city was also teeming with both Sunni and Shiite refugees, making it a natural hide-out for both active and former Islamist fighters. Although Kirkuk was a mere 60 miles from Baiji, the two cities were now separated by the heavily fortified line of the pesh merga army. It meant that, to reach his sanctuary city, Wakaz would have to travel the ISIS \u201cratline.\u201dSyria \u2022 GreeceSee MapJust days after his graduation, Majd\u2019s parents handed their son $3,000 \u2014 all the savings they had left \u2014 and told him to leave the country.\u201cTo them it was no longer about patriotism or defending the country,\u201d he said, \u201cbut about my staying alive.\u201d He gave a faint smile. \u201cPlus, I would have made a terrible soldier.\u201dOn June 21, Majd\u2019s father escorted him to Damascus, where two days later he caught a flight for Turkey. Besides the $3,000, all Majd carried was whatever could fit into his small knapsack.Hoping to stay at least somewhat near home, Majd began looking for work in Turkey. When that proved futile, he saw no choice but to join the migrant trail being negotiated by hundreds of thousands of his countrymen that summer, and so he headed west for Turkey\u2019s Aegean coast, where he might seek passage to Europe. Along the way, he serendipitously met up with an old friend from Homs whom he hadn\u2019t seen in years, Amjad, who was traveling with Ammar, another refugee from Homs. The three became a traveling team. Consequently, they shared the same overcrowded inflatable raft that, on the night of July 27, made the passage from a smuggler\u2019s beach near Bodrum, a Turkish resort town, to Kos, a Greek island several miles away.There, Majd and his two friends endured an agonizing wait. With Kos overwhelmed by tens of thousands of would-be migrants, Greek authorities were taking up to 10 days simply to issue the registry papers that would allow their onward travel. That summer, the migrant route through Eastern Europe was becoming increasingly inhospitable, with several governments threatening to shut it down completely. Finally, Majd and his friends received their papers late on the afternoon of Aug. 4. That left them just enough time to catch the nightly ferry for the Greek mainland, the beginning of their search for refuge somewhere in Europe.TKIraq \u2022 Syria \u2022 TurkeySee MapEver since ISIS gained strength in eastern Syria in early 2014, there have been accusations that their success relied on Turkey\u2019s keeping its border deliberately porous so that Islamist fighters from around the world might pass back and forth. That charge was made most explicitly by the Russian government in late 2015. While the Turkish administration of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vehemently denied the charge, evidence supports the Russian account. Eleven of nearly two dozen captured ISIS fighters that I interviewed for this report claimed to have transited through Turkey at some point during their ISIS service. Nearly all of those 11 told me they encountered Turkish soldiers or police while crossing the Turkish-Syrian frontier and were simply waved through. That was certainly the experience of Wakaz.\u201cThe man who was leading us, he went up to the Turkish checkpoint and talked to the guards for a few minutes,\u201d Wakaz said. \u201cMaybe he gave them some money, I don\u2019t know, but then we just passed on.\u201dAs to whether there was any chance the Turkish border guards didn\u2019t grasp the affiliation of those they were letting through, Wakaz briskly shook his head. \u201cOf course they knew. We were all young guys, and the man taking us across was Daesh. He went across there all the time. They knew.\u201dFrom Turkey, Wakaz made another clandestine crossing into K.R.G. territory, and by the beginning of July 2015, two weeks after he left ISIS, he was in Kirkuk and ready for a fresh start. He was soon joined there by another ISIS retiree, his brother Mohammed.At least initially, it seemed the Hassan brothers had chosen well. In Kirkuk, they moved into a small apartment in a neighborhood favored by other ex-ISIS fighters trying to escape notice, and within a week, both brothers found work on a nearby construction site. At that point, if Wakaz had a dream for the future, it was simply to lie low in Kirkuk, save as much money as possible, return home when the situation permitted and open his own small shop.As modest and heavily conditional as that dream was, it ended on the afternoon of Sept. 7, 2015, when a black car pulled alongside Wakaz on a Kirkuk street. Rolling down his window, the man in the front passenger seat, an undercover policeman, asked the young man with the piercing eyes for his identification card.Refugees off Lesbos Island, September 2015.Refugees landing on Lesbos, September 2015.Refugees waiting to register with the Greek police in Mytilini, the capital city of Lesbos, September 2015.Refugees in Mytilini, September 2015.Refugees in Mytilini, September 2015.Refugees outside the police booth in Mytilini, September 2015.Refugees waiting to register in Mytilini, September 2015.A clash between Syrian and Afghan refugees in Mytilini,\u00a0September 2015.A Syrian collapsing in the heat in Mytilini, September 2015.Refugees in Mytilini, September 2015.Refugees in Mytilini, September 2015.Refugees reaching Lesbos, November 2015.Refugees landing on Lesbos, November 2015.Walking toward Mytilini, November 2015.Walking to Mytilini, November 2015.The body of a migrant, Lesbos, November 2015.Refugees landing at Kos Island, August 2015.A tourist beach on Kos, August 2015.Kos, August 2015.Kos, August 2015.Kos, August 2015.GermanySee MapFrom Greece, the Syrian friends had traveled the migrant trail through Eastern Europe and reached southern Germany by mid-August. Majd had intended to continue on alone to Sweden, where he\u2019d heard winning asylum was easiest, but those plans were dashed when the friends were pulled off a northbound train by the police. After being shunted between migrant holding facilities, they were taken to Dresden in mid-September.For refugees from Homs to find themselves in Dresden held a certain paradox. The city, known for having been largely destroyed by Allied bombing in World War II, was also the center of the growing anti-immigration movement that had spread across Germany over the previous year. Right-wing nationalists were staging mass demonstrations in the city every Monday night. When I visited Majd, it had been just a week since terrorist attacks in Paris killed 130, and anger against migrants \u2014 and especially any from Muslim countries \u2014 was reaching a fever pitch.\u201cThere have been quite a few incidents here just this past week,\u201d Majd told me. \u201cA lot of the guys won\u2019t go to the city center at all right now.\u201dCertainly they wouldn\u2019t be heading downtown that evening, a Monday, when the anti-immigrant speeches in Dresden\u2019s Theaterplatz would kick off promptly at 7.Majd spoke frequently of his intention to return to Syria; an intention that partly explained why he asked for his face not to be shown in his portrait. That afternoon I asked if he could foresee a time when such a return would be possible. He thought for a long time. \u201cMinimum, 10 years from now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a saying in Syria: \u2018Blood brings blood.\u2019 Now everyone will want to take revenge for what has been done to them these past years, so it will just go on and on. Blood brings blood. I don\u2019t think it will end until everyone who has taken up a gun in this war is dead. Even if the killing speeds up, that will still take at least 10 years.\u201dBy coincidence, I was with Majd the following day, when, returning to his communal apartment, he found a letter awaiting him. It was from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees, and it informed Majd that a background check had been completed and that no problems were found; it was the last major hurdle in his petition for residency, making it all but certain that he would now be allowed to stay in Germany for the next three years. Setting the letter aside, Majd crossed to one of the attic\u2019s dormer windows and sat, staring out at the street, for a long time.Jordan \u2022 Greece \u2022 GermanySee MapWith Ali al-Zaidi\u2019s health too precarious to withstand the rigors of a hard journey, it was decided that Sahar would remain with him in Amman while Khulood and Teamim made for Europe. On Dec. 4, they took a flight to Istanbul and from there followed the by-now well-worn migrant trail down the Turkish coast to Izmir. After arranging to pay a smuggler 2,000 euros for spots aboard a boat, the sisters waited. The summons finally came on the night of Dec. 11.They were driven an hour and a half down the coast. Slipping to the shoreline in the darkness, Khulood and Teamim clambered aboard a severely overloaded rubber raft \u2014 Khulood counted at least 30 other passengers, rather than the eight or 10 it was designed to hold \u2014 which then pushed off for the Greek island of Samos, a three-hour journey.The overburdened raft lay so low in the water that twice the outboard motor died when waves broke over it. But the greatest danger came when they nearly reached safety. On the murky sliver-moon night, the pilot misgauged his approach to the Samos beach and smashed the raft against a rock outcropping; instantly, one of the air-filled pontoons began to collapse. Ready to join the other passengers tumbling into the water from the sinking boat \u2014 fortunately, all wore life preservers \u2014 Khulood thought to glance over at Teamim. Her oldest sister sat stock-still, too paralyzed with fear to react.\u201cI yelled at her to jump,\u201d Khulood recalled, \u201cbecause the waves were very high and they were going to smash us against the rocks, but she just couldn\u2019t move. I saw that she was going to die, but I thought, We\u2019ve come too far together, we must now share our fate.\u201dClambering over to her sister, Khulood grabbed Teamim and somehow managed to get them both clear of the sinking vessel and onto the rocks. There they were promptly knocked down by another wave, with Teamim badly hurting her leg in the fall, but at least they were now on land. In the dark, Khulood helped her limping sister up the hillside to join the rest of the migrants as they set out in search of shelter.The following two weeks became a blur of travel and waiting and tension for the two sisters from Iraq, an object lesson in both the callous indifference of officialdom and in the life-altering kindness of strangers. After registering with Greek authorities in Samos, the sisters were allowed to board a ferryboat for the Greek mainland and Athens, where they were sheltered by a friend of a friend. With the situation at the Eastern European frontiers changing constantly \u2014 and not in any way that augured well for the thousands of migrants still streaming north \u2014 the sisters quickly moved on. By Dec. 22, through a combination of bus, train and foot travel, Khulood and Teamim had crossed five European borders to finally reach southern Germany.There, their luck appeared to run out. Arrested shortly after crossing the German frontier, the sisters were held in jail until dark, then sent back into Austria and instructed to make for a refugee holding center in Klagenfurt. That camp was overflowing, however, and they were denied entry. With nowhere else to go, Khulood and Teamim simply huddled together outside the camp\u2019s gates \u2014 and then it began to snow.Their salvation was arranged through social media. After Khulood posted notice of her situation on Facebook, a small international band of activists mobilized in search of someone in the Klagenfurt area who might help the sisters. That aid soon arrived in the form of a local Green member of Parliament, who took Khulood and Teamim to a cafe to eat and warm up. At the cafe, the politician also sent out an urgent message seeking a local family who might temporarily take in the sisters; within an hour, he had received eight offers. From the cafe, the Zaidi sisters were taken to the home of Elisabeth and Erich Edelsbrunner.\u201cToday is the first day we feel comfortable and relaxed,\u201d Khulood emailed a friend in England the following day, Christmas Eve. \u201cThe family is very nice. They have given us our own room. They have a very lovely dog. I love him.\u201dIraqSee MapAfter his arrest, Wakaz quickly confessed to having been an ISIS fighter. He provided details of his service, including the six executions he carried out in Mosul. Whether this confession was coerced through torture was impossible to know \u2014 in conversation with me in the prison, Wakaz insisted that the Asayish interrogators hadn\u2019t mistreated him in any way, but even tortured prisoners tend to say that when their captors are standing over them. Over the course of our two long interviews, the young man sometimes contradicted himself, perhaps a result of trying to gauge what his questioner and captors might want to hear. That said, there seemed a core candor to his words that perhaps was at least partly because of a stricken conscience.\u201cI did bad things,\u201d he told me, \u201cand I need to confess to them before God.\u201dShortly after his arrest, Wakaz also informed on his brother Mohammed. It took Asayish a month to track down the older Hassan sibling, and he was being held in a different prison near Kirkuk. There had been no contact between the brothers since their arrests, but Wakaz hoped Mohammed was also making a clean slate of things. His main goal now, he said, was to atone for his crimes by helping the authorities identify whichever of his former ISIS colleagues were still alive. \u201cIf I had a chance to do it over again,\u201d he said, \u201cI never would have joined Daesh. I saw the evil things they did, and I know now that they aren\u2019t true Muslims.\u201dDespite this professed change of heart, the 21-year-old is cleareyed about his future. \u201cI have no illusions, and I have no hope,\u201d he told me. \u201cI believe I will spend the rest of my life in prison.\u201dBut Wakaz was basing that belief on the fact that he had been captured by K.R.G. investigators and remained in Kurdish custody. In reality, a grimmer future was being planned for Wakaz, one plainly laid out to me by a senior Asayish officer at the secret prison.Since the events of June 2014 \u2014 when the Iraqi Army in Kirkuk melted away before the ISIS assault, and the Kurds rushed unto the breach \u2014 the city has technically been under the joint control of the Iraqis and the Kurds. But this collaboration exists largely on paper. In practice, the Kurdish authorities have little faith in their Iraqi counterparts and see even less reason to cooperate with them on security matters. Nowhere is this separation more evident than on issues relating to ISIS.\u201cThat\u2019s why we haven\u2019t told the Iraqis about the guys in here,\u201d explained the Asayish official. \u201cIf we did, they would demand we hand them over, since most of their crimes were committed on Iraqi territory. Then they would either kill these guys outright or, if some of them are high enough up in the Daesh leadership to arrange a bribe, let them go. We just can\u2019t trust the Iraqis at all.\u201d In light of that, the Asayish plan is to keep Wakaz under wraps and to use him to identify other ISIS fighters they capture and with whom he might have served in the field. Once his usefulness to Asayish comes to an end \u2014 and that may not be until after the retaking of Mosul and the trove of ISIS fighters expected to surrender there \u2014 Wakaz will be handed over to the Iraqi authorities. At that point, his future will be short and preordained.\u201cHe thinks his life will be saved because we have him, and he knows we don\u2019t execute,\u201d the Asayish officer said. \u201cBut Iraq does. The Iraqis will try him in their courts, and they will give him a death sentence. Then they will transfer him to a prison in Iraq to be hanged.\u201dWhen I asked if there was any chance that, because of Wakaz\u2019s assistance in unmasking other ISIS fighters, a judge might show leniency in his case, the Asayish officer quickly shook his head. Or that he could somehow cut a deal to spare his life? The officer pondered briefly, then shook his head even more forcefully.\u201cIf he was senior Daesh, maybe,\u201d he said. \u201cBut he is a nobody and poor. So no. No chance.\u201dEgyptSee MapBy then, Alaa was approaching the one-year mark of a five-year prison sentence, just as his father, now deceased, had predicted. It was a high price for speaking out, and one of the awful paradoxes Alaa faced \u2014 along with thousands of other political prisoners in Egypt today \u2014 was that the old way of appealing to Cairo on human rights issues no longer worked. In the Mubarak era, if enough pressure was brought to bear by the American government and Western activist groups, an Egyptian political prisoner was likely to be quietly released. If General Sisi took away any lesson from Mubarak\u2019s downfall, though, it was to never be viewed as the West\u2019s lap dog. Western pressure applied today has little effect and might even be counterproductive.\u201cBut of course, you also can\u2019t stay quiet about it,\u201d Laila said, \u201cbecause this is exactly what they want. You have to keep trying, even if it seems futile.\u201dThe obduracy of the Sisi regime on human rights has undoubtedly been compounded by a new economic reality. Today, the annual American subsidy to Egypt is less than $1.3 billion, down from more than $2 billion in Mubarak\u2019s heyday. At the same time, Saudi Arabia and other gulf states have subsidized the Egyptian government with an estimated $30 billion since Sisi took power, and given the Saudis\u2019 own record on such matters, they seem unlikely to pester their client state over issues like political prisoners or freedom of expression. The simple fact is that the West in general, and the United States in particular, now has less influence over the Egyptian state than at any time since the early 1970s.Laila derives some perverse hope from the recent economic deterioration of Egypt, a decline so rapid and deep that it might, she believes, finally erode all remaining confidence in the present regime. \u201cSisi still has pools of support,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it\u2019s getting smaller all the time. The situation is really unsustainable now.\u201d But in March 2016, there were scant signs in Cairo or elsewhere in Egypt that any serious dissident movement was in the offing. \u201cNo, it won\u2019t happen today, and it won\u2019t be like Tahrir,\u201d Laila said. \u201cI give it 18 months. In 18 months, either there will be a kind of palace coup \u2014 the generals put Sisi to one side and bring in someone more moderate \u2014 or we will come to a new wave of widespread protest. If that happens, it won\u2019t be like 2011. This time, it will be far more violent.\u201dThe Sisi regime shows few signs of being worried. A second case against Alaa, for criticizing the justice system on his Facebook page, is currently in court. He faces the possibility of another sentence of six months to three years. Even if prosecutors drop that case, Laila will be 64 when her son is released.Mourners after an ISIS bombing, which killed at least 300, in the Karrada district of Baghdad, July 2016.The site of the Karrada district bombing, July 2016.Karrada district, July 2016.Karrada district, July 2016.A Shiite shrine that ISIS attacked, killing nearly 40 people, in Balad, July 2016.Balad, July 2016.Victims of the Balad attack, July 2016.Falluja, shortly after it was recaptured from ISIS, July 2016.The body of an ISIS fighter in Falluja, July 2016.An abandoned ISIS prison in Falluja, July 2016.A mosque that ISIS used as an arms depot, after an American airstrike, in Tikrit, July 2016.Refugees in Tulul al-Baq, July 2016.Refugees in Tulul al-Baq, July 2016.A refugee processing center in Hajjaj, July 2016.Refugees in Hajjaj, July 2016.Refugees in Hajjaj, 2016.Refugees in Tikrit, July 2016.Refugees in Tikrit, July 2016.\u00a0A refugee suffering heatstroke in Hajjaj, July 2016.Hajjaj, July 2016.Refugees, fleeing ISIS-held territory, near Hajjaj, July 2016.A camp for internally displaced people, Baghdad, July 2016.Hajjaj, July 2016.Hajjaj, July 2016.Refugees in Tulul al-Baq, July 2016.Tikrit, July 2016.KurdistanSee Map\u201cThey\u2019re on the high ground? How was that allowed?\u201d Azar stared darkly at the farmhouses for a moment, seething at the Arab encroachment, then slowly turned his gaze to the village center. No residents were visible, but here and there old cars were parked in the shadow of walls.\u201cYou see? Until two weeks ago, Daesh controlled this village, and the people living here had no problem with them, they stayed throughout. We lost four pesh merga here.\u201d Azar turned to me with his lopsided, grim smile. \u201cYou know what I would do? I would go to an Arab and ask to borrow his bulldozer. Then I\u2019d bring in an Israeli adviser \u2014 they\u2019re very good at this sort of thing \u2014 and in two or three days, I would erase this place.\u201dAzar has a flair for the outrageous statement, and I sometimes found it hard to know how serious he really was in such moments. But on that morning, I suspected he was quite sincere. It was Nov. 27, 2015, six months after my first visit with Azar, and we were on a back road to Sinjar, the Yazidi town that ISIS had so thoroughly savaged in the summer of 2014. In the intervening months, Azar had occasionally driven out to the pesh merga front-line trench above Sinjar to try his hand at shooting ISIS fighters \u2014 occupying an opposing trench just 40 yards away \u2014 but the pesh merga, with the help of massive American airstrikes, had recently recaptured the town itself. Azar had participated in the battle, and this return trip put him in a dark mood.His ill temper only deepened when we reached Sinjar. Much of the town, home to perhaps 100,000 before the war, had been reduced to rubble. While still checking for booby-traps, the pesh merga had cleared a narrow path through the ruins, and here and there lay the putrefying remains of a few ISIS fighters. So great was the damage to Sinjar that it was initially difficult to differentiate between what had been destroyed by the marauding ISIS warriors during their occupation and what had been leveled in the battle two weeks earlier, but a pattern emerged. In the small traffic circle at the center of town, ISIS had destroyed the minaret that stood there for more than 800 years. They also razed every Yazidi temple in Sinjar, along with its one Christian church. The hospital in the center of town still stood, but only because ISIS converted it into a sniper\u2019s nest and barracks, knowing that American warplanes wouldn\u2019t bomb it. Even so, they had taken the time to destroy all the medical equipment, even stomping on thermometers and glass ampuls.It was in Sinjar\u2019s residential neighborhoods, however, that ISIS\u2019s policy of ethnic cleansing took on an Old Testament air. On street after street, some houses remained perfectly intact, alongside others reduced to piles of broken masonry and twisted rebar. What most of the surviving houses had in common were spray-painted messages on their exterior walls, each something to the effect of \u201cAn Arab family lives here.\u201d Azar insisted that these were written not by the ISIS invaders but by the families themselves.\u201cThis was their message to Daesh,\u201d he said. \u201c \u2018Spare us, we are with you, we aren\u2019t Kurds.\u2019 And just like in that village, the Arabs stayed here throughout.\u201dThose Arab residents were now gone, having fled when American airstrikes signaled the coming battle. On several of the residential streets, some of the few Yazidis who had returned were picking their way through the Arab homes, loading looted bedding and furniture into pickup trucks.\u201cAnd why not?\u201d Azar said. \u201cThey have lost everything.\u201dIt all became far more visceral and ghastly when two pesh merga fighters led us to a barren field a short distance out of town, near the new front lines. At the far end of the field, pesh merga engineers were cutting a tank trench \u2014 ISIS remained just a few miles to the south \u2014 but farther up, three irregular mounds flanked a seasonal water runoff. From these mounds protruded the telltale evidence of a killing field: human bones and skulls, dirt-encrusted shoes, loops of tied cloth that had been blindfolds. In the rains over the previous 15 months, some of the remains of the mass graves had leached out, so that the dry streambed was littered with women\u2019s clothes, more shoes, teeth. None of the graves had been excavated yet \u2014 the authorities were waiting for a criminal forensics team \u2014 but by best estimates, this had been the execution ground for about 300 Yazidis, most of them women too elderly to be of sex-slave interest to ISIS or children too young to be put to any use.For a half-hour, Azar walked among the graves in silence, but I noticed he was becoming increasingly agitated and then that he was crying. I drew alongside to ask if he was O.K., if he wanted to leave. He abruptly wheeled to point a finger at the steeply rising flank of Mount Sinjar, maybe four miles to the north.\u201cThe pesh merga were right up there,\u201d the doctor said, his voice ragged with rage. \u201cDaesh brought them out here to kill so that we could watch. They thought about it. They did it deliberately, to humiliate us.\u201dReturning to the center of Sinjar, Azar strode briskly into the town hall, one of the few downtown structures still habitable, and motioned for a senior official to follow him out to the terrace. For the next hour, the two men huddled in deep conversation, waving away any pesh merga underlings who thought to approach. Afterward, Azar apologized to me for having taken so long.\u201cI told him that he needed to destroy all the Arab homes here,\u201d he recounted, \u201cbut he was hesitant. He thinks it\u2019s better to give them to the Yazidis who return, but I said, \u2018No; eventually some of those Arabs will come back with their titles and deeds and try to reclaim the houses, so better to just destroy them, leave nothing for them to come back to and start over again.\u2019 He understands that now.\u201dWhen I asked if he thought the official would actually follow through with the plan, Azar nodded. \u201cHe promised me. I made him promise.\u201dThat afternoon, we climbed the hairpin road that led out of town and up Mount Sinjar, the same path that tens of thousands of terrorized Yazidis had taken in their panicked flight of August 2014. All along the shoulders of the road were clumps of the clothes, faded and torn, that they cast aside as they ran.\u201cThere used to be a lot more,\u201d Azar muttered as he looked at the detritus. \u201cIt used to be everywhere.\u201dCresting the mountain, we entered a broad valley plateau that extended for the next 25 miles. Scattered over the land were the tent encampments of thousands of Yazidi families that still had no homes to return to. The historic heart of Yazidi society wasn\u2019t the lowlands these people had so recently fled, but rather the very mountain on which they were now camped, and on the hillsides all around their tent cities were the remnants of their ancestral villages, old abandoned crop terraces and crumbling earthen homes. Some of these settlements had been inhabited for nearly a thousand years, but in the 1970s Saddam Hussein sent his soldiers in to destroy them as part of his anti-Kurd campaign. The mountain Yazidis had then been herded down to the lowlands where they could be more easily watched \u2014 and, of course, more easily slaughtered when ISIS rolled in four decades later.Until a short time ago, Azar might have been derided as a xenophobe, even a fascist, for his radical separatist views. In seeing the results of ISIS\u2019s barbarism, however, and in contemplating the hatreds that have been unleashed across the Middle East in the past few years, some observers have begun to believe that his hard way of thinking might offer the best \u2014 or, more accurately, only \u2014 path out of the morass. The despair over how impossible it seems to reassemble the shattered nations of the region has caused an ever-increasing number of diplomats and generals and statesmen to consider just the sort of ethnic and sectarian separation that Azar advocates, albeit in less brutal form. Coincidentally, the model they most often look to for how it can be done right is the Kurdistan Regional Government.For 25 years, the K.R.G. has existed as a stable quasidemocracy, part of Iraq in name only. Perhaps the answer is to replicate that model for the rest of Iraq, to create a trifurcated nation rather than the currently bifurcated one. Give the Sunnis their own \u201cSunni Regional Government,\u201d with all the accouterments the Kurds already enjoy: a head of state, internal borders, an autonomous military and civil government. Iraq could still exist on paper and a mechanism could be instituted to ensure that oil revenue is equitably divided between the three \u2014 and if it works in Iraq, perhaps this is a future solution for a Balkanized Libya or a disintegrated Syria.Even proponents acknowledge that such separations would not be easy. What to do with the thoroughly \u201cmixed\u201d populations of cities like Baghdad or Aleppo? In Iraq, many tribes are divided into Shia and Sunni subgroups, and in Libya by geographic dispersions going back centuries. Do these people choose to go with tribe or sect or homeland? In fact, parallels in history suggest that such a course would be both wrenching and murderous \u2014 witness the postwar \u201cde-Germanization\u201d policy in Eastern Europe and the 1947 partition of the Indian subcontinent \u2014 but despite the misery and potential body count entailed in getting there, maybe this is the last, best option available to prevent the failed states of the Middle East from devolving into even more brutal slaughter.The problem, though, is that once such subdividing begins, it\u2019s hard to see where it would end. Just beneath the ethnic and religious divisions that the Iraq invasion and the Arab Spring tore open are those of tribe and clan and subclan \u2014 and in this respect, the Kurdistan Regional Government appears not so much a model but a warning.Because of its two feuding tribes, the K.R.G. \u2014 a statelet the size of West Virginia \u2014 now has essentially two of everything: two leaders, two governments, two armies. For the moment this schism has been masked by the threat from ISIS and the desire to present a unified front to the outside world. But it remains an undercurrent to everything. It also goes a long way toward explaining the sad fate of the Yazidis. As Azar pointed out, any fool could see exactly where ISIS was headed in August 2014, but because the Yazidis existed outside the K.R.G. power structure, because they had no traditional alliance with either rival faction, they were left to largely fend for themselves. For all the excuses offered up by K.R.G. politicians and generals, the undeniable fact is that Sinjar simply wouldn\u2019t have happened if its residents had been named Barzani or Talabani.And what happens in the K.R.G. when the current danger subsides? If history is a guide, the Barzani-Talabani schism will worsen and may even lead to another civil war, for part of the hidden history of this place is the series of internecine battles the tribes have waged ever since they first came into contact, a legacy of mutual bloodletting dating back at least half a century and extending to as recently as the mid-1990s. It\u2019s a hidden history that the Mirkhan family knows from personal experience.Over the course of many conversations with the various Mirkhan brothers, I heard a great deal about the exploits and personalities of the two family members who lost their lives as pesh merga and who have now entered the pantheon of Kurdish martyrs: their father, Heso, and their brother, Ali. What I heard little about \u2014 and the brothers\u2019 reticence on this topic became increasingly striking \u2014 were the actual circumstances of their deaths. It was only after repeated prodding that Azar finally divulged what I\u2019d already ascertained independently: rather than by the Kurds\u2019 myriad external enemies, Heso and Ali Mirkhan were actually killed by rival Kurdish pesh merga.\u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace that Kurds should kill each other,\u201d Azar offered when I asked why he\u2019d been so reluctant to share the information. \u201cWith all the other enemies we have, how can we ever turn on each other?\u201dAn excellent question, but it is one likely to be asked again all across a partitioned Middle East, no matter how far down those divisions and subdivisions are made.At about the midpoint on the Sinjar plateau, a bend in the road suddenly revealed an exquisite village on the far side of the river: a series of houses climbing the rocky hillside and, just below them, a number of ancient stone terraces. Some of the terrace walls were more than 20 feet high, the inhabitants determined to carve out any little piece of workable land from the mountain and, built in an age before machines, must have taken years \u2014 decades, perhaps \u2014 to erect. The homes were deserted now, their roofs caved in by Saddam Hussein\u2019s soldiers, but they had left the terraces alone.\u201cIt must have been so beautiful here then,\u201d Azar said, gazing up at the village, \u201ca kind of garden.\u201dBut for Azar, the past was most useful for what it said about the future, and putting Sinjar behind us had set him in a happier, anticipatory mood. As we continued across Sinjar mountain, he drummed his fingers on the steering wheel.\u201cThis is our time now,\u201d he said. \u201cIraq is gone. Syria is gone. Now it is our time.\u201dThat said, I am reminded of something Majd Ibrahim told me: \u201cISIS isn\u2019t just an organization, it\u2019s an idea.\u201d It is also a kind of tribe, of course, and if this incarnation is destroyed, the conditions that created ISIS will remain in the form of a generation of disaffected and futureless young men, like Wakaz Hassan, who find purpose and power and belonging by picking up a gun. In short, nothing gets better anytime soon.On a more philosophical level, this journey has served to remind me again of how terribly delicate is the fabric of civilization, of the vigilance required to protect it and of the slow and painstaking work of mending it once it has been torn. This is hardly an original thought; it is a lesson we were supposed to have learned after Nazi Germany, after Bosnia and Rwanda. Perhaps it is a lesson we need to constantly relearn.Against this, I find solace in the extraordinary power of the individual to bring change, and no person that I met more exemplified this than Khulood al-Zaidi. Through sheer force of will, Khulood \u2014 the youngest daughter of a traditional family in a provincial city in Iraq \u2014 became an unlikely yet remarkable leader and in the process saved what she could of her family. Here, too, though, is a paradox: It is people like Khulood who must see to the mending of these fractured lands. Yet, it is those very people, the best their nations have to offer, who are leaving in search of a better life elsewhere. Today, Austria\u2019s gain is Iraq\u2019s loss.As I write this, the Iraqis are slowly retaking cities from ISIS across the country\u2019s central plains: Ramadi was recaptured in February, Falluja in June. Planning for a joint offensive of Iraqi and Kurdish forces against Mosul is in its advanced stages, and the strike could come as early as October. One who will most certainly play a role in that offensive is Dr. Azar Mirkhan. For Azar, however, the true struggle, of fully separating his Kurdish homeland from the Arab world, will continue in the battle\u2019s aftermath. That aftermath will also mark the end of Wakaz Hassan\u2019s usefulness to his captors; as bluntly explained by the Kurdish security officer, he will then almost surely be handed over to Iraqi authorities for execution.In Libya, Majdi el-Mangoush is continuing his engineering studies, but in contemplating the chaos engulfing his homeland, he has turned to a novel idea: a restoration of the monarchy that Qaddafi overthrew in 1969. \u201cNot that it will solve all our problems,\u201d Majdi told me, \u201cbut at least with the king, we were a nation.\u201d Whatever happens in Libya, he is committed to staying and working for its improvement. \u201cI am ready for a new kind of uncertainty,\u201d he said.In Dresden, Majd Ibrahim has been granted refugee status, which will enable him to remain in Germany for at least the next three years. Now learning German, he hopes to return to college this fall for a master\u2019s degree in hotel management.In Egypt, Laila Soueif\u2019s son, Alaa, is in the second year of his five-year prison sentence. Her daughter, Sanaa, was released in September 2015 under a presidential pardon, after having served 15 months. In May, though, she was found guilty of \u201cinsulting the judiciary\u201d for failing to answer a prosecutor\u2019s request for an interview. Given a six-month sentence, Sanaa is currently being held at a women\u2019s prison in Cairo.In Austria, Khulood and her sister Teamim continue to live with the Edelsbrunner family and were recently awarded scholarships to study intercultural management at a local university beginning in September. Not long ago, their mother, Aziza, who had never left Iraq, and whom Khulood had seen only once since she fled 11 years ago, died in Kut. Khulood\u2019s response to the news was typical of this dauntless young woman. She redoubled her efforts to rescue her remaining family, the father and sister still stranded in Jordan, and bring them to Austria. \u201cTo bring them here, to have a family again,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is my greatest dream.\u201dProduced by Linsey Fields, Danny DeBelius, Meghan Louttit, Jeannie ChoiPhoto editors: Kathy Ryan, Stacey BakerMajdi el-Mangoush, 30.

{"Headline": "Creepy Clown Sightings in South Carolina Cause a Frenzy", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt the edge of dark, dark woods in South Carolina, children have been telling adults that a group of clowns have been trying to lure them into the cluster of trees. They say the clowns live deep in the woods, near a house by a pond.This tale sounds like a mishmash of newspaper clippings and pages ripped from Stephen King novels, but these are actually details taken from a report filed by the sheriff\u2019s office in Greenville County, S.C., last week, after several residents at an apartment complex there said that people in clown makeup had been terrorizing both children and adults.Several children said that clowns were offering them money to follow them into the woods, close to the house by the pond. (The police say they have found no evidence of clown paraphernalia at the house.)A woman walking home late one night said she had seen a \u201clarge-figured\u201d clown waving at her from under a streetlight, the police said. (She waved back.) And another woman said her son had heard clanging chains and a banging noise at his front door. In these cases, people who reported clown sightings refused to give their names to the police.The police don\u2019t know whether the stories are coming from the imaginations of children or something sinister is afoot, but panicked residents seemed to be taking the law into their own hands: The Greenville sheriff\u2019s office investigated reports that residents of the apartment complex may have fired shots in the direction of the wooded area.And the calls to the police continue: On Monday, a child at a different complex phoned the police to report another clown sighting.The pranksters, viral marketers and criminals may be taking advantage of a cultural fear of clowns, with examples including Mr. King\u2019s \u201cIt,\u201d and John Wayne Gacy, a serial killer who dressed as a clown. But Steven Schlozman, a child psychiatrist who teaches a course on the psychology of horror films at Harvard University, suggests that something more primal could be at work.Humans are built to recognize patterns from an early age, and a clown\u2019s exaggerated human features set off a primal warning bell from within our \u201ccrocodile brains,\u201d Dr. Schlozman said in an interview on Tuesday.\u201cIt has this kind of capacity to grab you emotionally before it grabs you cognitively,\u201d Dr. Schlozman said. \u201cThat\u2019s the key to making something viral online actually: to make people emotionally engaged before they\u2019re intellectually engaged.\u201dIn his years researching the things that scare us, Dr. Schlozman has also uncovered another truism: Horror is almost never about the thing that\u2019s scary. The horror unravels once terrified people respond.When the locals take their guns out and fire into the woods, it\u2019s not that different from people going with their pitchforks into the woods after Frankenstein\u2019s monster, he said, adding: \u201cIt never ends well.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018A Generation Is Protesting\u2019 in Ethiopia, Long a U.S. Ally", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "Supported byIs Ethiopia about to crack?\u201cIt was always difficult holding this country together, and moving forward, it will be even harder,\u201d said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa project director for the International Crisis Group, a research organization.Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa, after Nigeria, and its stability is cherished by the West. American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats across the region, especially in Somalia, and few if any countries in Africa receive as much Western aid.But that may be changing.\u201cIf you suffocate people and they don\u2019t have any other options but to protest, it breaks out,\u201d said Seyoum Teshome, a university lecturer in central Ethiopia. \u201cThe whole youth is protesting. A generation is protesting.\u201dAnalysts fear that separatist groups that had been more or less vanquished in recent years, like the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the turbulence and rearm.Several factors explain why bitter feelings, after years of simmering beneath the surface, are exploding now.The first is seemingly innocuous: smartphones.Only in the last couple of years have large numbers of Ethiopians been able to communicate using social media as cheaper smartphones became common and internet service improves. Even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it frequently does, especially during protests, many people are still able to communicate via internet proxies that mask where they are. Several young Ethiopians said this was how they gathered for protests.Second, there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, Ethiopia\u2019s two largest ethnic groups. Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies. For eons, Amharas from Ethiopia\u2019s predominantly Christian highlands flourished in politics and business, exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslim and live in lowland areas.But that is changing as well.\u201cWe are on the way to coordinate under one umbrella,\u201d said Mulatu Gemechu, an Oromo leader.The biggest protests have been in Amhara and Oromo areas. Many Amharas and Oromos feel Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and dominates the military, the intelligence services, commerce and politics.Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia\u2019s prime minister for 17 years, until his death from an undisclosed illness in 2012. He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around corners. Analysts say he was especially adept at detecting early signals of discontent and using emissaries to massage and defang opponents.\u201cThe current regime lacks that ground savvy,\u201d Mr. Abdi, the conflict analyst, said.Ethiopia\u2019s new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was plucked from relative obscurity to fill Mr. Meles\u2019s shoes. Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam is a southerner. Analysts say he does not have the trust of the Tigrayan-controlled security services.The result, many fear, is more bloodshed. The last time Ethiopia experienced such turmoil was in 2005, after thousands protested over what analysts have said appeared to be an election the government bungled and then stole. In the ensuing crackdown, many protesters were killed, though fewer than in recent months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.Development experts have praised Ethiopia\u2019s leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and measurable strides in fighting poverty. But clearly that has not stopped the internal resentment of Ethiopia\u2019s government from intensifying. And it is taking a dangerous ethnic shape.Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amhara town, attacked businesses owned by Tigrayans, and anti-Tigrayan hatred is becoming more common in social media.Analysts say the protests are putting the United States and other Western allies in an awkward position. The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, though it recently said it had closed that base.While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its ally in an already volatile region to crumble.\u201cThat,\u201d Mr. Abdi said, \u201cis a very tight rope to walk.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He prefers to sleep on a rope cot, under the stars, the way they do in the village, and has never owned a pair of shoes that were not sandals. Leaving an interview with the talk show host Barkha Dutt, who is Oprah Winfrey-league famous in India, he turned to the man escorting him and asked, politely, who she was.\u201cA censor is seated inside me now,\u201d he said on Monday, at a book-signing organized by Penguin India. \u201cHe is testing every word that is born within me. His constant caution that a word may be misunderstood so, or it may be interpreted thus, is a real bother. But I\u2019m unable to shake him off.\u201dMr. Murugan\u2019s fictional villages are places full of quiet menace, where caste boundaries are protected with violence and social exclusion.When describing the farming communities of South India, Mr. Murugan is neither sentimental nor harsh; he describes it the way an entomologist might describe an insect.As a Ph.D. student, Mr. Murugan married a woman from a caste of potters, rather than his own higher landowning caste, the Gounders. His mother refused to attend the marriage, softening only when his wife bore her first child and moved to the village for six months. Two decades later, Mr. Murugan\u2019s relatives still remind him, in subtle ways, that his wife will never be accepted.It is notable that Mr. Murugan does not write with the expectation that his work will change anything.\u201cI never had such big hopes,\u201d he said in an interview, glancing down and smiling. Collective punishment, he said, \u201cis part of the narrative. My primary purpose is to explore the experience of the person who undergoes that humiliation.\u201dMr. Murugan barely spoke as a child, which gave him time to observe. His older brother was withdrawn from school after the ninth grade so he could help his father with the soda business, and became addicted to bootleg liquor sold in the same bottles. He killed himself at 42.Mr. Murugan became a writer, with a small but passionate following among Tamil intellectuals. At night he would go to sleep beside his young son at 8 p.m. and then rise at midnight and write for two to three hours during the quietest hours of the night. Many of his colleagues at the government college, where he taught Tamil, were unaware that he wrote fiction, he said on Monday.In clean, clear prose, he had produced five novels in the space of three years \u2013 \u201calmost flawless novels,\u201d said R. Sivapriya, senior editor at the digital publishing house Juggernaut, which commissioned English translations of three of Mr. Murugan\u2019s short stories this year. \u201cHe would train a microscope on one detail and tell that one story, and see the world through that one story,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a certain purity to him that won\u2019t be there now, I think. I think it will be a different writer.\u201dIn December 2014, he returned from a writer\u2019s retreat to his family\u2019s home in Namakkal to discover that he was the target of a well-organized campaign. Strangers called repeatedly to accuse him of slandering the Gounder caste in \u201cOne Part Woman,\u201d which had been released in an English translation, and he tried earnestly to explain his motivation. The aggression built, culminating in a book burning and a citywide strike.Mr. Murugan retuned to his home under police escort and posted a message on Facebook: \u201cPerumal Murugan the writer is dead. As he is not god, he is not going to resurrect himself. He also has no faith in rebirth. An ordinary teacher, he will live as P. Murugan. Leave him alone.\u201dOn Monday here in New Delhi, Mr. Murugan described a deep depression that followed, during which he neither read nor wrote. It ended, he said, in 2015, when he found himself at a friend\u2019s house, locked in a room stacked with books.\u201cWith nothing to do I lay dazed night and day,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as I ruminated over my existence, there came a certain instant when the sluice gates were breached. I began to write. I chronicled the moment when I felt like a rat, dazzled by the light, burrowing itself into its hole.\u201d The result was a book of poetry that went on sale on Monday, titled \u201cKozhayin Paadalkal,\u201d or \u201cSongs of a Coward.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Intel\u2019s New Mission: Find Fresh Uses for Its Famous Paranoia", "Date": "2016-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsThat sounds cool, if you like your capitalism fierce. That idea, however, turns out to have some significant downsides.Intel is the world\u2019s biggest semiconductor company because when Mr. Grove was in charge, it dominated the personal computer industry and was an important player in the associated business in computer servers.Today, the PC market is shrinking, hurting Intel\u2019s profits. The server-chip industry is still strong, thanks to the rise of cloud computing at companies like Facebook and Google. Cloud companies engineer server chips in ways that make very powerful and flexible systems used by millions of people.But Intel missed joining a number of other markets that did not look like the PC business, particularly smartphones. It is scrambling for a place in sensors (or what is called the internet of things), wireless networking, autonomous vehicles and other hot areas, as computing spreads from traditional computers to nearly every machine.\u201cThe mistake was, when you grow with great leadership and great success, your paranoia is focused on the one thing that is delivering that,\u201d Brian Krzanich, Intel\u2019s current chief executive, said in an interview.From PC-dominated computing, he said, we are now \u201cwhere computing is constantly shifting.\u201d Mr. Krzanich says he is still a strong believer in paranoia, but he must turn that vigilant anxiety in a lot of directions at once. Cloud computing may be Intel\u2019s core, but Mr. Krzanich has to feed it from chips in many markets.The effect of those changes will be seen this week as Intel holds its Developer Forum in San Francisco. The conference is where the hard-core geeks of computing gather to hear about what\u2019s coming in the realms of processing power, memory and other technology that enables the modern world.Giant tech trade shows like the International CES, held in Las Vegas every January, are focused on hot products. Developer events may be nerd-fests, but they say more about the technology world, and where a company hopes to be in two or three years.Shifting gears for the giant chip company is no easy task. \u201cIntel has four main business lines \u2014 PCs, mobile, internet of things and servers \u2014 and it\u2019s hitting on one of them,\u201d said Patrick Gelsinger, a longtime Intel executive who is now chief executive of the software company VMware. The factories where Intel builds chips \u201cnow cost $10 billion, at least,\u201d each to set up, he said, \u201cand the competition is catching up.\u201dIn April, Intel announced it was cutting its work force by 12,000 people, about 11 percent of workers. About a quarter of the executives who report to Mr. Krzanich come from other companies, a big deal at a place where leaders rise through the ranks over decades.In his speech, Mr. Krzanich may stay away from talking about wearable devices. Last month, Intel withdrew a health-monitoring watch that had some nice capabilities but sometimes burned its wearers\u2019 skin. Even so, Mr. Krzanich said, the heart-monitoring capabilities of that watch will find their way into a device Intel plans to make with the athletics brand New Balance.The part he is looking forward to, Mr. Krzanich said, is a one-hour question-and-answer session with 200 elite developers. \u201cIt\u2019s a much broader group\u201d than even a couple of years ago, he said. \u201cPeople writing for machine learning and A.I., networking chips, how virtual reality feeds into PCs.\u201d Even in decline, PC chips still make up half of Intel\u2019s revenue.If these things catch on, Intel will sell more chips to those businesses and create new demand for cloud computing, because most devices are now connected to the cloud.Even so, another pillar of the Intel mythology, the unchanging nature of Moore\u2019s Law, is getting revised. Named for the Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, it states that a chip\u2019s power doubles every 18 to 24 months without a rise in costs. Mr. Grove\u2019s paranoia championed and fed on Moore\u2019s Law, as Intel strove to achieve profit from that computing cadence.Silicon Valley treats Moore\u2019s Law as if it is immutable, and with even more reverence than it does paranoia. But it was not a scientific law; it was always an observation about the behavior of a market for computers and software, which paid off at a rate to justify increasing investment in making chips.That is why Intel is in the wireless and networking fields, and is working on a new kind of three-dimensional memory chip, which Mr. Krzanich said would be out at the end of this year, that can speed performance of big-data-type calculations sevenfold.There would be a historical precedent to that shift. Years ago, Intel\u2019s main business was in memory chips, a market that collapsed three decades ago, leading the company to move toward making number-crunching processors for PCs. That shift, which arguably saved the company, was the lesson that led to Mr. Grove\u2019s paranoia.Advertisement"}
