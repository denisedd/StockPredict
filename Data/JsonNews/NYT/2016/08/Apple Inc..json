{"Headline": "Uber Speeds Toward a Driverless Future, Putting Jobs in Danger", "Date": "2016-08-18", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsTravis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s chief executive, has made no secret of wanting to replace its chauffeurs with cars that can ferry passengers without driver input. Uber is not alone. From old-school car and truck manufacturers and parts makers to Silicon Valley interlopers like Tesla, Apple and Alphabet, dozens of companies are racing to develop driverless technology.Along with saving valuable time, fully autonomous vehicles could reduce traffic accidents by 90 percent or more, the Boston Consulting Group has estimated. That would avoid hundreds of billions of dollars in injuries, vehicle damage and lost productivity caused by traffic accidents, which kill more than 30,000 Americans each year.There is a big downside, though. Heavy trucking employs nearly two million people across the United States, with a median salary of over $40,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That is about double what hundreds of thousands of others employed as taxi and limousine drivers make. Both industries are now firmly in Uber\u2019s cross hairs.The jobs might not disappear completely, of course. Moreover, shifting from today\u2019s limited autonomy features like automatic braking and lane correction to truly self-driving vehicles across the country is a huge technology challenge that could take years and draw serious political resistance. Even in a fully autonomous world, freight haulers and livery services would still need mechanics and tech specialists to keep fleets rolling.Still, the threat is clear. And America\u2019s threadbare social safety net and worker-retraining programs may struggle to support a mass retooling of skills. That would heap further pressure on working-class communities already reeling from the loss of more than five million manufacturing jobs over the last two decades.Uber\u2019s new partnerships are the latest sign that the push to driverless is accelerating. Policy makers and politicians should consider themselves forewarned.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Every Company Is a Tech Company, Does the Label Matter?", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesApple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon have created something of a watershed moment in the stock market.They became the four most valuable companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index at the close of trading on Aug. 1, according to S.&P.\u2019s official tally. That meant that tech companies, by one common definition, occupied the four top spots in the market capitalization rankings, a rare and brief occurrence.\u201cIt may never have happened before at the close of trading,\u201d said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. The full history of daily rankings isn\u2019t readily available, however, so we can\u2019t be certain, and such rankings are evanescent, shifting with every tick of the stock market. In fact, on Friday, Amazon dropped back into sixth place.But no matter: The early August rankings were a reminder of how far tech has come. It is a dominant force in the stock market and the economy, one so all-encompassing that tech may no longer even be a useful concept for understanding today\u2019s stock market.One of them is Exxon Mobil, the energy giant and the most valuable company in the S.&P. as recently as 2012. But Exxon Mobil has been cut down in size by the oil price debacle. The other is Berkshire Hathaway, Warren E. Buffett\u2019s conglomerate, which the S.&P. categorizes as a financial services company \u2014 the only such company left in the Top 10 market cap list. Berkshire announced its own earnings after trading closed on Friday. We\u2019ll soon learn whether the market is pleased enough to vault Berkshire further ahead of Amazon.The three tech companies at the very top in market cap \u2014 Apple, Google and Microsoft \u2014 have held high positions for a long while. (Google, ranked second, trades as Alphabet, the name of its parent company.) Google passed Apple in value briefly this year, but Apple regained the top perch, which it has held since 2012. Microsoft, now No. 3, was the most valuable company during the last tech boom, in the early 2000s.Virtually no one disputes S.&P.\u2019s formal classification of Apple, Google and Microsoft as \u201cinformation technology\u201d companies. The same is true of Facebook, which held seventh place in the latest list of most valuable companies. But while Amazon is often described as a tech company \u2014 and undoubtedly uses and creates innovative technology \u2014 S.&P. has never classified it as one.In fact, Amazon is formally known as a \u201cconsumer discretionary company,\u201d like Walmart, which it has displaced as a member of the Top 10 most valuable companies. Amazon is the only consumer discretionary company left in the Top 10. Is it in some sense a tech company? Certainly, and we\u2019ll get back to that.But the same can be said, to one degree or another, about the three other members of the Top 10 \u2014 old companies that are still prospering in large part because of their mastery of advanced technologies. Johnson & Johnson, for example, which is ranked eighth, is a health care company, yet it is heavily involved in technology of a biological kind. Then there is General Electric, the diversified industrial company (and, until recently, also a financial services company), once described as a bellwether for the entire market. It conducts advanced research and sells tech products.Last on the list is AT&T, a telecommunications company, which, in an early form, helped create computer languages and operating systems on which modern tech companies are built. In 1957, when the S.&P. 500 was born, an ancestral version of AT&T was the most valuable company in the United States by a very wide margin, said Jeremy J. Siegel, a Wharton business school professor, the author of \u201cStocks for the Long Run\u201d and a market historian.\u201cAT&T back then was a highly regulated old phone company,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a giant, later broken up into smaller companies. And it was an outlier, because the other big companies in the S.&P. 500 in that era were mainly materials companies \u2014 like United States Steel, DuPont and Union Carbide \u2014 and an awful lot of oil companies.\u201dIn 1957, the economy ran on oil, and the biggest energy company was Standard Oil of New Jersey \u2014 an ancestor of Exxon Mobil. No pure tech company ranked in the Top 10 back then, not even IBM, which soon became the dominant tech company, a position it held until Microsoft surpassed it in the mid-1990s. That was the decade of the great tech boom, culminating in the bubble that burst in March 2000. Microsoft was No. 1 in market cap at the end of 1999, and four other tech companies \u2014 Cisco Systems, Intel, IBM and America Online \u2014 were also among the Top 10 most valuable companies. The stock market celebrated tech\u2019s ascendance then, as it does now.But this is a different era. When you dig deeper into the S.&P. 500, it\u2019s clear that while the valuations of tech companies swelled to unrealistically high proportions in those bubble years, the valuations of most companies are far more modest now. In March 2000, the height of the bubble, the value of information technology companies swelled to 34.5 percent of the total market cap of the S.&P. 500. At the moment, the comparable figure is only 20.7 percent, data from the Bespoke Investment Group shows. That\u2019s not much more than the 15.7 percent share of financial companies or the 15.2 percent share of the health care sector. By contrast, finance ballooned as high as 22.3 percent at the end of 2006, in what can be seen in hindsight as a financial bubble.On the other hand, materials and energy companies, which together constituted almost half of the total value of the S.&P. 500 in 1957, now account for less than 10 percent of it. That reflects the collapse of energy and commodity prices over the last few years, and it may well be a temporary phenomenon. In the meantime, diversified energy companies like Exxon Mobil are investing heavily in technology, a necessity if they are to flourish.It\u2019s clear even to energy companies, in other words, that tech\u2019s abiding power in the marketplace is not temporary. Technology permeates every sector of the economy, even those not formally classified as high-tech. Whether companies like Amazon and Johnson & Johnson should carry tech labels is beside the point. Tech has already taken over.These days every company is a tech company, but some have better niches, faster growth, more attractive offerings or more favorable share prices than others. These kinds of fundamental distinctions will influence the Top 10 rankings of the future.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Swiping a Screen Rather Than Flip a Page in Baseball", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf a major league coach or player is scrolling through an iPad in the dugout, he is probably not perusing Facebook but rather accessing his scouting reports.Through a partnership with Apple, each team in Major League Baseball has been given eight iPads to use in the dugout and bullpen during games. They are loaded with M.L.B. Dugout, an app that displays scouting reports and other information as well as videos of their opponents.\u201cI think we wanted to kind of make sure that we were able to continue to support and allow our clubs to stay on the cutting edge in terms of technology, and analytics and using statistics to help the sport be a better sport,\u201d said Chris Marinak, M.L.B.\u2019s senior vice president for league economics and strategy.For the most part, the iPads offer information that teams already use, but in a way that is faster and easier to access.The San Francisco Giants have embraced the iPads, and the Giants\u2019 bench coach, Ron Wotus, said that he had eliminated the binders he previously used.\u201cWe\u2019ve always had it in books,\u201d Wotus said. \u201cI\u2019d have to carry two big binders, and you have to flip through papers. So it\u2019s much more efficient.\u201dWotus said he checked the iPad more often during the first games of series against teams outside the Giants\u2019 division.\u201cYou can prepare all day, and you get in the game, we don\u2019t know these clubs as well,\u201d Wotus said. \u201cThere\u2019s always something else that you can look at. So it\u2019s available if I want it, but I would say I\u2019m looking at that more than I was the binders.\u201dTeams were able to test the program at the end of last season. Then, after some enhancements to the app, it became standard at the start of this season. An updated version was released after the All-Star break, allowing coaches to make handwritten notes and look at files side by side.The iPads are different from the ones consumers use. Dugout is the only app clubs can access. Even the camera is disabled.Sean True, the senior director for club services and baseball technology at the commissioner\u2019s office, said the clubs\u2019 top concern was data protection and security.Support staff members load the information that the Giants\u2019 coaches want. For Wotus, that includes scouting reports and spray charts, because he also manages the infield defense. He also uses the video of an opposing player.\u201cYou can look at plots on paper, like a spray chart, and that doesn\u2019t tell you the story,\u201d Wotus said.The Giants\u2019 hitting coach, Hensley Meulens, has players study opposing pitchers in the video room on the first day of a series. But then, when a reliever comes into the game, he will pull up his report on an iPad to provide a refresher.He also keeps a simple sheet of paper on a clipboard with information on the opposing team\u2019s pitchers. A few Giants players look at the paper, but most use an iPad, Meulens said.\u201cIt\u2019s a lot quicker to get to the player you want to get to, because you just click on him and it opens up,\u201d Meulens said. \u201cOtherwise, you have to try to find the guy as time is running.\u201dFor Mets Manager Terry Collins, turning a page is still quicker, although he also said the iPads were useful.\u201cI know people that are a lot more familiar using them are glad they\u2019re in there,\u201d he said.Meulens said he still kept a binder for backup in case of an iPad malfunction. And when several players are trying to look up information at the same time, it can be helpful to have three options: the iPad, the binder and the cheat sheet on the clipboard.The St. Louis Cardinals are one club that has not quite fully adopted the iPads. Cardinals reliever Matt Bowman said much of the team\u2019s bullpen information was relayed orally. And if he has a question, he will refer back to the bullpen coach, Blaise Ilsley.\u201cSo he\u2019s sort of our iPad in that sense,\u201d Bowman said.Baltimore Orioles Manager Buck Showalter said he would check an iPad in the dugout occasionally, sometimes when a new pitcher entered the game. But perhaps memory, at least Showalter\u2019s, is one thing the iPads can\u2019t trump.\u201cIf you\u2019re referring to that a lot when you\u2019re out here, you haven\u2019t done your homework,\u201d Showalter said. \u201cI usually have it, believe it or not, stored upstairs.\u201d James Wagner contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cloud Computing Brings Sprawling Centers, but Few Jobs, to Small Towns", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBoydton JournalBOYDTON, Va. \u2014 A giant Microsoft facility just outside this very small town hides behind a quarter-mile berm and a guard house, across the highway from the rubble of a demolished prison.Behind the berm, six unmarked hangars each hold tens of thousands of computer servers. Microsoft has cleared enough scrub trees and vines for at least 15 of these buildings, and six more are already under construction.One thing there isn\u2019t much of at this Microsoft complex, one single computer data center, is long-term work. Microsoft says it might have \u201cseveral dozen\u201d employees in a place like this. They are mostly elite computer workers who tend not to come from Boydton, which lost a lot of good jobs when nearby factories closed and the prison shut down.So it is in a number of small towns across the country, as technology giants like Amazon, Google and Microsoft race to build networks of unprecedented size to provide services over the internet, a technology trend known as cloud computing. Local people, along with many economists and officials, often think these data centers are a key to an industrial revival. But the reality is less impressive.\u201cI\u2019ve worked on a lot of nuclear power plants, and these things are a lot bigger than that,\u201d said E. W. Gregory, the head of the local electrical workers\u2019 union. But \u201cthe first thing they put in was a guard shack and a fence. I\u2019ve filled rooms with people looking for entry-level work. None of it lasts.\u201dThe companies come to places like Boydton for basics like land, water and electricity. Even with low local wages, people are a high-cost item. As small as the staffs at these mammoth facilities are, companies say, perhaps a third of the company jobs will eventually be filled by robots.Google started building in eastern Oregon to be near cheap hydroelectric power on the Columbia River, and most recently it has focused on Iowa, Alabama and Tennessee. Microsoft has a center in Wyoming, and it bought a nine-hole golf course as part of a complex near West Des Moines, Iowa. Amazon recently built similar giant facilities on the outer reaches of Columbus, Ohio, and Dulles, Va.\u201cA lot of this stuff is put in rural parts of the country that used to be part of a manufacturing economy\u201d that has gone overseas, said Bill Coughran, a partner at the venture investment firm Sequoia Capital who ran much of Google\u2019s big engineering for eight years. \u201cTextiles and furniture created a big power grid in the south. Then those jobs went away.\u201dThat\u2019s been the story for Boydton, population 430, in the middle of tobacco country a few miles from the North Carolina border. The prison across from the Microsoft center closed in 2012. A nearby Burlington Industries textile plant that employed more than 2,000 shut in 2002. It was razed in 2012.The South Virginia tobacco economy collapsed as Americans cut back on smoking. But in 1999, Virginia used some of the $4.1 billion it received in a settlement with cigarette makers to build high-speed fiber-optic lines throughout the region.The broadband drew Microsoft, along with some financial perks. Mecklenburg County, which received $2.1 million from the state for the project, has given Microsoft 350 acres and offset personal property taxes by 82.5 percent, according to Wayne Carter, the county administrator.Initially, Apple, which is building a big cloud center for consumers\u2019 photos and music, wanted the Boydton site, but it went across the border to North Carolina, which promised tax breaks on its data center equipment. Not to be outdone, Virginia passed laws in 2009 and 2010 that exempted sales taxes on things like data center computer servers, software, power generators and chillers to cool all that equipment.\u201cWe\u2019ve had six years of construction work,\u201d said Mr. Carter. That has helped the county, he said, because even temporary workers rent houses, stay in hotels and eat in local restaurants.Microsoft did not dispute reports that it would spend $1.1 billion on the Boydton data center, and said that \u201con average, data centers employ tens to several dozen people,\u201d in a mixture of corporate and contracted positions. It declined to let a reporter tour the site.\u201cThey talked about 100 jobs, but it\u2019s a slow process,\u201d said Thomas C. Coleman III, the mayor of Boydton. So far, he says, the biggest impact \u201chas been a couple of lunch tables at the Triangle gas station.\u201dHe understates matters, but not by much. Mr. Gregory, the electrician, said his union had hundreds of applicants for work digging ditches and laying pipe, starting at $10.88 an hour. Wiring paid $28.59. Both jobs tended to last about six months, he said, with lots of attrition for the hard outdoor labor.Working as a security guard or as someone testing the wires inside the data center offers better money, but there are not many positions. Microsoft prefers to fly in its own specialists for some work, and it doesn\u2019t like hiring people who have worked in other big companies\u2019 cloud-computing centers, Mr. Gregory said.

{"Headline": "Swiping a Screen Rather Than Flip a Page in Baseball", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "Supported byIf a major league coach or player is scrolling through an iPad in the dugout, he is probably not perusing Facebook but rather accessing his scouting reports.Through a partnership with Apple, each team in Major League Baseball has been given eight iPads to use in the dugout and bullpen during games. They are loaded with M.L.B. Dugout, an app that displays scouting reports and other information as well as videos of their opponents.\u201cI think we wanted to kind of make sure that we were able to continue to support and allow our clubs to stay on the cutting edge in terms of technology, and analytics and using statistics to help the sport be a better sport,\u201d said Chris Marinak, M.L.B.\u2019s senior vice president for league economics and strategy.For the most part, the iPads offer information that teams already use, but in a way that is faster and easier to access.The San Francisco Giants have embraced the iPads, and the Giants\u2019 bench coach, Ron Wotus, said that he had eliminated the binders he previously used.\u201cWe\u2019ve always had it in books,\u201d Wotus said. \u201cI\u2019d have to carry two big binders, and you have to flip through papers. So it\u2019s much more efficient.\u201dWotus said he checked the iPad more often during the first games of series against teams outside the Giants\u2019 division.\u201cYou can prepare all day, and you get in the game, we don\u2019t know these clubs as well,\u201d Wotus said. \u201cThere\u2019s always something else that you can look at. So it\u2019s available if I want it, but I would say I\u2019m looking at that more than I was the binders.\u201dTeams were able to test the program at the end of last season. Then, after some enhancements to the app, it became standard at the start of this season. An updated version was released after the All-Star break, allowing coaches to make handwritten notes and look at files side by side.The iPads are different from the ones consumers use. Dugout is the only app clubs can access. Even the camera is disabled.Sean True, the senior director for club services and baseball technology at the commissioner\u2019s office, said the clubs\u2019 top concern was data protection and security.Support staff members load the information that the Giants\u2019 coaches want. For Wotus, that includes scouting reports and spray charts, because he also manages the infield defense. He also uses the video of an opposing player.\u201cYou can look at plots on paper, like a spray chart, and that doesn\u2019t tell you the story,\u201d Wotus said.The Giants\u2019 hitting coach, Hensley Meulens, has players study opposing pitchers in the video room on the first day of a series. But then, when a reliever comes into the game, he will pull up his report on an iPad to provide a refresher.He also keeps a simple sheet of paper on a clipboard with information on the opposing team\u2019s pitchers. A few Giants players look at the paper, but most use an iPad, Meulens said.\u201cIt\u2019s a lot quicker to get to the player you want to get to, because you just click on him and it opens up,\u201d Meulens said. \u201cOtherwise, you have to try to find the guy as time is running.\u201dFor Mets Manager Terry Collins, turning a page is still quicker, although he also said the iPads were useful.\u201cI know people that are a lot more familiar using them are glad they\u2019re in there,\u201d he said.Meulens said he still kept a binder for backup in case of an iPad malfunction. And when several players are trying to look up information at the same time, it can be helpful to have three options: the iPad, the binder and the cheat sheet on the clipboard.The St. Louis Cardinals are one club that has not quite fully adopted the iPads. Cardinals reliever Matt Bowman said much of the team\u2019s bullpen information was relayed orally. And if he has a question, he will refer back to the bullpen coach, Blaise Ilsley.\u201cSo he\u2019s sort of our iPad in that sense,\u201d Bowman said.Baltimore Orioles Manager Buck Showalter said he would check an iPad in the dugout occasionally, sometimes when a new pitcher entered the game. But perhaps memory, at least Showalter\u2019s, is one thing the iPads can\u2019t trump.\u201cIf you\u2019re referring to that a lot when you\u2019re out here, you haven\u2019t done your homework,\u201d Showalter said. \u201cI usually have it, believe it or not, stored upstairs.\u201d James Wagner contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lyft Is Said to Seek a Buyer, Without Success", "Date": "2016-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt is not an easy thing to be an independent ride-hailing company these days.For one, it takes billions of dollars and hundreds of employees to spread to new cities, to market the service and to recruit drivers. Legislators and local laws are often not in your favor. And competitors with deep pockets from all over the world are waiting to cheer if you happen to fail.Lyft, the second-biggest ride-hailing company in the United States behind Uber, is grappling with those forces \u2014 but has found that its options are limited.The company, which is based in San Francisco, has in recent months held talks or made approaches to sell itself to companies including General Motors, Apple, Google, Amazon, Uber and Didi Chuxing, according to a dozen people who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. One person said it was Lyft who was approached by interested parties.Lyft\u2019s discussions were most serious with G.M., which is one of the ride-hailing company\u2019s largest investors. Still, G.M. never made a written offer to buy Lyft, said the people, and in the end, Lyft did not find a buyer.Lyft is not in danger of closing down and has a cash cushion of $1.4 billion, some of these people added, so the company will continue as an independent entity.Still, the talks underline how difficult it has become to operate in the ride-hailing market, where people can book rides from drivers through a smartphone app. While ride-hailing companies do not own fleets of cars and instead rely on drivers who have their own vehicles, the business is highly capital-intensive. Venture capitalists and other investors have poured billions of dollars into the companies.Lyft, a four-year-old company founded by Logan Green and John Zimmer, sprang out of an early long-distance car-pooling program, then called Zimride, in 2007. The goal, the two co-founders have said, was to create a new kind of social ride-sharing, an attempt to decrease the number of cars on the road and to improve congestion, reduce humanity\u2019s environmental footprint and create more efficiency in transportation.That idea has turned into a global movement, as companies worldwide \u2014 like Grab in Southeast Asia, Ola in India, BlaBlaCar in Europe and Uber \u2014 look to upend the global transportation infrastructure.The effort to sell Lyft was aided by bankers at Qatalyst Partners, the boutique investment bank founded by the veteran Silicon Valley banker Frank Quattrone, said the people with knowledge of the talks. Qatalyst declined to comment.Lyft also struggled to find a buyer because of the challenging economics of the ride-hailing business. Companies like Lyft and Uber typically take 20 percent to 25 percent of the cost of each ride. With Lyft drivers expected to pick up an estimated $2 billion or so in fares this year, that meant Lyft\u2019s annual revenue would be about $400 million, according to a person familiar with the company\u2019s financials.That $400 million shrinks after marketing costs are factored in. To win loyalty from drivers who can also work for Uber, Lyft also sometimes lets drivers keep that 20 percent to 25 percent of some rides, so the company effectively earns no revenue in those situations. And in some cases, Lyft provides drivers with additional cash incentives simply to get out on the road, adding to its costs.\u201cOne of the challenges for these companies is to figure out how to grow and sustain that latent demand for these businesses, but also to eventually become profitable,\u201d said Susan Shaheen, co-director of the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cPart of the challenge in evolving those services is just balancing out those factors. And that\u2019s not an easy task.\u201dLyft is not profitable, said a person briefed on the company\u2019s finances. Yet it has a $1.4 billion cash hoard, the person added, and the company thinks that will shield it as it works toward achieving profitability.Ms. Shaheen said an acquisition might still make sense for ride-hailing companies that needed more resources and a bigger size to compete.\u201cThere isn\u2019t a single company that has all of this expertise \u2014 software, manufacturing, ride-sharing \u2014 under one roof,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s where acquisition comes in.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Think Amazon\u2019s Drone Delivery Idea Is a Gimmick? Think Again", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtAmazon is the most obscure large company in the tech industry.It isn\u2019t just secretive, the way Apple is, but in a deeper sense, Jeff Bezos\u2019 e-commerce and cloud-storage giant is opaque. Amazon rarely explains either its near-term tactical aims or its long-term strategic vision. It values surprise.To understand Amazon, then, is necessarily to engage in a kind of Kremlinology. That\u2019s especially true of the story behind one of its most important business areas: the logistics by which it ships orders to its customers.So what\u2019s Amazon\u2019s ultimate aim in delivery? After talking to analysts, partners and competitors, and prying some very minimal input from Amazon itself, I suspect the company has a two-tiered vision for the future of shipping.First, it\u2019s not trying to replace third-party shippers. Instead, over the next few years, Amazon wants to add as much capacity to its operations as possible, and rather than replace partners like UPS and FedEx, it is spending boatloads on planes, trucks, crowdsourcing and other novel delivery services to add to its overall capacity and efficiency.Amazon\u2019s longer-term goal is more fantastical \u2014 and, if it succeeds, potentially transformative. It wants to escape the messy vicissitudes of roads and humans. It wants to go fully autonomous, up in the sky. The company\u2019s drone program, which many in the tech press dismissed as a marketing gimmick when Mr. Bezos unveiled it on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in 2013, is central to this future; drones could be combined with warehouses manned by robots and trucks that drive themselves to unlock a new autonomous future for Amazon.If Amazon\u2019s drone program succeeds (and Amazon says it is well on track), it could fundamentally alter the company\u2019s cost structure. A decade from now, drones would reduce the unit cost of each Amazon delivery by about half, analysts at Deutsche Bank projected in a recent research report. If that happens, the economic threat to competitors would be punishing \u2014 \u201cretail stores would cease to exist,\u201d Deutsche\u2019s analysts suggested, and we would live in a world more like that of \u201cThe Jetsons\u201d than our own.Shipping has always been at the core of Amazon\u2019s strategic investments. In its earliest days, as part of an effort to avoid collecting sales tax from most customers, Amazon purposefully placed warehouses in low-tax, low-population states, and then shipped goods to populous areas within three to five days.As consumer and commercial drones increase in popularity, the government is taking more steps to address safety concerns and regulate the aerial vehicles.The 2005 introduction of Amazon\u2019s Prime subscription program, which gives customers two-day delivery on many goods for an annual price of $99, changed Amazon\u2019s shipping needs. Prime encouraged customers to buy a lot more stuff, and it also forced Amazon to deliver packages more quickly.For Amazon, that projected future is catastrophic: Pretty much all of Amazon\u2019s current investments in shipping \u2014 in trucks, planes and crowdsourced delivery cars \u2014 depend on the traditional shipping infrastructure.All, that is, except for drones \u2014 which explains why they are integral to Amazon\u2019s vision of the future of retail.When I began talking to others in the drone industry about Amazon\u2019s interest in autonomous flight, they all pointed out that drones offer a way to leapfrog roads. Because they operate in a new, untrammeled layer of physical space \u2014 below 400 feet, an airspace that is currently unoccupied in most of the country \u2014 they open up a vast new shipping lane.Scenes like that are most likely in the far-off future. But according to Amazon, the earliest incarnation of drone deliveries will happen much sooner \u2014 we will see it within five years, somewhere in the world.Email: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Giants Gobble Start-Ups in an Antitrust Blind Spot", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDeal ProfessorLike Facebook\u2019s acquisition of WhatsApp, the Walmart deal will probably end up being another example of an upstart internet company being swallowed up to preserve the stranglehold of a giant.This happens because antitrust regulators are stuck in an outdated view of the world, while the internet giants are more attuned to their nascent competitive threats. The deal for Jet.com is just the latest defensive internet acquisition of an emerging start-up that will preserve the hegemony of a select few.And now it is being swallowed up by Walmart.This could be seen as a victory for competition. Walmart will now have a more dynamic management and brand to buttress its own internet sales operation, which trails Amazon by quite a distance. This will allow it to better compete against Amazon. The likely result is that competition in online retailing will eventually be a slugfest between Amazon and Walmart with everyone else thrown by the wayside.The problem with this narrative is that it cements the positions of Walmart and Amazon as the only players in town.This is the modus operandi of the big internet behemoths. They live in fear of new technology disrupting their businesses and killing them off.Mr. Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez was a Facebook product manager when the company faced its greatest threat: Google Plus. Facebook won because it enforced an ethos of all work, all the time, spurred by constant fear of extinction.Facebook and its elite brethren will do anything to make sure they are not the next Yahoo or Radio Shack, killed by disruption and failure to innovate. This translates into paying obscene sums for technology that might challenge their dominance one day.If you don\u2019t believe this, there is a poignant passage in \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d where Mr. Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez notes that Mark Zuckerberg saw that there were two companies with \u201chockey stick growth\u201d that matched Facebook\u2019s own: Instagram and WhatsApp. Both were amassing users at an amazing rate and both were an existential threat to Facebook.Did Mr. Zuckerberg rev up the Facebook machine to try to outcompete them? No. Instead, he bought Instagram for about $1 billion and WhatsApp for an astounding $21.8 billion.Today, Facebook is dominant, with more than 1.7 billion monthly active users. WhatsApp has more than 1 billion monthly active users and Instagram, more than 500 million.Another Google example is YouTube, which was bought for $1.65 billion in 2006 and is now a constant stream of users for Google. Indeed, YouTube, with more than one billion active monthly users, is a top driver of Alphabet\u2019s user growth.Billions of dollars are made in Silicon Valley by selling nascent upstarts to the giants. And the dominant players pay eagerly to remain dominant. That is what is going on with the Jet.com acquisition and perhaps even the $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn by Microsoft.Where are the antitrust authorities in all of this? The guiding standard under the law is that no acquisition should be allowed if it would \u201clessen competition.\u201dUnder the traditional view of antitrust, when Facebook, for example, tries to buy a company like Instagram, it can argue that anyone can start such a website. And there are other competitors like Google and Snapchat. And so this gets past the antitrust authorities, who seem more concerned with how the data will be used rather than the accumulation of users. Both United States and European Union regulators examined the WhatsApp deal, but it passed muster because WhatsApp was viewed as a messenger service, something where there was alternative competition.This misses the point that domination is all about users and views. Those companies with users and page views can dominate, and accumulating those users is everything, something only an infinitesimally small number of companies can find the key to doing.The antitrust system results in the increasing oligopoly that we have, where a few companies dominate major industries, accruing the wealth and power that go with it as potential disrupters are swallowed at birth, the way Cronus, the titan in Greek mythology, ate his young to prevent their uprising.No one knows what might happen to Jet if it remained independent. Perhaps it would fail. Amazon is dominant and Walmart may truly be the only real competitor. The same could be said of any of these acquisitions of high-growth companies. So preventing this acquisition may result not in creating a competitor to Amazon but in the eventual death of Jet. This of course would leave its founder and investors much poorer, a true cost.The flip side of this risk is that the big tech companies continue unchallenged in their dominance. Perhaps it is time to rethink antitrust enforcement, and take the risks associated with a different view of antitrust that looks at potential dominance and at breaking up oligopolies. Rhea protected Zeus from Cronus, which eventually led to Cronus\u2019s destruction.If antitrust authorities do not adapt and emerging competitors continue to be bought up, we should not be surprised of the continued dominance of a very few companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Walmart.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Duo Makes Video Calling Between Operating Systems Easier", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "Supported byTech FixGoogle and Apple have battled each other for years for primacy over mobile users. Apple has proferred its superior devices, like the iPhone. Google has fought back with its Android operating system and a series of mobile apps that are more flexible and compatible with a broader set of devices than Apple\u2019s apps.The app fits squarely into Google\u2019s playbook in mobile. Over the last few years, Google has increasingly offered its important software and internet services, including Google Maps, Google Photos and Google Docs, to iPhone customers. All of those apps were compelling alternatives to Apple\u2019s proprietary apps, like Apple Maps, Photos and Notes, because they work on a wider variety of devices, including Macs, Windows PCs, Android devices and iPhones.Duo is no exception. People can only use FaceTime to call others who have Apple devices. But Duo lets you place video calls between Android and iPhone users, and sizably increases the universe of people with whom you can hold a video conversation.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to worry about whether your call will connect, or if your friend is using the same type of device as you are,\u201d Google said in a statement, in a veiled jab at Apple. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder that nearly half of U.S. adults never make video calls on mobile.\u201dAll of this feeds into Google\u2019s strategy to attract iPhone users over to Android. Google\u2019s apps generally work better on Android devices than on iPhones, so the more that people get hooked on Google\u2019s core apps, the less incentive there is to stay loyal to Apple.Nick Fox, Google\u2019s head of communication products, said the top priority with Duo was to build a great product and to increase the use of video calling among Android users. But he added that making Android more attractive to iPhone owners was a secondary motive. He said that Duo\u2019s appeal was that it was simple to use, fast and more widely accessible.\u201cOur view is video calling should work for everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can only call half the people you know, that\u2019s very limiting.\u201d\u201cOur year-to-date iPhone sales to switchers are the greatest we\u2019ve seen in any nine-month period,\u201d Mr. Cook said in the call, without disclosing precise figures.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment beyond Mr. Cook\u2019s comments.I decided to test Duo to see how the new app plays into the debate about whether iPhone users should consider switching to Android devices. After trying an early copy of Duo and comparing it side by side with FaceTime, I found that Duo was just as intuitive and fun to use as FaceTime, but that it was too early to tell which service was more reliable.A Short HistoryThis is not the first time Google has provided video calling. Google started offering mobile video calling several years ago inside its Hangouts app, which also includes messaging and voice-calling capabilities. The video-calling feature in Hangouts will remain intact.Crystal Dahlen, a Google spokeswoman, said the name Duo conveyed that the app was designed for one-to-one video calling on mobile devices, in contrast to Hangouts, which lets groups of people make video calls over mobile devices and computers. Duo will roll out globally over the next few days.FaceTime, in contrast, is now six years old. When Apple unveiled the video-calling ability in iPhones in 2010, Steven P. Jobs, Apple\u2019s co-founder, said he had dreamed of mobile video calling since he grew up watching \u201cThe Jetsons\u201d and \u201cStar Trek.\u201d Apple later expanded FaceTime to work with iPads and Macs, among other Apple products. The company has not published statistics on FaceTime use, but the technology helped make mobile video calling mainstream.Duo Versus FaceTimeThe Duo app is downloadable and free through Google\u2019s Play store and Apple\u2019s App Store. When you open the Duo app, there is just one button: video call. Tapping that loads your contacts list, and from there you can choose whom to call.Duo starts streaming video to a recipient as soon as the call is placed, meaning the person you are calling will be able to see you waving or making faces before he or she picks up. Google calls this feature Knock Knock. It can be disabled in case you have friends who are likely to make inappropriate hand gestures.With FaceTime, you place a call directly through the iPhone\u2019s contacts list or through the separate FaceTime app. The recipient does not see the video streaming until after the call is answered.I placed video calls over Duo and FaceTime over a strong Wi-Fi connection as well as a weak cellular connection. In the tests, the video calls looked clearer on Duo, though that is an unreliable measure because very few people are currently able to use Duo, so the network is unrealistically uncongested. When more people use Duo, we can expect the picture quality to vary depending on network traffic and internet speeds.There is a minor difference for Duo between Android and iPhone users. An Android user receiving a Duo call will see a Knock Knock video on the home screen by default. Those using Apple devices will see a notification on top of the screen and will have to open the Duo app before seeing Knock Knock in action. Otherwise, the app works the same for both Android and iPhone.Against the RestI also compared Duo calls with video calls placed over Microsoft\u2019s Skype and Facebook Messenger. Against those two, Duo\u2019s simplicity won hands down.In Facebook\u2019s Messenger app, the video-calling feature is embedded in the corner of a message box, so it is hard to find and not intuitive to use. In fact, every call I have ever made with Messenger has been by mistake.On Skype, the video-calling feature is in a place similar to Messenger\u2019s, in the corner of a message box. More annoyingly, to find other Skype users you have to manually add them to your Skype contacts list or toggle on an option to synchronize your address book with Skype.The Bottom LineFor now, FaceTime is just as intuitive as Duo so I see no compelling reason to use Duo over FaceTime to call iPhone users.But if I had to video call an Android user, I would use Duo over other video-calling services like Skype or Facebook Messenger, which have more cluttered interfaces than Duo\u2019s single-button approach.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Daily Report: More Clean Energy, Brought to You by the Cloud", "Date": "2016-08-24", "News": "Supported byBitsThe cloud, as it turns out, may have a very green lining.A prime reason for this is the growing demand from its cloud computing centers, where Apple keeps its customers\u2019 music, photos and much more.On this front, Apple joins a number of other cloud providers, who collectively may change the face of energy production by increasing demand for renewable energy.Big cloud-computing companies are building facilities on an unparalleled scale, and at a time when few others are increasing demand. Dominion Virginia Power, which supplies perhaps the world\u2019s greatest concentration of data centers, reported that overall demand rose 1 percent last year, but demand from data centers rose 9 percent.Amazon Web Services has since committed to obtaining 100 percent of its power from renewable sources. Last year the company purchased a 250,000-panel, 80-megawatt plant in Virginia, which it later sold to Dominion.Other data centers have long been situated near big dams, which provide cheap as well as green power. Lots of building is happening in Iowa, Texas and elsewhere in America\u2019s great wind corridor, to encourage the construction of more wind-driven facilities.Remote locations have other benefits. \u201cWhen your nearest neighbor is 100 acres away, you don\u2019t get as many complaints about the power lines,\u201d said Joe Kava, who heads Google\u2019s data center operations.There are signs it is affecting the way utilities plan future construction. American Electric Power, which operates in 11 states, has said it will add 6,300 megawatts of new wind power and 3,100 megawatts of new solar generation before 2033. An AEP official told me that much of this was attributable to demand from data centers.For many of these companies, it\u2019s not just about saving the planet; power has moved from an incidental cost to a main determinant of profitability. Like nothing else, that has affected the operation of data centers in ways that may improve other big companies\u2019 power consumption.The traditional measure of data center efficiency is power usage effectiveness, or P.U.E. This measures how much power goes into a data center and how much of that is used by computing equipment. For a poorly run center, this number can be 2.0 or higher, meaning it takes two watts of power to put one watt into a computer.Together, these companies are building with their clouds a new kind of industrial infrastructure. It would be something if it also reshaped our power usage for the better.Advertisement"}

The hope is that the money will be an incentive to keep those flaws out of the hands of organized groups or spy agencies willing to pay big money to learn about them.But Apple had stayed away from the practice. Instead, it had credited anyone who turned over bugs by putting their names on its website \u2014 a far cry from the tens of thousands of dollars, and in some cases hundreds of thousands of dollars, companies like Google and Facebook were willing to pay.The annual Black Hat conference, now in its 19th year, is a gathering place for all sorts of experts on computer security, including hackers, tech industry executives and government officials.Dan Kaminsky, a respected security researcher, said in a keynote speech that the industry was falling far short of expectations. The onslaught of regular, high-profile hacks, like the recent penetration of computers run by the Democratic National Committee, is beginning to make customers believe that little can be done to protect them.\u201cWe made promises in technology, and people are starting not to believe them\u201d Mr. Kaminsky told the audience. \u201cEverybody looks busy but the house still burns.\u201d Mr. Kaminsky argued for a cybersecurity equivalent of the National Institutes of Health or a Manhattan Project to fund research.Notably, a fund-raiser for Hillary Clinton coincided with this year\u2019s conference. Tickets for the \u201cHackers for Hillary\u201d fund-raiser were going for anywhere from $100 to $2,700.

WhatsApp won\u2019t share message content, names, addresses and other personal content.Also, they posted a picture of Harambe, the gorilla that was killed at the Cincinnati Zoo this year. Harambe had already become a weird meme on Twitter, but the Jones attack added another dimension \u2014 basically, Harambe is now a racist trope.I don\u2019t know what to say other than, why are any of us still online, Mike?Clearly there are racists and misogynists all over the web who take great pleasure in knocking famous women down for no reason whatsoever.But perhaps even worse are the hangers-on who do it for no reason \u2014 for \u201cthe lulz,\u201d as one hacker group used to say. It\u2019s this weird code \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 of internet nihilism, a willingness to attack targets just because they\u2019re visible. Ms. Jones did not do anything to provoke this. She\u2019s just herself online. And no one should be the target of an attack just because they have a Twitter account.In an unrelated matter, please never look at my Twitter account.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Is Said to Owe Back Taxes to Irish Government", "Date": "2016-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe European Union\u2019s competition authorities are poised to announce a major tax ruling against Apple\u2019s tax dealings with the Irish government on Tuesday, a decision that will likely increase trans-Atlantic tension over how some of the world\u2019s largest companies pay taxes on their global operations.The ruling, expected to be announced early Tuesday in Brussels, will result in Apple having to pay back taxes to the Irish government, according to three people briefed on the decision who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The amount is anticipated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars, one of these people said.The decision is set to further stoke tensions between American officials and their European counterparts, with Europe claiming the right to oversee tax policies for companies like Apple and Amazon, among others, that have used complicated tax structures in nations like Ireland and Luxembourg to reduce the amount of corporate tax they pay in other countries.\u201cThis will be framed by the U.S. as Europe overreaching,\u201d said Edward Kleinbard, a professor at the University of Southern California\u2019s Gould School of Law and a former chief of staff to the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. \u201cThat overreaction will make it a lot more difficult to police companies\u2019 international tax structures.\u201dApple, Irish authorities and European competition authorities declined to comment. The tax decision was earlier reported by RTE, the Irish broadcaster.Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s top antitrust official, is expected to say on Tuesday that the Irish government gave Apple preferential treatment on its local tax arrangements. These deals, related to agreements from 1991 and 2007, gave Apple an unfair advantage over other companies, and broke Europe\u2019s so-called state-aid rules that forbid any government from providing unfair assistance to certain companies over others, she is expected to say.Ireland can appeal any judgment by suing in the Court of Justice of the European Union to stop any resulting penalty, and Apple could seek to support such an appeal. Such appeals are likely to take years.For Apple, the potential tax clawback would be a blow to the company\u2019s approximately 30 years of activity in Ireland, where it currently employs around 5,500 people, mostly in Cork, a city in the south of the country.The tech giant has repeatedly denied that it received unfair tax treatment from Irish authorities, saying that it complies with all tax laws wherever it operates. While Apple has a large operation in Ireland, the company said its main corporate tax liabilities remain within the United States where it is based and conducts the majority of its research and development.The European Commission has been seeking a greater say over tax issues for decades. Those efforts accelerated after the 2008 financial crisis amid complaints that prosperous corporations were enjoying tax breaks while citizens faced mounting tax demands and cuts to their public services.Ms. Vestager has already ordered Luxembourg to claw back 30 million euros, or $33 million, from Fiat, the Italian carmaker, and the Netherlands to recover a similar amount from Starbucks. Both Luxembourg and the Netherlands have appealed those decisions. She still is investigating similar cases in Luxembourg affecting Amazon and McDonald\u2019s.Last year, in another case, Ms. Vestager ordered France to recover \u20ac1.4 billion, or $1.6 billion, from state-controlled \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France for failing to pay enough corporation tax in 1997. At the time, E.D.F. said it would make the reimbursement but was considering an appeal to the Court of Justice of the European Union.\u201cOur aim is very simple,\u201d Ms. Vestager said in an interview earlier this year. \u201cProfits should be taxed where profits are made.\u201dThe European Union\u2019s investigation into the Irish treatment of Apple began under Ms. Vestager\u2019s predecessor, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia. It was prompted in part by a United States Senate investigation in 2013 that found that Apple, the world\u2019s largest public company by market capitalization, sheltered tens of billions of dollars in profit from tax in offshore entities including in Ireland. The European Commission opened a formal investigation in June 2014 into whether the tax deals granted to Apple in Ireland amounted to illegal state support.Ireland strongly objected to the investigation. The ruling is likely to be a hard pill to swallow for the country, which has spent decades championing its low corporate tax rate and other tax breaks to entice American companies to its shores.The Irish government has said that it will appeal any tax decision announced by European officials, putting the country in the somewhat odd position of turning down potentially billions of dollars of extra revenue from Apple.\u201cThe decision by the Irish government to fight this case is bizarre,\u201d said James Stewart, a professor at Trinity College, Dublin. \u201cThe Irish government is opposed to any global tax harmonization because it will harm its ability to attract foreign direct investment.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It wants the Alexa Voice Service, which powers Echo, to be an ingredient in devices around the home and beyond, even if they aren\u2019t made by Amazon.The vision of an omnipresent intelligent assistant is one Amazon shares, in one form or another, with most other big technology companies, including Apple, Google and Microsoft. Along with a handful of start-ups, these companies see their intelligent assistants as powerful new ways for users to interact with devices and internet services \u2014 just as smartphone touch screens were.Many technology specialists think that people will be O.K. with a single intelligent assistant in their lives but that most won\u2019t have the patience to regularly use two or three of them, each with its individual quirks. As a result, each company is racing to weave its assistant into as many devices and services as possible.\u201cWe\u2019re taking $180 worth of utility and adding it into a $200 device,\u201d he said.Ford Motor is working with Amazon to integrate Alexa into its vehicles so drivers can control smart-home features like lights, thermostats and security systems from their cars.Over 10,000 developers have registered to integrate Alexa into their products, Amazon said. It won\u2019t say how many Echo units it has sold, except to say that millions of devices with Alexa in them have been purchased.In an interview this spring, David Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for devices, said that the company wanted there to be as many Alexa-linked \u201cendpoints\u201d around the home as possible and that Amazon did not really care who made those devices. Amazon has expanded its lineup of devices that use Alexa with its Echo Dot, a miniature version of the Echo speaker, and Amazon Tap, a portable Bluetooth speaker.\u201cThe longer-term vision is a little bit like the \u2018Star Trek\u2019 computer,\u201d Mr. Limp said. \u201cCaptain Kirk or Picard could sit on the bridge and ask anything and get the right answer.\u201dBut while Amazon has made a lot of progress in this regard, it may have a hard time extending Alexa\u2019s reach outside the home because of its weaknesses in mobile technology, analysts say.The success of Echo has been described as a redemption of sorts for Amazon after it suffered a brutal defeat in the smartphone market with its Fire Phone, which the company stopped selling after poor sales \u2014 a misstep that has left Amazon vulnerable.Apple and Google have clear advantages over Amazon because of their dominant positions in the mobile market. And they are pushing their versions of Alexa \u2014 Siri and Google\u2019s assistant \u2014 as ways to control other devices throughout the home.As intelligent assistants improve in quality, Jan Dawson, an analyst at Jackdaw Research, thinks people will want these virtual helpers to follow them all day like a companion. \u201cWhat you want from an assistant is that they are always available to you everywhere,\u201d he said.While Amazon could eventually give people access to Alexa\u2019s functions through apps on smartphones (a couple of apps from independent developers do this already), Mr. Dawson is skeptical that Amazon will be able to make them work as well as assistants more deeply integrated into smartphones by Apple and Google.\u201cThey\u2019re basically absent on smartphones, which are devices we take everywhere we go,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Takeover Effort, but Rivals Could Force Its Hand", "Date": "2016-08-15", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsIt was probably only a matter of time before G.M. made a move, after it paid $500 million in January for a stake in Lyft and took a seat on Lyft\u2019s board. In March, the companies unveiled a deal to lease G.M. vehicles to Lyft drivers. They also plan to collaborate on building a fleet of autonomous on-demand vehicles.Speculation about Lyft\u2019s future heated up in June when information emerged that the company had hired the Silicon Valley investment bank Qatalyst Partners, which was founded by Frank Quattrone. Qatalyst is known for helping clients find lucrative exits.Despite the mounting pressures, it\u2019s understandable that Lyft\u2019s founders, Logan Green and John Zimmer, would want to try to stay independent, at least for a while longer. G.M. has been investing heavily in driverless technology, but so have many of its peers, as well as the likes of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, and Apple. So there is no guarantee the carmaker will come up with a winning product.With software, rather than powertrain, a valuable component of autonomous vehicles, Lyft has little incentive to sell for anything other than top dollar. It would also presumably find it easier to recruit top programming talent as an independent company.Lyft may run out of road eventually. Being second to the much-larger Uber is a major disadvantage in an industry where drivers and riders prefer the largest, most active network. An expensive battle for ride-hailing supremacy would distract from the bigger prize: a chance to fundamentally disrupt car ownership with driverless technology \u2014 an opportunity Mr. Zimmer estimates is worth over $2 trillion per year in the United States alone, including the cost of buying, maintaining and insuring cars.

{"Headline": "Even Uber Couldn\u2019t Bridge the China Divide", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtTravis Kalanick, the co-founder and chief executive of the ride-hailing giant Uber, often defended his eagerness to risk billions on winning the Chinese market with a simple question: If you have a chance to become Amazon and Alibaba at the same time, why not try?The implication was simple. Over the last couple of decades, Amazon, Facebook, Google and other American technology giants have each followed a similar script for world domination. Like an imperial armada rolling out from North America\u2019s West Coast, these companies would try to establish beachheads on every other continent.But when American giants tried to enter the waters of China, the world\u2019s largest internet market, the armada invariably ran aground.Plagued by opaque and ever-shifting regulations and a culturally abstruse way of doing business, American companies fell to a series of local giants. Instead of Google, Baidu. Instead of Facebook, WeChat, owned by the giant Tencent. And instead of Amazon, Alibaba.That has left us with a divide: Today, there is the Chinese internet, and there is the internet of the rest of the world. A network seen in its early days as a tool to foster financial and political unity across a fragmented planet has irrevocably cleaved into two completely separate spheres.Entrepreneurs across the globe can choose to win in China or the rest of the world. You can be Alibaba or you can be Amazon. You can be Uber or you can be Didi. But you can\u2019t be both. Given the rising Chinese market and increasing tension over the role of American tech firms in the rest of the globe, the gulf between the two sides promises to become one of the most important factors in determining the shape of global tech innovation.How exactly might the war play out? In some ways, being at the mercy of two poles of internet leadership could be good for citizens of planet Earth. In emerging markets like India, the Middle East and parts of Africa and South America, the giants of China and the United States are increasingly investing billions to compete for local customers in e-commerce, social networking, ride sharing and other markets.\u201cAmazon is increasingly making its own branded products, taking on Procter & Gamble and others, and also getting into the logistics business, and shipping, and everything else,\u201d Mr. Clark said. \u201cBut Alibaba is a marketplace that doesn\u2019t hold inventory and describes themselves as helping local merchants \u2014 so maybe there\u2019s some argument that Alibaba could serve as a counter globally to Amazon.\u201d\u201cIn that way it could be like the Yalta Conference,\u201d said Mr. Clark, referring to the 1945 meeting in which the victors of World War II determined the postwar geopolitical order.\u201cThe barrels that will be thrown at you when you\u2019re trying to do business in China will just never stop,\u201d said Mark Natkin, the managing director of Marbridge Consulting, an advisory firm based in Beijing. \u201cYou\u2019ll constantly be above one barrel or recovering from jumping one, and as you\u2019re dusting yourself off you look down the road and here comes the next one.\u201dCompared with previous failures, Uber seemed to do everything right in China. It set up a separate company, Uber China, which had a buy-in from local investors, including from a local giant, Baidu. It hired many local experts, and worked closely with the national government to foster friendly relations.Insiders say Mr. Kalanick was also personally invested in the deal. He visited China eight times in the last year and a half, and became something of a tech star in the Chinese media.Publicly Mr. Kalanick had insisted he was fighting for total victory in China. But he must have known that Uber would always struggle to achieve dominance, given the emerging centrality of ride-sharing to the future of infrastructure in China. Still, even if he failed to win everything in China, investing early in the country seemed too big to skip.For now, it\u2019s especially delicious frosting. The $2 billion Uber spent tackling China is now worth about $7 billion in the new merged entity; if Didi does become one of China\u2019s largest tech companies, the value of Uber\u2019s stake in China could rise geometrically, making the firm much more attractive in a potential initial public offering. Pulling out of China also frees up Uber to invest more in other markets \u2014 India and Indonesia are big targets \u2014 as well as expand its expertise in core technological initiatives like mapping data and self-driving cars.But if spending big to tackle China ultimately works out for Uber, it will be an anomaly, and certainly not a model for other American tech giants.\u201cThe ride-sharing market is one the few markets where the upside is big enough to justify going in,\u201d Mr. Thompson said. \u201cFor most other companies, going into China is still going to be nothing but pain.\u201dEmail: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Becomes a Green Energy Supplier, With Itself as Customer", "Date": "2016-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 The words are stenciled on the front of the Apple Store, a glass box sandwiched between a nondescript Thai restaurant and a CVS pharmacy in downtown Palo Alto: \u201cThis store runs on 100 percent renewable energy.\u201dIf Apple\u2019s plans play out, it will be able to make that claim not only for its operations throughout California but also beyond, as the company aims to meet its growing needs for electricity with green sources like solar, wind and hydroelectric power.Like other big companies before it, including Walmart and Google, Apple recently received a federal designation for its energy subsidiary that allows it to become a wholesale seller of electricity from coast to coast. In effect, Apple is creating its own green utility company, although the main customer is itself.The motives may be economic as much as they are environmental. As a wholesaler, Apple could reduce the cost of its electricity load, which reached 831 million kilowatt-hours in the last fiscal year \u2014 enough to power about 76,000 homes for a year. But like a growing number of corporations, Apple is intent on reducing carbon dioxide emissions from electricity production \u2014 one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.In one ambitious venture, Apple has contracted with First Solar to begin buying a little less than half of the power later this year from California Flats, a solar energy farm now under construction. Under the terms of the deal, Apple will pay $848 million for the electricity over 25 years and receive the farm\u2019s total output by the end of the agreement. It is one of largest commercial clean energy contracts yet.Lisa Jackson, the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency who is now the Apple executive overseeing environmental policy, social initiatives and worldwide government affairs, said she hoped Apple could serve as a model for the many other big corporate power users that are now embracing clean energy.\u201cThis is just another sort of innovative way to get that power onto the grid so we don\u2019t have to take the California grid-mix default, which still includes fossil fuel,\u201d Ms. Jackson said.Although much of Apple\u2019s manufacturing is done offshore, it still has extensive needs for electric power in the United States \u2014 and not only for the sprawling new corporate campus it is building at its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., and its 270 retail stores around the country.One of Apple\u2019s biggest demands for electricity comes from operating the computing cloud through which it sells apps, music and videos to users of its iPhones, iPads and Mac computers.Apple\u2019s move comes as prices for renewable energy continue to plummet. And signing long-term contracts allows businesses to shield themselves from potentially higher, more volatile charges from a power company. Apple would not say how much it was paying for California Flats\u2019s energy, but Ms. Jackson said last year at a Wall Street Journal conference that it was less than what it paid for commercial power. She said she expected the company to save hundreds of millions of dollars over the life of the contract.Google, which received its federal energy wholesale designation from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 2010, is a big proponent of the approach Apple is now taking.\u201cRunning any kind of business, having predictability in terms of your operating costs can be very important,\u201d said Gary Demasi, director of operations for data center energy and location strategy at Google, which has been a leading investor in and user of clean energy. \u201cRenewable energy, from a cost perspective, is now competitive with other forms of energy, much more so than it was a few years ago.\u201dExecutives face greater pressure from shareholders and customers to show that they are doing their part to fight climate change. At the same time, corporate energy use has exploded, driven in many cases by the ravenous demands of the data cloud.\u201cWe are all becoming very large energy players, and this is a shift,\u201d said Brian Janous, director of energy strategy at Microsoft. \u201cEnergy is not something that Microsoft or Amazon or Google really ever had to think much about prior to the advent of the cloud.\u201dElectric utilities have begun to respond by creating products and services to meet the corporate demand for clean energy, said Letha Tawney, the World Resources Institute\u2019s director of utility innovation.One such product is a green tariff. It was pioneered in North Carolina by Duke Energy and is now under consideration in about a dozen states. It allows companies to designate that they are paying for a renewable energy supply.Another is a synthetic or virtual power purchase agreement, under which companies contract to buy the output of a clean power plant, as Apple is doing with California Flats.Although the companies say these arrangements mean they are running their businesses on renewable energy, in reality the clean power often does not flow directly to their facilities. They typically buy the renewable energy in amounts to match what they draw from the grid \u2014 a system of swaps that Ms. Jackson of Apple likened to using an A.T.M.\u201cThe dollar you deposit in the bank might not be the exact same bill that you get out,\u201d she said.Robert F. Shapiro, a partner at the law firm Chadbourne & Parke who focuses on project finance and energy, describes it as meaningful symbolism.\u201cThey\u2019re actually getting power from their local utility, which may be coal,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cBut they\u2019re deemed to have put into the world carbon-neutral energy, which they are deemed to have used for their load.\u201dTo keep track of the clean energy credits, power generators work with registries to issue numbered certificates.\u201cThe power flows into the grid. The electrons go where they go,\u201d Ms. Tawney said. \u201cBut because there\u2019s a renewable-energy certificate, no one else can claim the same zero-carbon benefit.\u201dSuch complexities are necessary, executives and clean energy advocates say, because it is not often feasible to install enough renewable-power generators at corporate sites to meet companies\u2019 full energy needs.Walmart, despite having installed solar panels, wind turbines and fuel cells at stores and distribution centers, can nonetheless meet only about a third of those operations\u2019 energy needs. So it also buys renewable energy from generators and utilities, said David Ozment, director of energy at Walmart stores.Procter & Gamble, another member of the energy buyers\u2019 alliance, has arranged to purchase all of the steam from a biomass generator under construction at a plant in Georgia where it makes Charmin toilet paper and Bounty paper towels, said Jack McAneny, the company\u2019s director of sustainability.But that was possible, he said, only because of the plant\u2019s location near a source of waste wood and pulp for fuel and the cooperation of P&G\u2019s partners. Among those partners are the local utility, Georgia Power, which will buy the electricity from the generator for its customers from Constellation, the company that developed and will own and operate the generator.At Apple, where the purchase or production of renewable energy has more than tripled since 2012, the company would prefer to not have to go to great lengths to ensure a clean energy supply, Ms. Jackson said. But the public energy grid is simply still too dependent on carbon-based fuels to make that possible.\u201cIf we had our preference, we\u2019d just be able to say, \u2018We want 100 percent green power everywhere we use power,\u2019\u201d Ms. Jackson said. \u201cThe best would be if we could run every one of our stores, every one of our data centers, every office complex, every building we have, on 100 percent renewable \u2014 and if we didn\u2019t have to spend a whole bunch of our time and energy figuring out how to get that done.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Uber to Sell to Rival Didi Chuxing and Create New Business in China", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Uber\u2019s future in China seemed to hold promise.The sale, which would create a new company worth about $35 billion, would end the great ride-hailing battle of China. A person with knowledge of the deal said Uber investors had been pushing for such a transaction.The companies have been fighting relentlessly for market share in mainland China for two years, spending tens of millions of dollars every month to attract riders and drivers. The merger would end that competition and create significant scale, but it would also be a repudiation of Uber\u2019s ambitions to take on local Chinese competitors in their huge home market.Uber had pushed its way into a country that has gone almost untouched by major American tech companies in recent years. Its progress was widely watched and discussed by entrepreneurs and investors alike as a model for how to reach China\u2019s 600 million internet users \u2014 a forbidding prospect considering the country\u2019s well-funded local competitors and regulations aimed at blocking foreign businesses.With the deal, the company will join the ranks of American peers like Google and eBay, which were unable to capitalize on early footholds in China. EBay was outmaneuvered by Alibaba, while Google left China after it said it was the target of government-sponsored cyberattacks.Still, it is by no means a financial catastrophe for Uber, which for about $2 billion of investment in the Chinese market gets a $7 billion share in a company that is likely to grow. It also saves the cash it may have spent competing in China for other projects.\u201cHowever, as an entrepreneur, I\u2019ve learned that being successful is about listening to your head as well as following your heart,\u201d he wrote. \u201cUber and Didi Chuxing are investing billions of dollars in China and both companies have yet to turn a profit there.\u201dUnder the terms of the deal, the new company\u2019s estimated worth is a combination of Didi Chuxing\u2019s $28 billion valuation and Uber China\u2019s $7 billion, according to two people with knowledge of the deal, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the information had not yet been made public. Uber shareholders would receive a 20 percent stake in the new company.Over the past two years, Uber upended expectations in China and its business there grew, despite heavy regulation and internet filters that often limit access to the products of foreign tech companies. The early 2015 rollout of People\u2019s Uber, a service that got ordinary Chinese drivers behind the wheel and taking passengers, helped Uber grab a chunk of market share from Didi.As it grew in China, Uber avoided many of the mistakes made by of its American tech forebears. For one, the company created local teams based around different cities, allowing it to respond quickly and flexibly to moves by the competition. That set it apart from other companies, which sought to control Chinese operations from the United States, slowing their responses.But entry is just the first obstacle to the Chinese internet market. Competition is fierce, and the focus is less on the product than on big spending to lure customers or on tricks to harm competitors. Fraudsters and opportunists also abound.Uber\u2019s engineers, operating from San Francisco, had to deal with drivers who simulated or faked rides to get commissions. At the same time, the company was blocked from marketing on China\u2019s biggest social network, WeChat, because the internet giant Tencent was an early investor in Didi. All of that made it much harder to compete with a company that already had an advantage in scale, not to mention the backing of Tencent, Alibaba and Apple. When it raised $7 billion in June, Didi made it clear it was willing to continue the fight for a long time.For all the publicity around the spat between Uber and Didi, the two had been in talks stretching back to the Didi-Kuaidi merger in the beginning of 2015, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. That person said the two sides could not overcome disagreements about valuations at the time.In another quirk to the latest deal, two members of the same well-known family in the world of technology were on opposite sides of the negotiating table: Didi\u2019s president, Jean Liu, is the daughter of Liu Chuanzhi, the Chinese founder of the largest computer maker in the world, Lenovo. Her cousin, Zhen Liu, is a vice president and regular spokeswoman for Uber China.Although the tie-up is expected to reassure investors, Chinese analysts said it would probably lead to a decrease in commissions. That could hurt customers and drivers alike, the analysts said, making it harder for smaller players to compete because their larger rival would no longer be saddled with such an expense.\u201cFor smaller companies like Yidao or Shenzhou, if they keep subsidizing users, it will only be temporary and will bring more financial burdens,\u201d said Hong Bo, an independent technology analyst in China.Li Bo, a 22-year-old driver from Henan, said the loyalty of drivers is determined by where they could get the best pay. That meant they would continue to follow the subsidies, he said.\u201cAll we care is who gives us the best deal,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Didi buys Uber, we just work for Didi. It doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201dPaul Mozur reported from Hong Kong, and Mike Isaac from San Francisco. Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting from New York.

{"Headline": "Apple, Congress and the Missing Taxes", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialApple and the United States are crying foul over the ruling in Europe that Apple received illegal tax breaks from Ireland and must hand over 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion), a record tax penalty in Europe.But Apple and the United States have only themselves to blame for the situation.Initially, deferral was a convenience for multinationals, as they sought investment opportunities abroad. Today, it is the taproot of global tax avoidance. Financial engineering has let American companies shift profits into foreign accounts, while they lobby Congress for tax-rate cuts in exchange for repatriating the money. Currently, there is some $2 trillion in corporate profits in offshore tax-deferred accounts; besides Apple, Microsoft, Google, Cisco and Oracle also have large stashes. Apple is one of nearly two dozen major corporations pushing Congress for a \u201ctax holiday,\u201d which would let companies bring back foreign-held money over the course of a year at a discounted tax rate, rather than the current rate, 35 percent.Before the European ruling on Tuesday, the debate over a tax holiday had pitted Republicans, who have generally favored the idea, against Democrats, who have viewed it as an unjustified reward for tax avoidance. The Democrats have history on their side. A tax holiday in 2005 lowered the corporate rate to 5.25 percent, enticing corporations to repatriate some $300 billion. It was billed as a way to create jobs and increase investment, but the money was used mostly for dividend payments, share buybacks (which tend to raise executive pay) and severance for laid-off employees. Worse, the tax holiday inspired multinationals to stash as much money abroad as they possibly could in anticipation of another holiday.The European ruling, however, could sharply alter the terms of the congressional debate. Republicans and Democrats alike have always assumed that foreign-held profits would one day be repatriated. The big question was the rate at which they would ultimately be taxed. Similarly, the Treasury assumes that deferred foreign profits will one day be taxed when it projects future revenues \u2014 an important measure of the nation\u2019s fiscal health.But the money won\u2019t be repatriated and taxed under American law if Europeans, in the course of enforcing their own laws against tax havens, get their hands on it first. And that, in a nutshell, is why members of Congress and Treasury officials are so upset about the Apple ruling. They understand, correctly, that tax-law enforcement in Europe could reduce the sums they expect to collect taxes on someday. What they don\u2019t understand, or aren\u2019t saying, is that they brought the problem on themselves.The way forward is not to declare a tax war with Europe. It is for Congress to agree on a way to tax foreign-held corporate profits. President Obama put forth a reasonable approach in 2015, when he proposed a mandatory 14 percent tax on multinationals\u2019 current offshore profits \u2014 whether they are repatriated or not \u2014 and, thereafter, a new minimum tax rate of 19 percent on profits moved offshore. An even better approach would be to simply end indefinite corporate tax deferral, imposing American taxes on profits when they are made.Republicans rejected Mr. Obama\u2019s proposal in 2015, and there is no chance that lawmakers will engage in such a debate so close to the election. But the next president and Congress will need to act to ensure that at long last, American corporations pay their fair share in taxes.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Florida Company Gets Approval to Put Robotic Lander on Moon", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA small start-up has received the green light from the federal government to do something that NASA has not done for more than four decades: land on the moon.Moon Express has a ways to go before it can reach the lunar surface, which it hopes to do next year. It still has to assemble the lander. The rocket that it plans to launch on has yet to fly even once.And one of its competitors could beat it to the moon, and the $20 million.The approval reflects an effort to encourage 21st-century commercial space endeavors while staying within an international space treaty written 49 years ago when outer space was a rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, and the idea of a start-up going to the moon an unlikely fantasy.The Juno spacecraft has reached Jupiter. Here are some other spacecraft exploring our solar system, launched by NASA and the world\u2019s other space agencies.In the bubbly optimism that followed, the X Prize Foundation enlisted Google to finance reaching the loftier target of the moon. The Google Lunar X Prize, announced in 2007, called for putting a spacecraft on the moon that would be able to send back video and images and also move more than 500 meters. The first team to achieve that would claim $20 million; second place would be rewarded with $5 million.For John Noble Wilford, the reporter who covered the moon landing for The New York Times from mission control in Houston, the memory is invigorating.As Moon Express worked on its MX-1 lander, company officials realized that they had other hurdles: paperwork and international treaties.The United States fought to include that clause, rejecting the Soviet view that space exploration should be limited to governments, said Matthew Schaefer, the director of the space, cyber and telecommunications law program at the University of Nebraska.While the American negotiators did not necessarily foresee a company like Moon Express, \u201cthe U.S. government wanted to keep that option open,\u201d Professor Schaefer said.Nonetheless, that would have been a roadblock, said Dr. Richards, Moon Express\u2019s chief executive, because the United States did not have any procedures for authorizing and supervising what companies like Moon Express want to do.\u201cAny application to the U.S. government would have been vetoed by the State Department, due to the lack of regulatory frameworks that would allow the U.S. government to remain in compliance with the Outer Space Treaty,\u201d he said.Moon Express has now employed this payload review process for its lunar trip. The F.A.A. sent its approval on July 20, the 47th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing on the moon.Mr. Jain said that low-cost missions to the moon \u2014 under $10 million \u2014 would transform space exploration. But the company has revealed little about its customers and much of the hoped-for business like the mining of platinum and helium-3 is speculative. (The helium-3 would be for fusion power plants that do not yet exist.)At present, there is little worry that the moonscape is about to be scarred by a commercial onslaught. The MX-1 is about the size of a coffee table, and NASA has left far more litter on the moon, most recently crashing its Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer into the far side of the moon in 2014.Of more concern is the preservation of earlier artifacts like the Apollo landing sites, especially as the Lunar X Prize offers a $4 million bonus for broadcasting video from one of those sites.Moon Express said that it had not yet decided on a landing site, but that it would defer to NASA\u2019s wishes and stay away from the Apollo sites.Mr. Jain said the greatest opportunities were the ones not yet imagined, just as Apple, when it created the iPhone, did not foresee the explosion of apps that would run on the device.\u201cMore importantly,\u201d Mr. Jain said, \u201cwe don\u2019t know what the Pok\u00e9mon Go of the moon is going to be.\u201dAn earlier version of this article gave an outdated location for the headquarters of Moon Express.

{"Headline": "Apple Becomes a Green Energy Supplier, With Itself as Customer", "Date": "2016-08-23", "News": "Supported byPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 The words are stenciled on the front of the Apple Store, a glass box sandwiched between a nondescript Thai restaurant and a CVS pharmacy in downtown Palo Alto: \u201cThis store runs on 100 percent renewable energy.\u201dIf Apple\u2019s plans play out, it will be able to make that claim not only for its operations throughout California but also beyond, as the company aims to meet its growing needs for electricity with green sources like solar, wind and hydroelectric power.Like other big companies before it, including Walmart and Google, Apple recently received a federal designation for its energy subsidiary that allows it to become a wholesale seller of electricity from coast to coast. In effect, Apple is creating its own green utility company, although the main customer is itself.The motives may be economic as much as they are environmental. As a wholesaler, Apple could reduce the cost of its electricity load, which reached 831 million kilowatt-hours in the last fiscal year \u2014 enough to power about 76,000 homes for a year. But like a growing number of corporations, Apple is intent on reducing carbon dioxide emissions from electricity production \u2014 one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.In one ambitious venture, Apple has contracted with First Solar to begin buying a little less than half of the power later this year from California Flats, a solar energy farm now under construction. Under the terms of the deal, Apple will pay $848 million for the electricity over 25 years and receive the farm\u2019s total output by the end of the agreement. It is one of largest commercial clean energy contracts yet.Lisa Jackson, the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency who is now the Apple executive overseeing environmental policy, social initiatives and worldwide government affairs, said she hoped Apple could serve as a model for the many other big corporate power users that are now embracing clean energy.\u201cThis is just another sort of innovative way to get that power onto the grid so we don\u2019t have to take the California grid-mix default, which still includes fossil fuel,\u201d Ms. Jackson said.Although much of Apple\u2019s manufacturing is done offshore, it still has extensive needs for electric power in the United States \u2014 and not only for the sprawling new corporate campus it is building at its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., and its 270 retail stores around the country.One of Apple\u2019s biggest demands for electricity comes from operating the computing cloud through which it sells apps, music and videos to users of its iPhones, iPads and Mac computers.Apple\u2019s move comes as prices for renewable energy continue to plummet. And signing long-term contracts allows businesses to shield themselves from potentially higher, more volatile charges from a power company. Apple would not say how much it was paying for California Flats\u2019s energy, but Ms. Jackson said last year at a Wall Street Journal conference that it was less than what it paid for commercial power. She said she expected the company to save hundreds of millions of dollars over the life of the contract.Google, which received its federal energy wholesale designation from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 2010, is a big proponent of the approach Apple is now taking.\u201cRunning any kind of business, having predictability in terms of your operating costs can be very important,\u201d said Gary Demasi, director of operations for data center energy and location strategy at Google, which has been a leading investor in and user of clean energy. \u201cRenewable energy, from a cost perspective, is now competitive with other forms of energy, much more so than it was a few years ago.\u201dExecutives face greater pressure from shareholders and customers to show that they are doing their part to fight climate change. At the same time, corporate energy use has exploded, driven in many cases by the ravenous demands of the data cloud.\u201cWe are all becoming very large energy players, and this is a shift,\u201d said Brian Janous, director of energy strategy at Microsoft. \u201cEnergy is not something that Microsoft or Amazon or Google really ever had to think much about prior to the advent of the cloud.\u201dElectric utilities have begun to respond by creating products and services to meet the corporate demand for clean energy, said Letha Tawney, the World Resources Institute\u2019s director of utility innovation.One such product is a green tariff. It was pioneered in North Carolina by Duke Energy and is now under consideration in about a dozen states. It allows companies to designate that they are paying for a renewable energy supply.Another is a synthetic or virtual power purchase agreement, under which companies contract to buy the output of a clean power plant, as Apple is doing with California Flats.Although the companies say these arrangements mean they are running their businesses on renewable energy, in reality the clean power often does not flow directly to their facilities. They typically buy the renewable energy in amounts to match what they draw from the grid \u2014 a system of swaps that Ms. Jackson of Apple likened to using an A.T.M.\u201cThe dollar you deposit in the bank might not be the exact same bill that you get out,\u201d she said.Robert F. Shapiro, a partner at the law firm Chadbourne & Parke who focuses on project finance and energy, describes it as meaningful symbolism.\u201cThey\u2019re actually getting power from their local utility, which may be coal,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cBut they\u2019re deemed to have put into the world carbon-neutral energy, which they are deemed to have used for their load.\u201dTo keep track of the clean energy credits, power generators work with registries to issue numbered certificates.\u201cThe power flows into the grid. The electrons go where they go,\u201d Ms. Tawney said. \u201cBut because there\u2019s a renewable-energy certificate, no one else can claim the same zero-carbon benefit.\u201dSuch complexities are necessary, executives and clean energy advocates say, because it is not often feasible to install enough renewable-power generators at corporate sites to meet companies\u2019 full energy needs.Walmart, despite having installed solar panels, wind turbines and fuel cells at stores and distribution centers, can nonetheless meet only about a third of those operations\u2019 energy needs. So it also buys renewable energy from generators and utilities, said David Ozment, director of energy at Walmart stores.Procter & Gamble, another member of the energy buyers\u2019 alliance, has arranged to purchase all of the steam from a biomass generator under construction at a plant in Georgia where it makes Charmin toilet paper and Bounty paper towels, said Jack McAneny, the company\u2019s director of sustainability.But that was possible, he said, only because of the plant\u2019s location near a source of waste wood and pulp for fuel and the cooperation of P&G\u2019s partners. Among those partners are the local utility, Georgia Power, which will buy the electricity from the generator for its customers from Constellation, the company that developed and will own and operate the generator.At Apple, where the purchase or production of renewable energy has more than tripled since 2012, the company would prefer to not have to go to great lengths to ensure a clean energy supply, Ms. Jackson said. But the public energy grid is simply still too dependent on carbon-based fuels to make that possible.\u201cIf we had our preference, we\u2019d just be able to say, \u2018We want 100 percent green power everywhere we use power,\u2019\u201d Ms. Jackson said. \u201cThe best would be if we could run every one of our stores, every one of our data centers, every office complex, every building we have, on 100 percent renewable \u2014 and if we didn\u2019t have to spend a whole bunch of our time and energy figuring out how to get that done.\u201dAdvertisement"}

While Mr. Cook was technically truthful, he omitted some context and shifted the spotlight from the thrust of the European Commission\u2019s case: whether Apple took advantage of loopholes in Irish tax laws.The issue of how much money Apple pays in taxes is also a bit of a red herring. \u201cThis fight with the European Union is not about what the company has paid in taxes overall, but about how much it should pay,\u201d said Steven Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. \u201cTax systems are not a pay-what-you-want system.\u201d_________The European Union wants to crack down on the ways that companies minimize their tax bills in Europe, especially in Ireland. In the 1980s, Ireland began modeling itself after Bermuda, a well-known corporate tax haven, said Khadija Sharife, a forensic financial researcher and an editor at the African Network of Centers for Investigative Reporting. Ireland\u2019s corporate tax rate is 12.5 percent, compared with 35 percent in the United States.While Ireland is phasing out some corporation-friendly rules, \u201ccompanies will continue to come up with ways to pay less taxes in other countries until all countries across the world can agree on corporate tax rules,\u201d said Lisa De Simone, assistant professor of accounting at Stanford University.__________The rest of Apple\u2019s income that was not recognized and taxed in Ireland could be put in other corporate structures that were effectively stateless. That meant the money in those structures was not taxable anywhere \u2014 not even in Ireland \u2014 and thus not subject to Ireland\u2019s 12.5 percent tax rate.While other companies have also had the right to negotiate with Ireland, the commission considers these sorts of loopholes a no-no.\u201cIn the U.S., states can fall all over themselves to offer subsidies and loopholes, but that is exactly what is illegal in Europe,\u201d said Edward D. Kleinbard, professor at the Gould School of Law at the University of Southern California and a former chief of staff to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.____________________While the E.U. has been trying to create harmony across the region when it comes to how to treat corporate taxes, for now taxes are \u201can issue for each individual member state in Europe,\u201d said Dr. Liza Lovdahl Gormsen with the British Institute of International and Comparative Law. She said this case creates uncertainty for many multinational companies across Europe.__________But Ms. De Simone said Apple has also kept more than $200 billion in accumulated profits offshore. That money could someday be brought home and taxed, but Apple is in control of whether or not that actually happens.__________But Mr. Rosenthal said the issue is ultimately broader than Europe. People would do well to also remember the total amount of government revenue being lost to low-cost tax deals, he said.\u201cIf we allow companies like Apple to pick its tax haven \u2014 to place a few thousand employees in a place for a lower tax rate \u2014 we do add a few jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cBut more widely, the taxes given up globally could be used for public service, worker training and infrastructure repair.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The amount is anticipated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars, one of these people said.The decision is set to further stoke tensions between American officials and their European counterparts, with Europe claiming the right to oversee tax policies for companies like Apple and Amazon, among others, that have used complicated tax structures in nations like Ireland and Luxembourg to reduce the amount of corporate tax they pay in other countries.\u201cThis will be framed by the U.S. as Europe overreaching,\u201d said Edward Kleinbard, a professor at the University of Southern California\u2019s Gould School of Law and a former chief of staff to the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. \u201cThat overreaction will make it a lot more difficult to police companies\u2019 international tax structures.\u201dApple, Irish authorities and European competition authorities declined to comment. The tax decision was earlier reported by RTE, the Irish broadcaster.Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s top antitrust official, is expected to say on Tuesday that the Irish government gave Apple preferential treatment on its local tax arrangements. These deals, related to agreements from 1991 and 2007, gave Apple an unfair advantage over other companies, and broke Europe\u2019s so-called state-aid rules that forbid any government from providing unfair assistance to certain companies over others, she is expected to say.Ireland can appeal any judgment by suing in the Court of Justice of the European Union to stop any resulting penalty, and Apple could seek to support such an appeal. Such appeals are likely to take years.For Apple, the potential tax clawback would be a blow to the company\u2019s approximately 30 years of activity in Ireland, where it currently employs around 5,500 people, mostly in Cork, a city in the south of the country.The tech giant has repeatedly denied that it received unfair tax treatment from Irish authorities, saying that it complies with all tax laws wherever it operates. While Apple has a large operation in Ireland, the company said its main corporate tax liabilities remain within the United States where it is based and conducts the majority of its research and development.The European Commission has been seeking a greater say over tax issues for decades. Those efforts accelerated after the 2008 financial crisis amid complaints that prosperous corporations were enjoying tax breaks while citizens faced mounting tax demands and cuts to their public services.Ms. Vestager has already ordered Luxembourg to claw back 30 million euros, or $33 million, from Fiat, the Italian carmaker, and the Netherlands to recover a similar amount from Starbucks. Both Luxembourg and the Netherlands have appealed those decisions. She still is investigating similar cases in Luxembourg affecting Amazon and McDonald\u2019s.Last year, in another case, Ms. Vestager ordered France to recover \u20ac1.4 billion, or $1.6 billion, from state-controlled \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France for failing to pay enough corporation tax in 1997. At the time, E.D.F. said it would make the reimbursement but was considering an appeal to the Court of Justice of the European Union.\u201cOur aim is very simple,\u201d Ms. Vestager said in an interview earlier this year. \u201cProfits should be taxed where profits are made.\u201dThe European Union\u2019s investigation into the Irish treatment of Apple began under Ms. Vestager\u2019s predecessor, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia. It was prompted in part by a United States Senate investigation in 2013 that found that Apple, the world\u2019s largest public company by market capitalization, sheltered tens of billions of dollars in profit from tax in offshore entities including in Ireland. The European Commission opened a formal investigation in June 2014 into whether the tax deals granted to Apple in Ireland amounted to illegal state support.Ireland strongly objected to the investigation. The ruling is likely to be a hard pill to swallow for the country, which has spent decades championing its low corporate tax rate and other tax breaks to entice American companies to its shores.The Irish government has said that it will appeal any tax decision announced by European officials, putting the country in the somewhat odd position of turning down potentially billions of dollars of extra revenue from Apple.\u201cThe decision by the Irish government to fight this case is bizarre,\u201d said James Stewart, a professor at Trinity College, Dublin. \u201cThe Irish government is opposed to any global tax harmonization because it will harm its ability to attract foreign direct investment.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It wants the Alexa Voice Service, which powers Echo, to be an ingredient in devices around the home and beyond, even if they aren\u2019t made by Amazon.The vision of an omnipresent intelligent assistant is one Amazon shares, in one form or another, with most other big technology companies, including Apple, Google and Microsoft. Along with a handful of start-ups, these companies see their intelligent assistants as powerful new ways for users to interact with devices and internet services \u2014 just as smartphone touch screens were.Many technology specialists think that people will be O.K. with a single intelligent assistant in their lives but that most won\u2019t have the patience to regularly use two or three of them, each with its individual quirks. As a result, each company is racing to weave its assistant into as many devices and services as possible.\u201cWe\u2019re taking $180 worth of utility and adding it into a $200 device,\u201d he said.Ford Motor is working with Amazon to integrate Alexa into its vehicles so drivers can control smart-home features like lights, thermostats and security systems from their cars.Over 10,000 developers have registered to integrate Alexa into their products, Amazon said. It won\u2019t say how many Echo units it has sold, except to say that millions of devices with Alexa in them have been purchased.In an interview this spring, David Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for devices, said that the company wanted there to be as many Alexa-linked \u201cendpoints\u201d around the home as possible and that Amazon did not really care who made those devices. Amazon has expanded its lineup of devices that use Alexa with its Echo Dot, a miniature version of the Echo speaker, and Amazon Tap, a portable Bluetooth speaker.\u201cThe longer-term vision is a little bit like the \u2018Star Trek\u2019 computer,\u201d Mr. Limp said. \u201cCaptain Kirk or Picard could sit on the bridge and ask anything and get the right answer.\u201dBut while Amazon has made a lot of progress in this regard, it may have a hard time extending Alexa\u2019s reach outside the home because of its weaknesses in mobile technology, analysts say.The success of Echo has been described as a redemption of sorts for Amazon after it suffered a brutal defeat in the smartphone market with its Fire Phone, which the company stopped selling after poor sales \u2014 a misstep that has left Amazon vulnerable.Apple and Google have clear advantages over Amazon because of their dominant positions in the mobile market. And they are pushing their versions of Alexa \u2014 Siri and Google\u2019s assistant \u2014 as ways to control other devices throughout the home.As intelligent assistants improve in quality, Jan Dawson, an analyst at Jackdaw Research, thinks people will want these virtual helpers to follow them all day like a companion. \u201cWhat you want from an assistant is that they are always available to you everywhere,\u201d he said.While Amazon could eventually give people access to Alexa\u2019s functions through apps on smartphones (a couple of apps from independent developers do this already), Mr. Dawson is skeptical that Amazon will be able to make them work as well as assistants more deeply integrated into smartphones by Apple and Google.\u201cThey\u2019re basically absent on smartphones, which are devices we take everywhere we go,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Cue Questlove.", "Date": "2016-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast fall, Questlove, of the Roots, visited Pandora Media\u2019s headquarters in Oakland, Calif., for what he assumed would be a perfunctory outreach meeting. Pandora, the internet radio giant, was one of several digital music outlets then trying to curry favor with him, Questlove said.\u201cI went in there to talk about playlists, and I ended up with a job as an equity partner,\u201d Questlove, whose real name is Ahmir Thompson, said in an interview.For Pandora, which has clashed with the music industry in the past, the involvement of an authority like Questlove \u2014 whose group is the house band on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d \u2014 is an important endorsement as the company embarks on its biggest challenge yet: expanding its service beyond radio to compete directly with Spotify, Apple Music and Tidal.\u201cWe are entering into a new phase for the company,\u201d Mr. Westergren said. \u201cWe are working more directly with labels and artists. We really want to invest a lot in that nexus, and having someone like him bridge that and speak on our behalf is really powerful.\u201dPandora, which began in 2005 and went public in 2011, has long been the most popular internet radio service, and it is one of a handful of digital music brands that have become household names. But its growth has slowed as it has faced more pressure from streaming competitors. Pandora\u2019s number of average monthly listeners reached its peak at the end of 2014, at 81.5 million.\u201cPandora is in a difficult chapter,\u201d said Mark Mulligan, a digital media analyst with Midia Research. \u201cWall Street doesn\u2019t like mature growth stories in young tech companies. It expects to see a dynamic growth and expansion story.\u201d\u201cThis is a commitment deeper than any girlfriend I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d he said, \u201cor any diet I\u2019ve tried to stick to.\u201dThe other side of Questlove\u2019s involvement with Pandora is his role as ambassador, which will include evangelizing for the service among fellow artists. In its earlier days, Pandora stayed largely independent of the music industry, relying on statutory licensing processes rather than dealing with record labels, which has sometimes resulted in ill will over royalties. Last year, Pandora reported that it paid $610 million, or about 52 percent of its revenue, in royalties and related costs.These days, Pandora is eager to promote the marketing platforms it makes available to artists, such as audio messages that can be delivered to fans and detailed data about the popularity of particular songs. When asked, Questlove said he initially had some hesitation about working with Pandora given its past conflicts with music world, but said he was confident that the company paid its royalty obligations properly and that part of his job would be to speak up for musicians in the company.Mr. Westergren said he was \u201cvery open to a candid assessment of how artists think about it.\u201dQuestlove said he was most excited about the possibilities of producing a radio show that would open listeners\u2019 eyes to more than just the biggest and most heavily promoted pop. That plan, he said, was clear from when Pandora first asked what his dream radio show would be.\u201cI want a world in which Drake\u2019s \u2018One Dance\u2019 can also live with Frank Zappa\u2019s \u2018Uncle Meat\u2019 can live with James Brown\u2019s \u2018Talkin\u2019 Loud and Sayin\u2019 Nothing,\u2019\u201d Questlove said, \u201cand all stops in between.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Will Pay a \u2018Bug Bounty\u2019 to Hackers Who Report Flaws", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "Supported byLAS VEGAS \u2014 Apple, which has been criticized in recent years for failing to pay outside hackers who report bugs in its products, said on Thursday that it would begin offering a so-called bug bounty to technologists who alert the company to flaws.At the Black Hat hacking conference, Apple announced a list of vulnerabilities that would command big bounties, including $25,000 for ways around Apple\u2019s digital compartments and into its customers\u2019 data, $50,000 for bugs that give hackers a way into iCloud data, and $200,000 to turn over critical vulnerabilities in Apple\u2019s firmware \u2014 the software that lies closest to the bare metal of the machine.Apple said that if hackers donated their rewards to charity, it would match their donation. \u201cWe want to reward the people, and frankly the creativity it takes to find bugs in these categories,\u201d said Ivan Krstic, Apple\u2019s head of security engineering and architecture.For six years, nearly every company in Silicon Valley has been rewarding hackers who turn over bugs \u2014 a term for flaws that can make a product vulnerable to intrusion \u2014 in their systems, with cash. The hope is that the money will be an incentive to keep those flaws out of the hands of organized groups or spy agencies willing to pay big money to learn about them.But Apple had stayed away from the practice. Instead, it had credited anyone who turned over bugs by putting their names on its website \u2014 a far cry from the tens of thousands of dollars, and in some cases hundreds of thousands of dollars, companies like Google and Facebook were willing to pay.The annual Black Hat conference, now in its 19th year, is a gathering place for all sorts of experts on computer security, including hackers, tech industry executives and government officials.Dan Kaminsky, a respected security researcher, said in a keynote speech that the industry was falling far short of expectations. The onslaught of regular, high-profile hacks, like the recent penetration of computers run by the Democratic National Committee, is beginning to make customers believe that little can be done to protect them.\u201cWe made promises in technology, and people are starting not to believe them\u201d Mr. Kaminsky told the audience. \u201cEverybody looks busy but the house still burns.\u201d Mr. Kaminsky argued for a cybersecurity equivalent of the National Institutes of Health or a Manhattan Project to fund research.Notably, a fund-raiser for Hillary Clinton coincided with this year\u2019s conference. Tickets for the \u201cHackers for Hillary\u201d fund-raiser were going for anywhere from $100 to $2,700.

{"Headline": "Google Duo Makes Video Calling Between Operating Systems Easier", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixGoogle and Apple have battled each other for years for primacy over mobile users. Apple has proferred its superior devices, like the iPhone. Google has fought back with its Android operating system and a series of mobile apps that are more flexible and compatible with a broader set of devices than Apple\u2019s apps.The app fits squarely into Google\u2019s playbook in mobile. Over the last few years, Google has increasingly offered its important software and internet services, including Google Maps, Google Photos and Google Docs, to iPhone customers. All of those apps were compelling alternatives to Apple\u2019s proprietary apps, like Apple Maps, Photos and Notes, because they work on a wider variety of devices, including Macs, Windows PCs, Android devices and iPhones.Duo is no exception. People can only use FaceTime to call others who have Apple devices. But Duo lets you place video calls between Android and iPhone users, and sizably increases the universe of people with whom you can hold a video conversation.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to worry about whether your call will connect, or if your friend is using the same type of device as you are,\u201d Google said in a statement, in a veiled jab at Apple. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder that nearly half of U.S. adults never make video calls on mobile.\u201dAll of this feeds into Google\u2019s strategy to attract iPhone users over to Android. Google\u2019s apps generally work better on Android devices than on iPhones, so the more that people get hooked on Google\u2019s core apps, the less incentive there is to stay loyal to Apple.Nick Fox, Google\u2019s head of communication products, said the top priority with Duo was to build a great product and to increase the use of video calling among Android users. But he added that making Android more attractive to iPhone owners was a secondary motive. He said that Duo\u2019s appeal was that it was simple to use, fast and more widely accessible.\u201cOur view is video calling should work for everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can only call half the people you know, that\u2019s very limiting.\u201d\u201cOur year-to-date iPhone sales to switchers are the greatest we\u2019ve seen in any nine-month period,\u201d Mr. Cook said in the call, without disclosing precise figures.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment beyond Mr. Cook\u2019s comments.I decided to test Duo to see how the new app plays into the debate about whether iPhone users should consider switching to Android devices. After trying an early copy of Duo and comparing it side by side with FaceTime, I found that Duo was just as intuitive and fun to use as FaceTime, but that it was too early to tell which service was more reliable.A Short HistoryThis is not the first time Google has provided video calling. Google started offering mobile video calling several years ago inside its Hangouts app, which also includes messaging and voice-calling capabilities. The video-calling feature in Hangouts will remain intact.Crystal Dahlen, a Google spokeswoman, said the name Duo conveyed that the app was designed for one-to-one video calling on mobile devices, in contrast to Hangouts, which lets groups of people make video calls over mobile devices and computers. Duo will roll out globally over the next few days.FaceTime, in contrast, is now six years old. When Apple unveiled the video-calling ability in iPhones in 2010, Steven P. Jobs, Apple\u2019s co-founder, said he had dreamed of mobile video calling since he grew up watching \u201cThe Jetsons\u201d and \u201cStar Trek.\u201d Apple later expanded FaceTime to work with iPads and Macs, among other Apple products. The company has not published statistics on FaceTime use, but the technology helped make mobile video calling mainstream.Duo Versus FaceTimeThe Duo app is downloadable and free through Google\u2019s Play store and Apple\u2019s App Store. When you open the Duo app, there is just one button: video call. Tapping that loads your contacts list, and from there you can choose whom to call.Duo starts streaming video to a recipient as soon as the call is placed, meaning the person you are calling will be able to see you waving or making faces before he or she picks up. Google calls this feature Knock Knock. It can be disabled in case you have friends who are likely to make inappropriate hand gestures.With FaceTime, you place a call directly through the iPhone\u2019s contacts list or through the separate FaceTime app. The recipient does not see the video streaming until after the call is answered.I placed video calls over Duo and FaceTime over a strong Wi-Fi connection as well as a weak cellular connection. In the tests, the video calls looked clearer on Duo, though that is an unreliable measure because very few people are currently able to use Duo, so the network is unrealistically uncongested. When more people use Duo, we can expect the picture quality to vary depending on network traffic and internet speeds.There is a minor difference for Duo between Android and iPhone users. An Android user receiving a Duo call will see a Knock Knock video on the home screen by default. Those using Apple devices will see a notification on top of the screen and will have to open the Duo app before seeing Knock Knock in action. Otherwise, the app works the same for both Android and iPhone.Against the RestI also compared Duo calls with video calls placed over Microsoft\u2019s Skype and Facebook Messenger. Against those two, Duo\u2019s simplicity won hands down.In Facebook\u2019s Messenger app, the video-calling feature is embedded in the corner of a message box, so it is hard to find and not intuitive to use. In fact, every call I have ever made with Messenger has been by mistake.On Skype, the video-calling feature is in a place similar to Messenger\u2019s, in the corner of a message box. More annoyingly, to find other Skype users you have to manually add them to your Skype contacts list or toggle on an option to synchronize your address book with Skype.The Bottom LineFor now, FaceTime is just as intuitive as Duo so I see no compelling reason to use Duo over FaceTime to call iPhone users.But if I had to video call an Android user, I would use Duo over other video-calling services like Skype or Facebook Messenger, which have more cluttered interfaces than Duo\u2019s single-button approach.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Frank Ocean\u2019s \u2018Blonde\u2019 Amplifies Discord in the Music Business", "Date": "2016-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the release of the album last weekend, through an exclusive deal with Apple, has also roiled the industry, bringing to the surface long-simmering tensions that record companies have with streaming music services, and sometimes even with their own artists.At the same time, Universal\u2019s management decided to clamp down on the growing practice of releasing new music through exclusive deals with digital outlets like Apple Music and Tidal, a move that reasserted the label\u2019s control over the music its artists produce but also risked alienating top performers who benefit from such promotions.As the industry has struggled to interpret the fallout from \u201cBlonde,\u201d one thing is clear: In the streaming age, the complex series of relationships that the music business relies on to function have become anything but harmonious.\u201cThe unprecedented run of exclusives by digital music services has put a tremendous strain on the relationship between artists and their record companies,\u201d said Larry Miller, an associate professor of music business at New York University\u2019s Steinhardt School. \u201cWe are seeing that play out in public now.\u201dThe details of Mr. Ocean\u2019s exit from Def Jam are still unclear. But the story began to take shape when fans noticed that the label\u2019s name was nowhere to be found in the credits for \u201cBlonde.\u201d That album had come out just a day after the release of Mr. Ocean\u2019s \u201cEndless,\u201d a 46-minute \u201cvisual album,\u201d also an Apple Music exclusive.Despite its idiosyncratic format, \u201cEndless\u201d \u2014 one long streaming film, whose songs (different from those on \u201cBlonde\u201d) were not available separately \u2014 fulfilled Mr. Ocean\u2019s contractual obligations to Def Jam, enabling him to release \u201cBlonde\u201d through Apple without any involvement from the label, according to three people with knowledge of Mr. Ocean\u2019s deal who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly. The financial arrangement between Mr. Ocean and Apple is not known. Apple, Def Jam and a representative for Mr. Ocean\u2019s managers all declined to comment.It was still not known whether a CD version of \u201cBlonde\u201d would be made widely available, and if so, what company would handle its distribution now that Mr. Ocean is no longer on the Def Jam roster. (In another twist to the unusual release of \u201cBlonde,\u201d a relatively small number of CDs were included with copies of a printed publication called Boys Don\u2019t Cry that were given away for a limited time in pop-up stores in New York and three other cities.)It follows a year of deal-making by streaming music companies like Apple and Tidal focused on exclusive album releases. Used by the streaming outlets to attract attention and subscribers, these arrangements \u2014 in which an album is available on only one service for a limited period, usually a week or two \u2014 have also been viewed by artists as ways to finance new projects, since they often involve a significant financial commitment from the streaming service to pay for videos or other forms of promotion, according to music and talent executives who have negotiated the deals.Over the last year, major albums by Beyonc\u00e9, Drake, Kanye West, Dr. Dre, Rihanna, Future and DJ Khaled were released first through exclusive streaming deals of various kinds. Apple has carved out a particular role in paying for videos by stars like Drake, the Weeknd and Taylor Swift.But deals like these have also often irritated fans, since they sequester music on a particular subscription-based service \u2014 even if only for a limited time. Record labels also often dislike them because they limit sales and frequently lead to piracy.They are also seen as examples of digital services interfering in the labels\u2019 relationships with artists, a connection that in decades past was absolute but has already been chipped away by declining record sales and the rise of the concert business as a major source of revenue for artists.The tide may be turning against exclusives, at least from the perspective of the labels. After the release of Mr. Ocean\u2019s album, Lucian Grainge, the chairman of Universal Music Group, sent a private memo to top executives at the company\u2019s labels calling for an end to long-term exclusive deals with a single service, according to a person who has seen the memo but spoke on the condition of anonymity because it was an internal document. Yet that edict may still leave the company plenty of room to negotiate more limited deals with digital services. A spokesman for Universal declined to comment.Executives at two major record labels said that in recent weeks Spotify, which has resisted exclusives, had told them that it had instituted a policy that music that had benefited from such deals on other services would not receive the same level of promotion once it arrived on Spotify; such music may not be as prominently featured or included in as many playlists, said these executives, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss private negotiations. Spotify declined to comment.Others in the music world have called for a truce between labels and digital services when it comes to online distribution, particularly when it concerns young artists like Mr. Ocean, who at 28 has no experience with the record industry before its digital disruption.\u201cArtists want to be fully empowered to control their careers, and they don\u2019t want the old school to tell them what to do,\u201d said Doug Davis, a music industry lawyer. \u201cUltimately there has to be a resolution between the major labels and the artists that allows them to control their destinies and cash in on the financial opportunities that are out there.\u201dBecause of an editing error, a picture caption on Friday with an article about a rift in the music industry that was brought to light by the release of Frank Ocean\u2019s new album \u201cBlonde\u201d misidentified the source of one music video image in some copies. The image, of Frank Ocean sitting next to a car with a drink in his hand, is from the video \u201cNikes,\u201d not from the album \u201cEndless.\u201dAdvertisement"}

There are promises to register with local law enforcement, to complete therapy if it is required and to not pick up hitchhikers or visit schools or playgrounds.And at the end there is a new entry: no Pok\u00e9mon Go.\u201cI understand that I shall not download, access, or otherwise engage in any internet-enabled gaming activities to include Pok\u00e9mon Go,\u201d it reads.The appearance of the popular smartphone game \u2014 in which players catch Pok\u00e9mon, digital creatures with names such as Squirtle and Jigglypuff \u2014 on the gloomy bureaucratic document was not a joke or a prank. It was a serious policy enacted by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, this month to protect children who play games over the internet.But advocates for civil liberties said they were skeptical of whether the new stipulation, which would apply to about 3,000 paroled sex offenders in the state, was appropriate.Pok\u00e9mon Go takes the form of a treasure hunt, with a digital map on a cellphone leading a player to real locations \u2014 many of them landmarks \u2014 to try to collect Pok\u00e9mon characters. The augmented reality game splices a digital layer onto the physical world: Pok\u00e9mon appear based on a player\u2019s physical location, and the cartoon creatures are seen through the phone\u2019s camera, creating an image that melds the virtual to the real \u2014 a smiley Bulbasaur near a Central Park fountain, for example.But to State Senators Jeffrey D. Klein and Diane J. Savino, both Democrats, it presented \u201ca virtual road map to our children,\u201d Mr. Klein said in a news release. In an informal investigation, they looked at 100 addresses of registered sex offenders across New York City and found Pok\u00e9mon near 57 of them. And they highlighted an instance in Indiana in which a sex offender was reportedly caught playing the game with a 16-year-old.Mr. Cuomo, in a statement explaining that the order was inspired by the investigation, said, \u201cThese actions will provide safeguards\u201d and \u201chelp take one more tool away from those seeking to do harm to our children.\u201dMr. Cuomo\u2019s office said that the game\u2019s \u201clure\u201d feature, which allows players to attract more Pok\u00e9mon to certain locations, \u201cappears to have the potential to be abused by predators.\u201dStill, Alphonso David, the governor\u2019s chief counsel, said, \u201cWhat we can\u2019t do is suggest that a percentage of children \u2014 even if it\u2019s a small percentage of children \u2014 can\u2019t be protected.\u201dThe list of so-called special conditions to which Pok\u00e9mon Go was added includes prohibitions on parolees owning cameras or cellphones, using the internet or driving anywhere besides work.

{"Headline": "Under Pressure, Big Banks Vie for Instant Payment Market", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn this digital age when almost anything can be had in an instant, the movement of money can seem glaringly slow.Most people paying a housekeeper or collecting money for an office pool still use cash or a check, which can take days to go through \u2014 a relative eternity that banking regulators worry is impeding commerce and economic growth.The slowness has led many Americans to new mobile services, like PayPal\u2019s Venmo or Square Cash, which make it possible to pay a friend instantly with just a phone.Now, the banks are catching up. On Monday, Wells Fargo joined JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and US Bank in allowing customers to send money in seconds to one another\u2019s bank accounts using just a phone number or email address. Customers of the biggest banks can now use their mobile phones, say, to send money instantly to a child in college who needs cash.\u201cWe pay attention to what customers are asking for, and we are doing all the things we need to stay competitive,\u2019\u2019 said Brett Pitts, who leads digital initiatives at Wells Fargo.The stakes are high: Banks are under broad pressure both from the Federal Reserve, which has a \u201cfaster payments committee\u201d aimed at requiring immediate improvements, and from tech companies like PayPal and Apple, whose Apple Pay service was a bright spot in its recent earnings report.All these companies, and Visa and MasterCard, are competing to build and control the payment network of the future.Banks are promoting their new services as cool and convenient: One Chase advertisement shows the basketball star Stephen Curry dribbling a basketball while making an instant payment on his phone.American bank executives fear that they could lose ground to plucky payment companies like Venmo, a popular choice among millennials who want to pay each other \u2014 and send emoji-filled messages to their friends.The banks worry that if they do not respond with their own instant payment offerings, they will be relegated to performing less-profitable back-office functions for hip new payment companies, which make their money primarily by charging small fees to customers who pay by credit card rather than directly from a bank account.The person-to-person payment market is valuable because it allows financial companies to gain the first point of contact with a consumer and then try to sell them other products like loans.Analysts predict that eventually the new payments network could be extended to connect consumers with merchants, providing a potentially lucrative source of fees for banks.\u201cIt\u2019s like owning a toll road: You are going to get paid by everybody that uses it,\u201d said Gareth Lodge, a payments analyst at Celent, a financial consulting firm.Mastercard and Visa, which have a tight grip on payments made with credit and debit cards, are also trying to gain a foothold in these new networks.Late last month, Mastercard acquired a majority stake in VocaLink, the company that operates a mobile and internet payment network in the United Kingdom and is helping to develop an even broader system in the United States. Also, Visa recently announced a broad partnership with PayPal that will make both of their offerings more instantaneous.Instant person-to-person payment is something that people in many other countries have been able to do for years, and the absence of the service in the United States has been a marker of the relative backwardness of American banks.The banks began developing the system being introduced this year in 2011, when Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo created a network called clearXchange. That system has already allowed bank customers to send each other money using just an email address or cellphone number, but transactions were not instant until this year.In addition to payments technology that the nation\u2019s largest banks are rolling out this summer, banks that belong to an industry group called the Clearing House are developing a broader network that will allow businesses and even governments to make large instant payments.A fast and efficient payment network also has implications for the economy. Federal officials and analysts say the current lag time between when a payment is sent and when the money is cleared to spend can hinder businesses from balancing their books and managing their supplies. The lag also puts the United States at a disadvantage compared with, say, Europe, where banks are far ahead in making payments instantaneous.The banks now face a challenge to make their real-time technology easy enough to lure customers away from start-ups like Venmo.With Venmo, a user can send money to anyone simply by tapping into the app and entering a phone number or email address. By contrast, customers of JPMorgan Chase, for example, must log into their Chase app using their password, then navigate through a series of somewhat clunky tabs to initiate a transaction with QuickPay. The banks also lack the social networking capabilities that have helped make Venmo a hit.Talie Baker, a payments analyst at the Aite Group, a banking consultancy, said that even her friends who have Chase\u2019s service often do not think it is worth using. \u201cI can\u2019t get anybody to accept a Chase QuickPay payment from me,\u201d she said. \u201cBanks are probably going to start losing market share if they don\u2019t make their applications as easy to use as Venmo is.\u201dChase and the other banks say the additional steps they ask of customers provide more security. The banks also say they are already handling significantly more personal payments than Venmo and other competitors like Square Cash.Chase said that last year it processed about $20 billion in so-called peer-to-peer payments, while Venmo handled about $10 billion. PayPal as a whole made about $40 billion in such payments, the company said.The banks should have a significant advantage over technology companies, given the sheer number of customers they already have, payment industry analysts say.PayPal and the banks say the most immediate opportunity is not taking business from one another, but cannibalizing the enormous number of payments that are still made by cash and check, which represent more than three-quarters of all peer-to-peer transactions.Bill Ready, who oversees Venmo at PayPal, said he was happy that American banks were finally catching up with the progress that has been made in most other developed countries.\u201cThe rest of the world has already been here a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cTo see an industry move is a great thing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The less he drives, the more he potentially makes.Registering his vehicle on the peer-to-peer car rental company Getaround, Mr. Rogers, who lives in San Francisco, rents out his Toyota Prius by the hour or the day, whenever he does not need it. In the last six months, he has earned an average of $750 a month for essentially doing nothing but acting as his own rent-a-car company.\u201cMy friends and family back in Texas think I\u2019m crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been really surprised by how much money I\u2019ve made.\u2019\u2019Mr. Rogers, whose day job also involves disruptive transportation technology, is an account operations manager for Lyft, the ride-hailing competitor to Uber.Getaround joins companies like Lyft and Uber \u2014 and for that matter, Airbnb \u2014 that enable owners and customers to make use of valuable assets that might otherwise sit idle much of the time.And it is but one example of how smartphone-based technology continues to upend the traditional car rental business, which was long dominated by Avis, Enterprise, Hertz and their various subsidiaries.The conventional car rental companies, which a decade ago had to respond to the rise of digital fleet-rental alternatives like Zipcar \u2014 which Avis ended up buying \u2014 have had little choice but to continue evolving to adapt to smartphone upstarts like Getaround.\u201cFor us, technology is key,\u201d said Sam Zaid, Getaround\u2019s chief executive. \u201cOur technology makes car rental as easy as owning a car.\u201dOperating in 10 cities in the United States, Getaround has signed up about 3,000 car owners. Each owner agrees to let Getaround install a small box under the car\u2019s dashboard, which tracks vehicle diagnostics, pinpoints the car\u2019s location at any moment and keeps track of how the vehicle is being driven. Getaround charges owners $20 a month, and a 40 percent commission on rental fees.To rent a car, which costs $5 to $25 an hour depending on the model, a customer uses the Getaround app to find a nearby vehicle. A grid shows its location and whether and when the car is available. The customer can unlock the vehicle by smartphone, then find a car key that has been hidden within the vehicle.All rental forms are filled out electronically, with no need for the owner and customer to ever meet. The rental rate includes $1 million of insurance coverage, as well as roadside assistance.The Getaround model is meant for cities with concentrated populations, which is why its initial markets also include Portland, Ore., Chicago and Washington.For less densely settled, sprawling metropolises like Los Angeles, there are companies like Skurt, a one-year-old start-up, which will deliver rental cars to customers. After the drop-off, Skurt drivers head back to the office by public transportation, a folding bike or even a skateboard.Like Getaround, Skurt does not own the cars. The company contracts with the major rental companies to make use of their excess capacity. Using the Skurt app, customers choose the models they want, set the drop-off and pickup times and locations, and scan their driver\u2019s licenses. Prices start at about $40 a day.Skurt is aiming at the millennial market. And so, unlike traditional car rental companies, which usually add a surcharge for renters younger than 25, Skurt will rent to drivers as young as 21 at no additional charge.\u201cOur customers don\u2019t consider us as an alternative to car rental companies; they use us as a replacement for car ownership,\u201d said Josh Mangel, 23, one of Skurt\u2019s founders.Skurt\u2019s cars are available in the more heavily populated parts of Los Angeles and neighboring Orange County, with expansion planned soon to San Diego and Austin, Tex.Besides the considerable costs involved in big fleets of vehicles and large chains of airport and storefront retail offices, the conventional rental car companies are also encumbered by longstanding business procedures, which for customers can mean standing in a slow-moving line at a rental agency waiting for a paper rental contract to be issued.That is one reason that earlier this year, Hertz invested in customer convenience by taking a stake in Luxe, a San Francisco start-up that operates as a valet on demand, parking a car when the customer cannot find a space and then handing it back over again when the customer is ready. Although Luxe will park anyone\u2019s car, Hertz plans to make it a service option with some of its rental fleet.To make its valet service feasible, Luxe operates only in parts of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Los Angeles, San Francisco and several other cities. The company returns a car within 30 minutes of the customer\u2019s requesting it.Hertz plans to enhance Luxe\u2019s convenience by having employees pick up and deliver cars for customers who rent away from an airport, wherever they are.\u201cWe\u2019re on the precipice of very significant changes within the company,\u201d said Jeffrey Foland, a Hertz senior executive vice president. Over the next two years, the company will refresh its core technology, including its customer interface and reservations systems. \u201cWe want to make the rental process no more complicated than a couple of clicks on a mobile device.\u201dEnterprise, which also owns the Alamo and National brands, is betting that the best way to reduce the stress of a rental is keeping the customer away from the rental counter. It already operates Enterprise CarShare, a service similar to Zipcar.And now, using Enterprise\u2019s new LaunchPad software, available in 17 North American cities, a customer who has booked a reservation is greeted at the rental agency door by an employee holding a tablet. With LaunchPad, the Enterprise employee has real-time access to the locations of cars in the fleet. The employee uses a prefilled reservation and takes the customer directly to the car.During the car\u2019s inspection, any dings are photographed on the tablet through LaunchPad. When the vehicle is returned, the process is reversed, with a receipt emailed to the renter.\u201cWe\u2019re moving the process from a transaction to an interaction,\u201d said Scott Stephens, an Enterprise assistant vice president.Avis is taking a different approach. With its new Avis Now app, the company\u2019s preferred customers receive automatic notification of the location of their rental vehicle and a picture of it upon reaching the rental lot.Customers can use Avis Now to change cars while still in the lot, confirm fuel level and mileage and return the car without assistance. With Avis vehicles that have connected technology, the app also allows the renter to open the doors and flash the lights to make the car easier to find.Yet none of these advancements address the one basic fact about renting a car: Like borrowed evening wear, it may fit, but it is still not as comfortable as your own.Imagine one day jumping into your rental vehicle and finding your favorite radio stations, seat position and temperature all preconfigured, based on your digital profile. That is a goal that the rental companies say they are pursuing.\u201cThere\u2019s an aligned interest between the car manufacturers, Google, Apple and us,\u201d Mr. Foland of Hertz said. \u201cWe\u2019re working with these parties to have customized vehicles in the near future.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber to Sell to Rival Didi Chuxing and Create New Business in China", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Uber\u2019s future in China seemed to hold promise.The sale, which would create a new company worth about $35 billion, would end the great ride-hailing battle of China. A person with knowledge of the deal said Uber investors had been pushing for such a transaction.The companies have been fighting relentlessly for market share in mainland China for two years, spending tens of millions of dollars every month to attract riders and drivers. The merger would end that competition and create significant scale, but it would also be a repudiation of Uber\u2019s ambitions to take on local Chinese competitors in their huge home market.Uber had pushed its way into a country that has gone almost untouched by major American tech companies in recent years. Its progress was widely watched and discussed by entrepreneurs and investors alike as a model for how to reach China\u2019s 600 million internet users \u2014 a forbidding prospect considering the country\u2019s well-funded local competitors and regulations aimed at blocking foreign businesses.With the deal, the company will join the ranks of American peers like Google and eBay, which were unable to capitalize on early footholds in China. EBay was outmaneuvered by Alibaba, while Google left China after it said it was the target of government-sponsored cyberattacks.Still, it is by no means a financial catastrophe for Uber, which for about $2 billion of investment in the Chinese market gets a $7 billion share in a company that is likely to grow. It also saves the cash it may have spent competing in China for other projects.\u201cHowever, as an entrepreneur, I\u2019ve learned that being successful is about listening to your head as well as following your heart,\u201d he wrote. \u201cUber and Didi Chuxing are investing billions of dollars in China and both companies have yet to turn a profit there.\u201dUnder the terms of the deal, the new company\u2019s estimated worth is a combination of Didi Chuxing\u2019s $28 billion valuation and Uber China\u2019s $7 billion, according to two people with knowledge of the deal, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the information had not yet been made public. Uber shareholders would receive a 20 percent stake in the new company.Over the past two years, Uber upended expectations in China and its business there grew, despite heavy regulation and internet filters that often limit access to the products of foreign tech companies. The early 2015 rollout of People\u2019s Uber, a service that got ordinary Chinese drivers behind the wheel and taking passengers, helped Uber grab a chunk of market share from Didi.As it grew in China, Uber avoided many of the mistakes made by of its American tech forebears. For one, the company created local teams based around different cities, allowing it to respond quickly and flexibly to moves by the competition. That set it apart from other companies, which sought to control Chinese operations from the United States, slowing their responses.But entry is just the first obstacle to the Chinese internet market. Competition is fierce, and the focus is less on the product than on big spending to lure customers or on tricks to harm competitors. Fraudsters and opportunists also abound.Uber\u2019s engineers, operating from San Francisco, had to deal with drivers who simulated or faked rides to get commissions. At the same time, the company was blocked from marketing on China\u2019s biggest social network, WeChat, because the internet giant Tencent was an early investor in Didi. All of that made it much harder to compete with a company that already had an advantage in scale, not to mention the backing of Tencent, Alibaba and Apple. When it raised $7 billion in June, Didi made it clear it was willing to continue the fight for a long time.For all the publicity around the spat between Uber and Didi, the two had been in talks stretching back to the Didi-Kuaidi merger in the beginning of 2015, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. That person said the two sides could not overcome disagreements about valuations at the time.In another quirk to the latest deal, two members of the same well-known family in the world of technology were on opposite sides of the negotiating table: Didi\u2019s president, Jean Liu, is the daughter of Liu Chuanzhi, the Chinese founder of the largest computer maker in the world, Lenovo. Her cousin, Zhen Liu, is a vice president and regular spokeswoman for Uber China.Although the tie-up is expected to reassure investors, Chinese analysts said it would probably lead to a decrease in commissions. That could hurt customers and drivers alike, the analysts said, making it harder for smaller players to compete because their larger rival would no longer be saddled with such an expense.\u201cFor smaller companies like Yidao or Shenzhou, if they keep subsidizing users, it will only be temporary and will bring more financial burdens,\u201d said Hong Bo, an independent technology analyst in China.Li Bo, a 22-year-old driver from Henan, said the loyalty of drivers is determined by where they could get the best pay. That meant they would continue to follow the subsidies, he said.\u201cAll we care is who gives us the best deal,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Didi buys Uber, we just work for Didi. It doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201dPaul Mozur reported from Hong Kong, and Mike Isaac from San Francisco. Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting from New York.

{"Headline": "Apple, Congress and the Missing Taxes", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "Supported byEditorialApple and the United States are crying foul over the ruling in Europe that Apple received illegal tax breaks from Ireland and must hand over 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion), a record tax penalty in Europe.But Apple and the United States have only themselves to blame for the situation.Initially, deferral was a convenience for multinationals, as they sought investment opportunities abroad. Today, it is the taproot of global tax avoidance. Financial engineering has let American companies shift profits into foreign accounts, while they lobby Congress for tax-rate cuts in exchange for repatriating the money. Currently, there is some $2 trillion in corporate profits in offshore tax-deferred accounts; besides Apple, Microsoft, Google, Cisco and Oracle also have large stashes. Apple is one of nearly two dozen major corporations pushing Congress for a \u201ctax holiday,\u201d which would let companies bring back foreign-held money over the course of a year at a discounted tax rate, rather than the current rate, 35 percent.Before the European ruling on Tuesday, the debate over a tax holiday had pitted Republicans, who have generally favored the idea, against Democrats, who have viewed it as an unjustified reward for tax avoidance. The Democrats have history on their side. A tax holiday in 2005 lowered the corporate rate to 5.25 percent, enticing corporations to repatriate some $300 billion. It was billed as a way to create jobs and increase investment, but the money was used mostly for dividend payments, share buybacks (which tend to raise executive pay) and severance for laid-off employees. Worse, the tax holiday inspired multinationals to stash as much money abroad as they possibly could in anticipation of another holiday.The European ruling, however, could sharply alter the terms of the congressional debate. Republicans and Democrats alike have always assumed that foreign-held profits would one day be repatriated. The big question was the rate at which they would ultimately be taxed. Similarly, the Treasury assumes that deferred foreign profits will one day be taxed when it projects future revenues \u2014 an important measure of the nation\u2019s fiscal health.But the money won\u2019t be repatriated and taxed under American law if Europeans, in the course of enforcing their own laws against tax havens, get their hands on it first. And that, in a nutshell, is why members of Congress and Treasury officials are so upset about the Apple ruling. They understand, correctly, that tax-law enforcement in Europe could reduce the sums they expect to collect taxes on someday. What they don\u2019t understand, or aren\u2019t saying, is that they brought the problem on themselves.The way forward is not to declare a tax war with Europe. It is for Congress to agree on a way to tax foreign-held corporate profits. President Obama put forth a reasonable approach in 2015, when he proposed a mandatory 14 percent tax on multinationals\u2019 current offshore profits \u2014 whether they are repatriated or not \u2014 and, thereafter, a new minimum tax rate of 19 percent on profits moved offshore. An even better approach would be to simply end indefinite corporate tax deferral, imposing American taxes on profits when they are made.Republicans rejected Mr. Obama\u2019s proposal in 2015, and there is no chance that lawmakers will engage in such a debate so close to the election. But the next president and Congress will need to act to ensure that at long last, American corporations pay their fair share in taxes.Advertisement"}

The company contracts with the major rental companies to make use of their excess capacity. Using the Skurt app, customers choose the models they want, set the drop-off and pickup times and locations, and scan their driver\u2019s licenses. Prices start at about $40 a day.Skurt is aiming at the millennial market. And so, unlike traditional car rental companies, which usually add a surcharge for renters younger than 25, Skurt will rent to drivers as young as 21 at no additional charge.\u201cOur customers don\u2019t consider us as an alternative to car rental companies; they use us as a replacement for car ownership,\u201d said Josh Mangel, 23, one of Skurt\u2019s founders.Skurt\u2019s cars are available in the more heavily populated parts of Los Angeles and neighboring Orange County, with expansion planned soon to San Diego and Austin, Tex.Besides the considerable costs involved in big fleets of vehicles and large chains of airport and storefront retail offices, the conventional rental car companies are also encumbered by longstanding business procedures, which for customers can mean standing in a slow-moving line at a rental agency waiting for a paper rental contract to be issued.That is one reason that earlier this year, Hertz invested in customer convenience by taking a stake in Luxe, a San Francisco start-up that operates as a valet on demand, parking a car when the customer cannot find a space and then handing it back over again when the customer is ready. Although Luxe will park anyone\u2019s car, Hertz plans to make it a service option with some of its rental fleet.To make its valet service feasible, Luxe operates only in parts of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Los Angeles, San Francisco and several other cities. The company returns a car within 30 minutes of the customer\u2019s requesting it.Hertz plans to enhance Luxe\u2019s convenience by having employees pick up and deliver cars for customers who rent away from an airport, wherever they are.\u201cWe\u2019re on the precipice of very significant changes within the company,\u201d said Jeffrey Foland, a Hertz senior executive vice president. Over the next two years, the company will refresh its core technology, including its customer interface and reservations systems. \u201cWe want to make the rental process no more complicated than a couple of clicks on a mobile device.\u201dEnterprise, which also owns the Alamo and National brands, is betting that the best way to reduce the stress of a rental is keeping the customer away from the rental counter. It already operates Enterprise CarShare, a service similar to Zipcar.And now, using Enterprise\u2019s new LaunchPad software, available in 17 North American cities, a customer who has booked a reservation is greeted at the rental agency door by an employee holding a tablet. With LaunchPad, the Enterprise employee has real-time access to the locations of cars in the fleet. The employee uses a prefilled reservation and takes the customer directly to the car.During the car\u2019s inspection, any dings are photographed on the tablet through LaunchPad. When the vehicle is returned, the process is reversed, with a receipt emailed to the renter.\u201cWe\u2019re moving the process from a transaction to an interaction,\u201d said Scott Stephens, an Enterprise assistant vice president.Avis is taking a different approach. With its new Avis Now app, the company\u2019s preferred customers receive automatic notification of the location of their rental vehicle and a picture of it upon reaching the rental lot.Customers can use Avis Now to change cars while still in the lot, confirm fuel level and mileage and return the car without assistance. With Avis vehicles that have connected technology, the app also allows the renter to open the doors and flash the lights to make the car easier to find.Yet none of these advancements address the one basic fact about renting a car: Like borrowed evening wear, it may fit, but it is still not as comfortable as your own.Imagine one day jumping into your rental vehicle and finding your favorite radio stations, seat position and temperature all preconfigured, based on your digital profile. That is a goal that the rental companies say they are pursuing.\u201cThere\u2019s an aligned interest between the car manufacturers, Google, Apple and us,\u201d Mr. Foland of Hertz said. \u201cWe\u2019re working with these parties to have customized vehicles in the near future.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Giants Gobble Start-Ups in an Antitrust Blind Spot", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorLike Facebook\u2019s acquisition of WhatsApp, the Walmart deal will probably end up being another example of an upstart internet company being swallowed up to preserve the stranglehold of a giant.This happens because antitrust regulators are stuck in an outdated view of the world, while the internet giants are more attuned to their nascent competitive threats. The deal for Jet.com is just the latest defensive internet acquisition of an emerging start-up that will preserve the hegemony of a select few.And now it is being swallowed up by Walmart.This could be seen as a victory for competition. Walmart will now have a more dynamic management and brand to buttress its own internet sales operation, which trails Amazon by quite a distance. This will allow it to better compete against Amazon. The likely result is that competition in online retailing will eventually be a slugfest between Amazon and Walmart with everyone else thrown by the wayside.The problem with this narrative is that it cements the positions of Walmart and Amazon as the only players in town.This is the modus operandi of the big internet behemoths. They live in fear of new technology disrupting their businesses and killing them off.Mr. Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez was a Facebook product manager when the company faced its greatest threat: Google Plus. Facebook won because it enforced an ethos of all work, all the time, spurred by constant fear of extinction.Facebook and its elite brethren will do anything to make sure they are not the next Yahoo or Radio Shack, killed by disruption and failure to innovate. This translates into paying obscene sums for technology that might challenge their dominance one day.If you don\u2019t believe this, there is a poignant passage in \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d where Mr. Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez notes that Mark Zuckerberg saw that there were two companies with \u201chockey stick growth\u201d that matched Facebook\u2019s own: Instagram and WhatsApp. Both were amassing users at an amazing rate and both were an existential threat to Facebook.Did Mr. Zuckerberg rev up the Facebook machine to try to outcompete them? No. Instead, he bought Instagram for about $1 billion and WhatsApp for an astounding $21.8 billion.Today, Facebook is dominant, with more than 1.7 billion monthly active users. WhatsApp has more than 1 billion monthly active users and Instagram, more than 500 million.Another Google example is YouTube, which was bought for $1.65 billion in 2006 and is now a constant stream of users for Google. Indeed, YouTube, with more than one billion active monthly users, is a top driver of Alphabet\u2019s user growth.Billions of dollars are made in Silicon Valley by selling nascent upstarts to the giants. And the dominant players pay eagerly to remain dominant. That is what is going on with the Jet.com acquisition and perhaps even the $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn by Microsoft.Where are the antitrust authorities in all of this? The guiding standard under the law is that no acquisition should be allowed if it would \u201clessen competition.\u201dUnder the traditional view of antitrust, when Facebook, for example, tries to buy a company like Instagram, it can argue that anyone can start such a website. And there are other competitors like Google and Snapchat. And so this gets past the antitrust authorities, who seem more concerned with how the data will be used rather than the accumulation of users. Both United States and European Union regulators examined the WhatsApp deal, but it passed muster because WhatsApp was viewed as a messenger service, something where there was alternative competition.This misses the point that domination is all about users and views. Those companies with users and page views can dominate, and accumulating those users is everything, something only an infinitesimally small number of companies can find the key to doing.The antitrust system results in the increasing oligopoly that we have, where a few companies dominate major industries, accruing the wealth and power that go with it as potential disrupters are swallowed at birth, the way Cronus, the titan in Greek mythology, ate his young to prevent their uprising.No one knows what might happen to Jet if it remained independent. Perhaps it would fail. Amazon is dominant and Walmart may truly be the only real competitor. The same could be said of any of these acquisitions of high-growth companies. So preventing this acquisition may result not in creating a competitor to Amazon but in the eventual death of Jet. This of course would leave its founder and investors much poorer, a true cost.The flip side of this risk is that the big tech companies continue unchallenged in their dominance. Perhaps it is time to rethink antitrust enforcement, and take the risks associated with a different view of antitrust that looks at potential dominance and at breaking up oligopolies. Rhea protected Zeus from Cronus, which eventually led to Cronus\u2019s destruction.If antitrust authorities do not adapt and emerging competitors continue to be bought up, we should not be surprised of the continued dominance of a very few companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Walmart.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Under Pressure, Big Banks Vie for Instant Payment Market", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "Supported byIn this digital age when almost anything can be had in an instant, the movement of money can seem glaringly slow.Most people paying a housekeeper or collecting money for an office pool still use cash or a check, which can take days to go through \u2014 a relative eternity that banking regulators worry is impeding commerce and economic growth.The slowness has led many Americans to new mobile services, like PayPal\u2019s Venmo or Square Cash, which make it possible to pay a friend instantly with just a phone.Now, the banks are catching up. On Monday, Wells Fargo joined JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and US Bank in allowing customers to send money in seconds to one another\u2019s bank accounts using just a phone number or email address. Customers of the biggest banks can now use their mobile phones, say, to send money instantly to a child in college who needs cash.\u201cWe pay attention to what customers are asking for, and we are doing all the things we need to stay competitive,\u2019\u2019 said Brett Pitts, who leads digital initiatives at Wells Fargo.The stakes are high: Banks are under broad pressure both from the Federal Reserve, which has a \u201cfaster payments committee\u201d aimed at requiring immediate improvements, and from tech companies like PayPal and Apple, whose Apple Pay service was a bright spot in its recent earnings report.All these companies, and Visa and MasterCard, are competing to build and control the payment network of the future.Banks are promoting their new services as cool and convenient: One Chase advertisement shows the basketball star Stephen Curry dribbling a basketball while making an instant payment on his phone.American bank executives fear that they could lose ground to plucky payment companies like Venmo, a popular choice among millennials who want to pay each other \u2014 and send emoji-filled messages to their friends.The banks worry that if they do not respond with their own instant payment offerings, they will be relegated to performing less-profitable back-office functions for hip new payment companies, which make their money primarily by charging small fees to customers who pay by credit card rather than directly from a bank account.The person-to-person payment market is valuable because it allows financial companies to gain the first point of contact with a consumer and then try to sell them other products like loans.Analysts predict that eventually the new payments network could be extended to connect consumers with merchants, providing a potentially lucrative source of fees for banks.\u201cIt\u2019s like owning a toll road: You are going to get paid by everybody that uses it,\u201d said Gareth Lodge, a payments analyst at Celent, a financial consulting firm.Mastercard and Visa, which have a tight grip on payments made with credit and debit cards, are also trying to gain a foothold in these new networks.Late last month, Mastercard acquired a majority stake in VocaLink, the company that operates a mobile and internet payment network in the United Kingdom and is helping to develop an even broader system in the United States. Also, Visa recently announced a broad partnership with PayPal that will make both of their offerings more instantaneous.Instant person-to-person payment is something that people in many other countries have been able to do for years, and the absence of the service in the United States has been a marker of the relative backwardness of American banks.The banks began developing the system being introduced this year in 2011, when Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo created a network called clearXchange. That system has already allowed bank customers to send each other money using just an email address or cellphone number, but transactions were not instant until this year.In addition to payments technology that the nation\u2019s largest banks are rolling out this summer, banks that belong to an industry group called the Clearing House are developing a broader network that will allow businesses and even governments to make large instant payments.A fast and efficient payment network also has implications for the economy. Federal officials and analysts say the current lag time between when a payment is sent and when the money is cleared to spend can hinder businesses from balancing their books and managing their supplies. The lag also puts the United States at a disadvantage compared with, say, Europe, where banks are far ahead in making payments instantaneous.The banks now face a challenge to make their real-time technology easy enough to lure customers away from start-ups like Venmo.With Venmo, a user can send money to anyone simply by tapping into the app and entering a phone number or email address. By contrast, customers of JPMorgan Chase, for example, must log into their Chase app using their password, then navigate through a series of somewhat clunky tabs to initiate a transaction with QuickPay. The banks also lack the social networking capabilities that have helped make Venmo a hit.Talie Baker, a payments analyst at the Aite Group, a banking consultancy, said that even her friends who have Chase\u2019s service often do not think it is worth using. \u201cI can\u2019t get anybody to accept a Chase QuickPay payment from me,\u201d she said. \u201cBanks are probably going to start losing market share if they don\u2019t make their applications as easy to use as Venmo is.\u201dChase and the other banks say the additional steps they ask of customers provide more security. The banks also say they are already handling significantly more personal payments than Venmo and other competitors like Square Cash.Chase said that last year it processed about $20 billion in so-called peer-to-peer payments, while Venmo handled about $10 billion. PayPal as a whole made about $40 billion in such payments, the company said.The banks should have a significant advantage over technology companies, given the sheer number of customers they already have, payment industry analysts say.PayPal and the banks say the most immediate opportunity is not taking business from one another, but cannibalizing the enormous number of payments that are still made by cash and check, which represent more than three-quarters of all peer-to-peer transactions.Bill Ready, who oversees Venmo at PayPal, said he was happy that American banks were finally catching up with the progress that has been made in most other developed countries.\u201cThe rest of the world has already been here a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cTo see an industry move is a great thing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lyft Is Said to Seek a Buyer, Without Success", "Date": "2016-08-19", "News": "Supported byIt is not an easy thing to be an independent ride-hailing company these days.For one, it takes billions of dollars and hundreds of employees to spread to new cities, to market the service and to recruit drivers. Legislators and local laws are often not in your favor. And competitors with deep pockets from all over the world are waiting to cheer if you happen to fail.Lyft, the second-biggest ride-hailing company in the United States behind Uber, is grappling with those forces \u2014 but has found that its options are limited.The company, which is based in San Francisco, has in recent months held talks or made approaches to sell itself to companies including General Motors, Apple, Google, Amazon, Uber and Didi Chuxing, according to a dozen people who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. One person said it was Lyft who was approached by interested parties.Lyft\u2019s discussions were most serious with G.M., which is one of the ride-hailing company\u2019s largest investors. Still, G.M. never made a written offer to buy Lyft, said the people, and in the end, Lyft did not find a buyer.Lyft is not in danger of closing down and has a cash cushion of $1.4 billion, some of these people added, so the company will continue as an independent entity.Still, the talks underline how difficult it has become to operate in the ride-hailing market, where people can book rides from drivers through a smartphone app. While ride-hailing companies do not own fleets of cars and instead rely on drivers who have their own vehicles, the business is highly capital-intensive. Venture capitalists and other investors have poured billions of dollars into the companies.Lyft, a four-year-old company founded by Logan Green and John Zimmer, sprang out of an early long-distance car-pooling program, then called Zimride, in 2007. The goal, the two co-founders have said, was to create a new kind of social ride-sharing, an attempt to decrease the number of cars on the road and to improve congestion, reduce humanity\u2019s environmental footprint and create more efficiency in transportation.That idea has turned into a global movement, as companies worldwide \u2014 like Grab in Southeast Asia, Ola in India, BlaBlaCar in Europe and Uber \u2014 look to upend the global transportation infrastructure.The effort to sell Lyft was aided by bankers at Qatalyst Partners, the boutique investment bank founded by the veteran Silicon Valley banker Frank Quattrone, said the people with knowledge of the talks. Qatalyst declined to comment.Lyft also struggled to find a buyer because of the challenging economics of the ride-hailing business. Companies like Lyft and Uber typically take 20 percent to 25 percent of the cost of each ride. With Lyft drivers expected to pick up an estimated $2 billion or so in fares this year, that meant Lyft\u2019s annual revenue would be about $400 million, according to a person familiar with the company\u2019s financials.That $400 million shrinks after marketing costs are factored in. To win loyalty from drivers who can also work for Uber, Lyft also sometimes lets drivers keep that 20 percent to 25 percent of some rides, so the company effectively earns no revenue in those situations. And in some cases, Lyft provides drivers with additional cash incentives simply to get out on the road, adding to its costs.\u201cOne of the challenges for these companies is to figure out how to grow and sustain that latent demand for these businesses, but also to eventually become profitable,\u201d said Susan Shaheen, co-director of the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cPart of the challenge in evolving those services is just balancing out those factors. And that\u2019s not an easy task.\u201dLyft is not profitable, said a person briefed on the company\u2019s finances. Yet it has a $1.4 billion cash hoard, the person added, and the company thinks that will shield it as it works toward achieving profitability.Ms. Shaheen said an acquisition might still make sense for ride-hailing companies that needed more resources and a bigger size to compete.\u201cThere isn\u2019t a single company that has all of this expertise \u2014 software, manufacturing, ride-sharing \u2014 under one roof,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s where acquisition comes in.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Once Taunted by Steve Jobs, Companies Are Now Big Customers of Apple", "Date": "2016-08-07", "News": "Supported byThese days, the same could be said about Apple. Even IBM is promoting Apple gear.Apple\u2019s iPhones and iPads have become the preferred mobile computing devices for corporations, as industries from insurers to airlines aim to ditch bulky PCs and give their employees the ability to do their jobs from anywhere using smartphones or tablets.\u201cApple is stronger in the enterprise market with its devices than it is with consumers,\u201d said Frank Gillett, an industry analyst at Forrester.Pinpointing exact figures for Apple\u2019s corporate sales is difficult. Apple said growth was strong but declined to disclose recent numbers. During its last fiscal year, which ended in September, Apple said it sold $25 billion in gear and services to companies and other large customers. While that was only about 11 percent of the company\u2019s overall revenue, those business sales were up 40 percent from the previous year. That\u2019s compared with 28 percent growth for the entire business.Companies are turning to Apple\u2019s products for their tight-knit hardware and software, advanced security features and intuitive interfaces. Aiding Apple\u2019s corporate sales has been a concern that phones and tablets running Google\u2019s Android software, which are generally cheaper and popular with consumers, have lagged in the security technology and the standardization that companies want.For British Airways, which has built more than 40 custom iPad apps for its work force, switching to tablets has eliminated reams of paper used for flight plans, passenger manifests and maintenance records. Another app allows anyone at the airline to grab an iPad and quickly rebook passengers when a flight is canceled or weather wreaks havoc on schedules.\u201cWe can get to customers wherever they are,\u201d said Abigail Comber, who is in charge of the customer experience at the airline. \u201cIt\u2019s technology that\u2019s very intuitive. What the team has managed to do brilliantly is take away everything that happens on the back end.\u201d The carrier has so far deployed its apps across 17,000 iPads, and is looking to digitize even more of its business.Apple says it is focused on creating great devices \u2014 for all customers. \u201cWe\u2019re dedicated to building products that make people\u2019s lives better, often in ways that we couldn\u2019t have even imagined, enabling them to do things that they have never done before,\u201d Susan Prescott, vice president of worldwide product marketing, markets and applications, said in a statement. \u201cOur goal with business customers is the same \u2014 to enable them to do something great with mobile and truly modernize and transform their business.\u201dApple\u2019s increased attention to business customers has not come without internal angst.\u201cApple totally recognizes that their products are being used in a workplace context and not just at home,\u201d Mr. Gillett said. \u201cBut they are rabidly focused on making the world better for individual users. They have a strong fear if they begin to think too much about their enterprise customers, they will compromise the consumer experience.\u201dApple runs three-day boot camps for companies at its campus in Cupertino, Calif., to help them rapidly build prototype apps. But it was not an approach that could be scaled up to thousands of corporate customers.Hence Apple\u2019s decision to team up with other companies that specialize in catering to businesses. As Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, quipped at an industry conference last September: \u201cLife is short. We\u2019re going to die soon. And you\u2019ve got to have as many friends as you can.\u201dMahmoud Naghshineh, IBM\u2019s general manager for the Apple partnership, says Apple\u2019s devices appeal to companies that need to manage complex processes. IBM\u2019s strategy is to develop apps for specific industries, then customize them for each customer.Claims adjusters at Amica Mutual Insurance, for example, recently began using an IBM iPad app to collect information on claims, take photos, record statements and gain access to individual customer files. \u201cThe adjuster in the future will be able to complete their entire job on the iPad,\u201d said Adam Kostecki, an Amica manager involved in the project.Many companies are forging ahead on their own. Lowe\u2019s, the home improvement retailer, has built five iPod apps. One allows store employees to pull up reviews with 360-degree views of products, check inventory and guide customers to the exact location of a product within its warehouse-size outlets.Other apps allow employees to match a carpet pattern and estimate how much a customer would need to cover a given area. Inspired by the iPhone-based checkout system at Apple stores, Lowe\u2019s has even written a checkout app that it is testing in its two Manhattan stores.\u201cIf you think about devices that a lot of retailers provide to their associates, they aren\u2019t user-friendly. They are sometimes very old technology,\u201d said Eric Hanson, the director of digital experience at Lowe\u2019s. \u201cOur associates were deserving of an experience that was the same as we gave to our customers.\u201dVan Baker, an analyst at the Gartner research firm who studies mobile technology in businesses, said that most companies are just beginning to explore how mobile devices can transform their businesses. \u201cFor the vast majority of enterprises, mobile usage extends to email, contacts and calendars,\u201d he said.That opens up opportunities that Apple is cautiously pursuing.\u201cCook has taken a pragmatic approach without changing Apple\u2019s culture,\u201d Mr. Gillett, the Forrester analyst, said. Apple\u2019s philosophy, he said, is, \u201cWe want to stick to our knitting, what we\u2019re really good at \u2014 devices and software experiences for individuals \u2014 and work with others to translate Apple\u2019s strengths into the workplace.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Every Company Is a Tech Company, Does the Label Matter?", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "Supported byStrategiesApple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon have created something of a watershed moment in the stock market.They became the four most valuable companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index at the close of trading on Aug. 1, according to S.&P.\u2019s official tally. That meant that tech companies, by one common definition, occupied the four top spots in the market capitalization rankings, a rare and brief occurrence.\u201cIt may never have happened before at the close of trading,\u201d said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. The full history of daily rankings isn\u2019t readily available, however, so we can\u2019t be certain, and such rankings are evanescent, shifting with every tick of the stock market. In fact, on Friday, Amazon dropped back into sixth place.But no matter: The early August rankings were a reminder of how far tech has come. It is a dominant force in the stock market and the economy, one so all-encompassing that tech may no longer even be a useful concept for understanding today\u2019s stock market.One of them is Exxon Mobil, the energy giant and the most valuable company in the S.&P. as recently as 2012. But Exxon Mobil has been cut down in size by the oil price debacle. The other is Berkshire Hathaway, Warren E. Buffett\u2019s conglomerate, which the S.&P. categorizes as a financial services company \u2014 the only such company left in the Top 10 market cap list. Berkshire announced its own earnings after trading closed on Friday. We\u2019ll soon learn whether the market is pleased enough to vault Berkshire further ahead of Amazon.The three tech companies at the very top in market cap \u2014 Apple, Google and Microsoft \u2014 have held high positions for a long while. (Google, ranked second, trades as Alphabet, the name of its parent company.) Google passed Apple in value briefly this year, but Apple regained the top perch, which it has held since 2012. Microsoft, now No. 3, was the most valuable company during the last tech boom, in the early 2000s.Virtually no one disputes S.&P.\u2019s formal classification of Apple, Google and Microsoft as \u201cinformation technology\u201d companies. The same is true of Facebook, which held seventh place in the latest list of most valuable companies. But while Amazon is often described as a tech company \u2014 and undoubtedly uses and creates innovative technology \u2014 S.&P. has never classified it as one.In fact, Amazon is formally known as a \u201cconsumer discretionary company,\u201d like Walmart, which it has displaced as a member of the Top 10 most valuable companies. Amazon is the only consumer discretionary company left in the Top 10. Is it in some sense a tech company? Certainly, and we\u2019ll get back to that.But the same can be said, to one degree or another, about the three other members of the Top 10 \u2014 old companies that are still prospering in large part because of their mastery of advanced technologies. Johnson & Johnson, for example, which is ranked eighth, is a health care company, yet it is heavily involved in technology of a biological kind. Then there is General Electric, the diversified industrial company (and, until recently, also a financial services company), once described as a bellwether for the entire market. It conducts advanced research and sells tech products.Last on the list is AT&T, a telecommunications company, which, in an early form, helped create computer languages and operating systems on which modern tech companies are built. In 1957, when the S.&P. 500 was born, an ancestral version of AT&T was the most valuable company in the United States by a very wide margin, said Jeremy J. Siegel, a Wharton business school professor, the author of \u201cStocks for the Long Run\u201d and a market historian.\u201cAT&T back then was a highly regulated old phone company,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a giant, later broken up into smaller companies. And it was an outlier, because the other big companies in the S.&P. 500 in that era were mainly materials companies \u2014 like United States Steel, DuPont and Union Carbide \u2014 and an awful lot of oil companies.\u201dIn 1957, the economy ran on oil, and the biggest energy company was Standard Oil of New Jersey \u2014 an ancestor of Exxon Mobil. No pure tech company ranked in the Top 10 back then, not even IBM, which soon became the dominant tech company, a position it held until Microsoft surpassed it in the mid-1990s. That was the decade of the great tech boom, culminating in the bubble that burst in March 2000. Microsoft was No. 1 in market cap at the end of 1999, and four other tech companies \u2014 Cisco Systems, Intel, IBM and America Online \u2014 were also among the Top 10 most valuable companies. The stock market celebrated tech\u2019s ascendance then, as it does now.But this is a different era. When you dig deeper into the S.&P. 500, it\u2019s clear that while the valuations of tech companies swelled to unrealistically high proportions in those bubble years, the valuations of most companies are far more modest now. In March 2000, the height of the bubble, the value of information technology companies swelled to 34.5 percent of the total market cap of the S.&P. 500. At the moment, the comparable figure is only 20.7 percent, data from the Bespoke Investment Group shows. That\u2019s not much more than the 15.7 percent share of financial companies or the 15.2 percent share of the health care sector. By contrast, finance ballooned as high as 22.3 percent at the end of 2006, in what can be seen in hindsight as a financial bubble.On the other hand, materials and energy companies, which together constituted almost half of the total value of the S.&P. 500 in 1957, now account for less than 10 percent of it. That reflects the collapse of energy and commodity prices over the last few years, and it may well be a temporary phenomenon. In the meantime, diversified energy companies like Exxon Mobil are investing heavily in technology, a necessity if they are to flourish.It\u2019s clear even to energy companies, in other words, that tech\u2019s abiding power in the marketplace is not temporary. Technology permeates every sector of the economy, even those not formally classified as high-tech. Whether companies like Amazon and Johnson & Johnson should carry tech labels is beside the point. Tech has already taken over.These days every company is a tech company, but some have better niches, faster growth, more attractive offerings or more favorable share prices than others. These kinds of fundamental distinctions will influence the Top 10 rankings of the future.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Even Uber Couldn\u2019t Bridge the China Divide", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtTravis Kalanick, the co-founder and chief executive of the ride-hailing giant Uber, often defended his eagerness to risk billions on winning the Chinese market with a simple question: If you have a chance to become Amazon and Alibaba at the same time, why not try?The implication was simple. Over the last couple of decades, Amazon, Facebook, Google and other American technology giants have each followed a similar script for world domination. Like an imperial armada rolling out from North America\u2019s West Coast, these companies would try to establish beachheads on every other continent.But when American giants tried to enter the waters of China, the world\u2019s largest internet market, the armada invariably ran aground.Plagued by opaque and ever-shifting regulations and a culturally abstruse way of doing business, American companies fell to a series of local giants. Instead of Google, Baidu. Instead of Facebook, WeChat, owned by the giant Tencent. And instead of Amazon, Alibaba.That has left us with a divide: Today, there is the Chinese internet, and there is the internet of the rest of the world. A network seen in its early days as a tool to foster financial and political unity across a fragmented planet has irrevocably cleaved into two completely separate spheres.Entrepreneurs across the globe can choose to win in China or the rest of the world. You can be Alibaba or you can be Amazon. You can be Uber or you can be Didi. But you can\u2019t be both. Given the rising Chinese market and increasing tension over the role of American tech firms in the rest of the globe, the gulf between the two sides promises to become one of the most important factors in determining the shape of global tech innovation.How exactly might the war play out? In some ways, being at the mercy of two poles of internet leadership could be good for citizens of planet Earth. In emerging markets like India, the Middle East and parts of Africa and South America, the giants of China and the United States are increasingly investing billions to compete for local customers in e-commerce, social networking, ride sharing and other markets.\u201cAmazon is increasingly making its own branded products, taking on Procter & Gamble and others, and also getting into the logistics business, and shipping, and everything else,\u201d Mr. Clark said. \u201cBut Alibaba is a marketplace that doesn\u2019t hold inventory and describes themselves as helping local merchants \u2014 so maybe there\u2019s some argument that Alibaba could serve as a counter globally to Amazon.\u201d\u201cIn that way it could be like the Yalta Conference,\u201d said Mr. Clark, referring to the 1945 meeting in which the victors of World War II determined the postwar geopolitical order.\u201cThe barrels that will be thrown at you when you\u2019re trying to do business in China will just never stop,\u201d said Mark Natkin, the managing director of Marbridge Consulting, an advisory firm based in Beijing. \u201cYou\u2019ll constantly be above one barrel or recovering from jumping one, and as you\u2019re dusting yourself off you look down the road and here comes the next one.\u201dCompared with previous failures, Uber seemed to do everything right in China. It set up a separate company, Uber China, which had a buy-in from local investors, including from a local giant, Baidu. It hired many local experts, and worked closely with the national government to foster friendly relations.Insiders say Mr. Kalanick was also personally invested in the deal. He visited China eight times in the last year and a half, and became something of a tech star in the Chinese media.Publicly Mr. Kalanick had insisted he was fighting for total victory in China. But he must have known that Uber would always struggle to achieve dominance, given the emerging centrality of ride-sharing to the future of infrastructure in China. Still, even if he failed to win everything in China, investing early in the country seemed too big to skip.For now, it\u2019s especially delicious frosting. The $2 billion Uber spent tackling China is now worth about $7 billion in the new merged entity; if Didi does become one of China\u2019s largest tech companies, the value of Uber\u2019s stake in China could rise geometrically, making the firm much more attractive in a potential initial public offering. Pulling out of China also frees up Uber to invest more in other markets \u2014 India and Indonesia are big targets \u2014 as well as expand its expertise in core technological initiatives like mapping data and self-driving cars.But if spending big to tackle China ultimately works out for Uber, it will be an anomaly, and certainly not a model for other American tech giants.\u201cThe ride-sharing market is one the few markets where the upside is big enough to justify going in,\u201d Mr. Thompson said. \u201cFor most other companies, going into China is still going to be nothing but pain.\u201dEmail: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Florida Company Gets Approval to Put Robotic Lander on Moon", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "Supported byA small start-up has received the green light from the federal government to do something that NASA has not done for more than four decades: land on the moon.Moon Express has a ways to go before it can reach the lunar surface, which it hopes to do next year. It still has to assemble the lander. The rocket that it plans to launch on has yet to fly even once.And one of its competitors could beat it to the moon, and the $20 million.The approval reflects an effort to encourage 21st-century commercial space endeavors while staying within an international space treaty written 49 years ago when outer space was a rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, and the idea of a start-up going to the moon an unlikely fantasy.The Juno spacecraft has reached Jupiter. Here are some other spacecraft exploring our solar system, launched by NASA and the world\u2019s other space agencies.In the bubbly optimism that followed, the X Prize Foundation enlisted Google to finance reaching the loftier target of the moon. The Google Lunar X Prize, announced in 2007, called for putting a spacecraft on the moon that would be able to send back video and images and also move more than 500 meters. The first team to achieve that would claim $20 million; second place would be rewarded with $5 million.For John Noble Wilford, the reporter who covered the moon landing for The New York Times from mission control in Houston, the memory is invigorating.As Moon Express worked on its MX-1 lander, company officials realized that they had other hurdles: paperwork and international treaties.The United States fought to include that clause, rejecting the Soviet view that space exploration should be limited to governments, said Matthew Schaefer, the director of the space, cyber and telecommunications law program at the University of Nebraska.While the American negotiators did not necessarily foresee a company like Moon Express, \u201cthe U.S. government wanted to keep that option open,\u201d Professor Schaefer said.Nonetheless, that would have been a roadblock, said Dr. Richards, Moon Express\u2019s chief executive, because the United States did not have any procedures for authorizing and supervising what companies like Moon Express want to do.\u201cAny application to the U.S. government would have been vetoed by the State Department, due to the lack of regulatory frameworks that would allow the U.S. government to remain in compliance with the Outer Space Treaty,\u201d he said.Moon Express has now employed this payload review process for its lunar trip. The F.A.A. sent its approval on July 20, the 47th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing on the moon.Mr. Jain said that low-cost missions to the moon \u2014 under $10 million \u2014 would transform space exploration. But the company has revealed little about its customers and much of the hoped-for business like the mining of platinum and helium-3 is speculative. (The helium-3 would be for fusion power plants that do not yet exist.)At present, there is little worry that the moonscape is about to be scarred by a commercial onslaught. The MX-1 is about the size of a coffee table, and NASA has left far more litter on the moon, most recently crashing its Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer into the far side of the moon in 2014.Of more concern is the preservation of earlier artifacts like the Apollo landing sites, especially as the Lunar X Prize offers a $4 million bonus for broadcasting video from one of those sites.Moon Express said that it had not yet decided on a landing site, but that it would defer to NASA\u2019s wishes and stay away from the Apollo sites.Mr. Jain said the greatest opportunities were the ones not yet imagined, just as Apple, when it created the iPhone, did not foresee the explosion of apps that would run on the device.\u201cMore importantly,\u201d Mr. Jain said, \u201cwe don\u2019t know what the Pok\u00e9mon Go of the moon is going to be.\u201dAn earlier version of this article gave an outdated location for the headquarters of Moon Express. The company is now based in Cape Canaveral, Fla., not Mountain View, Calif. The error was repeated in the headline.Advertisement"}

The jet noise can be quite loud in the area at times, but to me it\u2019s the sound of freedom. You\u2019ll often see bumper stickers around here with that phrase.In January I took over from my predecessor, Fred Whyte, and moved into his office. Before that I was vice president for finance, I.T. and H.R. I didn\u2019t want to invest a lot of money in making sweeping changes to the office, and I also wanted to send the message that we\u2019ve been extremely successful so far and I wanted to continue on that path. I substituted some photos and added new chairs, some technology and personal items.Open to the worldI\u2019m South African. My grandfather was a missionary there and lived in the bush. Both he and my father were accepting of all people and cultures in a time when others were not. They both had the strength and character I hope to achieve. Often, as you grow up, you build a framework of how you think the world works, but as you travel, meet new people and experience new cultures, you realize there are other frames of reference and ways of doing things.2. Show and tellI\u2019m a visual learner. I ask staff members to bring whatever they\u2019re working on to meetings so we can all see the product or part. For example, we manufacture the pistons here that are used in our chain saws, blowers, hedge trimmers and other products. When we\u2019re talking about a component or an assembly, I want to make sure we all have the same understanding, and it\u2019s so much quicker if you have the object in front of you during the discussion.3. Keeping it in lineIn 2007 we built a plant here to manufacture guide bars, the part that directs or guides the cutting chain on a saw blade. Previously they were all built at a Stihl facility in Germany. This one is signed by Hans Peter Stihl, a son of the company founder, who visits here every year.Breaking bread with workersI never eat lunch in my office. I try to catch up with staff at that time. Either I go to our canteen or go out with someone. Once a month I attend a luncheon for employees celebrating milestone anniversaries. My favorite part is when employees talk about their long history with Stihl. Recently three people celebrated 35 years.4.

I\u2019ll often transfer whatever I\u2019m working on to the TV. During meetings in my office, I like to pull up calendars, spreadsheets and so forth on the screen so we can view the details together. I also have an Apple Watch tethered to my iPhone that notifies me about coming meetings.Vying for the lumberjack crownI\u2019ve displayed a few photos from our company collection that are representative of people who use our products. We sponsor various competitions and own and run the annual Stihl Timbersports series, which we established in 1985. One of the photos is of a contestant vying for the title of best lumberjack. Another is of a worker cutting down a tree. I especially like a photo of firefighters from Virginia Beach.A personalized prototypeWhen we were experimenting with 3-D printers, one of our engineers printed my name in 3-D to try to sell me on how they could be used at Stihl. I spent time with him understanding how they could help with metal production pieces we were sending out to be made. Now we use two printers to produce jigs and fittings.Making the roundsI travel to Germany two or three times a year to our headquarters, and about once a month I visit some of our six Stihl branches and five independent distributors in the United States. They sell to more than 9,000 Stihl servicing dealers.Message in a bottleMy predecessor could be a bit of a prankster. He left me a Japanese scroll and a note saying it was my business plan.

We really want to invest a lot in that nexus, and having someone like him bridge that and speak on our behalf is really powerful.\u201dPandora, which began in 2005 and went public in 2011, has long been the most popular internet radio service, and it is one of a handful of digital music brands that have become household names. But its growth has slowed as it has faced more pressure from streaming competitors. Pandora\u2019s number of average monthly listeners reached its peak at the end of 2014, at 81.5 million.\u201cPandora is in a difficult chapter,\u201d said Mark Mulligan, a digital media analyst with Midia Research. \u201cWall Street doesn\u2019t like mature growth stories in young tech companies.

In its earlier days, Pandora stayed largely independent of the music industry, relying on statutory licensing processes rather than dealing with record labels, which has sometimes resulted in ill will over royalties. Last year, Pandora reported that it paid $610 million, or about 52 percent of its revenue, in royalties and related costs.These days, Pandora is eager to promote the marketing platforms it makes available to artists, such as audio messages that can be delivered to fans and detailed data about the popularity of particular songs. When asked, Questlove said he initially had some hesitation about working with Pandora given its past conflicts with music world, but said he was confident that the company paid its royalty obligations properly and that part of his job would be to speak up for musicians in the company.Mr. Westergren said he was \u201cvery open to a candid assessment of how artists think about it.\u201dQuestlove said he was most excited about the possibilities of producing a radio show that would open listeners\u2019 eyes to more than just the biggest and most heavily promoted pop.

{"Headline": "Should You Charge Your Phone Overnight?", "Date": "2016-08-22", "News": "Supported byChances are, you plug in your phone before you go to bed at night, thinking it\u2019s best to greet the morning with a fully charged device.Is this a good idea?Here\u2019s the thing. Many people don\u2019t expect to keep their phones for much longer than two years.For the most part, experts say, those people are not going to notice much damage to their phone batteries before they start hankering for a new device.If that sounds like you, feel free to charge every night, and as often as you like in between.But frequent charging takes a toll on the lithium-ion batteries in our phones. And it\u2019s not because they can be overcharged, said Edo Campos, a spokesman for Anker, which produces phone chargers.\u201cSmartphones are, in fact, smart,\u201d Mr. Campos said. \u201cThey know when to stop charging.\u201dAndroid phones and iPhones are equipped with chips that protect them from absorbing excess electrical current once they are fully charged.So in theory, any damage from charging your phone overnight with an official charger, or a trustworthy off-brand charger, should be negligible.But the act of charging is itself bad for your phone\u2019s battery.Most phones make use of a technology that allows their batteries to accept more current faster. Hatem Zeine, the founder, chief scientist and chief technical officer of the wireless charging company Ossia, says the technology enables phones to adjust to the amount of charge that a charger is capable of supplying.The technology allows power to pulse into the battery in specific modulations, increasing the speed at which the lithium ions in the battery travel from one side to the other and causing the battery to charge more quickly.\u201cWhen you charge fast all the time, you limit the life span of the battery,\u201d Mr. Zeine said.If you\u2019re intent on preserving a lithium-ion battery beyond the lifetime of the typical phone or tablet, Mr. Zeine suggested using a charger meant for a less powerful device, though he couldn\u2019t guarantee that it would work.\u201cFor example, if you used an iPhone charger on an iPad Pro, it\u2019s going to charge very slowly,\u201d Mr. Zeine said. \u201cIf the electronics are right, they can actually preserve the battery because you\u2019re always charging it slowly.\u201dPeople looking to preserve their batteries should make sure their phones don\u2019t become overheated, Mr. Campos advised, because high temperatures further excite the lithium-ion in batteries, leading to even quicker deterioration.Both Mr. Zeine and Mr. Campos noted that given the constant demand for new cellphones, charging overnight might not be a point of great concern for many people.Advertisement"}

Apple\u2019s new suite of operating systems appears to replace its pistol emoji, which was an image of a six-shooter, with a squirt gun.Apple\u2019s change is ill considered because it breaks the conceptual compatibility that Unicode is meant to establish. Anyone with an iPhone ought to be able to send a message to someone with another company\u2019s products \u2014 like Google or Microsoft or Samsung \u2014 and have what\u2019s delivered communicate the same idea as what\u2019s sent. But with this change, a squirt gun sent from an iPhone will turn into a handgun when received by an Android device, and vice versa.Those behind the campaign to remove the gun from the phone do not appear to be relying on arguments about kids\u2019, or everyone else\u2019s, malleability. Rather, they have portrayed it as a traditional grass-roots messaging campaign: \u201cBy removing the gun emoji,\u201d they write, \u201cwe\u2019ll show America wants stricter access to real guns.\u201d Apple is surely free to favor gun control as a matter of corporate policy \u2014 but it should not be tinkering with our right to express either that or a contrary view on worldwide platforms.It need not be this way. Rather, our devices already enable tech-savvy individuals to invent new emoji-like graphics to send their friends \u2014 and that their friends in turn can pass on to others. Those that attain extensive use could then be standardized in a routine way through Unicode and made available to everyone.Apple, Microsoft, Google and other \u201cbig tech\u201d companies should not be placed in a position, which they themselves do not want, of having to decide which words or emojis do and don\u2019t represent their brand. Apple should be no more responsible if someone uses a gun image in the abstract than if someone happens to type the word \u201cgun.\u201dAs free citizens, we acquiesce to infantilizing digital infrastructure at our peril.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Daily Report: More Clean Energy, Brought to You by the Cloud", "Date": "2016-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsThe cloud, as it turns out, may have a very green lining.A prime reason for this is the growing demand from its cloud computing centers, where Apple keeps its customers\u2019 music, photos and much more.On this front, Apple joins a number of other cloud providers, who collectively may change the face of energy production by increasing demand for renewable energy.Big cloud-computing companies are building facilities on an unparalleled scale, and at a time when few others are increasing demand. Dominion Virginia Power, which supplies perhaps the world\u2019s greatest concentration of data centers, reported that overall demand rose 1 percent last year, but demand from data centers rose 9 percent.Amazon Web Services has since committed to obtaining 100 percent of its power from renewable sources. Last year the company purchased a 250,000-panel, 80-megawatt plant in Virginia, which it later sold to Dominion.Other data centers have long been situated near big dams, which provide cheap as well as green power. Lots of building is happening in Iowa, Texas and elsewhere in America\u2019s great wind corridor, to encourage the construction of more wind-driven facilities.Remote locations have other benefits. \u201cWhen your nearest neighbor is 100 acres away, you don\u2019t get as many complaints about the power lines,\u201d said Joe Kava, who heads Google\u2019s data center operations.There are signs it is affecting the way utilities plan future construction. American Electric Power, which operates in 11 states, has said it will add 6,300 megawatts of new wind power and 3,100 megawatts of new solar generation before 2033. An AEP official told me that much of this was attributable to demand from data centers.For many of these companies, it\u2019s not just about saving the planet; power has moved from an incidental cost to a main determinant of profitability. Like nothing else, that has affected the operation of data centers in ways that may improve other big companies\u2019 power consumption.The traditional measure of data center efficiency is power usage effectiveness, or P.U.E. This measures how much power goes into a data center and how much of that is used by computing equipment. For a poorly run center, this number can be 2.0 or higher, meaning it takes two watts of power to put one watt into a computer.Together, these companies are building with their clouds a new kind of industrial infrastructure. It would be something if it also reshaped our power usage for the better.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cloud Computing Brings Sprawling Centers, but Few Jobs, to Small Towns", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "Supported byBoydton JournalBOYDTON, Va. \u2014 A giant Microsoft facility just outside this very small town hides behind a quarter-mile berm and a guard house, across the highway from the rubble of a demolished prison.Behind the berm, six unmarked hangars each hold tens of thousands of computer servers. Microsoft has cleared enough scrub trees and vines for at least 15 of these buildings, and six more are already under construction.One thing there isn\u2019t much of at this Microsoft complex, one single computer data center, is long-term work. Microsoft says it might have \u201cseveral dozen\u201d employees in a place like this. They are mostly elite computer workers who tend not to come from Boydton, which lost a lot of good jobs when nearby factories closed and the prison shut down.So it is in a number of small towns across the country, as technology giants like Amazon, Google and Microsoft race to build networks of unprecedented size to provide services over the internet, a technology trend known as cloud computing. Local people, along with many economists and officials, often think these data centers are a key to an industrial revival. But the reality is less impressive.\u201cI\u2019ve worked on a lot of nuclear power plants, and these things are a lot bigger than that,\u201d said E. W. Gregory, the head of the local electrical workers\u2019 union. But \u201cthe first thing they put in was a guard shack and a fence. I\u2019ve filled rooms with people looking for entry-level work. None of it lasts.\u201dThe companies come to places like Boydton for basics like land, water and electricity. Even with low local wages, people are a high-cost item. As small as the staffs at these mammoth facilities are, companies say, perhaps a third of the company jobs will eventually be filled by robots.Google started building in eastern Oregon to be near cheap hydroelectric power on the Columbia River, and most recently it has focused on Iowa, Alabama and Tennessee. Microsoft has a center in Wyoming, and it bought a nine-hole golf course as part of a complex near West Des Moines, Iowa. Amazon recently built similar giant facilities on the outer reaches of Columbus, Ohio, and Dulles, Va.\u201cA lot of this stuff is put in rural parts of the country that used to be part of a manufacturing economy\u201d that has gone overseas, said Bill Coughran, a partner at the venture investment firm Sequoia Capital who ran much of Google\u2019s big engineering for eight years. \u201cTextiles and furniture created a big power grid in the south. Then those jobs went away.\u201dThat\u2019s been the story for Boydton, population 430, in the middle of tobacco country a few miles from the North Carolina border. The prison across from the Microsoft center closed in 2012. A nearby Burlington Industries textile plant that employed more than 2,000 shut in 2002. It was razed in 2012.The South Virginia tobacco economy collapsed as Americans cut back on smoking. But in 1999, Virginia used some of the $4.1 billion it received in a settlement with cigarette makers to build high-speed fiber-optic lines throughout the region.The broadband drew Microsoft, along with some financial perks. Mecklenburg County, which received $2.1 million from the state for the project, has given Microsoft 350 acres and offset personal property taxes by 82.5 percent, according to Wayne Carter, the county administrator.Initially, Apple, which is building a big cloud center for consumers\u2019 photos and music, wanted the Boydton site, but it went across the border to North Carolina, which promised tax breaks on its data center equipment. Not to be outdone, Virginia passed laws in 2009 and 2010 that exempted sales taxes on things like data center computer servers, software, power generators and chillers to cool all that equipment.\u201cWe\u2019ve had six years of construction work,\u201d said Mr. Carter. That has helped the county, he said, because even temporary workers rent houses, stay in hotels and eat in local restaurants.Microsoft did not dispute reports that it would spend $1.1 billion on the Boydton data center, and said that \u201con average, data centers employ tens to several dozen people,\u201d in a mixture of corporate and contracted positions. It declined to let a reporter tour the site.\u201cThey talked about 100 jobs, but it\u2019s a slow process,\u201d said Thomas C. Coleman III, the mayor of Boydton. So far, he says, the biggest impact \u201chas been a couple of lunch tables at the Triangle gas station.\u201dHe understates matters, but not by much. Mr. Gregory, the electrician, said his union had hundreds of applicants for work digging ditches and laying pipe, starting at $10.88 an hour. Wiring paid $28.59. Both jobs tended to last about six months, he said, with lots of attrition for the hard outdoor labor.Working as a security guard or as someone testing the wires inside the data center offers better money, but there are not many positions.

{"Headline": "Think Amazon\u2019s Drone Delivery Idea Is a Gimmick? Think Again", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtAmazon is the most obscure large company in the tech industry.It isn\u2019t just secretive, the way Apple is, but in a deeper sense, Jeff Bezos\u2019 e-commerce and cloud-storage giant is opaque. Amazon rarely explains either its near-term tactical aims or its long-term strategic vision. It values surprise.To understand Amazon, then, is necessarily to engage in a kind of Kremlinology. That\u2019s especially true of the story behind one of its most important business areas: the logistics by which it ships orders to its customers.So what\u2019s Amazon\u2019s ultimate aim in delivery? After talking to analysts, partners and competitors, and prying some very minimal input from Amazon itself, I suspect the company has a two-tiered vision for the future of shipping.First, it\u2019s not trying to replace third-party shippers. Instead, over the next few years, Amazon wants to add as much capacity to its operations as possible, and rather than replace partners like UPS and FedEx, it is spending boatloads on planes, trucks, crowdsourcing and other novel delivery services to add to its overall capacity and efficiency.Amazon\u2019s longer-term goal is more fantastical \u2014 and, if it succeeds, potentially transformative. It wants to escape the messy vicissitudes of roads and humans. It wants to go fully autonomous, up in the sky. The company\u2019s drone program, which many in the tech press dismissed as a marketing gimmick when Mr. Bezos unveiled it on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in 2013, is central to this future; drones could be combined with warehouses manned by robots and trucks that drive themselves to unlock a new autonomous future for Amazon.If Amazon\u2019s drone program succeeds (and Amazon says it is well on track), it could fundamentally alter the company\u2019s cost structure. A decade from now, drones would reduce the unit cost of each Amazon delivery by about half, analysts at Deutsche Bank projected in a recent research report. If that happens, the economic threat to competitors would be punishing \u2014 \u201cretail stores would cease to exist,\u201d Deutsche\u2019s analysts suggested, and we would live in a world more like that of \u201cThe Jetsons\u201d than our own.Shipping has always been at the core of Amazon\u2019s strategic investments. In its earliest days, as part of an effort to avoid collecting sales tax from most customers, Amazon purposefully placed warehouses in low-tax, low-population states, and then shipped goods to populous areas within three to five days.As consumer and commercial drones increase in popularity, the government is taking more steps to address safety concerns and regulate the aerial vehicles.The 2005 introduction of Amazon\u2019s Prime subscription program, which gives customers two-day delivery on many goods for an annual price of $99, changed Amazon\u2019s shipping needs. Prime encouraged customers to buy a lot more stuff, and it also forced Amazon to deliver packages more quickly.For Amazon, that projected future is catastrophic: Pretty much all of Amazon\u2019s current investments in shipping \u2014 in trucks, planes and crowdsourced delivery cars \u2014 depend on the traditional shipping infrastructure.All, that is, except for drones \u2014 which explains why they are integral to Amazon\u2019s vision of the future of retail.When I began talking to others in the drone industry about Amazon\u2019s interest in autonomous flight, they all pointed out that drones offer a way to leapfrog roads. Because they operate in a new, untrammeled layer of physical space \u2014 below 400 feet, an airspace that is currently unoccupied in most of the country \u2014 they open up a vast new shipping lane.Scenes like that are most likely in the far-off future. But according to Amazon, the earliest incarnation of drone deliveries will happen much sooner \u2014 we will see it within five years, somewhere in the world.Email: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Should You Charge Your Phone Overnight?", "Date": "2016-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChances are, you plug in your phone before you go to bed at night, thinking it\u2019s best to greet the morning with a fully charged device.Is this a good idea?Here\u2019s the thing. Many people don\u2019t expect to keep their phones for much longer than two years.For the most part, experts say, those people are not going to notice much damage to their phone batteries before they start hankering for a new device.If that sounds like you, feel free to charge every night, and as often as you like in between.But frequent charging takes a toll on the lithium-ion batteries in our phones. And it\u2019s not because they can be overcharged, said Edo Campos, a spokesman for Anker, which produces phone chargers.\u201cSmartphones are, in fact, smart,\u201d Mr. Campos said. \u201cThey know when to stop charging.\u201dAndroid phones and iPhones are equipped with chips that protect them from absorbing excess electrical current once they are fully charged.So in theory, any damage from charging your phone overnight with an official charger, or a trustworthy off-brand charger, should be negligible.But the act of charging is itself bad for your phone\u2019s battery.Most phones make use of a technology that allows their batteries to accept more current faster. Hatem Zeine, the founder, chief scientist and chief technical officer of the wireless charging company Ossia, says the technology enables phones to adjust to the amount of charge that a charger is capable of supplying.The technology allows power to pulse into the battery in specific modulations, increasing the speed at which the lithium ions in the battery travel from one side to the other and causing the battery to charge more quickly.\u201cWhen you charge fast all the time, you limit the life span of the battery,\u201d Mr. Zeine said.If you\u2019re intent on preserving a lithium-ion battery beyond the lifetime of the typical phone or tablet, Mr. Zeine suggested using a charger meant for a less powerful device, though he couldn\u2019t guarantee that it would work.\u201cFor example, if you used an iPhone charger on an iPad Pro, it\u2019s going to charge very slowly,\u201d Mr. Zeine said. \u201cIf the electronics are right, they can actually preserve the battery because you\u2019re always charging it slowly.\u201dPeople looking to preserve their batteries should make sure their phones don\u2019t become overheated, Mr. Campos advised, because high temperatures further excite the lithium-ion in batteries, leading to even quicker deterioration.Both Mr. Zeine and Mr. Campos noted that given the constant demand for new cellphones, charging overnight might not be a point of great concern for many people.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Speeds Toward a Driverless Future, Putting Jobs in Danger", "Date": "2016-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsTravis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s chief executive, has made no secret of wanting to replace its chauffeurs with cars that can ferry passengers without driver input. Uber is not alone. From old-school car and truck manufacturers and parts makers to Silicon Valley interlopers like Tesla, Apple and Alphabet, dozens of companies are racing to develop driverless technology.Along with saving valuable time, fully autonomous vehicles could reduce traffic accidents by 90 percent or more, the Boston Consulting Group has estimated. That would avoid hundreds of billions of dollars in injuries, vehicle damage and lost productivity caused by traffic accidents, which kill more than 30,000 Americans each year.There is a big downside, though. Heavy trucking employs nearly two million people across the United States, with a median salary of over $40,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That is about double what hundreds of thousands of others employed as taxi and limousine drivers make. Both industries are now firmly in Uber\u2019s cross hairs.The jobs might not disappear completely, of course. Moreover, shifting from today\u2019s limited autonomy features like automatic braking and lane correction to truly self-driving vehicles across the country is a huge technology challenge that could take years and draw serious political resistance. Even in a fully autonomous world, freight haulers and livery services would still need mechanics and tech specialists to keep fleets rolling.Still, the threat is clear. And America\u2019s threadbare social safety net and worker-retraining programs may struggle to support a mass retooling of skills. That would heap further pressure on working-class communities already reeling from the loss of more than five million manufacturing jobs over the last two decades.Uber\u2019s new partnerships are the latest sign that the push to driverless is accelerating.

{"Headline": "Fact-Checking Apple\u2019s Claims on E.U. Tax Ruling", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInstead, Mr. Cook framed Apple\u2019s operations in Ireland as an investment in the people there, declared that Apple has a history as a good corporate tax citizen, and added that the European Commission\u2019s decision will hurt investment and business growth in Europe.We examined some of the points Mr. Cook made in the letter, consulting with five tax experts to fact-check the chief executive\u2019s statements. While Mr. Cook was technically truthful, he omitted some context and shifted the spotlight from the thrust of the European Commission\u2019s case: whether Apple took advantage of loopholes in Irish tax laws.The issue of how much money Apple pays in taxes is also a bit of a red herring. \u201cThis fight with the European Union is not about what the company has paid in taxes overall, but about how much it should pay,\u201d said Steven Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. \u201cTax systems are not a pay-what-you-want system.\u201d_________The European Union wants to crack down on the ways that companies minimize their tax bills in Europe, especially in Ireland. In the 1980s, Ireland began modeling itself after Bermuda, a well-known corporate tax haven, said Khadija Sharife, a forensic financial researcher and an editor at the African Network of Centers for Investigative Reporting. Ireland\u2019s corporate tax rate is 12.5 percent, compared with 35 percent in the United States.While Ireland is phasing out some corporation-friendly rules, \u201ccompanies will continue to come up with ways to pay less taxes in other countries until all countries across the world can agree on corporate tax rules,\u201d said Lisa De Simone, assistant professor of accounting at Stanford University.__________The rest of Apple\u2019s income that was not recognized and taxed in Ireland could be put in other corporate structures that were effectively stateless. That meant the money in those structures was not taxable anywhere \u2014 not even in Ireland \u2014 and thus not subject to Ireland\u2019s 12.5 percent tax rate.While other companies have also had the right to negotiate with Ireland, the commission considers these sorts of loopholes a no-no.\u201cIn the U.S., states can fall all over themselves to offer subsidies and loopholes, but that is exactly what is illegal in Europe,\u201d said Edward D. Kleinbard, professor at the Gould School of Law at the University of Southern California and a former chief of staff to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.____________________While the E.U. has been trying to create harmony across the region when it comes to how to treat corporate taxes, for now taxes are \u201can issue for each individual member state in Europe,\u201d said Dr. Liza Lovdahl Gormsen with the British Institute of International and Comparative Law. She said this case creates uncertainty for many multinational companies across Europe.__________But Ms. De Simone said Apple has also kept more than $200 billion in accumulated profits offshore. That money could someday be brought home and taxed, but Apple is in control of whether or not that actually happens.__________But Mr. Rosenthal said the issue is ultimately broader than Europe. People would do well to also remember the total amount of government revenue being lost to low-cost tax deals, he said.\u201cIf we allow companies like Apple to pick its tax haven \u2014 to place a few thousand employees in a place for a lower tax rate \u2014 we do add a few jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cBut more widely, the taxes given up globally could be used for public service, worker training and infrastructure repair.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Once Taunted by Steve Jobs, Companies Are Now Big Customers of Apple", "Date": "2016-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThese days, the same could be said about Apple. Even IBM is promoting Apple gear.Apple\u2019s iPhones and iPads have become the preferred mobile computing devices for corporations, as industries from insurers to airlines aim to ditch bulky PCs and give their employees the ability to do their jobs from anywhere using smartphones or tablets.\u201cApple is stronger in the enterprise market with its devices than it is with consumers,\u201d said Frank Gillett, an industry analyst at Forrester.Pinpointing exact figures for Apple\u2019s corporate sales is difficult. Apple said growth was strong but declined to disclose recent numbers. During its last fiscal year, which ended in September, Apple said it sold $25 billion in gear and services to companies and other large customers. While that was only about 11 percent of the company\u2019s overall revenue, those business sales were up 40 percent from the previous year. That\u2019s compared with 28 percent growth for the entire business.Companies are turning to Apple\u2019s products for their tight-knit hardware and software, advanced security features and intuitive interfaces. Aiding Apple\u2019s corporate sales has been a concern that phones and tablets running Google\u2019s Android software, which are generally cheaper and popular with consumers, have lagged in the security technology and the standardization that companies want.For British Airways, which has built more than 40 custom iPad apps for its work force, switching to tablets has eliminated reams of paper used for flight plans, passenger manifests and maintenance records. Another app allows anyone at the airline to grab an iPad and quickly rebook passengers when a flight is canceled or weather wreaks havoc on schedules.\u201cWe can get to customers wherever they are,\u201d said Abigail Comber, who is in charge of the customer experience at the airline. \u201cIt\u2019s technology that\u2019s very intuitive. What the team has managed to do brilliantly is take away everything that happens on the back end.\u201d The carrier has so far deployed its apps across 17,000 iPads, and is looking to digitize even more of its business.Apple says it is focused on creating great devices \u2014 for all customers. \u201cWe\u2019re dedicated to building products that make people\u2019s lives better, often in ways that we couldn\u2019t have even imagined, enabling them to do things that they have never done before,\u201d Susan Prescott, vice president of worldwide product marketing, markets and applications, said in a statement. \u201cOur goal with business customers is the same \u2014 to enable them to do something great with mobile and truly modernize and transform their business.\u201dApple\u2019s increased attention to business customers has not come without internal angst.\u201cApple totally recognizes that their products are being used in a workplace context and not just at home,\u201d Mr. Gillett said. \u201cBut they are rabidly focused on making the world better for individual users. They have a strong fear if they begin to think too much about their enterprise customers, they will compromise the consumer experience.\u201dApple runs three-day boot camps for companies at its campus in Cupertino, Calif., to help them rapidly build prototype apps. But it was not an approach that could be scaled up to thousands of corporate customers.Hence Apple\u2019s decision to team up with other companies that specialize in catering to businesses. As Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, quipped at an industry conference last September: \u201cLife is short. We\u2019re going to die soon. And you\u2019ve got to have as many friends as you can.\u201dMahmoud Naghshineh, IBM\u2019s general manager for the Apple partnership, says Apple\u2019s devices appeal to companies that need to manage complex processes. IBM\u2019s strategy is to develop apps for specific industries, then customize them for each customer.Claims adjusters at Amica Mutual Insurance, for example, recently began using an IBM iPad app to collect information on claims, take photos, record statements and gain access to individual customer files. \u201cThe adjuster in the future will be able to complete their entire job on the iPad,\u201d said Adam Kostecki, an Amica manager involved in the project.Many companies are forging ahead on their own. Lowe\u2019s, the home improvement retailer, has built five iPod apps. One allows store employees to pull up reviews with 360-degree views of products, check inventory and guide customers to the exact location of a product within its warehouse-size outlets.Other apps allow employees to match a carpet pattern and estimate how much a customer would need to cover a given area. Inspired by the iPhone-based checkout system at Apple stores, Lowe\u2019s has even written a checkout app that it is testing in its two Manhattan stores.\u201cIf you think about devices that a lot of retailers provide to their associates, they aren\u2019t user-friendly. They are sometimes very old technology,\u201d said Eric Hanson, the director of digital experience at Lowe\u2019s. \u201cOur associates were deserving of an experience that was the same as we gave to our customers.\u201dVan Baker, an analyst at the Gartner research firm who studies mobile technology in businesses, said that most companies are just beginning to explore how mobile devices can transform their businesses. \u201cFor the vast majority of enterprises, mobile usage extends to email, contacts and calendars,\u201d he said.That opens up opportunities that Apple is cautiously pursuing.\u201cCook has taken a pragmatic approach without changing Apple\u2019s culture,\u201d Mr. Gillett, the Forrester analyst, said. Apple\u2019s philosophy, he said, is, \u201cWe want to stick to our knitting, what we\u2019re really good at \u2014 devices and software experiences for individuals \u2014 and work with others to translate Apple\u2019s strengths into the workplace.\u201dAdvertisement"}

There are promises to register with local law enforcement, to complete therapy if it is required and to not pick up hitchhikers or visit schools or playgrounds.And at the end there is a new entry: no Pok\u00e9mon Go.\u201cI understand that I shall not download, access, or otherwise engage in any internet-enabled gaming activities to include Pok\u00e9mon Go,\u201d it reads.The appearance of the popular smartphone game \u2014 in which players catch Pok\u00e9mon, digital creatures with names such as Squirtle and Jigglypuff \u2014 on the gloomy bureaucratic document was not a joke or a prank. It was a serious policy enacted by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, this month to protect children who play games over the internet.But advocates for civil liberties said they were skeptical of whether the new stipulation, which would apply to about 3,000 paroled sex offenders in the state, was appropriate.Pok\u00e9mon Go takes the form of a treasure hunt, with a digital map on a cellphone leading a player to real locations \u2014 many of them landmarks \u2014 to try to collect Pok\u00e9mon characters. The augmented reality game splices a digital layer onto the physical world: Pok\u00e9mon appear based on a player\u2019s physical location, and the cartoon creatures are seen through the phone\u2019s camera, creating an image that melds the virtual to the real \u2014 a smiley Bulbasaur near a Central Park fountain, for example.But to State Senators Jeffrey D. Klein and Diane J. Savino, both Democrats, it presented \u201ca virtual road map to our children,\u201d Mr. Klein said in a news release. In an informal investigation, they looked at 100 addresses of registered sex offenders across New York City and found Pok\u00e9mon near 57 of them. And they highlighted an instance in Indiana in which a sex offender was reportedly caught playing the game with a 16-year-old.Mr. Cuomo, in a statement explaining that the order was inspired by the investigation, said, \u201cThese actions will provide safeguards\u201d and \u201chelp take one more tool away from those seeking to do harm to our children.\u201dMr. Cuomo\u2019s office said that the game\u2019s \u201clure\u201d feature, which allows players to attract more Pok\u00e9mon to certain locations, \u201cappears to have the potential to be abused by predators.\u201dStill, Alphonso David, the governor\u2019s chief counsel, said, \u201cWhat we can\u2019t do is suggest that a percentage of children \u2014 even if it\u2019s a small percentage of children \u2014 can\u2019t be protected.\u201dThe list of so-called special conditions to which Pok\u00e9mon Go was added includes prohibitions on parolees owning cameras or cellphones, using the internet or driving anywhere besides work. If parolees, who are subject to unscheduled searches of their home and devices, break any of these provisions, they could end up back in prison. Parole officers can grant dispensation on some of the conditions case by case.\u201cI think that the anonymity of apps like Kik, Snapchat, Instagram and Pok\u00e9mon Go does increase the risk for opportunistic offenders,\u201d she said.Finn Brunton, an assistant professor of media at New York University, described the game as part of a wave of new technology that is breaking down the boundary between real and virtual worlds in unpredictable ways. \u201cCyberspace \u2014 you think of it being this other place, but it\u2019s not that at all anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s the world that surrounds us.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In March, the companies unveiled a deal to lease G.M. vehicles to Lyft drivers. They also plan to collaborate on building a fleet of autonomous on-demand vehicles.Speculation about Lyft\u2019s future heated up in June when information emerged that the company had hired the Silicon Valley investment bank Qatalyst Partners, which was founded by Frank Quattrone. Qatalyst is known for helping clients find lucrative exits.Despite the mounting pressures, it\u2019s understandable that Lyft\u2019s founders, Logan Green and John Zimmer, would want to try to stay independent, at least for a while longer. G.M. has been investing heavily in driverless technology, but so have many of its peers, as well as the likes of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, and Apple. So there is no guarantee the carmaker will come up with a winning product.With software, rather than powertrain, a valuable component of autonomous vehicles, Lyft has little incentive to sell for anything other than top dollar. It would also presumably find it easier to recruit top programming talent as an independent company.Lyft may run out of road eventually. Being second to the much-larger Uber is a major disadvantage in an industry where drivers and riders prefer the largest, most active network. An expensive battle for ride-hailing supremacy would distract from the bigger prize: a chance to fundamentally disrupt car ownership with driverless technology \u2014 an opportunity Mr. Zimmer estimates is worth over $2 trillion per year in the United States alone, including the cost of buying, maintaining and insuring cars. That may ultimately direct Lyft to seek an off-ramp that leads to G.M. It just has to hope that when it does, G.M. is still willing to take the wheel.Advertisement"}
