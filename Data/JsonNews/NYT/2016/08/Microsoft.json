{"Headline": "When Every Company Is a Tech Company, Does the Label Matter?", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesApple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon have created something of a watershed moment in the stock market.They became the four most valuable companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index at the close of trading on Aug. 1, according to S.&P.\u2019s official tally. That meant that tech companies, by one common definition, occupied the four top spots in the market capitalization rankings, a rare and brief occurrence.\u201cIt may never have happened before at the close of trading,\u201d said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. The full history of daily rankings isn\u2019t readily available, however, so we can\u2019t be certain, and such rankings are evanescent, shifting with every tick of the stock market. In fact, on Friday, Amazon dropped back into sixth place.But no matter: The early August rankings were a reminder of how far tech has come. It is a dominant force in the stock market and the economy, one so all-encompassing that tech may no longer even be a useful concept for understanding today\u2019s stock market.One of them is Exxon Mobil, the energy giant and the most valuable company in the S.&P. as recently as 2012. But Exxon Mobil has been cut down in size by the oil price debacle. The other is Berkshire Hathaway, Warren E. Buffett\u2019s conglomerate, which the S.&P. categorizes as a financial services company \u2014 the only such company left in the Top 10 market cap list. Berkshire announced its own earnings after trading closed on Friday. We\u2019ll soon learn whether the market is pleased enough to vault Berkshire further ahead of Amazon.The three tech companies at the very top in market cap \u2014 Apple, Google and Microsoft \u2014 have held high positions for a long while. (Google, ranked second, trades as Alphabet, the name of its parent company.) Google passed Apple in value briefly this year, but Apple regained the top perch, which it has held since 2012. Microsoft, now No. 3, was the most valuable company during the last tech boom, in the early 2000s.Virtually no one disputes S.&P.\u2019s formal classification of Apple, Google and Microsoft as \u201cinformation technology\u201d companies. The same is true of Facebook, which held seventh place in the latest list of most valuable companies. But while Amazon is often described as a tech company \u2014 and undoubtedly uses and creates innovative technology \u2014 S.&P. has never classified it as one.In fact, Amazon is formally known as a \u201cconsumer discretionary company,\u201d like Walmart, which it has displaced as a member of the Top 10 most valuable companies. Amazon is the only consumer discretionary company left in the Top 10. Is it in some sense a tech company? Certainly, and we\u2019ll get back to that.But the same can be said, to one degree or another, about the three other members of the Top 10 \u2014 old companies that are still prospering in large part because of their mastery of advanced technologies. Johnson & Johnson, for example, which is ranked eighth, is a health care company, yet it is heavily involved in technology of a biological kind. Then there is General Electric, the diversified industrial company (and, until recently, also a financial services company), once described as a bellwether for the entire market. It conducts advanced research and sells tech products.Last on the list is AT&T, a telecommunications company, which, in an early form, helped create computer languages and operating systems on which modern tech companies are built. In 1957, when the S.&P. 500 was born, an ancestral version of AT&T was the most valuable company in the United States by a very wide margin, said Jeremy J. Siegel, a Wharton business school professor, the author of \u201cStocks for the Long Run\u201d and a market historian.\u201cAT&T back then was a highly regulated old phone company,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a giant, later broken up into smaller companies. And it was an outlier, because the other big companies in the S.&P. 500 in that era were mainly materials companies \u2014 like United States Steel, DuPont and Union Carbide \u2014 and an awful lot of oil companies.\u201dIn 1957, the economy ran on oil, and the biggest energy company was Standard Oil of New Jersey \u2014 an ancestor of Exxon Mobil. No pure tech company ranked in the Top 10 back then, not even IBM, which soon became the dominant tech company, a position it held until Microsoft surpassed it in the mid-1990s. That was the decade of the great tech boom, culminating in the bubble that burst in March 2000. Microsoft was No. 1 in market cap at the end of 1999, and four other tech companies \u2014 Cisco Systems, Intel, IBM and America Online \u2014 were also among the Top 10 most valuable companies. The stock market celebrated tech\u2019s ascendance then, as it does now.But this is a different era. When you dig deeper into the S.&P. 500, it\u2019s clear that while the valuations of tech companies swelled to unrealistically high proportions in those bubble years, the valuations of most companies are far more modest now. In March 2000, the height of the bubble, the value of information technology companies swelled to 34.5 percent of the total market cap of the S.&P. 500. At the moment, the comparable figure is only 20.7 percent, data from the Bespoke Investment Group shows. That\u2019s not much more than the 15.7 percent share of financial companies or the 15.2 percent share of the health care sector. By contrast, finance ballooned as high as 22.3 percent at the end of 2006, in what can be seen in hindsight as a financial bubble.On the other hand, materials and energy companies, which together constituted almost half of the total value of the S.&P. 500 in 1957, now account for less than 10 percent of it. That reflects the collapse of energy and commodity prices over the last few years, and it may well be a temporary phenomenon. In the meantime, diversified energy companies like Exxon Mobil are investing heavily in technology, a necessity if they are to flourish.It\u2019s clear even to energy companies, in other words, that tech\u2019s abiding power in the marketplace is not temporary. Technology permeates every sector of the economy, even those not formally classified as high-tech. Whether companies like Amazon and Johnson & Johnson should carry tech labels is beside the point. Tech has already taken over.These days every company is a tech company, but some have better niches, faster growth, more attractive offerings or more favorable share prices than others. These kinds of fundamental distinctions will influence the Top 10 rankings of the future.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

She wanted character, not shiny out of the box. Some of the cymbals she got were grimy with age and water spots that hinted of concerts in the rain. Others were chipped, dinged and dented.\u201cYou walk through space and you have cause and effect,\u201d she said.But like Mr. Allen himself, who has fingerprints on much of the city\u2019s explosion of growth, geekiness only touches the surface.Now his passion for art, as a collector and benefactor, is resonating too. The fair, which featured 84 galleries from locations as varied as New York, Los Angeles, Seoul and Miami \u2014 up from 60 in its first year \u2014 drew more than 15,000 visitors last year, and had about 18,000 by the fair\u2019s close on Sunday.What the fair says about Seattle, and whether its art community was sufficiently represented, with 18 Pacific Northwest galleries on the roster \u2014 and only 10 from Seattle \u2014 remains a continuing debate.\u201cIf there\u2019s going to be all this energy, and all these collectors coming in from out of town, and critics and press talking about it, we can either, as an art community, sit on the sideline and watch the spectacle, or we can participate and ride that wave. I\u2019m not one to sit out a big opportunity,\u201d said Greg Lundgren, Out of Sight\u2019s founder.\u201cPeople are really trying to rise to the occasion,\u201d said Kirsten Anderson, Roq La Rue\u2019s owner and founder. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard as much complaining this year,\u201d she added.Carl and Jeannette Pergam, both retired physicians who were visiting the fair from a Seattle suburb, said they were struck by the high prices, which they said spoke to them partly about the art\u2019s quality, but also about the wave of wealth in Seattle from the explosion of growth at technology companies like Amazon and Microsoft.\u201cThe ones I would put up on my wall are sparse,\u201d said Ms. Vartanian, 47, a cancer researcher who lives in Seattle. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of important work here.\u201dMr. Allen said in an interview that he pushed no particular vision of what the fair should be about, but that he likes the interplay of intellect and emotion.\u201cThere\u2019s always this interesting tension between fairly intellectual pursuits like science, and more visceral pursuits like art, and how they respond and bond to each other,\u201d he said. He also deeply appreciates, he added, the simple joy of the unexpected.Laura Fried, the Seattle Art Fair\u2019s artistic director, said that she gravitated to what the artists were trying to say about the connection between technology and modern life.\u201cThe conceptual underpinnings are more what I find interesting,\u201d she said.\u201cThe way that we are arranging our world is changing, with digital space merging with physical space,\u201d she said. \u201cI really love thinking about softness in public.\u201dMs. Kasper said she thought about the human stories behind the objects in assembling her cymbals project. Her fantasy was that a musician would walk through \u201cStar Formation,\u201d recognize some well-worn cymbal that he or she once owned, pull her aside and tell her a great back story about the night it got cracked.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cloud Computing Brings Sprawling Centers, but Few Jobs, to Small Towns", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBoydton JournalBOYDTON, Va. \u2014 A giant Microsoft facility just outside this very small town hides behind a quarter-mile berm and a guard house, across the highway from the rubble of a demolished prison.Behind the berm, six unmarked hangars each hold tens of thousands of computer servers. Microsoft has cleared enough scrub trees and vines for at least 15 of these buildings, and six more are already under construction.One thing there isn\u2019t much of at this Microsoft complex, one single computer data center, is long-term work. Microsoft says it might have \u201cseveral dozen\u201d employees in a place like this. They are mostly elite computer workers who tend not to come from Boydton, which lost a lot of good jobs when nearby factories closed and the prison shut down.So it is in a number of small towns across the country, as technology giants like Amazon, Google and Microsoft race to build networks of unprecedented size to provide services over the internet, a technology trend known as cloud computing. Local people, along with many economists and officials, often think these data centers are a key to an industrial revival. But the reality is less impressive.\u201cI\u2019ve worked on a lot of nuclear power plants, and these things are a lot bigger than that,\u201d said E. W. Gregory, the head of the local electrical workers\u2019 union. But \u201cthe first thing they put in was a guard shack and a fence. I\u2019ve filled rooms with people looking for entry-level work. None of it lasts.\u201dThe companies come to places like Boydton for basics like land, water and electricity. Even with low local wages, people are a high-cost item. As small as the staffs at these mammoth facilities are, companies say, perhaps a third of the company jobs will eventually be filled by robots.Google started building in eastern Oregon to be near cheap hydroelectric power on the Columbia River, and most recently it has focused on Iowa, Alabama and Tennessee. Microsoft has a center in Wyoming, and it bought a nine-hole golf course as part of a complex near West Des Moines, Iowa. Amazon recently built similar giant facilities on the outer reaches of Columbus, Ohio, and Dulles, Va.\u201cA lot of this stuff is put in rural parts of the country that used to be part of a manufacturing economy\u201d that has gone overseas, said Bill Coughran, a partner at the venture investment firm Sequoia Capital who ran much of Google\u2019s big engineering for eight years. \u201cTextiles and furniture created a big power grid in the south. Then those jobs went away.\u201dThat\u2019s been the story for Boydton, population 430, in the middle of tobacco country a few miles from the North Carolina border. The prison across from the Microsoft center closed in 2012. A nearby Burlington Industries textile plant that employed more than 2,000 shut in 2002. It was razed in 2012.The South Virginia tobacco economy collapsed as Americans cut back on smoking. But in 1999, Virginia used some of the $4.1 billion it received in a settlement with cigarette makers to build high-speed fiber-optic lines throughout the region.The broadband drew Microsoft, along with some financial perks. Mecklenburg County, which received $2.1 million from the state for the project, has given Microsoft 350 acres and offset personal property taxes by 82.5 percent, according to Wayne Carter, the county administrator.Initially, Apple, which is building a big cloud center for consumers\u2019 photos and music, wanted the Boydton site, but it went across the border to North Carolina, which promised tax breaks on its data center equipment. Not to be outdone, Virginia passed laws in 2009 and 2010 that exempted sales taxes on things like data center computer servers, software, power generators and chillers to cool all that equipment.\u201cWe\u2019ve had six years of construction work,\u201d said Mr. Carter. That has helped the county, he said, because even temporary workers rent houses, stay in hotels and eat in local restaurants.Microsoft did not dispute reports that it would spend $1.1 billion on the Boydton data center, and said that \u201con average, data centers employ tens to several dozen people,\u201d in a mixture of corporate and contracted positions. It declined to let a reporter tour the site.\u201cThey talked about 100 jobs, but it\u2019s a slow process,\u201d said Thomas C. Coleman III, the mayor of Boydton. So far, he says, the biggest impact \u201chas been a couple of lunch tables at the Triangle gas station.\u201dHe understates matters, but not by much. Mr. Gregory, the electrician, said his union had hundreds of applicants for work digging ditches and laying pipe, starting at $10.88 an hour. Wiring paid $28.59. Both jobs tended to last about six months, he said, with lots of attrition for the hard outdoor labor.Working as a security guard or as someone testing the wires inside the data center offers better money, but there are not many positions. Microsoft prefers to fly in its own specialists for some work, and it doesn\u2019t like hiring people who have worked in other big companies\u2019 cloud-computing centers, Mr. Gregory said. (Microsoft said it did not exclude candidates based on previous experience.)\u201cWe can provide a place to live, but all those contractors will move on to the next town where they\u2019re building,\u201d Mr. Coleman said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you can count on.\u201dThe big cloud networks are immensely profitable for the few companies who can operate these global systems. The biggest three cloud companies estimate that the global market in business computing is worth $1 trillion or more, and they are rushing to expand globally. In interviews, all said they spend more than $2 billion annually on this.\u201cIt\u2019s phenomenal how rapidly they are growing,\u201d said Erik Brynjolfsson, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has written extensively on the impact of new technologies. \u201cIt is the key enabler of all kinds of technology advances, starting with the things companies do now, but lots cheaper, including outsourcing tech jobs.\u201dThat is hard to imagine in places where local roots go so deep. Conversations here usually start with people explaining where they are from, and what their families did here for generations. \u201cBoydton is the quintessential quaint courthouse town,\u201d said Leigh Lambert, the town librarian. \u201cPeople from here love it. It feels like it\u2019s always with you.\u201dMs. Lambert grew up nearby, tried New York, and returned to work next to the court, which is adorned with a statue of a Confederate soldier. Microsoft initially came to a couple of town meetings, and it seemed to offer a way Boydton could come back. \u201cNow they\u2019re off by themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cWe hear they have a really nice Starbucks machine.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "G.E., the 124-Year-Old Software Start-Up", "Date": "2016-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt may not qualify as a lightning-bolt eureka moment, but Jeffrey R. Immelt, chief executive of General Electric, recalls the June day in 2009 that got him thinking. He was speaking with G.E. scientists about new jet engines they were building, laden with sensors to generate a trove of data from every flight \u2014 but to what end?That data could someday be as valuable as the machinery itself, if not more so. But G.E. couldn\u2019t make use of it.But in 2011, G.E. also quietly opened a software center in San Ramon, Calif., 24 miles east of San Francisco, across the bay.Today one of San Ramon\u2019s most important projects is to build a computer operating system, but on an industrial scale \u2014 a Microsoft Windows or Google Android for factories and industrial equipment. The project is central to G.E.\u2019s drive to become what Mr. Immelt says will be a \u201ctop 10 software company\u201d by 2020.Silicon Valley veterans are skeptical.Many industries see digital threats, of course. Yet the scope of the challenge is magnified at G.E., a 124-year-old company and the nation\u2019s largest manufacturer, with more than 300,000 employees worldwide. Employees companywide have been making pilgrimages to San Ramon for technology briefings, but also to soak in the culture. Their marching orders are to try to adapt the digital wizardry and hurry-up habits of Silicon Valley to G.E.\u2019s world of industrial manufacturing.6 PhotosG.E.\u2019s success or failure over the next decade, Mr. Immelt says, depends on this transformation. He calls it \u201cprobably the most important thing I\u2019ve worked on in my career.\u201dApparently, there is no Plan B. \u201cIt\u2019s this or bust,\u201d he said.The march of digital technology \u2014 mainly inexpensive sensors, powerful computing and clever software \u2014 into the industrial world has been underway for years under the guise of \u201cthe internet of things\u201d or \u201cthe industrial internet.\u201d It is the next battlefield as companies fight to develop the dominant software layer that connects the machines.It promises to be a huge market for new products, improved service and efficiency gains in industries like energy, transportation and health care. By 2020, the industrial internet market will reach $225 billion, G.E. executives predicted in a recent meeting with analysts.So far, a major application has been predictive maintenance. Software analyzes the data generated by a machine to identify early warning signals that it needs repair, before it breaks down.The data volumes are exploding as machines new and old spawn sensors. By 2020, G.E. estimates that the data flowing off its machines in use will jump a hundredfold. That should enable far more detailed analysis, giving G.E. a chance to sell its customers not machines but \u201cbusiness outcomes,\u201d like fuel savings. Mr. Immelt sees this as a move up the industrial food chain.Yet all of this exposes G.E. to new competition beyond its traditional rivals like Rockwell Automation, Siemens and United Technologies. Tech giants, including Amazon, Cisco, Google, IBM and Microsoft also have their eye on the industrial internet market, as do a bevy of start-ups.There is precedent for trouble in other industries, of course. Google and Facebook transformed media and advertising, Amazon redefined retailing, and Uber applied an entirely new business model to taxis, which hadn\u2019t changed much in generations.\u201cThe real danger is that the data and analysis becomes worth more than the installed equipment itself,\u201d said Karim R. Lakhani, a professor at the Harvard Business School. \u201cG.E. has no choice but to try to do that itself.\u201dUntil this year, Darren Haas hadn\u2019t thought about G.E., certainly not working there. To him, G.E. meant little more than than kitchen appliances and light bulbs. \u201cI had no idea,\u201d Mr. Haas said.But he was intrigued after he met with Harel Kodesh, an expert in mobile and cloud computing who led teams at Microsoft and VMware, a maker of data-center software. Less than two years ago, Mr. Kodesh joined G.E., and he is now chief technology officer of GE Digital.That someone of Mr. Kodesh\u2019s caliber was a G.E. convert got Mr. Haas\u2019s attention. Then, Mr. Haas started grasping the role that G.E. equipment plays across the economy \u2014 in transportation, in hospitals \u2014 \u201ca whole world,\u201d he said. \u201cI found that really, really compelling.\u201dThe other thing Mr. Haas, 41, found appealing was the big computing challenge that lies ahead for the company. In May, he joined G.E. from Apple, where he was a member of the founding team at Siri, the voice-based digital assistant start-up Apple acquired in 2010. When he left Apple, Mr. Haas was head of cloud engineering, managing the computing engine behind Siri, iTunes and iCloud.At GE Digital, Mr. Haas has a similar title, head of platform cloud engineering, but in a different setting. He describes his job as applying modern software technology \u2014 machine learning, artificial intelligence and cloud computing \u2014 to the industrial arena. \u201cI\u2019ve got my work cut out for me,\u201d he said.Mr. Haas is working on the centerpiece of G.E.\u2019s software strategy, a product called Predix. Its evolution mirrors G.E.\u2019s software ambitions.Predix began as little more than a brand of software used by G.E. to service the gear it sells. One showcase use was in jet engines to do predictive maintenance, saving downtime. Around 2013, William Ruh, a former Cisco Systems executive brought in to put together the San Ramon software center, started expanding Predix to other G.E. industrial businesses.But that soon felt too small. The issue was \u201coutside disrupters,\u201d Mr. Ruh said, citing the online lodging start-up Airbnb as an example of rivals that can appear seemingly out of nowhere and that \u201cbring greater productivity \u2014 but don\u2019t own the assets they sell.\u201d G.E., Mr. Ruh notes, is the ultimate big-asset company.The other threat was rising interest among tech companies to take their internet connectivity expertise and try to apply it to industrial businesses. To get ahead of all this, G.E. reimagined Predix as a cloud-based operating system for industrial applications.Mr. Kodesh leads that effort. He ticks off the looming competitors: Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and others. \u201cThose companies are going to encroach on the territory,\u201d Mr. Kodesh said. \u201cAre we going to capitulate, or build something like Predix?\u201dThe basic idea is that G.E. and outside software developers will write programs to run on Predix. This software might, for instance, monitor the health and fine-tune the operation of equipment like oil-field rigs and wind-farm turbines, improving performance, reducing wear and adapting to changing environmental conditions. It amounts to software delivering the equivalent of personalized medicine for machines.Like any other computer operating system, Predix aims to take the complexity out of writing programs, so more people can create them. And while the instincts of the industrial world are proprietary, G.E. is following an open-source model with Predix, providing a basic design, but one open to outside contributors \u2014 more like Android from Google than Windows from Microsoft.Predix, Mr. Kodesh said, will be improved using the software equivalent of Lego blocks. \u201cSome will be G.E.\u2019s, and some will be made by third-party developers,\u201d he said.G.E. is betting that its deep knowledge of industry will give it an edge in this software arms race. The stakes for this kind of programming can be high.For a regular consumer using the internet, a misfiring algorithm in the software \u2014 \u201ca false positive\u201d \u2014 might mean a person sees an irrelevant online ad, or a bad Amazon book suggestion or Netflix movie recommendation, Mr. Kodesh said. Useless, perhaps, but not necessarily costly. But a false positive that prompts an airline to take a jet engine off the wing, Mr. Kodesh said, is a $100,000 mistake.\u201cWe really do need to have different technology, different algorithms and a different cloud, than in the consumer internet,\u201d he said.G.E. has set an ambitious target for Predix. It hopes to attract $100 million in orders this year, on its way to $4 billion in revenue by 2020. By then, the company forecasts that its total digital business \u2014 more than 90 percent of it software \u2014 may reach as much as $15 billion, up from $6 billion now.For Predix to reach its potential, though, G.E. needs outside programmers to write software for it. The company, with its deep pockets, can start the software-writing parade, but will others follow?This will be a major test. And G.E.\u2019s campaign to build an industrial operating system and create a flourishing ecosystem of software for it is just getting underway in earnest.In late July, G.E. hosted a Predix conference in Las Vegas, which attracted 1,200 software developers. Such developer gatherings are part of the playbook of every major software company but unusual for an industrial corporation.G.E. has some built-in advantages. Its installed base is huge. For example, the company says more than a third of the world\u2019s electricity is generated on G.E. equipment. It can make progress simply by winning over the aircraft makers, oil companies, hospitals and utilities that now depend on G.E. machinery.G.E. is starting to attract a developer following. Tata Consultancy Services, for one, says it now has 500 programmers designing and developing Predix applications for customers in the electric-utility, aviation and health care industries. G.E. also promotes partnerships with Infosys, Wipro and Capgemini to help business write Predix software.When he joined in 2011, Mr. Ruh had no illusions that making software a strength at a heavy-industry company would be easy. At the time, he told Mr. Immelt that would be \u201ca 10-year journey,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of that journey.\u201dPart of that is an effort to change an engineering culture that stretches back generations. \u201cIf G.E. is truly going to be a digital-industrial company, we can\u2019t be separate here,\u201d Mr. Ruh said of his software division. Digital \u201ctools and habits\u201d need to be embedded \u201cin how people do their jobs,\u201d he said.In its factory in Greenville, S.C., G.E. produces both giant power generators and evidence that this metamorphosis might work.The three-story building is crowded with immense cranes and milling, grinding and welding machines, overseen by manufacturing engineers and technicians. The finishing touches are being put on one of G.E.\u2019s new gas turbines.It looks like the business end of a rocket ship lying on its side, a gleaming steel dynamo at rest. It weighs 950,000 pounds. It fires up at nearly 2,900 degrees Fahrenheit, and it can generate enough electricity to supply more than 500,000 households.The gas turbine was brought to market in half the typical five years. That kind of accelerated product development is a performance that G.E. hopes to replicate across its industrial businesses. And it is a story of changes in design and manufacturing practices made possible by digital technology.John Lammas, the 56-year-old vice president for power generation engineering, started his working career 40 years ago, on the shop floor of a Rolls-Royce jet engine factory in Birmingham, England. He has been with G.E. for 31 years, moving up the ranks of the company\u2019s jet engine and power turbine divisions.\u201cI\u2019m an old mechanical guy,\u201d he said. But a couple of years ago, he issued an edict: no more paper drawings.In the past, a model of a new part would be made and then converted to detailed blueprints running to 70 pages or more. These would then be physically sent to G.E. manufacturing engineers and outside suppliers to begin setting up the tooling, casting and cutting for the part.This prototype-and-blueprint routine took up to eight weeks. Now, engineers use 3-D computer models, skip the prototype step and instantly send the models electronically.This goes a step beyond computer-aided design, which is commonplace. In Greenville, the designers are for the first time linked directly with manufacturers and suppliers in real time, in what G.E. calls a \u201cdigital thread.\u201d This means they can collaborate in ways that have changed the work process while making it more likely that problems or defects are spotted sooner.Traditionally, one set of engineers designed a part, and only then passed it on to manufacturing. If a problem arose on the supplier side, the design was kicked back and the process started over. \u201cJobs are combining in this digital world,\u201d Mr. Lammas said.Greenville\u2019s own equipment has been a Predix guinea pig. The machinery and factory were retrofitted with data-generating sensors and the software. Matt Krause, the plant manager, said that last winter, when a snowstorm shut the factory for a day, the sensor network detected that the plant had consumed 1,000 pounds of argon, an inert gas used in coatings for parts. The leak was fixed, saving $350,000 a year.\u201cWe can see things we never did before,\u201d Mr. Krause said. Over all, 60 of 200 steps in design and production have been automated or eliminated, reducing work time by 530,000 hours over three years, G.E. estimates.Not all the start-up ideas that G.E. is trying to breed translate comfortably to heavy industry. Lean proponents urge companies to come up with \u201cminimum viable products,\u201d particularly test versions of software programs. But no one wants a minimum viable jet engine or power generator.Yet in Greenville, engineers in the design stages are encouraged to move faster in smaller steps, conduct more experiments, and be willing to fail and try again. It amounts to a sea change in the engineering culture of heavy industry.\u201cAs an engineer, not getting it right the first time, I find painful,\u201d said Bill Byrne, an engineering manager. \u201cIt\u2019s uncomfortable. But it\u2019s been incredibly liberating.\u201dThe old ways, said Mr. Lammas, the engineering chief, had merit. Each step and rule was logical on its own. But the emphasis on flawless execution and perfection fostered a fear of failure. \u201cOvercoming that culture was probably the biggest challenge,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

If Rackspace\u2019s strategic shift to sell services on these platforms succeeds, Apollo will have a nice payday.About 70 percent of Rackspace\u2019s revenue comes from managing server farms for individual companies. That is a stable but relatively low-growth business. The excitement has come from its public cloud operations, where it competes against Amazon Web Services and Microsoft\u2019s Azure, selling on-demand computing and services.The problem is this is a business of scale. Bigger companies can negotiate to buy servers and power for less, and deploy gear more effectively. So Amazon and Microsoft can offer better deals to customers without suffering a big hit to margins.Rackspace is trying a bit of jujitsu. While it is not abandoning its efforts, the company realizes it cannot effectively compete with Amazon and Microsoft. So it has become a partner, selling services and helping companies connect their data and software to Amazon Web Services and Azure. There is an additional benefit to Apollo. It takes a lot less capital to offer consulting services than to build and run server farms.There is risk. While its existing business of managing server farms for individual businesses probably will provide enough cash flow to cover costs and service debt, success will rely on its new partnerships taking off. That may not happen. Customers may wonder whether it makes sense to pay for additional support and services, especially as Amazon and Microsoft continually make their web services easier to use. The growth of cloud computing, however, may mean there\u2019s plenty of room on the Amazon and Microsoft bandwagons.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Giants Gobble Start-Ups in an Antitrust Blind Spot", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDeal ProfessorLike Facebook\u2019s acquisition of WhatsApp, the Walmart deal will probably end up being another example of an upstart internet company being swallowed up to preserve the stranglehold of a giant.This happens because antitrust regulators are stuck in an outdated view of the world, while the internet giants are more attuned to their nascent competitive threats. The deal for Jet.com is just the latest defensive internet acquisition of an emerging start-up that will preserve the hegemony of a select few.And now it is being swallowed up by Walmart.This could be seen as a victory for competition. Walmart will now have a more dynamic management and brand to buttress its own internet sales operation, which trails Amazon by quite a distance. This will allow it to better compete against Amazon. The likely result is that competition in online retailing will eventually be a slugfest between Amazon and Walmart with everyone else thrown by the wayside.The problem with this narrative is that it cements the positions of Walmart and Amazon as the only players in town.This is the modus operandi of the big internet behemoths. They live in fear of new technology disrupting their businesses and killing them off.Mr. Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez was a Facebook product manager when the company faced its greatest threat: Google Plus. Facebook won because it enforced an ethos of all work, all the time, spurred by constant fear of extinction.Facebook and its elite brethren will do anything to make sure they are not the next Yahoo or Radio Shack, killed by disruption and failure to innovate. This translates into paying obscene sums for technology that might challenge their dominance one day.If you don\u2019t believe this, there is a poignant passage in \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d where Mr. Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez notes that Mark Zuckerberg saw that there were two companies with \u201chockey stick growth\u201d that matched Facebook\u2019s own: Instagram and WhatsApp. Both were amassing users at an amazing rate and both were an existential threat to Facebook.Did Mr. Zuckerberg rev up the Facebook machine to try to outcompete them? No. Instead, he bought Instagram for about $1 billion and WhatsApp for an astounding $21.8 billion.Today, Facebook is dominant, with more than 1.7 billion monthly active users. WhatsApp has more than 1 billion monthly active users and Instagram, more than 500 million.Another Google example is YouTube, which was bought for $1.65 billion in 2006 and is now a constant stream of users for Google. Indeed, YouTube, with more than one billion active monthly users, is a top driver of Alphabet\u2019s user growth.Billions of dollars are made in Silicon Valley by selling nascent upstarts to the giants. And the dominant players pay eagerly to remain dominant. That is what is going on with the Jet.com acquisition and perhaps even the $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn by Microsoft.Where are the antitrust authorities in all of this? The guiding standard under the law is that no acquisition should be allowed if it would \u201clessen competition.\u201dUnder the traditional view of antitrust, when Facebook, for example, tries to buy a company like Instagram, it can argue that anyone can start such a website. And there are other competitors like Google and Snapchat. And so this gets past the antitrust authorities, who seem more concerned with how the data will be used rather than the accumulation of users. Both United States and European Union regulators examined the WhatsApp deal, but it passed muster because WhatsApp was viewed as a messenger service, something where there was alternative competition.This misses the point that domination is all about users and views. Those companies with users and page views can dominate, and accumulating those users is everything, something only an infinitesimally small number of companies can find the key to doing.The antitrust system results in the increasing oligopoly that we have, where a few companies dominate major industries, accruing the wealth and power that go with it as potential disrupters are swallowed at birth, the way Cronus, the titan in Greek mythology, ate his young to prevent their uprising.No one knows what might happen to Jet if it remained independent. Perhaps it would fail. Amazon is dominant and Walmart may truly be the only real competitor. The same could be said of any of these acquisitions of high-growth companies. So preventing this acquisition may result not in creating a competitor to Amazon but in the eventual death of Jet. This of course would leave its founder and investors much poorer, a true cost.The flip side of this risk is that the big tech companies continue unchallenged in their dominance. Perhaps it is time to rethink antitrust enforcement, and take the risks associated with a different view of antitrust that looks at potential dominance and at breaking up oligopolies. Rhea protected Zeus from Cronus, which eventually led to Cronus\u2019s destruction.If antitrust authorities do not adapt and emerging competitors continue to be bought up, we should not be surprised of the continued dominance of a very few companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Walmart.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Duo Makes Video Calling Between Operating Systems Easier", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "Supported byTech FixGoogle and Apple have battled each other for years for primacy over mobile users. Apple has proferred its superior devices, like the iPhone. Google has fought back with its Android operating system and a series of mobile apps that are more flexible and compatible with a broader set of devices than Apple\u2019s apps.The app fits squarely into Google\u2019s playbook in mobile. Over the last few years, Google has increasingly offered its important software and internet services, including Google Maps, Google Photos and Google Docs, to iPhone customers. All of those apps were compelling alternatives to Apple\u2019s proprietary apps, like Apple Maps, Photos and Notes, because they work on a wider variety of devices, including Macs, Windows PCs, Android devices and iPhones.Duo is no exception. People can only use FaceTime to call others who have Apple devices. But Duo lets you place video calls between Android and iPhone users, and sizably increases the universe of people with whom you can hold a video conversation.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to worry about whether your call will connect, or if your friend is using the same type of device as you are,\u201d Google said in a statement, in a veiled jab at Apple. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder that nearly half of U.S. adults never make video calls on mobile.\u201dAll of this feeds into Google\u2019s strategy to attract iPhone users over to Android. Google\u2019s apps generally work better on Android devices than on iPhones, so the more that people get hooked on Google\u2019s core apps, the less incentive there is to stay loyal to Apple.Nick Fox, Google\u2019s head of communication products, said the top priority with Duo was to build a great product and to increase the use of video calling among Android users. But he added that making Android more attractive to iPhone owners was a secondary motive. He said that Duo\u2019s appeal was that it was simple to use, fast and more widely accessible.\u201cOur view is video calling should work for everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can only call half the people you know, that\u2019s very limiting.\u201d\u201cOur year-to-date iPhone sales to switchers are the greatest we\u2019ve seen in any nine-month period,\u201d Mr. Cook said in the call, without disclosing precise figures.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment beyond Mr. Cook\u2019s comments.I decided to test Duo to see how the new app plays into the debate about whether iPhone users should consider switching to Android devices. After trying an early copy of Duo and comparing it side by side with FaceTime, I found that Duo was just as intuitive and fun to use as FaceTime, but that it was too early to tell which service was more reliable.A Short HistoryThis is not the first time Google has provided video calling. Google started offering mobile video calling several years ago inside its Hangouts app, which also includes messaging and voice-calling capabilities. The video-calling feature in Hangouts will remain intact.Crystal Dahlen, a Google spokeswoman, said the name Duo conveyed that the app was designed for one-to-one video calling on mobile devices, in contrast to Hangouts, which lets groups of people make video calls over mobile devices and computers. Duo will roll out globally over the next few days.FaceTime, in contrast, is now six years old. When Apple unveiled the video-calling ability in iPhones in 2010, Steven P. Jobs, Apple\u2019s co-founder, said he had dreamed of mobile video calling since he grew up watching \u201cThe Jetsons\u201d and \u201cStar Trek.\u201d Apple later expanded FaceTime to work with iPads and Macs, among other Apple products. The company has not published statistics on FaceTime use, but the technology helped make mobile video calling mainstream.Duo Versus FaceTimeThe Duo app is downloadable and free through Google\u2019s Play store and Apple\u2019s App Store. When you open the Duo app, there is just one button: video call. Tapping that loads your contacts list, and from there you can choose whom to call.Duo starts streaming video to a recipient as soon as the call is placed, meaning the person you are calling will be able to see you waving or making faces before he or she picks up. Google calls this feature Knock Knock. It can be disabled in case you have friends who are likely to make inappropriate hand gestures.With FaceTime, you place a call directly through the iPhone\u2019s contacts list or through the separate FaceTime app. The recipient does not see the video streaming until after the call is answered.I placed video calls over Duo and FaceTime over a strong Wi-Fi connection as well as a weak cellular connection. In the tests, the video calls looked clearer on Duo, though that is an unreliable measure because very few people are currently able to use Duo, so the network is unrealistically uncongested. When more people use Duo, we can expect the picture quality to vary depending on network traffic and internet speeds.There is a minor difference for Duo between Android and iPhone users. An Android user receiving a Duo call will see a Knock Knock video on the home screen by default. Those using Apple devices will see a notification on top of the screen and will have to open the Duo app before seeing Knock Knock in action. Otherwise, the app works the same for both Android and iPhone.Against the RestI also compared Duo calls with video calls placed over Microsoft\u2019s Skype and Facebook Messenger. Against those two, Duo\u2019s simplicity won hands down.In Facebook\u2019s Messenger app, the video-calling feature is embedded in the corner of a message box, so it is hard to find and not intuitive to use. In fact, every call I have ever made with Messenger has been by mistake.On Skype, the video-calling feature is in a place similar to Messenger\u2019s, in the corner of a message box. More annoyingly, to find other Skype users you have to manually add them to your Skype contacts list or toggle on an option to synchronize your address book with Skype.The Bottom LineFor now, FaceTime is just as intuitive as Duo so I see no compelling reason to use Duo over FaceTime to call iPhone users.But if I had to video call an Android user, I would use Duo over other video-calling services like Skype or Facebook Messenger, which have more cluttered interfaces than Duo\u2019s single-button approach.Advertisement"}

Apple\u2019s new suite of operating systems appears to replace its pistol emoji, which was an image of a six-shooter, with a squirt gun.Apple\u2019s change is ill considered because it breaks the conceptual compatibility that Unicode is meant to establish. Anyone with an iPhone ought to be able to send a message to someone with another company\u2019s products \u2014 like Google or Microsoft or Samsung \u2014 and have what\u2019s delivered communicate the same idea as what\u2019s sent. But with this change, a squirt gun sent from an iPhone will turn into a handgun when received by an Android device, and vice versa.Those behind the campaign to remove the gun from the phone do not appear to be relying on arguments about kids\u2019, or everyone else\u2019s, malleability. Rather, they have portrayed it as a traditional grass-roots messaging campaign: \u201cBy removing the gun emoji,\u201d they write, \u201cwe\u2019ll show America wants stricter access to real guns.\u201d Apple is surely free to favor gun control as a matter of corporate policy \u2014 but it should not be tinkering with our right to express either that or a contrary view on worldwide platforms.It need not be this way. Rather, our devices already enable tech-savvy individuals to invent new emoji-like graphics to send their friends \u2014 and that their friends in turn can pass on to others. Those that attain extensive use could then be standardized in a routine way through Unicode and made available to everyone.Apple, Microsoft, Google and other \u201cbig tech\u201d companies should not be placed in a position, which they themselves do not want, of having to decide which words or emojis do and don\u2019t represent their brand.

They were the catalysts for Facebook\u2019s partnership to build classroom software with Summit Public Schools.Facebook is out to upend the traditional student-teacher relationship.Rather than have teachers hand out class assignments, the Facebook-Summit learning management system puts students in charge of selecting their projects and setting their pace. The idea is to encourage students to develop skills, like resourcefulness and time management, that might help them succeed in college.\u201cAs parents and kids and teachers get access to this type of learning, I think more and more will want it,\u201d Diane Tavenner, the co-founder and chief executive of Summit Public Schools, said in a telephone interview.But the Summit-Facebook system, called the \u201cSummit Personalized Learning Platform,\u201d is different.The software gives students a full view of their academic responsibilities for the year in each class and breaks them down into customizable lesson modules they can tackle at their own pace. A student working on a science assignment, for example, may choose to create a project using video, text or audio files. Students may also work asynchronously, tackling different sections of the year\u2019s work at the same time.The system inverts the traditional teacher-led classroom hierarchy, requiring schools to provide intensive one-on-one mentoring and coaching to help each student adapt.This summer, more than 1,500 educators and leaders of public, private and charter schools participating in the program, called Summit Basecamp, attended sessions to learn how to use the system. Among the 19 schools that introduced the new learning approach last year, at least a few educators and administrators reported a steep learning curve.\u201cThere were many points where we weren\u2019t sure the Summit Basecamp model was what our students needed,\u201d said Claire Fisher, the principal of Urban Promise Academy, a public middle school in Oakland, Calif., which introduced the platform in its sixth-grade classes.By the end of the school year, however, 31 percent of the school\u2019s sixth graders were reading at or above their grade level, compared with just 9 percent in the fall.

It wants the Alexa Voice Service, which powers Echo, to be an ingredient in devices around the home and beyond, even if they aren\u2019t made by Amazon.The vision of an omnipresent intelligent assistant is one Amazon shares, in one form or another, with most other big technology companies, including Apple, Google and Microsoft. Along with a handful of start-ups, these companies see their intelligent assistants as powerful new ways for users to interact with devices and internet services \u2014 just as smartphone touch screens were.Many technology specialists think that people will be O.K. with a single intelligent assistant in their lives but that most won\u2019t have the patience to regularly use two or three of them, each with its individual quirks. As a result, each company is racing to weave its assistant into as many devices and services as possible.\u201cWe\u2019re taking $180 worth of utility and adding it into a $200 device,\u201d he said.Ford Motor is working with Amazon to integrate Alexa into its vehicles so drivers can control smart-home features like lights, thermostats and security systems from their cars.Over 10,000 developers have registered to integrate Alexa into their products, Amazon said. It won\u2019t say how many Echo units it has sold, except to say that millions of devices with Alexa in them have been purchased.In an interview this spring, David Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for devices, said that the company wanted there to be as many Alexa-linked \u201cendpoints\u201d around the home as possible and that Amazon did not really care who made those devices. Amazon has expanded its lineup of devices that use Alexa with its Echo Dot, a miniature version of the Echo speaker, and Amazon Tap, a portable Bluetooth speaker.\u201cThe longer-term vision is a little bit like the \u2018Star Trek\u2019 computer,\u201d Mr. Limp said. \u201cCaptain Kirk or Picard could sit on the bridge and ask anything and get the right answer.\u201dBut while Amazon has made a lot of progress in this regard, it may have a hard time extending Alexa\u2019s reach outside the home because of its weaknesses in mobile technology, analysts say.The success of Echo has been described as a redemption of sorts for Amazon after it suffered a brutal defeat in the smartphone market with its Fire Phone, which the company stopped selling after poor sales \u2014 a misstep that has left Amazon vulnerable.Apple and Google have clear advantages over Amazon because of their dominant positions in the mobile market. And they are pushing their versions of Alexa \u2014 Siri and Google\u2019s assistant \u2014 as ways to control other devices throughout the home.As intelligent assistants improve in quality, Jan Dawson, an analyst at Jackdaw Research, thinks people will want these virtual helpers to follow them all day like a companion. \u201cWhat you want from an assistant is that they are always available to you everywhere,\u201d he said.While Amazon could eventually give people access to Alexa\u2019s functions through apps on smartphones (a couple of apps from independent developers do this already), Mr. Dawson is skeptical that Amazon will be able to make them work as well as assistants more deeply integrated into smartphones by Apple and Google.\u201cThey\u2019re basically absent on smartphones, which are devices we take everywhere we go,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Think Tanks Amplify Corporate America\u2019s Influence", "Date": "2016-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThis can become a productive, mutually beneficial relationship,\u201d Bruce Katz, a Brookings vice president, wrote to Lennar in July 2010. The ultimate benefit for Brookings: $400,000 in donations from Lennar\u2019s different divisions.\u201cHe would be a trusted adviser,\u201d an internal Brookings memo said in 2014 as the think tank sought one $100,000 donation from Lennar.Think tanks, which position themselves as \u201cuniversities without students,\u201d have power in government policy debates because they are seen as researchers independent of moneyed interests. But in the chase for funds, think tanks are pushing agendas important to corporate donors, at times blurring the line between researchers and lobbyists. And they are doing so while reaping the benefits of their tax-exempt status, sometimes without disclosing their connections to corporate interests.Similar arrangements exist at many think tanks. On issues as varied as military sales to foreign countries, international trade, highway management systems and real estate development, think tanks have frequently become vehicles for corporate influence and branding campaigns.The shift has occurred as nonprofits in general have been under increasing pressure from their donors to meet specific goals. But for think tanks, that pressure can threaten their standing as independent arbiters in policy debates in Congress, the White House and the news media.\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice to go back to the greatest generation, in the post-World War II era of philanthropy, where they said, gosh, \u2018Here is $1 million; spend it how you wish,\u2019\u201d Kimberly Churches, the managing director at Brookings, said in an interview.Think tank executives reject any suggestion that they are tools of corporate influence campaigns and say they are simply teaming up with donors that have similar goals, like helping cities with economic development.But he acknowledged that the arrangement to appoint the Lennar executive as a senior fellow had created the \u201cappearance of a conflict of interest.\u201d And he said that Brookings, in the interest of transparency, had recently decided to prohibit corporations or corporate-backed foundations from making anonymous contributions.Still, the benefits afforded to corporations looking to cloak themselves with the authority of think tanks are strikingly evident, according to a review of documents from more than a dozen institutions.The likely conclusions of some think tank reports, documents show, are discussed with donors \u2014 or even potential ones \u2014 before the research is complete. Drafts of the studies have been shared with donors whose opinions have then helped shape final reports. Donors have outlined how the resulting scholarship will be used as part of broader lobbying efforts. The think tanks also help donors promote their corporate brands, as Brookings does with JPMorgan Chase, whose $15.5 million contribution is the largest by a private corporation in the institution\u2019s history.Despite these benefits, corporations can write off the donations as charitable contributions. Some tax experts say these arrangements may amount to improper subsidies by taxpayers if think tanks are providing specific services.The Brookings Institution \u2014 long recognized as one of the most prestigious think tanks in the world \u2014 has aggressively courted corporate donors over the last decade, particularly for its Metropolitan Policy Program, which formed partnerships with JPMorgan Chase, Lennar Corporation, K.K.R., Hitachi and others. Here is an examination of the deals with these donors, based in part on thousands of pages of internal Brookings documents.Executives at Brookings, the Center for Strategic and International Studies and other think tanks say they have systems in place to ensure that their reports are based on scholars\u2019 independent conclusions.\u201c\u2018Are you going to say drones are bad?\u2019\u201d she recalled one potential financial backer asking. \u201c\u2018We are not interested in funding something that says drones are bad.\u2019\u201dThe confidential Brookings spreadsheet had an unassuming title: Corporate Overviews Tracking. It listed nearly 90 corporations, from Alcoa to Wells Fargo, providing a glimpse of the vast electronic file that Brookings maintained on donors and prospects, and the benefits it might offer.The database, along with thousands of pages of emails, solicitations for money and memos on meetings with corporate officials, highlighted Brookings\u2019s practice of assuring that donors would see results from their contributions.The files included company priorities and a tally of donations. General Electric wanted to fund work on rail networks and clean energy programs \u2014 both critical parts of its business \u2014 and Brookings then featured G.E. executives, joined by officials from the White House and Congress, at events that focused on these industries.From the start, the program blended a variety of insights on urban matters, including from corporate, nonprofit and government sources. And Mr. Indyk noted that any reports issued were made public.Donations to the program exploded, from $4.3 million in 2005 to $12.5 million in 2013, nearly 20 percent of Brookings\u2019s overall program spending that year.In advance of a 2014 event Brookings officials attended with corporate executives including Henry R. Kravis, a co-chairman of K.K.R., one memo marked as confidential noted: \u201cK.K.R. has given a total of $350K to Brookings. Last gift came in on 3/27/2014 for $150K to Metro; Henry has donated $75K to Brookings, most going to the individual unrestricted fund.\u201dThe tally demonstrates the important distinction that Brookings makes between \u201cunrestricted\u201d donations, which the think tank can spend on any research, and project-based funding restricted to specific topics that the donor has a particular interest in.The San Francisco project generated controversy from the beginning, with critics concerned about toxic waste left by the former Navy shipyard.A spokesman for Lennar, Glenn Bunting, disputed claims that the company had donated to Brookings out of self-interest \u2014 and said the alliance was not related to the protests.\u201cThere was nothing needed in the way of assistance for Lennar to \u2018buy\u2019 from Brookings,\u201d Mr. Bunting said in an email. Brookings, though, continued to promote the project.The think tank soon delivered.But Mr. Indyk acknowledged that naming Mr. Bonner, who declined to be interviewed, a Brookings nonresident scholar had \u201ccreated the impression that because Lennar was giving money, he was getting the title.\u201d His post, which was unpaid, was not renewed.Officials at Brookings said they had not lobbied for Hitachi, and they provided examples of reports that they said included conclusions challenging the company\u2019s position. \u201cHelping a corporation\u2019s for-profit agenda is not in any way our agenda,\u201d Ms. Churches, the managing director, said.Yet Ms. Churches also said the contract language with donors like Lennar and Hitachi was \u201cinelegant,\u201d although not improper.When asked if the documents read like a fee-for-service agreement, she said, \u201cIt could be misconstrued.\u201dMr. Indyk said Brookings had recently changed its policies so that \u201ctoday, there is no way in which those words would be used in our documents.\u201dThe project was premised on a common interest between the bank and the think tank. Brookings wanted to promote economic growth in cities by encouraging international trade, and JPMorgan wanted to gain new business by offering loans to companies in the same markets.Mr. Indyk and executives from JPMorgan said the company and the think tank simply agreed on a worthy agenda.\u201cThis was about growing the economy, and we are incredibly proud of the results of this initiative,\u201d said Peter Scher, the head of the corporate responsibility program at JPMorgan. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s had a huge impact in more than 30 cities that are involved.\u201dAt the same time, hundreds of pages of memos \u2014 status reports to JPMorgan, internal reports by Brookings staff to prepare for meetings with top bank executives, and formal documents soliciting more money \u2014 make clear that Brookings saw the Global Cities Initiative as a branding effort that could help JPMorgan bolster its standing in cities.And Brookings was ready to do its part.At times, Brookings officials seemed worried they were not doing enough for the bank.\u201cNo one wants to create overt marketing opportunities for JPMC, but we need to carve out roles and thought leadership opportunity for market presidents,\u201d said a 2013 Brookings memo, referring to a dinner with the bank\u2019s executives. \u201cWe need to do a better job tying it back to JPMC.\u201dIt remains difficult to assess whether the relationship helped the bank\u2019s business, but Mr. Scher said that was not the goal.\u201cIf the Global Cities Initiative strengthens the economic competitiveness of cities, it\u2019s a win for small businesses, job creation and everyone involved in these communities, including us,\u201d Mr. Scher said in a statement.Donations from the corporations to Brookings are tax exempt based on the premise that the think tank\u2019s work benefits the public good, not a company\u2019s bottom line.\u201cTax deductions are subsidies that are paid for by all taxpayers,\u201d Ms. Fleischer said. \u201cAnd the reason the subsidy is provided is that the charitable organization is supposed to be doing something for the public good, not that specifically benefits the private individual or corporation in the form of providing them goods or services.\u201dMr. Indyk said that opinion was \u201ctotally unfounded,\u201d noting that Brookings had retained its own lawyers to review the documents and found no problems.Other think tanks have been even more closely aligned with corporate agendas.The Atlantic Council, which has seen its annual revenue grow to $21 million from $2 million in the last decade, offers access to United States and foreign government officials in exchange for contributions. Individual donors, like FedEx, have also helped fund specific reports that align with their agendas.Six months before the Atlantic Council report was issued, FedEx and the think tank worked on plans to use the report as a lobbying tool.FedEx and the Atlantic Council, working with the European American Chamber of Commerce, also told companies being asked to participate in the study that the goal was to \u201cemphasize the positive impact that a comprehensive agreement would have on American and European small businesses.\u201dAn executive vice president at FedEx, Rajesh Subramaniam, attended an event at Atlantic Council headquarters in Washington to celebrate the release of the final report. So did a key supporter, Representative Erik Paulsen, Republican of Minnesota.Frederick Kempe, the Atlantic Council president, said that FedEx had donated just $20,000 to help fund the effort and that the staff at the Atlantic Council had handled the research.\u201cThere is no doubt the work of think tanks has more credibility than the work of lobbyists, but the only way we preserve it is through intellectual independence,\u201d Mr. Kempe said.General Atomics, the California-based manufacturer of Predator drones, had a clear problem. Prospects for sales were falling as the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq wound down. The company wanted the Obama administration to change its policy to allow for sales to other countries, a lucrative proposition.At about that time, the industry turned to the Center for Strategic and International Studies for help, providing money that the think tank used to conduct a study on drone policy, including exports.While defense contracting giants like Lockheed Martin and Boeing have cumulatively donated at least $77 million since 2010 to two dozen think tanks, disclosure records show, General Atomics\u2019s contribution to the Center for Strategic and International Studies was quite small \u2014 in the tens of thousands of dollars.As General Atomics was lobbying for a change in export rules governing its unmanned aerial vehicles, it helped fund a report at the Center for Strategic and International Studies that also pushed for the change.As a think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies did not file a lobbying report, but the goals of the effort were clear.Boeing and Lockheed Martin, drone makers that were major C.S.I.S. contributors, were also invited to attend the sessions, the emails show. The meetings and research culminated with a report released in February 2014 that reflected the industry\u2019s priorities.\u201cI came out strongly in support of export,\u201d Mr. Brannen, the lead author of the study, wrote in an email to Kenneth B. Handelman, the deputy assistant secretary of state for defense trade controls.But the effort did not stop there.Mr. Brannen, who has since left C.S.I.S., declined to comment. The think tank insisted that its efforts to influence administration policy were not lobbying.\u201cC.S.I.S. will not represent any donor before any government office or entity, including congressional lawmakers and executive branch officials,\u201d Mr. Hamre, the chief executive, said in his statement to The Times. \u201cWe do not lobby.\u201dOne thing is clear: The result was a victory for General Atomics.A State Department spokesman said that while the government officials involved in the review had received opinions from think tanks and industry officials, \u201cat the end of the day, this is a considered U.S. government policy.\u201dLater, after he had joined the Hudson Institute and helped create the Center for American Seapower, he approached Huntington officials again, and they were interested.\u201cA think tank has more prestige,\u201d Mr. McGrath said.Huntington Ingalls paid $100,000 to fund the work, a critical commitment for Mr. McGrath, who said he was paid by Hudson only if he could successfully solicit donations to support his research.Mr. McGrath said he had always been a strong proponent of aircraft carriers, so the company was not buying his opinion.\u201cThe Hudson Center makes no secret about being very pro-sea power,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a company came that wanted us to write a piece that advocated for something other than that, the answer would be no.\u201dIn exchange for Huntington Ingalls\u2019s support, company officials were given regular briefings on the research and the opportunity to suggest revisions to early drafts, Mr. McGrath said.Huntington Ingalls, the sole builder of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers in the United States, and other players in the shipbuilding industry were looking for ways to increase or maintain funding for the construction of these giant ships. They turned to think tanks for help. Here is a look at the strategy, which involved the Hudson Institute and others.\u201cWe have an iterative process already laid out in which we will sit down with them and go through drafts and discuss where we are going,\u201d Mr. McGrath said. He added that he had not accepted all of the company\u2019s suggestions.The strategy \u2014 lining up think tank reports as lobbying tools that echoed each other \u2014 was backed up with a series of letters to the editor, dozens of posts on Twitter and Facebook, and op-ed pieces.Mr. McGrath said he, too, wondered if this storm of industry-funded work might be threatening the integrity of the process.\u201cI see a lot of stuff that comes out in Washington,\u201d Mr. McGrath said, \u201cand I got to scratch my head and say, \u2018That guy must be on the payroll.\u2019\u201dBrooke Williams is a reporter at the New England Center for Investigative Reporting, which collaborated with The New York Times on this series.

She wanted character, not shiny out of the box. Some of the cymbals she got were grimy with age and water spots that hinted of concerts in the rain. Others were chipped, dinged and dented.\u201cYou walk through space and you have cause and effect,\u201d she said.But like Mr. Allen himself, who has fingerprints on much of the city\u2019s explosion of growth, geekiness only touches the surface.Now his passion for art, as a collector and benefactor, is resonating too. The fair, which featured 84 galleries from locations as varied as New York, Los Angeles, Seoul and Miami \u2014 up from 60 in its first year \u2014 drew more than 15,000 visitors last year, and had about 18,000 by the fair\u2019s close on Sunday.What the fair says about Seattle, and whether its art community was sufficiently represented, with 18 Pacific Northwest galleries on the roster \u2014 and only 10 from Seattle \u2014 remains a continuing debate.\u201cIf there\u2019s going to be all this energy, and all these collectors coming in from out of town, and critics and press talking about it, we can either, as an art community, sit on the sideline and watch the spectacle, or we can participate and ride that wave.

He also deeply appreciates, he added, the simple joy of the unexpected.Laura Fried, the Seattle Art Fair\u2019s artistic director, said that she gravitated to what the artists were trying to say about the connection between technology and modern life.\u201cThe conceptual underpinnings are more what I find interesting,\u201d she said.\u201cThe way that we are arranging our world is changing, with digital space merging with physical space,\u201d she said. \u201cI really love thinking about softness in public.\u201dMs. Kasper said she thought about the human stories behind the objects in assembling her cymbals project.

{"Headline": "Apple Becomes a Green Energy Supplier, With Itself as Customer", "Date": "2016-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 The words are stenciled on the front of the Apple Store, a glass box sandwiched between a nondescript Thai restaurant and a CVS pharmacy in downtown Palo Alto: \u201cThis store runs on 100 percent renewable energy.\u201dIf Apple\u2019s plans play out, it will be able to make that claim not only for its operations throughout California but also beyond, as the company aims to meet its growing needs for electricity with green sources like solar, wind and hydroelectric power.Like other big companies before it, including Walmart and Google, Apple recently received a federal designation for its energy subsidiary that allows it to become a wholesale seller of electricity from coast to coast. In effect, Apple is creating its own green utility company, although the main customer is itself.The motives may be economic as much as they are environmental. As a wholesaler, Apple could reduce the cost of its electricity load, which reached 831 million kilowatt-hours in the last fiscal year \u2014 enough to power about 76,000 homes for a year. But like a growing number of corporations, Apple is intent on reducing carbon dioxide emissions from electricity production \u2014 one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.In one ambitious venture, Apple has contracted with First Solar to begin buying a little less than half of the power later this year from California Flats, a solar energy farm now under construction. Under the terms of the deal, Apple will pay $848 million for the electricity over 25 years and receive the farm\u2019s total output by the end of the agreement. It is one of largest commercial clean energy contracts yet.Lisa Jackson, the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency who is now the Apple executive overseeing environmental policy, social initiatives and worldwide government affairs, said she hoped Apple could serve as a model for the many other big corporate power users that are now embracing clean energy.\u201cThis is just another sort of innovative way to get that power onto the grid so we don\u2019t have to take the California grid-mix default, which still includes fossil fuel,\u201d Ms. Jackson said.Although much of Apple\u2019s manufacturing is done offshore, it still has extensive needs for electric power in the United States \u2014 and not only for the sprawling new corporate campus it is building at its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., and its 270 retail stores around the country.One of Apple\u2019s biggest demands for electricity comes from operating the computing cloud through which it sells apps, music and videos to users of its iPhones, iPads and Mac computers.Apple\u2019s move comes as prices for renewable energy continue to plummet. And signing long-term contracts allows businesses to shield themselves from potentially higher, more volatile charges from a power company. Apple would not say how much it was paying for California Flats\u2019s energy, but Ms. Jackson said last year at a Wall Street Journal conference that it was less than what it paid for commercial power. She said she expected the company to save hundreds of millions of dollars over the life of the contract.Google, which received its federal energy wholesale designation from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 2010, is a big proponent of the approach Apple is now taking.\u201cRunning any kind of business, having predictability in terms of your operating costs can be very important,\u201d said Gary Demasi, director of operations for data center energy and location strategy at Google, which has been a leading investor in and user of clean energy. \u201cRenewable energy, from a cost perspective, is now competitive with other forms of energy, much more so than it was a few years ago.\u201dExecutives face greater pressure from shareholders and customers to show that they are doing their part to fight climate change. At the same time, corporate energy use has exploded, driven in many cases by the ravenous demands of the data cloud.\u201cWe are all becoming very large energy players, and this is a shift,\u201d said Brian Janous, director of energy strategy at Microsoft. \u201cEnergy is not something that Microsoft or Amazon or Google really ever had to think much about prior to the advent of the cloud.\u201dElectric utilities have begun to respond by creating products and services to meet the corporate demand for clean energy, said Letha Tawney, the World Resources Institute\u2019s director of utility innovation.One such product is a green tariff. It was pioneered in North Carolina by Duke Energy and is now under consideration in about a dozen states. It allows companies to designate that they are paying for a renewable energy supply.Another is a synthetic or virtual power purchase agreement, under which companies contract to buy the output of a clean power plant, as Apple is doing with California Flats.Although the companies say these arrangements mean they are running their businesses on renewable energy, in reality the clean power often does not flow directly to their facilities. They typically buy the renewable energy in amounts to match what they draw from the grid \u2014 a system of swaps that Ms. Jackson of Apple likened to using an A.T.M.\u201cThe dollar you deposit in the bank might not be the exact same bill that you get out,\u201d she said.Robert F. Shapiro, a partner at the law firm Chadbourne & Parke who focuses on project finance and energy, describes it as meaningful symbolism.\u201cThey\u2019re actually getting power from their local utility, which may be coal,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cBut they\u2019re deemed to have put into the world carbon-neutral energy, which they are deemed to have used for their load.\u201dTo keep track of the clean energy credits, power generators work with registries to issue numbered certificates.\u201cThe power flows into the grid. The electrons go where they go,\u201d Ms. Tawney said. \u201cBut because there\u2019s a renewable-energy certificate, no one else can claim the same zero-carbon benefit.\u201dSuch complexities are necessary, executives and clean energy advocates say, because it is not often feasible to install enough renewable-power generators at corporate sites to meet companies\u2019 full energy needs.Walmart, despite having installed solar panels, wind turbines and fuel cells at stores and distribution centers, can nonetheless meet only about a third of those operations\u2019 energy needs. So it also buys renewable energy from generators and utilities, said David Ozment, director of energy at Walmart stores.Procter & Gamble, another member of the energy buyers\u2019 alliance, has arranged to purchase all of the steam from a biomass generator under construction at a plant in Georgia where it makes Charmin toilet paper and Bounty paper towels, said Jack McAneny, the company\u2019s director of sustainability.But that was possible, he said, only because of the plant\u2019s location near a source of waste wood and pulp for fuel and the cooperation of P&G\u2019s partners. Among those partners are the local utility, Georgia Power, which will buy the electricity from the generator for its customers from Constellation, the company that developed and will own and operate the generator.At Apple, where the purchase or production of renewable energy has more than tripled since 2012, the company would prefer to not have to go to great lengths to ensure a clean energy supply, Ms. Jackson said. But the public energy grid is simply still too dependent on carbon-based fuels to make that possible.\u201cIf we had our preference, we\u2019d just be able to say, \u2018We want 100 percent green power everywhere we use power,\u2019\u201d Ms. Jackson said. \u201cThe best would be if we could run every one of our stores, every one of our data centers, every office complex, every building we have, on 100 percent renewable \u2014 and if we didn\u2019t have to spend a whole bunch of our time and energy figuring out how to get that done.\u201dAdvertisement"}

If Rackspace\u2019s strategic shift to sell services on these platforms succeeds, Apollo will have a nice payday.About 70 percent of Rackspace\u2019s revenue comes from managing server farms for individual companies. That is a stable but relatively low-growth business. The excitement has come from its public cloud operations, where it competes against Amazon Web Services and Microsoft\u2019s Azure, selling on-demand computing and services.The problem is this is a business of scale. Bigger companies can negotiate to buy servers and power for less, and deploy gear more effectively. So Amazon and Microsoft can offer better deals to customers without suffering a big hit to margins.Rackspace is trying a bit of jujitsu. While it is not abandoning its efforts, the company realizes it cannot effectively compete with Amazon and Microsoft. So it has become a partner, selling services and helping companies connect their data and software to Amazon Web Services and Azure. There is an additional benefit to Apollo. It takes a lot less capital to offer consulting services than to build and run server farms.There is risk. While its existing business of managing server farms for individual businesses probably will provide enough cash flow to cover costs and service debt, success will rely on its new partnerships taking off. That may not happen. Customers may wonder whether it makes sense to pay for additional support and services, especially as Amazon and Microsoft continually make their web services easier to use. The growth of cloud computing, however, may mean there\u2019s plenty of room on the Amazon and Microsoft bandwagons.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple, Congress and the Missing Taxes", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialApple and the United States are crying foul over the ruling in Europe that Apple received illegal tax breaks from Ireland and must hand over 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion), a record tax penalty in Europe.But Apple and the United States have only themselves to blame for the situation.Initially, deferral was a convenience for multinationals, as they sought investment opportunities abroad. Today, it is the taproot of global tax avoidance. Financial engineering has let American companies shift profits into foreign accounts, while they lobby Congress for tax-rate cuts in exchange for repatriating the money. Currently, there is some $2 trillion in corporate profits in offshore tax-deferred accounts; besides Apple, Microsoft, Google, Cisco and Oracle also have large stashes. Apple is one of nearly two dozen major corporations pushing Congress for a \u201ctax holiday,\u201d which would let companies bring back foreign-held money over the course of a year at a discounted tax rate, rather than the current rate, 35 percent.Before the European ruling on Tuesday, the debate over a tax holiday had pitted Republicans, who have generally favored the idea, against Democrats, who have viewed it as an unjustified reward for tax avoidance. The Democrats have history on their side. A tax holiday in 2005 lowered the corporate rate to 5.25 percent, enticing corporations to repatriate some $300 billion. It was billed as a way to create jobs and increase investment, but the money was used mostly for dividend payments, share buybacks (which tend to raise executive pay) and severance for laid-off employees. Worse, the tax holiday inspired multinationals to stash as much money abroad as they possibly could in anticipation of another holiday.The European ruling, however, could sharply alter the terms of the congressional debate. Republicans and Democrats alike have always assumed that foreign-held profits would one day be repatriated. The big question was the rate at which they would ultimately be taxed. Similarly, the Treasury assumes that deferred foreign profits will one day be taxed when it projects future revenues \u2014 an important measure of the nation\u2019s fiscal health.But the money won\u2019t be repatriated and taxed under American law if Europeans, in the course of enforcing their own laws against tax havens, get their hands on it first. And that, in a nutshell, is why members of Congress and Treasury officials are so upset about the Apple ruling. They understand, correctly, that tax-law enforcement in Europe could reduce the sums they expect to collect taxes on someday. What they don\u2019t understand, or aren\u2019t saying, is that they brought the problem on themselves.The way forward is not to declare a tax war with Europe. It is for Congress to agree on a way to tax foreign-held corporate profits. President Obama put forth a reasonable approach in 2015, when he proposed a mandatory 14 percent tax on multinationals\u2019 current offshore profits \u2014 whether they are repatriated or not \u2014 and, thereafter, a new minimum tax rate of 19 percent on profits moved offshore. An even better approach would be to simply end indefinite corporate tax deferral, imposing American taxes on profits when they are made.Republicans rejected Mr. Obama\u2019s proposal in 2015, and there is no chance that lawmakers will engage in such a debate so close to the election. But the next president and Congress will need to act to ensure that at long last, American corporations pay their fair share in taxes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Make Algorithms Accountable", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorAlgorithms are ubiquitous in our lives. They map out the best route to our destination and help us find new music based on what we listen to now. But they are also being employed to inform fundamental decisions about our lives.Companies use them to sort through stacks of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s from job seekers. Credit agencies use them to determine our credit scores. And the criminal justice system is increasingly using algorithms to predict a defendant\u2019s future criminality.Those computer-generated criminal \u201crisk scores\u201d were at the center of a recent Wisconsin Supreme Court decision that set the first significant limits on the use of risk algorithms in sentencing.The court ruled that while judges could use these risk scores, the scores could not be a \u201cdeterminative\u201d factor in whether a defendant was jailed or placed on probation. And, most important, the court stipulated that a presentence report submitted to the judge must include a warning about the limits of the algorithm\u2019s accuracy.This warning requirement is an important milestone in the debate over how our data-driven society should hold decision-making software accountable. But advocates for big data due process argue that much more must be done to assure the appropriateness and accuracy of algorithm results.An algorithm is a procedure or set of instructions often used by a computer to solve a problem. Many algorithms are secret. In Wisconsin, for instance, the risk-score formula was developed by a private company and has never been publicly disclosed because it is considered proprietary. This secrecy has made it difficult for lawyers to challenge a result.The credit score is the lone algorithm in which consumers have a legal right to examine and challenge the underlying data used to generate it. In 1970, President Richard M. Nixon signed the Fair Credit Reporting Act. It gave people the right to see the data in their credit reports and to challenge and delete data that was inaccurate.For most other algorithms, people are expected to read fine-print privacy policies, in the hopes of determining whether their data might be used against them in a way that they wouldn\u2019t expect.However, since the European regulations apply only to situations that don\u2019t involve human judgment \u201csuch as automatic refusal of an online credit application or e-recruiting practices without any human intervention,\u201d they are likely to affect a narrow class of automated decisions.In 2012, the Obama administration proposed a \u201cconsumer privacy bill of rights\u201d \u2014 modeled on European data protection principles \u2014 that would have allowed consumers to access and correct some data that was used to make judgments about them. But the measure died in Congress.More recently, the White House has suggested that algorithm makers police themselves. In a recent report, the administration called for automated decision-making tools to be tested for fairness, and for the development of \u201calgorithmic auditing.\u201dEven Wisconsin, which has been using risk assessment scores in sentencing for four years, has not independently tested whether it works or whether it is biased against certain groups.Some have argued that these failure rates are still better than the human biases of individual judges, although there is no data on judges with which to compare. But even if that were the case, are we willing to accept an algorithm with such a high failure rate for black defendants?Warning labels are not a bad start toward answering that question. Judges may be cautious of risk scores that are accompanied by a statement that the score has been found to overpredict recidivism among black defendants. Yet as we rapidly enter the era of automated decision making, we should demand more than warning labels.A better goal would be to try to at least meet, if not exceed, the accountability standard set by a president not otherwise known for his commitment to transparency, Richard Nixon: the right to examine and challenge the data used to make algorithmic decisions about us.Advertisement"}

They were the catalysts for Facebook\u2019s partnership to build classroom software with Summit Public Schools.Facebook is out to upend the traditional student-teacher relationship.Rather than have teachers hand out class assignments, the Facebook-Summit learning management system puts students in charge of selecting their projects and setting their pace. The idea is to encourage students to develop skills, like resourcefulness and time management, that might help them succeed in college.\u201cAs parents and kids and teachers get access to this type of learning, I think more and more will want it,\u201d Diane Tavenner, the co-founder and chief executive of Summit Public Schools, said in a telephone interview.But the Summit-Facebook system, called the \u201cSummit Personalized Learning Platform,\u201d is different.The software gives students a full view of their academic responsibilities for the year in each class and breaks them down into customizable lesson modules they can tackle at their own pace. A student working on a science assignment, for example, may choose to create a project using video, text or audio files. Students may also work asynchronously, tackling different sections of the year\u2019s work at the same time.The system inverts the traditional teacher-led classroom hierarchy, requiring schools to provide intensive one-on-one mentoring and coaching to help each student adapt.This summer, more than 1,500 educators and leaders of public, private and charter schools participating in the program, called Summit Basecamp, attended sessions to learn how to use the system. Among the 19 schools that introduced the new learning approach last year, at least a few educators and administrators reported a steep learning curve.\u201cThere were many points where we weren\u2019t sure the Summit Basecamp model was what our students needed,\u201d said Claire Fisher, the principal of Urban Promise Academy, a public middle school in Oakland, Calif., which introduced the platform in its sixth-grade classes.By the end of the school year, however, 31 percent of the school\u2019s sixth graders were reading at or above their grade level, compared with just 9 percent in the fall. That was a larger improvement in reading than students in seventh and eighth grades, which did not use the platform, Ms. Fisher said.Advertisement"}

She relies on apps like Google Docs for documents and Google Slides for presentations, which are available through a web browser.\u201cA tablet is just like your cellphone, but bigger,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see a point of getting a tablet.\u201dBut Claire Ashcroft, 19, who studies public health at Brigham Young University in Idaho, said the opposite. Half of her textbooks are digitized, and she uses apps like Microsoft Excel and Word \u2014 so her ideal school device would be a Windows machine with a touch screen, like a Microsoft Surface tablet.The polarizing responses illustrate how back-to-school shopping for technology gadgets has become increasingly complex for parents. In the past, the dilemma for most students was whether to get a Windows PC or a Mac. Now, because of a proliferation of different computing forms with the rise of mobile devices, the debate has shifted toward whether to buy a computer or a tablet \u2014 and which operating system on top of that.Then there are the different types of software and tools that students use, like flashcard apps or readers for digital textbooks, some of which are for mobile devices and others for computers.To make back-to-school season easier, parents should have a conversation with their children about what devices and which operating system to buy based on their student\u2019s area of studies and the apps they use.I also compiled a guide to some of the best back-to-school products, including computers, mobile devices, audio accessories and food gadgets. The list was curated after testing dozens of products and interviewing five college students about the tools that help them do homework and get through cramming sessions. (While this list focuses on college students, many of whom will be getting their own computers for the first time, some items would also be a good fit for high schoolers.)The students I polled were split on whether a laptop or tablet would be the best study tool. In general, students in science-oriented fields would probably benefit from a laptop, which can handle multitasking more easily and run more powerful apps than tablets. For designers and liberal arts majors who are using more lightweight apps for writing essays or drawing sketches, a tablet may be a better fit.There are two caveats. First, Apple is expected to release a brand-new iPhone this fall; so if you go the Apple route, it would be wise to wait a few months. Second, these are high-end phones that cost roughly $700, which could easily blow your budget.High-quality audio gear is a sound investment for students. Roommates can be loud distractions from schoolwork and sleep, plus a bit of music can ease the pain of typing out a tedious essay.Speaking of water kettles, a food gadget or two will not go amiss in students\u2019 lives, especially if the devices offer a shortcut to downing some caffeine or gobbling up ramen.But she would like a Microsoft Surface tablet.\u201cIf we\u2019re talking wishful here, I would choose that,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a couple of friends with those, and I think they\u2019re pretty nice.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the maker of the Nexus 6P.

He was 75.His son Thomas confirmed the death but said the cause had not been determined.Mr. Ellenby\u2019s pioneering work came to fruition in the early 1980s, after he founded Grid Systems, a company in Mountain View, Calif. As chief executive, he assembled an engineering and design team that included the noted British-born industrial designer William Moggridge.It went on to become a valuable tool for big corporations, government spies, White House and Pentagon officials, and even astronauts, surviving the midair explosion of the space shuttle Challenger in which seven people died.The Compass came with advanced, and expensive, data storage capacity called bubble memory and was accordingly pricey, originally selling for $8,150 ($20,325 today). As a result, it found an enthusiastic market not with consumers but rather in Washington.One version, intended for United States special-operations forces, was said to have come with a red dot on its black magnesium case, placed there as an aiming guide for any commando who might have to shoot the device to destroy its data quickly.Intelligence agencies were also eager buyers; the Compass was marketed as a kind of sexy, high-tech device that might appeal to James Bond.Another user was Vice Adm. John Poindexter, President Ronald Reagan\u2019s national security adviser in the mid-1980s. Admiral Poindexter, a computer hobbyist, would take the laptop with him when Mr. Reagan traveled.He would also spend his free time using the Compass to reprogram the IBM electronic mail system that the White House employed, according to James Opfer, who was director of the White House Communications Agency then and who arranged the first White House purchase of the machines, for $2 million.Mr. Opfer said in an interview that he was \u201c90 percent certain\u201d that for a time, a Compass accompanied the president\u2019s ever-present \u201cnuclear football\u201d \u2014 the device, carried by a military aide, that makes it possible to launch nuclear weapons. \u201cIt was quite heavy,\u201d he recalled.Admiral Poindexter, also in an interview this week, remembered the Grid computers as \u201creally nice machines\u201d that had been \u201cbuilt like an armored tank.\u201d He said that he and Robert C. McFarlane, who preceded him as Mr. Reagan\u2019s national security adviser, had each kept Mr. Reagan\u2019s Compass locked in a home safe.NASA also used one as a backup navigational device in its space shuttle program. One was aboard the Challenger on the morning of Jan. 28, 1986, when a rocket-booster failure destroyed the craft shortly after liftoff from Cape Canaveral in Florida. The Compass, which had been attached to a dashboard with Velcro, was recovered from the debris and found to be still working.John Ellenby was born in Corbridge, in northern England, on Jan. 9, 1941, to Conrad Ellenby, a zoologist, and the former Mary McCarraher, a biologist. He studied economics and geography at University College London and spent a year in the early 1960s studying at the London School of Economics, where he encountered mainframe computers.He later worked for the British computer maker Ferranti and lectured on computing at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. He moved to Northern California in the early 1970s to work for the Xerox Corporation at its Palo Alto Research Center.At the time, Xerox was designing a desktop computer, known as the Alto, which would become an inspiration for the Apple Lisa and Macintosh, and for Microsoft Windows. Inside Xerox, the Alto was known as an \u201cinterim Dynabook,\u201d a reference to the prototype for a portable machine envisioned by the Xerox computer scientist Alan Kay.Mr. Ellenby was instrumental in managing the development of the Alto II, a version of the prototype that could be manufactured more easily. He had earned a reputation as a technologist who was adept at turning technologies into products.\u201cHe was good and aggressive and even daring, you might say,\u201d said David Liddle, a Xerox executive at the time.Mr. Ellenby left Xerox to found Grid in 1979. The move paid off. In addition to his government customers, corporations like Bank of America, Chevron and McKinsey & Company were early buyers.Mr. Weber, the computer historian, said that the name Grid was derived from Mr. Ellenby\u2019s vision of a gridlike network \u2014 a precursor to the internet \u2014 that would connect various computers with one another, allowing them to share files. The idea was to sell the system through a business services company. The company called the system Grid Central.Initially the Compass was so energy-hungry, it required a plug. And the machine took competitors by surprise. One was Adam Osborne, the developer of the Osborne 1, an early portable computer \u2014 a \u201cluggable,\u201d in industry parlance \u2014 about the size of a sewing machine. Appearing with Mr. Ellenby on an industry panel, Mr. Osborne was startled to realize that the device sitting flat on a table nearby was, when it was opened, a portable computer.Mr. Ellenby sold Grid to the Tandy Corporation in March 1988. He went on to start Agilis, a maker of hand-held tablet computers, and, with his son Thomas, GeoVector, which pioneered navigation and augmented-reality applications.In addition to his son Thomas, Mr. Ellenby is survived by another son, Peter, and a granddaughter.In his later years, Mr. Ellenby would reflect on what a huge technical challenge the idea of a portable computer had presented a half-century ago. In an interview, he once related that the inspiration for it came on a visit to the White House.There, he met an official who said he wanted a machine that would include everything that was in a standard business personal computer but that would fit in half the briefcase that Mr. Ellenby was carrying with him at the time.

In effect, Apple is creating its own green utility company, although the main customer is itself.The motives may be economic as much as they are environmental. As a wholesaler, Apple could reduce the cost of its electricity load, which reached 831 million kilowatt-hours in the last fiscal year \u2014 enough to power about 76,000 homes for a year. But like a growing number of corporations, Apple is intent on reducing carbon dioxide emissions from electricity production \u2014 one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.In one ambitious venture, Apple has contracted with First Solar to begin buying a little less than half of the power later this year from California Flats, a solar energy farm now under construction.

It is one of largest commercial clean energy contracts yet.Lisa Jackson, the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency who is now the Apple executive overseeing environmental policy, social initiatives and worldwide government affairs, said she hoped Apple could serve as a model for the many other big corporate power users that are now embracing clean energy.\u201cThis is just another sort of innovative way to get that power onto the grid so we don\u2019t have to take the California grid-mix default, which still includes fossil fuel,\u201d Ms. Jackson said.Although much of Apple\u2019s manufacturing is done offshore, it still has extensive needs for electric power in the United States \u2014 and not only for the sprawling new corporate campus it is building at its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., and its 270 retail stores around the country.One of Apple\u2019s biggest demands for electricity comes from operating the computing cloud through which it sells apps, music and videos to users of its iPhones, iPads and Mac computers.Apple\u2019s move comes as prices for renewable energy continue to plummet. And signing long-term contracts allows businesses to shield themselves from potentially higher, more volatile charges from a power company. Apple would not say how much it was paying for California Flats\u2019s energy, but Ms. Jackson said last year at a Wall Street Journal conference that it was less than what it paid for commercial power. She said she expected the company to save hundreds of millions of dollars over the life of the contract.Google, which received its federal energy wholesale designation from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 2010, is a big proponent of the approach Apple is now taking.\u201cRunning any kind of business, having predictability in terms of your operating costs can be very important,\u201d said Gary Demasi, director of operations for data center energy and location strategy at Google, which has been a leading investor in and user of clean energy. \u201cRenewable energy, from a cost perspective, is now competitive with other forms of energy, much more so than it was a few years ago.\u201dExecutives face greater pressure from shareholders and customers to show that they are doing their part to fight climate change. At the same time, corporate energy use has exploded, driven in many cases by the ravenous demands of the data cloud.\u201cWe are all becoming very large energy players, and this is a shift,\u201d said Brian Janous, director of energy strategy at Microsoft. \u201cEnergy is not something that Microsoft or Amazon or Google really ever had to think much about prior to the advent of the cloud.\u201dElectric utilities have begun to respond by creating products and services to meet the corporate demand for clean energy, said Letha Tawney, the World Resources Institute\u2019s director of utility innovation.One such product is a green tariff. It was pioneered in North Carolina by Duke Energy and is now under consideration in about a dozen states. It allows companies to designate that they are paying for a renewable energy supply.Another is a synthetic or virtual power purchase agreement, under which companies contract to buy the output of a clean power plant, as Apple is doing with California Flats.Although the companies say these arrangements mean they are running their businesses on renewable energy, in reality the clean power often does not flow directly to their facilities. They typically buy the renewable energy in amounts to match what they draw from the grid \u2014 a system of swaps that Ms. Jackson of Apple likened to using an A.T.M.\u201cThe dollar you deposit in the bank might not be the exact same bill that you get out,\u201d she said.Robert F. Shapiro, a partner at the law firm Chadbourne & Parke who focuses on project finance and energy, describes it as meaningful symbolism.\u201cThey\u2019re actually getting power from their local utility, which may be coal,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cBut they\u2019re deemed to have put into the world carbon-neutral energy, which they are deemed to have used for their load.\u201dTo keep track of the clean energy credits, power generators work with registries to issue numbered certificates.\u201cThe power flows into the grid. The electrons go where they go,\u201d Ms. Tawney said. \u201cBut because there\u2019s a renewable-energy certificate, no one else can claim the same zero-carbon benefit.\u201dSuch complexities are necessary, executives and clean energy advocates say, because it is not often feasible to install enough renewable-power generators at corporate sites to meet companies\u2019 full energy needs.Walmart, despite having installed solar panels, wind turbines and fuel cells at stores and distribution centers, can nonetheless meet only about a third of those operations\u2019 energy needs. So it also buys renewable energy from generators and utilities, said David Ozment, director of energy at Walmart stores.Procter & Gamble, another member of the energy buyers\u2019 alliance, has arranged to purchase all of the steam from a biomass generator under construction at a plant in Georgia where it makes Charmin toilet paper and Bounty paper towels, said Jack McAneny, the company\u2019s director of sustainability.But that was possible, he said, only because of the plant\u2019s location near a source of waste wood and pulp for fuel and the cooperation of P&G\u2019s partners. Among those partners are the local utility, Georgia Power, which will buy the electricity from the generator for its customers from Constellation, the company that developed and will own and operate the generator.At Apple, where the purchase or production of renewable energy has more than tripled since 2012, the company would prefer to not have to go to great lengths to ensure a clean energy supply, Ms. Jackson said. But the public energy grid is simply still too dependent on carbon-based fuels to make that possible.\u201cIf we had our preference, we\u2019d just be able to say, \u2018We want 100 percent green power everywhere we use power,\u2019\u201d Ms. Jackson said. \u201cThe best would be if we could run every one of our stores, every one of our data centers, every office complex, every building we have, on 100 percent renewable \u2014 and if we didn\u2019t have to spend a whole bunch of our time and energy figuring out how to get that done.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It wants the Alexa Voice Service, which powers Echo, to be an ingredient in devices around the home and beyond, even if they aren\u2019t made by Amazon.The vision of an omnipresent intelligent assistant is one Amazon shares, in one form or another, with most other big technology companies, including Apple, Google and Microsoft. Along with a handful of start-ups, these companies see their intelligent assistants as powerful new ways for users to interact with devices and internet services \u2014 just as smartphone touch screens were.Many technology specialists think that people will be O.K. with a single intelligent assistant in their lives but that most won\u2019t have the patience to regularly use two or three of them, each with its individual quirks. As a result, each company is racing to weave its assistant into as many devices and services as possible.\u201cWe\u2019re taking $180 worth of utility and adding it into a $200 device,\u201d he said.Ford Motor is working with Amazon to integrate Alexa into its vehicles so drivers can control smart-home features like lights, thermostats and security systems from their cars.Over 10,000 developers have registered to integrate Alexa into their products, Amazon said. It won\u2019t say how many Echo units it has sold, except to say that millions of devices with Alexa in them have been purchased.In an interview this spring, David Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for devices, said that the company wanted there to be as many Alexa-linked \u201cendpoints\u201d around the home as possible and that Amazon did not really care who made those devices. Amazon has expanded its lineup of devices that use Alexa with its Echo Dot, a miniature version of the Echo speaker, and Amazon Tap, a portable Bluetooth speaker.\u201cThe longer-term vision is a little bit like the \u2018Star Trek\u2019 computer,\u201d Mr. Limp said. \u201cCaptain Kirk or Picard could sit on the bridge and ask anything and get the right answer.\u201dBut while Amazon has made a lot of progress in this regard, it may have a hard time extending Alexa\u2019s reach outside the home because of its weaknesses in mobile technology, analysts say.The success of Echo has been described as a redemption of sorts for Amazon after it suffered a brutal defeat in the smartphone market with its Fire Phone, which the company stopped selling after poor sales \u2014 a misstep that has left Amazon vulnerable.Apple and Google have clear advantages over Amazon because of their dominant positions in the mobile market. And they are pushing their versions of Alexa \u2014 Siri and Google\u2019s assistant \u2014 as ways to control other devices throughout the home.As intelligent assistants improve in quality, Jan Dawson, an analyst at Jackdaw Research, thinks people will want these virtual helpers to follow them all day like a companion. \u201cWhat you want from an assistant is that they are always available to you everywhere,\u201d he said.While Amazon could eventually give people access to Alexa\u2019s functions through apps on smartphones (a couple of apps from independent developers do this already), Mr. Dawson is skeptical that Amazon will be able to make them work as well as assistants more deeply integrated into smartphones by Apple and Google.\u201cThey\u2019re basically absent on smartphones, which are devices we take everywhere we go,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Make Algorithms Accountable", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAlgorithms are ubiquitous in our lives. They map out the best route to our destination and help us find new music based on what we listen to now. But they are also being employed to inform fundamental decisions about our lives.Companies use them to sort through stacks of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s from job seekers. Credit agencies use them to determine our credit scores. And the criminal justice system is increasingly using algorithms to predict a defendant\u2019s future criminality.Those computer-generated criminal \u201crisk scores\u201d were at the center of a recent Wisconsin Supreme Court decision that set the first significant limits on the use of risk algorithms in sentencing.The court ruled that while judges could use these risk scores, the scores could not be a \u201cdeterminative\u201d factor in whether a defendant was jailed or placed on probation. And, most important, the court stipulated that a presentence report submitted to the judge must include a warning about the limits of the algorithm\u2019s accuracy.This warning requirement is an important milestone in the debate over how our data-driven society should hold decision-making software accountable. But advocates for big data due process argue that much more must be done to assure the appropriateness and accuracy of algorithm results.An algorithm is a procedure or set of instructions often used by a computer to solve a problem. Many algorithms are secret. In Wisconsin, for instance, the risk-score formula was developed by a private company and has never been publicly disclosed because it is considered proprietary. This secrecy has made it difficult for lawyers to challenge a result.The credit score is the lone algorithm in which consumers have a legal right to examine and challenge the underlying data used to generate it. In 1970, President Richard M. Nixon signed the Fair Credit Reporting Act. It gave people the right to see the data in their credit reports and to challenge and delete data that was inaccurate.For most other algorithms, people are expected to read fine-print privacy policies, in the hopes of determining whether their data might be used against them in a way that they wouldn\u2019t expect.However, since the European regulations apply only to situations that don\u2019t involve human judgment \u201csuch as automatic refusal of an online credit application or e-recruiting practices without any human intervention,\u201d they are likely to affect a narrow class of automated decisions.In 2012, the Obama administration proposed a \u201cconsumer privacy bill of rights\u201d \u2014 modeled on European data protection principles \u2014 that would have allowed consumers to access and correct some data that was used to make judgments about them. But the measure died in Congress.More recently, the White House has suggested that algorithm makers police themselves. In a recent report, the administration called for automated decision-making tools to be tested for fairness, and for the development of \u201calgorithmic auditing.\u201dEven Wisconsin, which has been using risk assessment scores in sentencing for four years, has not independently tested whether it works or whether it is biased against certain groups.Some have argued that these failure rates are still better than the human biases of individual judges, although there is no data on judges with which to compare. But even if that were the case, are we willing to accept an algorithm with such a high failure rate for black defendants?Warning labels are not a bad start toward answering that question. Judges may be cautious of risk scores that are accompanied by a statement that the score has been found to overpredict recidivism among black defendants. Yet as we rapidly enter the era of automated decision making, we should demand more than warning labels.A better goal would be to try to at least meet, if not exceed, the accountability standard set by a president not otherwise known for his commitment to transparency, Richard Nixon: the right to examine and challenge the data used to make algorithmic decisions about us.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oracle, Having Bet Billions on Its Future, Sets Sights on Data Analysis", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsOracle Corporation may well be the single most important technology firm for businesses. Over 300,000 companies around the world use its database, and 100,000 customers have purchased its business applications. Even companies gunning for Oracle \u2014 like Amazon, Google and Salesforce \u2014 have used Oracle\u2019s technology.Besides selling applications more efficiently, he said, Oracle has pooled a large amount of information derived from over 1,500 data providers. \u201cMarketers and brands find this very powerful,\u201d he said in an email, as Oracle targets \u201cover 45,000 different dimensions (demographic, geography, online and offline behavior).\u201dIn other words, what Google and Facebook know based on your online life, as well as what companies learn from your shopping habits, credit and warranty behavior, among other things. Oracle will also have data on what customers do after an ad campaign, so advertisers can check the outcome of a Google ad blitz.The same data-heavy approach can be used in functions of business like procurement, human capital management, sales and service, Mr. Kurian thinks. \u201cWe know how payrolls change around job titles, the rate of salary changes in Silicon Valley versus Bangalore, or how many people in a company are buying a $10 printer cartridge,\u201d he told me in an earlier interview.This data analysis could become a valuable adjunct to many of Oracle\u2019s database and applications businesses. Equally, it drives home how the competition in cloud computing is moving from cost savings \u2014 Amazon Web Services started by selling cheap computing and storage \u2014 to value creation through better insight.In that business, large amounts of data are a critical asset \u2014 what Mr. Kurian termed \u201ctrying to be at the center of data gravity.\u201d Oracle definitely has a place there, perhaps a better one than any company.Other elements of success will most likely include reliability, ease of use and price. Oracle may be challenged there, precisely because it has built a big and complicated system of databases, bigger than anything Amazon, Microsoft or Google sells. It has to keep those older customers happy, even as it makes data easier to move around, in and out of the cloud, for different kinds of analysis.In that, Oracle has a powerful and little-noted asset: Despite its reputation as a hard-edge company, it has good engineers with decades of experience. Employees fly in and out of Google or Facebook, but they seem to stay longer, on average, at Oracle.That can be an advantage when it comes to working on complex projects. \u201cUnderstanding complex software takes a year,\u201d Mr. Kurian said. \u201cUnderstanding the intentions behind it, which you need if you\u2019re going to adapt it, takes even longer.\u201dSlow, steady and reliable may make people at the fast, young tech companies snicker.

{"Headline": "G.E., the 124-Year-Old Software Start-Up", "Date": "2016-08-27", "News": "Supported byIt may not qualify as a lightning-bolt eureka moment, but Jeffrey R. Immelt, chief executive of General Electric, recalls the June day in 2009 that got him thinking. He was speaking with G.E. scientists about new jet engines they were building, laden with sensors to generate a trove of data from every flight \u2014 but to what end?That data could someday be as valuable as the machinery itself, if not more so. But G.E. couldn\u2019t make use of it.But in 2011, G.E. also quietly opened a software center in San Ramon, Calif., 24 miles east of San Francisco, across the bay.Today one of San Ramon\u2019s most important projects is to build a computer operating system, but on an industrial scale \u2014 a Microsoft Windows or Google Android for factories and industrial equipment. The project is central to G.E.\u2019s drive to become what Mr. Immelt says will be a \u201ctop 10 software company\u201d by 2020.Silicon Valley veterans are skeptical.Many industries see digital threats, of course. Yet the scope of the challenge is magnified at G.E., a 124-year-old company and the nation\u2019s largest manufacturer, with more than 300,000 employees worldwide. Employees companywide have been making pilgrimages to San Ramon for technology briefings, but also to soak in the culture. Their marching orders are to try to adapt the digital wizardry and hurry-up habits of Silicon Valley to G.E.\u2019s world of industrial manufacturing.6 PhotosG.E.\u2019s success or failure over the next decade, Mr. Immelt says, depends on this transformation. He calls it \u201cprobably the most important thing I\u2019ve worked on in my career.\u201dApparently, there is no Plan B. \u201cIt\u2019s this or bust,\u201d he said.The march of digital technology \u2014 mainly inexpensive sensors, powerful computing and clever software \u2014 into the industrial world has been underway for years under the guise of \u201cthe internet of things\u201d or \u201cthe industrial internet.\u201d It is the next battlefield as companies fight to develop the dominant software layer that connects the machines.It promises to be a huge market for new products, improved service and efficiency gains in industries like energy, transportation and health care. By 2020, the industrial internet market will reach $225 billion, G.E. executives predicted in a recent meeting with analysts.So far, a major application has been predictive maintenance. Software analyzes the data generated by a machine to identify early warning signals that it needs repair, before it breaks down.The data volumes are exploding as machines new and old spawn sensors. By 2020, G.E. estimates that the data flowing off its machines in use will jump a hundredfold. That should enable far more detailed analysis, giving G.E. a chance to sell its customers not machines but \u201cbusiness outcomes,\u201d like fuel savings. Mr. Immelt sees this as a move up the industrial food chain.Yet all of this exposes G.E. to new competition beyond its traditional rivals like Rockwell Automation, Siemens and United Technologies. Tech giants, including Amazon, Cisco, Google, IBM and Microsoft also have their eye on the industrial internet market, as do a bevy of start-ups.There is precedent for trouble in other industries, of course. Google and Facebook transformed media and advertising, Amazon redefined retailing, and Uber applied an entirely new business model to taxis, which hadn\u2019t changed much in generations.\u201cThe real danger is that the data and analysis becomes worth more than the installed equipment itself,\u201d said Karim R. Lakhani, a professor at the Harvard Business School. \u201cG.E. has no choice but to try to do that itself.\u201dUntil this year, Darren Haas hadn\u2019t thought about G.E., certainly not working there. To him, G.E. meant little more than than kitchen appliances and light bulbs. \u201cI had no idea,\u201d Mr. Haas said.But he was intrigued after he met with Harel Kodesh, an expert in mobile and cloud computing who led teams at Microsoft and VMware, a maker of data-center software. Less than two years ago, Mr. Kodesh joined G.E., and he is now chief technology officer of GE Digital.That someone of Mr. Kodesh\u2019s caliber was a G.E. convert got Mr. Haas\u2019s attention. Then, Mr. Haas started grasping the role that G.E. equipment plays across the economy \u2014 in transportation, in hospitals \u2014 \u201ca whole world,\u201d he said. \u201cI found that really, really compelling.\u201dThe other thing Mr. Haas, 41, found appealing was the big computing challenge that lies ahead for the company. In May, he joined G.E. from Apple, where he was a member of the founding team at Siri, the voice-based digital assistant start-up Apple acquired in 2010. When he left Apple, Mr. Haas was head of cloud engineering, managing the computing engine behind Siri, iTunes and iCloud.At GE Digital, Mr. Haas has a similar title, head of platform cloud engineering, but in a different setting. He describes his job as applying modern software technology \u2014 machine learning, artificial intelligence and cloud computing \u2014 to the industrial arena. \u201cI\u2019ve got my work cut out for me,\u201d he said.Mr. Haas is working on the centerpiece of G.E.\u2019s software strategy, a product called Predix. Its evolution mirrors G.E.\u2019s software ambitions.Predix began as little more than a brand of software used by G.E. to service the gear it sells. One showcase use was in jet engines to do predictive maintenance, saving downtime. Around 2013, William Ruh, a former Cisco Systems executive brought in to put together the San Ramon software center, started expanding Predix to other G.E. industrial businesses.But that soon felt too small. The issue was \u201coutside disrupters,\u201d Mr. Ruh said, citing the online lodging start-up Airbnb as an example of rivals that can appear seemingly out of nowhere and that \u201cbring greater productivity \u2014 but don\u2019t own the assets they sell.\u201d G.E., Mr. Ruh notes, is the ultimate big-asset company.The other threat was rising interest among tech companies to take their internet connectivity expertise and try to apply it to industrial businesses. To get ahead of all this, G.E. reimagined Predix as a cloud-based operating system for industrial applications.Mr. Kodesh leads that effort. He ticks off the looming competitors: Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and others. \u201cThose companies are going to encroach on the territory,\u201d Mr. Kodesh said. \u201cAre we going to capitulate, or build something like Predix?\u201dThe basic idea is that G.E. and outside software developers will write programs to run on Predix. This software might, for instance, monitor the health and fine-tune the operation of equipment like oil-field rigs and wind-farm turbines, improving performance, reducing wear and adapting to changing environmental conditions. It amounts to software delivering the equivalent of personalized medicine for machines.Like any other computer operating system, Predix aims to take the complexity out of writing programs, so more people can create them. And while the instincts of the industrial world are proprietary, G.E. is following an open-source model with Predix, providing a basic design, but one open to outside contributors \u2014 more like Android from Google than Windows from Microsoft.Predix, Mr. Kodesh said, will be improved using the software equivalent of Lego blocks. \u201cSome will be G.E.\u2019s, and some will be made by third-party developers,\u201d he said.G.E. is betting that its deep knowledge of industry will give it an edge in this software arms race. The stakes for this kind of programming can be high.For a regular consumer using the internet, a misfiring algorithm in the software \u2014 \u201ca false positive\u201d \u2014 might mean a person sees an irrelevant online ad, or a bad Amazon book suggestion or Netflix movie recommendation, Mr. Kodesh said. Useless, perhaps, but not necessarily costly. But a false positive that prompts an airline to take a jet engine off the wing, Mr. Kodesh said, is a $100,000 mistake.\u201cWe really do need to have different technology, different algorithms and a different cloud, than in the consumer internet,\u201d he said.G.E. has set an ambitious target for Predix. It hopes to attract $100 million in orders this year, on its way to $4 billion in revenue by 2020. By then, the company forecasts that its total digital business \u2014 more than 90 percent of it software \u2014 may reach as much as $15 billion, up from $6 billion now.For Predix to reach its potential, though, G.E. needs outside programmers to write software for it. The company, with its deep pockets, can start the software-writing parade, but will others follow?This will be a major test. And G.E.\u2019s campaign to build an industrial operating system and create a flourishing ecosystem of software for it is just getting underway in earnest.In late July, G.E. hosted a Predix conference in Las Vegas, which attracted 1,200 software developers. Such developer gatherings are part of the playbook of every major software company but unusual for an industrial corporation.G.E. has some built-in advantages. Its installed base is huge. For example, the company says more than a third of the world\u2019s electricity is generated on G.E. equipment. It can make progress simply by winning over the aircraft makers, oil companies, hospitals and utilities that now depend on G.E. machinery.G.E. is starting to attract a developer following. Tata Consultancy Services, for one, says it now has 500 programmers designing and developing Predix applications for customers in the electric-utility, aviation and health care industries. G.E. also promotes partnerships with Infosys, Wipro and Capgemini to help business write Predix software.When he joined in 2011, Mr. Ruh had no illusions that making software a strength at a heavy-industry company would be easy. At the time, he told Mr. Immelt that would be \u201ca 10-year journey,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of that journey.\u201dPart of that is an effort to change an engineering culture that stretches back generations. \u201cIf G.E. is truly going to be a digital-industrial company, we can\u2019t be separate here,\u201d Mr. Ruh said of his software division. Digital \u201ctools and habits\u201d need to be embedded \u201cin how people do their jobs,\u201d he said.In its factory in Greenville, S.C., G.E. produces both giant power generators and evidence that this metamorphosis might work.The three-story building is crowded with immense cranes and milling, grinding and welding machines, overseen by manufacturing engineers and technicians. The finishing touches are being put on one of G.E.\u2019s new gas turbines.It looks like the business end of a rocket ship lying on its side, a gleaming steel dynamo at rest. It weighs 950,000 pounds. It fires up at nearly 2,900 degrees Fahrenheit, and it can generate enough electricity to supply more than 500,000 households.The gas turbine was brought to market in half the typical five years. That kind of accelerated product development is a performance that G.E. hopes to replicate across its industrial businesses. And it is a story of changes in design and manufacturing practices made possible by digital technology.John Lammas, the 56-year-old vice president for power generation engineering, started his working career 40 years ago, on the shop floor of a Rolls-Royce jet engine factory in Birmingham, England. He has been with G.E. for 31 years, moving up the ranks of the company\u2019s jet engine and power turbine divisions.\u201cI\u2019m an old mechanical guy,\u201d he said. But a couple of years ago, he issued an edict: no more paper drawings.In the past, a model of a new part would be made and then converted to detailed blueprints running to 70 pages or more. These would then be physically sent to G.E. manufacturing engineers and outside suppliers to begin setting up the tooling, casting and cutting for the part.This prototype-and-blueprint routine took up to eight weeks. Now, engineers use 3-D computer models, skip the prototype step and instantly send the models electronically.This goes a step beyond computer-aided design, which is commonplace. In Greenville, the designers are for the first time linked directly with manufacturers and suppliers in real time, in what G.E. calls a \u201cdigital thread.\u201d This means they can collaborate in ways that have changed the work process while making it more likely that problems or defects are spotted sooner.Traditionally, one set of engineers designed a part, and only then passed it on to manufacturing. If a problem arose on the supplier side, the design was kicked back and the process started over. \u201cJobs are combining in this digital world,\u201d Mr. Lammas said.Greenville\u2019s own equipment has been a Predix guinea pig. The machinery and factory were retrofitted with data-generating sensors and the software. Matt Krause, the plant manager, said that last winter, when a snowstorm shut the factory for a day, the sensor network detected that the plant had consumed 1,000 pounds of argon, an inert gas used in coatings for parts. The leak was fixed, saving $350,000 a year.\u201cWe can see things we never did before,\u201d Mr. Krause said. Over all, 60 of 200 steps in design and production have been automated or eliminated, reducing work time by 530,000 hours over three years, G.E. estimates.Not all the start-up ideas that G.E. is trying to breed translate comfortably to heavy industry. Lean proponents urge companies to come up with \u201cminimum viable products,\u201d particularly test versions of software programs. But no one wants a minimum viable jet engine or power generator.Yet in Greenville, engineers in the design stages are encouraged to move faster in smaller steps, conduct more experiments, and be willing to fail and try again. It amounts to a sea change in the engineering culture of heavy industry.\u201cAs an engineer, not getting it right the first time, I find painful,\u201d said Bill Byrne, an engineering manager. \u201cIt\u2019s uncomfortable. But it\u2019s been incredibly liberating.\u201dThe old ways, said Mr. Lammas, the engineering chief, had merit. Each step and rule was logical on its own. But the emphasis on flawless execution and perfection fostered a fear of failure. \u201cOvercoming that culture was probably the biggest challenge,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Duo Makes Video Calling Between Operating Systems Easier", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixGoogle and Apple have battled each other for years for primacy over mobile users. Apple has proferred its superior devices, like the iPhone. Google has fought back with its Android operating system and a series of mobile apps that are more flexible and compatible with a broader set of devices than Apple\u2019s apps.The app fits squarely into Google\u2019s playbook in mobile. Over the last few years, Google has increasingly offered its important software and internet services, including Google Maps, Google Photos and Google Docs, to iPhone customers. All of those apps were compelling alternatives to Apple\u2019s proprietary apps, like Apple Maps, Photos and Notes, because they work on a wider variety of devices, including Macs, Windows PCs, Android devices and iPhones.Duo is no exception. People can only use FaceTime to call others who have Apple devices. But Duo lets you place video calls between Android and iPhone users, and sizably increases the universe of people with whom you can hold a video conversation.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to worry about whether your call will connect, or if your friend is using the same type of device as you are,\u201d Google said in a statement, in a veiled jab at Apple. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder that nearly half of U.S. adults never make video calls on mobile.\u201dAll of this feeds into Google\u2019s strategy to attract iPhone users over to Android. Google\u2019s apps generally work better on Android devices than on iPhones, so the more that people get hooked on Google\u2019s core apps, the less incentive there is to stay loyal to Apple.Nick Fox, Google\u2019s head of communication products, said the top priority with Duo was to build a great product and to increase the use of video calling among Android users. But he added that making Android more attractive to iPhone owners was a secondary motive. He said that Duo\u2019s appeal was that it was simple to use, fast and more widely accessible.\u201cOur view is video calling should work for everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can only call half the people you know, that\u2019s very limiting.\u201d\u201cOur year-to-date iPhone sales to switchers are the greatest we\u2019ve seen in any nine-month period,\u201d Mr. Cook said in the call, without disclosing precise figures.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment beyond Mr. Cook\u2019s comments.I decided to test Duo to see how the new app plays into the debate about whether iPhone users should consider switching to Android devices. After trying an early copy of Duo and comparing it side by side with FaceTime, I found that Duo was just as intuitive and fun to use as FaceTime, but that it was too early to tell which service was more reliable.A Short HistoryThis is not the first time Google has provided video calling. Google started offering mobile video calling several years ago inside its Hangouts app, which also includes messaging and voice-calling capabilities. The video-calling feature in Hangouts will remain intact.Crystal Dahlen, a Google spokeswoman, said the name Duo conveyed that the app was designed for one-to-one video calling on mobile devices, in contrast to Hangouts, which lets groups of people make video calls over mobile devices and computers. Duo will roll out globally over the next few days.FaceTime, in contrast, is now six years old. When Apple unveiled the video-calling ability in iPhones in 2010, Steven P. Jobs, Apple\u2019s co-founder, said he had dreamed of mobile video calling since he grew up watching \u201cThe Jetsons\u201d and \u201cStar Trek.\u201d Apple later expanded FaceTime to work with iPads and Macs, among other Apple products. The company has not published statistics on FaceTime use, but the technology helped make mobile video calling mainstream.Duo Versus FaceTimeThe Duo app is downloadable and free through Google\u2019s Play store and Apple\u2019s App Store. When you open the Duo app, there is just one button: video call. Tapping that loads your contacts list, and from there you can choose whom to call.Duo starts streaming video to a recipient as soon as the call is placed, meaning the person you are calling will be able to see you waving or making faces before he or she picks up. Google calls this feature Knock Knock. It can be disabled in case you have friends who are likely to make inappropriate hand gestures.With FaceTime, you place a call directly through the iPhone\u2019s contacts list or through the separate FaceTime app. The recipient does not see the video streaming until after the call is answered.I placed video calls over Duo and FaceTime over a strong Wi-Fi connection as well as a weak cellular connection. In the tests, the video calls looked clearer on Duo, though that is an unreliable measure because very few people are currently able to use Duo, so the network is unrealistically uncongested. When more people use Duo, we can expect the picture quality to vary depending on network traffic and internet speeds.There is a minor difference for Duo between Android and iPhone users. An Android user receiving a Duo call will see a Knock Knock video on the home screen by default. Those using Apple devices will see a notification on top of the screen and will have to open the Duo app before seeing Knock Knock in action. Otherwise, the app works the same for both Android and iPhone.Against the RestI also compared Duo calls with video calls placed over Microsoft\u2019s Skype and Facebook Messenger. Against those two, Duo\u2019s simplicity won hands down.In Facebook\u2019s Messenger app, the video-calling feature is embedded in the corner of a message box, so it is hard to find and not intuitive to use. In fact, every call I have ever made with Messenger has been by mistake.On Skype, the video-calling feature is in a place similar to Messenger\u2019s, in the corner of a message box. More annoyingly, to find other Skype users you have to manually add them to your Skype contacts list or toggle on an option to synchronize your address book with Skype.The Bottom LineFor now, FaceTime is just as intuitive as Duo so I see no compelling reason to use Duo over FaceTime to call iPhone users.But if I had to video call an Android user, I would use Duo over other video-calling services like Skype or Facebook Messenger, which have more cluttered interfaces than Duo\u2019s single-button approach.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Concerns Over Rule Banning Sex Offenders From Playing Pok\u00e9mon Go", "Date": "2016-08-21", "News": "Supported byThe list that most sex offenders must sign in order to be granted parole in New York State includes many stipulations, all written in the first person. There are promises to register with local law enforcement, to complete therapy if it is required and to not pick up hitchhikers or visit schools or playgrounds.And at the end there is a new entry: no Pok\u00e9mon Go.\u201cI understand that I shall not download, access, or otherwise engage in any internet-enabled gaming activities to include Pok\u00e9mon Go,\u201d it reads.The appearance of the popular smartphone game \u2014 in which players catch Pok\u00e9mon, digital creatures with names such as Squirtle and Jigglypuff \u2014 on the gloomy bureaucratic document was not a joke or a prank. It was a serious policy enacted by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, this month to protect children who play games over the internet.But advocates for civil liberties said they were skeptical of whether the new stipulation, which would apply to about 3,000 paroled sex offenders in the state, was appropriate.Pok\u00e9mon Go takes the form of a treasure hunt, with a digital map on a cellphone leading a player to real locations \u2014 many of them landmarks \u2014 to try to collect Pok\u00e9mon characters. The augmented reality game splices a digital layer onto the physical world: Pok\u00e9mon appear based on a player\u2019s physical location, and the cartoon creatures are seen through the phone\u2019s camera, creating an image that melds the virtual to the real \u2014 a smiley Bulbasaur near a Central Park fountain, for example.But to State Senators Jeffrey D. Klein and Diane J. Savino, both Democrats, it presented \u201ca virtual road map to our children,\u201d Mr. Klein said in a news release. In an informal investigation, they looked at 100 addresses of registered sex offenders across New York City and found Pok\u00e9mon near 57 of them. And they highlighted an instance in Indiana in which a sex offender was reportedly caught playing the game with a 16-year-old.Mr. Cuomo, in a statement explaining that the order was inspired by the investigation, said, \u201cThese actions will provide safeguards\u201d and \u201chelp take one more tool away from those seeking to do harm to our children.\u201dMr. Cuomo\u2019s office said that the game\u2019s \u201clure\u201d feature, which allows players to attract more Pok\u00e9mon to certain locations, \u201cappears to have the potential to be abused by predators.\u201dStill, Alphonso David, the governor\u2019s chief counsel, said, \u201cWhat we can\u2019t do is suggest that a percentage of children \u2014 even if it\u2019s a small percentage of children \u2014 can\u2019t be protected.\u201dThe list of so-called special conditions to which Pok\u00e9mon Go was added includes prohibitions on parolees owning cameras or cellphones, using the internet or driving anywhere besides work. If parolees, who are subject to unscheduled searches of their home and devices, break any of these provisions, they could end up back in prison. Parole officers can grant dispensation on some of the conditions case by case.\u201cI think that the anonymity of apps like Kik, Snapchat, Instagram and Pok\u00e9mon Go does increase the risk for opportunistic offenders,\u201d she said.Finn Brunton, an assistant professor of media at New York University, described the game as part of a wave of new technology that is breaking down the boundary between real and virtual worlds in unpredictable ways. \u201cCyberspace \u2014 you think of it being this other place, but it\u2019s not that at all anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s the world that surrounds us.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "John Ellenby, Visionary Who Helped Create Early Laptop, Dies at 75", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "Supported byJohn Ellenby, a British-born computer engineer who played a critical role in paving the way for the laptop computer, died on Aug. 17 in San Francisco. He was 75.His son Thomas confirmed the death but said the cause had not been determined.Mr. Ellenby\u2019s pioneering work came to fruition in the early 1980s, after he founded Grid Systems, a company in Mountain View, Calif. As chief executive, he assembled an engineering and design team that included the noted British-born industrial designer William Moggridge.It went on to become a valuable tool for big corporations, government spies, White House and Pentagon officials, and even astronauts, surviving the midair explosion of the space shuttle Challenger in which seven people died.The Compass came with advanced, and expensive, data storage capacity called bubble memory and was accordingly pricey, originally selling for $8,150 ($20,325 today). As a result, it found an enthusiastic market not with consumers but rather in Washington.One version, intended for United States special-operations forces, was said to have come with a red dot on its black magnesium case, placed there as an aiming guide for any commando who might have to shoot the device to destroy its data quickly.Intelligence agencies were also eager buyers; the Compass was marketed as a kind of sexy, high-tech device that might appeal to James Bond.Another user was Vice Adm. John Poindexter, President Ronald Reagan\u2019s national security adviser in the mid-1980s. Admiral Poindexter, a computer hobbyist, would take the laptop with him when Mr. Reagan traveled.He would also spend his free time using the Compass to reprogram the IBM electronic mail system that the White House employed, according to James Opfer, who was director of the White House Communications Agency then and who arranged the first White House purchase of the machines, for $2 million.Mr. Opfer said in an interview that he was \u201c90 percent certain\u201d that for a time, a Compass accompanied the president\u2019s ever-present \u201cnuclear football\u201d \u2014 the device, carried by a military aide, that makes it possible to launch nuclear weapons. \u201cIt was quite heavy,\u201d he recalled.Admiral Poindexter, also in an interview this week, remembered the Grid computers as \u201creally nice machines\u201d that had been \u201cbuilt like an armored tank.\u201d He said that he and Robert C. McFarlane, who preceded him as Mr. Reagan\u2019s national security adviser, had each kept Mr. Reagan\u2019s Compass locked in a home safe.NASA also used one as a backup navigational device in its space shuttle program. One was aboard the Challenger on the morning of Jan. 28, 1986, when a rocket-booster failure destroyed the craft shortly after liftoff from Cape Canaveral in Florida. The Compass, which had been attached to a dashboard with Velcro, was recovered from the debris and found to be still working.John Ellenby was born in Corbridge, in northern England, on Jan. 9, 1941, to Conrad Ellenby, a zoologist, and the former Mary McCarraher, a biologist. He studied economics and geography at University College London and spent a year in the early 1960s studying at the London School of Economics, where he encountered mainframe computers.He later worked for the British computer maker Ferranti and lectured on computing at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. He moved to Northern California in the early 1970s to work for the Xerox Corporation at its Palo Alto Research Center.At the time, Xerox was designing a desktop computer, known as the Alto, which would become an inspiration for the Apple Lisa and Macintosh, and for Microsoft Windows. Inside Xerox, the Alto was known as an \u201cinterim Dynabook,\u201d a reference to the prototype for a portable machine envisioned by the Xerox computer scientist Alan Kay.Mr. Ellenby was instrumental in managing the development of the Alto II, a version of the prototype that could be manufactured more easily. He had earned a reputation as a technologist who was adept at turning technologies into products.\u201cHe was good and aggressive and even daring, you might say,\u201d said David Liddle, a Xerox executive at the time.Mr. Ellenby left Xerox to found Grid in 1979. The move paid off. In addition to his government customers, corporations like Bank of America, Chevron and McKinsey & Company were early buyers.Mr. Weber, the computer historian, said that the name Grid was derived from Mr. Ellenby\u2019s vision of a gridlike network \u2014 a precursor to the internet \u2014 that would connect various computers with one another, allowing them to share files. The idea was to sell the system through a business services company. The company called the system Grid Central.Initially the Compass was so energy-hungry, it required a plug. And the machine took competitors by surprise. One was Adam Osborne, the developer of the Osborne 1, an early portable computer \u2014 a \u201cluggable,\u201d in industry parlance \u2014 about the size of a sewing machine. Appearing with Mr. Ellenby on an industry panel, Mr. Osborne was startled to realize that the device sitting flat on a table nearby was, when it was opened, a portable computer.Mr. Ellenby sold Grid to the Tandy Corporation in March 1988. He went on to start Agilis, a maker of hand-held tablet computers, and, with his son Thomas, GeoVector, which pioneered navigation and augmented-reality applications.In addition to his son Thomas, Mr. Ellenby is survived by another son, Peter, and a granddaughter.In his later years, Mr. Ellenby would reflect on what a huge technical challenge the idea of a portable computer had presented a half-century ago. In an interview, he once related that the inspiration for it came on a visit to the White House.There, he met an official who said he wanted a machine that would include everything that was in a standard business personal computer but that would fit in half the briefcase that Mr. Ellenby was carrying with him at the time. As Mr. Ellenby recalled, \u201cI said: \u2018This briefcase? That\u2019s hard!\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple, Congress and the Missing Taxes", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "Supported byEditorialApple and the United States are crying foul over the ruling in Europe that Apple received illegal tax breaks from Ireland and must hand over 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion), a record tax penalty in Europe.But Apple and the United States have only themselves to blame for the situation.Initially, deferral was a convenience for multinationals, as they sought investment opportunities abroad. Today, it is the taproot of global tax avoidance. Financial engineering has let American companies shift profits into foreign accounts, while they lobby Congress for tax-rate cuts in exchange for repatriating the money. Currently, there is some $2 trillion in corporate profits in offshore tax-deferred accounts; besides Apple, Microsoft, Google, Cisco and Oracle also have large stashes. Apple is one of nearly two dozen major corporations pushing Congress for a \u201ctax holiday,\u201d which would let companies bring back foreign-held money over the course of a year at a discounted tax rate, rather than the current rate, 35 percent.Before the European ruling on Tuesday, the debate over a tax holiday had pitted Republicans, who have generally favored the idea, against Democrats, who have viewed it as an unjustified reward for tax avoidance. The Democrats have history on their side. A tax holiday in 2005 lowered the corporate rate to 5.25 percent, enticing corporations to repatriate some $300 billion. It was billed as a way to create jobs and increase investment, but the money was used mostly for dividend payments, share buybacks (which tend to raise executive pay) and severance for laid-off employees. Worse, the tax holiday inspired multinationals to stash as much money abroad as they possibly could in anticipation of another holiday.The European ruling, however, could sharply alter the terms of the congressional debate. Republicans and Democrats alike have always assumed that foreign-held profits would one day be repatriated. The big question was the rate at which they would ultimately be taxed. Similarly, the Treasury assumes that deferred foreign profits will one day be taxed when it projects future revenues \u2014 an important measure of the nation\u2019s fiscal health.But the money won\u2019t be repatriated and taxed under American law if Europeans, in the course of enforcing their own laws against tax havens, get their hands on it first. And that, in a nutshell, is why members of Congress and Treasury officials are so upset about the Apple ruling. They understand, correctly, that tax-law enforcement in Europe could reduce the sums they expect to collect taxes on someday. What they don\u2019t understand, or aren\u2019t saying, is that they brought the problem on themselves.The way forward is not to declare a tax war with Europe. It is for Congress to agree on a way to tax foreign-held corporate profits. President Obama put forth a reasonable approach in 2015, when he proposed a mandatory 14 percent tax on multinationals\u2019 current offshore profits \u2014 whether they are repatriated or not \u2014 and, thereafter, a new minimum tax rate of 19 percent on profits moved offshore. An even better approach would be to simply end indefinite corporate tax deferral, imposing American taxes on profits when they are made.Republicans rejected Mr. Obama\u2019s proposal in 2015, and there is no chance that lawmakers will engage in such a debate so close to the election. But the next president and Congress will need to act to ensure that at long last, American corporations pay their fair share in taxes.Advertisement"}

Over 300,000 companies around the world use its database, and 100,000 customers have purchased its business applications. Even companies gunning for Oracle \u2014 like Amazon, Google and Salesforce \u2014 have used Oracle\u2019s technology.Besides selling applications more efficiently, he said, Oracle has pooled a large amount of information derived from over 1,500 data providers. \u201cMarketers and brands find this very powerful,\u201d he said in an email, as Oracle targets \u201cover 45,000 different dimensions (demographic, geography, online and offline behavior).\u201dIn other words, what Google and Facebook know based on your online life, as well as what companies learn from your shopping habits, credit and warranty behavior, among other things. Oracle will also have data on what customers do after an ad campaign, so advertisers can check the outcome of a Google ad blitz.The same data-heavy approach can be used in functions of business like procurement, human capital management, sales and service, Mr. Kurian thinks. \u201cWe know how payrolls change around job titles, the rate of salary changes in Silicon Valley versus Bangalore, or how many people in a company are buying a $10 printer cartridge,\u201d he told me in an earlier interview.This data analysis could become a valuable adjunct to many of Oracle\u2019s database and applications businesses.

Oracle may be challenged there, precisely because it has built a big and complicated system of databases, bigger than anything Amazon, Microsoft or Google sells. It has to keep those older customers happy, even as it makes data easier to move around, in and out of the cloud, for different kinds of analysis.In that, Oracle has a powerful and little-noted asset: Despite its reputation as a hard-edge company, it has good engineers with decades of experience.

{"Headline": "Tech Giants Gobble Start-Ups in an Antitrust Blind Spot", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorLike Facebook\u2019s acquisition of WhatsApp, the Walmart deal will probably end up being another example of an upstart internet company being swallowed up to preserve the stranglehold of a giant.This happens because antitrust regulators are stuck in an outdated view of the world, while the internet giants are more attuned to their nascent competitive threats. The deal for Jet.com is just the latest defensive internet acquisition of an emerging start-up that will preserve the hegemony of a select few.And now it is being swallowed up by Walmart.This could be seen as a victory for competition. Walmart will now have a more dynamic management and brand to buttress its own internet sales operation, which trails Amazon by quite a distance. This will allow it to better compete against Amazon. The likely result is that competition in online retailing will eventually be a slugfest between Amazon and Walmart with everyone else thrown by the wayside.The problem with this narrative is that it cements the positions of Walmart and Amazon as the only players in town.This is the modus operandi of the big internet behemoths. They live in fear of new technology disrupting their businesses and killing them off.Mr. Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez was a Facebook product manager when the company faced its greatest threat: Google Plus. Facebook won because it enforced an ethos of all work, all the time, spurred by constant fear of extinction.Facebook and its elite brethren will do anything to make sure they are not the next Yahoo or Radio Shack, killed by disruption and failure to innovate. This translates into paying obscene sums for technology that might challenge their dominance one day.If you don\u2019t believe this, there is a poignant passage in \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d where Mr. Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez notes that Mark Zuckerberg saw that there were two companies with \u201chockey stick growth\u201d that matched Facebook\u2019s own: Instagram and WhatsApp. Both were amassing users at an amazing rate and both were an existential threat to Facebook.Did Mr. Zuckerberg rev up the Facebook machine to try to outcompete them? No. Instead, he bought Instagram for about $1 billion and WhatsApp for an astounding $21.8 billion.Today, Facebook is dominant, with more than 1.7 billion monthly active users. WhatsApp has more than 1 billion monthly active users and Instagram, more than 500 million.Another Google example is YouTube, which was bought for $1.65 billion in 2006 and is now a constant stream of users for Google. Indeed, YouTube, with more than one billion active monthly users, is a top driver of Alphabet\u2019s user growth.Billions of dollars are made in Silicon Valley by selling nascent upstarts to the giants. And the dominant players pay eagerly to remain dominant. That is what is going on with the Jet.com acquisition and perhaps even the $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn by Microsoft.Where are the antitrust authorities in all of this? The guiding standard under the law is that no acquisition should be allowed if it would \u201clessen competition.\u201dUnder the traditional view of antitrust, when Facebook, for example, tries to buy a company like Instagram, it can argue that anyone can start such a website. And there are other competitors like Google and Snapchat. And so this gets past the antitrust authorities, who seem more concerned with how the data will be used rather than the accumulation of users. Both United States and European Union regulators examined the WhatsApp deal, but it passed muster because WhatsApp was viewed as a messenger service, something where there was alternative competition.This misses the point that domination is all about users and views. Those companies with users and page views can dominate, and accumulating those users is everything, something only an infinitesimally small number of companies can find the key to doing.The antitrust system results in the increasing oligopoly that we have, where a few companies dominate major industries, accruing the wealth and power that go with it as potential disrupters are swallowed at birth, the way Cronus, the titan in Greek mythology, ate his young to prevent their uprising.No one knows what might happen to Jet if it remained independent. Perhaps it would fail. Amazon is dominant and Walmart may truly be the only real competitor. The same could be said of any of these acquisitions of high-growth companies. So preventing this acquisition may result not in creating a competitor to Amazon but in the eventual death of Jet. This of course would leave its founder and investors much poorer, a true cost.The flip side of this risk is that the big tech companies continue unchallenged in their dominance. Perhaps it is time to rethink antitrust enforcement, and take the risks associated with a different view of antitrust that looks at potential dominance and at breaking up oligopolies. Rhea protected Zeus from Cronus, which eventually led to Cronus\u2019s destruction.If antitrust authorities do not adapt and emerging competitors continue to be bought up, we should not be surprised of the continued dominance of a very few companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Walmart.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "When Every Company Is a Tech Company, Does the Label Matter?", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "Supported byStrategiesApple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon have created something of a watershed moment in the stock market.They became the four most valuable companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index at the close of trading on Aug. 1, according to S.&P.\u2019s official tally. That meant that tech companies, by one common definition, occupied the four top spots in the market capitalization rankings, a rare and brief occurrence.\u201cIt may never have happened before at the close of trading,\u201d said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. The full history of daily rankings isn\u2019t readily available, however, so we can\u2019t be certain, and such rankings are evanescent, shifting with every tick of the stock market. In fact, on Friday, Amazon dropped back into sixth place.But no matter: The early August rankings were a reminder of how far tech has come. It is a dominant force in the stock market and the economy, one so all-encompassing that tech may no longer even be a useful concept for understanding today\u2019s stock market.One of them is Exxon Mobil, the energy giant and the most valuable company in the S.&P. as recently as 2012. But Exxon Mobil has been cut down in size by the oil price debacle. The other is Berkshire Hathaway, Warren E. Buffett\u2019s conglomerate, which the S.&P. categorizes as a financial services company \u2014 the only such company left in the Top 10 market cap list. Berkshire announced its own earnings after trading closed on Friday. We\u2019ll soon learn whether the market is pleased enough to vault Berkshire further ahead of Amazon.The three tech companies at the very top in market cap \u2014 Apple, Google and Microsoft \u2014 have held high positions for a long while. (Google, ranked second, trades as Alphabet, the name of its parent company.) Google passed Apple in value briefly this year, but Apple regained the top perch, which it has held since 2012. Microsoft, now No. 3, was the most valuable company during the last tech boom, in the early 2000s.Virtually no one disputes S.&P.\u2019s formal classification of Apple, Google and Microsoft as \u201cinformation technology\u201d companies. The same is true of Facebook, which held seventh place in the latest list of most valuable companies. But while Amazon is often described as a tech company \u2014 and undoubtedly uses and creates innovative technology \u2014 S.&P. has never classified it as one.In fact, Amazon is formally known as a \u201cconsumer discretionary company,\u201d like Walmart, which it has displaced as a member of the Top 10 most valuable companies. Amazon is the only consumer discretionary company left in the Top 10. Is it in some sense a tech company? Certainly, and we\u2019ll get back to that.But the same can be said, to one degree or another, about the three other members of the Top 10 \u2014 old companies that are still prospering in large part because of their mastery of advanced technologies. Johnson & Johnson, for example, which is ranked eighth, is a health care company, yet it is heavily involved in technology of a biological kind. Then there is General Electric, the diversified industrial company (and, until recently, also a financial services company), once described as a bellwether for the entire market. It conducts advanced research and sells tech products.Last on the list is AT&T, a telecommunications company, which, in an early form, helped create computer languages and operating systems on which modern tech companies are built. In 1957, when the S.&P. 500 was born, an ancestral version of AT&T was the most valuable company in the United States by a very wide margin, said Jeremy J. Siegel, a Wharton business school professor, the author of \u201cStocks for the Long Run\u201d and a market historian.\u201cAT&T back then was a highly regulated old phone company,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a giant, later broken up into smaller companies. And it was an outlier, because the other big companies in the S.&P. 500 in that era were mainly materials companies \u2014 like United States Steel, DuPont and Union Carbide \u2014 and an awful lot of oil companies.\u201dIn 1957, the economy ran on oil, and the biggest energy company was Standard Oil of New Jersey \u2014 an ancestor of Exxon Mobil. No pure tech company ranked in the Top 10 back then, not even IBM, which soon became the dominant tech company, a position it held until Microsoft surpassed it in the mid-1990s. That was the decade of the great tech boom, culminating in the bubble that burst in March 2000. Microsoft was No. 1 in market cap at the end of 1999, and four other tech companies \u2014 Cisco Systems, Intel, IBM and America Online \u2014 were also among the Top 10 most valuable companies. The stock market celebrated tech\u2019s ascendance then, as it does now.But this is a different era. When you dig deeper into the S.&P. 500, it\u2019s clear that while the valuations of tech companies swelled to unrealistically high proportions in those bubble years, the valuations of most companies are far more modest now. In March 2000, the height of the bubble, the value of information technology companies swelled to 34.5 percent of the total market cap of the S.&P. 500. At the moment, the comparable figure is only 20.7 percent, data from the Bespoke Investment Group shows. That\u2019s not much more than the 15.7 percent share of financial companies or the 15.2 percent share of the health care sector. By contrast, finance ballooned as high as 22.3 percent at the end of 2006, in what can be seen in hindsight as a financial bubble.On the other hand, materials and energy companies, which together constituted almost half of the total value of the S.&P. 500 in 1957, now account for less than 10 percent of it. That reflects the collapse of energy and commodity prices over the last few years, and it may well be a temporary phenomenon. In the meantime, diversified energy companies like Exxon Mobil are investing heavily in technology, a necessity if they are to flourish.It\u2019s clear even to energy companies, in other words, that tech\u2019s abiding power in the marketplace is not temporary. Technology permeates every sector of the economy, even those not formally classified as high-tech. Whether companies like Amazon and Johnson & Johnson should carry tech labels is beside the point. Tech has already taken over.These days every company is a tech company, but some have better niches, faster growth, more attractive offerings or more favorable share prices than others. These kinds of fundamental distinctions will influence the Top 10 rankings of the future.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

Maybe These Devices Should Go Along", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixWHEN Vanessa Arreola, 18, starts her freshman year at Stanford University this fall, the top item on her back-to-school wish list is a MacBook Pro.She said she wouldn\u2019t consider a tablet because she prefers a traditional keyboard. She relies on apps like Google Docs for documents and Google Slides for presentations, which are available through a web browser.\u201cA tablet is just like your cellphone, but bigger,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see a point of getting a tablet.\u201dBut Claire Ashcroft, 19, who studies public health at Brigham Young University in Idaho, said the opposite. Half of her textbooks are digitized, and she uses apps like Microsoft Excel and Word \u2014 so her ideal school device would be a Windows machine with a touch screen, like a Microsoft Surface tablet.The polarizing responses illustrate how back-to-school shopping for technology gadgets has become increasingly complex for parents. In the past, the dilemma for most students was whether to get a Windows PC or a Mac. Now, because of a proliferation of different computing forms with the rise of mobile devices, the debate has shifted toward whether to buy a computer or a tablet \u2014 and which operating system on top of that.Then there are the different types of software and tools that students use, like flashcard apps or readers for digital textbooks, some of which are for mobile devices and others for computers.To make back-to-school season easier, parents should have a conversation with their children about what devices and which operating system to buy based on their student\u2019s area of studies and the apps they use.I also compiled a guide to some of the best back-to-school products, including computers, mobile devices, audio accessories and food gadgets. The list was curated after testing dozens of products and interviewing five college students about the tools that help them do homework and get through cramming sessions. (While this list focuses on college students, many of whom will be getting their own computers for the first time, some items would also be a good fit for high schoolers.)The students I polled were split on whether a laptop or tablet would be the best study tool. In general, students in science-oriented fields would probably benefit from a laptop, which can handle multitasking more easily and run more powerful apps than tablets. For designers and liberal arts majors who are using more lightweight apps for writing essays or drawing sketches, a tablet may be a better fit.There are two caveats. First, Apple is expected to release a brand-new iPhone this fall; so if you go the Apple route, it would be wise to wait a few months. Second, these are high-end phones that cost roughly $700, which could easily blow your budget.High-quality audio gear is a sound investment for students. Roommates can be loud distractions from schoolwork and sleep, plus a bit of music can ease the pain of typing out a tedious essay.Speaking of water kettles, a food gadget or two will not go amiss in students\u2019 lives, especially if the devices offer a shortcut to downing some caffeine or gobbling up ramen.But she would like a Microsoft Surface tablet.\u201cIf we\u2019re talking wishful here, I would choose that,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a couple of friends with those, and I think they\u2019re pretty nice.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the maker of the Nexus 6P.

{"Headline": "How Think Tanks Amplify Corporate America\u2019s Influence", "Date": "2016-08-07", "News": "Supported by\u201cThis can become a productive, mutually beneficial relationship,\u201d Bruce Katz, a Brookings vice president, wrote to Lennar in July 2010. The ultimate benefit for Brookings: $400,000 in donations from Lennar\u2019s different divisions.\u201cHe would be a trusted adviser,\u201d an internal Brookings memo said in 2014 as the think tank sought one $100,000 donation from Lennar.Think tanks, which position themselves as \u201cuniversities without students,\u201d have power in government policy debates because they are seen as researchers independent of moneyed interests. But in the chase for funds, think tanks are pushing agendas important to corporate donors, at times blurring the line between researchers and lobbyists. And they are doing so while reaping the benefits of their tax-exempt status, sometimes without disclosing their connections to corporate interests.Similar arrangements exist at many think tanks. On issues as varied as military sales to foreign countries, international trade, highway management systems and real estate development, think tanks have frequently become vehicles for corporate influence and branding campaigns.The shift has occurred as nonprofits in general have been under increasing pressure from their donors to meet specific goals. But for think tanks, that pressure can threaten their standing as independent arbiters in policy debates in Congress, the White House and the news media.\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice to go back to the greatest generation, in the post-World War II era of philanthropy, where they said, gosh, \u2018Here is $1 million; spend it how you wish,\u2019\u201d Kimberly Churches, the managing director at Brookings, said in an interview.Think tank executives reject any suggestion that they are tools of corporate influence campaigns and say they are simply teaming up with donors that have similar goals, like helping cities with economic development.But he acknowledged that the arrangement to appoint the Lennar executive as a senior fellow had created the \u201cappearance of a conflict of interest.\u201d And he said that Brookings, in the interest of transparency, had recently decided to prohibit corporations or corporate-backed foundations from making anonymous contributions.Still, the benefits afforded to corporations looking to cloak themselves with the authority of think tanks are strikingly evident, according to a review of documents from more than a dozen institutions.The likely conclusions of some think tank reports, documents show, are discussed with donors \u2014 or even potential ones \u2014 before the research is complete. Drafts of the studies have been shared with donors whose opinions have then helped shape final reports. Donors have outlined how the resulting scholarship will be used as part of broader lobbying efforts. The think tanks also help donors promote their corporate brands, as Brookings does with JPMorgan Chase, whose $15.5 million contribution is the largest by a private corporation in the institution\u2019s history.Despite these benefits, corporations can write off the donations as charitable contributions. Some tax experts say these arrangements may amount to improper subsidies by taxpayers if think tanks are providing specific services.The Brookings Institution \u2014 long recognized as one of the most prestigious think tanks in the world \u2014 has aggressively courted corporate donors over the last decade, particularly for its Metropolitan Policy Program, which formed partnerships with JPMorgan Chase, Lennar Corporation, K.K.R., Hitachi and others. Here is an examination of the deals with these donors, based in part on thousands of pages of internal Brookings documents.Executives at Brookings, the Center for Strategic and International Studies and other think tanks say they have systems in place to ensure that their reports are based on scholars\u2019 independent conclusions.\u201c\u2018Are you going to say drones are bad?\u2019\u201d she recalled one potential financial backer asking. \u201c\u2018We are not interested in funding something that says drones are bad.\u2019\u201dThe confidential Brookings spreadsheet had an unassuming title: Corporate Overviews Tracking. It listed nearly 90 corporations, from Alcoa to Wells Fargo, providing a glimpse of the vast electronic file that Brookings maintained on donors and prospects, and the benefits it might offer.The database, along with thousands of pages of emails, solicitations for money and memos on meetings with corporate officials, highlighted Brookings\u2019s practice of assuring that donors would see results from their contributions.The files included company priorities and a tally of donations. General Electric wanted to fund work on rail networks and clean energy programs \u2014 both critical parts of its business \u2014 and Brookings then featured G.E. executives, joined by officials from the White House and Congress, at events that focused on these industries.From the start, the program blended a variety of insights on urban matters, including from corporate, nonprofit and government sources. And Mr. Indyk noted that any reports issued were made public.Donations to the program exploded, from $4.3 million in 2005 to $12.5 million in 2013, nearly 20 percent of Brookings\u2019s overall program spending that year.In advance of a 2014 event Brookings officials attended with corporate executives including Henry R. Kravis, a co-chairman of K.K.R., one memo marked as confidential noted: \u201cK.K.R. has given a total of $350K to Brookings. Last gift came in on 3/27/2014 for $150K to Metro; Henry has donated $75K to Brookings, most going to the individual unrestricted fund.\u201dThe tally demonstrates the important distinction that Brookings makes between \u201cunrestricted\u201d donations, which the think tank can spend on any research, and project-based funding restricted to specific topics that the donor has a particular interest in.The San Francisco project generated controversy from the beginning, with critics concerned about toxic waste left by the former Navy shipyard.A spokesman for Lennar, Glenn Bunting, disputed claims that the company had donated to Brookings out of self-interest \u2014 and said the alliance was not related to the protests.\u201cThere was nothing needed in the way of assistance for Lennar to \u2018buy\u2019 from Brookings,\u201d Mr. Bunting said in an email. Brookings, though, continued to promote the project.The think tank soon delivered.But Mr. Indyk acknowledged that naming Mr. Bonner, who declined to be interviewed, a Brookings nonresident scholar had \u201ccreated the impression that because Lennar was giving money, he was getting the title.\u201d His post, which was unpaid, was not renewed.Officials at Brookings said they had not lobbied for Hitachi, and they provided examples of reports that they said included conclusions challenging the company\u2019s position. \u201cHelping a corporation\u2019s for-profit agenda is not in any way our agenda,\u201d Ms. Churches, the managing director, said.Yet Ms. Churches also said the contract language with donors like Lennar and Hitachi was \u201cinelegant,\u201d although not improper.When asked if the documents read like a fee-for-service agreement, she said, \u201cIt could be misconstrued.\u201dMr. Indyk said Brookings had recently changed its policies so that \u201ctoday, there is no way in which those words would be used in our documents.\u201dThe project was premised on a common interest between the bank and the think tank. Brookings wanted to promote economic growth in cities by encouraging international trade, and JPMorgan wanted to gain new business by offering loans to companies in the same markets.Mr. Indyk and executives from JPMorgan said the company and the think tank simply agreed on a worthy agenda.\u201cThis was about growing the economy, and we are incredibly proud of the results of this initiative,\u201d said Peter Scher, the head of the corporate responsibility program at JPMorgan. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s had a huge impact in more than 30 cities that are involved.\u201dAt the same time, hundreds of pages of memos \u2014 status reports to JPMorgan, internal reports by Brookings staff to prepare for meetings with top bank executives, and formal documents soliciting more money \u2014 make clear that Brookings saw the Global Cities Initiative as a branding effort that could help JPMorgan bolster its standing in cities.And Brookings was ready to do its part.At times, Brookings officials seemed worried they were not doing enough for the bank.\u201cNo one wants to create overt marketing opportunities for JPMC, but we need to carve out roles and thought leadership opportunity for market presidents,\u201d said a 2013 Brookings memo, referring to a dinner with the bank\u2019s executives. \u201cWe need to do a better job tying it back to JPMC.\u201dIt remains difficult to assess whether the relationship helped the bank\u2019s business, but Mr. Scher said that was not the goal.\u201cIf the Global Cities Initiative strengthens the economic competitiveness of cities, it\u2019s a win for small businesses, job creation and everyone involved in these communities, including us,\u201d Mr. Scher said in a statement.Donations from the corporations to Brookings are tax exempt based on the premise that the think tank\u2019s work benefits the public good, not a company\u2019s bottom line.\u201cTax deductions are subsidies that are paid for by all taxpayers,\u201d Ms. Fleischer said. \u201cAnd the reason the subsidy is provided is that the charitable organization is supposed to be doing something for the public good, not that specifically benefits the private individual or corporation in the form of providing them goods or services.\u201dMr. Indyk said that opinion was \u201ctotally unfounded,\u201d noting that Brookings had retained its own lawyers to review the documents and found no problems.Other think tanks have been even more closely aligned with corporate agendas.The Atlantic Council, which has seen its annual revenue grow to $21 million from $2 million in the last decade, offers access to United States and foreign government officials in exchange for contributions. Individual donors, like FedEx, have also helped fund specific reports that align with their agendas.Six months before the Atlantic Council report was issued, FedEx and the think tank worked on plans to use the report as a lobbying tool.FedEx and the Atlantic Council, working with the European American Chamber of Commerce, also told companies being asked to participate in the study that the goal was to \u201cemphasize the positive impact that a comprehensive agreement would have on American and European small businesses.\u201dAn executive vice president at FedEx, Rajesh Subramaniam, attended an event at Atlantic Council headquarters in Washington to celebrate the release of the final report. So did a key supporter, Representative Erik Paulsen, Republican of Minnesota.Frederick Kempe, the Atlantic Council president, said that FedEx had donated just $20,000 to help fund the effort and that the staff at the Atlantic Council had handled the research.\u201cThere is no doubt the work of think tanks has more credibility than the work of lobbyists, but the only way we preserve it is through intellectual independence,\u201d Mr. Kempe said.General Atomics, the California-based manufacturer of Predator drones, had a clear problem. Prospects for sales were falling as the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq wound down. The company wanted the Obama administration to change its policy to allow for sales to other countries, a lucrative proposition.At about that time, the industry turned to the Center for Strategic and International Studies for help, providing money that the think tank used to conduct a study on drone policy, including exports.While defense contracting giants like Lockheed Martin and Boeing have cumulatively donated at least $77 million since 2010 to two dozen think tanks, disclosure records show, General Atomics\u2019s contribution to the Center for Strategic and International Studies was quite small \u2014 in the tens of thousands of dollars.As General Atomics was lobbying for a change in export rules governing its unmanned aerial vehicles, it helped fund a report at the Center for Strategic and International Studies that also pushed for the change.As a think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies did not file a lobbying report, but the goals of the effort were clear.Boeing and Lockheed Martin, drone makers that were major C.S.I.S. contributors, were also invited to attend the sessions, the emails show. The meetings and research culminated with a report released in February 2014 that reflected the industry\u2019s priorities.\u201cI came out strongly in support of export,\u201d Mr. Brannen, the lead author of the study, wrote in an email to Kenneth B. Handelman, the deputy assistant secretary of state for defense trade controls.But the effort did not stop there.Mr. Brannen, who has since left C.S.I.S., declined to comment. The think tank insisted that its efforts to influence administration policy were not lobbying.\u201cC.S.I.S. will not represent any donor before any government office or entity, including congressional lawmakers and executive branch officials,\u201d Mr. Hamre, the chief executive, said in his statement to The Times. \u201cWe do not lobby.\u201dOne thing is clear: The result was a victory for General Atomics.A State Department spokesman said that while the government officials involved in the review had received opinions from think tanks and industry officials, \u201cat the end of the day, this is a considered U.S. government policy.\u201dLater, after he had joined the Hudson Institute and helped create the Center for American Seapower, he approached Huntington officials again, and they were interested.\u201cA think tank has more prestige,\u201d Mr. McGrath said.Huntington Ingalls paid $100,000 to fund the work, a critical commitment for Mr. McGrath, who said he was paid by Hudson only if he could successfully solicit donations to support his research.Mr. McGrath said he had always been a strong proponent of aircraft carriers, so the company was not buying his opinion.\u201cThe Hudson Center makes no secret about being very pro-sea power,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a company came that wanted us to write a piece that advocated for something other than that, the answer would be no.\u201dIn exchange for Huntington Ingalls\u2019s support, company officials were given regular briefings on the research and the opportunity to suggest revisions to early drafts, Mr. McGrath said.Huntington Ingalls, the sole builder of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers in the United States, and other players in the shipbuilding industry were looking for ways to increase or maintain funding for the construction of these giant ships. They turned to think tanks for help. Here is a look at the strategy, which involved the Hudson Institute and others.\u201cWe have an iterative process already laid out in which we will sit down with them and go through drafts and discuss where we are going,\u201d Mr. McGrath said. He added that he had not accepted all of the company\u2019s suggestions.The strategy \u2014 lining up think tank reports as lobbying tools that echoed each other \u2014 was backed up with a series of letters to the editor, dozens of posts on Twitter and Facebook, and op-ed pieces.Mr. McGrath said he, too, wondered if this storm of industry-funded work might be threatening the integrity of the process.\u201cI see a lot of stuff that comes out in Washington,\u201d Mr. McGrath said, \u201cand I got to scratch my head and say, \u2018That guy must be on the payroll.\u2019\u201dBrooke Williams is a reporter at the New England Center for Investigative Reporting, which collaborated with The New York Times on this series.

{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Emoji Gun Control", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorOne change in particular, though, is not delighting everyone. Apple\u2019s new suite of operating systems appears to replace its pistol emoji, which was an image of a six-shooter, with a squirt gun.Apple\u2019s change is ill considered because it breaks the conceptual compatibility that Unicode is meant to establish. Anyone with an iPhone ought to be able to send a message to someone with another company\u2019s products \u2014 like Google or Microsoft or Samsung \u2014 and have what\u2019s delivered communicate the same idea as what\u2019s sent. But with this change, a squirt gun sent from an iPhone will turn into a handgun when received by an Android device, and vice versa.Those behind the campaign to remove the gun from the phone do not appear to be relying on arguments about kids\u2019, or everyone else\u2019s, malleability. Rather, they have portrayed it as a traditional grass-roots messaging campaign: \u201cBy removing the gun emoji,\u201d they write, \u201cwe\u2019ll show America wants stricter access to real guns.\u201d Apple is surely free to favor gun control as a matter of corporate policy \u2014 but it should not be tinkering with our right to express either that or a contrary view on worldwide platforms.It need not be this way. Rather, our devices already enable tech-savvy individuals to invent new emoji-like graphics to send their friends \u2014 and that their friends in turn can pass on to others. Those that attain extensive use could then be standardized in a routine way through Unicode and made available to everyone.Apple, Microsoft, Google and other \u201cbig tech\u201d companies should not be placed in a position, which they themselves do not want, of having to decide which words or emojis do and don\u2019t represent their brand. Apple should be no more responsible if someone uses a gun image in the abstract than if someone happens to type the word \u201cgun.\u201dAs free citizens, we acquiesce to infantilizing digital infrastructure at our peril.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cloud Computing Brings Sprawling Centers, but Few Jobs, to Small Towns", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "Supported byBoydton JournalBOYDTON, Va. \u2014 A giant Microsoft facility just outside this very small town hides behind a quarter-mile berm and a guard house, across the highway from the rubble of a demolished prison.Behind the berm, six unmarked hangars each hold tens of thousands of computer servers. Microsoft has cleared enough scrub trees and vines for at least 15 of these buildings, and six more are already under construction.One thing there isn\u2019t much of at this Microsoft complex, one single computer data center, is long-term work. Microsoft says it might have \u201cseveral dozen\u201d employees in a place like this. They are mostly elite computer workers who tend not to come from Boydton, which lost a lot of good jobs when nearby factories closed and the prison shut down.So it is in a number of small towns across the country, as technology giants like Amazon, Google and Microsoft race to build networks of unprecedented size to provide services over the internet, a technology trend known as cloud computing. Local people, along with many economists and officials, often think these data centers are a key to an industrial revival. But the reality is less impressive.\u201cI\u2019ve worked on a lot of nuclear power plants, and these things are a lot bigger than that,\u201d said E. W. Gregory, the head of the local electrical workers\u2019 union. But \u201cthe first thing they put in was a guard shack and a fence. I\u2019ve filled rooms with people looking for entry-level work. None of it lasts.\u201dThe companies come to places like Boydton for basics like land, water and electricity. Even with low local wages, people are a high-cost item. As small as the staffs at these mammoth facilities are, companies say, perhaps a third of the company jobs will eventually be filled by robots.Google started building in eastern Oregon to be near cheap hydroelectric power on the Columbia River, and most recently it has focused on Iowa, Alabama and Tennessee. Microsoft has a center in Wyoming, and it bought a nine-hole golf course as part of a complex near West Des Moines, Iowa. Amazon recently built similar giant facilities on the outer reaches of Columbus, Ohio, and Dulles, Va.\u201cA lot of this stuff is put in rural parts of the country that used to be part of a manufacturing economy\u201d that has gone overseas, said Bill Coughran, a partner at the venture investment firm Sequoia Capital who ran much of Google\u2019s big engineering for eight years. \u201cTextiles and furniture created a big power grid in the south. Then those jobs went away.\u201dThat\u2019s been the story for Boydton, population 430, in the middle of tobacco country a few miles from the North Carolina border. The prison across from the Microsoft center closed in 2012. A nearby Burlington Industries textile plant that employed more than 2,000 shut in 2002. It was razed in 2012.The South Virginia tobacco economy collapsed as Americans cut back on smoking. But in 1999, Virginia used some of the $4.1 billion it received in a settlement with cigarette makers to build high-speed fiber-optic lines throughout the region.The broadband drew Microsoft, along with some financial perks. Mecklenburg County, which received $2.1 million from the state for the project, has given Microsoft 350 acres and offset personal property taxes by 82.5 percent, according to Wayne Carter, the county administrator.Initially, Apple, which is building a big cloud center for consumers\u2019 photos and music, wanted the Boydton site, but it went across the border to North Carolina, which promised tax breaks on its data center equipment. Not to be outdone, Virginia passed laws in 2009 and 2010 that exempted sales taxes on things like data center computer servers, software, power generators and chillers to cool all that equipment.\u201cWe\u2019ve had six years of construction work,\u201d said Mr. Carter. That has helped the county, he said, because even temporary workers rent houses, stay in hotels and eat in local restaurants.Microsoft did not dispute reports that it would spend $1.1 billion on the Boydton data center, and said that \u201con average, data centers employ tens to several dozen people,\u201d in a mixture of corporate and contracted positions. It declined to let a reporter tour the site.\u201cThey talked about 100 jobs, but it\u2019s a slow process,\u201d said Thomas C. Coleman III, the mayor of Boydton. So far, he says, the biggest impact \u201chas been a couple of lunch tables at the Triangle gas station.\u201dHe understates matters, but not by much. Mr. Gregory, the electrician, said his union had hundreds of applicants for work digging ditches and laying pipe, starting at $10.88 an hour. Wiring paid $28.59. Both jobs tended to last about six months, he said, with lots of attrition for the hard outdoor labor.Working as a security guard or as someone testing the wires inside the data center offers better money, but there are not many positions. Microsoft prefers to fly in its own specialists for some work, and it doesn\u2019t like hiring people who have worked in other big companies\u2019 cloud-computing centers, Mr. Gregory said. (Microsoft said it did not exclude candidates based on previous experience.)\u201cWe can provide a place to live, but all those contractors will move on to the next town where they\u2019re building,\u201d Mr. Coleman said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you can count on.\u201dThe big cloud networks are immensely profitable for the few companies who can operate these global systems. The biggest three cloud companies estimate that the global market in business computing is worth $1 trillion or more, and they are rushing to expand globally. In interviews, all said they spend more than $2 billion annually on this.\u201cIt\u2019s phenomenal how rapidly they are growing,\u201d said Erik Brynjolfsson, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has written extensively on the impact of new technologies. \u201cIt is the key enabler of all kinds of technology advances, starting with the things companies do now, but lots cheaper, including outsourcing tech jobs.\u201dThat is hard to imagine in places where local roots go so deep. Conversations here usually start with people explaining where they are from, and what their families did here for generations. \u201cBoydton is the quintessential quaint courthouse town,\u201d said Leigh Lambert, the town librarian. \u201cPeople from here love it. It feels like it\u2019s always with you.\u201dMs. Lambert grew up nearby, tried New York, and returned to work next to the court, which is adorned with a statue of a Confederate soldier. Microsoft initially came to a couple of town meetings, and it seemed to offer a way Boydton could come back. \u201cNow they\u2019re off by themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cWe hear they have a really nice Starbucks machine.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It also says that cellphone makers are free to use Android-based services provided by rivals. Google does not make money directly from licensing the mobile operating system to companies, but it takes a cut from advertisements displayed on online searches.The Indian officials suggested that the company was abusing its dominant market position by ranking its services ahead of those of competitors in Google search, according to people with knowledge of the report, which has not been made public.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Concerns Over Rule Banning Sex Offenders From Playing Pok\u00e9mon Go", "Date": "2016-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe list that most sex offenders must sign in order to be granted parole in New York State includes many stipulations, all written in the first person. There are promises to register with local law enforcement, to complete therapy if it is required and to not pick up hitchhikers or visit schools or playgrounds.And at the end there is a new entry: no Pok\u00e9mon Go.\u201cI understand that I shall not download, access, or otherwise engage in any internet-enabled gaming activities to include Pok\u00e9mon Go,\u201d it reads.The appearance of the popular smartphone game \u2014 in which players catch Pok\u00e9mon, digital creatures with names such as Squirtle and Jigglypuff \u2014 on the gloomy bureaucratic document was not a joke or a prank. It was a serious policy enacted by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, this month to protect children who play games over the internet.But advocates for civil liberties said they were skeptical of whether the new stipulation, which would apply to about 3,000 paroled sex offenders in the state, was appropriate.Pok\u00e9mon Go takes the form of a treasure hunt, with a digital map on a cellphone leading a player to real locations \u2014 many of them landmarks \u2014 to try to collect Pok\u00e9mon characters. The augmented reality game splices a digital layer onto the physical world: Pok\u00e9mon appear based on a player\u2019s physical location, and the cartoon creatures are seen through the phone\u2019s camera, creating an image that melds the virtual to the real \u2014 a smiley Bulbasaur near a Central Park fountain, for example.But to State Senators Jeffrey D. Klein and Diane J. Savino, both Democrats, it presented \u201ca virtual road map to our children,\u201d Mr. Klein said in a news release. In an informal investigation, they looked at 100 addresses of registered sex offenders across New York City and found Pok\u00e9mon near 57 of them. And they highlighted an instance in Indiana in which a sex offender was reportedly caught playing the game with a 16-year-old.Mr. Cuomo, in a statement explaining that the order was inspired by the investigation, said, \u201cThese actions will provide safeguards\u201d and \u201chelp take one more tool away from those seeking to do harm to our children.\u201dMr. Cuomo\u2019s office said that the game\u2019s \u201clure\u201d feature, which allows players to attract more Pok\u00e9mon to certain locations, \u201cappears to have the potential to be abused by predators.\u201dStill, Alphonso David, the governor\u2019s chief counsel, said, \u201cWhat we can\u2019t do is suggest that a percentage of children \u2014 even if it\u2019s a small percentage of children \u2014 can\u2019t be protected.\u201dThe list of so-called special conditions to which Pok\u00e9mon Go was added includes prohibitions on parolees owning cameras or cellphones, using the internet or driving anywhere besides work. If parolees, who are subject to unscheduled searches of their home and devices, break any of these provisions, they could end up back in prison. Parole officers can grant dispensation on some of the conditions case by case.\u201cI think that the anonymity of apps like Kik, Snapchat, Instagram and Pok\u00e9mon Go does increase the risk for opportunistic offenders,\u201d she said.Finn Brunton, an assistant professor of media at New York University, described the game as part of a wave of new technology that is breaking down the boundary between real and virtual worlds in unpredictable ways. \u201cCyberspace \u2014 you think of it being this other place, but it\u2019s not that at all anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s the world that surrounds us.\u201dAdvertisement"}
