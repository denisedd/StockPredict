{"Headline": "When a Writing Opportunity Knocks, Answer", "Date": "2016-12-16", "News": "Supported byOn WorkAfter graduate school, I moved back to Boston, where I\u2019d spent my undergraduate years. I\u2019d just earned a master\u2019s degree in creative writing from Stanford University and was pumped with literary ambition.At Stanford, reading our stuff to a roomful of serious talent taught us, among other things, the humility of rewriting. Being open to revisions made our work better. But I was soon to discover that suppleness on the page was nothing compared with the real world, where survival depended on being adaptable in very different ways.To finance my first novel, I took a job at an advertising agency on Newbury Street, writing radio commercials for Oxford Pickles and ads for extra-large men\u2019s shoes. It was a tiny four-person shop, so when we signed a large suburban furniture store, we were ecstatic about having nabbed a big account that would secure our futures \u2014 until early one spring morning, when the store\u2019s owner was shot dead in his doorway. The shooter was never found. My novel was never published. I left the agency and became a writer for hire.Dan obliged, and they picked up the script and then Fox sent an \u201cadvance man\u201d to hire a location manager for the production. Neither of us knew what a location manager did, but Dan was bad at directions, so he asked if I wanted the gig. I turned it down. I must have had something better to do, like jog around Fresh Pond. But I swear to God, as I walked out of my apartment in Cambridge, I felt two giant invisible hands on my shoulders forcing me to stop, turn around, call Dan back and say yes.It turned out to be a propitious call. The advance man, 20 years older, was a self-effacing sweetheart who became the fixer when anything went wrong, which was often. We traveled in style, driving the picture car, a rented sedan carefully chosen to match the vehicle being used on set in Los Angeles. The advance man was loaded with per diem money to spend, so we ate in places I\u2019d never dreamed of, beginning at the famed Jimmy\u2019s Harborside.My idea of a big splurge on a night out on my dime would be a single Bloody Mary, but the advance man could afford to buy me as many as I liked. He had four or five vodka martinis, no olive, and after, despite my expert directions on how to get out of the parking lot, drove the picture car into a pole.One day, we took photos on Boston Common in the freezing rain until his camera broke, twice, and we had to drive back to Cambridge to get my Nikon. Of all things, it was St. Patrick\u2019s Day, and so we landed at Dunfey\u2019s in the heart of downtown: green beer and secretaries in green suits wearing green carnations drinking green cr\u00e8me de menthes. A trio sang Irish songs. The advance man got up and danced a jig with the waiter. Before he left for the West Coast, he said he wanted to marry me. But he must have been kidding, because he was already married. Right?When the production company arrived to start shooting, it was clear the job description of location manager was just as ad-lib as scouting with the advance man had been. Among my tasks was getting hot tea for the director \u2014 not as simple as it sounds in the days before Starbucks \u2014 and going up with the crew in a helicopter to point out aerial shots.One morning, I found myself driving during rush hour on the insane Tobin Bridge while a cameraman filmed from the back seat and the production manager kept shouting: \u201cDon\u2019t stop short. You\u2019ll put out his eye!\u201dMy driving skills did not hold up under pressure. As the sun set over Charlestown and we were losing the light, they threw me into the picture car to play James\u2019s mother picking him up from school. I was so nervous that I drove up on the curb.My biggest challenge on set was when I was told to stop the clock in the tower of some famous pre-Revolutionary historical church. We had to take shots of James\u2019s double as he entered the T station over and over, and so in the name of continuity, the great hands of time had to be stilled. I marched into the church, located the priest, and made a completely unauthorized offer of \u201ca donation\u201d on behalf of the movie company if he\u2019d arrange to have the clock stopped for an hour. It cost the studio $50.NBC approved the pilot, and \u201cJames at 15\u201d was picked up as a series that ran for two years. Dan Wakefield moved to Los Angeles and became a story consultant on the show. He and his girlfriend settled into a swell little cottage in West Hollywood, Calif., and late one night, he called me back in Cambridge, no doubt cradling one of those huge, late-\u201970s goblets of wine.\u201cApril,\u201d he said, \u201cthis is the only two weeks in my life when I\u2019ll have any power. If you come out to L.A. right now, I can get you a job writing a script on a TV show.\u201dIn my grandiose na\u00efvet\u00e9, I again turned down the offer of stardom. By then I\u2019d published a couple of short stories, which made me a certified literary personage \u2014 while still writing ad copy, by the way.Months later, I went out to California on vacation, just to visit Dan and with no intention of writing for television. The second day I was there, by pure chance, I met the executive in charge of television programming at 20th Century Fox. He had a massive office decorated like the Arizona desert, with huge succulents and priceless antique Navajo art. He\u2019d had an idea for a pilot, and after five minutes of chitchat decided the kid from back east should be the one to write it. On the spot, he gave me my first TV writing assignment and an office on the back lot.\u201cWas that real?\u201d I later asked Dan.\u201cDon\u2019t ask me what\u2019s real,\u201d replied the Hollywood veteran.Adaptability is the byword for authors in the technological age; to flip at warp speed from print to digital, bookstores to algorithms, while dealing with a flood of competing product not seen since Noah. But there will always be the \u201cexternal factor,\u201d as they say in marketing, that rocks your world. After that meeting at 20th Century Fox, I took a furnished apartment in Marina del Rey, Calif., and only went back to Cambridge to pack.The pilot was never made, but as a result of working on the studio lot, I was fixed up on a blind date on which I met my husband of 37 years. He is a psychotherapist now, but he was a lyricist then, and the music business was a big part of our lives, which is why perhaps the lyrics to Santana\u2019s \u201cYou Are My Kind\u201d keep echoing when I think about the fickleness of starting out:April Smith is the author of the forthcoming thriller \u201cHome Sweet Home,\u201d as well as the historical novel \u201cA Star for Mrs. Blake\u201d and the F.B.I. Special Agent Ana Grey mysteries. She is also a television writer and producer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Honeymoon Begins: Confidence in the Economy Is Booming", "Date": "2016-12-09", "News": "Supported byConsumers say they are more confident. Business leaders, once wary, are now expressing excitement that one of their own is headed toward the White House. And Wall Street is bordering on the ecstatic.A month after Donald J. Trump\u2019s election, a series of pro-business cabinet nominations, along with promises to cut taxes, roll back regulations, invest in infrastructure and negotiate better trade deals, have conjured up the possibility, some executives say, of a \u201cField of Dreams\u201d economy.The recent heart-pumping stock rally, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan Chase, said at an investment conference this week, is \u201cbased upon the hope, which I hope is accurate, that the Trump administration will be very good for unleashed business per se,\u201d and may improve overall growth.Mr. Dimon and a raft of other Wall Street stalwarts have either joined the new administration or taken on advisory roles, damping down their worries that the bankers-as-boogeymen campaign language would be transformed into action.The economic field that Mr. Trump and Republican leaders are building could have widely different effects on bankers, business owners and workers, depending on their skill level, industry and location. Possibly even their race or ethnicity, considering the president-elect\u2019s attacks on immigrants and Muslims.The months between the election and the inauguration of any new president, particularly one from the opposing party, are always swollen with anticipation. While Trump critics and skeptics brace for their worst, supporters can happily indulge their hopes for the best.The bitter political divide continues, but its impact on the economic outlook is not as sharp.With Republicans about to take control of both the White House and Congress, business expects an end to the Washington stalemate and a shift in policies in its direction.\u201cUncertainty about the regulatory environment and tax policy is what can cause paralysis,\u201d said Dan Houston, chief executive of Principal Financial Group, a financial management company headquartered in Des Moines. \u201cJust understanding what the ground rules are going to be can make a difference. There seems to be a feeling that there\u2019s going to be more clarity in the first half of 2017.\u201dCentral Iowa has already been booming with one of the lowest unemployment rates and highest growth rates in the country. But employers have been further buoyed since the election by the belief that imminent tax cuts and fewer regulations will further rev up the economy, Mr. Houston said.\u201cIf you are a Republican, this is the beginning of a golden age,\u201d Mr. Sabato said.With unemployment falling and wage gains picking up in the last couple of years, Democrats were growing much more upbeat about the economy. Some are now more pessimistic, with Pew showing those who think the economy will get better next year declining to 15 percent from 35 percent. But that drop was not enough to offset the Republican surge.\u201cIs it just two ships passing in the night?\u201d Mr. Sabato asked about the sudden enthusiasm about the economy.But Wall Street and business are particularly pumped by the prospect of an end to Washington gridlock. Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chief executive of the private equity giant Blackstone and chairman of Mr. Trump\u2019s panel of business experts, said at an investor conference that change was coming.\u201cI anticipate with a pretty high level of confidence that this stuff is going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this is as big a change happening all at once \u2014 I\u2019ve been in finance for, I don\u2019t know, 45 years? This would be the biggest.\u201dBut it is also true that Blackstone, with its giant portfolio of real estate assets and operating companies that span the world, is closely attuned to the American economy\u2019s potential to grow.The industrial sector is also enthusiastic. Listen to Jay Timmons, president and chief executive of the National Association of Manufacturers: \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for a builder and leader like President-elect Trump to take a proactive, hands-on and personal approach to supporting manufacturers in America.\u201dIn any case, celebration or despair over next year\u2019s economy is not only premature, it is also not easily controlled. In fact, most of the seeds for its performance in the near future have already been sown.\u201cWhatever happened in the economy in the last few weeks or months,\u201d Mr. Wilkof of Stark Industrial in Ohio said, \u201cdidn\u2019t just happen in the last few weeks or months.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s been a steady decline in jobless claims, and the unemployment rolls continue to diminish,\u201d he added. \u201cI think the economy is not in a bad position now. My hope is that it is going to grow and be strong.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ensuring a Future for Lace", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byA staff member at Sophie Hallette working on some lace.But what these century-old industrial monsters turn out is the most delicate of materials \u2014 Chantilly lace, Leavers lace, silk tulle \u2014 in a relatively limited supply, making Sophie Hallette a favorite supplier for luxury fashion houses such as Chanel, Gucci and Erdem.The romantic rose-and-shamrock-patterned lace that the designer Sarah Burton of Alexander McQueen used for Kate Middleton\u2019s wedding gown came from Sophie Hallette, as did the lace for Amal Clooney\u2019s Oscar de la Renta wedding dress. It was a pattern known as Marilyn, after its original famous wearer, Marilyn Monroe.And thanks to a substantial cash infusion by Chanel last spring, \u201cthis beautiful product will be made for decades to come,\u201d the Chanel fashion president, Bruno Pavlovsky, said during an interview at the fashion brand headquarters in Paris last month.Sophie Hallette is now officially a member of Chanel\u2019s M\u00e9tiers d\u2019Art, a consortium of artisan suppliers that the fashion company either owns or has invested in, including Maison Lesage, embroidery; Maison Michel, millinery; Maison Desrues, button makers; and Barrie, cashmere. Each year, Chanel stages an exhibition of the M\u00e9tiers d\u2019Art\u2019s latest creations; this year, the show was scheduled for Dec. 6 at the H\u00f4tel Ritz in Paris. \u201cWe want to protect these little companies with enormous savoir-faire,\u201d Mr. Pavlovsky explained. \u201cWe want to guarantee they will stay in business and keep doing what they do.\u201dThe birth of Sophie Hallette, and the Caudry lace industry, is a snapshot of the Industrial Revolution at its height. In the early 19th century, the Englishmen John Heathcote and John Leavers invented what became known as the Leavers loom, a complicated machine the size of a tank, with thousands of moving parts.When, in 1816, the British government blocked export of the machines as a protectionist measure, three weavers in Britain\u2019s lace-making capital, Nottingham, smuggled several on boats across the English Channel to France \u2014 no easy feat, given the looms\u2019 great weight and size. The smugglers\u2019 aim was to resettle in Valenciennes, a French town near the Belgian border known for lace. But they got only as far as Caudry, so Caudry became a lace-making town, too.In 1887, the French entrepreneur Eug\u00e8ne Hallette founded a lace company with six Leavers looms in Caudry. After Hallette died in 1909, his widow took over operations of what had become one of France\u2019s largest lace-making operations. At the time, there were hundreds of lace manufacturers in Caudry, with men running the machines and women mending any flaws by hand \u2014 a tradition that continues today.In 1942, the French businessman Etienne Lescroart bought Hallette from Eug\u00e8ne\u2019s widow \u2014 the Hallettes had no children \u2014 and, after World War II, expanded into fashion, supplying new couture houses such as Christian Dior and Balmain. Marilyn Monroe regularly wore dresses made of Hallette lace and Jacqueline Kennedy often donned Hallette lace mantillas for Sunday Mass, giving the industry a terrific lift. Along the way, Sophie \u2014 the name of Etienne\u2019s niece \u2014 was added to the company name.When feminism came to the fore in the 1970s and the languid minimalism of Diane Von Furstenberg wrap dresses and Halston jersey columns dominated fashion, Caudry lace manufacturers fell on hard times, and several companies closed. Mr. Lescroart\u2019s son, Bruno, who was then working at Sophie Hallette, wanted to shutter it and get into the restaurant business. \u201cNever!\u201d his father declared.Rightly so. The luxury boom of the late 1990s and early 2000s revived the demand for lace. Then came the royal wedding dress, with a Sophie Hallette lace bodice, in April 2011. The lace, originally designed in 1958 and known for decades simply as Pattern 953070, had long been a favorite of Alexander McQueen\u2019s, as its design includes all the floral symbols of the countries in Britain.But no one at Sophie Hallette knew that it was being used for Ms. Middleton\u2019s dress until she stepped out of the car in front of Westminster Abbey. It has since been rechristened Kate\u2019s Lace, and photos of Ms. Middleton in the gown are proudly displayed throughout the company\u2019s offices and ateliers.The Chanel deal came together by chance: The fashion house was considering purchasing a bankrupt Calais lace company called Codentel, which has long been a supplier for Er\u00e8s, the Chanel-owned lingerie and swimwear brand. Mr. Lescroart\u2019s grandson, Romain, now chief executive of Sophie Hallette, was looking at it, too, as was a Chinese company that had just purchased another ailing Calais lace maker, Desseilles. Joining forces with Romain Lescroart made the most sense to Chanel: \u201cRomain is the lace expert, and we had the financing,\u201d Mr. Pavlovsky said. \u201cIt was the right thing to do.\u201dToday, Groupe Holesco, a holding company created by Bruno Lescroart about 25 years ago, now includes Sophie Hallette, Codentel and a dye house in Caudry. And Sophie Hallette has about 90 Leavers looms and 40 bobbinet tulle looms and produces about 2,000 laces and tulles each season \u2014 100 new designs, and the rest re-editions, such as La Parfaite, or Perfection, a pretty floral-patterned Chantilly lace that has been a best seller since its introduction in 1962.The company exports to 60 countries and takes in about 26 million euros a year in revenue, or about $27.4 million. It is one of six firms still operating in Caudry and one of two in the world that make the coveted bobbinet tulle; the other is in Switzerland. Each machine produces 40 to 100 yards of lace each day \u2014 5,000 needles simultaneously stitching and knotting each stitch. \u201cWhat we do here is a luxury item,\u201d Romain Lescroart said. \u201cIt\u2019s a niche, but on a global scale.\u201dTraining a loom technician generally takes five years, and each technician oversees only two machines, maintaining and repairing them when needed. \u201cA lacemaker knows his machines by heart and will know simply by the sound if it has a problem,\u201d Maud Lescroart, Romain\u2019s sister and the company\u2019s marketing director, said during a tour of the immense factory floor. \u201cThese machines are like the workers\u2019 babies.\u201dLeavers looms have not been produced since the 1960s, so the company keeps old units on hand for parts. The industry has not left Caudry for a cheaper labor market because, Ms. Lescroart explained, \u201cit is a knowledge handed down from generation to generation, and it takes so long to learn \u2014 you could not afford to move it and start anew.\u201dMr. Pavlovsky confirmed: \u201cNowhere else can you find this number of Leavers in one place.\u201cBut what is most wonderful about this partnership is seeing how artisan craftsmanship can be merged with today\u2019s technologies \u2014 that these machines, for example, are a century old but run with computer programs,\u201d he continued. \u201cDeals like this nourish the progress of product development. We are constructing something not only for today but also for tomorrow.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Could \u2018Repeal and Delay\u2019 of Obamacare Affect the Birthrate?", "Date": "2016-12-26", "News": "Supported byThe New Health Care Republicans in Congress will soon be able to repeal Obamacare, as they have long wished to do. The Upshot\u2019s health care columnists, Aaron E. Carroll and Austin Frakt, discuss the possibilities \u2014 the practical and the political. To some people, that might sound like a prudent course of action: to delay major changes so there is time to provide another way for people who rely on Obamacare to get health insurance.But such a delay is also necessary, because congressional Republicans have not yet coalesced around a replacement plan. That\u2019s not a big surprise because, until now, there was never a reasonable prospect of repeal, so getting specific about replace wasn\u2019t necessary. Also, developing a coherent replacement plan involves challenging policy trade-offs and political risks. It will take considerable time for it to come together.Delaying any changes until 2019 or later means that no changes will go into effect until after the 2018 House and Senate elections. No one will yet feel the pain of having to change insurance or providers. Republicans can go into their campaigns claiming to their base that they met their promises to repeal Obamacare without actually having to deal with any repercussions. They could also theoretically claim a mandate for continued change if they retained power.This isn\u2019t too much different than how the Democrats delayed the implementation of much of the A.C.A. until after the 2012 presidential election. Of course, that didn\u2019t protect them from the backlash they felt in 2010. It\u2019s not clear that delaying would completely shield Republicans either. There are other potential downsides from this plan.Insurance companies considering offering marketplace plans might wonder if the investment in the market is worth it. If the A.C.A. will go away \u2014 and with any replacement uncertain \u2014 perhaps they\u2019ll decide to wait and see. Likewise, insurers already offering plans might decide not to continue to do so since it\u2019s not so clear there\u2019s a future in it.Hospitals will worry about whether they\u2019ll see an increase in uninsured patients who are unable to pay for their care. That would certainly happen under repeal and is likely to happen under the types of replace plans Republicans are considering, which cover fewer people. Additionally, if some markets are left without plans because all insurers withdraw, hospitals will also experience greater demand for uncompensated care.Drug and device companies will also worry about potential loss of revenue if fewer people are covered in the future and, therefore, cut back on care and prescriptions.Finally, states that have expanded Medicaid might retrench, worried they\u2019ll be left with the full costs of expansion once repeal goes into effect. And, states that haven\u2019t expanded are more likely to hold off. Again, why invest in a program that\u2019s going away?None of this is good for patients and consumers who just want affordable coverage and accessible care. Are there other downsides I\u2019ve not mentioned?I think we could even get into a situation where people are delaying life decisions until this is resolved. Some women on an A.C.A. plan might put off getting pregnant as long as there\u2019s a chance that they could lose their insurance and not be able to get on a new plan because pregnancy is now a \u201cpreviously existing condition.\u201d I don\u2019t think it\u2019s crazy to believe that repeal and delay could have a noticeable impact on the birthrate in this country.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Aston Martin Broadens the Brand", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byThe paint inspection bay at the Aston Martin plant in Gaydon, England.\u00a0The legendary carmaker Aston Martin is loved and revered in Britain, famed for providing James Bond with his getaway vehicles, as well as having a colorful company history as packed with twists, turns and near-death escapes as the silver-screen secret agent himself.The road has been far from smooth in the 103 years since the car brand was founded; although it has manufactured a long line of record-breaking racing and sports cars, beloved by celebrities and the world\u2019s superrich alike, Aston Martin has been insolvent seven times since its establishment in 1913.Still, after being mired in the red since 2010, there are signs that the company finally is steering itself toward long-term profitability, helped by a recent 200 million pound ($249.2 million) investment program.Following a 55-year absence, the brand made a glitzy return to the Formula One racing circuit with Red Bull, in a partnership linked to a road car collaboration, the \u00a3205 million AM-RB 001. And in September, weeks after opening a flagship store in the Mayfair neighborhood of London showcasing branded handbags, caps and butter-soft leather jackets, Aston Martin even introduced the AM37, a 37-foot powerboat with a price tag of \u00a31.3 million, as it seeks to shift gears and become a global luxury lifestyle brand.With the wheels now in motion on so many ambitious and high-stakes initiatives (the expansion efforts will increase Aston Martin\u2019s unit output from 4,000 to 7,000 per year), one would expect a sense of pressure and expectation at the Gaydon plant. But the Midlands site, with its futuristic corporate offices, orderly silver-walled single factory floor and glistening moat upon which several parked models appear to float majestically, continues to move at a less-frenetic pace than that of most rivals.Vehicles and their parts are made at a series of work stations, where a team of 800 workers hand-builds the cars. Once work is competed at one station, the bodies gently move to the next station on the line, buffed by a team of human hands and state-of-the-art robotic technology. Most employees, whether the seamstresses stitching at the leather seats or the paint specialists who spend about 50 hours per vehicle on the perfect finish, draw on decades of experience (although there also is a crop of youthful looking employees on the payroll).\u201cThere is a quiet confidence here, quite simply, because we know we have many of the world\u2019s greatest car technicians in the world on site,\u201d Marek Reichman, the brand\u2019s chief creative officer, said. \u201cThey build sports cars like our DB111 with the same level of skill and handicraft as they would a hyper car like our AM RB 001. One takes 215 hours, the other 2,000 man-hours, but fundamentally they are very similar processes \u2014 one just takes longer than the other, but they all happen in the same place.\u201dAston Martin has made 80,000 cars in its history, he said, with 90 percent still on the road; the number that Toyota would make in three days, given the Japanese giant\u2019s annual vehicle output of five million units.\u201cLots of the men and women who work here know that if they turned left down the road, to the Jaguar Land Rover factory, they could earn 20 percent more than they do here,\u201d Mr. Reichman said. \u201cBut instead they turn right. And they do that because they love our product, love our reputation and being part of one of the best British auto engineering legacies in history.\u201dAston Martin is the last British carmaker not owned by one of the powerful global giants of the auto industry. Volkswagen bought Bentley in 1998; BMW owns Rolls-Royce Motor Cars and Mini.Ford bought a majority stake in Aston Martin in 1987 but sold it in 2007 to a consortium, including Kuwaiti investors. In 2013, Investindustrial \u2014 an Italian private equity outfit that turned around Ducati before selling it to Audi \u2014 acquired a 37.5 percent holding. And in 2014, Daimler took a 5 percent stake.The plan for the future, both management and investors agree, is to make the brand self-financing, better ensuring its chances of long-term survival despite the waning demand for superluxury sports cars. (It now exports 80 percent of its cars, with its largest markets in the United States, China, the Far East and Middle East.)Still, Mr. Reichman appears convinced of the group\u2019s chances of success.\u201cWhen you buy a sports car today, be it a Ferrari, or a Lamborghini or even an Aston Martin, then you are making a decision about yourself, your fortune and how you want the world to see you,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we are not provocative, we are more acceptable \u2014 at ease with ourselves and a car that people feel comfortable about when they admire.\u201cWe think that the understated beauty the Aston Martin, both inside and out, will resonate more and more in today\u2019s climate. It\u2019s been quite the journey so far. But the best \u2014 we hope \u2014 is ultimately still to come.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France Won\u2019t Seek Re-election", "Date": "2016-12-01", "News": "Supported bySTRASBOURG, France \u2014 Battered by months of dismal approval ratings and a stubbornly high unemployment rate, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France announced Thursday night that he would not compete in next year\u2019s election.The unprecedented decision opened up and energized France\u2019s presidential race even as it added further turmoil to the country\u2019s unsettled politics. It also injected new uncertainty into the political dynamic of Europe as far-right and populist forces are gaining strength across the Continent, as well as in the United States.Mr. Hollande had kept France in suspense for months over whether he would seek another term, turning his choice into a kind of national guessing game.His surprise decision \u2014 he had been expected to run \u2014 was the latest in a series of shocks to French and European politics, which have been upended throughout the year by voter discontent with establishment governance, Mr. Hollande\u2019s included.The announcement \u2014 issued by the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, the seat of the presidency \u2014 was greeted across the political spectrum as a courageous and dignified decision that, as Mr. Hollande himself made clear, was intended to place the interests of the country above his own.\u201cAs a Socialist, because that is my life\u2019s commitment, I cannot accept, I cannot come to terms with the dispersion of the left, with its splitting up,\u201d Mr. Hollande said in a somber statement. \u201cBecause that would remove all hope of winning in the face of conservatism and, worse yet, of extremism.\u201dSo low had his ratings fallen \u2014 Mr. Hollande plumbed historic depths in some surveys, going as low as 4 percent \u2014 that many of his own Socialist colleagues had warned publicly that he was headed for certain defeat if he chose to run.More than that, hanging on to the mantle of standard-bearer for the Socialists threatened to bring the party down with him, rendering it all but irrelevant in elections next spring.That prospect had split his own political grouping wide open. He was even forced to submit to a humiliating primary election \u2014 also without precedent \u2014 to decide who would be the party\u2019s candidate. Several of his former cabinet ministers had already announced they would run against him.Now, with Mr. Hollande out, the Socialists are thought to have improved their chances, even if only slightly. His law-and-order prime minister, Manuel Valls, is likely to step up as a leading contender in the primary.Mr. Valls is associated with a kind of toughness that analysts and citizens found lacking in Mr. Hollande, and that could help him compete in the general election against candidates from the right.At the same time, Mr. Valls could be tainted by his association with Mr. Hollande\u2019s administration, which has been a study in the slow slipping away of authority.For years an unremarkable Socialist functionary who rose slowly through the ranks, waiting for his turn, Mr. Hollande owed his narrow election in 2012 more to disgust with the incumbent, Nicolas Sarkozy, than to any personal appeal he exerted. Still, the French left was delighted that after years in the political wilderness, it finally had an apparent champion in Mr. Hollande.He then dealt himself a final, perhaps fatal, blow by spending hours confiding the inner workings of his presidency to a pair of journalists.Analysts have long pointed to Mr. Hollande\u2019s ideological fuzziness \u2014 dangerous for a politician faced with a French electorate that has historically demanded clarity and authority from its top leader.Months ago, Mr. Hollande suggested that he would not run again if he could not bring it down. He made good on that promise Thursday night.\u201cThe major commitment I made to you was to lower the unemployment rate,\u201d a melancholy Mr. Hollande said on national television from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace on Thursday night. \u201cAnd I devoted to that, with my government, all of my energy, took all of the risks.\u201d\u201cI lowered taxes on companies, because that\u2019s what is needed to create more jobs. I worked to boost hiring, making worker training a top priority,\u201d Mr. Hollande said. \u201cAnd I took the responsibility to reform the labor market. The results are there \u2014 later than I had said that would be, I admit, but they are there.\u201dActually, though, unemployment has not budged significantly during Mr. Hollande\u2019s term.Otherwise, his short speech was a dutiful laundry list of the things he said he had accomplished: legalizing same-sex marriage, the Paris climate accord, help for schools, reorganizing France\u2019s local governments. It all lacked a defining stamp, as Mr. Hollande himself appeared to recognize.There was a sense of relief in the immediate reactions of his Socialist colleagues.\u201cThis was a difficult choice, reflective and serious,\u201d Mr. Valls said.\u201cI want to express to Fran\u00e7ois Hollande my emotion, my respect, my loyalty and my affection,\u201d Mr. Valls added. He did not announce his own candidacy, but he has been suggesting that he might do so soon.The National Front reacted with glee and mockery to Mr. Hollande\u2019s decision, even though it is now likely to face a much tougher Socialist opponent next year.\u201cIt was smart, smart of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande,\u201d said Florian Philippot, a top National Front official. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing for France and the French. It says much about the sense of weariness, the deliquescence, of this term.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to a primary election scheduled for January in France. It is an open primary for the political left, not a Socialist party primary.Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seller-Financed Deals Are Putting Poor People in Lead-Tainted Homes", "Date": "2016-12-26", "News": "Supported byBALTIMORE \u2014 A year after Tiffany Bennett moved into a two-story red brick house at 524 Loudon Avenue here, she received alarming news.Two children, both younger than 6, for whom Ms. Bennett was guardian, were found to have dangerous levels of lead in their blood. Lead paint throughout the nearly 100-year-old home had poisoned them.Who was responsible for the dangerous conditions in the home?Baltimore health officials say it was an out-of-state investment company that entered into a rent-to-own lease with the unemployed Ms. Bennett to take the home in 2014 \u201cas is\u201d \u2014 chipping, peeling lead paint and all.Ms. Bennett, 46, and the children moved out, but they should never have been in the house at all. City officials had declared the house \u201cunfit for human habitation\u201d in 2013.Throughout the country, tens of thousands of rundown homes have been scooped up by investment companies that have offered high-interest financing or rent-to-own deals largely to poor people. Many of these homes were foreclosed on during the housing crisis.These investors, however, often put no money toward renovation, or for fixing lead paint problems. The low-income buyers and renters are forced to make all repairs. When there are serious problems with the homes, victims can be required to sign confidentiality agreements to keep them quiet in a settlement after they have been compensated, as happened in Ms. Bennett\u2019s case.As a result, seller-financed housing contracts have aggravated a persistent problem of lead poisoning among young children in this country.It is not known how many homes nationwide are in seller-financed contracts, and not every state requires that such contracts be recorded. Still, health officials say they are increasingly seeing a connection between homes that are in seller-financed contracts and lead-poisoning cases.\u201cUnfortunately they have this contract which removes the actual owner of the home from the liabilities of fixing the home and requires these people who have no money to fix their own home,\u201d said Dr. Jennifer Lowry, chief of toxicology in the pediatrics unit of Children\u2019s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City.Dr. Lowry said she had seen an increase in patients with lead poisoning who live in homes bought through a seller-financed contract on both the Missouri and Kansas sides of the city.\u201cWhat I care about is this kid who has elevated blood levels and yet I can\u2019t get anybody to fix the home,\u201d she said.Ms. Bennett entered into a rent-to-own contract with Vision Property Management of Columbia, S.C., one of the biggest players in this fast-growing market.Vision failed to register the property with Baltimore housing officials after buying it in 2014 from Fannie Mae, the government-controlled mortgage finance firm. It then ignored the city\u2019s previous building code violation, according to public records reviewed by The New York Times.The details of Ms. Bennett\u2019s situation were pieced together through interviews with public officials, court records and documents provided through public records requests to various city and state agencies. Some of the documents were redacted to protect the privacy of the children.In many cases, families who had been affected by lead poisoning declined to comment when reached, citing concerns about reprisals.Baltimore has fined Vision more than $11,300 for failing to register 43 homes in the city, a requirement that applies to all landlords. State lead investigators visited at least two other Vision homes earlier this year but could not physically enter and inspect them.A representative for Vision said that the company \u201cdoes not comment on the specific details of matters pertaining to tenants or properties\u201d and that noted the matter with Ms. Bennett had been resolved.When it came to fixing the lead issues in Ms. Bennett\u2019s home, Vision did not respond to the city\u2019s request in late 2015. The company has argued its contracts put all responsibility for repairs on its tenants.In most cities and states, landlords are required to keep the properties they rent in habitable condition. Some legal experts say seller-financed contracts like those used by Vision may violate that requirement and could be unenforceable in housing court.Baltimore, as a matter of law, requires landlords to ensure that a home is fit for human habitation, and building officials said that includes rent-to-own landlords. But homes that are leased in rent-to-own deals can fall through the cracks because the city has so many abandoned and rundown homes.Jason Hessler, deputy assistant commissioner for Baltimore Housing, said, \u201cThe house was in violation at the time it was sold by Fannie Mae to Vision and was supposed to be unoccupied until approved by the building department.\u201d But he added that unless it was obvious that someone had moved into a house without the department\u2019s permission, building inspectors might not know.For many poor families who want to own a house and cannot get a mortgage, nontraditional housing transactions like Ms. Bennett\u2019s have become their only option. Some do not understand what they are signing.Dr. Lowry says that many of the families she works with do not speak English and thought they were buying a house outright. She was one of several housing officials and doctors who discussed the problems caused by seller-financed deals at a recent conference on childhood lead poisoning in Washington.Seller-financed deals, which include contracts for deed and rent-to-own leases, are loaded with risk. They lack basic consumer protections, and residents can be easily evicted since the title to a home is not transferred until the final payment is made.Poor families that buy or rent one of these rundown homes often find themselves with another problem: Because they do not technically own their house, they are ineligible for any state or local grants to help defray the cost of removing lead paint.Kendra Harrell, 23, moved into a Vision home in Baltimore with her mother in 2014 on a rent-to-own contract. Ms. Harrell, who has two young children, estimated that she had paid more than $1,000 to repair the home, which still has a leaking roof.\u201cPretty much everything is on me,\u201d said Ms. Harrell, who works as a cashier at a local Home Depot.Now she worries about the chipping paint on the banister in the home, which was built in 1915, adding that her son had tested positive for lead while living in another house. \u201cI figured maybe I could try to get someone out to break off the paint and paint over it,\u201d she added.In New York State, some grants provided to residents in rural communities to eliminate \u201ccritical health and safety threats\u201d from homes, including lead paint, specifically exclude anyone buying a home with a contract for deed.A lead-safe program in Columbus, Ohio, is open only to property owners \u2014 again shutting out people buying homes through a contract for deed or a signing a rent-to-own lease.Katarina Karac, an assistant city attorney for Columbus, recently helped one woman who bought a home with a contract for deed get the seller to apply for a lead paint removal grant. Ms. Karac said the woman, who has three young children, had applied at least twice to the lead-safe program and was rejected because she did not legally own the home.\u201cShe was lucky enough the property owner was willing to work with her,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine someone in her position ordering a lead test, and if lead is found, asserting a claim against the owner.\u201dIn Michigan last month, a special lead-poisoning task force set up by the governor after the water crisis in Flint recommended a one-time lead inspection, the results of which property owners must disclose to buyers and renters. The proposal stipulated that the requirement could not be \u201cwaived in the event of a sale through land contract.\u201dIn Ms. Bennett\u2019s case, Baltimore\u2019s health department sued a limited liability company tied to Vision in December 2015 for failing to promptly comply with an order to eliminate the lead paint condition in the home.Many of Vision\u2019s homes were bought cheaply from Fannie Mae and had been empty for years. Vision bought the house at 524 Loudon Avenue from Fannie for about $5,000.Ms. Bennett, who paid a monthly rent of $440, sued Vision after learning the children were poisoned by lead. She declined to talk about her situation, citing a confidentiality provision in the settlement of her lawsuit. She left the house in November 2015 as part of a settlement with Vision.Lead poisoning has been particularly acute in Baltimore because of its aging housing stock. The city has about 40,000 abandoned homes; on some streets the vacant, rundown homes outnumber the occupied ones.Maryland\u2019s environmental agency says some 1,100 children age 6 or younger tested positive for elevated lead levels in the city of Baltimore in 2015.\u201cThis is something that everyone has an obligation to fix \u2014 certainly the landlord has an obligation as well,\u201d said Dr. Leana Wen, Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner.And the company has violated rules in other cities.In 2012, legal aid lawyers in Minnesota sued Vision on behalf of a couple with four children and two grandchildren, contending the company knowingly sold them, through a contract for deed, a home in Minneapolis that the city determined had a \u201csevere\u201d lead paint problem. Conditions in the home, which Vision bought from Fannie Mae, were so bad that the city posted a \u201cdo not occupy\u201d warning notice on the house.But the couple, Charles and Leona Rush, claimed they did not see any warning sign when they bought the house. In court papers, Vision disputed the Rushes\u2019 claim. The company\u2019s lawyers argued that \u201cunless plaintiffs closed their eyes as they entered the property, they saw the bright green lead hazard sign.\u201dThe lawsuit ended with a confidential settlement.Ruth Ann Norton, who heads the Green & Healthy Homes Initiative, a Baltimore-based nonprofit that promotes national policies to combat childhood lead poisoning, says the federal government can do more to make sure homes with lead paint problems are not dumped onto the market. Fannie Mae sold some 900,000 foreclosed homes after the crisis.Peter Bakel, a Fannie spokesman, said, \u201cFannie Mae has policies in place designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws regarding lead paint disclosures and remediation.\u201dMs. Norton\u2019s group is proposing that government housing agencies be required to eliminate dangerous lead conditions in vacant and foreclosed homes before putting them on the market.\u201cWe should not allow houses to go on the market that will poison children,\u201d said Ms. Norton, whose organization provided assistance to Ms. Bennett.Vision has since washed its hands of the Loudon Avenue home. The company settled with Baltimore health officials by paying a $10,000 fine in October and sold the house last summer.The house is being renovated, but a sign posted in the dirt yard advertised the house as \u201cFOR RENT!!!\u201dSusan C.

{"Headline": "A Celebration of American Innovation, From the Erie Canal to Jazz to the MRI", "Date": "2016-12-30", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Kevin Baker offers a collection of easy, fast-to-read vignettes illustrating the inventiveness of the American people, mainly from the Industrial Revolution to today. In a now popular genre established by Neil MacGregor\u2019s \u201cA History of the World in 100 Objects,\u201d he focuses on 76 innovations or creations, ranging from the Erie Canal to jazz, from the transcontinental railroad to the microprocessor. Each selection gets about 1,000-1,500 words and, in feature journalism style, provides a what, who, when, why and how of the innovation and its impact. Accompanied by sidebar factoids and cartoonish line drawings, the book seems aimed at young adults, serving up interesting bits of history in a Wiki-lite fashion.The accounts are straightforward and informative without much in-depth context or treatment of historical or biographical nuance \u2014 and there\u2019s no mistaking this for a scholarly treatment. Why 76 cases of ingenuity? No real reason. And why these? Pretty arbitrary. The selections are broken up into categories \u2014 roaming, building, curing, playing and so on \u2014 which is fair enough. But one wonders about the absence of some key categories of American creativity \u2014 like electing, financing, protesting, educating, conserving, cooking and loving.The categories thus composed obviate the need for a chronological progression, but even thematically, the narrative connection between one selection and another is unclear. Within categories there are puzzling omissions. History ends too soon in \u201cFighting\u201d \u2014 there are no F-15s or drones. With regard to \u201cPowering,\u201d i.e., energy, nuclear is absent. \u201cProducing,\u201d i.e., agriculture, ends curiously, or perhaps ironically, with channeling irrigation from farmland to meeting the needs of a growing Los Angeles. There\u2019s a curious category \u2014 \u201cWomen Inventors\u201d \u2014 with only two selections, but women\u2019s contributions edge in at a few other points \u2014 perhaps expectedly with the bra, dishwasher and diapers, but also informatively with Kevlar and the Laserphaco probe. Equal rights might also have made a good choice. As a native New Yorker I was personally O.K. with the bias toward that city \u2014 but objectively the inclusion of the Polo Grounds, Penn Station, the subway, Coney Island, and the Hudson and East River tunnels seems a bit too parochial.What explains the American penchant for creativity, invention and innovation? Baker asserts it\u2019s because the United States is the original and exemplary nation of modernity \u2014 founded and energized by the very idea of ingenuity. As the book\u2019s subtitle suggests, ingenuity is somehow baked into American individualism, national character and social life. Baker sums up the causes of America\u2019s ingenuity in familiar fashion, almost canonical among innovation stump speakers. American ingenuity thrives on the freedom to explore and create, the pursuit of equality of opportunity, the appreciation of teamwork, the orientation to foster public involvement \u2014 inviting investors and serving consumers \u2014 as well as government encouragement, leadership and patent regulation.This particular set of qualities has long been part of American self-consciousness, noted especially by de Tocqueville in his insightful study of our \u201ccan\u202fdo\u201d society. Establishing correlations, causality and logical interpretation for why innovation occurs has occupied much social science theory and research \u2014 to mixed results. Sometimes invention emerges from quirky, stubborn isolation and greed, and unfortunately sometimes from repressive, authoritarian and totalitarian regimes. If America has proved particularly fertile for ingenuity, though, the reasons won\u2019t be found in this pleasant but superficial book.Richard Kurin is the Smithsonian\u2019s acting provost and under secretary, as well as the author of \u201cThe Smithsonian\u2019s History of America in 101 Objects.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Israel, a Medical Marijuana Pioneer, Is Eager to Capitalize", "Date": "2016-12-17", "News": "Supported byJERUSALEM \u2014 Israeli scientists began their pioneering research to isolate the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana with a 10-pound stash seized by the Tel Aviv police. That effort, in the 1960s, helped propel Israel to the vanguard of research into the plant\u2019s medicinal properties and lay the foundations for a medical marijuana industry.Now the nation\u2019s burgeoning pot business, backed by an unlikely coalition of farmers, lawyers, scientists, entrepreneurs and the country\u2019s ultra-Orthodox health minister, is going mainstream \u2014 and eyeing markets abroad.Marijuana, or cannabis, is still classified as a dangerous drug in Israel and remains illegal for recreational purposes. But the government is also at the forefront of efforts to develop and expand the fast-growing medical marijuana industry and make Israel a major center for it.Recent government efforts to regulate medical marijuana will make it more accessible and available by prescription at pharmacies. The government has also appointed a committee to examine the possibility of Israel becoming one of the few countries to allow exports, although the destination for products remains unclear.\u201cIt is almost unprecedented,\u201d said Tamir Gedo, the chief executive of Breath of Life Pharma, an Israeli company permitted to grow medical cannabis and make and distribute products. \u201cIt seems the government is working faster than the private industry.\u201dThe reforms spearheaded by the Health Ministry, which is led by Yaakov Litzman of the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism Party, open up licensing for an unlimited number of growers, up from eight farms. The list of doctors trained and authorized to prescribe marijuana is to be expanded and research encouraged. The reforms, which were approved by the government in the summer, were formulated in cooperation with the Ministries of Agriculture, Justice, Internal Security and Finance.\u201cI cannot say that I am in favor of cannabis,\u201d Mr. Litzman said at a business conference last month, reflecting concerns that medical marijuana could trickle into the recreational market. But Mr. Litzman said he would even support the idea of export so long as revenues went to the Health Ministry, adding, \u201cThere is a lot of pressure on me.\u201dSome of Israel\u2019s more traditional medical institutions and associations are still averse to joining the party, a wariness that marijuana advocates put down to a lack of knowledge. The police worry about leakage into the recreational black market, and some Israelis are concerned that export, if allowed, would stigmatize the country as one that dealt primarily in arms and drugs.About 25,000 Israelis, in a population of 8.5 million, hold permits to use medical marijuana to ease symptoms of cancer, epilepsy and other diseases, but that number is expected to grow rapidly. So far, medical marijuana has been distributed by the growers through special dispensaries or by home delivery.The Health Ministry\u2019s written protocols on the matter, known as the Green Book, have generated international interest.The ministry has approved dozens of clinical trials, Dr. Dor said, adding, \u201cIf we don\u2019t do it right here, the specialists will go abroad with their knowledge, and we have wonderful knowledge here.\u201dRaphael Mechoulam, now a professor of medicinal chemistry at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and his colleague Yechiel Gaoni first isolated the main compounds, including the psychoactive ingredient \u2014 tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC \u2014 with the marijuana supplied by the Tel Aviv police. When administrators at the Weizmann Institute of Science, where Professor Mechoulam was conducting his research, first called the police with the request, he recalled in an interview, \u201cthey asked if I was trustworthy.\u201dProfessor Mechoulam, 86, has continued his research in his current post, focusing on the compounds in the brain that make the active components of marijuana work. He is also a consultant for the Ministry of Health and collaborates with research groups around the world.\u201cMedicinal cannabis has to follow medical lines of thought and development and modern medical routes\u201d in order to produce proper drugs, he said. Pointing to an international paucity of clinical trials, he said, \u201cIsrael has more than the United States at the moment, which is ridiculous.\u201d In the United States, medical marijuana programs exist in many states but remain illegal under federal law.Professor Mechoulam is also a member of the advisory board of Breath of Life, whose products, according to Mr. Gedo, the chief executive, are made according to pharmaceutical best-practice protocols.\u201cWe are working as a pharmaceutical company, not a cannabis company,\u201d Mr. Gedo said. Breath of Life is participating in a dozen clinical trials, including one based on cannabinoids, the chemical compounds in marijuana, for autism in children with the Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem.According to Mr. Gedo, several American companies are conducting trials in Israel based on Breath of Life\u2019s active pharmaceutical ingredients.Teva Israel, a subsidiary of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., recently announced a distribution and cooperation agreement with Syqe Medical, a Tel Aviv company that developed an inhaler for administering marijuana in precise doses. The dose can be tailored to each patient like a standard medical treatment, which experts say should reduce or eliminate the objections of reluctant physicians.Two international medical marijuana conferences have taken place in Israel this year. At the Cann10 conference in Tel Aviv in September, speakers discussed science, medicine, technology and commerce. Purveyors, some in white lab coats, displayed their wares. A grower called PharmoCann displayed rows of sealed plastic vials containing strains of flowers undergoing testing with names like Blue, Train Wreck and Voodoo Child.\u201cWe hope the market will open up in the world as soon as possible,\u201d Moshe Ihea, Cannabliss\u2019s founder and chief executive, said. \u201cFirst we have to open up the people.\u201d He added that he had discovered the medicinal benefits after he suffered a leg injury during an army exercise.Saul Kaye, a pharmacist and the chief executive of iCan: Israel-Cannabis, a venture fund and technology incubator for start-ups driving the global medical marijuana industry, said this \u201ccould be another incredible economy for Israel.\u201dHe added, \u201cThere\u2019s a national consciousness for cannabis that you cannot ignore.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Her general is at once the supreme leader (in keeping with a recent trend in Hollywood movies to depict women as every bit as tough as men) and strikingly demure when not in battle (something the filmmakers felt made her more viable to Eastern audiences).Trying to appeal to everyone often warps the result.

I saw it on the internet but now, live, it looks very \u2014 cheap.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s quite sad, really,\u201d said Michaela van den Berg, a visitor from England whose husband, Jos, compared the tree to a matchstick. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a joke.\u201dA classic specimen, the tree is not. Its trunk is crooked, for one thing. And its other shortcomings are painfully obvious to passers-by. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have a top. It looks like it\u2019s missing branches; it\u2019s kind of skinny-looking,\u201d Pierre Bourcier said after snapping a photo with his phone.And then there are the ornaments: The tree is covered with red plastic inverted triangles topped by green maple leaves, the logo of the Canadian Tire retail chain, which supplied its white lights. A small child standing at the base of the tree this week stumped her father by asking why it \u201clooked like a store.\u201dHow did a holiday celebration became a municipal punch line? Chalk it up to (perhaps too much) ambition, inadequate financing and Murphy\u2019s law.\u201cWe have good intentions,\u201d said Jean-David Pelletier, one of the principals of Sapin MTL, the company that came up with the idea of rivaling New York\u2019s tree. \u201cBut the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and we had problems.\u201dSapin MTL is in the business of home-delivering normal-size Christmas trees, and it proposed the big one as a promotional gimmick. Mr. Pelletier said the company had a more majestic, shapely tree in mind. It researched the typical height for recent Rockefeller Center trees \u2014 74 to 76 feet \u2014 and found a 78-footer in Ontario that Mr. Pelletier described as \u201camazing.\u201dBut its narrow height advantage vanished in early November when Rockefeller Center announced that its 2016 tree would be a 94-foot Norway spruce.Mr. Pelletier and his partners then had less than a month to come up with a new, taller rival, and they appealed to the public, which suggested about 100 candidates. The balsam fir they chose came from the Eastern Townships of Quebec, near the border with the United States.\u201cIt\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s authentic and it\u2019s a real tree that you find in the forests of Quebec,\u201d Mr. Pelletier said. \u201cWe\u2019re not pretending this is the most amazing, beautiful tree in the world.\u201dFacing a Nov. 30 deadline for unveiling the tree, the Sapin crew had to hurry. The tree was harvested, placed on a special flatbed truck and brought to Montreal under police escort within 72 hours. But a tight schedule and a tight budget meant that some corners were cut \u2014 and so was the tree.Somehow, the tree that reached the closed-off section of St. Catherine Street where the market is held measured just 88 feet tall, six feet short of the one in Rockefeller Center. Mr. Pelletier\u2019s brother Philippe, another principal in the company, said a bit sheepishly on Friday that they had simply settled for the tallest tree they could find in time.And there was no time or money to give it the extensive arboreal spa treatment that the New York tree gets; all the workers could do was reattach, sometimes rather obviously, a few of the larger branches that had broken off in shipping.As for the decorations, Jean-David Pelletier said his company\u2019s responsibility ended once the tree was in its bare steel stand on St. Catherine Street.Jane Shaw, a spokeswoman for Canadian Tire, said the company had not required the logo ornaments in exchange for donating the lights. She called them \u201ca gesture from the organizers\u201d of the Christmas market.The skinny, misshapen and widely unloved tree does attract some expressions of appreciation. Many seem to be of the ironic variety often reserved for no-budget horror movies. But some seem sincere.As a reporter was interviewing Mr. Pelletier in the market, a woman interrupted to say the tree was \u201cbeautiful,\u201d before swiftly walking away.This year\u2019s debacle hasn\u2019t deterred Mr. Pelletier. He said his company was determined to make sure that Montreal truly outdoes New York next year, now that his fellow citizens have had their fun at this year\u2019s tree\u2019s expense.\u201cI think we can celebrate the Christmas magic and stop saying it\u2019s ugly, ugly, ugly,\u201d he said, as a family posed for a photo in front of the tree. \u201cNow in Quebec, there\u2019s Cirque du Soleil, Celine Dion and the naughty fir \u2014 we prefer that to \u2018ugly.\u2019 \u2018Naughty\u2019 is better.\u201dGesturing up at the tree, he said: \u201cLook at him. You\u2019ll find something sympatique in him.\u201d So would Charlie Brown.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Weighs Protections for Immigrants Threatened by Trump Policies", "Date": "2016-12-04", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Top Democratic lawmakers in California are moving to enact sweeping legislation to protect undocumented immigrants from deportation, the first sign of what they say will be an effort to resist immigration policies championed by President-elect Donald J. Trump.The measures, which will be introduced Monday, would provide free legal help to undocumented immigrants during deportation proceedings, offer more assistance in criminal court, and further limit local law enforcement\u2019s cooperation with federal immigration agents. The measures contrast sharply with the kind of policies that Mr. Trump pressed on the campaign trail.\u201cThroughout the presidential campaign and since, the president-elect has made many troubling statements that run counter to the principles that define California today,\u201d said Kevin de Le\u00f3n, the Senate president pro tempore, who is backing the package. \u201cThere is no greater policy area than immigration where the comments run headlong to the values we share as Californians.\u201dThe legislation suggests the level of opposition Mr. Trump may face in California, a state where 40 percent of the population is Latino. The leaders of both chambers of the Legislature are Latino, as is the state\u2019s attorney general-designee, Xavier Becerra. Mr. de Le\u00f3n said that pushing immigration measures would be a priority of the Legislature.The bills are likely to pass, as both the chambers of California\u2019s Legislature, as well as the governor\u2019s office, are controlled by Democrats. The measures are the latest in a long line of immigrant-friendly policies passed by the Legislature, whose members include a number of immigrants and the children of immigrants. The state already offers in-state college tuition rates and driver\u2019s licenses for undocumented immigrants.About two-thirds of all detained immigrants in California do not have lawyers, and several studies have shown that immigrants with a lawyer are far more likely to succeed in challenging their deportation.Another proposal would set up facilities throughout the state to train public defenders in immigration law. The public defenders would be better able to help immigrants understand what impact their criminal offenses might have on their deportation case, Mr. de Le\u00f3n said.Mr. Trump has said he will focus on deporting criminals, but has also said he intends to immediately deport two million to three million immigrants. About 820,000 undocumented immigrants have been convicted of crimes, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research group.\u201cIf the president-elect has identified two to three million criminal immigrants, we can only assume it\u2019s a pretense to open up criteria to deport mothers who are pulled over for a broken taillight,\u201d Mr. de Le\u00f3n said. \u201cWe want to ensure that those facing deportation are afforded due process, so that the most vulnerable are protected.\u201dA 2014 state law prohibits local jails from holding immigrants any longer than required by criminal law, with exceptions for violent and other serious crimes. Most counties in California also prohibit holding immigrants beyond their sentence unless federal immigration agents have a judicial order. The new law would go even further and prohibit all state and local law enforcement agencies from responding to requests from immigration authorities.\u201cThe state is taking concrete steps to protect its residents, including by making sure its resources and personnel are not being used to deport its residents,\u201d said Jessica Karp Bansal, the litigation director for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, which has advocated these policies. \u201cThese are broad first steps to address the threats that are already out there.\u201dMr. de Le\u00f3n said the bills would be voted on next month. They will require a two-thirds majority to be enacted.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Rising Prices in Oakland Push Artists Into Risky Housing", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byOAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 San Francisco is full of big dreams. Oakland is where people make them work.The city of about 400,000 sits on the east side of San Francisco Bay and historically has served as a low-priced alternative to its more famous neighbor, a place where service workers could buy a home, young professionals could get an extra bedroom and artists lived in low-rent warehouses while sleeping beside their next installation.But over the past few years, as prices have surged across the Bay Area, Oakland\u2019s pricing advantages have mostly eroded. Rents have increased 70 percent in five years, more than in any other big city in the nation, according to Zillow, the online real estate pricing service. The city\u2019s $2,899 median rent is now among the highest, and just short of median rents in Manhattan.The conditions that led to the fire that killed at least 36 people on Friday night was a result of a dangerous mix of factors in which dozens of partygoers were invited to a warehouse that was dark, congested and mazelike, with flammable art and a jerry-built electrical system.The victims died because they were trapped in a tinderbox. Yet the economic backdrop of the tragedy is also important because it shows how rising rents and fears of eviction can push vulnerable people in a desperate search for housing to unsafe spaces.Oakland\u2019s housing prices have always fluctuated with Bay Area booms and busts, and complaints about gentrification were part of the 1990s dot-com boom here as well. The effects are more pronounced this time around because as tech companies have migrated closer to San Francisco from places like Palo Alto and Mountain View, Oakland has been pulled deeper into Silicon Valley\u2019s orbit. Uber, the ride-hailing service now valued at almost $70 billion, plans to open an office in downtown Oakland in the next year or so.This crisis isn\u2019t limited to the Bay Area. Across the country, and especially in expensive cities like New York and Seattle, urban areas have been flooded with high-paid tech and finance workers who have pushed up rents. Blue-collar workers and families have been displaced to cheaper housing on the fringe, but many creative types have made do by finding alternative living arrangements like industrial property, recreational vehicles and even boats.In Oakland, where for decades warehouses have served as a haven for artists, this often means living at the whims of any landlord willing to look the other way.\u201cThere\u2019s a kind of unholy alliance in which these buildings are leased with a \u2018nod nod, wink wink, nobody lives there,\u2019 \u201d said Thomas Dolan, an Oakland architect who specializes in live/work spaces and helps building owners convert illegally occupied warehouses into legally occupied lofts. \u201cIt\u2019s a precarious situation where tenants exchange cheap rent for substandard housing \u2014 and if they rock the boat, they\u2019re out.\u201dIn the aftermath of the fire, artists\u2019 grief over lost friends quickly turned to anxiety that a crackdown could lead to widespread eviction from one of the Bay Area\u2019s few remaining sources of affordable housing.\u201cThe longer-term fear is, \u2018Does this mean the end of these spaces in the Bay Area and with it the last vestige of any kind of affordable artists community?\u2019\u201d said Aaron Muszalski, an artist who has spent the past two decades living and working in warehouses across the region.Unlike San Francisco, whose once-gritty waterfront has been transformed into a high-end neighborhood where the San Francisco Giants play next to multimillion-dollar condominiums, Oakland can still lay claim to the Bay Area\u2019s industrial past. There are bars still frequented by dockworkers, and hipsters wear T-shirts emblazoned with the hulking white cranes that line the Port of Oakland.Many of the city\u2019s industrial warehouses originally served as a waypoint where shippers stored cargo. But as international commerce was accelerated by \u201ccontainerization\u201d \u2014 the process by which rectangular crates full of products like California wine and Chinese electronics can be loaded by cranes between boats and trucks \u2014 warehouses went empty and artists moved in.The result has been a vast gray economy of live/work spaces that, legal or not, are regarded as an important source of affordable housing and part of what makes Oakland, Oakland.\u201cThere have been efforts to legalize Oakland\u2019s live/work spaces for years,\u201d said Joshua Simon, executive director the East Bay Asian Local Development Corporation, a nonprofit that helps develop affordable housing. \u201cToday it\u2019s critical that we find ways to use every housing option that\u2019s safe \u2014 the worst thing we could do would be to overreact and eliminate this type of housing as an option.\u201dThe catch, however, is that once a loft becomes legal the rent becomes unaffordable. So while living in an illegal space may require things like coping with a makeshift kitchen with a sink that drains into a bucket, it\u2019s better than living nowhere.\u201cYou bring these places up to code and you end up pricing out the people who make Oakland such a great place,\u201d Mr. Dolan said.Cheap rent is not the only draw. Several current and former warehouse residents described being absorbed into a broad community centered on building and making noise, whether it\u2019s daytime hammering and welding, or throbbing nighttime parties whose locations are secret.Part of the bonding experience is in maintaining the charade that nobody lives there.There are rituals like renting U-Haul trucks to store mattresses on days when the building owner sends an insurance inspector over. If the fire department knocks, you ignore it.Before he became the owner of the Starline Social Club, an Oakland bar and music space, Adam Hatch, 38, was part of an illegal live/work art gallery called Lobot. He remains connected with the scene, and on Monday night his bar was full of A\u2019s hats, Raiders jackets and tears as patrons observed a moment of silence for a victim who painted nails there on Monday nights.\u201cSometimes it\u2019s just sort of magical to be in a place you\u2019re not supposed to be,\u201d Mr. Hatch said of the warehouse scene.But there is also a risk, as the fire at the warehouse, known as the Ghost Ship, showed. Most of the power accrues to the so-called master tenant \u2014 the person whose name is on the lease.The people who lived at Ghost Ship in the months preceding the fire painted varying pictures of that dynamic.Shelley Mack, 58, moved into one of several mobile homes housed inside the warehouse in October 2014, paying $700 a month. Soon, she said, the building\u2019s head tenant, Derick Ion Almena, was asking her for another $700, this time for upkeep. She said he cut off electricity for people who disagreed with him and blocked an upstairs exit.Others, however, said they were just happy to have a place to live. Josh Hershberger, 31, a tattoo artist and muralist, had been homeless before he found the warehouse. Mr. Almena let him pay rent by the day \u2014 $10 or $20 \u2014 and provided him with a community. \u201cThis was my home. It was a foundation.\u201dWithout the Ghost Ship, he said, he would have been on the street.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mexico\u2019s Central Bank Chief to Take International Post", "Date": "2016-12-01", "News": "Supported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 The governor of Mexico\u2019s central bank, Agust\u00edn Carstens, said on Thursday that he would leave his position next July, adding to the uncertainty that has rattled the country\u2019s economy since the election of Donald J. Trump.Mr. Carstens, 58, a well-regarded economist, will leave the Bank of Mexico, where he has been governor for seven years, to lead the Bank for International Settlements, a financial institution based in Basel, Switzerland, that acts as a bank for central banks.It is a complex time for Mexico, as worry mounts that Mr. Trump as the United States president will make good on his campaign promises to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and deport Mexican migrants, anxiety that has pushed the value of the peso down to record levels.As news of Mr. Carstens\u2019s departure broke on Thursday morning, the peso slipped further, but he sought to provide some reassurance.\u201cI am still going to be here for seven more months and I hope the storm doesn\u2019t last that long,\u201d he told a news conference. His departure raises the question of who President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto will nominate as his successor to finish out the term, which ends in 2021. The president\u2019s choice requires Senate ratification.Mr. Carstens has called Mr. Trump \u201ca hurricane\u201d for the Mexican economy. The central bank raised interest rates two weeks ago and cut its growth forecast. The central bank governor said then that understanding the policies of the incoming administration in Washington was \u201clike trying to put a jigsaw puzzle together without having all the pieces.\u201dMexico is particularly vulnerable to Mr. Trump\u2019s antitrade message because its dynamic export sector is the economy\u2019s main driver. Mexico sends some 80 percent of its exports to the United States and investors fear that any disruption to North American trade would hit Mexico disproportionately.\u201cThe timing of the decision is far from ideal,\u201d wrote Daniel Kerner and Carlos Petersen at the Eurasia Group, a risk analysis and consulting group. \u201cInvestors and politicians saw Carstens as a bulwark of macroeconomic responsibility and independence who could help navigate these troubled waters, at a time when the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to begin raising rates and Trump\u2019s policies could begin to further harm Mexico\u2019s economy.\u201dAlthough Mr. Carstens tried to play down the effect of his departure, arguing that he was just one member of the central bank\u2019s board, he did acknowledge that \u201cif there is one thing that characterizes the moment we\u2019re living through, it is uncertainty.\u201dDespite a long career at the central bank and Mexico\u2019s finance ministry, Mr. Carstens was known to be considering an international position. In 2011, he unsuccessfully sought the position as managing director of the International Monetary Fund.Although there was speculation that he had a difficult relationship with the finance team of President Pe\u00f1a Nieto, \u201cthe decision seems to have been driven mostly by Carstens\u2019s own professional interests rather than political pressures or disagreements over monetary policy,\u201d the Eurasia Group analysts wrote.Finance Minister Jos\u00e9 Antonio Meade described Mr. Carstens\u2019s selection at the Bank for International Settlements, which promotes international monetary and financial cooperation, as an honor for Mexico.\u201cThere is an additional element that gives us a lot of calm today,\u201d Mr. Meade said. \u201cThe decision is being announced today but it won\u2019t be implemented until near the end of next year.\u201dMr. Carstens\u2019s departure presents a dilemma for the president. \u201cNow President Pe\u00f1a Nieto faces a momentous decision to propose a solid candidate with credibility, even more so when there is no natural successor,\u201d wrote analysts at Citibanamex.Advertisement"}

More like, let\u2019s wait until Mr. Trump is actually sworn in.Two Democratic senators are raising a new issue about Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for national security adviser: They are questioning whether he should be allowed to hold a security clearance, citing past investigations into charges that Mr. Flynn leaked classified information and into potential conflicts presented by a private intelligence firm he owns.His business, the Flynn Intel Group, has hazy ties to Middle Eastern countries and has appeared to lobby for the Turkish government, and that \u201ccreates potential for pressure, coercion and exploitation by foreign agents,\u201d the two senators, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, said in a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Office of Personnel Management.He also took a paid speaking engagement last year with Russia Today, a television network funded by the Kremlin, and sat next to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia at the network\u2019s lavish anniversary party in Moscow.In addition, Mr. Flynn was investigated, but cleared of any wrongdoing, in 2010 for sharing sensitive data with Pakistan about the Haqqani network, a faction of the Taliban, and for providing highly classified intelligence to British and Australian forces fighting in Afghanistan.But it is Mr. Flynn\u2019s business relationships that remain unresolved. He has said he plans to step back from the Flynn Intel Group and let his son, Michael G. Flynn, run it, according to the senators\u2019 letter, which was provided to The New York Times before its release on Wednesday.But that still does not settle the issue, the senators said.\u201cAny share of partnership profits he obtains from the Flynn Intel Group that are derived from its representation of a foreign government would appear to be a violation of his obligation as a retired general to abide by the emoluments clause of the constitution,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal and Ms. Shaheen wrote.Senate Democrats have found a new bit of leverage against Ms. DeVos, the Michigan Republican Party leader who will soon be considered for the cabinet post of education secretary: her unpaid fines for campaign finance violations.All Children Matter broke Ohio election law by illegally sending $870,000 from its national PAC to its Ohio affiliate.

Mr. Musk\u2019s electric car company, Tesla, and his other firms, including Solar City and SpaceX, have been criticized by rivals for using federal and state subsidies. Uber, Mr. Kalanick\u2019s ride-hailing business, has roiled the taxi industry and fought municipalities around the world for new regulations that allow it to operate.The forum, which includes the heads of Walt Disney and General Motors, will be led by Stephen A.

The group is charged with providing Mr. Trump with their individual views on how regulations affect jobs and economic growth.Mr. Trump\u2019s relationship with the tech sector has been tense.

He also criticized Amazon for its dominance, and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, for owning The Washington Post, which he said had been unfair in its campaign coverage of him.The announcement that Mr. Musk and Mr. Kalanick were joining his business policy group came ahead of a meeting with several tech leaders at Trump Tower on Wednesday, including Timothy D.

{"Headline": "The Central Banks Alone Can\u2019t Save Us", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byTurning PointsI have been coping with tennis elbow in one arm for most of this year and have had to rely much more on the other \u2014 excessively, it turns out. Entering the new year, there are now limits on what I can lift, pull and twist with either arm. Should I fail to do something about this, I could spend 2017 struggling with simple tasks, such as carrying a briefcase.In a way, this is an apt analogy for the global economy\u2019s disappointing performance in 2016, pointing to what\u2019s needed if we are to fight financial instability and worsening economic and political malaise in 2017.It was a tepid, strange year for the global economy. An already prolonged and frustrating period of insufficient and scattered growth simply continued as the world remained over-reliant on central banks.Since 2010, the use of fiscal policy, where the government adjusts its spending and taxation to manage the economy, has been hindered by the perception, especially in the United States and Europe, that such policies represent overreach. This has resulted in concerns about debt and unnecessary interference in the private sector, ushering in a period of excessive austerity, in terms of decreased government spending, in several advanced countries, such as Greece, Portugal and Spain. This has also sidelined any sustained fiscal stimulus in countries with strong balance sheets, such as Germany.The resulting fiscal paralysis, combined with insufficient progress on progrowth structural reforms \u2014 including revamping corporate taxes, building better infrastructure and training workers \u2014 hit those countries\u2019 middle and lower classes particularly hard and aggravated the impact of joblessness, especially among the young. As the pressure on household incomes increased, the prospects for consumer spending became more uncertain, and companies became less enthusiastic about investing in new plants and equipment, feeding into the cycle. Economic conditions remained difficult, and the politics of anger gained momentum.The need for greater fiscal policy flexibility attracted much more support among economists in 2016. But the effort to translate that support into action was frustrated by social and political polarization that essentially precluded any major economic policy initiative.As growth remained stuck in low gear, falling short of people\u2019s aspirations and dimming the hope of re-creating the economy of earlier years, the benefits of this limited growth were perceived to have collected disproportionately in the pockets of those who were better off already. Alarming pockets of under- and unemployment, particularly in Europe, became more deeply embedded in the economy\u2019s structure, adding to the headwinds. Popular anger continued to rise, and mistrust of the \u201cestablishment\u201d \u2014 both of government and the business sector \u2014 deepened. Economics, finance and politics became increasingly interlocked in a menacing, self-perpetuating cycle of disruption.Citizens of the United Kingdom voted in June to dismantle the country\u2019s deep trading and financial links with Europe, which have served it well for four decades. Antitrade rhetoric dominated the United States presidential election, from Donald J. Trump\u2019s threat of tariffs on China and Mexico to Hillary Clinton\u2019s distancing herself from trade agreements with Asia, South America and the European Union that the Obama administration had painstakingly negotiated. Trump\u2019s victory on Nov. 8 illustrated the growing influence of anti-establishment movements.With fiscal and structural policies impaired \u2014 with both arms incapacitated \u2014 central banks were the only game in town, in an economy that needed high, sustainable and inclusive growth. Since they enjoy a considerable degree of political autonomy, they felt morally obliged to do whatever they could, even though they lacked the proper tools for the task. For the most part, theirs are limited to monetary measures, where central banks influence the economy by adjusting interest rates and the money supply to change financial conditions and asset preferences.Despite their willingness to take on others\u2019 policy responsibilities, central bankers were unable to deliver on their objectives, and for good reasons: The supply impact of their tools, such as changing interest rates or buying and selling market securities, could not lift structural impediments to growth, such as a lack of infrastructure, fragmented tax regimes and excessive regulation; and the demand influences, like decreasing interest rates to spur consumption and investment, were too weak to power the economy forward in its current state. Yet, since they were the only institution with the flexibility to address the problems, the central banks refused to walk away, continuing to administer their imperfect \u2014 even experimental \u2014 prescriptions.The result included policy outcomes that, not so long ago, were virtually unthinkable. The Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank took their interest rates negative \u2014 that is, below 0 percent \u2014 leaving some investors in the highly unusual position of having to pay, rather than receive, interest income if they held government bonds. With that, around 30 percent of the total stock of global government debt traded with negative yield.During most of 2016, stock markets were unusually immune to the uncertainty that has dominated the economic, financial, institutional and political landscapes. For that, investors had liquidity to thank \u2014 that is, the continuous injection of money into the markets, whether from central banks\u2019 unconventional measures or the recycling of corporate cash through mergers, acquisitions and share buybacks. But there is a limit to how long this counterintuitive combination of unstable fundamentals and market calm can persist.While the exact timing of economic and financial turning points is inherently hard to predict, we could experience an important one in 2017. But that need not be a scary proposition if politicians resume their economic governance responsibilities.A comprehensive policy response would focus on pro-growth structural reforms (including tax reform), greater fiscal activism (particularly in building infrastructure), lifting pockets of over-indebtedness (for example, in Greece and, pre-emptively, for parts of student loans in the United States), and improving cross-border policy coordination (both at the global level and in strengthening the eurozone\u2019s regional economic architecture). This would unleash some of the considerable cash idling on corporate balance sheets, in that way turbocharging two critical transitions: from low growth to high and more inclusive growth, and from artificial financial stability to genuine financial stability.But if politicians continue to fail voters, low growth will risk turning into recession, artificial financial stability will give way to unsettling instability, and the politics of anger could get a lot messier. The alternatives we face are stark, and time is pressing.The treatment for tennis elbow is rest. Central bankers have been hitting the ball long enough \u2014 let\u2019s avoid a painful and more difficult 2017.Mohamed A.

{"Headline": "Elizabeth Warren Condemns the Wrong Man", "Date": "2016-12-12", "News": "Supported byDealBookShe took aim at an individual she described as a \u201chedge fund billionaire\u201d who is \u201cthrilled by Donald Trump\u2019s economic team of Wall Street insiders.\u201dThe hedge fund manager she condemned was Whitney Tilson, who runs Kase Capital. Ms. Warren \u2014 the fiery Massachusetts Democrat who is known for her stern mistrust of Wall Street \u2014 called him out by saying, \u201cTilson knows that, despite all the stunts and rhetoric, Donald Trump isn\u2019t going to change the economic system.\u201d Then she added, \u201cThe next four years are going to be a bonanza for the Whitney Tilsons of the world.\u201dThere\u2019s one rather glaring problem with Ms. Warren\u2019s attack: Mr. Tilson happens to be one of the few financial executives who publicly fought Mr. Trump\u2019s election and supported Hillary Clinton. A lifelong Democrat who was involved in helping to start Teach for America, Mr. Tilson also happened to be one of the rare Wall Street executives who had donated to Ms. Warren and actively sought new regulations for the industry. Recently, he gave Mrs. Clinton $1,000 so he could see Ms. Warren speak at a campaign fund-raiser. (He\u2019s also far, far from a billionaire.)Ms. Warren appears to be suffering from the same affliction that Mr. Trump\u2019s critics accuse of him: a knee-jerk, fact-free reaction to something she had read in the news.In this case, Ms. Warren seems to have come across a Bloomberg News article that includes some quotations from Mr. Tilson. But she didn\u2019t read to the bottom or dismissed it before firing off her zingers.The part Ms. Warren may have missed toward the bottom was this: \u201cI\u2019m a fan of Dodd-Frank, I think banking should be boring,\u201d he was quoted as saying, where he was also identified as a Clinton supporter. \u201cI worry about Wall Street returning to being a casino.\u201dIn fairness, depending on how you look at the situation, it is possible some readers and supporters of Ms. Warren will give her kudos for criticizing one of her own well-heeled donors. \u201cShe can\u2019t be bought,\u201d might be a generous way to consider the situation. But even a quick Google search of Mr. Tilson\u2019s involvement in the recent political discourse over financial reform would reveal what he clearly meant by his quotation: that he was nervous about Mr. Trump appointing reckless and uninformed people to guide financial policy and that he was heartened that he had not.As Ms. Warren has made clear, she abhors the idea of anyone who has worked in the financial industry working in government on policy that could affect the economy and Wall Street. This column has covered what I\u2019ve described as her misguided view.That\u2019s not to say any administration wouldn\u2019t benefit from bringing in some outsiders who could offer new and different perspectives, but that can\u2019t be a qualifying measure. The next time you need heart surgery, do you want to go to a heart surgeon or a psychologist?In fairness, Ms. Warren\u2019s ambitious efforts to overhaul financial regulation are not without merit: There are large parts of the Dodd-Frank Act that have done a ton of good to protect the American public. She played a hugely important role recently in grilling the chief executive of Wells Fargo about his bank\u2019s sham-accounts scandal, and her questioning appears to have helped bring about his resignation. And at a time when one party is in power \u2014 in this case, the Republicans \u2014 Ms. Warren\u2019s position is even more important to help hold our leaders accountable.However, her ad hominem attack on Mr. Tilson only serves to undermine her credibility and some of the good work she wants to achieve.To make matters worse, Mr. Tilson\u2019s wife, Susan Blackman Tilson, was one of the students in the first Harvard Law School bankruptcy class that Ms. Warren taught, in fall 1992. The student has remained loyal to her professor; Mrs. Tilson wrote in a letter to Ms. Warren last week that she had been \u201ccheering from the sidelines as you rose to national attention for your excellent work on behalf of consumers.\u201dBoth of the Tilsons sent letters to Ms. Warren last week, which they shared with me, seeking to set the record straight and asking her to remove her Facebook post.The response? An aide emailed them: \u201cShe asked me to relay to you that she is removing the word \u2018billionaire\u2019 from the post, as you have indicated that is factually inaccurate. The senator has decided, however, not to remove the overall post.\u201dA spokesman for Ms. Warren declined to comment on the exchange.When I spoke to Mr. Tilson on Monday, he said he felt that the senator had let him down in two ways: \u201cPersonally, I feel betrayed,\u201d he said. \u201cIn recent years, I\u2019ve really stuck my neck out by very publicly supporting her, the C.F.P.B., and a tough regulatory approach to banks \u2014 none of which wins me many friends \u2014 and this is how she repays me.\u201dMr. Tilson added: \u201cBy engaging in factually incorrect, ad hominem attacks, she\u2019s getting down into the gutter with Trump. This is misguided and counterproductive.\u201dDespite all of that, he said, \u201cI still support her because I share her belief that banking should be boring.\u201dNaturally enough, he added, her Facebook post, coupled with her response, \u201ccertainly reduces my enthusiasm for her.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Spent Far Less Than Clinton, but Paid His Companies Well", "Date": "2016-12-09", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Donald J. Trump won the White House after spending a little more than half of what Hillary Clinton did, using a combination of his own money and contributions from donors big and small to fuel a campaign that shattered the modern conventions of money and politics.The figures for the final weeks of the campaign, released late Thursday, showed that Mr. Trump paid his own companies nearly $12 million over the course of the election \u2014 reimbursement for flights, hotel stays, meals and services for him and his staff members, as well as office space in the tower he owns on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. His preferred mode of transportation \u2014 his private aircraft \u2014 made up the largest chunk of money that went back into Trump entities, $8.7 million.The figures also show that Mr. Trump put in $65 million of his own cash, well short of the $100 million he had originally promised he would spend on his campaign.Over all, Mr. Trump raised far less money than Mrs. Clinton did, though the disparity \u2014 like the race itself \u2014 closed at the end of the campaign. The Clinton campaign brought in $70 million from Oct. 20 to Nov. 28, compared with $86 million for the Trump campaign, of which $10 million came from Mr. Trump\u2019s own pocket.The combined figures, which include what each campaign and its outside allies raised, reinforce just how little money seemed to matter in this election. Mrs. Clinton and her allies took in about $1 billion; Mr. Trump and the groups working on his behalf raised only about $600 million.Sustained at times by little more than a Twitter account, his own money and extensive news media coverage, Mr. Trump relied far less on the traditional tools of campaigning. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign was more dependent on television advertising, spending hundreds of millions of dollars on almost relentlessly negative attacks.At a time when every presidential election promises to obliterate spending records, 2016 was an exception. Both candidates spent significantly less than their counterparts did in 2012. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s total expenses were $565 million, compared with $775 million for President Obama; Mr. Trump spent $322 million, while Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee that year, spent $460 million.Mrs. Clinton closed with under $1 million in the bank, much less than the $7 million remaining for the Trump campaign.Though Mr. Trump would often brag that he was financing his own campaign, that was only partially true. The new disclosures show that nearly 80 percent of the money his campaign brought in came from donors.The disclosures also undercut another theme that was central to Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal as an antipolitician \u2014 his insistence that he would not favor wealthy donors and powerful interests if elected.Some of his high-level nominees, who include millionaires and billionaires, made large donations to his campaign or to \u201csuper PACs\u201d supporting him. For example, Linda McMahon, the professional wrestling mogul whom Mr. Trump has chosen to lead the Small Business Administration, donated $7 million to two pro-Trump groups. The records also show that the men he intends to nominate for his secretaries of Labor, Treasury and Commerce all made six-figure contributions to his campaign, the Republican National Committee or another group supporting him.Still, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign also benefited from a far-reaching network of ordinary Americans who gave small amounts of money, an illustration of his powerful grass-roots appeal. Sixty-five percent of the amount donors gave directly to his campaign came from people who donated $200 or less.The financial fortunes of the political parties are also reflected in the outcome of the campaign, with Democrats in worse shape than Republicans as they head into 2017. The Democratic National Committee reported having $13 million on hand and $2 million in debt. The Republican National Committee has $21 million on hand and no debt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Internet Throws Lifeline to Family Businesses in Small Town in Italy\u2019s South", "Date": "2016-12-08", "News": "Supported bySoveria Mannelli JournalSOVERIA MANNELLI, Italy \u2014 Mario Caligiuri can still recall the night that may be credited with changing the fortunes of Soveria Mannelli.It was New Year\u2019s Eve at the turn of the millennium, and as mayor he dashed off an email to the authorities in Rome seeking an audience to explain his initiative to connect his struggling mountaintop town of about 3,000 inhabitants to the internet.For generations Soveria Mannelli had been a lively outpost, situated strategically along the main road that ran from south of Naples to the toe of Italy. But after the government built a highway in the 1970s closer to the coast, traffic was diverted. Soveria Mannelli was left cut off.Mr. Caligiuri, like many others here, had refused to leave \u201cout of a sentiment of affection,\u201d he said. He was determined to bridge the logistical hurdles of the town\u2019s isolation.\u201cI had understood that new technologies created economic development, but that was that,\u201d recalled Mr. Caligiuri, who is now a professor. \u201cBut it was only when the government summoned me to Rome that I knew I was doing something good.\u201dMr. Caligiuri, 56, served five consecutive terms as mayor over 18 years. And Soveria Mannelli successfully harnessed the digital age to its longstanding work culture, reviving its family-run businesses and turning the town into a model of innovation for Italy\u2019s underdeveloped south.Soveria Mannelli now has a thriving, medium-size publishing house, a leading school furniture manufacturer and an ancient wool mill, all run by families that have been able to maintain their roots here by updating their businesses to accommodate the digital era.The town\u2019s combination of longstanding administrative stability, forward-looking mayors and a vibrant entrepreneurial spirit has made it a standout in the region.\u201cIt\u2019s a case study that clearly shows how a functional and stable administration can help businesses grow, and that a small community can nurture a real business culture, also in Italy\u2019s south,\u201d said Pier Luigi Sacco, a professor of cultural economics at IULM University in Milan.At the same time, he noted, for such a small place, Soveria Mannelli has an unusual range and concentration of skills that make its success hard to replicate elsewhere.\u201cI fear it\u2019d be hard to scale it up,\u201d Professor Sacco added. \u201cThe polyphony of talents in such a tiny village would be unusual almost anywhere in the world.\u201dIt was that kind of expansion that helped Florindo Rubbettino, 45, make his family\u2019s publishing house thrive in Soveria Mannelli, where his father, Rosario, founded it in 1972.\u201cWe are far from Milan, and it can take a day to deliver books on the market, but it\u2019s our challenge, and till today, we never thought of leaving,\u201d Mr. Rubbettino said. \u201cThe work culture and the quality of relations in a small territory like this are priceless.\u201dTo reduce logistical costs and keep an eye on the production quality, Rubbettino Publishing House built an integrated cycle inside its large warehouse in Soveria Mannelli.Over 80 employees edit, print and package 300 new books a year for the Italian market, generating a turnover of about 8 million euros (approximately $8.6 million).Camillo Sirianni, a third-generation family business that began as a mechanized carpentry company in 1909, has also overcome the isolation of its hometown to become a leading manufacturer of school furniture.In a high-tech warehouse on the outskirts of town, the company today assembles thousands of colorful desks, benches, closets and other accessories made from Calabrian beech that are shipped across the globe, from the United Kingdom to the United Arab Emirates, from Central America to Polynesia.For many years, the company\u2019s worst logistical hurdle was the narrowness of the road (which has since been widened), bordered by tall oak trees, that led to the main highway.\u201cOf course, good roads facilitate entrepreneurship, but it\u2019s not the only thing needed to develop economically,\u201d said Francesco Sirianni, the company\u2019s export manager. \u201cIf you are on the web, it doesn\u2019t matter where you are today.\u201dThe company has been using the internet since 1996, and has had its own website since 1999. Sometimes it still happens that, during a Skype call, their clients worry about the transportation time, but the Siriannis have it all worked out.For close deliveries, they rely on couriers who drive from Italy\u2019s productive north to its consumer-oriented south and back. A large, nearby port helps with more distant destinations.\u201cOver time, if proprietors and workers do not have a solid work culture, infrastructure can do little to make a business thrive,\u201d Angelo Sirianni, the company\u2019s general manager, said.That traditional work culture is on display at Soveria Mannelli\u2019s oldest factory, the Lanificio Leo, called the \u201cwool machine.\u201dFounded in 1873, it was the first \u2014 and now last \u2014 machine-operated wool mill in Calabria. It employed 50 people until the 1970s, when national policies to develop Italy\u2019s south encouraged larger-scale or state-run production at the expense of small businesses.The wool mill was on standby for about two decades, until Emilio Salvatore Leo, 41, started inviting international designers and artists to summer residencies in Soveria Mannelli.With their inspiration, he tried to envision a future for his mill and over the years has transformed his family\u2019s mill into a brand that makes clothing and home goods.Mr. Leo\u2019s century-old machines now weave wool from Australia and New Zealand, cashmere from Nepal and cotton from Egypt and South America. He calls it a \u201cstart-up on scrap metals,\u201d referring to the dozens of different looms that his family acquired over the years.\u201cThe issue here is not the speed at which we produce,\u201d he said, sitting in his studio full of books on the art of weaving, international design and economics. Elaborate green and gray trapezoidal mantles dangled from a hanger nearby. \u201cItaly can\u2019t compete with low-cost textiles.\u201dHe added, \u201cI asked myself how I could use a 100-year-old loom to produce cloth, and the answer I found was in the same way as a 3D printer, so I started studying projects to adapt my design production to my ancient technology.\u201dMr. Leo\u2019s business is significantly smaller than those of his friends in Soveria Mannelli, but he has already won some international design awards, teaches workshops all over the world and is about to open an online store on his website.Still, he dreams of going back to weaving threads directly from sheep wool and maybe even having his own Calabrian sheep, as his ancestors did.\u201cThe real challenge is to preserve this place, maintain a contemporary approach,\u201d Mr. Leo said. \u201cThe past doesn\u2019t need to be contemplated, but utilized. That\u2019s what we are doing here.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Trump Economic Boom? The Fed May Stand in the Way", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byPresident-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s promises to cut taxes and regulation and to increase spending on infrastructure and defense have convinced many that a sugar high in the near term will goose the economy. But Fed officials say the economy is already expanding at something close to its maximum sustainable pace, meaning faster growth would drive inflation toward unwelcome levels.To avoid overheating, the Fed could respond by raising interest rates more quickly. The more Mr. Trump stimulates growth, the faster the Fed is likely to increase rates.\u201cI guess I would argue that I think people have gotten a bit ahead of themselves about what a Trump presidency would mean,\u201d said Lewis Alexander, chief United States economist at Nomura. \u201cIf we have a big stimulus, the logical thing for the Fed to do is to raise rates faster. There isn\u2019t a whole heck of a lot of scope to just let the economy run under those circumstances. There\u2019s a big question about whether fiscal stimulus under Trump just leads to higher interest rates.\u201dUnderscoring that question, the Fed is expected to raise its benchmark rate on Wednesday for the first time since last December in light of new economic data. The rate sits in a range of 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent, a low level intended to stimulate economic growth by encouraging borrowing and risk-taking. Analysts predict the Fed will shift the range upward by a quarter of a percentage point, modestly reducing those incentives.Federal Reserve officials have delayed raising rates this year as they wrestle with three critical questions. But they may soon be about to act.Economic forecasts always require large assumptions, but that is particularly true in the present case because Mr. Trump has provided relatively few details about his plans. Perhaps the most accurate thing that can be said about Mr. Trump\u2019s victory is that it has increased the uncertainty of the economic outlook.During his campaign, Mr. Trump predicted 4 percent annual growth, and his actions since Election Day point to a single-minded goal of short-term job creation.\u201cOur No. 1 priority is going to be the economy, get back to 3 to 4 percent growth,\u201d Steven Mnuchin, Mr. Trump\u2019s pick to serve as Treasury secretary, said last month.Many economists regard such growth predictions as fanciful; the economy has been mired in an extended period of slow growth and the reasons, including an aging population and a dearth of innovation, are unlikely to change quickly. Some think Mr. Trump is more likely to push the economy into recession than to catalyze a new boom.Exactly seven years ago, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to almost zero in order to nurse the ailing economy back to health. Recently it changed direction. This is how it works.Even if Mr. Trump is right, however, the Fed does not want 4 percent growth.The central bank\u2019s outlook has become increasingly gloomy. Officials estimated in September that annual growth of 1.8 percent was the maximum sustainable pace, and they predicted growth would not exceed 2 percent in the next three years. They will update those forecasts Wednesday, but large shifts are unlikely.For years, Fed officials urged Congress to increase fiscal spending. Now, Mr. Trump is promising to do just that \u2014 and the Fed has concluded that it is too late.Stanley Fischer, the Fed\u2019s vice chairman, said last month the Fed might still benefit from fiscal stimulus because it could raise rates more quickly. That would increase the Fed\u2019s ability to respond to future downturns by reducing interest rates.\u201cWith the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio at around 77 percent, there\u2019s not a lot of fiscal space, should a shock to the economy occur, an adverse shock, that did require fiscal stimulus,\u201d she said.The tension between fiscal and monetary policy is likely to unfold in slow motion.Mr. Trump has promised to press for rapid changes in government policy, but Congress is not built for speed. A similar effort to cut taxes at the beginning of the George W. Bush administration, for example, was signed into law on June 7, 2001. The impact of new cuts, and any increase in infrastructure spending that Mr. Trump can persuade dubious Republicans to embrace, would be felt mostly in future years.Mark M. Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, predicted that tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks and deficit-financed spending would fuel faster growth in the first half of Mr. Trump\u2019s four-year term. But he said that the Fed\u2019s rate increases, and restrictions on trade and immigration, would gradually begin to take a larger toll. By the end, Mr. Zandi predicted, the American economy would be \u201cunnervingly close\u201d to recession.\u201cThe Fed and markets in general will ultimately wash out any benefit,\u201d Mr. Zandi said Monday. \u201cThe economy under President Trump ultimately will be diminished.\u201dOther economists are more optimistic, predicting that the stimulus will not be fully offset by Fed policy. Mr. Dudley appeared to endorse this view in his recent speech, suggesting that the rise in financial markets was \u201cbroadly appropriate.\u201dSome of Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals also could increase the economy\u2019s potential growth rate, for example by improving infrastructure or encouraging corporate investment.On the other hand, the Fed\u2019s march toward higher rates may be amplified by the bond market. Rates are already rising, and investors concerned about inflation and larger federal deficits are likely to generate persistent upward pressure.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaumAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Despite Sanctions, Russia Finds Buyers for $11 Billion Stake in Rosneft", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 The Russian government announced Wednesday that it will sell nearly 20 percent of its state oil company, Rosneft, to the Swiss commodity trading firm Glencore and the sovereign wealth fund of Qatar.The deal defies expectations that no investor would dare buy a share in the Russian asset, given Western sanctions against the government of President Vladimir V. Putin.But the emergence of foreign money suggests that investors are reassessing the sanctions after the election of Donald J. Trump, who has advocated warming ties with authorities in Moscow and is considering the chairman of Exxon Mobil, Rex W. Tillerson, as a candidate for secretary of state.Mr. Tillerson criticized the sanctions as harmful for business after they halted an Exxon joint venture with Rosneft to drill for oil in the Kara Sea, in Russia\u2019s sector of the Arctic Ocean.The deal will bring Moscow $11.3 billion to help plug a widening budget deficit as Russia fights two wars, in Syria and Ukraine, and has struggled to meet pension payments and public-sector payrolls.The agreement came as a surprise twist in the privatization of Rosneft. With an end-of-the-year deadline looming, no buyers had come forward for the 19.5 percent share in the world\u2019s largest publicly traded oil company, as measured by production and reserves. The apparent lack of bidders was a pessimistic sign for investor interest in Russia.The Russian government had for most of the year planned to sell shares back to the majority state-owned company itself, which would hardly have qualified as a genuine privatization.The sanctions limit long-term lending and transfer of American technology for drilling offshore and shale oil deposits.The deal carries other risks as well. Both Glencore and the Qatari fund, the Qatar Investment Authority, have extensive investments in emerging markets. The Qatar fund is also an investor in Glencore.The announced price valued Rosneft at $58 billion, slightly less than the company\u2019s stock market value at the close of trading in Moscow on Wednesday, of just under $59 billion.Both the market price of shares and the sale price for the 19.5 percent stake announced Wednesday are a relative bargain, indicating the Russian government\u2019s eagerness to cut a deal to shore up its finances.Rosneft pumps 4.7 million barrels of oil and the energy equivalent in natural gas a day, compared with 4.3 million by Exxon. For comparison, Exxon\u2019s market value was $364 billion during trading Wednesday \u2014 six times Rosneft\u2019s value.The two buyers will take equal parts of the stake, the company\u2019s chief executive, Igor I. Sechin, told Mr. Putin in a televised meeting Wednesday.Mr. Putin termed it \u201cthe largest privatization deal, the largest sale and acquisition in the global oil and gas sector in 2016.\u201dIn a statement, Glencore said it was in \u201cfinal stage negotiations\u201d over the deal. The company said it would contribute 300 million euros, or $323 million, of its stock to the purchase, with the remainder of the funding coming from the Qatari fund and bank financing. Under the terms, Glencore would gain access to an additional 220,000 barrels a day of Rosneft\u2019s oil to trade.Mr. Sechin credited Mr. Putin for the agreement. \u201cGiven the very difficult economic circumstances and the extremely tight deadlines for this kind of project,\u201d Mr. Sechin said, \u201cI can report to you that we were able to land this deal thanks to your personal contribution.\u201dThe sale completes a long arc for the Russian energy assets, traced from privatization to nationalization to privatization again, with the timing unfavorable for the Russian citizens who are the company\u2019s majority owner.Under Mr. Putin, the Russian government took oil and gas fields that had been privatized in the early post-Soviet period by companies including Yukos and TNK, and reassembled them under a behemoth state-owned company, arguing that the government should steer policy for these strategic assets.The government effectively nationalized Yukos in lawsuits over unpaid taxes after its founder, the oil tycoon Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, was jailed on fraud charges brought with political overtones.Rosneft bought the assets of TNK and its foreign partner, BP, for about $60 billion in 2013, when oil prices were still buoyant. Now the government is selling shares into the depressed global oil market for a fraction of what it paid three years ago.A state holding company, Rosneftegaz, is the largest shareholder, with 69.5 percent, which will drop to 50 percent after the sale to Glencore and the Qatari fund. A state property agency holds a voting share to retain majority state control.BP, the British oil giant, owns a 19.75 percent, and the remainder is traded on the London Stock Exchange and in Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "India Hobbles Through a Cash Crisis, and Electronic Payments Boom", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byMr. Mandal is among millions of Indians \u2014 snack vendors and rickshaw drivers, cobblers and coconut-water sellers \u2014 who are moving swiftly toward a cashless economy, fulfilling what Prime Minister Narendra Modi now says was one of his objectives in banning 500- and 1,000-rupee notes, worth about $7.40 and $14.80.India is experiencing an acute shortage of bills to replace the large-denomination notes that were banned as of Nov. 9, and which made up 86 percent of the country\u2019s currency. There have been numerous reports of people waiting in line for hours at banks or A.T.M.s, only to find that the machines are out of cash.As the public struggles with too few bills in circulation, business has fallen in many sectors to a small fraction of what it was before the ban. Economists warn that India\u2019s growth of 7.3 percent in the most recent quarter, among the fastest of any large economy, could take a hit if the cash shortage continues.\u201cAfter the currency ban, my sales came down sharply,\u201d said Mr. Mandal, who sells dumplings from a handcart in a market in the New Ashok Nagar neighborhood. \u201cProviding change was a big problem.\u201dAfter a customer suggested that he take electronic payments, he downloaded software that allows him to accept such transactions on his phone. Forty percent of his sales are now conducted electronically, he says.Even merchants who do not have smartphones are contemplating buying one. \u201cIf people are flying in planes, how long we can ride on bullock cart?\u201d asked Sunil Jaiswal, who charges less than $2 to repair watches in an alley near Connaught Place.To be effective, the move had to be a closely guarded secret until the last minute, to prevent those holding black money from unloading it before the ban went into effect \u2014 the morning after the decision was announced. As a result, the government did not print enough replacement cash in time for the change, and it continues to struggle to do so fast enough, creating a cash shortage that has strangled large sectors of the economy.But Indians are switching to electronic payments more rapidly than many experts had predicted, and in speaking of the recent currency moves, Mr. Modi has begun emphasizing the benefits of a cashless economy over the anticorruption fight.Across the country, about 70,000 merchants a day are signing up for India\u2019s best-selling mobile payments platform, Paytm, about 14 times as many as the daily average before the currency decision, said Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder and chief executive of Paytm and One97 Communications, the start-up behind it.Since the large-currency ban, the number of daily transactions on Paytm has grown to nearly six million, an increase of 350 percent, and the service is adding half a million users each day, Mr. Sharma said.\u201cEarlier, we were the innovator, now we are the mainstream,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the start of the golden age for financial technology companies.\u201dMore than 230 million people in India use electronic wallets, the finance minister, Arun Jaitley, said, representing nearly one-fifth of the country\u2019s population.At the same time, the government has tasked banks in the country with adding one million machines in stores to process credit and debit card transactions by March 2017, a two-thirds increase from the 1.5 million available today.The number of credit and debit card machines that have been added since the large-currency ban was put in place is not yet available. But Icici Bank, one of India\u2019s biggest private lenders, says it has detected a sharp increase in demand from merchants processing debit and credit card charges. A spokeswoman for Icici said that the bank had installed six times as many machines last week as it did, on average, before the limit on high-denomination bills.Still, A. P. Hota, managing director and chief executive of the National Payments Corporation of India, an umbrella group for sellers of retail payment systems, said that he was skeptical the government could achieve its goal of adding one million new credit and debit card machines in a few months, calling it \u201ca gigantic task.\u201d The infrastructure is not yet in place to process the paperwork involved and to teach merchants how to use the machines, he said.\u201cA merchant will have several legitimate queries, like how to reconcile the payments, how to get money, if there is a problem, whom to contact,\u201d Mr. Hota said. \u201cThere has to be an infrastructure to handle these queries.\u201dIn part because of increased demand from small and midsize merchants, as well as from government departments, the number of credit and debit card transactions has soared to 10 million a day, more than three times as many as before November, said Deepak Chandnani, managing director for South Asia and the Middle East of Worldline India Private Limited, a division of the French company Atos. Worldline produces about a third of the machines used to process these charges in India.One97, the owner of Paytm, has hired 3,500 employees in the last month, 50 percent more than it had hired in the previous two years, the company\u2019s founder, Mr. Sharma, said. Unable to meet demand from merchants seeking help setting up the systems, the company ran newspaper advertisements with instructions to help business owners do it themselves. The ads also serve as posters for merchants to advertise that they use Paytm.Saurabh Porwal, 31, who sells onions on the roadside in Harola Market in Noida, a city near Delhi, downloaded the Paytm app after seeing the newspaper advertisement, which he then posted on his stall. \u201cIf you deal in less cash, it is less of a problem,\u201d he says.Moving toward a cashless economy would carry benefits for the government, ensuring that more taxes are paid and providing banks with more reserves to extend loans. About 78 percent of transactions in India last year were made in cash, compared with 20 percent in the United States, a joint study by Google India and Boston Consulting Group found.Still, those adopting cashless technology are a minority. At Janpath Cloth Market in Delhi, where vendors shout out discounted prices to passers-by, only one of more than 100 open-air shops advertised a cashless system.Amit Maheshwari, who sells men\u2019s pants, displays a white piece of paper on his stall saying, in bold type, \u201cPaytm Accepted Here.\u201dAfter the currency change, sales at the shop fell to about 10 percent of what they were before, he said. Then a customer who was browsing said he would buy some pants if he could use Paytm. \u201cWe had no idea what this was,\u201d Mr. Maheshwari said. \u201cHe taught us how to use it.\u201dSince adopting Paytm, sales have risen to 50 percent of what they were before the currency change, he said. \u201cEverybody should use it. Anybody can use it,\u201d he said.But many vendors around India are still resistant. Mustkeem Ahemad, 38, who sells chicken in Harola Market, says that electronic payment systems are too complex for him.\u201cHow can you pay on a phone? Only an educated person can do it,\u201d he said. \u201cI am illiterate, so I just can\u2019t do it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Approach to Corporate Tax Law Has House G.O.P. Support", "Date": "2016-12-12", "News": "Supported byPresident-elect Donald J. Trump has vowed to protect and create American manufacturing jobs, even threatening high tariffs on imports to help achieve that goal. So far, though, his plan seems to lean heavily on one-at-a-time deals, like the one struck late last month to save jobs at the Carrier plant in Indianapolis.\u201cIt would be the biggest change in business tax law ever in the United States,\u201d said Martin A. Sullivan, the chief economist at Tax Analysts, a nonprofit tax research organization and publisher. \u201cIt might actually work, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a partisan issue.\u201dA central idea is that goods would be taxed based on where they were consumed rather than where they were produced, meaning that imports would be taxed by Washington while exports would not. Tax experts call this a destination-based consumption tax.This would be a sharp departure for the United States in a number of ways, but taxing imports but not exports is in step with nearly all of America\u2019s trading partners, which have so-called value-added taxes. The import-and-export tax treatment is known as border adjustment.The proposed overhaul would have other changes. The cost of capital investments would be deducted immediately rather than depreciated over years, but interest costs would no longer be deductible.The package of ideas has evolved over years, mainly in academic circles. Its principal intellectual champion in the United States is Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. Mr. Auerbach\u2019s goal, he said, is to transform the economics of the corporate tax system so that \u201cincentives will align with the national interest.\u201dThe destination-based concept, according to Mr. Auerbach, is an adaptation to the modern economy of open borders and advancing technology. Much business value is now in intellectual property like patents and software.Multinationals are adept at shifting these intangible assets to low-tax nations as a way to shelter profits and avoid taxes. A destination-based system, focusing on where a product is consumed, would be much simplified, eliminating incentives to game the system, Mr. Auerbach said.By not taxing exports, he said, it would \u201cstrongly encourage American companies to locate activities in the United States.\u201dBut critics say this is wishful thinking, divorced from the reality of international trade laws, Washington lobbying and corporate financial engineering. Major features of Mr. Auerbach\u2019s design, they say, will probably be jettisoned to appease domestic interests or conform to trade rules. A new system might curb some tax gaming, they say, but not stop it.What will remain, they predict, will be the House proposal to sharply reduce the corporate tax rate. \u201cThe result will be a giant corporate tax cut that benefits the rich because most of the owners are rich,\u201d said Robert McIntyre, the director of Citizens for Tax Justice. \u201cEveryone loses except those at the top.\u201dMr. Auerbach, 65, became fascinated by the mechanics and impact of tax policy while pursuing his doctorate at Harvard, encouraged by his thesis adviser, Martin Feldstein, a chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Reagan administration.Mr. Auerbach was an adviser to John Kerry, the Democratic nominee for president in 2004. But Mr. Auerbach has long been a registered independent. \u201cI like to keep conversations open with both sides,\u201d he said. \u201cI think of myself as an economist first, and that the evidence should dictate the policy.\u201dHis research on tax policy has increasingly focused on the global context. So has the study of other economists. In 2001, in a conference at Berkeley, Michael Devereux was the co-author of a paper with Stephen R. Bond that introduced the term destination-based corporate tax.In recent years, Mr. Auerbach and Mr. Devereux have cooperated in developing the idea and working through how it might be put into effect. \u201cWe\u2019re kindred spirits, for sure,\u201d said Mr. Devereux, a professor at the Sa\u00efd Business School at the University of Oxford.For years, Mr. Auerbach has been making that case on trips to Washington. There has been some interest at times. In 2005, a bipartisan presidential advisory panel on tax reform included his idea as one option, but it went nowhere.But the real political endorsement came this year, when Representative Kevin Brady, a conservative Texas Republican and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, introduced corporate tax overhaul proposals. His blueprint includes most of Mr. Auerbach\u2019s recommendations. The House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, now vows to pursue tax legislation that would cut both business and personal taxes.Mr. Brady\u2019s plan calls for lowering the corporate tax to 20 percent, from 35 percent. Mr. Auerbach, who has met with Mr. Brady, did not advocate a specific rate, but he said 20 percent was a \u201csolid rate that is often discussed.\u201d (Mr. Trump has proposed lowering the corporate rate to 15 percent.)In an interview, Mr. Brady said a destination-based system would \u201clevel the playing field for made-in-America products.\u201dHe added, \u201cIt removes all the incentives to move jobs, research and headquarters overseas.\u201dMr. Brady and his staff have met with Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers. \u201cI\u2019m convinced the Trump team will want to work with us,\u201d he said.But they may not agree with the entire House package. Eliminating interest deductions would hurt businesses that rely heavily on debt financing, like real estate developers and Wall Street financiers, many of whom have been Trump backers.And the plan is already stirring resistance elsewhere, dividing business interests even more than experts who split along ideological lines.Companies that import goods or import a large portion of the parts and materials that go into their products will most likely be worse off, at least initially.Many retailers fall into that camp. David French, the senior vice president for government relations at the National Retail Federation, said his group, while still studying the plan, considered it \u201can exotic economics lab experiment.\u201d Retailers, he added, were \u201cvery concerned about practical effect of this on profits, jobs and operations.\u201dMr. Auerbach said the retailers\u2019 worries were misplaced. If, in the short term, exports rise and imports fall, the value of the dollar should increase in step with the higher demand for dollars. Retailers, he said, will \u201cmake up in a stronger dollar what they lose in higher tax payments.\u201dMr. French, of the retail trade group, is unconvinced, saying it would be a risky bet to be making with the nation\u2019s $2.6 trillion retail industry.At the National Association of Manufacturers, which counts 14,000 members from corporations and private companies, Dorothy Coleman, the vice president for tax and domestic economic policy, called the initial Brady plan a \u201cthoughtful attempt to break out of the gridlock\u201d on tax simplification in recent years.But even some manufacturers have concerns. Last week, Koch Industries, a private industrial corporation run by Charles G. and David H. Koch, prominent Republican supporters, said the \u201cborder adjustment\u201d provision of the House plan could be \u201cdevastating\u201d to the economy. In a statement, the company said it would \u201cgreatly benefit\u201d in the short term as a large exporter, but warned that the American economy would suffer from less free trade and higher consumer prices.Mr. Auerbach\u2019s approach, embraced by the Brady proposal, will also face a hurdle at the World Trade Organization. Among its provisions is to allow American companies to deduct domestic wages from taxation, which makes it less costly to employ workers and helps them offset the higher price of imported goods. A wage deduction is not currently permitted under W.T.O. rules, and is likely to be seen as an unfair subsidy to American companies and a trade barrier.But Mr. Auerbach replies that his system is the \u201ceconomic equivalent\u201d of policies that comply with W.T.O. rules \u2014 a value-added tax that is border-adjusted, combined with a reduction in payroll taxes and lowering income taxes.Michael Graetz, a tax expert at the Columbia Law School, said he doubted that argument would prevail in Geneva. \u201cW.T.O. lawyers do not take the view that things that look the same economically are acceptable,\u201d Mr. Graetz said. \u201cThey don\u2019t behave the way Alan might like.\u201d\u201cEconomists don\u2019t rule the world; I understand that,\u201d Mr. Auerbach said. \u201cYou never know when or if your policy ideas will have an impact.\u201dAn earlier version of this article, using information supplied by an executive at the National Association of Manufacturers, misstated the number of members in the association. It is 14,000, not 12,000.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Donald J. Trump Could Promote Long-Term Economic Growth", "Date": "2016-12-27", "News": "Supported byAnother ViewDespite hand-wringing before the election that a Trump presidency would presage near-term and long-term calamity, giddy equity markets responded to a Republican sweep of the White House and Congress with a more sanguine view. Such a response makes sense if a pro-growth policy is indeed much more likely, but it also lays bare steps the new administration and its economic team need to take to justify that optimism.While there are many issues on the new team\u2019s economic plate, one should take precedence over the others: restarting economic growth.Business people and households need to believe that faster sustained growth is possible. Structural problems \u2014 exacerbated by public policies of the past several years and a stimulus mind-set \u2014 have fed pessimism, restraining investment in capital and people.Now, expectations can be reset through the core elements of President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s economic plan, if they are coordinated, implemented and explained well. Here is what\u2019s needed:Two building blocks to raise productivity are tax reform and regulatory reform. Tax reform can raise investment and productivity by significantly reducing marginal tax rates on business income, while broadening the tax base. There is no arrow in the policy quiver that dominates fundamental tax reform in raising incomes \u2014 economists estimate gains as large as a 0.5 percentage-point increase in economic growth annually for a decade. These gains come principally from raising investment in the United States and reducing wasteful tax distortions of business planning. Regulatory reform is a second building block for growth by weakening impediments to investment in energy and utilities, while overhauling financial regulation to improve credit availability for small and midsize firms.Work is vital for growth, incomes and social dignity. Tax reform is a core element here, too \u2014 raising returns to work by reducing tax rates on incremental earnings. But broader support for work is needed economically, and its absence figured in the understandable economic anxiety during the campaign.These additional building blocks provide this broader support for work. First, market-based health care reforms \u2014 widely analyzed before the Affordable Care Act\u2019s more regulatory approach \u2014 can slow the rate of growth of health care costs. This slowing is important, as it permits compensation to workers to shift toward wages, raising incomes.Second, we should strengthen substantially the earned-income tax credit for childless workers to encourage and support entry-level work and the earnings-building skills that work provides.Third, current spending on unwieldy federal job training programs can be directed toward personal re-employment accounts for income support and enhanced personalized training for individuals who are most likely to experience long-lasting unemployment given economic dislocations from technological change or domestic or foreign competition.A substantial federal infrastructure spending program can support the building blocks of pro-growth policy in raising expectations. But to do so, it needs three elements. First, it should be a long-term commitment. There are few shovel-ready projects available for stimulus. A long-term commitment raises business people\u2019s expectations of future demand and increased labor demand. Second, an infrastructure program should be a partnership, bankrolled by federal, state, local and also private funds, with the mix depending on the project. And regulations should be streamlined to reduce costs and increase the speed of new construction.To the extent that part of the federal financing of an infrastructure program is linked to corporate tax changes, the program needs to be ready to accompany tax reform. Otherwise, especially given that program design is complex, infrastructure could follow tax reform in the pro-growth policy change.While constructive in its early strong response to the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has been depended upon too much by a government not willing to tackle bold reforms. The continuing hyper-accommodative monetary policy in the more normal current economic environment misallocates credit, punishes savers and favors financial engineering over productivity-enhancing real investment.Early equity market gains after Mr. Trump\u2019s election offer a vote of optimism in the potential impact of a different economic policy direction.Now, the right building blocks, action and communication can sustain that optimism and generate higher incomes and greater opportunity.R. Glenn Hubbard, dean of Columbia Business School, was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Perfect Weapon: How Russian Cyberpower Invaded the U.S.", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When Special Agent Adrian Hawkins of the Federal Bureau of Investigation called the Democratic National Committee in September 2015 to pass along some troubling news about its computer network, he was transferred, naturally, to the help desk.The F.B.I. knew it well: The bureau had spent the last few years trying to kick the Dukes out of the unclassified email systems of the White House, the State Department and even the Joint Chiefs of Staff, one of the government\u2019s best-protected networks.Yared Tamene, the tech-support contractor at the D.N.C. who fielded the call, was no expert in cyberattacks. His first moves were to check Google for \u201cthe Dukes\u201d and conduct a cursory search of the D.N.C. computer system logs to look for hints of such a cyberintrusion. By his own account, he did not look too hard even after Special Agent Hawkins called back repeatedly over the next several weeks \u2014 in part because he wasn\u2019t certain the caller was a real F.B.I. agent and not an impostor.\u201cI had no way of differentiating the call I just received from a prank call,\u201d Mr. Tamene wrote in an internal memo, obtained by The New York Times, that detailed his contact with the F.B.I.It was the cryptic first sign of a cyberespionage and information-warfare campaign devised to disrupt the 2016 presidential election, the first such attempt by a foreign power in American history. What started as an information-gathering operation, intelligence officials believe, ultimately morphed into an effort to harm one candidate, Hillary Clinton, and tip the election to her opponent, Donald J. Trump.Like another famous American election scandal, it started with a break-in at the D.N.C. The first time, 44 years ago at the committee\u2019s old offices in the Watergate complex, the burglars planted listening devices and jimmied a filing cabinet. This time, the burglary was conducted from afar, directed by the Kremlin, with spear-phishing emails and zeros and ones.An examination by The Times of the Russian operation \u2014 based on interviews with dozens of players targeted in the attack, intelligence officials who investigated it and Obama administration officials who deliberated over the best response \u2014 reveals a series of missed signals, slow responses and a continuing underestimation of the seriousness of the cyberattack.The D.N.C.\u2019s fumbling encounter with the F.B.I. meant the best chance to halt the Russian intrusion was lost. The failure to grasp the scope of the attacks undercut efforts to minimize their impact. And the White House\u2019s reluctance to respond forcefully meant the Russians have not paid a heavy price for their actions, a decision that could prove critical in deterring future cyberattacks.The low-key approach of the F.B.I. meant that Russian hackers could roam freely through the committee\u2019s network for nearly seven months before top D.N.C. officials were alerted to the attack and hired cyberexperts to protect their systems. In the meantime, the hackers moved on to targets outside the D.N.C., including Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta, whose private email account was hacked months later.By last summer, Democrats watched in helpless fury as their private emails and confidential documents appeared online day after day \u2014 procured by Russian intelligence agents, posted on WikiLeaks and other websites, then eagerly reported on by the American media, including The Times. Mr. Trump gleefully cited many of the purloined emails on the campaign trail.In recent days, a skeptical president-elect, the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies and the two major parties have become embroiled in an extraordinary public dispute over what evidence exists that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia moved beyond mere espionage to deliberately try to subvert American democracy and pick the winner of the presidential election.Many of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s closest aides believe that the Russian assault had a profound impact on the election, while conceding that other factors \u2014 Mrs. Clinton\u2019s weaknesses as a candidate; her private email server; the public statements of the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, about her handling of classified information \u2014 were also important.While there\u2019s no way to be certain of the ultimate impact of the hack, this much is clear: A low-cost, high-impact weapon that Russia had test-fired in elections from Ukraine to Europe was trained on the United States, with devastating effectiveness. For Russia, with an enfeebled economy and a nuclear arsenal it cannot use short of all-out war, cyberpower proved the perfect weapon: cheap, hard to see coming, hard to trace.How U.S. intelligence officials have connected the Russian government to an attempt to disrupt the 2016 presidential election.\u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any doubt in anybody\u2019s mind,\u201d Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency and commander of United States Cyber Command, said at a postelection conference. \u201cThis was not something that was done casually, this was not something that was done by chance, this was not a target that was selected purely arbitrarily,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was a conscious effort by a nation-state to attempt to achieve a specific effect.\u201d\u201cIt was just a sucker punch to the gut every day,\u201d Ms. Tanden said. \u201cIt was the worst professional experience of my life.\u201dThe United States, too, has carried out cyberattacks, and in decades past the C.I.A. tried to subvert foreign elections. But the Russian attack is increasingly understood across the political spectrum as an ominous historic landmark \u2014 with one notable exception: Mr. Trump has rejected the findings of the intelligence agencies he will soon oversee as \u201cridiculous,\u201d insisting that the hacker may be American, or Chinese, but that \u201cthey have no idea.\u201dMr. Trump cited the reported disagreements between the agencies about whether Mr. Putin intended to help elect him. On Tuesday, a Russian government spokesman echoed Mr. Trump\u2019s scorn.\u201cThis tale of \u2018hacks\u2019 resembles a banal brawl between American security officials over spheres of influence,\u201d Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, wrote on Facebook.Over the weekend, four prominent senators \u2014 two Republicans and two Democrats \u2014 joined forces to pledge an investigation while pointedly ignoring Mr. Trump\u2019s skeptical claims.\u201cDemocrats and Republicans must work together, and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress, to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyberattacks,\u201d said Senators John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Chuck Schumer and Jack Reed.\u201cThis cannot become a partisan issue,\u201d they said. \u201cThe stakes are too high for our country.\u201dSitting in the basement of the Democratic National Committee headquarters, below a wall-size 2012 portrait of a smiling Barack Obama, is a 1960s-era filing cabinet missing the handle on the bottom drawer. Only a framed newspaper story hanging on the wall hints at the importance of this aged piece of office furniture.Andrew Brown, 37, the technology director at the D.N.C., was born after that famous break-in. But as he began to plan for this year\u2019s election cycle, he was well aware that the D.N.C. could become a break-in target again.There were aspirations to ensure that the D.N.C. was well protected against cyberintruders \u2014 and then there was the reality, Mr. Brown and his bosses at the organization acknowledged: The D.N.C. was a nonprofit group, dependent on donations, with a fraction of the security budget that a corporation its size would have.\u201cThere was never enough money to do everything we needed to do,\u201d Mr. Brown said.The D.N.C. had a standard email spam-filtering service, intended to block phishing attacks and malware created to resemble legitimate email. But when Russian hackers started in on the D.N.C., the committee did not have the most advanced systems in place to track suspicious traffic, internal D.N.C. memos show.\u201cThe F.B.I. thinks the D.N.C. has at least one compromised computer on its network and the F.B.I. wanted to know if the D.N.C. is aware, and if so, what the D.N.C. is doing about it,\u201d Mr. Tamene wrote in an internal memo about his contacts with the F.B.I. He added that \u201cthe Special Agent told me to look for a specific type of malware dubbed \u2018Dukes\u2019 by the U.S. intelligence community and in cybersecurity circles.\u201dPart of the problem was that Special Agent Hawkins did not show up in person at the D.N.C. Nor could he email anyone there, as that risked alerting the hackers that the F.B.I. knew they were in the system.Mr. Tamene\u2019s initial scan of the D.N.C. system \u2014 using his less-than-optimal tools and incomplete targeting information from the F.B.I. \u2014 found nothing. So when Special Agent Hawkins called repeatedly in October, leaving voice mail messages for Mr. Tamene, urging him to call back, \u201cI did not return his calls, as I had nothing to report,\u201d Mr. Tamene explained in his memo.In November, Special Agent Hawkins called with more ominous news. A D.N.C. computer was \u201ccalling home, where home meant Russia,\u201d Mr. Tamene\u2019s memo says, referring to software sending information to Moscow. \u201cSA Hawkins added that the F.B.I. thinks that this calling home behavior could be the result of a state-sponsored attack.\u201dMr. Brown knew that Mr. Tamene, who declined to comment, was fielding calls from the F.B.I. But he was tied up on a different problem: evidence suggesting that the campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s main Democratic opponent, had improperly gained access to her campaign data.Ms. Wasserman Schultz, then the D.N.C.\u2019s chairwoman, and Amy Dacey, then its chief executive, said in interviews that neither of them was notified about the early reports that the committee\u2019s system had likely been compromised.Shawn Henry, who once led the F.B.I.\u2019s cyber division and is now president of CrowdStrike Services, the cybersecurity firm retained by the D.N.C. in April, said he was baffled that the F.B.I. did not call a more senior official at the D.N.C. or send an agent in person to the party headquarters to try to force a more vigorous response.\u201cWe are not talking about an office that is in the middle of the woods of Montana,\u201d Mr. Henry said. \u201cWe are talking about an office that is half a mile from the F.B.I. office that is getting the notification.\u201d\u201cThis is not a mom-and-pop delicatessen or a local library. This is a critical piece of the U.S. infrastructure because it relates to our electoral process, our elected officials, our legislative process, our executive process,\u201d he added. \u201cTo me it is a high-level, serious issue, and if after a couple of months you don\u2019t see any results, somebody ought to raise that to a higher level.\u201dThe F.B.I. declined to comment on the agency\u2019s handling of the hack. \u201cThe F.B.I. takes very seriously any compromise of public and private sector systems,\u201d it said in a statement, adding that agents \u201cwill continue to share information\u201d to help targets \u201csafeguard their systems against the actions of persistent cybercriminals.\u201dBy March, Mr. Tamene and his team had met at least twice in person with the F.B.I. and concluded that Agent Hawkins was really a federal employee. But then the situation took a dire turn.A second team of Russian-affiliated hackers began to target the D.N.C. and other players in the political world, particularly Democrats. Billy Rinehart, a former D.N.C. regional field director who was then working for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign, got an odd email warning from Google.Mr. Rinehart was in Hawaii at the time. He remembers checking his email at 4 a.m. for messages from East Coast associates. Without thinking much about the notification, he clicked on the \u201cchange password\u201d button and half asleep, as best he can remember, he typed in a new password.What he did not know until months later is that he had just given the Russian hackers access to his email account.Hundreds of similar phishing emails were being sent to American political targets, including an identical email sent on March 19 to Mr. Podesta, chairman of the Clinton campaign. Given how many emails Mr. Podesta received through this personal email account, several aides also had access to it, and one of them noticed the warning email, sending it to a computer technician to make sure it was legitimate before anyone clicked on the \u201cchange password\u201d button.With another click, a decade of emails that Mr. Podesta maintained in his Gmail account \u2014 a total of about 60,000 \u2014 were unlocked for the Russian hackers. Mr. Delavan, in an interview, said that his bad advice was a result of a typo: He knew this was a phishing attack, as the campaign was getting dozens of them. He said he had meant to type that it was an \u201cillegitimate\u201d email, an error that he said has plagued him ever since.During this second wave, the hackers also gained access to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and then, through a virtual private network connection, to the main computer network of the D.N.C.The F.B.I. observed this surge of activity as well, again reaching out to Mr. Tamene to warn him. Yet Mr. Tamene still saw no reason to be alarmed: He found copies of the phishing emails in the D.N.C.\u2019s spam filter. But he had no reason, he said, to believe that the computer systems had been infiltrated.One bit of progress had finally been made by the middle of April: The D.N.C., seven months after it had first been warned, finally installed a \u201crobust set of monitoring tools,\u201d Mr. Tamene\u2019s internal memo says.The United States had two decades of warning that Russia\u2019s intelligence agencies were trying to break into America\u2019s most sensitive computer networks. But the Russians have always managed to stay a step ahead.Whole weapons designs were flowing out the door, and it was a first taste of what was to come: an escalating campaign of cyberattacks around the world.But for years, the Russians stayed largely out of the headlines, thanks to the Chinese \u2014 who took bigger risks, and often got caught. They stole the designs for the F-35 fighter jet, corporate secrets for rolling steel, even the blueprints for gas pipelines that supply much of the United States. And during the 2008 presidential election cycle, Chinese intelligence hacked into the campaigns of Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain, making off with internal position papers and communications. But they didn\u2019t publish any of it.The Russians were also quicker to turn their attacks to political purposes. A 2007 cyberattack on Estonia, a former Soviet republic that had joined NATO, sent a message that Russia could paralyze the country without invading it. The next year cyberattacks were used during Russia\u2019s war with Georgia.But American officials did not imagine that the Russians would dare try those techniques inside the United States. They were largely focused on preventing what former Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta warned was an approaching \u201ccyber Pearl Harbor\u201d \u2014 a shutdown of the power grid or cellphone networks.The Russians grew stealthier and stealthier, tricking government computers into sending out data while disguising the electronic \u201ccommand and control\u201d messages that set off alarms for anyone looking for malicious actions. The State Department was so crippled that it repeatedly closed its systems to throw out the intruders. At one point, officials traveling to Vienna with Secretary of State John Kerry for the Iran nuclear negotiations had to set up commercial Gmail accounts just to communicate with one another and with reporters traveling with them.Mr. Obama was briefed regularly on all this, but he made a decision that many in the White House now regret: He did not name Russians publicly, or issue sanctions. There was always a reason: fear of escalating a cyberwar, and concern that the United States needed Russia\u2019s cooperation in negotiations over Syria.\u201cWe\u2019d have all these circular meetings,\u201d one senior State Department official said, \u201cin which everyone agreed you had to push back at the Russians and push back hard. But it didn\u2019t happen.\u201dSo the Russians escalated again \u2014 breaking into systems not just for espionage, but to publish or broadcast what they found, known as \u201cdoxing\u201d in the cyberworld.Last year, the attacks became more aggressive. Russia hacked a major French television station, frying critical hardware. Around Christmas, it attacked part of the power grid in Ukraine, dropping a portion of the country into darkness, killing backup generators and taking control of generators. In retrospect, it was a warning shot.The attacks \u201cwere not fully integrated military operations,\u201d Mr. Sulmeyer said. But they showed an increasing boldness.The day before the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner in April, Ms. Dacey, the D.N.C.\u2019s chief executive, was preparing for a night of parties when she got an urgent phone call.With the new monitoring system in place, Mr. Tamene had examined administrative logs of the D.N.C.\u2019s computer system and found something very suspicious: An unauthorized person, with administrator-level security status, had gained access to the D.N.C.\u2019s computers.\u201cNot sure it is related to what the F.B.I. has been noticing,\u201d said one internal D.N.C. email sent on April 29. \u201cThe D.N.C. may have been hacked in a serious way this week, with password theft, etc.\u201d\u201cThree most important questions,\u201d Mr. Sussmann wrote to his clients the night the break-in was confirmed. \u201c1) What data was accessed? 2) How was it done? 3) How do we stop it?\u201dMr. Sussmann instructed his clients not to use D.N.C. email because they had just one opportunity to lock the hackers out \u2014 an effort that could be foiled if the hackers knew that the D.N.C. was on to them.\u201cYou only get one chance to raise the drawbridge,\u201d Mr. Sussmann said. \u201cIf the adversaries know you are aware of their presence, they will take steps to burrow in, or erase the logs that show they were present.\u201dThe work that such companies do is a computer version of old-fashioned crime scene investigation, with fingerprints, bullet casings and DNA swabs replaced by an electronic trail that can be just as incriminating. And just as police detectives learn to identify the telltale methods of a veteran burglar, so CrowdStrike investigators recognized the distinctive handiwork of Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear.Those are CrowdStrike\u2019s nicknames for the two Russian hacking groups that the firm found at work inside the D.N.C. network. Cozy Bear \u2014 the group also known as the Dukes or A.P.T. 29, for \u201cadvanced persistent threat\u201d \u2014 may or may not be associated with the F.S.B., the main successor to the Soviet-era K.G.B., but it is widely believed to be a Russian government operation. It made its first appearance in 2014, said Dmitri Alperovitch, CrowdStrike\u2019s co-founder and chief technology officer.It was Cozy Bear, CrowdStrike concluded, that first penetrated the D.N.C. in the summer of 2015, by sending spear-phishing emails to a long list of American government agencies, Washington nonprofits and government contractors. Whenever someone clicked on a phishing message, the Russians would enter the network, \u201cexfiltrate\u201d documents of interest and stockpile them for intelligence purposes.\u201cOnce they got into the D.N.C., they found the data valuable and decided to continue the operation,\u201d said Mr. Alperovitch, who was born in Russia and moved to the United States as a teenager.Only in March 2016 did Fancy Bear show up \u2014 first penetrating the computers of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and then jumping to the D.N.C., investigators believe. Fancy Bear, sometimes called A.P.T. 28 and believed to be directed by the G.R.U., Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, is an older outfit, tracked by Western investigators for nearly a decade. It was Fancy Bear that got hold of Mr. Podesta\u2019s email.Attribution, as the skill of identifying a cyberattacker is known, is more art than science. It is often impossible to name an attacker with absolute certainty. But over time, by accumulating a reference library of hacking techniques and targets, it is possible to spot repeat offenders. Fancy Bear, for instance, has gone after military and political targets in Ukraine and Georgia, and at NATO installations.That largely rules out cybercriminals and most countries, Mr. Alperovitch said. \u201cThere\u2019s no plausible actor that has an interest in all those victims other than Russia,\u201d he said. Another clue: The Russian hacking groups tended to be active during working hours in the Moscow time zone.To their astonishment, Mr. Alperovitch said, CrowdStrike experts found signs that the two Russian hacking groups had not coordinated their attacks. Fancy Bear, apparently not knowing that Cozy Bear had been rummaging in D.N.C. files for months, took many of the same documents.In the six weeks after CrowdStrike\u2019s arrival, in total secrecy, the computer system at the D.N.C. was replaced. For a weekend, email and phones were shut off; employees were told it was a system upgrade. All laptops were turned in and the hard drives wiped clean, with the uninfected information on them imaged to new drives.Though D.N.C. officials had learned that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had been infected, too, they did not notify their sister organization, which was in the same building, because they were afraid that it would leak.All of this work took place as the bitter contest for the Democratic nomination continued to play out between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders, and it was already causing a major distraction for Ms. Wasserman Schultz and the D.N.C.\u2019s chief executive.\u201cThis was not a bump in the road \u2014 bumps in the road happen all the time,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cTwo different Russian spy agencies had hacked into our network and stolen our property. And we did not yet know what they had taken. But we knew they had very broad access to our network. There was a tremendous amount of uncertainty. And it was chilling.\u201dThe D.N.C. executives and their lawyer had their first formal meeting with senior F.B.I. officials in mid-June, nine months after the bureau\u2019s first call to the tech-support contractor. Among the early requests at that meeting, according to participants: that the federal government make a quick \u201cattribution\u201d formally blaming actors with ties to Russian government for the attack to make clear that it was not routine hacking but foreign espionage.\u201cYou have a presidential election underway here and you know that the Russians have hacked into the D.N.C.,\u201d Mr. Sussmann said, recalling the message to the F.B.I. \u201cWe need to tell the American public that. And soon.\u201d\u201cAnd it\u2019s just a tiny part of all docs I downloaded from the Democrats networks,\u201d he wrote. Then something more ominous: \u201cThe main part of the papers, thousands of files and mails, I gave to WikiLeaks. They will publish them soon.\u201dIt was bad enough that Russian hackers had been spying inside the committee\u2019s network for months. Now the public release of documents had turned a conventional espionage operation into something far more menacing: political sabotage, an unpredictable, uncontrollable menace for Democratic campaigns.Guccifer 2.0 borrowed the moniker of an earlier hacker, a Romanian who called himself Guccifer and was jailed for breaking into the personal computers of former President George W. Bush, former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and other notables. This new attacker seemed intent on showing that the D.N.C.\u2019s cyberexperts at CrowdStrike were wrong to blame Russia. Guccifer 2.0 called himself a \u201clone hacker\u201d and mocked CrowdStrike for calling the attackers \u201csophisticated.\u201dBut online investigators quickly undercut his story. On a whim, Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai, a writer for Motherboard, the tech and culture site of Vice, tried to contact Guccifer 2.0 by direct message on Twitter.\u201cSurprisingly, he answered right away,\u201d Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai said. But whoever was on the other end seemed to be mocking him. \u201cI asked him why he did it, and he said he wanted to expose the Illuminati. He called himself a Gucci lover. And he said he was Romanian.\u201dThat gave Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai an idea. Using Google Translate, he sent the purported hacker some questions in Romanian. The answers came back in Romanian. But when he was offline, Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai checked with a couple of native speakers, who told him Guccifer 2.0 had apparently been using Google Translate as well \u2014 and was clearly not the Romanian he claimed to be.When Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai managed to engage Guccifer 2.0 over a period of weeks, he found that his interlocutor\u2019s tone and manner changed. \u201cAt first he was careless and colloquial. Weeks later, he was curt and more calculating,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seemed like a group of people, and a very sloppy attempt to cover up.\u201dThat was no shock; Mr. Sanders, after all, had been an independent socialist, not a Democrat, during his long career in Congress, while Mrs. Clinton had been one of the party\u2019s stars for decades. But the emails, some of them crude or insulting, infuriated Sanders delegates as they arrived in Philadelphia. Ms. Wasserman Schultz resigned under pressure on the eve of the convention where she had planned to preside.The Podesta emails were nowhere near as sensational as the Trump video. But, released by WikiLeaks day after day over the last month of the campaign, they provided material for countless news reports. They disclosed the contents of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s speeches to large banks, which she had refused to release. They exposed tensions inside the campaign, including disagreements over donations to the Clinton Foundation that staff members thought might look bad for the candidate and Ms. Tanden\u2019s complaint that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s instincts were \u201csuboptimal.\u201d\u201cI was just mortified,\u201d Ms. Tanden said in an interview. Her emails were released on the eve of one of the presidential debates, she recalled. \u201cI put my hands over my head and said, \u2018I can\u2019t believe this is happening to me.\u2019\u201d Though she had regularly appeared on television to support Mrs. Clinton, she canceled her appearances because all the questions were about what she had said in the emails.Ms. Tanden, like other Democrats whose messages became public, said it was obvious to her that WikiLeaks was trying its best to damage the Clinton campaign. \u201cIf you care about transparency, you put all the emails out at once,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they wanted to hurt her. So they put them out 1,800 to 3,000 a day.\u201dThe Trump campaign knew in advance about WikiLeaks\u2019 plans. Days before the Podesta email release began, Roger Stone, a Republican operative working with the Trump campaign, sent out an excited tweet about what was coming.But in an interview, Mr. Stone said he had no role in the leaks; he had just heard from an American with ties to WikiLeaks that damning emails were coming.Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder and editor, has resisted the conclusion that his site became a pass-through for Russian hackers working for Mr. Putin\u2019s government or that he was deliberately trying to undermine Mrs. Clinton\u2019s candidacy. But the evidence on both counts appears compelling.In a series of email exchanges, Mr. Assange refused to say anything about WikiLeaks\u2019 source for the hacked material. He denied that he had made his animus toward Mrs. Clinton clear in public statements (\u201cFalse. But what is this? Junior high?\u201d) or that the site had timed the releases for maximum negative effect on her campaign. \u201cWikiLeaks makes its decisions based on newsworthiness, including for its recent epic scoops,\u201d he wrote.Mr. Assange disputed the conclusion of the Oct. 7 statement from the intelligence agencies that the leaks were \u201cintended to interfere with the U.S. election process.\u201d\u201cThis is false,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs the disclosing party we know that this was not the intent. Publishers publishing newsworthy information during an election is part of a free election.\u201dBut asked whether he believed the leaks were one reason for Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Mr. Assange seemed happy to take credit. \u201cAmericans extensively engaged with our publications,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAccording to Facebook statistics WikiLeaks was the most referenced political topic during October.\u201dThough Mr. Assange did not say so, WikiLeaks\u2019 best defense may be the conduct of the mainstream American media. Every major publication, including The Times, published multiple stories citing the D.N.C. and Podesta emails posted by WikiLeaks, becoming a de facto instrument of Russian intelligence.Mr. Putin, a student of martial arts, had turned two institutions at the core of American democracy \u2014 political campaigns and independent media \u2014 to his own ends. The media\u2019s appetite for the hacked material, and its focus on the gossipy content instead of the Russian source, disturbed some of those whose personal emails were being reposted across the web.\u201cWhat was really surprising to me?\u201d Ms. Tanden said. \u201cI could not believe that reporters were covering it.\u201dInside the White House, as Mr. Obama\u2019s advisers debated their response, their conversation turned to North Korea.In late 2014, hackers working for Kim Jong-un, the North\u2019s young and unpredictable leader, had carried out a well-planned attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment intended to stop the Christmastime release of a comedy about a C.I.A. plot to kill Mr. Kim.But a formal \u201cattribution report\u201d still had not been forwarded to the president.\u201cIt took forever,\u201d one senior administration official said, complaining about the pace at which the intelligence assessments moved through the system.The assumption \u2014 still unproved \u2014 was that the code was put out in the open by the Russians as a warning: Retaliate for the D.N.C., and there are a lot more secrets, from the hackings of the State Department, the White House and the Pentagon, that might be spilled as well. One senior official compared it to the scene in \u201cThe Godfather\u201d where the head of a favorite horse is left in a bed, as a warning.The N.S.A. said nothing. But by late August, Admiral Rogers, its director, was pressing for a more muscular response to the Russians. In his role as director of the Pentagon\u2019s Cyber Command, he proposed a series of potential counter-cyberstrikes.While officials will not discuss them in detail, the possible counterstrikes reportedly included operations that would turn the tables on Mr. Putin, exposing his financial links to Russia\u2019s oligarchs, and punching holes in the Russian internet to allow dissidents to get their message out. Pentagon officials judged the measures too unsubtle and ordered up their own set of options.But in the end, none of those were formally presented to the president.\u201cIf we went to Defcon 4,\u201d one frequent participant in Ms. Haines\u2019s meetings said, using a phrase from the Cold War days of warnings of war, \u201cwe would be saying to the public that we didn\u2019t have confidence in the integrity of our voting system.\u201dEven something seemingly straightforward \u2014 using the president\u2019s executive powers, bolstered after the Sony incident, to place economic and travel sanctions on cyberattackers \u2014 seemed too risky.\u201cNo one was all that eager to impose costs before Election Day,\u201d said another participant in the classified meeting. \u201cAny retaliatory measures were seen through the prism of what would happen on Election Day.\u201dInstead, when Mr. Obama\u2019s national security team reconvened after summer vacation, the focus turned to a crash effort to secure the nation\u2019s voting machines and voter-registration rolls from hacking. The scenario they discussed most frequently \u2014 one that turned out not to be an issue \u2014 was a narrow vote in favor of Mrs. Clinton, followed by a declaration by Mr. Trump that the vote was \u201crigged\u201d and more leaks intended to undercut her legitimacy.Donna Brazile, the interim chairwoman of the D.N.C., became increasingly frustrated as the clock continued to run down on the presidential election \u2014 and still there was no broad public condemnation by the White House, or Republican Party leaders, of the attack as an act of foreign espionage.\u201cWe just kept hearing the government would respond, the government would respond,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce upon a time, if a foreign government interfered with our election we would respond as a nation, not as a political party.\u201dBut Mr. Obama did decide that he would deliver a warning to Mr. Putin in person at a Group of 20 summit meeting in Hangzhou, China, the last time they would be in the same place while Mr. Obama was still in office. When the two men met for a tense pull-aside, Mr. Obama explicitly warned Mr. Putin of a strong American response if there was continued effort to influence the election or manipulate the vote, according to White House officials who were not present for the one-on-one meeting.Later that day, Mr. Obama made a rare reference to America\u2019s own offensive cybercapacity, which he has almost never talked about. \u201cFrankly, both offensively and defensively, we have more capacity,\u201d he told reporters.But when it came time to make a public assertion of Russia\u2019s role in early October, it was made in a written statement from the director of national intelligence and the secretary of homeland security. It was far less dramatic than the president\u2019s appearance in the press room two years before to directly accuse the North Koreans of attacking Sony.The reference in the statement to hackings on \u201cpolitical organizations,\u201d officials now say, encompassed a hacking on data stored by the Republicans as well. Two senior officials say the forensic evidence was accompanied by \u201chuman and technical\u201d sources in Russia, which appears to mean that the United States\u2019 implants or taps in Russian computer and phone networks helped confirm the country\u2019s role.But that may not be known for decades, until the secrets are declassified.A week later Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was sent out to transmit a public warning to Mr. Putin: The United States will retaliate \u201cat the time of our choosing. And under the circumstances that have the greatest impact.\u201dLater, after Mr. Biden said he was not concerned that Russia could \u201cfundamentally alter the election,\u201d he was asked whether the American public would know if the message to Mr. Putin had been sent.\u201cHope not,\u201d Mr. Biden responded.Some of his former colleagues think that was the wrong answer. An American counterstrike, said Michael Morell, the former deputy director of the C.I.A. under Mr. Obama, has \u201cgot to be overt. It needs to be seen.\u201dA covert response would significantly limit the deterrence effect, he added. \u201cIf you can\u2019t see it, it\u2019s not going to deter the Chinese and North Koreans and Iranians and others.\u201dThe Obama administration says it still has more than 30 days to do exactly that.As the year draws to a close, it now seems possible that there will be multiple investigations of the Russian hacking \u2014 the intelligence review Mr. Obama has ordered completed by Jan. 20, the day he leaves office, and one or more congressional inquiries.

{"Headline": "A Call-Up\u2019s Story: Years in the Minors, Four Days in the N.H.L.", "Date": "2016-12-21", "News": "Supported byBUFFALO \u2014 Erik Burgdoerfer was two rungs below the N.H.L., riding buses from Bakersfield, Calif., to Boise, Idaho, and spending the night in Econo Lodge hotels as the Bakersfield Condors slid further down the ECHL standings. This was three seasons ago, when Burgdoerfer played defense for the Condors and the team was off to a 1-10-0-1 start.His coach, Troy Mann, had given up a job as an assistant for the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League. Mann\u2019s assistant Ryan Murphy had left a career in finance to return to hockey\u2019s minor leagues.Burgdoerfer, a 6-foot-2, 210-pounder who was undrafted out of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, was about to turn 25, a time when, he said, \u201cthere\u2019s a little saying: \u2018You turn from a prospect to suspect.\u2019\u201dLast week, days after turning 28, Burgdoerfer said, \u201cThose are the times when you\u2019re playing AA, two leagues away from where you want to be, and you\u2019ve got to really work.\u201dFor four days this month, Burgdoerfer was where he wanted to be.He made his N.H.L. debut for the Buffalo Sabres in a 3-2 overtime loss to the Washington Capitals on Dec. 5. After setbacks, doubts and 429 regular-season games in the minor leagues, in places like Bakersfield; Oklahoma City; and Charleston, S.C., Burgdoerfer had finally gotten an N.H.L. call-up. He averaged 11 minutes 10 seconds of ice time and had no penalties over two games, including a 4-3 overtime win over the Edmonton Oilers on Dec. 6.Two days later, with two defensemen returning from injury, Buffalo returned him to the Rochester Americans of the A.H.L.Burgdoerfer was not nearly the oldest player to make his N.H.L. debut. Connie Madigan, who was known as Mad Dog and had a cameo in the cult hockey film \u201cSlap Shot,\u201d was a 38-year-old journeyman defenseman when he joined the St. Louis Blues during the 1972-73 season. On Tuesday, Pat Cannone made his N.H.L. debut at age 30 with the Minnesota Wild.But in a league that is trending younger and in which teams increasingly rebuild through the draft, \u201canybody 26, 27 to see their debuts is highly unlikely, even though he\u2019s still a young man at 27 years old,\u201d Mann, Burgdoerfer\u2019s coach with Bakersfield, said.Although Burgdoerfer\u2019s time in the N.H.L. was brief and mostly unremarkable, Sabres Coach Dan Bylsma said he had served as a lesson in determination and resilience for prospects in the organization. And Burgdoerfer\u2019s story \u2014 a common one in hockey, current and former teammates said \u2014 epitomizes the challenges of making it: how for all but the most celebrated prospects, getting a crack at the N.H.L. involves an odyssey.Bylsma was 25 when he made his N.H.L. debut in 1995 as a Los Angeles Kings right wing after 200 games in the minors. He said he identified with Burgdoerfer \u201creally closely.\u201d\u201cI think that\u2019s a great story, a story of the dues and the price you do have to pay to play our game at the highest level,\u201d Bylsma said.For two games, at least, Burgdoerfer body-checked N.H.L. opponents and was spell-checked by sportswriters. He met the Sabres in Washington, where a car was waiting at the airport to take him to the Ritz-Carlton. He learned the nuances of N.H.L. play.\u201cIt\u2019s more of a cerebral game,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have more time with the puck, but you have to make the right play. Any mistakes that are made are definitely amplified.\u201dHe learned about himself.\u201cYou\u2019ve worked all these years to say you\u2019ve played in the N.H.L.,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s switched to now I want to be a full-time N.H.L. player.\u201dHe learned from a fan that \u201cBurgdoerfer,\u201d in German, can mean \u201cmountain village dweller.\u201dBurgdoerfer grew up in East Setauket on Long Island. He arrived at Rensselaer at 17, and even in his junior season worried about being scratched from the lineup.\u201cI think my road helped me learn and value day-to-day competition, fighting for your job, fighting for your dream,\u201d he said.After graduating with a degree in business, he gave himself three seasons to make it in the pros, taking internships in New York during summers to keep his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 fresh. In his fourth season, he met Mann, who persuaded Burgdoerfer to stick around Bakersfield for another year.\u201cOne of the things I told Burgy from my experience,\u201d said Mann, who spent 11 seasons playing in the minors for 15 teams and never got an N.H.L. call-up, \u201cmaybe I held on a little too long, but people around me kept saying, \u2018If you\u2019re making an O.K. living, enjoying yourself and still have passion to play, just play till you really don\u2019t feel you\u2019re good enough to play anymore because there\u2019s a lifetime of something else after that.\u2019\u201dFor Mann, who had a degree in education from the University of Toronto to fall back on, the next phase meant coaching.After the brutal start to their first season together in Bakersfield, Mann called an emergency meeting. The Condors completed a turnaround, qualifying for the conference finals.With winning came advancement. The next season, Mann was hired as the coach of Hershey, of the A.H.L., and he invited Burgdoerfer to training camp, where he earned a contract.\u201cI think the biggest thing with guys like Burgy is high character, and his work ethic was tremendous,\u201d Mann said. \u201cHe had the size and pretty good skill for a stay-at-home defenseman.\u201dLast season, the Bears qualified for the Calder Cup finals, the A.H.L.\u2019s championship round, in which they were swept by the Lake Erie Monsters. Again, winning helped Burgdoerfer get a contract, this time a deal with the Sabres.Burgdoerfer\u2019s promotion offered another lesson for Mann.The Bears are 3 points out of first place in the A.H.L.\u2019s Eastern Conference, and Mann is 47, below the average age of an N.H.L. head coach.\u201cHopefully myself being one of those guys who haven\u2019t given up over the years, in terms of battling it out at the lower levels and coaching here in Hershey,\u201d Mann said, \u201cand hopefully the N.H.L. is to come in the not-too-distant future.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The resulting company originally sold cybersecurity software, but it has since broadened its offerings to provide security consulting services.Optiv, which had $947.3 million in revenue in 2015, filed confidentially for an initial public offering last year and revealed the plans last month.

{"Headline": "Now That Italy Has Rejected Constitutional Amendments, What\u2019s Next?", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byProponents of the changes, including Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, said they would streamline Italy\u2019s cumbersome legislative process by eliminating two-thirds of the Senate and stripping regions of power over crucial issues like transportation, energy and infrastructure.Critics, which included populist groups, said the proposals would have concentrated too much power in the hands of government.The vote was widely considered a referendum on Mr. Renzi\u2019s nearly three-year-old government, although some voters were genuinely displeased with the proposed changes.The most contentious proposal deals with changes to the Senate, which would have become a mostly consultative body consisting of regional and municipal officials.But many constitutional experts wanted to preserve the existing authority of the Senate as a check on the government.The prime minister\u2019s resignation was necessary because he had staked his political future on the referendum. He repeatedly stated that he was in politics to affect change, not to \u201ckeep a chair warm.\u201d When the changes he wanted were rejected, he kept his promise to quit.Mr. Renzi may be leaving the political arena, but Sergio Fabbrini, director of the Luiss School of Government in Rome, predicted that he would not be absent for long.\u201cDefeat for Renzi does not mean defeat in the long term,\u201d he said, noting that those who backed the referendum changes \u2014 about 40 percent of voters \u2014 formed what he described as a \u201cparty of the nation,\u201d which backed Mr. Renzi, who nonetheless faces a fight to maintain control of the Democratic Party.\u201cIt is a movement with a clear leader, a clear program and a clear European outlook,\u201d Mr. Fabbrini said. The opponents of the changes, on the other hand, were a motley array of parties and movements that shared a sovereign, Euroskeptic and anti-globalization vision, but perhaps little else.\u201cApparently Mr. Renzi lost the battle, but the war is still to be fought,\u201d he said.In the short term, the budget must be passed and the electoral law must be modified or completely overhauled. Mr. Mattarella might appoint a caretaker government to remain in power until elections in the spring. Or he might try to negotiate a longer-term solution, with elections in 2018, when the legislature is scheduled to end.Antonio Polito, deputy director of the Milan-based daily Corriere della Sera, said three people are in position to head a caretaker government: Pier Carlo Padoan, Italy\u2019s finance minister (\u201cwidely respected in Europe\u201d); Pietro Grasso, Senate president (an institutional choice); and Dario Franceschini, culture minister (a Democratic Party heavyweight).Yes, because Italy\u2019s electoral law, the so-called Italicum, which was approved in 2015, is under review by the constitutional court.The law calls for a two-round system, which gives the winning party a majority bonus, but the law applies only to the Lower House, and not to the Senate (which the referendum was supposed to partly eliminate).The law gives the winning party a significant majority, meaning that barring internal tussles, the winning party could rule for an entire five-year term, which is unusual in Italy.As a result, many parties oppose the law. The populist Five Star Movement was among them, but it now wants the law to stand because it is performing strongly in the polls.The \u201cNo\u201d vote has opened a period of economic and political uncertainty in Italy and in Europe, each feeding into the other.Financially, although the markets were relatively calm on Monday, there is concern about the long-term economic consequences of the referendum.The Five Star Movement has pledged to carry out a referendum on whether Italy should remain in the eurozone if it comes to power, potentially undermining the single currency\u2019s stability and that of the wider European Union.Now that Mr. Renzi is leaving, financial analysts worry that the bank rescue efforts will collapse. That would turn away desperately needed private investors and lead to a renewed and possibly contagious financial crisis in Europe, where banks and financial institutions continually lend money to one another.Troubles in the banking sector weigh heavily on the wider Italian economy and could create a vicious circle if economic stagnation continues.If more businesses and consumers struggle to pay their debts, the number of bad loans could rise further and make it even more difficult for banks to provide the credit businesses need to expand or invest.The market interest rate, or yield, on Italian 10-year government bonds has nearly doubled since August, to more than 2 percent, a sign that investors are worried and consider the bonds to be increasingly risky.Populist forces in Italy share a common anti-European sentiment with their continental counterparts, but they are more heterogeneous and have a longer history than elsewhere in Europe.The Northern League has been riding the populist wave for more than two decades on a right-wing, anti-immigration and protectionist platform.The Five Star Movement, which recently won mayoral elections in Rome and Turin, is an internet-based group that draws support from a much broader political spectrum.It aims to sweep away Italy\u2019s elites from positions of power and replace them with regular citizens, and has repeatedly called for a referendum on whether Italy should leave the eurozone. It is loath to make political compromises, refusing to participate in coalition governments.Elisabetta Povoledo and Gaia Pianigiani reported from Rome, and Aurelien Breeden from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Avoidable Crash in Car Loans", "Date": "2016-12-21", "News": "Supported byEditorialIf successful, they will enfeeble an agency that has proved its worth time and again. In the past five years, the bureau has forced lenders to provide $11.7 billion in restitution and relief to 27 million consumers for illegal practices involving mortgages, foreclosures, credit cards, student loans, payday loans and other forms of credit.What can the consumer bureau do? The answer is, not much, and that is a big reason subprime auto lending is so troubling. Congress gave the bureau authority over banks and nonbank finance companies. But it did not give the agency authority over auto dealers. Auto dealers, who tend to be prominent constituents in most congressional districts, lobbied successfully to be exempted from regulation by the bureau. That special treatment has meant relatively weak oversight of auto lending, because many auto loans, though financed by regulated lenders, are arranged by dealers, who often have discretion over most loan terms.A bust in subprime auto lending, when it happens, won\u2019t shatter the economy as the mortgage bust did. But it will harm millions of Americans. More and better financial oversight could help to avoid this outcome, but Congress is intent on moving in the opposite direction.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Leonard B. Sand, Judge in Landmark Yonkers Segregation Case, Dies at 88", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byLeonard B. Sand, a federal judge in New York who presided over a 27-year landmark case in which he found that city officials in Yonkers had intentionally segregated public housing and schools along racial lines, died on Saturday at his home in Sleepy Hollow, N.Y. He was 88.His death was confirmed by his son David.The Yonkers case, which received national attention, was hardly the only lawsuit in which local governments in the Northeast had been charged with racial discrimination, but it was one of the most bitterly contested.The charges against Yonkers were brought in a lawsuit that the Justice Department filed in 1980 in Federal District Court in Manhattan. The case was assigned to Judge Sand, who had joined the court two years earlier.Though Judge Sand presided over other prominent cases in his long judicial tenure, including terrorism and financial fraud cases, the marathon Yonkers litigation loomed largest in defining his public image.Or images.Some applauded him as rightly following precedents when, in 1986, he ordered that the city remedy the housing portion of its violations by adopting a plan for building up to 1,000 units of low- and moderate-income housing in predominantly white neighborhoods.They praised him again when he imposed potentially bankrupting fines on Yonkers to overcome its City Council\u2019s repeated defiance of his mandated remedy.One coalition of civil rights and religious groups cited \u201chis courageous effort to enforce the rule of law in Yonkers.\u201dCritics, however, viewed him as engaging in \u201csocial engineering,\u201d and some called him a \u201cjudicial tyrant.\u201d Yonkers officials, who denied they were responsible for the segregation, denounced the judge, as did many white residents, some of whom picketed his weekend home in northern Westchester County.The clash of wills was dramatized last year in the HBO mini-series \u201cShow Me a Hero,\u201d based on the book of the same title by Lisa Belkin, a former reporter for The New York Times. Bob Balaban portrayed Judge Sand.Judge Sand, who had a reputation as soft-spoken and patient on the bench, said in an interview with The Times in 1988: \u201cI like to think I have a reasonable perspective on what a judge\u2019s role is in our society. I don\u2019t let it get under my skin. I have a job to do. I think I know what that job is. I find my work satisfying.\u201dHe had been in private law practice in New York City for nearly 20 years when President Jimmy Carter nominated him for the federal court in Manhattan in 1978. After the Justice Department filed its lawsuit against Yonkers \u2014 the N.A.A.C.P. joined as a plaintiff later \u2014 the judge tried over the next three and a half years to get the parties to reach a settlement, but the effort failed.After conducting a trial, he ruled in 1985 that \u201cthe extreme concentration of subsidized housing that exists in southwest Yonkers today is the result of a pattern and practice of racial discrimination by city officials, pursued in response to constituent pressures to select or support only sites that would preserve existing patterns of racial segregation.\u201dThat pattern, he said, had contributed over three decades to the 1980 census finding that 80 percent of the city\u2019s minority-group population lived in southwest Yonkers. And, he said, it contributed to a segregated school system in which minority students attended \u201cgenerally inferior facilities\u201d that provided a lesser \u201cquality of educational opportunity.\u201dThe school desegregation program he ordered, including academically enriched magnet schools and busing, was quickly put into effect.But his housing order was fought for two years by what he called \u201cobstructive and dilatory tactics,\u201d and in August 1988 he imposed the fines: $100 the first day, doubling each subsequent day. Within a month they would total more than the city\u2019s annual budget, $337 million.An appeals court capped the fines at $1 million a day, but they would still be crippling, and in September the City Council voted to accept the order when two of the defiant Council members reversed their previous votes. But with further litigation over financing and sites, the last of the required housing was not completed \u2014 and the case not concluded \u2014 until 2007.Other widely noted decisions by Judge Sand included a 1990 ruling that overturned a ban on panhandling in the New York City subway system. It was the first time a federal court found that panhandling was a free-speech right protected by the First Amendment.\u201cA true test of one\u2019s commitment to constitutional principles is the extent to which recognition is given to the rights of those in our midst who are the least affluent, least powerful and least welcome,\u201d Judge Sand wrote.Though Judge Sand said the begging could be restricted by keeping it out of the subway cars, an appeals court reversed his ruling and kept the systemwide ban intact.Judge Sand was one of the authors of \u201cModern Federal Jury Instructions,\u201d which since its publication three decades ago has become a leading treatise in federal courts on what judges should tell juries about the law before they begin to deliberate.Leonard Burke Solomon was born in the Bronx on May 24, 1928. His father, Frank Solomon, was a textile manufacturer, and his mother, the former Dora Sado, was involved in the business. He changed his name to Sand as a young man.He graduated from New York University and, in 1951, from Harvard Law School. In 1952 he was a clerk to Judge Irving R. Kaufman, who gained national attention a year earlier when he sentenced Julius and Ethel Rosenberg to the electric chair.In the 1950s Mr. Sand was an assistant United States attorney in Manhattan and an assistant to the United States solicitor general. In 1955, he married Ann Sulzberger, a first cousin of Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the former publisher of The Times.Besides his son David, his immediate survivors include his wife; another son, Robert; a daughter, Peggy Sand; and six grandchildren.Perhaps Judge Sand\u2019s most prominent criminal trial was that in 2001 of four terrorists who were convicted of conspiring in the 1998 bombings of two American embassies in East Africa, which killed 224 people. Two defendants then faced a death penalty hearing, which resulted in life sentences after the jury could not agree on imposing a death sentence.Daniel L. Stein, a former law clerk to Judge Sand, said the judge recalled years later that in a special verdict form, some jurors noted that the terrorists \u201cwere suicide bombers, so why give them what they want?\u201dMr. Stein said Judge Sand told him: \u201cJuries get it right. There\u2019s a lot of wisdom in a well-instructed jury.\u201dBenjamin Weiser contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lagarde Case Is \u2018Weak,\u2019 French Prosecutor Says, Raising Chances of Acquittal", "Date": "2016-12-15", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 The prosecutor in the trial against Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, raised the chance that she would be acquitted of criminal charges linked to the misuse of public funds, after he called the case \u201cvery weak\u201d on Thursday.Ms. Lagarde stands accused of \u201cnegligence by a person in a position of public authority,\u201d in a matter related to her time as French finance minister. The case stems from an arbitration hearing ordered by Ms. Lagarde that ultimately awarded a French tycoon more than 400 million euros, or $425 million.She has long dismissed the allegations \u2014 which have dogged her for nearly a decade \u2014 as politically motivated and without basis. But they have nevertheless captured the attention of the public, illustrating close ties between France\u2019s powerful politicians and the country\u2019s business elite.Wrapping up a four-day trial, Jean-Claude Marin, the public prosecutor, said the testimony presented did not appear to be sufficient to merit a conviction. It is a theme prosecutors have echoed previously.The case was halted in September 2015, when France\u2019s top prosecutor said there was insufficient evidence. But a special court, which had been set up in 1993 to hear cases against the country\u2019s politicians, overrode that recommendation.Ms. Lagarde, a former senior lawyer and executive with the international law firm Baker & McKenzie, has taken time to defend herself in person, while remaining at the helm of the I.M.F. The Washington-based I.M.F. has said that while the case was a private matter, it retained confidence in her.The case against Ms. Lagarde centers on Bernard Tapie, a former entertainer-turned-Adidas executive who has previously been jailed on corruption charges. Mr. Tapie had accused Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais of cheating him out of money when he sold his stake in the sportswear company in 1993. At the time, the bank was still partially owned by the French state.Years of legal battles ensued, with Ms. Lagarde eventually sending the dispute to a private arbitration authority in 2007. The three-person panel awarded Mr. Tapie damages and interest to be paid by the government, a ruling that angered the French public.Ms. Lagarde\u2019s aides suggested she annul the decision. But she declined to do so because it could result in a slew of new lawsuits from Mr. Tapie and further costs to the state.After the ruling, questions emerged about the impartiality of one of the arbiters. That arbiter, Pierre Estoup, was accused of having ties to Mr. Tapie\u2019s lawyer. The lawyer and Mr. Estoup are now expected to stand trial in France over whether they colluded during the arbitration proceedings.The payout itself has since been annulled, with Mr. Tapie ordered to repay \u20ac404 million with interest to the state. He is, however, currently under bankruptcy protection and has not yet repaid the sum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Currency Didn\u2019t Really Drop, Despite Jitters Over Trump", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported bySinosphereHONG KONG \u2014 Donald J. Trump has irritated China even before taking office as president, with criticism of the country\u2019s trade and currency practices and an unexpected phone call with the president of Taiwan.For a few hours on Tuesday, it looked to some as if China had struck back.Data services widely available to the public showed that the country\u2019s currency, the renminbi, had been sharply devalued as China slept.Such a move would roil global markets and drastically escalate economic tensions between Beijing and the incoming administration. And because China tightly controls the value of its currency, such a sharp and sudden move would be no accident.But no deliberate devaluation took place. Instead, the culprit was a technical problem.Concerns are already high that slowing economic growth and persistent capital outflows are putting pressure on Beijing to let its currency weaken.The renminbi mainly trades onshore in China during normal business hours \u2014 and it does not trade overnight, when the supposedly big devaluation took place.A basic Google search \u2014 and data published by XE.com, one of the world\u2019s most popular currency websites \u2014 appeared to show early Tuesday that the renminbi had suddenly fallen more than 8 percent.Both Google Finance and XE appear to have used erroneous data. It was unclear what pricing sources were in play, but on Monday, ICAP, a foreign currency broker based in London, published errant quotes for renminbi-to-dollar exchange rates.Detailed price data carried by Bloomberg and Reuters showed ICAP on Tuesday morning as quoting the renminbi at higher than 7.4 per dollar. The actual market rate at the time was about 6.86 per dollar.A sudden drop in the Chinese currency\u2019s value seems to have been caused by a technical issue, not manipulation.\u201cNot a tradable price,\u201d said Stephen Innes, a senior currency trader at Oanda in Singapore, said of the conspicuously weak renminbi rate. \u201cIt looks like little more than an error.\u201d\u201cWe have a wide array of upstream data sources, several of which provided rates which our algorithms interpreted as a genuine movement\u201d in the renminbi, XE said in a statement. \u201cWe have confirmed with our upstream providers that these were inaccurate and have adjusted our rates accordingly.\u201dGoogle declined to comment, and ICAP did not respond to requests for comment.The related rates for offshore renminbi, which trades around the clock, were unfazed on Tuesday.Mr. Trump took to Twitter on Sunday to reiterate his criticism of Beijing\u2019s currency policy, saying: \u201cDid China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency?\u201dHours later, the seemingly sudden drop in the renminbi appeared to some like a direct retaliation.Mr. Balding cited the downward pressures that have been building on the Chinese currency in the face of outflows, as citizens and companies rush to get their renminbi offshore and convert it into more international currencies, like the dollar.\u201cTrump just exacerbates all these things, raising the nervousness of an already jittery situation,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

This is the final volume in an ambitious and imaginative trilogy of city atlases edited by Rebecca Solnit, this time with the assistance of Joshua Jelly-Schapiro. As in \u201cInfinite City,\u201d an exploration of San Francisco, and the New Orleans-focused \u201cUnfathomable City,\u201d the work intersperses 26 beautifully rendered maps with essays that attempt to grapple with New York as it is, was and imagines itself to be.This is an impossible task, of course. But it\u2019s exciting to watch smart people attempt the impossible. The editors have assembled a remarkable team of artists, geographers and thinkers. There\u2019s Luc Sante on experiencing \u201criots, Sharifa Rhodes-Pitts on gentrification, Astra Taylor on the Occupy movement, Francisco Goldman on the Red Hook neighborhood of Brooklyn. All these descriptors are inadequate; none of these essays can be quite so easily pinned down, delving as they do into the personal, the collective, the political.The maps themselves are things of beauty. \u201cCapital of Capital\u201d views the city as financial engine; \u201cBrooklyn Villages\u201d gives us Kings County as a collection of micro-communities swept in history\u2019s wake. \u201cWhat Is a Jew? From Emma Goldman to Goldman Sachs\u201d is an idiosyncratic exploration of ethnic identity. Elsewhere, there\u2019s \u201cHarper\u2019s and Harpooners: Whaling and Publishing in Melville\u2019s Manhattan\u201d and \u201cMysterious Land of Shaolin: The Wu-Tang Clan\u2019s Staten Island.\u201d \u201cSinging the City: The New York of Dreams\u201d charts the boroughs from the Bronx (Man Parrish) to Queens (the Ramones), and incidentally makes for a dynamic playlist.The designer Lia Tjandra has overseen the creation of an extraordinary series of documents that demand an unapologetic level of attention and engagement. As Solnit rightly says in her introduction, \u201cmaps demand work, and this kind of cerebral work can be exhilarating.\u201d (This does, it\u2019s true, render it all the more frustrating when a center portion of some of the maps is obscured by the book\u2019s well.)If the title conveys not just vitality but an ominous inevitability, that\u2019s surely no accident. This is a work that, like its predecessors, isn\u2019t in the business of rosy nostalgia: The trilogy as a whole grapples with what Solnit terms urban domination \u201cin the colonial sense,\u201d along with the fact that our cities have been marked, scarred and built by tragic history. To say that the editors have a point of view is to understate the case. Indeed, what they\u2019ve embarked on can only be called an act of radical curation. Solnit, an accomplished and influential thinker, tackles her subject with characteristic frankness and pugnacity. From the book\u2019s first pages, there\u2019s no doubt about her impassioned rage at the grinding wheels of hypergentrification and the resulting blows to diversity and culture.She also addresses New York\u2019s infuriating sense of self-importance. In her introduction, Solnit\u2019s evident irritation at the city\u2019s smug provincialism is in conflict with her need to acknowledge its place in our collective sense of self. To discuss New York\u2019s decline as an art power, a center of finance, a beacon of enlightened culture, one must first acknowledge and dissect the mythology, itself a sort of tribute. Also, as should be clear to everyone by now, New York doesn\u2019t admit to the concept of bad publicity.This directness feels necessary; you can\u2019t have a Virgil who doesn\u2019t know his way around. The book\u2019s tone winds up being less revisionist than matter-of-fact, although at times the necessity of stripping away centuries of nostalgia-fueled lore results in a hectoring didacticism that credits the reader with neither curiosity nor wisdom. But whether or not you bridle at being educated, you will learn \u2014 from, say, the \u201cMother Tongues and Queens\u201d map (compiled with the Endangered Language Alliance) or a map that acts as a comprehensive guide to the city\u2019s history of riots. When Garnette Cadogan describes the pleasures of being a walker in the city, or Alexandra T. Vazquez offers an ode to the D.J. Alex Sensation, you may feel not only piqued, intrigued and angered but moved.When you\u2019re dealing with the close quarters demanded by first-person narration, it\u2019s inevitable that you won\u2019t warm to all your interlocutors equally. That\u2019s a city for you. The irony is that the scale of any metropolis, and perhaps especially New York, is often most easily captured by a single voice. What might be called the canonical New York texts \u2014 by Jane Jacobs, E.B. White, Joseph Mitchell, Vivian Gornick \u2014 tend to succeed largely because of the consistent point of view of one speaker. To try to capture a city\u2019s scope through the more literal means of maps and facts winds up diminishing its monumentality by hinting at what can\u2019t be done.You won\u2019t close \u201cNonstop Metropolis\u201d feeling as if you\u2019ve gotten a handle on New York, any more than the prior two books provided definitive portraits of San Francisco and New Orleans. Then again, I don\u2019t imagine that\u2019s what its creators would want. \u201cNonstop Metropolis\u201d is a document of its time, of our time. In her introduction, Solnit suggests that in some respects the earlier atlases in the trilogy are already dated. This is as it should be. However much this book forces us to grapple with our past and our present, it also raises larger questions about our future \u2014 questions of identity and, in the end, emotional attachment. \u201cNonstop Metropolis\u201d riffs on Milton Glaser\u2019s famed \u201cI Love New York\u201d logo by adorning its cover with a mammoth human heart, the work of the book\u2019s principal artist, Alison Pebworth. This was, I think, not done ironically. Love doesn\u2019t always involve prizing, idealizing or cherishing. On the contrary.A review on Dec. 11 about \u201cNonstop Metropolis: A New York City Atlas,\u201d edited by Rebecca Solnit and Joshua Jelly-Schapiro, misidentified the designer who oversaw the creation of the atlas\u2019s maps and brought them to completion. She is Lia Tjandra \u2014 not the book\u2019s principal artist, Alison Pebworth, who contributed the cover logo and title page artwork.Sadie Stein is a contributing editor at The Paris Review.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Evangelical Scion Who Stopped Believing", "Date": "2016-12-29", "News": "FeatureThe son of a famous pastor, Bart Campolo is now a rising star of atheism \u2014 using the skills he learned in the world he left behind.Supported byNormally his bike rides were his time to think \u2014 about his family, his ministry and his increasingly complex relationship with his Christian faith. But he has no memory of his thoughts that day. He left the house, and the next thing he remembers is waking up in the hospital. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t remember anything else,\u201d he says.He was later able to piece together bits of what happened. There were skid marks on the hill where he was found, and these suggested he had crossed a lane of traffic. The speedometer he was wearing recorded his velocity at that moment: 40 miles per hour. His helmet was cracked in four spots, and his bicycle had been left, undamaged, on the side of the road. It seems he hit a patch of soft dirt and flew headfirst into a tree. A fellow cyclist found him wandering in the middle of the road. When he got to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, a doctor asked him who was president. He said George Bush \u2014 meaning the father, not the son.For most of his life, Campolo had gone from success to success. His father, Tony, was one of the most important evangelical Christian preachers of the last 50 years, a prolific author and an erstwhile spiritual adviser to Bill Clinton. The younger Campolo had developed a reputation of his own, running successful inner-city missions in Philadelphia and Ohio and traveling widely as a guest preacher. An extreme extrovert, he was brilliant before a crowd and also at ease in private conversations, connecting with everyone from country-club suburbanites to the destitute souls he often fed in his own house. He was a role model for younger Christians looking to move beyond the culture wars over abortion or homosexuality and get back to Jesus\u2019 original teachings. Now, lying in a hospital bed, he wasn\u2019t sure what he believed any more.For weeks, he cried constantly. He had lost whole patches of memory. When he finally healed, after about a month, he had a thought about life \u2014 or, rather, the afterlife. The thought was: There is no afterlife. \u201cAfter the bike crash,\u201d Campolo says, \u201cI was like, \u2018A, this is it, and B, you don\u2019t know how much of it you\u2019ve got.\u2019\u2009\u201dThough Marty, his wife, had long entertained doubts about Christianity, Campolo had always done his job and, in his words, \u201cbrought her back.\u201d But the truth was, he had been breaking up with God for a long time. \u201cWhen I took off on the bicycle that day,\u201d Campolo says, \u201cthe supernaturalism in my faith was dialed so far down you could barely notice it.\u201d It had been years since he made God or Jesus or the resurrection the centerpiece of the frequent fellowship dinners he and Marty hosted. Talk instead was always about love and friendship. In 2004, he performed a wedding for two close lesbian friends, and in 2006, he began teaching that everybody could be saved, that nobody would go to hell. To evangelicals, he already sounded more like a Unitarian Universalist than like any of them.Now, after his near-death experience, his wife told him \u2014 more bluntly than she ever had \u2014 what she thought was going on. \u201cYou know,\u201d Marty said, \u201cI think you ought to stop being a professional Christian, since you don\u2019t believe in God, and you don\u2019t believe in heaven, and you don\u2019t believe Jesus rose from the dead three days after dying \u2014 and neither do I.\u201d He knew that she was right, and he began telling friends that he was a \u201cpost-Christian.\u201d They treated him like an obviously gay man coming out of the closet. \u201cPeople were like, \u2018Yeah, we\u2019ve known this a long time,\u2019\u2009\u201d he says. \u201c\u2009\u2018Why did it take you so long to figure it out?\u2019\u2009\u201dFor Campolo, admitting that he had totally lost his faith was oddly comforting \u2014 he could stop living a lie \u2014 but also confusing. He loved talking to people, caring for them, helping them. He loved everything about Christian ministry except the Christianity. Now that he had crossed the bridge to apostasy, he needed a new vocation.But as he took stock of the rest of his life, Campolo decided that there was no reason an atheist couldn\u2019t still be a minister too. Instead of comforting people with the good news of Jesus, he\u2019d preach secular humanism, a kinder cousin of atheism. He\u2019d help them accept that we\u2019re all going to die, that this life is all there is and that therefore we have to make the most of our brief, glorious time on earth. And he would spread this message using the best evangelical techniques \u2014 the same ones he had mastered as a Christian.In the United States, since World War II, atheist activism has been located mainly in local skeptics\u2019 clubs, whose members also gravitated toward science fiction and other walks of geek life. The clubs developed a culture of conferences: hotel-ballroom events with lots of men attending mostly-male panels, followed by book signings.Over the last 30 years or so, these conferences have grown in tandem with the rise of the Christian right and megachurch evangelicalism, as atheists sought comfort in a parallel world. Best-selling authors like Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens drew huge crowds at these \u201ccons.\u201d In their books, lectures and television appearances, these atheists preach an uncompromising scientism, exalt Darwin and barely conceal a sentiment that believers deserve mockery or, if one is feeling generous, pity.But quite recently, as young people have drifted from religious observance \u2014 according to a 2015 Pew survey, 36 percent of those born between 1990 and 1996 are religiously unaffiliated \u2014 both the Christian right and what we might call \u201cbig atheism\u201d have lost influence. The energy now is not with the controversial author-celebrities but with start-up groups, many on college campuses, that have more gender balance and less strident rhetoric and are eager to do better than thumb their noses at believers. Crucially, these nonbelievers identify as humanist rather than atheist. That is, they\u2019ve sided with a more welcoming version of nonbelief, focused on the joy and potential inherent in being human rather than on gainsaying others\u2019 convictions. Their project is to talk about leading a good life without God.This was the world that the Campolos began to explore after Bart\u2019s accident. They visited meetings, in Chicago and Los Angeles, of a group called Sunday Assembly, which was founded in London by two comedians and now has roughly 70 branches. Despite the name, Sunday Assembly gathers monthly in informal meetings centered on lectures and singalongs of popular songs. Campolo was impressed by the message, but the meetings themselves left him cold. The singalongs didn\u2019t really work, because radio hits aren\u2019t written to be sung by groups. \u201cAnd they meet once a month \u2014 once a month, if you\u2019re trying to build a community!\u201dCampolo eventually came across a book called \u201cGood Without God: What a Billion Nonreligious People Believe,\u201d by Greg M. Epstein, the head of one of the most influential humanist groups in the country, Humanist Hub. The group began at Harvard and now has anywhere from 300 to 350 people at its weekly meetings, only a third of them students. Epstein, 39, its leader since 2005, has become a godfather to the movement, the anti-Dawkins. He doesn\u2019t want to lecture people or talk them out of anything; he sits with them in circles, sips water from coffee mugs and listens. There are about a dozen humanist chaplaincies in the country, and of those, the chaplains at Yale, Stanford and Tufts all trained with Epstein. In July 2014 Campolo flew to Boston to talk with Epstein for three days about the future of humanism.\u201cI was sitting with Bart going over all of this, thinking about what the future needed to look like,\u201d Epstein told me. \u201cI told him if I wasn\u2019t at Harvard, L.A. would be where I wanted to be.\u201dCampolo liked the idea of being on a campus. He was, in a sense, not unlike a college student himself: away from the only home he ever knew, ripped from his comforting traditions, trying to figure out who he was, now that he could be anything. He could relate to students. And while church attendance is collapsing among young people \u2014 only 27 percent of millennials attend religious services weekly \u2014 campuses have relatively vibrant religious scenes. Chaplains\u2019 offices have resources and geographically circumscribed target audiences. Many religious-outreach groups, from evangelical Christians to the Chabad sect of Judaism, plant houses near campuses to minister to students, a potentially receptive audience. They may want to try on Christianity, or Buddhism, or whatever \u2014 even Wiccans at the United States Air Force Academy have an area set aside for worship.Epstein told Campolo about Varun Soni, the dean of religious life at U.S.C., and in 2014 Campolo began talking with Soni on the phone. After a few conversations, Campolo had been offered an office, an email account and a title: humanist chaplain at the University of Southern California. No salary, but it was a start.Bart\u2019s father, Tony Campolo, never forced his son to become a believer. That reticence was fitting for the gentler sort of evangelical he was. Tony didn\u2019t have a TV network like Pat Robertson or a university like Jerry Falwell; he achieved his renown as an itinerant preacher and a founder of the \u201cred-letter Christians\u201d movement, an effort to refocus evangelicals away from politics and back to the teachings (about poverty, love, charity) of Jesus, whose words are printed in red in many Bibles.The younger Campolo found his way to religion in high school, when he fell in with some guys who were active in a Christian youth group. For a while, he was always with them but wasn\u2019t yet one of them. Then one day, a member of the group took Bart out to breakfast at a McDonald\u2019s in Wayne, Pa. \u201cHe said, \u2018You\u2019ve been hanging around us a long time, Bart,\u2019\u2009\u201d Campolo recalls. \u201cAnd he said: \u2018I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever really accepted Jesus as your personal lord and savior. So what about it?\u2019\u2009\u201d Sitting in a booth, Campolo bowed his head and recited a prayer accepting Jesus into his heart.His faith had already begun to falter by the next summer, while he was working at a camp for poor children in Camden, N.J. Some of his campers had been sexually abused, yet his religion told him that a benevolent God controlled every last thing that happens on earth. He had a hard time squaring these two thoughts. Later, as a freshman at Haverford College, he had two gay roommates. At the time, even liberal evangelicals like his dad treated homosexual behavior as a sin, but Campolo couldn\u2019t bring himself to think ill of his roommates. He instead adjusted his theology to make room for them. Campolo finished college at Brown and eventually moved to West Philadelphia, where he started a ministry.At first, even as he began doing Christian field work, Campolo resisted his father\u2019s vocation of big-time preaching. But when he had to raise money for his mission program, the best way he knew was to hit the Christian conference circuit. After all, as a boy, he\u2019d watched his dad. He knew how it was done. And he did it nearly as well, with his own distinct style. Where Tony had a grounded, authoritative stillness in the pulpit, Bart was a more hyperactive speaker, caffeinated by Christ. He was funny, alive, hard to ignore. He connected, and soon he was touring the country preaching the Gospel. Campolo ran his mission, raised money on the road and, after his father had a stroke in 2002, spent one day a week helping him run his ministry.The abstract, bureaucratic nature of the work wore him down, and in 2005 the family decided together to move to Cincinnati, where some friends had already settled. Campolo, his wife and his two children moved into a ramshackle house with no real appliances, just a space heater and a hot plate. By day, Campolo was still traveling and working for his father remotely. In the evenings, he and Marty began hosting dinners for people they met in the neighborhood. Their informal fellowship soon included junkies, ex-cons, welfare moms and other neighborhood folk. These new friends helped him realize that the work of a minister is often not to save people, as so many evangelicals try to do, or even to change them, but just to love them unconditionally. He remembers one guy in particular, a toothless addict who had been in and out of jail his whole life. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to fix him,\u201d Campolo says. But by giving the man a community, Campolo told me, you can give his life some meaning. And maybe that\u2019s enough.The topic was friendship, and Campolo\u2019s text was \u201cThe Friendship Factor,\u201d Alan Loy McGinnis\u2019s 1979 megaselling self-help book. There was a reason he turned to it. When Campolo arrived on the U.S.C. campus, in the fall of 2014, he quickly discovered that the fundamental problem of many students was loneliness. He hypothesizes that their focus as high-school students on r\u00e9sum\u00e9-building and test-taking, so crucial to getting into college now, has left many of them socially adrift once they arrive. \u201cKids who show up at college on the other end of that rat race are very good at networking,\u201d he says. \u201cBut they are not always very good at deeper connections.\u201d The grown-ups in their lives are also primarily focused on achievement and rarely steer them toward the important questions.Campolo told me that when students come to talk about a job they\u2019ve been offered, he asks questions like: \u201cWhat\u2019s the culture like at that place? The guy who interviewed you \u2014 would you want to end up like him, with the kind of marriage he has and the kind of friendships he has?\u201d Campolo went on: \u201cAnd they say, \u2018Huh, I never thought about that.\u2019 And you want to say: \u2018Where are your parents? Or your pastor? What is your Uncle Joe doing? Why is nobody asking value-oriented questions about your life?\u2019\u2009\u201d\u201cThe Friendship Factor\u201d is \u201cthe hokiest book you will ever read,\u201d Campolo told his flock. But, he said, it brings a hopeful message: that friendship, like eating well or getting fit, isn\u2019t a matter of luck. Expecting fulfilling relationships to materialize magically was, he said, \u201cits own form of supernatural woo-woo.\u201d The book\u2019s message was a distillation of his larger project: Happiness, connection and community, which many people attend church to find, can be achieved through human agency. It\u2019s a modest claim but profoundly empowering, in a way that ancient stories may not be, especially when they come from traditions that few young people take literally.Besides, while Campolo believes that life can be meaningful with or without a god, his work these days is less about grandiose metaphysical claims than about simple acts of hand-holding. To 100 or so students, Campolo is a confidant, a stand-in parent, but one who doesn\u2019t expect anything of them. \u201cOver the last two weeks,\u201d Campolo says, \u201cI got an email from a young woman saying, \u2018A friend told me I should talk to you because I am a senior, graduating, and have no idea what to do with my life.\u2019 Another student comes to me, \u2018I got sexually assaulted and don\u2019t know what to do now.\u2019\u2009\u201d Perhaps these young adults are looking for a humanist community, but surely many of them just need a grown-up who isn\u2019t grading them, isn\u2019t interviewing them and wants to listen. \u201cI don\u2019t know these kids well,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is just what happens when you are available.\u201dHis role became particularly clear to him after the presidential election. At U.S.C., many students were distraught. Some of them probably marched; others prayed. U.S.C. is huge, one of the five largest private schools in the country, and some of its most popular concentrations include finance, accounting, management and marketing \u2014 which is to say, the undergraduates, when faced with questions about what kind of world they want to build and what their role could be, might not think of their professors, if they even knew them, as having much guidance to offer. So Campolo suspected that some students would want to talk to him. He emailed his list, offering office hours at a picnic table on campus. Over the next week, about 15 students sought him out. \u201cA lot of people went running to their pastors,\u201d Campolo says. \u201cAnd my kids did the same.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And I\u2019d ask social democrats more widely and Marxists to question it as well.Whenever the left-liberal coalition in the United States is forced to choose between a concern of workers and (for lack of a better word) the activist left, they choose the left.

It\u2019s true on immigration.The party doesn\u2019t have any credible case for helping the old industrial economy (perhaps in no small part because there is no way to help the old industrial economy, given the rise of automation for one thing). Even if it\u2019s well intentioned, the Democrats\u2019 alternative \u2014 to boost the pay and security of new service-sector jobs \u2014 just isn\u2019t what these voters seem to want.That will start to come in very soon, but probably won\u2019t be completed for months.

And third is the microdata for pre-election polls, which includes demographic data and vote choice for all of a survey\u2019s respondents, not just the summary result that\u2019s published.At the end of all of this, I suspect we\u2019ll have a much better sense of turnout, vote shifts since 2012 and how the polls were off.The results in Iowa were the clearest illustration that the Republican landslide on Tuesday was not just because of low Democratic turnout in off-year elections. On Tuesday, Joni Ernst, now a Republican senator-elect, won a decisive nine-point victory. She swept much of traditionally Democratic eastern Iowa, where Democrats have long fared well with rural voters.These gains suggest that demographic trends have not doomed Republicans to minority-party status, as some political analysts predicted.The next Republican presidential candidate could outperform Mr. Romney among white voters by holding Republican gains in the South and winning back some of the white Obama voters of the rural North.So, personally, I\u2019m not really looking back on 2014 and thinking \u201cwe should have known\u201d Clinton would lose in the way that she did. I think 2016 with Trump was much more of a decisive break from recent trends than it was a continuation of what we saw between 2008 and 2014.I\u2019m not at all convinced that Michigan was part of Marco Rubio\u2019s path to victory, for instance. I suspect that a more traditional Republican would have been highly competitive in Virginia and Colorado \u2014 just as competitive as in Pennsylvania, for example.I don\u2019t think Rubio could have won some of these white working-class Obama counties in Wisconsin by 25 points, for instance. I absolutely think he could have won Wisconsin.Anyway, Steve Bullock is the governor of Montana. He won re-election last month, even as Clinton lost the state by 20 points.On paper, he\u2019s interesting. He has the sort of complicated biography that gives him the potential to connect with several different parts of the Democratic coalition: He\u2019s a red-state populist with a strong record for progressives on campaign finance when he was the state\u2019s attorney general. He has a pedigree of Claremont McKenna, Columbia Law, professor at George Washington University that, unfortunately, I think is a factor in whether the party elite take him seriously.Obviously \u201con paper\u201d doesn\u2019t mean all that much \u2014 just ask Scott Walker.I\u2019ve watched a few YouTube videos, and Bullock seems compelling to me. (He was on Rachel Maddow\u2019s show when he was attorney general, talking about his suit against Citizens United.)Who knows whether he would hold up in national politics, or whether he\u2019s even interested.He\u2019s just 50 years old, too. The Democrats don\u2019t have too many options who have won re-election in that age range.Advertisement"}

That included 15 percent surcharges above the original cost of the contracts, Judge Ercolini added.Mrs. Kirchner, who was president for two terms between 2007 and 2015, has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, and characterizes her legal troubles as little more than political persecution by her successor and rival, President Mauricio Macri.Mrs. Kirchner was indicted in May on charges of manipulating Argentina\u2019s Central Bank to bolster the peso. She is also under investigation in several other cases, many of which include Mr. B\u00e1ez, who was detained in April in a separate case relating to money laundering. Mr. B\u00e1ez has denied all charges against him.The indictments were announced a day after Mr. Macri fired the finance minister, Alfonso Prat-Gay, in what was the first cabinet shake-up since he took office last year in the midst of a deep recession. The economy has taken longer to recover than he promised; economic activity plunged 4.7 percent in October, compared to the previous year, according to official figures released on Tuesday.Some analysts say the latest indictment could help Mr. Macri\u2019s center-right government make its case, even if implicitly, that it needs more time to revive the economy.\u201cIn the context of a weak economy, the government needs to remind voters of who came before them and the inheritance they received,\u201d said Marcelo Bermol\u00e9n, a political science professor at Universidad Austral in Buenos Aires. \u201cMuch of the strength of the government lies\u201d in keeping Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s profile alive so it will have someone to blame.\u201cThis could be useful for her in terms of victimization, which she is already doing,\u201d said Sergio Berensztein, a political analyst.Mr. Berensztein added, however, that history was ultimately not on Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s side: \u201cEx-presidents in Argentina have not been really successful in regaining power once they leave office.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Electoral College Settles Donald Trump\u2019s Victory, but Little Else", "Date": "2016-12-19", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 In Florida, protesters swarmed the Capitol rotunda, one hoisting a \u201cTrump Is Too Rusky\u201d sign featuring a hammer and sickle. In Wisconsin\u2019s statehouse, a heckler shouted, \u201cWe\u2019re all going to go to war and die thanks to you,\u201d during the formal meeting of the Electoral College.And in New York, an elector by the name of William Jefferson Clinton cast his vote for his wife and then came out to make plain that he believes Donald J. Trump won the presidency only because of outside interference in the election.\u201cWe had the Russians and the F.B.I., and she couldn\u2019t prevail against that, but she did everything else and still won by 2.8 million votes,\u201d Mr. Clinton said, his determined smile belying his fury.The meeting of the Electoral College after presidential elections has long been little more than a tradition-bound formality, with political insiders gathering to ratify the preferences of their state\u2019s voters and distribute 538 electoral votes. Yet as with so much else in this turbulent election year, even that civic ritual was punctuated by anger and dissent.Results of the U.S. electoral vote.Democrats were unable to persuade enough electors to withhold their support for Mr. Trump. He easily cleared the 270-vote threshold needed to defeat Hillary Clinton, with only two Republican electors declining to cast their vote for the president-elect. But the protests at state capitols across the country offered a preview of a tumultuous inauguration and first 100 days of the new administration.Presidential electors are bound by tradition and often state law to support their party\u2019s candidates. But this time, many Republican electors were inundated with phone calls, emails and even threats demanding that they vote for someone other than Mr. Trump. Leaders of groups that were lobbying the electors had privately believed they had a chance to sway enough Republican electors to defect, denying him an Electoral College majority and throwing the election to the House of Representatives.But while Mr. Trump\u2019s opponents needed 37 Republican defectors to bring his electoral-vote tally below 270, the bulk of electors who broke ranks \u2014 four in Washington State \u2014 were Democrats who otherwise would have voted for Mrs. Clinton. Instead, three voted for former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, a Republican, and one for Faith Spotted Eagle, a Native American tribal leader who has led opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline.Kellyanne Conway, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, said the election \u201cwasn\u2019t a squeaker.\u201d\u201cThe professional political left is attempting to foment a permanent opposition that is corrosive to our constitutional democracy and ignores what just happened in this election,\u201d she said. Liberals cannot, she added, \u201cwave magic pixie dust and make this go away.\u201dAs for whether Mr. Trump would now begin to offer a hand of friendship to his critics, Ms. Conway noted that he had met with multiple Democrats and spoken with President Obama \u201cseveral times.\u201d \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019ll be president of all people,\u2019 but the left is trying to delegitimize his election,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to deny him what he just earned. So why is the burden always on him?\u201dDemocrats vow that burden will only increase.\u201cThere\u2019s not going to be a grace period this time because everybody on our side thinks he\u2019s illegitimate and poses a massive threat,\u201d said Adam Jentleson, a top aide to the retiring Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada and minority leader, who next year is going to work for one of the hubs of the opposition, the Center for American Progress.With liberals determined to confront the president-elect and Mr. Trump continuing to scorn his critics while denying intelligence officials\u2019 assessment that Russia was responsible for hacking Democrats, the divisions so stark during this year\u2019s campaign are on a course to grow worse.Washington has been drifting toward perpetual political combat for more than two decades, at least since the Newt Gingrich-led Republican revolution of 1994.But this time, \u201cPeople on the left are scared about Trump in a way they were not scared about Reagan or George W. Bush,\u201d said Michael Kazin, a professor of history at Georgetown University who has written extensively on the history of liberalism.Moreover, the uneasiness with Mr. Trump has hardly receded in the nearly six weeks since his election.Half of Americans surveyed in an NBC-Wall Street Journal poll last week approved of how the president-elect was preparing for the job, a figure far lower than when it was asked of Mr. Clinton in 1992 (77 percent) and Mr. Obama in 2008 (73 percent).Democrats, after a period of shell shock from their loss, say they will offer a well-financed resistance. Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet selections so far, and his refusal to acknowledge Russian efforts to affect the election, have only solidified Democrats\u2019 resolve.But resolve will also confront a reality: Republicans control both chambers of Congress and are in sync with Mr. Trump on many issues. Democrats can make the cabinet confirmation process uncomfortable for Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees, but their chances to actually block anyone rest with the so far unlikely prospect of Republican defections.While the left of American politics often lacks cohesion, leaders of many groups say this time will be different. The Center for American Progress and some groups directed by David Brock, a liberal strategist, are gearing up for the fight; the Democracy Alliance, a progressive umbrella group, is preparing for a March donor summit to focus entirely on how to regain power in state capitals. And a number of left-leaning activists are planning protests in conjunction with Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration next month.Democrats have not resolved intraparty tensions that were laid bare in the primary between Mrs. Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders, but say that they are unified in their view that the Trump presidency represents an existential threat.The matter of what exactly to confront Mr. Trump over is harder to figure.In the next few weeks alone, progressives will be forced to decide how much money and attention to devote to Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet and White House appointments, his pick to fill a vacant seat on the Supreme Court, his financial conflicts of interest and his stated plan to quickly repeal the Affordable Care Act. That\u2019s not to mention unexpected foreign or domestic crises that may arise as Mr. Trump takes the oath of office.\u201cIn terms of needing to fight Trump and get back on track in the states, the left is unified,\u201d said Gara LaMarche, the president of the Democracy Alliance. \u201cThe harder question is how you fight intelligently and strategically when every house is burning down.\u201dWhile progressives were furious with how Mr. Bush came to office in 2001, he was part of a well-known political family and had run on a message of \u201ccompassionate conservatism.\u201dThe arrival in Washington of Ronald Reagan as leader of the conservative movement is the better comparison, Mr. Kazin said. He noted that then, as now, liberal advocacy groups and publications saw their support soar in the days after Reagan\u2019s election and that progressives organized vast protests (a quarter-million people descended on the capital in September 1981 for a little-remembered Solidarity Day march organized by the A.F.L.-C.I.O.).Reagan, however, had won in a 44-state landslide, capturing 489 electoral votes and leaving little doubt about his mandate. Mr. Trump, as the protesters Monday sought to make clear, is coming to office under far different circumstances.Jonathan Martin reported from Washington, and Michael Wines from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Conventional Home Mortgage Loan Limit to Rise Next Year", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byYour Money AdviserFEDERAL regulators have raised the amount of money that home buyers can borrow while still qualifying for more flexible mortgage terms, starting next year.Here is what is changing: For the first time in a decade, the Federal Housing Finance Agency raised the dollar limit on loans that qualify for purchase by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled mortgage finance giants. Such conventional or \u201cconforming\u201d loans are less risky for lenders, so they typically qualify for lower down payments, and often lower interest rates, allowing more borrowers to buy a home as prices rise.Loans that exceed the limit are considered \u201cjumbo\u201d mortgages, which lenders hold themselves or sell to private investors; they typically require larger down payments and stricter underwriting.Starting in January, the loan limit for single-family homes will increase by $7,000, to just over $424,000, in most parts of the country. In some expensive areas \u2014 like Boston, New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. \u2014 the limit will go to just over $686,000, and it will be even higher in a few markets in Hawaii and Alaska.The \u201cmodest\u201d move is another recognition that housing markets have recovered from the real-estate crash, said David Stevens, chief executive of the Mortgage Bankers Association.The higher limit will give more borrowers access to the more-flexible terms of government-backed loans, helping to ensure that home buyers can still get affordable mortgages as home values rise, said Aaron Terrazas, a senior economist with the real estate website Zillow.Zillow expects home prices to rise 3.6 percent in 2017 and noted that in some markets \u2014 such as the resort area of the Hamptons outside New York City \u2014 homes are worth more now than ever.Zillow estimates that about 30,000 more homes in the New York metropolitan area will fall into conforming loan territory because of the new limits.\u201cIt provides a little bit more wiggle room,\u201d Mr. Terrazas said.Still, some real estate professionals say the $7,000 increase, amounting to a rise of less than 2 percent, isn\u2019t large enough to offset spiraling home prices in many markets. Keith Dunham, chief executive of HomeCity Real Estate in Austin, Tex., said that in his area, the housing supply was not sufficient to meet the rising demand from people moving to Austin, a popular technology-oriented city, so the modestly higher loan limit would probably not make a big difference. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t move the needle,\u201d he said.Still, Elizabeth Ann Stribling-Kivlan, president of Stribling & Associates in New York City, said the move might provide a psychological boost for home shoppers. \u201cIt gives extra confidence that one can buy a home,\u201d she said.Here are some questions and answers about mortgage loans:How large a down payment do I need for a conventional loan?The standard requirement is 20 percent down, but conventional loans can now be had with down payments as low as 5 percent or even 3 percent, according to the housing finance agency. However, borrowers often are required to buy mortgage insurance, which adds to their monthly payment, and meet other criteria to qualify.Will higher mortgage rates make it more expensive to borrow?Even so, rates remain historically low, said Mr. Terrazas of Zillow. In 2006, the annual average was above 6 percent. And throughout the 1980s, for instance, double-digit rates were the norm.Where can I check the new loan limits for 2017 in my area?Email: yourmoneyadviser@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Wealthy Cabinet Picks to Undergo Financial Scrutiny He Didn\u2019t Face", "Date": "2016-12-12", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For the billionaires, the multimillionaires and the plain well-off people whom President-elect Donald J. Trump is choosing for his cabinet, the first step to office will be the sort of grilling he didn\u2019t face \u2014 on potential business conflicts of interest and, for some, tax returns \u2014 courtesy of the Senate sleuths who have taken their toll in the past.President Obama\u2019s first Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, was nearly derailed in 2009. His first choice for secretary of health and human services, Tom Daschle, did not make it through that year.Now the billionaires Betsy DeVos, Linda McMahon and Wilbur L. Ross Jr., and the multimillionaires Rex W. Tillerson, Ben Carson, Elaine Chao, Steven Mnuchin, Representative Tom Price, Andrew F. Puzder and Todd Ricketts can expect much of the same scrutiny.\u201cWith the president-elect flouting a 40-year bipartisan tradition of disclosure and transparency, we think it\u2019s more important than ever to ensure that senior officials across government aren\u2019t operating under a different tax code than everyone else,\u201d warned Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, which has upended its share of nominees.After nearly two centuries in which Senate reviews were cursory at best, that confirmation process has become increasingly arduous, regardless of party, and especially in the committees that require nominees\u2019 tax returns.President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s cabinet and top staff are shaping up to be a mix of wealthy Washington outsiders, Republican insiders and former military officers who have been critical of the Obama administration.Dean Zerbe, a former counsel to the Finance Committee, had some advice for Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees facing that panel: Do not copy the president-elect\u2019s defiance on disclosure. \u201cThe committee will say, \u2018Bless your heart. Now send us your tax returns,\u2019\u201d Mr. Zerbe said.Senate Democrats will be pressing in January to make the scrutiny even broader. They propose that all committees make nominees privately submit their three most recent federal tax returns. Three committees \u2014 Finance, Budget, and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \u2014 already do so. Together they have responsibility for examining five cabinet-level officials before confirmation: the secretaries of Treasury, health and human services, and homeland security, and the president\u2019s trade representative and budget director.For Democrats, the tax-disclosure proposal is a way to underscore Mr. Trump\u2019s refusal to release his returns, despite a four-decade tradition of presidential candidates doing so. More to the point, they will have ample opportunity to press home their contention that a number of his cabinet choices have wealth and backgrounds at odds with his populist pitch.The Finance Committee chairman, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, has served notice that Trump nominees \u201cwill undergo the same bipartisan vetting process as the nominees from previous administrations,\u201d and will not get a public hearing until the committee staff\u2019s private examination \u2014 including a review of the nominees\u2019 tax returns from the past three years \u2014 is complete.For the very wealthy Mr. Mnuchin especially, the multipage questionnaire that the Finance Committee uses for its review illustrates the hoops a nominee must jump through to pass muster. It includes listing all jobs held since college, all business relationships, political activities and contributions, any legal or ethics issues, and a precise accounting of financial net worth for the nominee, a spouse and dependents. Nominees must answer whether they have paid all local, state and federal taxes, including those for household employees \u2014 a common tripwire.To gauge potential conflicts of interest, the questionnaire also asks for \u201cany investments, obligations, liabilities or other relationships\u201d and any business dealings and lobbying activities in the past 10 years that could be problems, as well as for an explanation of how those potential conflicts will be resolved. Separate opinions are required from both the federal Office of Government Ethics and the ethics officer of the agency a nominee would lead.Even as Mr. Trump resists a complete break with his far-flung businesses, a nominee before the Finance Committee must answer whether he or she, if confirmed, will \u201csever all connections with your present employers, business firms, associations or organizations.\u201d If not, the nominee must provide details of how those connections will be handled.The questionnaire must be notarized \u2014 providing false answers is potentially a federal crime \u2014 and the nominee\u2019s tax returns attached. The documents are not made public, though information may come out in hearings or be leaked, often by senators. Neither Mr. Daschle\u2019s nor Mr. Geithner\u2019s tax returns were made public, but their offenses were widely aired.When Senate aides discover problems, a nominee is given a choice: Agree to a public report on the infraction and pay all taxes, penalties and interest, or quietly withdraw.A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.\u201cThose are the not-very-attractive options a nominee was given,\u201d said Mark Patterson, a Democrat who was the staff director for the Finance Committee in the late 1990s and the chief of staff at the Treasury Department from 2009 to 2013.Mr. Zerbe, who was on the staff of the Finance Committee during most of President George W. Bush\u2019s administration, recalled of a few subcabinet nominees, \u201cThey\u2019d fade away so as not to be embarrassed.\u201d He said common transgressions included taking questionable deductions for home-office expenses.But high-level nominees often cannot escape embarrassment.Such close scrutiny of nominees, now taken for granted, is relatively recent in the history of the Senate\u2019s exercise of its constitutional confirmation power.Not until the 1950s is there evidence of committees examining a president\u2019s picks, Betty K. Koed, the Senate historian, said. The first record of a committee hearing on a nominee was in 1953: In just over an hour, the steel magnate George Humphrey, the sole witness, answered questions about his stock holdings and went on to be confirmed as Treasury secretary two days later.Starting in 1981, the Finance Committee began receiving reports on nominees from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the new Office of Government Ethics. Eventually it became the first panel to require nominees\u2019 tax returns.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Insurance Policies on Slaves: New York Life\u2019s Complicated Past", "Date": "2016-12-18", "News": "In its 19th-century beginnings, New York Life Insurance sold 508 policies covering slaves. Their descendants are grappling with it.Supported bySales were sluggish that year. So the company looked south.There, in Richmond, Va., an enterprising New York Life agent sold more than 30 policies in a single day in February 1846. Soon, advertisements began appearing in newspapers from Wilmington, N.C., to Louisville as the New York-based company encouraged Southerners to buy insurance to protect their most precious commodity: their slaves.Alive, slaves were among a white man\u2019s most prized assets. Dead, they were considered virtually worthless. Life insurance changed that calculus, allowing slave owners to recoup three-quarters of a slave\u2019s value in the event of an untimely death.James De Peyster Ogden, New York Life\u2019s first president, would later describe the American system of human bondage as \u201cevil.\u201d But by 1847, insurance policies on slaves accounted for a third of the policies in a firm that would become one of the nation\u2019s Fortune 100 companies.Banks absorbed by JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo allowed Southerners seeking loans to use their slaves as collateral and took possession of some of them when their owners defaulted.Like New York Life, Aetna and US Life also sold insurance policies to slave owners, particularly those whose laborers engaged in hazardous work in mines, lumber mills, turpentine factories and steamboats in the industrializing sectors of the South. US Life, a subsidiary of AIG, declined to comment on its slave policy sales. Wachovia, one of Wells Fargo\u2019s predecessor companies, has apologized for its historic ties to slavery as have JPMorgan Chase and Aetna.More than 40 other firms, mostly based in the South, sold such policies, too, though documentation is scarce and most closed their doors generations ago.New York Life survived. Its foray into the slave insurance business did not prove to be lucrative: The company ended up paying out nearly as much in death claims \u2014 about $232,000 in today\u2019s dollars \u2014 as it received in annual payments. But in the span of about three years, it sold 508 policies, more than Aetna and US Life combined, according to available records.Now, the descendants of one of those slaves \u2014 who were recently identified by The New York Times \u2014 are coming to terms with the realization that one of the nation\u2019s biggest insurance companies sold policies on their ancestors and hundreds of other enslaved laborers.Policy No. 447 covered Nathan York, a slave who toiled in the Virginia coal mines where the earth often collapsed on its subterranean work force. Policy No. 1141 insured a slave known as Warwick, who fed the fiery furnaces on a Kentucky steamboat. Policy No. 1150 covered Anthony, who labored amid the whirling blades of a sawmill in North Carolina.\u201cWe profoundly regret that in the 1840s our predecessor company, Nautilus Insurance Company, insured the lives of slaves for a brief period of time,\u201d Kevin Heine, a spokesman for the company, said in a written statement. \u201cWhile we cannot change our history, our longstanding recognition of it has helped shape our commitment to the African-American community.\u201dCompany officials allowed The Times to review several ledgers from its archive, but declined to allow a reporter to interview its archivist to determine whether additional records related to the slave policies still exist. The executives said that slave policies generated only about 5 percent of total revenues during the three fiscal years in which the policies were sold. They said the policies proved to be unprofitable and did not drive the company\u2019s growth.\u201cWe can be disturbed by this, but we shouldn\u2019t be surprised by it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just Southern companies that benefited from slavery; many Northern institutions also benefited directly or indirectly.\u201dThe advertisement appeared in the Richmond Enquirer on Jan. 29, 1846. It described a new firm offering life insurance for slaves employed in any \u201coccupation where there may be danger or risque.\u201dTheir slaves dug for black ore in underground shafts that oozed deadly gases and shuddered with explosions. Dozens of enslaved African-Americans had died in a blast just seven years earlier, mining records show, a catastrophic financial loss for their white owners.Nicholas Mills, who owned shares in the Midlothian Coal Mining Company, was determined to protect himself from such a calamity. So he purchased policies on more than 20 of his enslaved laborers, including Mr. York, a 40-year-old coal miner and the father of a baby boy.The premiums Mr. Mills paid in the spring of 1846 \u2014 about $7,000 in today\u2019s dollars \u2014 flowed into the New York Life office on Wall Street, where employees began recording the names, ages, policy numbers and occupations of the slaves who were insured.New York City\u2019s merchants helped to finance the nation\u2019s premier export crop, cotton, and the purchase of the land and slaves needed to grow it. They controlled the boat companies that shipped the cotton to Europe, leading one Southern editor to describe New York City as \u201calmost as dependent upon Southern slavery as Charleston.\u201d And some of these businessmen assumed prominent positions at New York Life.Mr. De Peyster Ogden, the company\u2019s first president, was a cotton merchant who grew up in a home tended by slaves. He would become a prominent defender of slavery, describing it as an unfortunate, but inextricable part of the nation\u2019s economy.Several wealthy members of the company\u2019s board also opposed efforts to end slavery, including William H. Aspinwall, a builder of the trans-Panama railroad; Schuyler Livingston, the New York representative of Lloyd\u2019s of London; and James Brown, a banker whose firm, Brown Brothers, controlled several plantations in the South. (A board member, Henry W. Hicks, on the other hand, came from a family of abolitionists.)It was no surprise then that New York Life tried to tap into the flood of money pouring into the city from the South. In the beginning, the payments from slaveholders and other customers helped the company generate interest and cover the rent of its Wall Street office ($500 for the first year), the salary of its first president ($500), commissions for agents (roughly 5 to 10 percent of premiums), the fees for the medical doctors who examined the slaves ($2 per exam) and office upkeep like painting, carpeting and postage.The clothbound ledgers, which describe New York Life\u2019s revenues and expenses in spidery script, also document how the company institutionalized the nation\u2019s racial hierarchy.Officials typically insured the lives of white customers for $1,000 to $5,000 in the early years. Slaves, on the other hand, were considered property under the law and were typically insured for about $400, the records show, and some for as little as $200.Payouts from death claims usually went to the grieving relatives of white customers. In the case of slaves, however, it was the slave owners \u2014 who insured their laborers and paid the annual premiums \u2014 who collected.Abraham S. Wooldridge, a mining magnate and business partner of Mr. Mills, praised the company\u2019s swift response after two of his slaves perished on the job.\u201cThe insurance was promptly paid,\u201d Mr. Wooldridge said in an advertisement published by the Richmond Whig newspaper in 1847. \u201cI have entire confidence in the solvency and fair dealing of the company.\u201dAs the death claims mounted, New York Life\u2019s board voted on April 19, 1848, to discontinue the sale of slave policies. It would take about six years for the last slave policies to lapse.But the names of the slaves remained inscribed in accounting books that moved from one office to the next as the company grew, handwritten clues that would link the past to the present.Ms. Ross, a retired public health scientist, prayed at First Baptist just as her parents, grandparents and great-grandparents did before her. She knew the names of the founding members by heart.Ms. Ross\u2019s great-great-grandfather was Mr. York, a founding member of her church and one of the hundreds of slaves whose lives were insured by New York Life.\u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Ms. Ross, who is 66 and had researched the family histories of several church members, but not her own. \u201cYou have just opened my eyes.\u201dMs. Ross worked in New York City in the mid-1970s and never dreamed that one of the city\u2019s insurance companies had tried to profit from her ancestor\u2019s enslavement. \u201cI think it was pathetic that they used the labor, the hard work, blood, sweat and tears of the slaves\u201d to help their business, she said.Even so, she considers herself lucky. Her great-great grandfather survived his time as an enslaved miner. After the Civil War, Mr. York continued digging for coal and earned enough money to buy land and cattle. He helped to establish a school for newly freed slaves and became the patriarch of a sprawling family.Others were less fortunate. The stone ruins of the Grove Shaft building, the remains of the Midlothian Coal Mining Company, are only a short drive from Ms. Ross\u2019s home. Whenever she visits, she prays for the enslaved miners who never made it home.Godfrey, a 50-year-old slave who was also insured by New York Life, died in a fire in Midlothian on Nov. 20, 1847.\u201cBurned to death,\u201d reads the entry in the company\u2019s accounting of the dead.The insurance clerks on Wall Street did not record Godfrey\u2019s last name or the location of his burial place. But they described what happened next: Mr. Mills, Godfrey\u2019s owner, filed a claim with New York Life for the loss of his human property.Within three months, the company delivered, paying him $337.Kitty Bennett and Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Will Donald Trump\u2019s Corporate \u2018Tax Holiday\u2019 Create Jobs? Not Necessarily", "Date": "2016-12-26", "News": "Supported byPresident-elect Donald J. Trump has said he would like to create a \u201ctax holiday\u201d so that American companies can bring back profit that was generated overseas at a lower rate. In his view, this influx of cash will create jobs.But corporate boards and executives may have different ideas.They are likely to use much of the estimated $2 trillion held overseas to acquire businesses in the United States, to buy back their own stock or to pay down debt, say advisers of America\u2019s top corporate executives.Merger bankers \u201care sharpening their pencils with what types of deals those larger companies can look at,\u201d said Marc-Anthony Hourihan, co-head of mergers and acquisitions in the Americas for the Swiss bank UBS. \u201cI think M.&A. will be fairly high on the list.\u201dAmerican corporations have kept an accumulation of earnings abroad because they would be subject to paying more taxes when they bring it home.If they were to bring that capital back, those companies could use it to invest in their businesses, which may in turn create jobs. Yet that is only one of several options.If the priority turns out to be deals, that would be good news for investment bankers who generate fees from large advisory assignments. It would be less so for American workers who might get laid off as a result of cost cuts derived from combining two companies.Some of those cuts were tied to mergers and acquisitions. As part of the study, Oracle explained how its repatriated funds were used for two acquisitions: Retek, a software provider to the retail industry, and PeopleSoft, a rival in enterprise software. After buying both for a combined $11 billion, Oracle \u201celiminated thousands of jobs,\u201d the study found.Today, bankers are rearranging their chess boards, trying to figure out which companies may want to make moves, and which ones might be ripe for the taking. That has kept the bankers in technology and health care busy. Some of the top companies on everyone\u2019s watch list include Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent company), Amgen, Apple, Cisco, General Electric, Hewlett-Packard, Johnson & Johnson, IBM, Microsoft and Oracle.Yet at the moment, the potential for tax reform in 2017 has led some companies to delay deal making, according to Marc Zenner, the co-head of J.P. Morgan\u2019s corporate finance advisory team.\u201cWhat you\u2019ve got right now is a fair bit of uncertainty about what the state of the world will be next year with taxes,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have to do this deal right now, maybe you can wait until next year so you can finance optimally.\u201dStill, some boards appear to believe they may get a better price if they sign a desired deal sooner rather than later. If tax rates decrease, a company\u2019s profitability increases, making it a more expensive acquisition target. And, if all of the repatriating companies go after the same targets, that could drive up the price as well.\u201cWhat people fear is that if everyone waits for clarity on timing and specific tax treatment, the markets could be a lot higher, purely as it relates to this influx of capital,\u201d Peter A. Weinberg, founding partner at Perella Weinberg Partners, said. \u201cDo you commit capital today with the risk of timing, or do you wait for certainty and risk paying more than you would today?\u201dMr. Weinberg said that if there were a significant reduction of the tax rate, companies would bring at least $1 trillion back, an amount large enough to affect the prices of equities and debt.Some companies may not be interested in deal making. Apple, which has the largest overseas cash load, is historically not a big acquirer; its largest purchase was its $3 billion deal for Beats Music and Beats Electronics in 2014. Microsoft, with the second-largest cash hoard, will most likely still be digesting its $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn, announced in June.But these companies will not get away with simply letting the cash sit on their balance sheet unused for too long.\u201cIf the money is coming back, it would be hard to tell investors, \u2018I have access to it and you\u2019re not getting it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Zenner said.A certain class of hedge funds, known as activist investors, have been known to screen for companies with large piles of cash relative to their market valuations. They take large stakes and then push management to use the money for stock buybacks or richer dividends.During the 2004 tax holiday, stock repurchases were a forbidden use of the cash, but that rule proved difficult to enforce. A 2009 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that each dollar of repatriated cash was linked to an increase of 60 to 92 cents in some form of payout to shareholders.There are far more activist investors with billions more in capital to deploy this time. While activists\u2019 assets under management declined slightly this year, they still amount to about $175 billion, 50 percent higher than just four years ago, according to data compiled by the research firm Activist Insight.It is unclear exactly how tax reform under Mr. Trump might look, but many on Wall Street are optimistic about what it means for their clients.\u201cThe potential for these reforms, around reduced corporate tax rates and cash repatriation, to put more discretionary cash flow in the hands of companies is significant,\u201d said Avinash Mehrotra, co-head of Goldman Sachs\u2019s M.&A. shareholder advisory group. \u201cBoards and management teams will have some interesting choices around acquisitions, longer-term capital investments, debt reduction and return of capital.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hans Tietmeyer, Banker Who Led German Transition to Euro, Dies at 85", "Date": "2016-12-28", "News": "Supported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Hans Tietmeyer, the central banker who led Germany\u2019s transition from the deutsche mark to the euro despite reservations about a single European currency, died on Tuesday. He was 85.The Bundesbank, Germany\u2019s central bank, announced his death but did not give the cause or say where he died.As president of the Bundesbank from 1993 until 1999, Mr. Tietmeyer was the most powerful central banker in Europe and a leading advocate of policies that prized price stability above all else. But in contrast to some of his more dogmatic predecessors, he was also known as a politically savvy pragmatist capable of compromise.Mr. Tietmeyer played a leading role in the years of negotiations that preceded the euro. He was among those insisting that countries joining the new currency union should be held to strict spending limits, and that the European Central Bank\u2019s top priority should be to contain inflation.After the Bundesbank and other central banks in the eurozone ceded power over monetary policy to the European Central Bank in 1999, Mr. Tietmeyer remained a visible and influential speaker and commentator. In a 2004 book, \u201cHerausforderung Euro\u201d (\u201cThe Euro Challenge\u201d), he lamented that many countries \u2014 including Germany \u2014 had violated the spending limits he had worked so hard to establish.His views seemed to be vindicated in 2010, when the government of Greece was discovered to have systematically concealed its runaway public debt, provoking a crisis that nearly destroyed the euro and remains a source of tension.Mr. Tietmeyer was born on Aug. 18, 1931, in Metelen, a village northwest of M\u00fcnster close to Germany\u2019s border with the Netherlands. He was one of 11 children of Helene and Bernhard Tietmeyer, a financial inspector for the local government. There was no immediate word on his survivors.When he completed secondary school in 1952, Mr. Tietmeyer initially studied Roman Catholic theology. But after three semesters he switched to economics and went on to earn a doctorate from the University of Cologne in 1960. At the same time, he became expert at table tennis, winning medals at national championships.In 1962, Mr. Tietmeyer took a post at the West German Ministry of Economics, beginning a long career in Civil Service, often in jobs that involved coordinating economic policy with other European countries.As European leaders were beginning to discuss the idea of a common currency, Mr. Tietmeyer, in 1982, became a state secretary in the Finance Ministry, a position just below the minister. The job included responsibility for issues related to what was then known as the European Community. In that role, he became a close adviser to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, preparing for West German participation in international summits.Mr. Tietmeyer was powerful enough to become a target of terrorists. In 1988, members of the far-left Red Army Faction fired at his Mercedes-Benz outside Bonn, striking the car numerous times but leaving Mr. Tietmeyer and his driver uninjured.Mr. Kohl\u2019s government nominated Mr. Tietmeyer to the Bundesbank\u2019s board in 1990, and he became president three years later.After his retirement from the Bundesbank, he remained something of a spiritual godfather to German economists and policy makers who have insisted \u2014 to much international criticism \u2014 that fiscal austerity is the cure for countries, like Greece, with too much government debt.\u201cMonetary stability is not everything,\u201d Mr. Tietmeyer said in a 2008 speech, \u201cbut without it there is nothing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Government Shutdown Looms Over Stopgap Spending Measure", "Date": "2016-12-08", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The House voted overwhelmingly on Thursday to finance the government through late April, but a snag over the measure in the Senate threatens a shutdown of operations this weekend.With Congress on the cusp of wrapping up its lame-duck session, Senate Democrats picked fights on behalf of two constituencies to whom President-elect Donald J. Trump appealed during his campaign \u2014 coal miners and steel workers.The stopgap spending measure must be approved by the Senate by midnight Friday to keep the government open. But Democrats in the Senate, led by Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, are objecting because they want a better deal for thousands of retired coal miners who are set to lose their health benefits at the end of the year.The spending bill extends the miners\u2019 health coverage for only four months, which the Democrats view as insufficient.\u201cWe can do the right thing between today and tomorrow,\u201d Mr. Manchin said on the Senate floor on Thursday afternoon, imploring his colleagues to stand with the miners.The House finished its work for the year on Thursday. If Democrats move to slow down approval of the spending measure over the issue, it could lead to a shutdown of the government beginning on Saturday.Republicans on Thursday were not sympathetic to the Democrats\u2019 case.\u201cThey\u2019re not going to get what they want,\u201d said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the chamber\u2019s No. 2 Republican. \u201cThey ought to actually be grateful for what they got.\u201dAlso uncertain on Thursday was the fate of $170 million to help Flint, Mich., and other communities dealing with water contamination.That funding was included in the stopgap spending bill. But the money for Flint relied on the approval of a second piece of legislation, a water projects bill that the House passed on Thursday but that faced resistance in the Senate, too.Senate Democrats were unhappy about the removal of language that would have written into law a permanent requirement that American-made steel and iron be used for water infrastructure projects.The House voted 326 to 96 to approve the spending measure, which funds the government through April 28.The measure includes language that would speed up the consideration of a waiver that James N. Mattis, a retired general who is Mr. Trump\u2019s pick for defense secretary, needs in order to serve in that position.Federal law requires a seven-year waiting period between active duty and serving as defense secretary, and General Mattis retired from the Marines in 2013.The spending bill does not give the waiver to General Mattis, but lays a path for the swift consideration early next year of legislation granting one.\u201cThat should not be in this bill,\u201d said Representative Louise M. Slaughter, a Democrat from upstate New York, adding that civilian control of the military was \u201cone of the pillars of our democracy.\u201dThe spending bill also contains $7 million to reimburse law enforcement for overtime associated with protecting the president-elect, whose residence at Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan has created security headaches that have come with a considerable cost.Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York wanted $35 million, which his administration estimates will be the cost incurred by the city between the election and the inauguration.\u201cWe are counting on Congress to step up in the coming months to pay back what it owes our city,\u201d the mayor, a Democrat, said in a statement after the spending bill was released this week. \u201cThis is a national responsibility, and the burden cannot fall alone on our city and police department.\u201dJennifer Steinhauer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Michael Lewis, the Story of Two Friends Who Changed How We Think About the Way We Think", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byNonfictionIn the fall of 1969, behind the closed door of an otherwise empty seminar room at Hebrew University, two psychologists began a collaboration that would upend the understanding of human behavior. Those first conversations were filled with uproarious laughter and occasional shouting, in a jumble of Hebrew and English, which could sometimes be heard from the hallway.When it came time for the two professors to write up their papers, they would sit next to each other at a single typewriter. \u201cWe were sharing a mind,\u201d one would say later. They flipped a coin to decide whose name would appear first on their initial paper and alternated thereafter. The two names were Amos Tversky \u2014 the winner of that coin flip \u2014 and Daniel Kahneman.Their work revealed previously undiscovered patterns of human irrationality: the ways that our minds consistently fool us and the steps we can take, at least some of the time, to avoid being fooled. Kahneman and Tversky used the word \u201cheuristics\u201d to describe the rules of thumb that often lead people astray. One such rule is the \u201chalo effect,\u201d in which thinking about one positive attribute of a person or thing causes observers to perceive other strengths that aren\u2019t really there. Another is \u201crepresentativeness,\u201d which leads people to see cause and effect \u2014 to see a \u201cnarrative\u201d \u2014 where they should instead accept uncertainty or randomness.The research of Kahneman and Tversky has become some of the most influential social science of the past century. It has helped to reorder economics by exposing the folly of economists\u2019 belief in an unconsciously rational human mind. The work has also led to advances in medical diagnosis and patient behavior. It has affected eating habits, cellphone use by drivers, retirement savings and many other areas.The work is also full of practical little ideas. \u201cNo one ever made a decision because of a number,\u201d Kahneman has said. \u201cThey need a story.\u201d Or Tversky\u2019s theory of socializing: Because stinginess and generosity are both contagious, and because behaving generously makes you happier, surround yourself with generous people.One of the clearest places to see their work\u2019s impact, although surely not the most important, is professional sports. Team executives have realized that some of their long-held assumptions about what makes a great athlete or a winning strategy turn out to be wrong. And they have adjusted. The adjustments have not always worked, and many of the old beliefs \u2014 say, the importance of fielding skill among catchers in baseball \u2014 contain wisdom. Yet the reformist movement has had many more wins than losses. One reformer is Theo Epstein, the executive who has overseen the demise of mythical curses on both the Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs.The changes in sports are known as the Moneyball revolution, after the title of a 2003 book by Michael Lewis, about the low-budget success of the Oakland Athletics. One review of \u201cMoneyball\u201d particularly caught Lewis\u2019s eye, because it offered a criticism that had not occurred to him. Writing in The New Republic, two academics \u2014 Richard Thaler, an economist who had helped overthrow his field\u2019s hyperrationality, and Cass Sunstein, a law professor \u2014 argued that Lewis had missed a larger story: The success of the A\u2019s could trace its intellectual roots not only through the world of baseball\u2019s analytical geeks but also back to the work of Kahneman and Tversky.\u201cUntil that moment I don\u2019t believe I\u2019d ever heard of either Kahneman or Tversky,\u201d Lewis now writes. \u201cMy book wasn\u2019t original. It was simply an illustration of ideas that had been floating around for decades and had yet to be fully appreciated by, among others, me.\u201d Lewis set about learning more about the psychologists, and the result is his latest book, \u201cThe Undoing Project,\u201d a joint biography of Kahneman and Tversky, and a discussion of their ideas and complex relationship.Lewis is the ideal teller of the story. Dating to his 1989 debut, \u201cLiar\u2019s Poker,\u201d about the Wall Street boom of that decade, he has displayed a rare combination for a writer. He immerses himself in big ideas \u2014 about finance, technology, sports and, ultimately, the human condition \u2014 and then explains them to readers with sophistication and clarity. But he is also a vastly better raconteur than most other writers playing the explication game. You laugh when you read his books. You see his protagonists in three dimensions \u2014 deeply likable, but also flawed, just like most of your friends and family.Kahneman and Tversky are no longer obscure figures, thanks in part to Kahneman\u2019s best-selling \u201cThinking, Fast and Slow.\u201d Yet their story is still not well known. They were both grandsons of rabbis from Eastern Europe, and both atheists. They were deeply affected by their service in the Israeli military \u2014 including in the 1973 Yom Kippur War, after they had already established themselves as academics. The experiences helped make Kahneman far more practical than he otherwise might have been, because he understood that psychology could save, or cost, lives.For Tversky, military service sharpened the brazenness that became crucial to their collaboration. At one time, against the orders of a superior, he rushed over to a fellow soldier who had collapsed near an unexploded grenade and pulled the soldier to safety. \u201cOnce I did that,\u201d he later told a friend, \u201cI felt obliged to keep this image of hero.\u201d His confidence and brilliance combined to make for a cutting sense of humor. After he had given a talk, an English statistician approached him and said, \u201cI don\u2019t usually like Jews, but I like you.\u201d Tversky responded, \u201cI usually like Englishmen, but I don\u2019t like you.\u201dTversky\u2019s panache made him the more prominent of the pair, by a considerable margin, while they were doing their work. The gap aggravated tensions that existed between the two men despite what Lewis describes as a platonic love between them. Many of today\u2019s readers, of course, know only Kahneman\u2019s name. The back story is tragically affecting: Tversky died of cancer in 1996, at the age of 59. He received the diagnosis just after he and Kahneman had severed their friendship, only to repair it in Tversky\u2019s last months.For all of the personal anguish that their differences created, those differences also fueled their accomplishments. Tversky\u2019s boldness helped the pair to take on strongly held beliefs in one field after another. Kahneman\u2019s humility and insecurity were just as important to their success. He was unsparingly self-critical, which allowed him to understand his own mental errors \u2014 and, by extension, to diagnose widespread human errors that others had missed. Kahneman came to realize that when he was faced with results from studying 40 subjects, a typical sample in psychology, his instinct was to devise an explanation for the results. In truth, the most likely explanation was statistical noise.If you want to conduct your own experiment along these lines, ask someone to write down the results of a hypothetical sequence of 20 coin flips. Then ask the person to flip a coin 20 times and write down the results. The actual flips will almost certainly contain long streaks of only heads or tails \u2014 the sort of streaks that people don\u2019t think a random coin produces on its own. This kind of misconception leads us to misanalyze all sorts of situations, in business, politics and everyday life. Lewis, describing one of Kahneman and Tversky\u2019s real-life disciples, writes, \u201cHe suggested a new definition of the nerd: a person who knows his own mind well enough to mistrust it.\u201dThat notion \u2014 reflected in the book\u2019s title \u2014 is one of the most important that Lewis offers, especially now. Many people attracted to Kahneman and Tversky\u2019s ideas have a little bit of Amos Tversky\u2019s brashness in them. They (in fairness, I should say \u201cwe\u201d) get some enjoyment from puncturing shibboleths with data and observation. As a result, they are often seen as arrogant and sometimes are indeed arrogant.I read \u201cThe Undoing Project\u201d during the final days of the 2016 presidential campaign and its aftermath. In many ways, the campaign\u2019s result and its winner represented the antitheses of Kahneman and Tversky\u2019s work. The election was a victory for gut instinct over empiricism, for cynicism over reason.But the full message of Kahneman and Tversky\u2019s work, I think, is more subtle than it often seems \u2014 and even more important in the new political world than the old. The human species is fantastically complex and often doesn\u2019t know what it is doing. The search for a better understanding of our behavior is vital. It\u2019s also difficult, never-ending and still very much worth the struggle.David Leonhardt is an Op-Ed columnist for The Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rebuffing Israel, U.S. Allows Censure Over Settlements", "Date": "2016-12-23", "News": "Supported byThe administration\u2019s decision not to veto the measure reflected its accumulated frustration over Israeli settlements. The American abstention on the vote also broke a longstanding policy of shielding Israel from action at the United Nations that described the settlements as illegal.While the resolution is not expected to have any practical impact on the ground, it is regarded as a major rebuff to Israel, one that could increase its isolation over the paralyzed peace process with Israel\u2019s Palestinian neighbors, who have sought to establish their own state on territory held by Israel.Applause broke out in the 15-member Security Council\u2019s chambers after the vote on the measure, which passed 14 to 0, with the United States ambassador, Samantha Power, raising her hand as the lone abstention. Israel\u2019s ambassador, Danny Danon, denounced the measure, and castigated the council members who had approved it.\u201cWould you ban the French from building in Paris?\u201d he told them.The resolution describes the settlement building as a \u201cmajor obstacle\u201d to peace and demands that Israel stop the construction, which most the world regards as illegal.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who had scrambled in recent days to stop the measure from coming to a vote, issued a blistering denunciation afterward.\u201cIsrael rejects this shameful anti-Israel resolution at the U.N. and will not abide by its terms,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said in a statement. \u201cAt a time when the Security Council does nothing to stop the slaughter of half a million people in Syria, it disgracefully gangs up on the one true democracy in the Middle East, Israel, and calls the Western Wall \u2018occupied territory.\u2019 \u201dMr. Netanyahu immediately retaliated against two of the countries that sponsored the resolution. He ordered Israel\u2019s ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal to return home for consultations, canceled a planned visit to Israel next month by Senegal\u2019s foreign minister and cut off all aid programs to Senegal.A United Nations Security Council draft resolution condemning Israel\u2019s settlement building.The Obama administration has been highly critical of Israel\u2019s settlement building, describing it as an impediment to a two-state solution in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that has long been the official United States position, regardless of the party in power.Mr. Trump, who had urged the administration to veto the resolution, has made clear that he will take a far more sympathetic approach to Israel when his administration assumes office on Jan. 20.A range of senators and congressmen from both parties also denounced the resolution, a reflection of the deep loyalty to Israel shared by Democrats and Republicans. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York said, \u201cIt is extremely frustrating, disappointing and confounding that the administration has failed to veto this resolution.\u201dOther groups that have grown increasingly critical of the Israeli government\u2019s approach to the peace process applauded the resolution and the Obama administration\u2019s decision not to block it.Ms. Power, the United States ambassador, portrayed the abstention as consistent with the American disapproval of settlement-building, but she also criticized countries at the United Nations for treating Israel unfairly. She said the United States remained committed to its \u201csteadfast support\u201d for Israel and reminded the council that Israel received an enormous amount of American military aid.\u201cToday the Security Council reaffirmed its established consensus that settlements have no legal validity,\u201d she said. \u201cThe United States has been sending a message that settlements must stop privately and publicly for nearly five decades.\u201dShe also rebuked Palestinian leaders for \u201ctoo often\u201d failing to condemn violence against Israeli civilians. But she directed a portion of her remarks to Mr. Netanyahu, whose relations with the Obama administration have never been warm.\u201cOne cannot simultaneously champion expanding Israeli settlements and champion a viable two-state solution that would end the conflict,\u201d she said, arguing that the settlements have undermined Israel\u2019s security.Israel\u2019s ambassador, Mr. Danon, who had exhorted the American delegation to block the measure, expressed his anger in a statement that looked forward to a change in policy under Mr. Trump.\u201cIt was to be expected that Israel\u2019s greatest ally would act in accordance with the values that we share and that they would have vetoed this disgraceful resolution,\u201d he said.Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, welcomed the resolution\u2019s adoption but tempered his approval with a warning. \u201cIn reality, today\u2019s action may be too little too late,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter years of allowing the law to be trampled and the situation to spiral downward, today\u2019s resolution may rightly be seen as a last attempt to preserve the two-state solution and revive the path for peace.\u201dThe resolution also included a nod to Israel and its backers by condemning \u201call acts of violence against civilians, including acts of terror, as well as all acts of provocation, incitement and destruction.\u201d That language is diplomatic scolding aimed at Palestinian leaders, whom Israel accuses of encouraging attacks on Israeli civilians.Hamas, the Palestinian group that controls the Gaza Strip and is deemed a terrorist organization by the United States and Israel, expressed appreciation to the Security Council. \u201cWe praise the countries that voted for the resolution,\u201d said Hazem Kassem, a spokesman for the group. \u201cWe emphasize the need to turn such a resolution into action, not only to halt settlements but to eradicate Israel\u2019s occupation in all its forms.\u201dPeter Baker contributed reporting from Jerusalem, and Mark Landler from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Indonesia\u2019s Dire Need for Engineers Is Going Unmet", "Date": "2016-12-18", "News": "Supported byMemo From IndonesiaJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 Like many college students, Abdul Hamid is not thinking too much about life after graduation.After all, Mr. Hamid, 20, is only in his sophomore year at the Syarif Hidayatullah State Islamic University, outside Jakarta, the Indonesian capital. He spends his days at the university\u2019s Faculty of Islamic Theology, where he majors in comparative religious studies, and his evenings hanging out with friends and listening to music.Pressed about his postcollege plans, Mr. Hamid shrugged and smiled. \u201cInshallah, teaching,\u201d he said, using the Arabic word for \u201cGod willing.\u201d \u201cMost students in my field go on to teach young people at Islamic boarding schools.\u201dBut while that may be an honorable vocation in the world\u2019s most populous Muslim-majority nation, more religion teachers are not what Indonesia needs, say education experts, economists and business leaders here.They say the country has a shortage of skilled workers \u2014 in fields ranging from medical services to agriculture \u2014 and will need tens of millions more in the coming decades. It particularly needs more engineers, a problem that could thwart President Joko Widodo\u2019s ambitious plans to upgrade Indonesia\u2019s outdated infrastructure.\u201cThere\u2019s a whole range of professionals where there are problems,\u201d said Christopher Manning, a retired economics professor at Australian National University in Canberra, who has researched Indonesia\u2019s economy for decades. \u201cIf you talk to any multinational corporations, there are questions about managers. There are questions about engineers.\u201dYet of Indonesia\u2019s six million university and postgraduate students, as many as 20 percent are majoring in Islamic studies, according to the Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education. And those graduates often don\u2019t find work in their chosen field.\u201cThe problem is quality skills and productivity,\u201d said Eko Prasetyo, president director of the Education Fund Management Institution, an arm of the Indonesian Ministry of Finance that has awarded more than 15,000 postgraduate scholarships since 2013.\u201cWe have to produce more engineers. We have to produce more researchers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t just be an economy led by natural resources.\u201dAfter President Joko took office in 2014, his administration declared a dozen priority fields of study for state-funded scholarships, including information technology, nursing and tourism. But Mr. Joko, a socially conservative Muslim, included religious studies among those fields, even though it was already a popular choice for students.Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific chief economist for IHS Economics, which is based in London, said that producing more skilled workers, including engineers and technicians, should be \u201cone of the key strategic priorities for the Indonesian government over the next decade.\u201d\u201cIndonesia is estimated to have an annual shortage of around 30,000 engineering graduates per year, and this is a key hurdle to infrastructure development and the growth of the manufacturing industry,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Indonesian government needs to give a high priority to developing educational infrastructure to address these skill shortages, including universities for science and engineering as well as technical institutes.\u201dThe country is estimated to have 57 million skilled workers now, and would need 113 million by 2030 based on current growth rates, Mr. Biswas said.The challenge is a daunting one. Fewer than 10 percent of Indonesia\u2019s 250 million people have a university-level education, according to a 2015 national labor force survey conducted by the Indonesian Central Statistics Bureau. Most Indonesians who do have university degrees work as teachers, according to data from the Asian Development Bank. Just 8 percent are engineers.Analysts say this imbalance of professional talent is hampering Mr. Joko\u2019s government as he attempts, with great fanfare, to carry out hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of nationwide infrastructure projects, ranging from sea and airports to highways and new power plants.One of his ambitious goals is to create an additional 35,000 megawatts of electricity supply through new coal-fired plants by 2019, a big stretch that is now in its second year. But there is apprehension among business leaders about whether the government can pull it off.\u201cWhen they enter the construction phase, they will face this shortage of engineers. The question becomes: Where do those engineers come from?\u201d said Heru Dewanto, president director of Cirebon Power, which operates six power plants in West Java Province and is building a seventh.More than half of the engineering graduates produced by Indonesia go on to careers in other fields, like banking, said Mr. Heru, who is vice president of the Institution of Engineers Indonesia. \u201cWhy? Because those jobs provide better incomes,\u201d he said.The same is true of graduates in many areas, including Islamic studies. Ainun Na\u2019im, secretary general of the higher education ministry, said nearly half of Islamic studies graduates ended up in occupations unrelated to religion, like communications and public relations. And Indonesian graduates in a variety of fields take unrelated jobs not because they pay more, but because they cannot find work in their chosen profession.\u201cThis occurs when, for example, a university graduate qualifies to be an accountant but can\u2019t find a job in that area, so rather than be unemployed they become a taxi driver,\u201d said Emma R. Allen, a country economist for the Asian Development Bank in Jakarta.Such \u201chigh levels of mismatch are typically associated with weak labor productivity growth and slow transition to higher-value activities throughout the economy,\u201d Ms. Allen said.The problems with the country\u2019s educational system go deep. Just 43 percent of Indonesians have completed primary school, according to the government\u2019s statistics bureau. A June study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that looked at 34 countries found that Indonesians working in Jakarta scored last in literacy, numeracy and problem solving.The situation is improving. For instance, in 2015, 57 percent of Indonesians who finished primary school went on to continue their studies, compared with 40 percent in 2002, according to government figures. And the proportion of college-age Indonesians attending universities has risen to 25 percent from 20 percent in the past decade. But analysts say much more is needed.\u201cIn terms of quantity, that\u2019s a lot of achievement,\u201d said Sutarum Wiryono, an education senior project officer at the Asian Development Bank. \u201cBut in terms of quality, it is not.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Trump\u2019s Education Nominee Bent Detroit to Her Will on Charter Schools", "Date": "2016-12-12", "News": "Supported bySo city leaders across the political spectrum agreed on a fix, with legislation to provide oversight and set standards on how to open schools and close bad ones.Her resistance to the legislation last spring is a window into Ms. DeVos\u2019s philosophy and what she might bring to the fierce and often partisan debate about public education across the country, and in particular, the roles of choice and charter schools.The bill\u2019s proposals are common in many states and accepted by many supporters of school choice, like a provision to stop failing charter operators from creating new schools. But Ms. DeVos argued that this kind of oversight would create too much bureaucracy and limit choice. A believer in a freer market than even some free market economists would endorse, Ms. DeVos pushed back on any regulation as too much regulation. Charter schools should be allowed to operate as they wish; parents would judge with their feet.Detroit Public Schools, she argued, should simply be shut down and the system turned over to charters, or the tax dollars given to parents in the form of vouchers to attend private schools.\u201cIf she was showing herself present in places and learning from the practitioners, that\u2019s a fine combination,\u201d Ms. Allen said. \u201cBut Betsy never showed up in Detroit. She was very eager to impose experimentation on students that she has not spent time with and children that she does not have consequence for.\u201dMs. DeVos declined to be interviewed. But her allies say her views have been misinterpreted.Hers was a different version of choice, quality and accountability, however, than that envisioned by those who drafted and supported the legislation: a broad coalition of charter school and teachers\u2019 union leaders, the Detroit chamber of commerce and some of the city\u2019s most prominent Republican philanthropists and politicians, its Democratic mayor and the state\u2019s Republican governor.\u201cThe misinformation campaign was horrendous,\u201d said Thomas Stallworth III, a former state legislator who lobbied on behalf of the coalition. And the sway of her contributions was too much to overcome. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we could compete with that. We don\u2019t have those kinds of resources.\u201dMs. DeVos and her husband had lobbied hard for the state law that established charter schools in 1994. It allowed an unusually large number of organizations to start charter schools, which are publicly funded but privately run. But it created little oversight.In 2011, the DeVoses and the Great Lakes project lobbied successfully to lift a cap on the number of charter schools, fighting off a provision that would have kept failing schools from expanding.Traditional and charter schools alike compete with televisions, laptops and bicycles for students \u2014 and the taxpayer dollars that follow them. More than 150 schools have opened or closed in the last seven years, and it is not unusual to find students who change schools every year, and teachers who do so more often than that.With more than a dozen organizations issuing charters, it is hard for parents to get the information they need to inform their choices. And, in a city of 140 square miles, the highest-performing schools usually remain out of reach to the poorest students, because most schools do not offer transportation, and the city bus service is unreliable.Most charters have failed to improve on the dismal performance of the traditional public schools. High-performing national charter networks have stayed away because of the instability of the market. The Walton Family Foundation, which has committed $1 billion over the next five years to expanding charters and choice, similarly withdrew its money from Detroit earlier this year.The legislation proposed earlier this year by Goeff Hansen, a Republican state senator, would have paid off the debt of the city\u2019s traditional public schools, which were on the brink of bankruptcy, and returned control of those schools from the state to a locally elected school board.School operators that earned below an A or B could not expand without the commission\u2019s signing off on their location. Schools that earned an F three years in a row could be closed.Leaders of 20 charter schools in Detroit, including some of the highest-performing, made a last-ditch effort to urge the Legislature to adopt the commission. \u201cWe have to be looking at every possible way to expand the choices and the opportunities in the neighborhoods for families,\u201d Clark Durant, a onetime Republican candidate for the United States Senate and the co-founder of a network of schools, said at a news conference alongside Mayor Mike Duggan. \u201cAnd I believe this is the beginning of that effort.\u201dThe legislation passed the State Senate. But in the House of Representatives, support fell away, as leaders of the Republican caucus reminded the members of how much financial support the DeVoses could withhold.They warned that the DeVoses would finance primary challenges against Republicans who defied her, as they had done to one who voted against the bill to lift the cap on charter schools five years earlier.The DeVoses, said Representative Dave Pagel, a Republican who supported the commission, \u201cmade arguments that were strongly heard, and they prevailed.\u201dThe House passed a bill that never included the language establishing the commission. The bill paid off the debt of Detroit Public Schools and returned the city\u2019s traditional public schools to local control. And it will allow the state to close the schools at the bottom of existing state rankings, which Mr. Naeyaert said was proof that Ms. DeVos supported measures to ensure quality.But that will mean shutting down mostly traditional public schools, which in Detroit serve the neediest students, and further desert students in neighborhoods where charters have largely declined to go.\u201cMy complaint around this is not that you disagree,\u201d said Ms. Allen, at the Skillman Foundation, \u201cbut that you never could come up with another solution to deal with the practical issues of poor public policy that is not only eroding a traditional school system, but eroding all schools.\u201dNoam Scheiber contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How the Obama Coalition Crumbled, Leaving an Opening for Trump", "Date": "2016-12-23", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceIt is entirely possible, as many have argued, that Hillary Clinton would be the president-elect of the United States if the F.B.I. director, James Comey, had not sent a letter to Congress about her emails in the last weeks of the campaign.It was clear from the start that Mrs. Clinton was struggling to reassemble the Obama coalition.At every point of the race, Mr. Trump was doing better among white voters without a college degree than Mitt Romney did in 2012 \u2014 by a wide margin. Mrs. Clinton was also not matching Mr. Obama\u2019s support among black voters.This was the core of the Obama coalition: an alliance between black voters and Northern white voters, from Mr. Obama\u2019s first win in the 2008 Iowa caucuses to his final sprint across the so-called Midwestern Firewall states where he staked his 2012 re-election bid.In 2016, the Obama coalition crumbled and so did the Midwestern Firewall.The countryside of Iowa or the industrial belt along Lake Erie is not the sort of place that people envision when they think of the Obama coalition. Yet it was an important component of his victory.Campaign lore has it that President Obama won thanks to a young, diverse, well-educated and metropolitan \u201ccoalition of the ascendant\u201d \u2014 an emerging Democratic majority anchored in the new economy. Hispanic voters, in particular, were credited with Mr. Obama\u2019s victory.But Mr. Obama would have won re-election even if he hadn\u2019t won the Hispanic vote at all. He would have won even if the electorate had been as old and as white as it had been in 2004.He excelled in a nearly continuous swath from the Pacific Coast of Oregon and Washington to the Red River Valley in Minnesota, along the Great Lakes to the coast of Maine. In these places, Mr. Obama often ran as strong or stronger than any Democrat in history.In 2016, Mr. Trump made huge gains among white working-class voters. It wasn\u2019t just in the places where Democratic strength had been eroding for a long time, like western Pennsylvania. It was often in the places where Democrats had seemed resilient or even strong, like Scranton, Pa., and eastern Iowa.It was a decisive break from recent trends. White voters without college degrees, for the first time, deviated from the national trend and swung decidedly toward the Republicans. No bastion of white, working-class Democratic strength was immune to the trend.For the first time in the history of the two parties, the Republican candidate did better among low-income whites than among affluent whites, according to exit poll data and a compilation of New York Times/CBS News surveys.According to exit polls, Mr. Trump did better than Mr. Romney by 24 points among white voters without a degree making less than $30,000 a year. He won these voters by a margin of 62 to 30 percent, compared with Mr. Romney\u2019s narrow win of 52 percent to 45 percent.In general, exit poll data should be interpreted with caution \u2014 but pre-election polls show a similar swing, and the magnitude of the shifts most likely withstands any failings of the exit polls.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s profound weakness among Northern white working-class voters was not expected as recently as six months ago. She was thought to be fairly strong among the older white working-class voters who were skeptical of Mr. Obama from the start. Most of Mr. Obama\u2019s strength among white voters without a degree was due to his gains among those under age 45.But Mr. Trump expanded on Republican gains among older working-class white voters, according to Upshot estimates, while erasing most of Mr. Obama\u2019s gains among younger Northern white voters without a degree.His gains among younger working-class whites were especially important in the Upper Midwest. Young white working-class voters represent a larger share of the vote there than anywhere else in the country. Mr. Obama\u2019s strength among them \u2014 and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s weakness \u2014 was evident from the beginning of the 2008 primaries.Mr. Trump\u2019s gains among white working-class voters weren\u2019t simply caused by Democrats staying home on Election Day.The Clinton team knew what was wrong from the start, according to a Clinton campaign staffer and other Democrats. Its models, based on survey data, indicated that they were underperforming Mr. Obama in less-educated white areas by a wide margin \u2014 perhaps 10 points or more \u2014 as early as the summer.The campaign looked back to respondents who were contacted in 2012, and found a large number of white working-class voters who had backed Mr. Obama were now supporting Mr. Trump.The same story was obvious in public polls of registered voters. Those polls aren\u2019t affected by changes in turnout.The best data on the effect of turnout will ultimately come from voter file data, which will include an individual-level account of who voted and who didn\u2019t. Most of this data is only beginning to become available.But the limited data that\u2019s already available is consistent with the story evident in the pre-election polling: Turnout wasn\u2019t the major factor driving shifts among white voters.The voter-file data in North Carolina, where nearly all of the state\u2019s jurisdictions have reported their vote, shows that the turnout among white Democrats and Republicans increased by almost the exact amount \u2014 about 2.5 percent. The same appears to be true in Florida.Nationally, there is no relationship between the decline in Democratic strength and the change in turnout. Mr. Trump made gains in white working-class areas, whether turnout surged or dropped.The exit polls also show all of the signs that Mr. Trump was winning over Obama voters. Perhaps most strikingly, Mr. Trump won 19 percent of white voters without a degree who approved of Mr. Obama\u2019s performance, including 8 percent of those who \u201cstrongly\u201d approved of Mr. Obama\u2019s performance and 10 percent of white working-class voters who wanted to continue Mr. Obama\u2019s policies.Mr. Trump won 20 percent of self-identified liberal white working-class voters, according to the exit polls, and 38 percent of those who wanted policies that were more liberal than Mr. Obama\u2019s.It strongly suggests that Mr. Trump won over large numbers of white, working-class voters who supported Mr. Obama four years earlier.The notion that Mr. Trump could win over so many people who voted for Mr. Obama and who still approved of his performance is hard to understand for people with ideologically consistent views on a traditional liberal-conservative spectrum. Mr. Trump, if anything, was Mr. Obama\u2019s opposite.But the two had the same winning pitch to white working-class voters.Mr. Obama and his campaign team portrayed Mr. Romney as a plutocrat who dismantled companies and outsourced jobs. The implication was that he would leave middle-class jobs prey to globalization and corporations.There was one place where Mr. Romney was able to effectively argue that he could protect the industrial economy and the people who worked in it: coal country. There he made big gains after the Obama administration pushed climate-change policies that would reduce the production and use of coal.In retrospect, the scale of the Democratic collapse in coal country was a harbinger of just how far the Democrats would fall in their old strongholds once they forfeited the mantle of working-class interests.Mr. Trump owned Mr. Obama\u2019s winning message to autoworkers and Mr. Romney\u2019s message to coal country. He didn\u2019t merely run to protect the remnants of the industrial economy; he promised to restore it and \u201cmake America great again.\u201dJust as Mr. Obama\u2019s team caricatured Mr. Romney, Mr. Trump caricatured Mrs. Clinton as a tool of Wall Street, bought by special interests. She, too, would leave workers vulnerable to the forces of globalization and big business, he said.Like Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump ran against the establishment \u2014 and against a candidate who embodied it far more than John McCain or Mr. Romney did. The various allegations against Mrs. Clinton neatly complemented the notion that she wasn\u2019t out to help ordinary Americans.Taken together, Mr. Trump\u2019s views on immigration, trade, China, crime, guns and Islam all had considerable appeal to white working-class Democratic voters, according to Pew Research data. It was a far more appealing message than old Republican messages about abortion, same-sex marriage and the social safety net.None of this is to say that changes in turnout didn\u2019t help Mr. Trump at all. It\u2019s just not the reason he made such large gains among white working-class voters.There was no relationship between the change in Democratic support and the change in turnout, or the change in turnout and Democratic strength.But the Democrats did have a turnout problem in November. It wasn\u2019t a broad Democratic turnout problem. It was a black turnout problem.The turnout probably increased among all major groups of voters \u2014 Hispanics, white Democrats, white Republicans \u2014 except black voters.The conclusive data is available in the Southern states where voters indicate their race on their voter registration forms, and they point toward a considerable decline in black turnout.In Georgia, the black share of the electorate fell to 27.6 percent from 29.9 percent, and in Louisiana it fell to 28.5 percent from 30.1 percent, according to the completed state turnout data.The data is not yet final in North Carolina, but the black share of the electorate looks unlikely to reach 21 percent of voters \u2014 down from 23 percent in 2012. The data is even less complete in Florida, but there too it appears that black turnout will fall by a similar amount \u2014 perhaps to 12.7 percent of voters from 14 percent.In all of these states, the black share of the electorate is still poised to be higher than it was in 2004. It just wasn\u2019t as high as it was with Mr. Obama at the top of the ticket.Young black voters appear to be a key driver of the decline. They registered at a lower rate than they did ahead of the 2012 and 2008 presidential elections, causing the black share of registered voters to dip. And those who were registered turned out at a far lower rate than black registrants did four years ago.The data is not so authoritative elsewhere in the country, but it tells a similar story.Turnout dropped by 8 percent in the majority black wards of Philadelphia, while rising everywhere else in the city.The turnout in Detroit fell by 14 percent. Turnout fell in other industrial centers with a large black population, like Milwaukee and Flint, Mich. It\u2019s hard to know just how much of this is lower black turnout instead of black population decline \u2014 the census can struggle to make population estimates in places with a declining population \u2014 but the turnout certainly dropped faster than the reported population decline.Taken in totality, it appears that black turnout dropped somewhere between 5 percent and 10 percent \u2014 with few exceptions. It should be noted that the decline in black turnout appears very consistent across the country, regardless of whether states put in new laws that might reduce turnout, like those cutting early voting or requiring a photo ID.Was the decline in black turnout enough to change the result of the election? It seems so. If black turnout had matched 2012 levels, Mrs. Clinton would have almost certainly scratched out wins in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Florida and North Carolina would have been extremely close.But pinning Mrs. Clinton\u2019s loss on low black turnout would probably be a mistake. Mr. Obama would have easily won both his elections with this level of black turnout and support. (He would have won Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin each time even if Detroit, Cleveland and Milwaukee had been severed from their states and cast adrift into the Great Lakes.)Perhaps more important, the Clinton campaign\u2019s models and public polls all assumed lower black turnout \u2014 and still showed Mrs. Clinton on track for victory.The Clinton campaign believed it could compensate for the loss of the Obama coalition by winning the so-called \u201crising American electorate\u201d or \u201ccoalition of the ascendant\u201d of well-educated voters and Hispanic voters \u2014 a caricature of the Obama coalition.These demographic shifts have benefited Democrats over the last decade, but most of these gains have come in noncompetitive states.According to the exit polls, Mrs. Clinton fared a tad worse among white voters \u2014 but much worse among Hispanic, Asian-American and black voters than Mr. Obama. And those polls said she didn\u2019t win well-educated white voters, as many pre-election polls indicated.But the preliminary Upshot analysis of voting returns, census and pre-election polling data suggests that Mrs. Clinton was stronger among well-educated white and nonwhite voters than the exit polls imply.It is important to emphasize that these estimates are preliminary. They will change over the next few years with more data from the Census Bureau and additional polling. But it nonetheless paints an alternative picture that\u2019s more consistent with the actual results, pre-election polls and the consensus of academics and campaign analysts on the electorate.The Upshot estimates suggest that Mrs. Clinton really might have become the first Democrat to win white voters with a college degree (although it is very possible that Mr. Obama did so in 2008 as well).Mrs. Clinton\u2019s gains were concentrated among the most affluent and best-educated white voters, much as Mr. Trump\u2019s gains were concentrated among the lowest-income and least-educated white voters.She gained 17 points among white postgraduates, according to Upshot estimates, but just four points among whites with a bachelor\u2019s degree.There was a similar pattern by income. Over all, she picked up 24 points among white voters with a degree making more than $250,000, according to the exit polls, while she made only slight gains among those making less than $100,000 per year.These gains helped her win huge margins in the most well-educated and prosperous liberal bastions of the new economy, like Manhattan, Silicon Valley, Washington, Seattle, Chicago and Boston. There, Mrs. Clinton ran up huge margins in traditionally liberal enclaves and stamped out nearly every last wealthy precinct that supported the Republicans.Scarsdale, N.Y., voted for Mrs. Clinton by 57 points, up from Mr. Obama\u2019s 18-point win. You could drive a full 30 miles through the leafy suburbs northwest of Boston before reaching a town where Mr. Trump hit 20 percent of the vote. She won the affluent east-side suburbs of Seattle, like Mercer Island, Bellevue and Issaquah, by around 50 points \u2014 doubling Mr. Obama\u2019s victory.Every old-money Republican enclave of western Connecticut, like Darien and Greenwich, voted for Mrs. Clinton, in some cases swinging 30 points in her direction. Every precinct of Winnetka and Glencoe, Ill., went to Mrs. Clinton as well.Her gains were nearly as impressive in affluent Republican suburbs, like those edging west of Kansas City, Mo., and Houston; north of Atlanta, Dallas and Columbus, Ohio; or south of Charlotte, N.C., and Los Angeles in Orange County. Mrs. Clinton didn\u2019t always win these affluent Republican enclaves, but she made big gains.But the narrowness of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s gains among well-educated voters helped to concentrate her support in the coasts and the prosperous but safely Republican Sun Belt. It left her short in middle-class, battleground-state suburbs, like those around Philadelphia, Detroit and Tampa, Fla., where far fewer workers have a postgraduate degree, make more than $100,000 per year or work in finance, science or technology.But the exit polls show a marked decrease in Democratic strength, with Mrs. Clinton winning just 66 percent of the Hispanic vote, down from Mr. Obama\u2019s 71 percent in 2012. Mrs. Clinton plainly fared worse than Mr. Obama in many heavily Hispanic areas \u2014 like South Texas or South Colorado.Our estimates suggest that Mrs. Clinton did about the same as Mr. Obama among Hispanic voters over all. The estimates hint at a potential explanation for the results in some heavily Hispanic areas: Mrs. Clinton may have faltered among Hispanic voters without a high school degree, while making gains among those with some college education or better.Nationwide, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s success in reviving the elements in the caricature version of the Obama coalition really did let her compensate for losses among black voters and working-class whites. She won the popular vote.But it did not do nearly enough good in the decisive battleground states.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuomo Adds to His Wish List as State Legislators Seek a Raise", "Date": "2016-12-01", "News": "Supported byALBANY \u2014 Upsetting the New York State Capitol\u2019s usual rhythms of activity \u2014 budget in March, all-nighters in June, indictments almost anytime \u2014 the Legislature is contemplating an unusual December special session, with a glittering prize as motivation: a pay raise.A salary increase has long been elusive for lawmakers, and if it is to happen by a Dec. 31 deadline, it may come only after some negotiation with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.The governor previously suggested that if lawmakers wanted a raise they should tackle ethics reform. But in recent days, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has amplified his request. If all 213 state lawmakers are to return to Albany this month, he wants them to consider a wider array of policy proposals, including financing for a new hate-crime task force and reforms for the state and New York City university systems.Perhaps even more surprising, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s office requested two amendments to the state\u2019s Constitution that would substantially change the nature of the government in New York by creating a full-time Legislature with four-year terms and setting term limits for officials that hold statewide posts. \u201cIt is now up to the Legislature to decide what they want to do,\u201d said Richard Azzopardi, a spokesman for the governor.The suddenness and breadth of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s proposals both shocked and galled the speaker of the Assembly, Carl Heastie, a Bronx Democrat, who responded with a sharply worded retort, characterizing the suggestions as a \u201cwildly inappropriate\u201d trade-off.And while Mr. Heastie said that he and Mr. Cuomo were discussing many issues, he noted that there were \u201citems that the governor has spoken about that have never been brought to my attention.\u201d\u201cThey cannot be considered on a whim,\u201d Mr. Heastie said. \u201cI have no idea who the governor is speaking to about these issues, but it certainly isn\u2019t me.\u201dThe proposed constitutional amendments would face a high legislative bar as well as a voter referendum, and many of the other proposals are the type that would be more normally addressed during the Legislature\u2019s regular January-to-June session. Still, in an interview on Thursday, Mr. Cuomo defended his late-year demands.\u201cIt\u2019s very important to me that Albany continue to reform,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the agenda I\u2019m focused on.\u201dBlair Horner, executive director of the New York Public Interest Research Group, said that move probably engendered some bad blood between Mr. Heastie and Mr. Cuomo. \u201cThey feel like the governor has moved the goal posts,\u201d he said.Like budget discussions in March and the end of session in June, the governor\u2019s Christmas-season push may merely be tactical, a starting point for negotiations.Mr. Cuomo said on Thursday that he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that the Legislature would return to take up his newly offered agenda items before the year\u2019s end. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting to see if we can come up with a mutual resolution,\u201d the governor said.The governor\u2019s gambit comes at a time when New York\u2019s Democratic Party is also dealing with a nasty skirmish in the State Senate.Democrats actually hold a numeric advantage in the 63-seat chamber, but Republicans hold the leadership by dint of an alliance with the seven-person Independent Democratic Conference, a renegade group of Democrats led by Jeffrey D. Klein, as well as with Simcha Felder, a Brooklyn Democrat who sits and votes with the Republicans.Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the Democratic leader in the Senate, quickly called on Mr. Cuomo \u201cto step up and unify the members of his party so we can fulfill the wishes of New Yorkers who voted for a Democratic Senate,\u201d a sentiment echoed by other progressive leaders.Mr. Cuomo declined to comment on Ms. Stewart-Cousins\u2019s remarks. But on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Klein\u2019s coalition responded, saying that Ms. Stewart-Cousins had not spoken to Mr. Klein in nearly a month.\u201cSo we have no idea what her grand plan is for Democratic unity,\u201d said the statement from the group\u2019s spokeswoman, Candice Giove. \u201cLeaders lead by engaging directly.\u201dWithin the hour, Ms. Stewart-Cousins\u2019s spokesman, Mike Murphy, disputed that, saying the two leaders had met \u201cnumerous times over the last few months and these conversations have been productive.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Business Since Birth: Trump\u2019s Children and the Tangle That Awaits", "Date": "2016-12-04", "News": "Supported byMs. Trump is nearing a licensing deal with the Japanese apparel giant Sanei International, both parties told The New York Times. The largest shareholder of Sanei\u2019s parent company is the Development Bank of Japan, which is wholly owned by the Japanese government.Discussions for the deal have been active for about two years, Ms. Trump\u2019s company said. In that time, she has become something of a local fascination. \u201cAt the moment,\u201d said Sayumi Gunji, a lifestyle-magazine editor who attended the viewing, \u201cIvanka is even more popular here than Mr. Trump.\u201dSince his election, Mr. Trump has chafed at the suggestion that keeping his business in the family could create problems, despite several episodes during his transition that seemed to mix business and diplomacy. While he has insisted that he faces no legal requirement to turn over the company, the Trump Organization has said it is preparing an \u201cimmediate transfer of management\u201d to Mr. Trump\u2019s three eldest children \u2014 Donald Jr., 38; Ivanka, 35; and Eric, 32 \u2014 along with a team of executives.Last week, the president-elect said on Twitter that he would make an announcement with the children on Dec. 15 about \u201cleaving my great business in total in order to fully focus on running the country.\u201d Doing so is \u201cvisually important,\u201d he wrote, \u201cto in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses.\u201dYet an examination of the professional histories of the three children \u2014 who also serve on the presidential transition team \u2014 shows how deeply the Trump family, Trump business and Trump politics are interwoven, raising significant doubts about how meaningful a wall can ever be erected between Mr. Trump and his heirs at the Trump Organization.For years, the three siblings have operated with few rigid dividing lines in their international travels as ambassadors of the Trump brand, allowing them to lean heavily on the reputation and financial backing of their father while establishing their own credibility in business.It is not merely that the Trumps are at peace commingling family and business. They have known no other way.Officially, all three siblings are executive vice presidents for development and acquisitions. Practically, they have served as their father\u2019s advance guard: the polished public faces of the next Trump generation, conducting initial meetings with prospective partners and reporting back to Mr. Trump.\u201cWe don\u2019t take titles particularly seriously at the Trump Organization,\u201d Ms. Trump said in a deposition this year. In depositions in 2011, both brothers likened the company to a \u201cmom and pop\u201d operation.Since the three joined the business, shortly after each graduated from college, lines have had a way of blurring.When Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s investment in a concrete paneling business in South Carolina faltered in recent years, leaving him personally responsible for a loan of more than $3 million, the Trump Organization helped bail him out.Ms. Trump, the only sibling to match her father\u2019s instinct for self-commodification, has used the Trump Organization\u2019s payroll, information technology and human resources for her separate brand. Her website\u2019s domain was registered by Trump Organization lawyers.\u201cIt is, of course, an advantage to be my father\u2019s daughter,\u201d Ms. Trump told an audience in Malaysia, via videoconference, in 2008. \u201cI think it has afforded me many great opportunities.\u201dAll three children declined to be interviewed for this article and did not respond to written questions sent to the Trump Organization about their outside business ties. In its statement about the transfer of management, the Trump Organization said that \u201cthe structure that is ultimately selected will comply with all applicable rules and regulations.\u201d\u201cGiving to the Trump family would be seen by many foreign leaders as the way to get in with the Trump administration,\u201d said Meredith McGehee, an adviser to the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit group, who worried that companies might be tempted to direct business to the Trump children to curry favor with their father.Already, complications abound.The children each hold a stake in the lease that allows the organization to operate the Trump International Hotel out of the federal government\u2019s Old Post Office Building in Washington. Mr. Trump, as president, will appoint the head of the General Services Administration, which manages the property, while his children oversee a hotel with millions of dollars in ties to the agency.In addition to attending the meeting with Mr. Abe, Ms. Trump was present for her father\u2019s initial conversation with President Mauricio Macri of Argentina. The children also met recently with Jose E. B. Antonio, a Philippine developer who is collaborating with the Trumps on a tower in Manila and who in October was named a special envoy to the United States by the Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte.The business partnership grew out of a friendship between Mr. Antonio\u2019s son Robbie and Ms. Trump. Eric Trump is also listed on an advisory committee for one of the younger Mr. Antonio\u2019s ventures: a company making luxury modular homes.Even nonbusiness expeditions have grown more tense since Election Day. Over Thanksgiving weekend, Donald Trump Jr. traveled to hunt wild goats in Turkey, where the elder Mr. Trump has \u201ca little conflict of interest,\u201d he acknowledged in a radio interview last year, because of \u201ca major, major building in Istanbul\u201d \u2014 actually twin Trump Towers. Security for the hunt was high, with private guards and Turkish intelligence officers, according to an official involved in the trip who was not authorized to discuss it.At times, the president-elect has grown incredulous when pressed on the specter of conflicts.He allowed, though, that his election had changed at least one thing.\u201cThe brand is certainly a hotter brand than it was before,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t help that, but I don\u2019t care.\u201dGrooming began early in the Trump family.For as long as they can remember, the children visited job sites, as Mr. Trump had done as a boy with his father, Fred. They sat in on meetings with executives and government officials, where, between fits of deal-making, Mr. Trump held forth on his daughter\u2019s progress in school. They came to learn that the surest way to reach Mr. Trump was to call the office.Despite this lengthy tutelage, Mr. Trump resisted a presidential run in 2012 in part because he did not believe his children were ready to succeed him. (The president-elect also has a daughter Tiffany, 23, from his second marriage, and a son Barron, 10, with his current wife, Melania.)While the eldest three have been presented, with Trumpian gusto, as business successes of the highest order, there have been some stumbles \u2014 cushioned often by the built-in advantages of being a Trump.The succession plan itself has not always been smooth. For a time, Donald Jr., who did not speak to his father for a year after his parents\u2019 divorce, was ambivalent about joining the business, spending a year after college in Colorado working in a bar and hunting in his spare time.Since joining the Trump Organization in 2001, moving quickly to learn the intricacies of financing and construction, he has said repeatedly that he does not expect preferential treatment.\u201cHe puts on zero in the way of airs,\u201d said Mel M. Immergut, a lawyer in New York who has long known the younger Mr. Trump and said he did not support the elder\u2019s candidacy, or anyone else\u2019s.Donald J. Trump\u2019s global business empire will create an unprecedented number of conflicts of interest for a United States president, experts say.But as Donald Jr. has sought to establish his own business identity, he has borrowed from his father\u2019s playbook \u2014 and, occasionally, his payroll.He and Ivanka were paid speakers at a \u201ccreating wealth\u201d forum that was described as free but featured event promoters seeking to enlist attendees for expensive courses on how to get rich.He has positioned himself as a spokesman for a hodgepodge of companies, including Cambridge Who\u2019s Who, a publisher that produces a registry in which consumers pay to be listed. The younger Mr. Trump spoke about the company during interviews on Fox Business Network and TheStreet.com.In 2011, Donald Jr. also became the public face of a Tulsa, Okla.-based company, MacroSolve, that primarily sued other companies, like Facebook and Walmart, over claims that they had infringed on its patent for a mobile device application. After several setbacks in court, the company has changed its focus.Yet it is his foray into South Carolina manufacturing that offers perhaps the most unfiltered view of Donald Jr.\u2019s independent business dealings.In 2010, the younger Mr. Trump helped found a company in the depressed suburb North Charleston called Titan Atlas Manufacturing, which made cast panels for prefabricated houses.Along with the North Charleston project, Mr. Trump and Mr. Blackburn sought business deals in Mexico and Colombia, traveling with executives of the Trump Organization and Yun Capital, an investment firm involved in Trump Organization projects abroad. In 2011, Yun Capital registered the trademark JB Development on Mr. Blackburn\u2019s behalf, filings show.By 2012, Titan Atlas was mired in debt, prompting a suit from a Philadelphia law firm it had hired to represent it. The firm claimed it was owed $400,000 in unpaid fees.After Mr. Blackburn filed for personal bankruptcy, the law firm turned its attention to Donald Jr., issuing a subpoena for him to testify about Titan Atlas\u2019s assets.The Trump Organization jumped to his defense. In a letter on company letterhead, Alan Garten, the organization\u2019s general counsel, threatened to file a disciplinary complaint about a lawyer at the firm if he sought to bring Donald Jr. into the case.A letter from Alan Garten, the Trump Organization\u2019s general counsel, threatened a disciplinary complaint about a lawyer seeking to question Donald Trump Jr. in a lawsuit.In an interview, Mr. Garten said he had been \u201casked to assist\u201d in resolving the matter even though it fell outside the purview of the Trump Organization.\u201cIf Don makes an investment in a company and legal assistance is needed, I\u2019m happy to get involved,\u201d Mr. Garten said, adding, \u201cI have always viewed my role as representing not just the company but its principals.\u201dThe firm in Philadelphia pressed ahead with its suit despite the threat. On the eve of Donald Jr.\u2019s testimony, though, a confidential settlement was reached.Separately, in late 2014, the Trump Organization formed an entity that took over a $3.65 million loan made by Deutsche Bank in 2011 to Titan Atlas. The younger Mr. Trump had been a co-signer on the loan. A spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank, which is a major lender to the Trump Organization, declined to disclose the details of that transaction.Mr. Garten described Donald Jr. as a \u201cpassive\u201d investor in Titan Atlas.Asked why the Trump Organization had taken over an unrelated business loan to the younger Mr. Trump, Mr. Garten said he \u201ccan\u2019t speak to that.\u201d\u201cThis was an investment made by Don,\u201d Mr. Garten said. \u201cUltimately, it was not successful.\u201dThe siblings occupy neighboring offices on Trump Tower\u2019s 25th floor, one level below their father. They often gather for a breakfast meeting at the Trump Grill. They hold equivalent titles at the Trump Organization.There is little doubt, though, whom Mr. Trump admires most.Ms. Trump\u2019s image as a stylish businesswoman, and now mother, has long lifted her brand, steering Ivanka Trump products into stores from Alabama to Kuwait and establishing her as the second-most famous Trump. Department stores throughout the country sell Ivanka Trump shoes, Ivanka Trump clothes, Ivanka Trump handbags.She has traveled widely \u2014 sometimes with her father or brothers, often without them \u2014 as a fresher face of the family brand, at times convening with foreign dignitaries: an adviser to the Ukrainian president; a governor of Rio de Janeiro; Queen Rania of Jordan.Often wearing the kinds of heels and sheath dresses sold under her name, Ms. Trump stars in an impeccably curated Instagram feed, filled with product placement, pictures of her children and the promotion of a hashtag: #womenwhowork.With Mr. Trump\u2019s election, at least one licensing partner quickly sensed an opportunity. After Ms. Trump appeared with her father on CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d reporters received an email promoting the bracelet she had worn on the program: a $10,800 bangle from her own line.Amid criticism that Ms. Trump was using her father\u2019s victory for financial gain, her company announced that it was \u201cproactively discussing new policies and procedures.\u201d Ms. Trump has also said she will separate her personal Twitter and Instagram accounts from those of her brand, which she wholly owns.Given its international renown, that brand is likely to flourish under a Trump administration regardless of social media strategy.In 2013, before the debut of a major clothing partnership, about $75 million worth of handbags, shoes and other products bearing Ms. Trump\u2019s name sold at wholesale, according to a company document reviewed by The Times. Of that, Ms. Trump\u2019s company would have received roughly $4 million to $6 million, according to people familiar with the business\u2019s financial data who were not authorized to speak publicly.In Japan, where news of her inclusion in the meeting with Mr. Abe inspired a media frenzy, she has become an object of intrigue for her glamorous image and powerful position in the Trump orbit. Japanese news reports often refer to her as Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cbeloved\u201d and \u201cbeautiful\u201d daughter.The expected deal with Sanei, the Japanese apparel company, is the result of a longstanding relationship between Sanei and Abigail Klem, an executive for Ms. Trump\u2019s company who previously worked for Diane von Furstenberg, a label that Sanei licenses in Japan, according to Ms. Trump\u2019s team. Her company said the terms of the agreement had been decided before the election.To date, Ivanka Trump apparel and jewelry have been available to Japanese shoppers through a small number of independent import sites. One of them, waja.co.jp, has reported a 28-fold increase in sales since the election, according to the local news media.On the home front, one of Ms. Trump\u2019s ventures was less successful.In 2007, Ms. Trump opened Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry on Madison Avenue, a short walk from Trump Tower. Her brothers had offered guidance, at least briefly, during a tour before the opening, flagging a structural misalignment in a bathroom.Like many other Trump family endeavors, the jewelry business was a licensing deal. Rings and necklaces in the Ivanka Trump line came through a partnership with a diamond wholesaler based in New York.In 2011, as Ms. Trump\u2019s store migrated to a space in SoHo, troubles mounted. Ms. Trump\u2019s partner, Madison Avenue Diamonds, which operated Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry, was sued by a former supplier, KGK, which claimed to be owed more than $2 million. The partner\u2019s lawyers accused KGK of incorporating fake stones into Trump-branded jewelry, saying that some gold pieces had \u201cat times turned wearers\u2019 skin green.\u201dBy the time the problem was discovered, the lawyers wrote, Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry had already sold 119 of the more than 250 problematic pieces, \u201cpotentially creating a public relations disaster\u201d that would endanger the business.KGK won its suit for reasons unrelated to the stones, whose authenticity was never proved or disproved in court. The supplier denied the allegations in court documents.Y. David Scharf, a lawyer for Madison Avenue Diamonds, said that \u201cextensive efforts were taken to remove the nonconforming items from the market\u201d and that all requests for exchanges had been honored. There was an attempt to contact anyone who had purchased the products in question, Mr. Scharf added, but not every customer could be reached.The licensing arrangement has allowed Ms. Trump to maintain a safe distance from any turmoil, and Ivanka Trump jewelry is still sold worldwide. But the SoHo store closed without fanfare last year.There is not, at least so far, much of an Eric Trump brand to license.By most accounts, though, the youngest child of Donald J. Trump and Ivana Trump has been an effective steward of the Trump Winery in Virginia, which has won local acclaim for its sparkling and still wines.Eric Trump, who oversees the family\u2019s golf courses, has also shown that he is comfortable with conflict.Shortly after the Trump Organization bought a luxury spa and golf course in Jupiter, Fla., in 2012, some club members filed a lawsuit claiming that the company had violated their rights by barring them from the facility, among other matters. The Trump Organization has said it did nothing wrong, and the case remains undecided.The legal dispute centered on the contracts signed by members with the Jupiter facility\u2019s previous owner, Ritz-Carlton. To join, members paid initiation fees ranging from $35,000 to $210,000, deposits that were refundable when they resigned. But that process could take years, and under Ritz-Carlton rules, those on the resignation list could still use the club if they paid annual fees and other costs like food and beverage minimums.When the Trump Organization acquired the club, it also assumed liability for those refunds, a pool of deposits totaling $41 million. But the company was eager to convert deposits into cash that could be used to improve the club.Soon, a letter arrived, signed by Donald J. Trump. It offered to reduce members\u2019 annual fees if they agreed to convert refundable deposits into nonrefundable ones and suggested that members who wanted to resign were \u201cout.\u201d\u201cI do not want to them to utilize the club, nor do I want their dues,\u201d the note read.But Mr. Trump testified in a deposition last year that although he had signed the letter, Eric Trump was in charge. \u201cEric is much more familiar with this club,\u201d his father said. \u201cHe runs it.\u201dEric Trump contended in his pretrial testimony that members seeking to resign had been allowed to use the club so long as they paid annual dues. \u201cThe status quo was maintained,\u201d he said in a 2015 deposition.During a two-day trial in August, he was forced to backtrack. Members and club employees testified that those on the resignation list had been barred from using the club even while they received bills.Presented with this evidence, Eric Trump acknowledged that his earlier statements had been mistaken. Juggling different policies at the family\u2019s assorted clubs was difficult, he explained.But on balance, the younger Mr. Trump testified, the estate had thrived on the family\u2019s watch.\u201cWe took something that had gone really bad,\u201d he said, \u201cand we made it great again.\u201dReporting was contributed by Susanne Craig, Michael Barbaro, Maggie Haberman, Steve Eder, Richard C.

{"Headline": "Calpers Cuts Investment Targets, Increasing Strain on Municipalities", "Date": "2016-12-21", "News": "Supported byThe board of California\u2019s state public pension system, Calpers, voted Wednesday to lower expectations for future investment returns, a step that will increase pressure on the budgets of towns and cities across the state.Calpers, a giant with roughly $300 billion in assets, has long been a bellwether among America\u2019s thousands of public pension funds because of its sheer size and influence in the investment industry. It manages the investments for more than 1.7 million current and future retirees, making it the nation\u2019s largest public fund outside the federal government. Calpers\u2019 move to lower its investment expectations is likely to prompt pension systems in other states to do the same.\u201cThis is very monumental for the organization,\u201d one trustee, Richard Costigan, said at a public meeting just before the vote.With the move, Calpers is changing its business plan, so that investment returns will cover less of the cost of retirees\u2019 pensions than previously. That will force local governments to pay more, either through higher taxes or reduced public services. Public workers in California will have to chip in more, too.At the same time, the move has little chance of satisfying critics of public pension systems who have argued for years that the sector\u2019s methodology is dangerously flawed \u2014 not just because many investment projections are overly optimistic, but also because pension plans use those projections to calculate their liabilities, violating basic economic principles.Such critics, many of them economists, say that because public pensions are virtually risk-free for recipients, their values should be based on the returns of safe investments like Treasury securities, which have recently hovered around 2.5 percent for 10-year bonds. Calpers now uses Treasury rates only when a city wants to drop out of its system.Under all other circumstances, Calpers currently assumes that its investment portfolio will return an average of 7.5 percent a year over the long term, and bills its member governments accordingly. Its trustees agreed Wednesday to reduce that to 7 percent, phasing in the reduction over the next three years.The differences may sound small, but just a slight reduction in the assumed rate drives up the cost sharply, because it is multiplied across decades and for thousands of retirees.Shifting expectations down to 7 percent will force the State of California to contribute an additional $2 billion a year for state workers, according to Eric Stern, a policy adviser for the California Department of Finance who briefed Calpers board members about the measure on Tuesday.All public pension funds pool money and invest it in the hope that returns will cover most of the cost of retirees\u2019 benefits. But those costs are rising quickly now, as the baby boom generation retires, and investment returns have not nearly kept pace.Even before the change takes effect, some cities in California have complained that their pension plans are too costly. Calpers bills them once a year for their share, assuming the investments will return 7.5 percent in the future. Calpers confirmed in a recent risk report that for some types of pensions \u2014 especially those for police \u2014 those bills are higher than ever before.Some local governments say they simply cannot keep up, yet they are not allowed an easy exit from the system. Pensions thus played a prominent role in the municipal bankruptcies of Vallejo, Stockton and San Bernardino, with Calpers arguing that the cities could not lower their pension contributions or switch to less costly plans, even though companies routinely do so in bankruptcy. Those arguments prompted the judge in Stockton\u2019s bankruptcy case, Christopher Klein, to call Calpers \u201ca bully\u201d with \u201can iron fist.\u201dMarcia Fritz, president of the California Foundation for Fiscal Responsibility, said the additional pension costs might push more local governments over a fiscal cliff.\u201cThe ones that are hurting the most are the small, non-volunteer fire districts in rural areas,\u201d Ms. Fritz said.They lack a tax base big enough to cover the substantial cost of keeping firefighters on duty around the clock, she said. Some have been experimenting with other revenue sources but have not found a permanent fix, and rising pension costs could be their death knell.Despite those concerns, Calpers board members decided they had no choice but to lower investment expectations. Outside advisers have been urging the system to do so for years. Its chief investment officer, Ted Eliopoulos, said last summer that investment returns for the previous year were close to zero, and that it would be a big challenge for Calpers to get through the next three to five years.With rising numbers of retirees drawing their benefits, Mr. Eliopoulos said this week that he had been scaling back the risk level in Calpers\u2019 investment portfolio. Stocks \u2014 both domestic and global \u2014 had been reduced to 46 percent of the investment portfolio from 51 percent, for example.Lowering risk, however, generally means lower returns as well.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Next Class of California Political Leaders", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Advertisement\nLOS ANGELES \u2013 Democrats are reeling after Republicans captured the White House and Congress. In Washington, the infighting has begun. And potentially most alarming for the party about to be out of power, there is a paucity of younger Democrats ready to run for office: Hillary Clinton is 69. Bernie Sanders, her main opponent in the Democratic presidential primary, is 75.The answer for Democrats may be to look West. California Democrats (and to a lesser extent, Republicans) are in the midst of a generational renewal, as some of the old lions of the party \u2013 Gov. Jerry Brown, 78; Senator Barbara Boxer, 76; Senator Dianne Feinstein, 83; and Nancy Pelosi, the house minority leader, who is 76 \u2013 approach the end of their public careers. And there is no shortage of rising Democratic figures ready to take the reins in California.This new class of Democratic leaders seems likely to reshape the political face of California for a generation. But for national Democrats, they also represent a potential talent pool of leaders who can help pull the party out of the worst crisis it has faced since 2005, the last time the Republicans controlled the White House and both houses of Congress. California also stands ready to become a laboratory for Democratic policy that, it seems fair to say, will have little chance for enactment in Washington, at least for the next two years.There may be no more Democratic state than California in this new Trump era. This election delivered the party two-thirds control of both houses of the Legislature, in addition to control of all statewide elected officials. And Democrats here stand in stark contrast in terms of ideology and demographics to Mr. Trump and his followers.That has been particularly clear this week in Sacramento, where the Democratic leaders of the Assembly and Senate\u2014 Kevin de Leon, the president of the Senate, and Anthony Rendon, the leader of the Assembly \u2013 introduced legislation intended to thwart any effort by Mr. Trump to crack down on immigration.\u201cCalifornians may accept the lawfulness of the November election, but millions of us do not accept the sentiment delivered by this election,\u201d Mr. Rendon said as the legislative session opened. \u201cIt is up to us to pass policies that would firewall Californians \u2013 and what we believe \u2013 from the cynical, short-sighted and reactionary agenda that is rising in the wake of the election.\u201dBoth Mr. Rendon and Mr. de Leon are viewed as part of this new class of leaders. They are also Latino, like many of the elected officials on the list below. Latinos now make up 40 percent of the state\u2019s population. In the latest sign of their rising influence here \u2013 and presumably nationally, at least at some point \u2013 Mr. Brown appointed Representataive Xavier Becerra of Los Angeles as attorney general, succeeding Kamala Harris, who was elected last month to fill Ms. Boxer\u2019s position in the Senate.Ms. Harris is widely seen as having a future in either national or state politics. Yet one of the striking things about this generational transformation taking place is that so far, it does not include many women. Karen Skelton, a Democratic consultant, said that the fact that three top California Democrats were women who had held office for more than a decade \u2013 Ms. Boxer, Ms. Feinstein and Ms. Pelosi \u2013 might have crowded out younger women looking to move into the ranks.But, she said in an e-mail, \u201cI\u2019m optimistic in the long run that Hillary\u2019s candidacy broke the glass ceiling of politics for many, especially in terms of fund-raising.\u201dWith an eye to the years ahead in California and the nation, here is a look at some of the top California contenders, almost all Democrats \u2013 this is, after all, one of the most Democratic states in the nation \u2013 but with one Republican who is often mentioned as having a statewide political future.The decision last week by Mr. Brown to appoint Mr. Becerra, a congressman from Los Angeles, as attorney general instantly rocketed him to the top tier of Democratic candidates. Mr. Becerra, 58, will be the state\u2019s first Latino attorney general. It\u2019s a notably high-profile job, with plenty of potential for conflict with a Trump White House looking to restrict immigration and environmental initiatives that have been championed in California. He\u2019s the Democratic leader of the State Senate, a 49-year-old Latino who is energetic, personable and ambitious. Mr. de Le\u00f3n has moved quickly to use his position in Sacramento to resist any effort by President-elect Donald J. Trump to crack down on illegal immigrants or roll back California\u2019s efforts to curb global emissions. That means he is going to have a relatively high platform for advocating a popular position in much of this state.Ms. Harris, 52, the state attorney general and a former district attorney of San Francisco, was elected in November to replace Ms. Boxer, defeating Representative Loretta L. Sanchez with 62 percent of the vote. Ms. Harris has the distinction of being both the first black and the first South Asian senator from California. Her political skills have won praise from President Obama, among other people, and her new position in Washington is likely to give her a platform to advance on either the national or state stage.Despite the cloud of obscurity that comes with being the lieutenant governor \u2013 particularly the lieutenant governor under Mr. Brown \u2013 Mr. Newsom, 49, has managed to strike a high profile, most recently with his strong advocacy of legalizing recreational marijuana. Voters agreed with him in an initiative in November. As mayor of San Francisco, Mr. Newsom broke with many Democrats as he ordered the city to issue gay marriage licenses in 2004, before it was blocked by the courts. He is running to succeed Mr. Brown as governor.Mr. Villaraigosa served two very colorful \u2013 if at times controversial \u2013 terms as mayor of Los Angeles and is now running for governor. As mayor, Mr. Villaraigosa pushed through a sales tax increase that spurred an ambitious expansion of the city\u2019s mass transit system, part of his campaign to reduce the reliance on cars in Los Angeles. He served as the convention chair for President Obama in 2012. But his years as mayor were also marked by a public extramarital affair with a television reporter, and he was criticized for spending too much time focusing on the glamorous side of Los Angeles. That said, he is a strong campaigner and can be a commanding figure. At 63, he is the oldest member of this class.An earlier version of this article misstated the office to which Scott Wiener was just elected. It was the California State Senate, not the State Assembly.\u00a0Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I.M.F. Stands by Christine Lagarde, Convicted of Negligence", "Date": "2016-12-19", "News": "Supported byThe International Monetary Fund threw its support behind its leader, Christine Lagarde, on Monday despite her conviction in a French court on charges of misusing public funds.In a statement, the directors of the I.M.F. said they had considered the court\u2019s decisions and had \u201cfull confidence in the managing director\u2019s ability to continue to effectively carry out her duties.\u201dYet the verdict \u2014 with its potential to tarnish Ms. Lagarde as a leader \u2014 came at a critical juncture for the I.M.F.Founded and largely managed by Europeans and Americans, the fund oversees a global economy in which faster-growing countries like China are seeking a greater role.I.M.F. doctrine, which advocates free trade and austerity for countries in financial difficulties, has been criticized as elitist and not sufficiently in tune with the populist movements sweeping the globe.For now, the fund must confront more immediate challenges. With Britain leaving the European Union, Italy\u2019s future in the eurozone perhaps in doubt and the possibility of global trade wars being set off by President-elect Donald J. Trump, some have said the steady, experienced hand of Ms. Lagarde was needed more than ever.\u201cShe has been a very effective leader,\u201d said Edwin M. Truman, a specialist in international finance formerly at the Federal Reserve and the United States Treasury. \u201cYes, there are big questions about the fund\u2019s future. But for her to have to step down now \u2014 well, that would be complicated.\u201dJacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary, expressed the Obama administration\u2019s support for Ms. Lagarde, saying that \u201cshe is a strong leader of the I.M.F., and we have every confidence in her ability to guide the fund at a critical time for the global economy.\u201d\u201cAt bottom, it\u2019s all about French politics,\u201d Mr. Truman said.Members of the I.M.F. board were well aware that Ms. Lagarde was facing trial in her native France over allegations that occurred when she was the finance minister in the administration of Nicolas Sarkozy.The consensus among the directors was that Ms. Lagarde\u2019s transgressions occurred when she was not at the fund \u2014 in contrast to those of her predecessor, Dominique Strauss-Kahn \u2014 and since taking charge in 2011, she had proved to be a leader capable of presenting a softer side of the fund while fighting hard to bolster its legitimacy in the aftermath of the financial crisis.More so than her predecessors, Ms. Lagarde has pushed the fund to be more aggressive in taking up the cause of women and focusing attention on growing issues of inequality around the world.Over the last year and a half, she has also led a forceful public critique of Europe\u2019s refusal to offer Greece debt relief in return for the difficult economic changes the country has been making.Nevertheless, while Ms. Lagarde may have retained the backing of her board for the moment, over the longer term, her French legal problems may have hurt her most valuable asset \u2014 her carefully constructed public persona.\u201cShe was a breath of fresh air, someone representing true change from the past,\u201d said Peter Doyle, a former economist at the fund and now an outspoken critic. \u201cNow she is just another tainted European leader.\u201dThose are tough words. But economists note that the fund\u2019s core mission of requiring financially ailing countries to reform their economies and fight corruption demands credibility and reputation of the highest order.And that starts at the top, with its leader \u2014 especially one who is as widely known as Ms. Lagarde.\u201cIt would be complacent if not delusional to say there will be no impact on the institution,\u201d said Nicolas V\u00e9ron, a specialist on international economics at the Bruegel Institute in Brussels. \u201cThe only question is how big is the impact \u2014 and how does it compare with the need for stability.\u201dMs. Lagarde\u2019s legal issues in France have dogged her work at the fund since she was appointed in 2011. She took over as managing director after Mr. Strauss-Kahn resigned following accusations that he sexually assaulted a maid in a New York City hotel.The case against Ms. Lagarde centered on Bernard Tapie, a former entertainer and owner of Adidas who had previously been jailed on corruption charges. Mr. Tapie accused the lender Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, in which the French state had a stake at the time, of cheating him when it oversaw the sale of his share in the sportswear empire in 1993. Years of costly legal battles ensued.In 2007, Ms. Lagarde sent the dispute to a three-person private arbitration authority that awarded Mr. Tapie more than 400 million euros, or $420 million at current exchange rates, in damages and interest, to be paid by the state.The court did not fault Ms. Lagarde for approving the arbitration, but it ruled that she had been negligent for not appealing the decision. The court, noting that a judge had previously invalidated the payout in a 2015 ruling and that she had \u201cnational and international\u201d stature, decided not to punish Ms. Lagarde and spared her a criminal record.Speaking to reporters after the hearing, Ms. Lagarde\u2019s lawyer, Patrick Maisonneuve, said he had a \u201cmixed\u201d reaction to the verdict.\u201cOn the one hand, she is found responsible, but given the circumstances, given the responsibilities that Ms. Lagarde had at the time \u2014 in 2008, we were in a major economic crisis \u2014 the court decided that it would not sentence Ms. Lagarde to anything,\u201d he said.Ms. Lagarde\u2019s lawyers can appeal the verdict before France\u2019s highest criminal court, the Cour de Cassation, on procedural grounds. But Mr. Maisonneuve suggested she might not, because no punishment was meted out.Ms. Lagarde did not attend the latest hearing on Monday, but was in Paris last week for the case.Jackie Calmes contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

His movies contain violence, sometimes of the grisly kind, but he doesn\u2019t go for the constant semiautomatic, conviction-free sadism that distinguishes the \u201cSaw\u201d franchise and other movies. He also doesn\u2019t go for the arguably cheap \u201cjump scares\u201d that are a feature of many contemporary horror pictures.But it won\u2019t do to call him old-fashioned. He\u2019s doing new things. The parallel editing of \u201cOculus,\u201d portraying his characters as young children and young adults in shifting flashbacks and flash-forwards that become increasingly complex as the movie progresses, is innovative. In \u201cHush,\u201d the way he uses movie language to change perspectives \u2014 from the deaf heroine to the hearing outside world \u2014 is similarly inventive. (\u201cHush\u201d was written by Mr. Flanagan and his lead actress, Kate Siegel, who were married this year.)While he worked with celluloid only briefly while studying film at Towson University in Maryland, Mr. Flanagan said in a phone interview that whatever platform they\u2019re going to be viewed on, he wanted his movies to feel like \u2026 movies. \u201cWith digital technology there\u2019s a huge spectrum of flexibility in what you can do to manipulate sound and image,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich you can push into a really artificial realm if you aren\u2019t careful.\u201dMr. Flanagan, who is in his mid-30s, mentioned \u201cJaws\u201d as a picture that showed him \u201cwhat cinema can do\u201d and also cited horror classics like \u201cThe Changeling,\u201d \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d and \u201cThe Shining\u201d as influences. He said the 1940s movies of the producer Val Lewton (\u201cCat People\u201d) gave him an appreciation of atmosphere.\u201cA movie studio has to answer to a marketing department, and to shareholders, to ensure the broadest audience possible for its product; it tends to err on the side of caution as a result,\u201d he said. \u201cNetflix has an incredible bravery about things that just don\u2019t excite a studio anymore. You can feel the excitement they have about just getting a project into production.\u201c\u2018Gerald\u2019s Game,\u2019 we could not have made it at a studio without substantive changes to the story. Working in this way takes away a lot of the red tape that you\u2019d have to machete your way through in the studio system.\u201dIs there any downside? \u201cThe question is how long that attitude can survive the bigger the company becomes, but I haven\u2019t seen any signs of it flagging,\u201d Mr. Flanagan said. Netflix will probably release \u201cGerald\u2019s Game\u201d in the spring. Mr. Flanagan said the service may want to give it some festival exposure before offering it to subscribers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Casualty of \u2018The Birth of a Nation\u2019 Controversy Speaks Out", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byThe CarpetbaggerAt Fox Searchlight\u2019s holiday party in New York last week, the Bagger bumped into a couple of stars from two of the studio\u2019s splashiest 2016 productions: one of the films soared to great heights, while the other crashed to an unimagined low.The other actor was Colman Domingo, who played Hark in the slave revolt film \u201cThe Birth of a Nation,\u201d which, for the first half of this year, before controversy engulfed it, was considered one of the brightest prospects for the awards season. He said now that the uproar had subsided, he wanted to share his frustrations and disappointments about how everything played out.\u201cYou walk into these rooms, and it\u2019s almost like a bittersweet look people give you in their eyes,\u201d Mr. Domingo said. \u201cI look at the work of my peers on the film, and I wish it was being celebrated. The cinematography, the music. Aja Naomi King\u2019s is one of the best performances of this year. But we\u2019re under the veil of the whole controversy, and people almost don\u2019t want to touch it.\u201dThen, in the summer, after Oprah Winfrey and Spike Lee heartily endorsed the film, news articles emerged detailing harrowing rape accusations made in 1999 against Mr. Parker at Penn State, where he was a student and wrestler, and his roommate at the time, Jean McGianni Celestin (who would go on to share a story credit on the film). Mr. Parker was acquitted, and the case against the roommate, who was initially convicted, was reversed. After news broke that Mr. Parker\u2019s accuser had killed herself in 2012, the scandal went nuclear.At that moment, Mr. Domingo, who had been sitting near Mr. Parker on the panel, said he felt the wind leave his sails.\u201cThat\u2019s when I knew that the 45 minutes of the cast speaking in detail about the film would be eviscerated,\u201d said Mr. Domingo, who is also a playwright and stars in television\u2019s \u201cFear the Walking Dead.\u201d\u201cI was disappointed,\u201d he continued. \u201cI would\u2019ve handled it differently. Could he have handled it better? I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to walk in his shoes. I try to deal with things in a different way. I think I\u2019m always trying to see the other\u2019s point of view, dealing in a very heart-to-heart way. It\u2019s heart-to-heart instead of mind-to-mind. But it\u2019s possible he felt embattled by the time he got to Toronto. This was something he created with the spirit of love and community, and suddenly he\u2019s battling other forces of something he dealt with 17 years ago.\u201d (Mr. Parker\u2019s acquittal came in 2001.) Over all, Mr. Domingo believed that Mr. Parker, whom he described as \u201cdeeply passionate, generous and kind,\u201d had handled the matter \u201cthe best way he can.\u201dMr. Domingo also found fault with the Bagger\u2019s question, a criticism others have echoed. \u201cLooking back in hindsight, I can see Nate\u2019s point of view. Why apologize when he was vindicated?\u201d he asked. \u201cBut I believe with the media, you must answer every question in some way. And in very, very, touchy situations, we must answer every question again and again. Even if we\u2019ve said it before, we have to say it again.\u201dLooking back, Mr. Domingo said he felt there was \u201ca huge takedown by any means necessary,\u201d not just toward the film but also toward black resistance in America. After a summer, he said, of \u201cdealing with black men on the streets and retaliation and Black Lives Matter, Blue Lives Matter, All Lives Matter, it\u2019s almost as if this film was too powerful,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like a big slap on the hand: Never try this again. Who do you think you are? If this were \u2018Madea\u2019s Halloween,\u2019 would they try to take it down? Absolutely not.\u201dIn the end, Mr. Domingo said, the controversy could be seen as a reflection of how he often sees his position in American culture. \u201cI feel in many ways as a black man in this country, you should apologize, or feel gratitude,\u201d he said.In recent days, Mr. Domingo said, he has discerned a shift around \u201cBirth,\u201d with more people being able to see it on its own merit.\u201cThis is one of the seminal moments in my career,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the moments I\u2019m so proud of in every way.

{"Headline": "The Problem With One-Size-Fits-All Health Insurance", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byThe New Health CareA co-worker struggling to make ends meet comes to you with a problem. The price of admission to a dear colleague\u2019s retirement party at an upscale establishment is beyond her means, though not yours.You both feel obliged to attend. She\u2019d rather bring some refreshments to a conference room than spend what she cannot afford on a lavish event. You like the idea of a grand send-off for your retiring colleague. There can be only one party.A similar, underrecognized conundrum arises in health insurance. Both you and your less fortunate co-worker are obliged under the law to obtain coverage (which you both want anyway).Unfortunately, neither person really has a choice because the plans all cover \u201cmedically necessary\u201d care, meaning any care that offers a clinical benefit. That includes lots of expensive and technologically sophisticated care that is no better, or only slightly better, than cheaper alternatives. You may be just fine paying for high-tech care of marginal value. For your colleague of more modest means, it\u2019s a stretch.This one-size-fits-all approach to insurance coverage disproportionately hurts low-income people, many of whom might reasonably prefer to devote their scarce dollars to housing or their children\u2019s education. To some extent, subsidies and other monetary adjustments can mitigate this problem. Medicare and Medicaid, for example, are financed in large part out of federal income taxes. And within the Affordable Care Act marketplaces, lower-income people receive subsidies that cover some of their costs.People who receive coverage through their employers, however, don\u2019t get that kind of help. Perversely, employer-sponsored health insurance is more highly subsidized for the rich than the poor. The subsidy comes in the form of an exclusion of health-insurance premiums from taxation. Since income tax rates are progressive \u2014 that is, the rich pay a higher rate of income tax than the poor \u2014 lower-income families get less of a benefit.\u201cThe notion that labor markets perfectly offset the varying preferences for health insurance among workers by giving higher wages to those who value health insurance less is a comforting but crazy idea,\u201d said Amitabh Chandra, a Harvard economist.The uniformity of insurance plans also affects the pace and composition of technological innovation. To extend our party metaphor, if everyone \u2014 even those who preferred simpler events \u2014 were effectively forced to pay for any retirement party, regardless of how lavish, we\u2019d see, and pay for, retirement parties of ever-escalating extravagance.The Cadillac tax on expensive health plans, which is scheduled to go into effect in 2020, is a step in that direction, but according to Mr. Chandra doesn\u2019t go far enough. And it is unpopular across the political spectrum. Other ideas \u2014 like incorporating cost-effectiveness criteria into Medicare and private plan coverage criteria \u2014 are sure to prompt disagreement.Contentious solutions they may be. But as the cost of health care and health insurance rises, it won\u2019t be a party for politicians feeling more pressure from consumers.Advertisement"}

I\u2019ve made my choice not to be part of Trumpland.\u201d\u201cAs for Anna Wintour going to Mr. Trump, she\u2019s a powerful woman, she\u2019s running an empire, she\u2019s the editorial director of Cond\u00e9 Nast,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can\u2019t judge her for going to a meeting. She\u2019s a professional, powerful woman. That\u2019s all I have to say.\u201dAndr\u00e9 has particular insight into Melania\u2019s style since, while on Vogue assignment, he went to couture shows with her in Paris and helped her choose her Dior wedding gown, and later flew with her in white-leather splendor on the Trump plane as Donald scarfed down Oreos and talked about how Jude Law was no Cary Grant.As Andr\u00e9 told me in the fall when I interviewed him, he came away impressed with the Trump women. He called Melania charming and private, \u201csoign\u00e9e and polished\u201d with \u201cimpeccable\u201d manners and legs that are \u201ca long drink of water,\u201d and said she had a gift for standing on four-and-a-half-inch stiletto heels. \u201cShe\u2019s very much like a high, super, superglamorous Stepford Wife,\u201d he told me.He also said that she was the most fastidiously groomed and exquisitely moisturized person he\u2019d ever met. (He now gives that honor to Kim Kardashian West.) At the Mar-a-Lago wedding, which he attended with Ms. Wintour, he noticed that \u201ceven then you could tell that Ivanka was going to be a very bright star. She had on a melon-colored dress.\u201dIt didn\u2019t take long for the guillotine to fall. One friend emailed him, \u201cOh my God, you have gone to the Evil Empire!!!!!\u201dHe agonized about the \u201ctragedy of ruptured friendships\u201d to me in an email, saying about Melania: \u201cShe\u2019s a nice person. I do not endorse Trumpism on any level. So why can\u2019t one be positive and want her to shine? I mean, it\u2019s good she cares about napkins, crystal, dinner plates with gilded edges to the point of over the top, and abundant flower arrangements. In the end, why pick on her when they should be picking on her husband\u2019s billionaire cabinet and his seeming readiness to turn the country back towards oppression, anti-Semitism, anti-culturalism, etc.\u201dAs we sit in the hotel lobby, he muses: \u201cI\u2019m not a big person in the world. I\u2019m maybe a big figure in the fashion world. I mean, sort of iconic. But I don\u2019t want to get phone calls in the middle of the night, telling me I\u2019ve gone over to Trumpland and I\u2019m going to Darth Vader because I said nice things about Melania. I voted for Hillary Clinton. I registered in North Carolina because it mattered. I went through hoops of fire to get my absentee ballot. And, quite frankly, I thought she would have brought back the pantsuit. I thought the gray trouser suit designed by Ralph Lauren she wore with the purple satin shell and the lapels matching the blouse was brilliant. The elegant anthracite gray dry wool actually was slimming.\u201cMelania, who opted at 3 a.m. for a palazzo jumpsuit, with one arm exposed and a flounce over the other \u2014 it seemed to me too Mar-a-Lago, a huge, full-volume jumpsuit. Trying too hard. And I am so tired of the long hair falling on both sides of her face. She has to upgrade her coiffure.\u201dBut isn\u2019t he worried that many of those on the left who complain about Trump as a dictator are acting dictatorial? Not one good word can ever be said about anything that happens for the next four or eight years? Is it fair to hold Melania and Ivanka responsible? Or are they putting a lovely gloss on some of Trump\u2019s unsavory rhetoric and actions?\u201cListen, Melania made her choice,\u201d he replies. \u201cShe married the man, so she\u2019s got to go with the territory. She\u2019s Mrs. Trump.\u201dI remind Andr\u00e9 that he told me that, at the 2005 wedding, it seemed as if \u201cDonald Trump was a cool guy.\u201d\u201cHe became the master of darkness, the master of the dark empire, as he became more powerful, as he started with birtherism and in the campaign,\u201d Andr\u00e9 says now. \u201cBirtherism is terrible. It was a terrible thing he did to Obama. And he never let go. \u2018Make America great again.\u2019 A lot of people think that means make America white again.\u201dI say that a friend of mine, the writer David Israel, is now calling it the Whites-Only House.\u201cPeople are really afraid of these dark, dark institutions of bigotry and anti-Semitism that have come out from under the rocks like creepy snakes and come up to rear their heads up like cobras,\u201d Andr\u00e9 agrees. \u201cPeople seem to have put all their egregious things on the back burner. Melania plagiarized Michelle Obama\u2019s speech. Let\u2019s just wait and see what happens on Jan. 20. I don\u2019t want Trump to fail, and I don\u2019t want Melania Trump to fail. But I\u2019m not going to sit here and say any more positive things, because I\u2019d get crucified from personal friends.\u201dSo the Trumps should never get a full measure of respect?\u201cListen to me,\u201d he instructs. \u201cThere is a lot of marzipan here. Marzipan is the glaze you put on a cake, a superficial glazed layer. It\u2019s all marzipan, it\u2019s all optics.\u201dSpeaking of optics, I tell Andr\u00e9 that the mother of a Times colleague I met at the White House Christmas party said she didn\u2019t mind that Melania had been a model, noting that Betty Ford worked as a model. And she didn\u2019t care if she had been an \u201cadventuress\u201d seeking a wealthy husband. But she did not like Melania\u2019s photo shoot of racy pictures with another woman, and felt she could not accept her as first lady because of that.\u201cYou can\u2019t judge a person by pictures,\u201d Andr\u00e9 responds. \u201cShe was a model. She took pictures.\u201dI mention that it\u2019s passing strange that Melania\u2019s project is fighting cyberbullying when her husband is a cyberbully. Andr\u00e9 rolls his eyes.Andr\u00e9\u2019s favorite first ladies are Michelle Obama and Jackie Kennedy. Of Jackie he says, \u201cI would have loved to give her advice, even about what to wear to the beach.\u201dThe night before, we had a tasty 390-calorie dinner of grilled salmon, broccoli and eggplant at the diet and fitness center\u2019s cafeteria. This is Andr\u00e9\u2019s fifth time here.I asked him if it was true that Anna Wintour and Oscar de la Renta once had an intervention with him about his weight.\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cAnna Wintour called an intervention in the conference room at Vogue one morning. And I was escorted downstairs by a fellow staff member to one of the executive dining rooms. And I said to this person, \u2018Am I about to be fired for something?\u2019 And I walked into the room, and there was an intervention going on. And Oscar and his wife and Anna Wintour and my minister, Reverend [Calvin O.] Butts, had been called into the room. They were ready to send me to the Duke Diet & Fitness Center the very next day, and they\u2019d already made the reservation. But, of course, I angrily rejected it because I was emotionally not ready to come, so I got up and I quietly left the room.\u201dAbout a year later, he finally made the decision himself to come to Duke and left straight from the Trump wedding at Mar-a-Lago on a Sunday afternoon.When he was a child, his grandmother worked every day to support him, cooking, washing and ironing. But on Sunday mornings, she would make him a special pan of biscuits and \u201cthe best\u201d chocolate cake.\u201cSo my weaknesses are anything I associate with childhood, which I associate with love,\u201d he said. But he is weaning himself from bread and sugar and has already lost 28 pounds.I made one last attempt to press him for an idea of what Melania will be like compared to other first ladies. We know there will be opulence. We know that she loves Valentino and Chanel and Manolo and fur and diamonds and that she doesn\u2019t like prints or going without makeup.When Melania did the Vogue cover, the writer Sally Singer said that the bride of Trump, compared in the piece to a Bond girl, had \u201ca slightly old-fashioned idea of femininity\u201d because she refused to pose for Mario Testino without makeup or perfectly styled hair.\u201cShe has those impossibly high four-inch, towering stilettos,\u201d Andr\u00e9 said. \u201cClearly, her clothes will cling in the right places, accentuate her figure and her model-style long tresses. Get ready for super-cinched waists, hourglass silhouettes and pencil skirts. She is already into one-shoulder, which Jackie Kennedy wore by Oleg Cassini. Melania likes monotone matching coats and beige dresses, but that hair will always be flying once she goes down the stairs of Air Force One.\u201cShe\u2019s very private. She just wants to be a mother. It\u2019s very similar to Jackie O, who also wanted to keep her kids out of the fray. When Barron was first born, she used to say: \u2018I\u2019m going off to play with Barron. I just want to spend time with Barron.\u2019 So, in a way, I think that she\u2019s maintaining her privacy with him and maintaining a kind of dignity because she\u2019s not making statements. I don\u2019t think that she would try to change the White House in any way. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what she\u2019s interested in.\u201d\u201cI wish them the best,\u201d Andr\u00e9 said. \u201cI want suddenly to see that she has incredible style, wake up and say, \u2018Oh my God, look, isn\u2019t that great?\u2019 I really do think that there\u2019s hope. We have to wait and see. As Sergei Diaghilev told Jean Cocteau, \u2018Astonish me.\u2019 \u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the age of Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley. He is 68, not 67.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Veterans Help Make San Diego a Hub for Start-Ups", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "Supported bySAN DIEGO \u2014 For decades, politicians lobbied to bring military bases to their districts for one reason: jobs. A base is akin to a corporate headquarters, bringing with it jobs in related businesses.Here, the high concentration of military bases has turned the region into a growing entrepreneurial hub for veterans.Many of San Diego\u2019s veterans start companies that function as contractors and suppliers to the military because of their contacts and security clearances.\u201cIf you look across all sectors of San Diego\u2019s economy \u2014 life sciences, telecom, biotech, health care, I.T., sports innovation, medical and wearable devices, clean tech \u2014 you will find entrepreneurial hubs,\u201d Mr. Cafferty said. \u201cOver time, growth has transformed our region\u2019s economy into a diverse mix of high-growth industries, some with direct ties to defense technology. This can be largely attributed to the veterans who stay here.\u201dYet veterans still face some daunting challenges in transitioning from the military to private-sector entrepreneurship. To address those issues, several groups have set out to help veterans navigate the complexities of starting a small business.\u201cWhen you\u2019re starting a brand-new business and you don\u2019t have any type of business track record because you\u2019ve been serving in the military, it\u2019s very hard to get a loan or find investors,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are starting a company that\u2019s directly connected to the experience obtained while you were in the military, then you have a network to tap. But if you want to open a Subway, that\u2019s a totally different story.\u201dVeterans who aspire to be entrepreneurs often lack solid knowledge of the industry in which they want to operate, Mr. Figari said. Some, he added, may struggle to understand that as business owners, they will have several jobs, not one.To address those challenges, nonprofit groups and former service members have created programs to give veterans the training they need. Mr. Figari\u2019s group, for instance, provides general entrepreneurship training to veterans in eight counties in Southern California.Nick Norris, a former member of the Navy SEALs, went through the Rosie Network\u2019s training after leaving the military in 2013.Predator Warpaint adopted technology often used in the surfing industry \u2014 a sport that defines San Diego\u2019s beach culture \u2014 and created a camouflage paint that contains SPF 50 sunscreen. The Rosie Network, Mr. Norris said, helped his company make critical connections for building sales channels to the military and to hunters, who buy it online. A Kickstarter campaign raised $30,000 in seed money.The inspiration for it came from his experience in the Navy. \u201cThe coffee is really bad,\u201d Mr. Wang said. His company, now two years old, sells its wares in both military and expat communities globally.Many of those leaving the service, however, may not know if they are suited to run their own businesses.One of them is Charles Matranga, who finished the program in June. Mr. Matranga was a member of the Navy SEALs for 26 years. During that time, he handled a host of business issues, including managing budgets, people and capital. Now, he said he is \u201ctranslating those skills into corporate America skills.\u201dMany of San Diego\u2019s ex-military personnel have found a home in the tech sector, which also dominates the region with companies like Qualcomm, Sapphire Energy and General Atomics. These kinds of technology ventures need engineers, especially electrical, aerospace and communication engineers, who are plentiful in San Diego.There, he created an entrepreneur-in-residence program in which participants collaborate and support one another. In exchange, they volunteer at least five hours per week at the lab. About 20 percent of Fab Lab members are active-duty military or veterans.\u201cThere is something interesting about the intersection of the maker movement and the veteran population,\u201d said Katie Rast, a founder and the director of Fab Lab. \u201cI think there is a call to action that really speaks to those who have served, knowing you have been the creator of something that has use in the world.\u201dThe company has just raised a second round of funding and is preparing for an initial public offering. \u201cI love working with start-ups,\u201d Mr. McAfee said. \u201cThe intensity, the pace, the flexibility and how competitive it all is.\u201dAn article on Thursday about an increase in start-ups run by veterans in San Diego misstated part of the name of a federal agency. It is the Small Business Administration (not Association).Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ghana Presidential Vote Hinges on Economic Perceptions", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byACCRA, Ghana \u2014 In the four years that Ghana\u2019s president, John Mahama, has been in office, the nation\u2019s economy has plunged along with oil and commodities prices. The West African country is on track this year to grow at its slowest rate in more than two decades.As voters go to the polls on Wednesday, Mr. Mahama is seeking to convince them that he has helped steady and has somewhat improved a situation created by global forces beyond his control.Gold, oil and even cocoa bean prices have all dropped, leaving Ghana with a currency crisis, an electricity shortage and a fed-up population that is having trouble seeing the benefits of any incremental progress Mr. Mahama has achieved.\u201cWe have done much work, but more needs to be done and we can only advance faster if we press on and stay the course,\u201d Mr. Mahama told a rally of his supporters on Monday, according to Reuters.While Mr. Mahama has sought to revamp Ghana\u2019s infrastructure, soaring debt and high inflation have hampered the economy. To cope with the mounting debt, Mr. Mahama\u2019s government took a $918 million bailout last year from the International Monetary Fund, which says uncertainty over oil and gas outputs jeopardize the country\u2019s chances for faster growth in the near future.Mr. Mahama, a former vice president who ascended in 2012 after the death of his predecessor, John Atta Mills, faces a tough race against Nana Akufo-Addo, a perennial presidential candidate who has emerged as the front-runner of several other opposition candidates on Wednesday\u2019s ballot.On the streets of Accra, the two main candidates\u2019 faces are everywhere on billboards and T-shirts, while supporters drape party flags out of car windows.Mr. Akufo-Addo, 72, a lawyer, has hinged his campaign on the economy, pledging to create jobs for young people and stabilize the currency, which has sunk in past months.\u201cThe atmosphere is ripe for change,\u201d said Perry Okudzeto, a spokesman for Mr. Akufo-Addo\u2019s campaign, citing a weak economy. \u201cThe people of Ghana are tired.\u201dIt\u2019s unclear whether Mr. Akufo-Addo\u2019s New Patriotic Party can mobilize urban voters who felt the pinch of electricity cuts and the economic slowdown in recent years, according to Franklin Cudjoe, president of the Imani Center for Policy and Education, a Ghanaian research organization.In the past, Mr. Akufo-Addo\u2019s strategy has relied on traveling the world trying to gain the support of leaders in the United States and elsewhere. In recent months, his campaign has focused more on rallying grass-roots support.For many Ghanaians, the economic slowdown has been palpable.Alfred Bossman, a 42-year-old electrical engineer, said the cost of doing business was too high and that economic development had been hamstrung by corruption.\u201cA lot of money has gone into the wrong hands,\u201d said Mr. Bossman, who said he planned to vote for Mr. Akufo-Addo because he had faith in the candidate\u2019s ability to turn the economy around.Emelia Larbi, 38, plans to vote for him, too. She lost her vending stand in floods that devastated Accra last year. Mr. Akufo-Addo might give her and other Ghanaians a fresh start, she said.An economy supporting so many infrastructure projects \u201ccannot be said to be an economy that is dying,\u201d said Kofi Adams, Mr. Mahama\u2019s campaign coordinator.\u201cOur president and government have performed,\u201d Mr. Adams said. \u201cThis is a government that has brought a lot of things that did not exist into this country.\u201dThe president has centered his campaigning in areas that have benefited from his infrastructure improvements. In some areas the strategy has paid off.Nana Asare, 37, who sells auto parts, said he would vote for Mr. Mahama because he was optimistic the president\u2019s modernization efforts could deliver more jobs.\u201cI have trust in him,\u201d Mr. Asare said.Despite scattered claims of voter intimidation in an extremely close race, election observers in Ghana said they expected another peaceful vote. For the last two decades the nation has handed off power from leader to leader with calm, even as neighboring countries endured violent presidential transitions.Both chief candidates in Wednesday\u2019s election have signed agreements calling on supporters to uphold the peace, no matter the result.\u201cGhana has set the gold standard for democracy in West Africa,\u201d said Johnnie Carson, a board member of the National Democratic Institute, which is helping monitor the vote. \u201cElections have been close, but they have always been largely peaceful, fair and transparent.\u201dSean Lyngaas reported from Accra, Ghana, and Dionne Searcey from Dakar, Senegal.Sean Lyngaas reported from Accra, Ghana, and Dionne Searcey from Dakar, Senegal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Is Going After Health Care. Will Democrats Push Back?", "Date": "2016-12-21", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorWhere should Democrats head after their recent electoral rout? As it happens, coming fights about federally subsidized health insurance offer the party a golden opportunity to engage people far beyond its urban strongholds, in communities that will be hard hit by Republican plans to shrink Medicaid, privatize Medicare and eliminate the taxes that pay for Obamacare subsidies.Donald J. Trump won the Electoral College, and Republicans maintained congressional majorities, because of overwhelming victories in small cities, outer suburbs and rural counties. Yet the president-elect and the Republicans are poised to deliver blows to the social fabric and economic underpinnings of those very communities. Along with Representative Tom Price, Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of health and human services, congressional Republicans say they want to move quickly to revolutionize all types of federal health insurance spending, using special procedures that require only 51 votes in the Senate.Congress will be asked not only to cut the taxes levied on businesses and the rich to finance Obamacare benefits for 20 to 30 million low and middle-income Americans; Republican leaders also plan to slash federal commitments to Medicaid, giving states the authority to shrink this health care program for the poor and elderly. And Republican House members, led by Speaker Paul D. Ryan, seem determined to abolish traditional Medicare insurance for retirees and replace it with \u201cpremium vouchers\u201d that would throw older Americans on the mercies of private insurance markets and require them to pay more for their care.Trump voters will be especially hard hit if just part of this sweeping agenda comes to fruition.Conservatives often point to poor blacks and Latinos as the primary beneficiaries of federal health insurance programs. But such rhetoric obscures the enormous importance of Medicaid, Medicare and Obamacare subsidies to economically struggling white Americans living in small cities and rural areas. In Pennsylvania, where Mr. Trump narrowly beat Hillary Clinton with overwhelming support outside big cities, about 17 percent of residents are 65 or older, above the national average. Meanwhile, some 16 percent of Pennsylvanians benefit from Medicare, and 18 percent from Medicaid. With the bulk of Medicaid going to elderly and disabled residents, that program is the single largest federal subsidy flowing into the Keystone State.Repealing the Affordable Care Act would also hit Pennsylvania hard. Under the act, some 468,000 low-income Pennsylvanians had gained Medicaid coverage by August 2016, and another 439,000 bought private coverage on the Obamacare marketplace, with more than three-fourths of those people getting tax credits averaging $251 per month. Health care is often sparse in nonurban areas, and the providers that do exist depend on federal insurance programs that help many patients pay for care. If radical Republican cutbacks in federal contributions to health insurance are enacted, Pennsylvania hospitals and health care businesses will lose vital revenues, leaving many lower-income and sick Pennsylvanians at risk of losing access to care.This is the case in other states as well, meaning many rural and small-town Trump supporters may soon see that Make America Great Again means accelerating economic decline and social devastation. Mr. Trump shows little understanding of the intricate interplay of subsidies and rules in the health care system, and probably has no inkling that federal taxes collected from liberal states like California, Massachusetts and New York heavily subsidize vital health services, businesses and family benefits in the very places that voted heavily for him. In delegating plans for huge health care cutbacks to hard-right congressional Republicans, he will be hurting his own base.But will Mr. Trump suffer repercussions if the Republican Congress plows ahead? Its proposed changes are unpopular \u2014 including repealing the Affordable Care Act, which only one in four Americans support \u2014 and eliminating benefits usually arouses anger in the affected groups. But political punishment will not be automatic, because Democrats currently have little organized presence outside urban areas. Small cities and rural areas are overwhelmingly represented in Congress and state capitols by Republicans, who will do all they can to displace blame.For the Democratic Party, the coming Republican assault on public health insurance represents a huge political opportunity. But to seize it, the party will have to beef up state committees and place a priority on activating volunteer supporters everywhere \u2014 getting people to write messages to local newspapers and social media sites, and reach out to hospitals, health care providers and nonprofits to beat the drums about losses the Republicans are inflicting. Even if Democrats cannot soon win outright majorities beyond their urban base, they must be actively involved in communities damaged by Mr. Trump\u2019s false campaign promises.Democrats cannot just defend Medicare; they must loudly point out that repealing Obamacare means eliminating the taxes that subsidize health care for low- and middle-income people. That huge and immediate tax cut for the rich would lead to the demise of subsidized health insurance for millions of less privileged Americans in rural, suburban and urban communities. Proclaiming this truth could help Democrats gain a new hearing from many Trump voters. But it remains to be seen whether the party can rise to the challenge of showing up everywhere.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Russians Pay to Play in Other Countries", "Date": "2016-12-30", "News": "Supported byPRAGUE \u2014 For a brief moment, it seemed that the powerful adviser\u2019s head might roll at the Castle. After he lost his long legal battle over a hefty state fine, the Czech president warned him to pay up or lose his post.Then a guardian angel materialized from Moscow.Lukoil, the largest private Russian oil company in an industry dependent on Kremlin approval, stepped in to pay the nearly $1.4 million fine owed to a Czech court.The aide, Martin Nejedly, stayed on as economic adviser to the Czech president, Milos Zeman, and vice chairman of his party. Perhaps more important, he retained his office right next to the president\u2019s in the Castle, the official palace that looms over the capital, Prague.But the payment last spring raised questions about Russian influence-buying in the Castle, where Mr. Zeman has staked out a position as one of the Kremlin\u2019s most ardent sympathizers among European leaders.\u201cUnfortunately in the Czech Republic, some advisers to the president or the prime minister are willing to cooperate with the Russians,\u201d said Karel Randak, who retired as head of the Czech foreign intelligence service in 2007. \u201cI am not saying that they are Russian agents \u2014 but unfortunately for some people, the money is more important than the security of the Czech Republic.\u201dAnd in some cases, experts say, the Kremlin and its allies resort to an old-fashioned but highly effective technique: trying to buy seats at the table of mainstream politics, never sure where or when their support might pay off.One overarching question about Russian influence in Europe is whether President Vladimir V. Putin has just been lucky that some politicians echo his thinking, or whether the Kremlin has manipulated that trend. For many analysts, somewhere between pure luck and outright manipulation lies opportunism, and they call that a Kremlin specialty.\u201cThe Russians systematically fill any open space, and they try to expand it,\u201d said Martin Stropnicky, the Czech defense minister. \u201cThey have years of practice, and they are not in a hurry.\u201dMoscow did not construct public disenchantment with either the European Union or liberal immigration policies, for example, but it exploits such issues, analysts said. The Kremlin seeks to weaken what it considers alliances arrayed against it, like the European Union and NATO, especially as it sees them spreading through its natural sphere of influence in the former Soviet bloc.\u201cEvery country that was successful in moving away from Communism toward an open, prosperous society based on law is a real threat to them,\u201d said Ivan Gabal, deputy chairman of the Security Committee in the Czech Parliament.Russia\u2019s funding of political movements or individual politicians is nothing new, analysts say. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, all manner of payments from Moscow came to light, including subsidizing of the antinuclear movement.\u201cThe behavior is so close to Soviet behavior it is ridiculous,\u201d said Martin Kragh, head of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Swedish Institute of International Affairs in Stockholm. \u201cIt is like they picked up an old handbook and just dusted it off.\u201dGleb Pavlovsky, a political consultant who served as a Kremlin spin doctor for 15 years before 2011, said the main difference now was that while the Soviet Union had sought out ideological allies, the modern Kremlin looked for anyone who could serve its purposes.\u201cI am certain that they pay a large number of different people,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the Kremlin they see this as the normal ways of the market. I think that they always have some money, a line item in the budget, to help in creating advantageous positions.\u201dAs prime minister from 1998 to 2002, Mr. Zeman was the key official in negotiating the Czech Republic\u2019s entrance into the European Union, lauding it as his country\u2019s return to its Western roots. Then he lost a presidential bid in 2003, withdrawing to a remote village and passing summer days floating in a rubber dinghy on a local lake.Most Czechs forgot about him. The Russians did not.He was invited to an annual forum used as a platform to attack Western institutions by Vladimir I. Yakunin, head of Russian Railways and a former Soviet intelligence officer at the United Nations. At least one Russian ambassador dropped in to visit as well, according to several Czech journalists.Mr. Zeman made a comeback in 2013, winning the presidency in a victory partly engineered by Mr. Nejedly, the key financial official for the campaign.Mr. Nejedly remains a shadowy figure \u2014 serving the president as a private adviser, not on the government payroll.He spent most of the 1990s working in Russia, telling one Czech reporter in a rare interview that he promoted Opel cars. He eventually returned to the Czech Republic and in 2007 founded Lukoil Aviation Czech, a Lukoil subsidiary, becoming its general manager. The company won no-bid contracts to supply aviation fuel at several Czech airports, including Prague\u2019s.But the business failed, running up almost $7.5 million in debts, according to commercial records kept by the Prague Municipal Court, including a $1.4 million fine Mr. Nejedly owed to the Czech state over a fuel deal gone sour. The records were first unearthed in November by the MF DNES newspaper.Lukoil liquidated its subsidiary. Court records indicate that Mr. Nejedly, who owned 40 percent of Lukoil Aviation Czech, paid nothing.Fostering ties with energy middlemen who owe their fortunes to Russia and exert considerable political influence is a classic Russian method seen in Germany, Ukraine and other countries. Such links might not be forged by the Kremlin directly, but by individuals or companies seeking to please Mr. Putin.Mr. Nejedly displays his Russian sympathies plainly enough \u2014 a recent picture published in the Czech media showed him holding his cellphone with a picture of Mr. Putin on the back.Relations between Russia and the European Union deteriorated sharply in 2014 after Russian used its military to annex Crimea and to destabilize Ukraine. In the aftermath, Mr. Zeman proved notably friendly toward Russia.He repeatedly criticized Western economic sanctions imposed on Russia, and denied that the Kremlin had deployed troops in Ukraine. The latter prompted Carl Bildt, the Swedish foreign minister at the time, to remark in September of 2014: \u201cI don\u2019t know if the Czech Republic has an intelligence service. It does? Then he should ask them.\u201dMr. Zeman was among just two or three European Union leaders who attended the May 2015 Victory Day parade in Moscow commemorating the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II. Mr. Putin greeted him warmly.\u201cIt is a pleasure to know that there are politicians in Europe who are capable of directly expressing their viewpoint and of asserting and conducting an independent policy,\u201d the Russian president said, according to the Kremlin\u2019s website.Mr. Nejedly, though lacking a Czech government security clearance, was one of just two aides in the meeting, a move Mr. Zeman defended because of Mr. Nejedy\u2019s role as an economic adviser.Since that time, Mr. Zeman has continued backing pro-Kremlin policies. He endorsed the Russian intervention in Syria, and last summer called for a \u201cCzechxit\u201d referendum like the British vote to withdraw from the European Union.There is a debate in the Czech Republic over the extent to which the Kremlin influences the president. Some accuse him of accepting Russian money for his campaigns, while others say his statements reflect the sentiments of a public increasingly fed up with the European Union. Then there are those who argue that he has long espoused a role for the Czech Republic as an East-West bridge.Some observers also note that as president, Mr. Zeman has a loud megaphone but little real power. The prime minister and the cabinet, who set policy, have remained staunchly pro-Western.The president\u2019s spokesman, Jiri Ovcacek, said in a text message that he would not respond to questions about alleged Russian influence. Mr. Zeman tends to dismiss his critics, including the press, as \u201cPrague whiners\u201d or \u201cPrague cafe society.\u201dMr. Nejedly, reached by telephone, railed briefly about the court fine levied against Lukoil Aviation Czech, before asking to see any questions in writing. He did not answer them. The Russian Embassy also asked for questions in writing and did not respond. Lukoil\u2019s Moscow headquarters said it had liquidated the company and paid off its debts in accordance with Czech law, noting that it had appealed the fine and lost.Mr. Zeman previously denied that Lukoil was among his sponsors, and Vagit Alekperov, head of the company, told a Czech newspaper years ago that Lukoil was privately owned and entirely independent of Russian politics, according to translations from The Fleet Sheet, an English-language news service.It is difficult to prove that the Kremlin buys influence. Even in the rare cases when the payments are obvious, cause and effect are not black and white. Various Czech politicians and analysts argued that President Zeman merely reflected the popular mood at home.Zdenek Ondracek, a member of Parliament for the Communist Party, said many Czechs were nostalgic for the days before 1989, when the Soviet model offered greater stability, income equality and relative ease.\u201cThe socialist state offered its citizens many guarantees, and no one would find themselves facing hardships on their own,\u201d Mr. Ondracek said, wearing a black T-shirt printed with words \u201cI was born in the CSSR,\u201d the old initials for the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic.In some cases, old ties may be more potent than any website pumping out false stories, said Mr. Randak, the former intelligence chief. He noted that many such personal links existed from the more than four decades that the Soviet Union controlled Czechoslovakia.Russian businesspeople, journalists and others have longstanding social or commercial ties here, and some undoubtedly work for Russian intelligence, he said.The Russian Embassy also tried to recruit members of the 40,000-strong exile community as agents of influence, setting up the Coordinating Council of the Russian Compatriots in the Czech Republic, according to two Russian leaders of expatriate groups, Alexej N. Kelin, the coordinating council\u2019s former head, and Igor Zolotarev. At first the exiles thought the embassy outreach was to learn how the Czech Republic transitioned away from Communism.\u201cThis illusion disappeared at the time when Putin came to power and the whole interest of Russia in its citizens abroad was treating them as a channel to exercise Russian foreign policy abroad,\u201d said Mr. Zolotarev, the founder of an expatriate group called Russian Tradition.In addition, Prague is teeming with Russian spies. The 2015 annual report by the domestic intelligence service stated that the extraordinary number of Russian diplomats accredited to the embassy here meant many were working as intelligence officers. The number of Russian Embassy diplomats is generally pegged at 120 to 140, compared with about 40 Foreign Service officers for the United States.Puppet organizations and other Russian operations \u201ccan be used to destabilize or manipulate Czech society or the political environment at any time, if Russia wishes to do so,\u201d the report said.In January, the Interior Ministry will start a Center Against Terrorism and Hybrid Threats meant to expose disinformation and the like.Analysts suspect the Kremlin is the main Russian entity that tries to buy influence, but hardly the only one. Oligarchs and companies are guilty of the same behavior.\u201cA lot of this is not at the direct behest of Putin,\u201d said Alina Polyakova of the Atlantic Council, editor of a recent study on Russian influence in Europe. \u201cThere are individuals who try to seek favoritism, who want to bring something good to the czar.\u201dHana de Goeij contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Christine Lagarde on Trial in France, Overshadowing I.M.F. Role", "Date": "2016-12-12", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, went on trial in Paris on Monday, facing criminal charges that when she was France\u2019s finance minister, her negligence resulted in the misuse of hundreds of millions of euros in public money.The trial caps a long-running legal drama that has overshadowed her role at the agency, captivated and irritated the French public, and exposed ties between powerful politicians and the wealthy. It has also compelled Ms. Lagarde to defend herself repeatedly since taking over at the I.M.F. in 2011, when another former French finance minister, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, resigned after being accused of sexually assaulting a maid in a New York City hotel.Ms. Lagarde is accused of \u201cnegligence by a person in a position of public authority\u201d in overseeing a politically charged arbitration case in 2007. In the case, Bernard Tapie, a flamboyant French tycoon close to Nicolas Sarkozy, then France\u2019s president, was awarded more than 400 million euros, or $430 million, to settle a dispute with the partly state-owned bank Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais.Her lawyer appealed for a postponement, but the court \u2014 which is hearing the case in the same courtroom where the French queen Marie-Antoinette was tried \u2014 denied the request. The trial is scheduled to run through Dec. 20 but could conclude earlier.Immediately after the request for a delay was denied, Ms. Lagarde, wearing a black dress suit and a red scarf, stood before the court and delivered a combative statement to the chief judge. She said, her voice occasionally shaking, that she was \u201cprofoundly shocked\u201d by the vigor with which the case against her was pursued and by the \u201ctheories of an imaginary plot\u201d by her to defraud the state.\u201cI would like to show you that I am not guilty of negligence, but that I acted in good faith and with confidence with the public interest in mind,\u201d she said.\u201cWas I negligent? No,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd I will work to convince you allegation by allegation.\u201dMs. Lagarde added that she was dismayed by the charges raised by the judge, \u201cwho doesn\u2019t even know me,\u201d prompting the judge to cut her off abruptly and to demand that she stop criticizing the court.If found guilty, Ms. Lagarde faces a maximum fine of \u20ac15,000 and up to one year in prison. She would not have to resign immediately from the I.M.F., but the fund\u2019s board would meet to decide what to do next.The I.M.F. board, which considers the case a private matter, was confident in Ms. Lagarde, the spokesman Gerry Rice said.Ms. Lagarde, a former senior executive and lawyer with Baker & McKenzie, has contended that the investigation is without merit and may be politically motivated. She chose to present herself before the 12-person court to answer questions, rather than have only her lawyers represent her while she stayed in Washington.\u201cShe wants to respond directly to accusations that are completely unfounded,\u201d Patrick Maisonneuve, Ms. Lagarde\u2019s lawyer, said in an interview.She is taking personal time away from the I.M.F. in Washington to attend the proceedings but will continue to carry out her functions as the fund\u2019s chief while in Paris dealing with the trial, holding conference calls with staff in the evenings and remaining largely in control.France\u2019s top prosecutor halted the investigation into Ms. Lagarde in September 2015, citing insufficient evidence against her. But the chief magistrate of the court, the Cour de Justice de la R\u00e9publique, which is made up of 12 French Parliament members and three Supreme Court justices, ignored a recommendation that the case be dropped and demanded that Ms. Lagarde stand trial anyway.As Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s finance minister, she ordered an arbitration panel to examine claims made by Mr. Tapie, a former head of the Adidas sports empire and a Socialist who switched his political allegiance to support Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s 2007 presidential campaign. Mr. Tapie, an entertainer turned businessman who has served prison time on corruption charges, had long accused Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais of cheating him when it oversaw a sale of his stake in Adidas in 1993.In 1998, the Socialist-led French government fully privatized Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais and extended it a $21 billion bailout after a string of scandals and financial difficulties. Mr. Strauss-Kahn, then finance minister, oversaw the bailout and ordered that the ministry deal with Mr. Tapie\u2019s claim because the bank was now in state hands.But it was Mr. Sarkozy who suggested that the ministry move Mr. Tapie\u2019s case to arbitration to speed a resolution after years of legal battles costing French taxpayers tens of millions of euros. Ms. Lagarde in 2007 sent the dispute to a private three-person arbitration authority that awarded Mr. Tapie damages and interest, to be paid with taxpayer money.The nearly half-billion-euro award stunned and angered the French public. Ms. Lagarde\u2019s advisers suggested that she annul the decision, which she declined to do because, her lawyer said, it would have resulted in costly new lawsuits by Mr. Tapie.A few months later, questions emerged about the impartiality of one of the arbitrators, Pierre Estoup, a former senior French judge who was said to have ties to Mr. Tapie\u2019s lawyer, Maurice Lantourne. Mr. Estoup did not disclose any such ties when Mr. Lantourne and the state body representing Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais recommended Mr. Estoup\u2019s appointment to the arbitration panel.Mr. Estoup was later indicted on charges of organized fraud, which he is contesting. Mr. Estoup and Mr. Lantourne are expected to stand trial in France later to determine if they colluded to facilitate the judgment for a large payout to Mr. Tapie.So shaky was the outcome that a French judge in 2015 invalidated the arbitration decision, saying it was marred by fraud. The judge ordered Mr. Tapie to repay \u20ac404 million with interest to the state, leading Mr. Tapie to declare: \u201cI\u2019m ruined! Ruined!\u201d However, Mr. Tapie is under bankruptcy protection and has not repaid the funds.Ms. Lagarde\u2019s lawyers argued that until a court determined whether the funds were fraudulently awarded, there was no reason for her to stand trial for negligence leading to the abuse of public money. The court was expected to question Ms. Lagarde on why she agreed to proceed with arbitration and then declined to annul Mr. Tapie\u2019s award, and whether she was aware of the possible partiality of the arbitration judge.The court has heard only four cases against French ministers since it was created in 1993.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Lessons From Argentina", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byAnother ViewThe United States should not turn away from Latin America as many populist contingents, both Republican and Democratic, have suggested. Instead, we would be well served to model our economic policy off the experiences of an unlikely economic role model: Argentina.For the last decade, the populist policies of the Kirchner regimes in Argentina led to inflation of over 40 percent, a painful recession, high unemployment and social unrest.Worryingly, the four main economic policies that defined Argentina\u2019s lost decade of populism have been adopted or are actively being considered in some form or other in Washington: protectionist trade policies, aggressively loose central bank policy, oppressive government regulations and a government spending spree.First, protectionist policies in Argentina destroyed the very agricultural and manufacturing heartland they were intended to help. The aim was to become self-reliant on domestic production and penalize those who exported or imported goods. Soy export tariffs, for example, eventually reached 50 percent, terminally crippling the crown jewel of Argentina\u2019s once thriving agricultural sector.By the same token, import restrictions started small-scale trade wars, and by 2015 trade conflicts erupted with more than 40 different countries. This left the domestic agricultural and manufacturing sectors in disarray. As recently as 2002, Argentina had a trade surplus of 16 percent of gross domestic product, but after more than a decade of protectionism, the entire surplus was erased, and 2015 ended in a deficit.Second, looking for easy sources of growth and debt financing, the government turned to the central bank. Destroying its supposed independence, the government influenced it to aggressively loosen policy. The result: Inflation exceeded 40 percent, hurting growth instead of helping it.Third, oppressive regulations strangled the private sector. The government began controlling things like the price of gas, the value of the exchange rate and nationalization of the private pension system. Artificially distorted prices at first led industry to stop new investment and, later, to stop production altogether. Huge shortages developed. For example, although Argentina has significant natural energy resources, government regulation created huge energy deficits because artificially set prices and burdensome regulation made private investment completely infeasible.An adversarial position toward the financial services industry caused problems like prolonged disputes with creditors and the nationalization of private companies \u2014 all of which shut Argentina off from international capital markets.Finally, with the private sector economy in shambles, the government embarked on a spending spree in an attempt to bolster growth. In 2003, when its populist fiscal policies first came into force, the government spent 93 billion pesos annually. By 2015, this soared to about 2.4 trillion pesos annually, mostly in the form of income transfers.While this initially bought popular support, the government eventually ran out of money with little to show for its largess, as average annual G.D.P. growth was a meager 0.3 percent between 2011 and 2015.With economic activity at a standstill, unemployment surging and inflation spiraling out of control, the populist regime finally lost the support it had mortgaged the future to maintain. In 2015, the country endorsed the end of populism, electing President Mauricio Macri to put into effect orthodox economic policy and bring the lost decade to a close.Export tariffs and price controls have begun to be lifted, and the adversarial approach to private sector investors has been reversed. Exports can now bring in much-needed foreign currency, help stabilize the value of the peso over the long term and lower food prices.Once ostracized, Argentina just this year has attracted over $20 billion in foreign investment into the government bond market alone. Investments in the private sector are also underway.A highly credible central bank governor and board have been put in place and allowed to exercise independent monetary policy. Raising the central bank reference rate to 38 percent demonstrates technical understanding of what is required to fight inflation, and highlights the central bank\u2019s newfound ability to pursue policies that may be politically unpopular but are wholly necessary to ensure long-term macro stability. The government has also adopted prudently tight fiscal policies; an overhaul package recently passed the lower house with a two-thirds majority.Credible fiscal and monetary policy has, for the first time, begun to anchor and bring down inflation expectations, thus lowering domestic interest rates. This has allowed the domestic financial market to re-emerge and begin to both raise and deploy capital to an economy starved of investment.While Argentina\u2019s future looks bright, arriving at this new regime required a long, painful economic and social crisis.The United States can choose to follow the path of Argentina\u2019s failed populist experiment to varying degrees. Or, we can use the experience of Argentina as a crystal ball and avoid the damaging consequences of populist economic policies.We can choose instead to adopt the remedies Argentina found necessary to begin to create jobs and raise living standards: Eliminate heavy-handed government intervention, ensure we have an outward-looking trade policy, follow fiscally and monetarily prudent policies and promote, rather than stymie, private sector investment.Dr. Michael Hasenstab is executive vice president, portfolio manager and chief investment officer of Templeton Global Macro.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lessons From the Media\u2019s Failures in Its Year With Trump", "Date": "2016-12-31", "News": "Supported byThe last year has not been the news media\u2019s finest.Despite some outstanding coverage, over all we misled many people into thinking that Donald Trump would never win the Republican nomination, let alone the White House. Too often we followed what glittered, yapped uselessly at everything in sight and didn\u2019t dig hard enough or hold politicians accountable for lies.In 2008, the three broadcast networks, in their nightly news programs, devoted over the entire year a total of three hours and 40 minutes to issues reporting (defined as independent coverage of election issues, not arising from candidate statements or debates). In 2016, that plummeted to a grand total of just 36 minutes.ABC and NBC had just nine minutes of issues coverage each; CBS had 18 minutes. So ABC and NBC each had less than one minute of issues coverage per month in 2016.Those figures come from Andrew Tyndall, whose Tyndall Report monitors the news programs. By Tyndall\u2019s measures, there was zero independent coverage in 2016 on those nightly programs about poverty, climate change or drug addiction.\u201cJournalists were confronted with the spectacle of an issues-free campaign,\u201d Tyndall told me. \u201cThey had to decide how to react: with complicity, since such tactics were easy to shoehorn into the ratings-pleasing entertainment structure of a reality TV show, or with defiance, by delving into what was at stake.\u201dThey chose the former, he says, and \u201ctreated their viewers not as citizens, but as so many pairs of eyeballs.\u201dThe entire media world needs new revenue sources \u2014 including philanthropy \u2014 to finance coverage that is important but unprofitable.Still, many of us chose journalism because we believed it to be a public good. I\u2019ve seen journalists abroad risk their lives to get a story because they believed it important. If they can do that, maybe executive producers can occasionally risk ratings?It didn\u2019t help that the national media isn\u2019t very diverse \u2014 not just in racial or ethnic terms, but also socioeconomically and geographically. We don\u2019t have many national journalists with working-class or evangelical roots, so our coverage of Trump voters was often shallow or condescending, and we largely missed the fury and despair that Trump rode to victory.We\u2019ll have to be persistent, continuing to press for the release of taxes and for policy details. We\u2019ll have to avoid the perils of false equivalence, quoting a person on each side as if there\u2019s a genuine debate when we know there isn\u2019t. And this may sound odd for a columnist to say, but we need more reporting, less pontificating.When so many Americans believe false claims, we should weigh in aggressively on the side of truth.Would it matter if the mainstream media did a better job? Or do we live in a post-truth age in which we are so distrusted that our investigations will be dismissed, if they are seen at all? I\u2019m not sure, but we must at least try.We will soon have as commander in chief the most evasive, ignorant and puerile national politician I\u2019ve ever met, and while there are many factors behind his election, I think we in the media contributed by skimping on due diligence.The lesson learned? As 2017 dawns, let\u2019s focus on what matters. Not celebrity, but substance: Will millions of Americans lose health insurance? What will happen to the 21 percent of American children living in poverty? Will Syrians be endlessly slaughtered, and will South Sudan collapse into genocide? Will there be a trade war? A real war?For too much of 2016, we in the news media \u2014 with many stellar exceptions \u2014 sometimes were mindless mutts that barked at everything. Partly because of that lapse, the country today needs a robust fourth estate more than ever. We should be infused with a renewed sense of mission. So, for a New Year\u2019s resolution, let\u2019s try harder to be watchdogs, not lap dogs.Advertisement"}

He asked Mr. Snelson to make a variation on \u201cEarly X Piece,\u201d which he later exhibited \u2014 without crediting his student \u2014 at an important exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 1959.Mr. Snelson had called the principle behind his work \u201cfloating compression.\u201d Fuller, around the time of the MoMA exhibition, combined \u201ctension\u201d and \u201cstructural integrity\u201d in a new word, \u201ctensegrity,\u201d which became identified with his and Mr. Snelson\u2019s work.The engineering aspect of his work and his interest in the structure of the atom, the basis of a series of sculptures that he called circlespheres, led some critics to regard him as a quasiscientist rather than an artist. Mr. Snelson rejected this interpretation emphatically.\u201cEngineers make structures for specific uses, to support something, to hold something, to do something,\u201d he told Eleanor Heartney for her monograph \u201cKenneth Snelson: Forces Made Visible\u201d (2009). \u201cMy sculptures serve only to stand up by themselves, and to reveal a particular form such as a tower or a cantilever or a geometrical order probably never seen before; all of this because of a desire to unveil, in whatever ways I can, the wondrous essence of elementary structure.\u201dKenneth Duane Snelson was born on June 29, 1927, in Pendleton, Ore. His father, Jack, who was in the laundry business, opened a camera shop when his son was 6. His mother, the former Mildred Unger, was a homemaker.Kenneth loved to build model airplanes and ships as a child, and he had the run of his father\u2019s shop, learning to take still photographs and movies. After graduating from high school in 1945, he enlisted in the Navy, where he was trained as a radio technician and sent to Washington to work in naval intelligence. He served only 13 months, discharged when the Navy cut back on manpower after the end of World War II.Eligible, just barely, for the G.I. Bill, he enrolled in the University of Oregon, where his courses in architectural drawing and design kindled an interest in painting.When he found out that Josef Albers, a central figure in the Bauhaus movement, was the dean of Black Mountain College, he signed up for the summer program. Mr. Albers, noting his aptitude for three-dimensional design, asked him to help Fuller by constructing geometrical models for him to use in his lectures.Mr. Snelson returned to Oregon, where he studied engineering for a time before spending another summer at Black Mountain. He later studied at the Institute of Design in Chicago and went to Paris to study with Fernand L\u00e9ger at the Acad\u00e9mie de Montmartre.After moving to Manhattan he spent several years as a cinematographer, working on television documentaries and making small works in a variety of materials, all held together by internal tension. He also began using plastic rings, bound with nylon thread, and ceramic magnets to make the circlespheres that evolved into his experiments with atomic structure.The 1964 New York World\u2019s Fair provided him with a big commission. Synergetics, a company founded by Fuller, was chosen as the architects and engineers for the Tower of Light, a pavilion financed by public utility companies. Mr. Snelson created a huge work of sculpture, \u201cPhotonium,\u201d measuring 30 by 35 feet, hung overhead in the pavilion\u2019s Court of Light, near the entrance.He began exhibiting at the Dwan Gallery in Manhattan, an important showcase for Minimalism, where he had his first solo show, in 1966. That same year his work was included in the Sculpture Annual at the Whitney Museum of American Art.In 1972 he married Katherine Kaufmann, who survives him, as do their daughter, Andrea Fionda; two grandsons, and a stepgranddaughter. His first marriage ended in divorce. His second wife, the former Audrey Goldenstein, died in 1966.In his later work, Mr. Snelson elaborated on his atomic structures using digital imagery, which allowed him to summon forth complex, intertwined forms bordering on the fantastical. He also returned to photography, using vintage cameras to take panoramic images of streets and neighborhoods in New York, Venice and Paris.At the rebuilt One World Trade Center, he came close to completing a work that, in vertical terms, would have been the capstone of his career.With the architects Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, he designed sculptural cladding for the building\u2019s antenna. Called a radome, it was a tapering multifaceted structure of interlocking triangles rising more than 400 feet. But the developers, the Durst Organization, and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, dropped the idea, stating that the radome would be too difficult to maintain and repair.In April the National Gallery of Art in Washington installed a 1968 Snelson work, \u201cV-X,\u201d on the terrace of the newly renovated East Wing.Advertisement"}

Once you do, you\u2019ll probably decide to keep some of your new habits.Mine used to revolve around cereal and granola, which are almost always sweetened. Now I eat a combination of eggs, nuts, fruit, plain yogurt and some well-spiced vegetables. It feels decadent, yet it\u2019s actually healthier than a big bowl of granola.Part of the goal, remember, is to relearn how a diet that isn\u2019t dominated by sweeteners tastes. I\u2019ve always liked fruit, but I was still pleasantly surprised by how delicious it was during the month. When I needed a midday treat, a Honeycrisp apple, a few Trader Joe\u2019s apricots or a snack bar that fit the no-sugar bill saved me.Finally, be careful not to violate the spirit of the month while sticking to the formal rules: Have only one small glass of juice a day, and eat very little with added fruit juices.There were certainly times when I didn\u2019t enjoy the experience. I missed ice cream, chocolate squares, Chinese restaurants and cocktails. But I also knew that I\u2019d get to enjoy them all again.The unpleasant parts of a month without sugar are temporary, and they\u2019re tolerable. Some of the benefits continue long after the month is over. If you try it and your experience is anything like mine, I predict that your new normal will feel healthier and no less enjoyable than the old.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "From Dominance to Struggling: How the Teams Performed", "Date": "2016-12-03", "News": "Supported byEleven teams with two drivers each raced in the 2016 Formula One season. Here is a look at their strengths and weaknesses. They are listed in the order of their final position in the championship. The team\u2019s engine maker is included when different from the team name.Few people expected that Mercedes would fail to win both the constructors\u2019 and the drivers\u2019 titles for the third season in a row. But its sheer dominance, winning more races \u2014 19 \u2014 than any team in the series\u2019s history in a single season was a surprise.The team also provided a different show from either of the previous two years of its dominance.This year saw the blossoming of Nico Rosberg, who had always lost out to teammate Lewis Hamilton but made his mark from the beginning of the season to the end and finally won the drivers\u2019 title.The German driver won the last three races of last season and the first four this year. He and Hamilton battled all season long, each winning multiple victories over the other.The team also showed some down moments, though. At the Malaysia Grand Prix in October, Hamilton\u2019s car broke down, costing him \u2014 and the team \u2014 a victory. At the Spanish Grand Prix in May, the two drivers crashed into each other, throwing them off the track and out of the competition at the start of the race.One of the great stories of the year was the Red Bull team\u2019s leap from relative insignificance last season, when it finished fourth, to finishing second in the series this year and winning the only two races not won by Mercedes. Last year, the team failed to win any races and the team took every opportunity to criticize its Renault engine. But then the team and Renault agreed to continue working together this year, but the team called the engine TAG Heuer after its new sponsor, the watch company. Failing to win in 2015 Red Bull returned to win the Spanish Grand Prix in May, with Max Verstappen, and the Malaysian Grand Prix in October, with Daniel Ricciardo. Red Bull was criticized for its heartless decision in May to drop Daniil Kvyat and replace him with the 18-year-old Verstappen. But when Verstappen won his first race for the team, the move was applauded, and the Red Bull team has been improving ever since.After hiring Sebastian Vettel, a four-time world champion, last season and progressing from no victories in 2014 to three in 2015, the Italian team looked ready to take on Mercedes for the title this year. Instead, for only the second time in two decades, Ferrari again failed to score a single victory. The team gave the impression it was in disarray and under constant pressure from Ferrari\u2019s chairman and chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, who is also the chief executive of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. The problems appeared aggravated by the loss over the summer of its respected technical chief, James Allison, who had helped put together the winning team of last year.Although Force India has risen up the ranks steadily since its 2008 Formula One debut, few expected it would pass Williams for fourth place in the standings this year. But improvements in the car over the summer led to immediate results. The team scored points in every race since the British Grand Prix in early July. Sergio P\u00e9rez continued to show his strength, scoring more points and finishing in higher positions than his teammate, Nico H\u00fclkenberg, including two top-three finishes this year. But next year will be a huge test for this independent team, which perennially has less financing than the top teams. It will have a new, relatively inexperienced driver next year, France\u2019s Esteban Ocon, who has been on the Manor team.After finishing third in the series in 2014 and 2015, Williams dropped to fifth this year. The team invested in some car part designs that did not pay off as hoped. And unfortunately, having failed to make the most of possessing the best engine in the series this year, next year with the rules favoring aerodynamics rather than the engine, Williams may have missed its biggest chance. Adding to the team\u2019s woes, Frank Williams, 74, the team principal, was ill with pneumonia and missed much of the second half of the season, as did his daughter, Claire, who has taken over much of the job of running the team. The driver Felipe Massa decided to retire from a long and illustrious career at perhaps the best moment, while Valtteri Bottas has taken a gamble to stay on another season. He will also take on the role of the experienced team leader, as the rookie driver Lance Stroll, 18, joins him, replacing Massa.Climbing from ninth last year to sixth this year, McLaren repaired some of its damaged reputation after the worst season in its history last year. The Honda engine and the chassis underwent improvements. Still, the series\u2019s second-most successful team in history managed to score points in only 13 of 21 races, far from the near-perfect records of the top two teams. Ferrari, by contrast, scored in every race but one. McLaren\u2019s points were always scored in the midfield to the back of the standings, from fifth down to the 10th position. Fernando Alonso outperformed Jenson Button, by 54 points to 21, and Button announced his retirement from the series, although he remains on contract. In November, just as it seemed the team might be recovering from its troubles, it experienced a management coup that ousted Ron Dennis, who had directed the team since 1980. Although he will run neither the team nor the company, he remains a part-owner. Next year will be a make-it-or-break-it season to be watched closely.Holding on to seventh place two years in a row was impressive, considering that the team could not go far while using the year-old Ferrari engine. The team started the season fairly strongly, with Verstappen and Carlos Sainz Jr. competing against each other for the second year in a row. But it scored only 18 of its 63 points in the second half of the season, after handing Verstappen over to the Red Bull team and taking on Red Bull\u2019s Daniil Kvyat. Although Kvyat scored only three points after rejoining Toro Rosso, compared with 42 for Sainz during the same period, Kvyat began to lift his spirits toward the end, and the team hired him back for next season. But it will take more than a revitalized driver pairing next year. It will take a much better car and engine if this Red Bull training team is to rise above its current standing.Haas finished eighth in the team\u2019s first season in the series this year, succeeding in its gamble to enter the series as a completely new team on a new foundation. The idea was to spend less money by outsourcing much of the car construction and parts. Compared with the other new teams that entered the series in the last decade, Haas got the best results, scoring in its very first race. But 28 of the team\u2019s 29 points were scored by Romain Grosjean in the first nine races, indicating that the team was incapable of improving the car further, compared with other teams. After Esteban Guti\u00e9rrez finished five times in 11th position, just one spot away from scoring a point, he was finally told at the penultimate race of the season that he would not race with the team next year. Next year, its second, will be a true test of the only United States-based team, when Guti\u00e9rrez is replaced by Kevin Magnussen, who has been at Renault.Last year, racing under the Lotus name, the team finished sixth. But it fell to ninth this year \u2014 a catastrophic result \u2014 as it returned for the first season under its own name, Renault.At the team launch before the season started, Carlos Ghosn, the chief executive of Renault, said that it would likely take several years before it would be a contender for the title.An intense battle played out between Magnussen and Jolyon Palmer, a rookie, over who would remain on the team next year. Palmer ultimately won after he improved his performance in the second half of the season.While the team\u2019s results looked bad from the outside, the team said it had spent the season rebuilding, rehiring staff, investing and working on the car for 2017. With the experienced driver H\u00fclkenberg from Force India signing on next year, there\u2019s a good chance the team can return to form.It was not until the penultimate race, at the Brazilian Grand Prix in November, that Sauber, one of the most respected teams on the grid, was able to score points. Felipe Nasr, the Brazilian driver on his home turf, finished the rain-soaked race in ninth position. As a result, he scored two points and lifted the team into 10th position in the series, ahead of the Manor team. It was just the result the team needed to cap off what had been a difficult season as Sauber faced the most serious financial problems of its 23-year history in the series. Finally, however, in July the team announced that it had found a buyer and that its financial problems were solved for the moment. The driver Marcus Ericsson failed to score any points, but the team has hired him back for next year.It was a year of contrasts for the series\u2019s perennial straggler. Changing its management and its engine \u2014 from Ferrari to Mercedes \u2014 were promising moves. It reached its peak at the Austrian Grand Prix in July in a brilliant drive by Pascal Wehrlein, the young rookie and Mercedes prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who finished 10th to score a point for the team.After dropping the Indonesian driver Rio Haryanto and replacing him with another young Mercedes prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Ocon, at the Belgian Grand Prix in August, there was hope for even more good news. Unfortunately, while the team continued to appear on the cusp of finishing the championship in 10th position among teams, its hopes were shattered at the Brazilian Grand Prix in November, when Sauber scored its two points. Finishing 11th means tens of millions of dollars less in prize money than if it had finished 10th, and subsequently, a more difficult season ahead next year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sisters\u2019 Deaths Reveal Strains in City\u2019s Efforts to Tackle Homelessness", "Date": "2016-12-08", "News": "Supported byAlthough Mr. de Blasio characterized the deaths on Thursday as a \u201cfreak accident,\u201d the tragedy underscored the many challenges he faces in addressing an issue where even the potential solutions can create further problems.Rising rents are driving record numbers of New Yorkers into homelessness. The city\u2019s shelters are bursting, but efforts to build more have been met with neighborhood resistance. Alternate forms of shelter, such as temporarily housing families in so-called cluster sites \u2014 like the building where the girls died \u2014 are costly and, officials say, can contribute to other problems.This year, Mr. de Blasio said he planned to eliminate the use of cluster-site apartments. The units are notorious for being in buildings with often severe housing violations, are typically more expensive than some other types of shelter, hamper the delivery of needed services because of their scattered locations, and, most important to city officials, take affordable housing off the market, exacerbating the very conditions that feed the homelessness crisis.\u201cThe cost of housing in this town continues to go up, wages are not going up anywhere near the same with it, more people are becoming homeless,\u201d Mr. de Blasio told reporters before an event in Queens on Thursday.\u201cWe\u2019re trying everything we know to keep them out of shelter,\u201d he added, \u201cto find any other way to get them someplace else better or, if they get in shelter, to get them out of shelter quick and back to some kind of housing. But this is a constant flow of people we\u2019re trying to support and address.\u201dThe sisters killed on Wednesday, Ibanez Ambrose, 2, and Scylee Vayoh Ambrose, 1, died from overheating and thermal injuries from exposure to steam, said Julie Bolcer, a spokeswoman for the city Medical Examiner\u2019s Office, which ruled the deaths an accident.The episode occurred in an apartment on Hunts Point Avenue where the girls and their parents had been placed by the Department of Homeless Services. The girls were sleeping in a bedroom \u2014 one in a playpen, the other in a bed \u2014 when the valve on a radiator apparently detached, spewing steam into the room, the police said. The girls\u2019 father was in another room at the time.\u201cWhat we know so far suggests an extraordinary and unprecedented accident, something that we \u2014 no one that I\u2019ve talked to so far in any agency has ever seen anything like this.\u201d Mr. de Blasio said.It was unclear whether conditions at the building \u2014 whose owner, Moshe Piller, was ranked No. 4 on a list of the city\u2019s 100 worst landlords prepared by the public advocate\u2019s office in 2015 \u2014 had led directly to the toddlers\u2019 deaths.The mayor, who said the inquiry into the deaths was continuing, visited the apartment on Wednesday, accompanied by Steven Banks, commissioner of the Department of Social Services.\u201cI looked at this apartment personally very, very carefully,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cThere were not evident health and safety dangers in this apartment.\u201dThe girls\u2019 father, Peter Ambrose, said in a telephone interview on Thursday that he and his wife happened to have been awakened around 6 a.m. on Wednesday, when a valve on a different radiator \u2014 in the living room, where they were sleeping \u2014 \u201cblew off\u201d and steam poured out.Mr. Ambrose said that the valve was extremely hot and that he had to use an oven mitt to pick it up and put it back on the radiator.The girls were asleep in the adjacent bedroom, with the door closed, he said. Ms. Ambrose then left to run errands, he said. \u201cShe gave me a kiss and told me to keep an eye on the girls,\u201d he said, adding that he had gone back to sleep.Around 11 a.m., he said, Ms. Ambrose returned. \u201cShe opened the door of the room,\u201d Mr. Ambrose said, his voice quavering. He was unable to speak further.In a later interview, Chad Boonswang, a lawyer for the family, said, \u201cWhen the mother went to rouse them, she opened the door and immediately saw all the steam in the room.\u201dMs. Ambrose picked up one of the girls, who was blistered and purple, and ran outside screaming to call 911; her husband picked up the second girl, whose skin was also swollen and discolored by burns, Mr. Boonswang said.The valve on the radiator in the bedroom had blown off, he said. \u201cThere was steam pouring in the room for God knows how long,\u201d Mr. Boonswang said.Mr. Banks said that an inspector from the Department of Homeless Services had visited the apartment on Monday for a routine inspection and had reported finding no problems. \u201cThey didn\u2019t notice anything untoward,\u201d Mr. Banks said.Mr. Banks said that what he saw in the apartment reflected a loving family.\u201cThere were toys, there were pictures of the parents together, a picture of the parents together with their children,\u201d he said. \u201cDrawings that had been made, obviously, by a parent from the children to the other parent. Valentine\u2019s Day, Happy Birthday, expressions of love for one another. It was just heartbreaking.\u201dMr. Banks, citing a desire to protect the family\u2019s privacy, declined to say how long they had lived in the apartment or to provide other details about their contacts with their authorities.The family did have some contact with the authorities, according to a police official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing. Employees of the Administration for Children\u2019s Services questioned the couple last month because of a report that Ms. Ambrose had been seen playing a guitar and panhandling with the two girls at Grand Central Terminal, the police official said. Officials also visited the family\u2019s apartment in August after the couple got into a loud argument, the police official said.Mr. Ambrose said the couple had moved to New York from a small town in Maine because they wanted to raise their daughters in a big city. \u201cWe wanted to give them something we didn\u2019t have when we grew up,\u201d he said.He said he had found occasional work as a tattoo artist and as a house painter, and that his wife was a musician and had recently gotten work as a security guard.\u201cIt was a little harder to get it all going,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t research the prices. It was more like one of those things you think you can do, dream you can do. It was more of a struggle than we anticipated.\u201dThe family\u2019s struggle illustrates one of the many paths to homelessness in New York, and why the city is wrestling with a growing shelter population. Mr. Banks said that in January, when the decision was made to phase out cluster sites, there were about 3,600 such apartments. Since then, he said, about 450 have been eliminated, leaving about 3,200, with about 12,000 people living in them.\u201cThe tragedy of last night highlights the urgency of getting out of clusters, the urgency of getting out of commercial hotels, and getting purpose-built shelters in place around the city,\u201d Mr. Banks said. He said that nine new permanent shelters had recently opened and that a plan was being developed to build more.But Mr. Banks said the city could not simply abandon cluster sites without finding other places for the families living in them.Some homeless people have been put into hotel rooms paid for by the city instead of being placed in cluster apartments. But hotel rooms are more than twice as expensive as cluster apartments, and present other problems, including, in many cases, the absence of kitchens.Mr. de Blasio vowed, after a homeless mother and two of her children were murdered in February in a Staten Island hotel where they had been placed by the city, to rapidly reduce the city\u2019s use of hotels as a form of shelter.Instead, the opposite happened. In January, there were 2,449 homeless people staying in several hundred hotel rooms. On Nov. 30, there were 7,289 homeless people staying in more than 3,000 hotel rooms, according to the Department of Homeless Services.An article on Friday about two toddlers who were burned to death by radiator steam in city-financed homeless housing in the South Bronx referred incorrectly to New York City\u2019s efforts to shelter some homeless residents. Some of the people have been placed in hotel rooms paid for by the city instead of being placed in cluster apartments; the city has not moved people from cluster apartments to hotels.Eli Rosenberg, Nate Schweber and Ashley Southall contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cyril D. Tyson Dies at 89; Fought Poverty in a Turbulent Era", "Date": "2016-12-30", "News": "Supported byCyril D. Tyson, who led antipoverty programs from inside and outside government in New York City and Newark in the 1960s in a tense racial atmosphere punctuated by violence, died on Thursday at his home in North Salem, N.Y. He was 89.His wife of 64 years, Sunchita, said he died after several strokes.He played a major role in designing the group\u2019s programs, which were aimed at improving the area\u2019s public schools and its residents\u2019 job skills and opportunities. It included after-school remedial study centers and on-the-job training projects.Urban affairs specialists at the time recommended such programs to remedy shortcomings that, they said, fueled racial unrest. In July 1964, the fatal shooting of a black teenager by a white police lieutenant led to rioting and looting in Harlem that left one person dead and many injured and caused extensive property damage.Mr. Tyson said at an education conference that year that many black students were simply not learning. \u201cTeachers are just not teaching,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have low expectations and say the children can\u2019t learn because they are black.\u201dHe also defended welfare recipients, saying they had been unjustly stigmatized.\u201cThe implication was there, in public attitudes and administrative regulations, that people in need were somehow innately inferior to other human beings,\u201d he wrote in The Boston Globe. \u201cIn fact, the majority of those on welfare who are not children, aged or disabled are people who want the opportunity to be productive.\u201dWhile he worked on shaping Haryou\u2019s programs, a fight for control of the group flared between its most prominent founder, Kenneth B. Clark \u2014 the psychologist and educator whose studies influenced the Supreme Court a decade earlier when it ruled against racial segregation in public schools \u2014 and the Rev. Adam Clayton Powell Jr., the congressman from Harlem.Mr. Clark, with whom Mr. Tyson had worked closely, resigned from the group, and Mr. Tyson, then the acting executive director, followed suit in late 1964, when Mr. Powell was about to prevail in his choice for a permanent executive director. Mr. Tyson became executive director of the nonprofit United Community Corporation in Newark, newly created to run that troubled city\u2019s antipoverty programs.The Newark organization, too, was soon involved in a battle with politicians. A City Council committee demanded that United Community be replaced by a commission controlled by City Hall. The committee contended that the group lacked controls to keep it from becoming a \u201cgrab bag and a pork barrel\u201d and that it paid excessive salaries. United Community said the \u201creal issue\u201d was a desire for political control over the programs.The group was still running the programs when Mr. Tyson resigned in 1966 to became deputy administrator for minority economic development at the New York City Human Resources Administration under Mayor John V. Lindsay. (A year later, five days of rioting by blacks in Newark took 26 lives and inflicted millions of dollars in property damage.)Mr. Tyson was later named commissioner of the New York Manpower and Career Development Agency, where he centralized efforts to help the poor find work. The \u201cpiecemeal approach of the past,\u201d with programs carried out by many public and private agencies, was rife with inefficiencies, he said.But he found critics in New York as well. A City Council committee said his agency\u2019s job-training courses had failed to meet the needs of business. Mr. Tyson argued otherwise. He offered statistics from August 1970 showing that the agency had placed nearly 19,000 people in jobs and trained 15,000 others in the previous year.He left the agency that year for a fellowship at the Institute of Politics at Harvard. Later in the 1970s and in the \u201980s, he was a public and community affairs official at City College of New York and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, where he was also a transportation planning official. He wrote several books based on his years in antipoverty work.Cyril deGrasse Tyson was born on Oct. 19, 1927, in Manhattan to Albert Tyson, a security guard, and Altima Tyson, who was active in community affairs.He competed in military track and field events while in the Army. As a member of the track team at St. Francis College in Brooklyn, he was the metropolitan intercollegiate 600-yard champion in 1950 and 1951. He earned a master\u2019s degree in social work at Columbia University.Mr. Tyson married Sunchita Feliciano in 1952. In addition to his wife and his son Neil, he is survived by another son, Stephen Joseph Tyson, a painter; a daughter, Lynn Antipas Tyson, a business executive; a sister, Joan Fortun\u00e9; and six grandchildren.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Agency in Limbo as Hidden Costs of \u2018Brexit\u2019 Continue to Mount", "Date": "2016-12-25", "News": "Supported byJust two years later, the organization is preparing to relocate again, but this time its likely move has sent tremors through Britain\u2019s pharmaceutical industry and raised fears over public safety.That surprise decision means the organization, a European Union agency, will almost certainly have to leave Britain, just one of the many unanticipated consequences of the vote that is forcing the country to unscramble 40 years of European integration.With the agency\u2019s days in London almost certainly numbered, cities like Stockholm and Strasbourg, France,are scrambling to lure its team of experts, who license drugs and monitor their use for safety. But the uncertainty has left the agency\u2019s executive director, Guido Rasi, \u201cvery worried\u201d as experts start to quit and others are recruited away.\u201cThe consequence, and the direct impact on the public health, is my main concern,\u201d Mr. Rasi said, in a room overlooking London\u2019s old docks. Among its tasks, the agency oversees a globalized supply chain for drugs in liaison with other international regulators.\u201cImagine if we are late in reaction for some crisis, something going wrong, something unexpected, some quality issue,\u201d he added. \u201cIf we are not in a position to intervene fast and efficiently,\u201d he added, \u201cthat is a serious threat to public health.\u201dThough not critical yet, he said, the staff problems have grown since the referendum on Britain\u2019s exit from the bloc, known as Brexit. Mr. Rasi has already lost half a dozen experts from the agency\u2019s 890 staff members, a noticeable number after years when resignations were rare. While well-qualified experts are being courted with job offers, uncertainty is making it difficult to attract replacements.Most worrisome is an internal assessment suggesting that relocating the agency might mean losing up to half its personnel. That would be a big setback. In two decades, the agency has authorized about 1,000 products for use across the 28-nation European Union plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.With a full workload of applications in the pipeline, the organization is already close to the breaking point, Mr. Rasi said. If it loses more than 15 percent of its experts, he added, the agency will probably not be able to maintain current schedules for licensing new drugs and monitoring existing ones.Some pharmaceutical companies are worried, too. Moving the agency would cause \u201ctremendous disruption,\u201d said Andrew Witty, the chief executive of Britain\u2019s biggest drug maker, GlaxoSmithKline.\u201cThis is a regulator who is keeping an eye on the health and safety of hundreds of millions of Europeans,\u201d Mr. Witty told Bloomberg TV. \u201cYou don\u2019t want them with their eye off the ball.\u201dLittle of this impinged on the acrimonious campaign ahead of Britain\u2019s vote on June 23 to quit the bloc, during which the agency\u2019s future \u2014 or that of the European Banking Authority, which is also in London \u2014 was barely mentioned.With the implications of Brexit sinking in, there are fears of a broader threat to Britain\u2019s life sciences sector.\u201cProximity does still matter, and the fact that the E.M.A. is here has made a difference,\u201d Daniel Zeichner, a lawmaker for Britain\u2019s opposition Labour Party, said. \u201cThis is a globally competitive industry, and we are really good at it, but it can go elsewhere.\u201dMr. Zeichner, whose Cambridge constituency has a large life sciences sector, also fears that Brexit could increase the cost of drug authorizations and slow access to new medicines for Britons.Some hope that the disruption can be avoided, and that the agency might remain where it is, with Britain continuing to participate. That seems plausible only if Britain seeks a very close relationship with the European Union, as Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein did. But those countries agreed to be integrated into the single market, accepting free movement of people as well as goods, capital and services. Prime Minister Theresa May argues that Britons voted against such open borders, and is likely to resist that move.Outside the bloc, Britain might opt to duplicate the agency\u2019s work, but at a significant cost. Drug companies might require two authorizations for new products \u2014 one British, one European \u2014 pushing up the prices of medicine.For the European Medicines Agency, Brexit creates scientific as well as logistical problems. It works closely with Britain\u2019s domestic authority, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, and British experts take the lead in assessing about one-fifth of drug authorizations considered by the European counterpart.If British experts withdraw after Brexit, burdens on other European nations will increase.But for Mr. Rasi, his staff members and their families, uncertainty over the headquarters is the biggest issue, one that lies in the hands of the European Union\u2019s heads of state and government.The European Medicines Agency, for example, has an annual budget of a little over $300 million and generates significant revenue. Most weekdays its experts fill 350 London hotel rooms.When the European Food Safety Authority was up for grabs, Silvio Berlusconi, then the prime minister of Italy, blocked Finland\u2019s bid to host it, saying, \u201cThe Finns don\u2019t even know what prosciutto is.\u201d The organization eventually went instead to Parma, Italy.Mr. Rasi hopes for a quick decision and that any new location has good transport links and infrastructure. The competition promises to be fierce.\u201cThat is the only nice side of the story,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems we are very popular. They all like us; they all want us.\u201dAdvertisement"}

This is worth celebrating, even as the Chernobyl accident itself must be mourned and studied for the hubris and failure it represents.The saga of Chernobyl is well known \u2014 the ill-advised test of some safety systems in the early hours of April 26, 1986, that went terribly wrong, turning Reactor No. 4 into a volcano of deadly radioactivity that reached Poland and Scandinavia; the initial attempts of Soviet authorities to play down the catastrophe, followed by the heroic efforts of firefighters and untold thousands of Soviet workers to throw a concrete and steel casing, called the sarcophagus, over the deadly ruins, a casing that developed cracks almost from the outset. An area the size of Rhode Island around the reactor, including the ghost town of Pripyat, remains off limits to this day.Chernobyl has been used as an argument against nuclear power, especially in Germany, but it shouldn\u2019t be. Modern reactors have extensive safeguards against the kind of meltdown that happened in Reactor No. 4, which lacked sufficient containment structures.While nuclear energy, responsibly harnessed, remains for now a viable alternative to climate-changing fossil fuels, the Chernobyl arch stands as a dramatic monument to a catastrophe\u2019s consequences, stretching far into the future. And it speaks, too, to what nations can do in the face of disaster if they join together.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Founder of Odwalla Tries to Recapture His Mojo", "Date": "2016-12-17", "News": "Supported by\u201cOdwalla took him to the top of the world and then to the bottom,\u201d said Berne Evans, his business partner today. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever gotten over it.\u201dToday it\u2019s possible for a company to develop a drink and cut a deal with an assembly line for hire to produce it, and negotiate another deal for someone to distribute it. Just a decade ago, it required far more capital and, eventually, a sprawling operation.Only a few years after its founding, in 2012, Califia is on track to ring up $100 million in sales and is adding products at a fast clip. The company is considered one of the hottest young brands in the beverage world, leading to whispers about whether one of the big competitors will soon swoop in with a buyout offer that Mr. Steltenpohl and his partners can\u2019t refuse.Not this time, he insists. \u201cI\u2019ve had to sell out once,\u201d Mr. Steltenpohl said. \u201cThat was enough.\u201dThat\u2019s easier to say than to do. A little more than a month ago, Ben Weiss, the founder of the flavored water company Bai, also brushed back talk of a buyout. \u201cIt\u2019s called Bai, not Sell,\u201d he said in an interview at the time.His argument was not unique these days. He had already teamed up to a degree with one competitor. The company\u2019s drinks, which it called \u201cenhanced waters,\u201d got some distribution from Dr Pepper. And Bai was outselling a competitor in retail stores: Over the previous 12 weeks, Bai had outsold Vitaminwater, a Coke brand, for the first time, Mr. Weiss said.It was on track for $300 million in annual sales, outselling Pepsi and Coke on Amazon, internet sales that help many young beverage companies extend their reach to far corners of the country without giant distribution networks.There are more opportunities for young drinks companies than ever, as consumers who have abandoned sugary and diet sodas search for alternatives to plain water. Hint Inc., for instance, is on track to ring up $90 million in sales this year, having leveraged its early distribution in Google\u2019s cafeterias into shelf space at Whole Foods, Target and other stores.Last month, Cason Thorsby, a newly minted entrepreneur in Detroit, began selling in restaurants, bars and groceries there a line of sugar-free, naturally flavored, \u201csuperinfused\u201d sodas branded with his first name. And new juice businesses like OnJuice, Misfit Juicery and Roots Juices, many of which start out selling their products online, come to life every month, or so it seems.Duane Stanford, the editor of Beverage Digest, said a young beverage company today can buy its flavors from a flavor house, branding expertise from a branding expert and manufacturing from a producer on contract.\u201cYou have this situation where these companies can become viable, robust, cash-generating businesses without the help of a big company,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re even getting creative at building independent distribution networks.\u201dOdwalla came together out of a necessity to eat. After graduating from Stanford with a degree in environmental sciences, Mr. Steltenpohl joined with some friends to start a band called the Stance. He also got hooked on the taste of fresh-squeezed orange juice, which his father made for him.\u201cWe were a band of musicians who weren\u2019t really that accomplished \u2014 or popular,\u201d Mr. Steltenpohl said of himself and the band members, who became his partners in Odwalla. \u201cWe were broke and starving, and we figured if we started a juice business, we could live off the juice and maybe make a little extra.\u201dHe read a book, \u201c100 Businesses You Can Start For $100,\u201d and the partners invested in a juicer and started making juice. They didn\u2019t even try to break into groceries and convenience stores, instead stocking refrigerators in video stores and laundromats with Odwalla fresh juice each day. \u201cEveryone who was a musician back then was basically living out of a VW bus,\u201d Mr. Steltenpohl said. \u201cWe quit living in ours and began selling juice out of the back.\u201dFor most of its early years, the Santa Cruz Community Credit Union financed the company. But as consumers cottoned on to its intensely flavored, wacky mixes of unpasteurized juice, it needed something more.A friend introduced Mr. Steltenpohl to Bill Hambrecht, a founder of Hambrecht & Quist, the investment bank that financed some of Silicon Valley\u2019s early start-ups. Hambrecht & Quist became Odwalla\u2019s first institutional investor, and Mr. Hambrecht began serving as a sort of consigliere. \u201cHe helped us understand that anarchy isn\u2019t the best business model,\u201d Mr. Steltenpohl said.In 1993, Hambrecht & Quist helped take Odwalla public, which allowed it to expand nationally and into Canada. By 1996, it had roughly $60 million in sales, a new plant and refrigerated delivery trucks to replace the VW vans.Then the music stopped.\u201cI got a call from the King County department of health,\u201d Mr. Steltenpohl whispered, tearing up at the memory. \u201cFive or six people in Seattle had come down with what looked like E. coli poisoning, and the common element was apple juice, our apple juice.\u201dIn the end, at least 66 people got sick after drinking Odwalla juice, and a child died. The brand\u2019s claims about the healthiness came back to haunt it as reporters dug into its failure to heed warnings about food-safety lapses.Odwalla ended up in the hands of private equity groups, and when it became apparent that the goal was to sell the company to Coca-Cola, Mr. Steltenpohl left.\u201cFor Coke, the thinking was fresh juice is becoming important, we need a fresh juice, Odwalla will fill that need,\u201d he said. \u201cThey never saw the enormous potential of the Odwalla brand and instead saw it as just another product in the juice portfolio.\u201d(Scott Williamson, a spokesman for Coke, said that Odwalla is an important part of what the company calls its \u201cnatural healthy beverages portfolio and that Coke would continue to invest in marketing and new products to grow the brand.\u201d)Mr. Steltenpohl then teamed up with Dee Hock, the founder of Visa, and started a payment system that rewarded loyalty to local businesses.Then he collaborated with an African entrepreneur to develop Adina, a hibiscus tea business now owned by a Mexican beverage company. \u201cIt was a pretty ambitious project to source hibiscus from a women\u2019s co-op in Africa and make it into teas,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a lot of prejudice, and it was difficult to get any margin on the product \u2014 it was so idealistic.\u201dMr. Steltenpohl was charged with building and operating the plant that would squeeze the misfit fruit into juice. But just as construction began on the plant in Bakersfield, Calif., Mr. Evans\u2019s partner in Cuties, the agricultural group now known as the Wonderful Company, backed out. \u201cWithout its clementines to run the plant, we couldn\u2019t run it efficiently,\u201d Mr. Evans said. \u201cIn other words, we overbuilt the plant.\u201dSo Mr. Steltenpohl returned to an idea he had toyed with many years before.Shortly after the E. coli contamination, Odwalla had tried selling a product called Future Shake that was made from almonds, oats and soy. But its texture was too thick, and it never took off.\u201cAt that point, I really wasn\u2019t thinking of returning to the company at all,\u201d he said.But after the surgery, the hospital gave him a protein beverage to aid in his recovery, and the ingredients in it were so bad that he decided he had to make Califia work.The first batch of almond milk rolled off the production line in 2012 and quickly took off.The product had the advantage of its own production facility and what Mr. Steltenpohl had learned about distribution while at Odwalla. It also had the advantage of a far different retail landscape. When the Odwalla crisis hit, Amazon was in its infancy, and Whole Foods, which often serves as a sort of ambassador for new food and beverage brands, had just a handful of stores.Today, Amazon is putting up its own grocery stores, and Whole Foods has nearly 500 stores. At the same time, convenience stores have become much bigger points of distribution for a wide variety of drinks.And consumers are abandoning traditional soft drinks, both sugared and diet, in droves and searching for new flavors delivered in new ways.In the last year, Mr. Steltenpohl has pushed almond milk drinks flavored with things like ginger, mocha and matcha. More recently, Califia is putting the almond milk into cold-brewed and nitrogen-infused coffees, a technique borrowed from the beer business. The nitrogen imparts a sweetness to coffee, helping to reduce the amount of sugar needed. According to data from Euromonitor, bottled coffee is one of the fastest growing beverage categories in America, and Califia\u2019s cold-brewed version outsells the packaged Starbucks version.Mr. Steltenpohl is also trying to avoid past mistakes. The plant is equipped with cutting-edge food-safety monitors that share alerts about problems as they happen with the entire senior management team. Josh Butt, who previously oversaw food safety systems at Danone, the big French dairy company, presides over the plant\u2019s operations.In the year ended Sept. 4, Califia\u2019s sales more than doubled, hitting $85 million, according to data from IRI, which does not include the bottled coffee.In other words, the company is big enough to be attractive to a larger player.\u201cAs for big-brand interest, it would be accurate to say there has already been substantial interest \u2014 but as I\u2019ve said, I really don\u2019t want to go that route of selling while the company is so relatively young,\u201d Mr. Steltenpohl said. \u201cFinding ways to continue to grow the company into a major brand with a high degree of independence is a major lifelong objective.\u201dPrivate equity groups have also come calling. One year ago, the Stripes Group, a Manhattan-based private equity group that has a stake in the food delivery service Blue Apron, among other businesses, put up $50 million for a little less than 20 percent of Califia\u2019s stock, giving the company a value of more than $250 million.Mr. Steltenpohl and his executive team have options giving them the right to as much as a quarter of the company, and Mr. Evans owns the rest \u2014 a majority of the business \u2014 but \u201cit\u2019s really Greg\u2019s company,\u201d he said, adding that he was in no hurry to exit his investment. (Mr. Evans declined to comment on whether he earned money from the Stripes Group transaction.)That said, the tried-and-true endgame of selling out to a big competitor could prove too inviting, particularly in the wake of Danone\u2019s purchase of WhiteWave this year.The advantages that deal brought to WhiteWave have caused some sleepless nights for Mr. Steltenpohl, even though sales of his competitor\u2019s almond milk have been flat. Danone has the wherewithal to pay slotting fees to supermarkets to bump products into prime positions on the refrigerated shelves, regardless of how well they are selling.\u201cThat makes it harder for us younger dogs,\u201d Mr. Steltenpohl said.But he said chains like Target and Kroger are relying more on what he called \u201cfact based\u201d assessment to determine where they put products on their shelves. And he hints that Califia will introduce a \u201ccultured product\u201d some time next year \u2014 read: something probiotic. Which may just give Danone reason to watch its back.Advertisement"}

I extend my warmest greetings to the members of the Swedish Academy and to all of the other distinguished guests in attendance tonight.I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t be with you in person, but please know that I am most definitely with you in spirit and honored to be receiving such a prestigious prize. Being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature is something I never could have imagined or seen coming. From an early age, I\u2019ve been familiar with and reading and absorbing the works of those who were deemed worthy of such a distinction: Kipling, Shaw, Thomas Mann, Pearl Buck, Albert Camus, Hemingway. These giants of literature whose works are taught in the schoolroom, housed in libraries around the world and spoken of in reverent tones have always made a deep impression. That I now join the names on such a list is truly beyond words.I don\u2019t know if these men and women ever thought of the Nobel honor for themselves, but I suppose that anyone writing a book, or a poem, or a play anywhere in the world might harbor that secret dream deep down inside. It\u2019s probably buried so deep that they don\u2019t even know it\u2019s there.When I started writing songs as a teenager, and even as I started to achieve some renown for my abilities, my aspirations for these songs only went so far. I thought they could be heard in coffeehouses or bars, maybe later in places like Carnegie Hall, the London Palladium. If I was really dreaming big, maybe I could imagine getting to make a record and then hearing my songs on the radio. That was really the big prize in my mind. Making records and hearing your songs on the radio meant that you were reaching a big audience and that you might get to keep doing what you had set out to do.Well, I\u2019ve been doing what I set out to do for a long time now. I\u2019ve made dozens of records and played thousands of concerts all around the world. But it\u2019s my songs that are at the vital center of almost everything I do. They seem to have found a place in the lives of many people throughout many different cultures, and I\u2019m grateful for that.But there\u2019s one thing I must say. As a performer I\u2019ve played for 50,000 people and I\u2019ve played for 50 people and I can tell you that it is harder to play for 50 people. 50,000 people have a singular persona, not so with 50. Each person has an individual, separate identity, a world unto themselves. They can perceive things more clearly. Your honesty and how it relates to the depth of your talent is tried. The fact that the Nobel committee is so small is not lost on me.But, like Shakespeare, I too am often occupied with the pursuit of my creative endeavors and dealing with all aspects of life\u2019s mundane matters. \u201cWho are the best musicians for these songs?\u201d \u201cAm I recording in the right studio?\u201d \u201cIs this song in the right key?\u201d Some things never change, even in 400 years.My best wishes to you all, Bob Dylan.Advertisement"}

Tata had been trying unsuccessfully to extricate itself from making steel in Britain.In return, the unions have made substantial concessions including an agreement in principle to close their generous pension plan and replace it with a new one that would require employees to pay more for their future retirement.The deal comes as a relief for Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain. Tata\u2019s highly publicized troubles with high costs and cheaper imports have put many thousands of jobs at risk at a time when Britain\u2019s plans to leave the European Union are creating doubts about the future of the country\u2019s economy.The agreement \u201cmarks an important step forward in the journey to develop a sustainable future for our U.K. steel business,\u201d Koushik Chatterjee, the group executive director of Tata Steel, said in a statement.For months, Tata has been sounding out potential buyers, while at the same time negotiating with the unions. Those efforts evidently did not find an attractive price, leading Tata to reconsider.\u201cThey risked being embarrassed twice,\u201d said Dalton Dwyer, managing director of Industry Corporate Finance, a London-based firm that advises industrial companies on mergers. \u201cThey bought at the top of the market, and they didn\u2019t want to bail out at the bottom of the market.\u201dLoss of steel-making at the Port Talbot plant, which has two blast furnaces for making raw steel, would have been devastating to the economy of South Wales, a once-thriving industrial hub that has seen many high-paying jobs disappear in recent decades. Union officials say the deal will still need to be approved by their members.In addition, Tata\u2019s approach appeared to have changed after Cyrus Mistry, the parent group\u2019s chairman, was ousted earlier this fall and replaced with his predecessor, Ratan Tata. Mr. Tata had acquired the company\u2019s European assets, then called Corus, in 2007.Tata says it continues to talk to ThyssenKrupp, a German steel-making company, about combining the two companies\u2019 steel operations in a joint venture. Analysts say that ThyssenKrupp is more interested in working with Tata\u2019s Dutch operations than with their British counterparts.As part of Wednesday\u2019s announcement, Tata also said it would invest in plant upgrades, automation and other initiatives. The company declined to say how much money it would spend.Mr. Dwyer and other analysts say that there is reason for Tata executives to figure the fortunes of their British subsidiary might improve. British and European steel makers have been hammered in recent years by a of weak demand for their products and competition from imports from China and other countries.The European Union has slapped higher tariffs on some imported steel products, while Britain\u2019s plans to bolster spending on infrastructure, like a new runway for London\u2019s Heathrow Airport and a nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Southwest England, would stoke demand for steel.As by far Britain\u2019s largest steel producer, Tata could be well positioned.In his statement Mr. Chatterjee of Tata said that \u201cglobal economic uncertainty, slow manufacturing growth and currency volatility\u201d all presented \u201csignificant challenges to the business.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big Banks Fight to Block Crisis-Era Lawsuits From Continuing", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byBig banks are fighting tens of billions of dollars of potential legal costs linked to at least a dozen pending lawsuits arising from the financial crisis. Now they want the Supreme Court to weigh in, arguing that regulators took too long to file their claims.A handful of banks, including Wells Fargo, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank, have asked the Supreme Court to review a lower court decision that said the regulators filed their claims on time despite a Depression-era securities law that gave them only a three-year window.The Justice Department is pushing back. In a brief submitted last week, it says the banks\u2019 argument lacks merit and asked the court not to take up the case.Damages related to some $37.5 billion in securities are at stake in the pending lawsuits, the banks say, in addition to billions of dollars in disputed prejudgment interest. That sum includes nearly $32 billion for cases in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which most commonly decides securities cases. The banks say these lawsuits should have been barred under the strict three-year window and extensions should not have been allowed. The Second Circuit voted 2-to-1 against the banks last May.\u201cIn terms of financial crisis litigation, the stakes are enormous,\u201d said Robert Giuffra, a partner at Sullivan & Cromwell and lead attorney for the banks. \u201cIf there\u2019s a future downturn and the federal banking agencies want to start bringing lawsuits, they would get the benefit of this favorable decision.\u201dThe case involves the August 2009 failure of the Colonial Bank of Montgomery, Ala. The bank had $25 billion in assets and its collapse was among the largest in American history. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation later sued the institutions that issued or underwrote the roughly $300 million in mortgage-backed securities purchased by Colonial that led to its ruin, arguing that the disclosures on those securities contained false information or misrepresentations about the health of the underlying mortgages.The government argues that the lawsuits were timely under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act, a 1980s law coming out of the savings and loan crisis that provides the F.D.I.C., when acting as a receiver, additional time to bring claims to court by overriding other statutes of limitations. Nearly identical provisions exist for regulators overseeing credit unions and mortgages.The banks say the F.D.I.C., along with the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the National Credit Union Administration, has incorrectly relied on so-called extender provisions to bring cases to court years after certain troubled securities were sold.They point to the Securities Act of 1933, which imposes the stricter three-year deadline, called a statute of repose. They argue that the extender provision does not explicitly override such statutes. The intent of the deadline is to provide greater certainty to financial institutions about when they are exposed to costly litigation.Regulators filed their lawsuit over Colonial in August 2012, which the banks contend was about five years after Colonial purchased the securities.A lower federal court judge sided with the industry in 2014 before the Second Circuit panel split, 2 to 1, in favor of the government last May. The appeals court found that Firrea does supersede all applicable time limits, including statutes of repose.The appellate court correctly held that the Firrea extender provision \u201cestablishes the sole time limit applicable to suits brought by the F.D.I.C. as receiver,\u201d the government\u2019s brief filed last week says. \u201cThat holding does not conflict with any decision of this court or of another court of appeals.\u201d\u201cTo the contrary,\u201d the brief adds, \u201cit is consistent with the unanimous view of all of the other appellate courts, including the Fifth, Ninth and Tenth Circuits, that have considered the issue\u201d under the extender provision \u201cor under virtually identical provisions governing suits by other federal entities.\u201dA F.D.I.C. spokesman, David Barr, declined to comment on the case.The financial industry has previously petitioned the Supreme Court twice to hear related cases, and has been denied both times. The court receives thousands of petitions every year, and the odds of being granted a hearing are generally very low.\u201cThere is nothing about the CTS decision that suggested that it would apply only to that particular statute and that the principles that were announced there shouldn\u2019t be of general application,\u201d said Michael Dell, a partner at the law firm Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel, who is representing several trade groups in the case.The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, the American Bankers Association and the Clearing House Association together filed a brief in support of the banks\u2019 petition in November.The earlier petitions to the high court, the banks say, included key differences: One was filed shortly after the CTS decision, before there was a record of how lower courts would respond, and the another dealt with a state statute of repose, not the federal securities law at issue in the current lawsuit.The government argues that no new issues have come to light that require further examination.\u201cThis court has twice denied petitions for writs of certiorari that raised essentially the same arguments as this one,\u201d the Justice Department says in its brief. \u201cPetitioners identify no changed circumstance that would warrant a different result here.\u201dCritics who would like to see the banks pay for their actions urge the court to focus on the broader policy considerations stemming from the crash.\u201cThose who were most guilty of causing the financial crash in 2008 have fought tooth and nail to avoid being held responsible \u2014 and they have been wildly successful at doing that,\u201d said Dennis Kelleher, president and chief executive of Better Markets, an advocacy group focused on financial markets. \u201cOne of the reasons we\u2019re seeing political earthquakes in the U.S. is the lack of accountability on Wall Street.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The physicist Enrico Fermi said scientists possessed \u201cno proprietary rights\u201d to their creations.Staggering prices lead some health professionals to conclude that profit making has at times turned into profiteering, at the expense of people who could not be more vulnerable.Pharmaceutical companies, however, respond that in certain cases, a high price for that 4-cent drug is essential if the first $400 million pill is ever to be produced. Clinical trials are expensive, and failure is routine. Many drugs never make it to market.Also, the companies say, many patients pay nowhere near the full price because of discounts and insurance benefits. Then, too, patents are not forever. Often, a manufacturer has maybe eight to 10 years to turn a profit before its patent expires and the drug may be produced in generic form at a significantly lower price. And profits, the industry adds, are what pay for the costly experimentation that may yield the next miracle.The emphasis on sales would not surprise anyone who watches the evening news. On the major broadcast networks, viewers are typically 60 and older. Accordingly, advertising amounts to a litany of age-related indignities. Kantar Media\u2019s list of the most-advertised prescription drugs is led by Humira, to treat rheumatoid arthritis; Lyrica, for nerve pain; Eliquis, an anti-clotting medication; Cialis, for erectile dysfunction; and Xeljanz, also for rheumatoid arthritis.A year ago, the American Medical Association urged a ban on these sorts of direct pitches to consumers, but congressional action seems unlikely. Even so, the government\u2019s stake in the drug industry is considerable. A good deal of basic research is financed by American taxpayers, through institutions like the National Institutes of Health.Under the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, named for Senators Birch Bayh and Bob Dole, private companies are authorized to obtain patents for a variety of products developed with public money, pharmaceuticals among them. The assumption is that these firms are better positioned than the government to bring innovations to market.Mr. Shkreli, who faces criminal charges on a separate matter, defended his actions at a health forum last year. \u201cIt\u2019s a business,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to make as much money as possible.\u201d But not everyone regards lifesaving drugs as just another product ripe for exploitation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Oklahoma Newspaper Endorsed Clinton. It Hasn\u2019t Been Forgiven.", "Date": "2016-12-26", "News": "Supported byENID, Okla. \u2014 One Sunday after church, Jeff Mullin and his wife were in line at the Western Sizzlin steakhouse here when a man, fists clenched, threatened to beat the hell out of him.\u201cMy first thought was just to kind of try to keep things calm. Otherwise, it was going to be two old guys rolling around on the floor of the steakhouse, and that would be pretty unseemly,\u201d recalled Mr. Mullin, 64, the mustachioed senior writer for Enid\u2019s daily newspaper, The Enid News & Eagle.The dispute was not personal. It was, of all things, editorial.It was the first Democratic endorsement for president in the modern history of the newspaper, which was founded in 1893. As the man\u2019s reaction at the steakhouse suggested, Enid was stunned, and this slow-paced agricultural town of 52,000 near the Kansas state line has not been the same since.The News & Eagle, with a circulation of 10,000, lost 162 subscribers who canceled the paper. Eleven advertisers pulled their ads, including a funeral home that had a sizable account. Someone stuck a \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d bumper sticker on the glass doors of the paper\u2019s downtown office. A man left a late-night message on the publisher\u2019s voice mail, expressing his hope that readers would deliver, to put it delicately, a burning sack of steaming excrement to the paper.Yet for the most part, the fallout at those large metropolitan newspapers was short-lived and barely noticed. The Star-Telegram\u2019s editorial in October, \u201cSay No to Trump,\u201d led to more than 100 canceled subscriptions, less than one-tenth of 1 percent of its circulation.In Enid, however, sentiment about the endorsement lingers weeks after the election.Days after the editorial, Paul Allen, 81, one of Enid\u2019s most prominent residents \u2014 he financed construction of the ballpark downtown \u2014 stepped into the paper\u2019s offices on Broadway. He walked past the statue of an eagle in the lobby and canceled his 43-year-old subscription at the front desk. He might have done it sooner, but hesitated because he knows the publisher, Jeff L. Funk, whom he sees at weekly Rotary Club meetings.\u201cI like Jeff a lot,\u201d said Mr. Allen, a co-founder of a meat processing company that is the largest private employer in town. \u201cThat was one reason I debated it, because I didn\u2019t want to offend him.\u201cI wasn\u2019t gloating over it,\u201d he continued. \u201cI just felt like it was kind of my duty almost. When I saw that headline, I was shocked. It was sickening to me.\u201dThe News & Eagle\u2019s 730-word editorial showed the raw power of partisanship in small-town America, the extraordinary divisions exposed in this election and the surprising ways in today\u2019s digital media age that newspaper endorsements still have the power to generate a reaction, even if they don\u2019t necessarily change people\u2019s votes.\u201cThere used to be a saying that the editorial page was the soul of a newspaper, and if that\u2019s the case, we\u2019ve got a lot of weak-souled newspapers in the country because they\u2019re afraid to offend anybody,\u201d said Terry M. Clark, the director of the Oklahoma Journalism Hall of Fame and a professor of journalism at the University of Central Oklahoma in Edmond. \u201cThis is an excellent example of the way American journalism ought to be \u2014 standing for something \u2014 and, man, it takes guts to do that in Enid, Okla.\u201dThe News & Eagle, which urged readers in the Republican primary to support Senator Marco Rubio for president, stands by its endorsement of Mrs. Clinton. But it has also been busy doing damage control.One reader who stopped taking the paper said it was still trying to woo him back by delivering an occasional copy to his doorstep. The executive editor, Rob Collins, has worked the phones, talking to subscribers who had canceled or threatened to do so.\u201cI talked a lot of people off the ledge,\u201d said Mr. Collins, who grew up in Enid and whose father was a respected car salesman. \u201cPeople knew my dad or know my mom and know my family here. A lot of people who were angry called expecting me to argue right back with them. Really, the only time I would raise my voice is when I would get cursed at or yelled at, which I don\u2019t really like.\u201cI hope people can respect that we\u2019re entitled to our opinion, too, and that that can be different from news,\u201d he added.The editorial took shape from notes that Mr. Funk, the publisher, supplied to Mr. Collins. Mr. Collins refined the notes and was the primary author of the endorsement, which was debated and approved by the paper\u2019s seven-member editorial board. The paper\u2019s corporate parent, Community Newspaper Holdings Inc., which is based in Alabama and owns newspapers and websites in 23 states, also played a role.\u201cIt was our decision at the corporate level, which of course was made known to all of our papers, that Donald Trump did not meet our company and journalism values, particularly as they related to the First Amendment,\u201d said Bill Ketter, the senior vice president for news.Asked if the Enid editorial board had the freedom to endorse Mr. Trump, he replied: \u201cLet me put it this way. We would have been disappointed. Did we demand that they do something? No, we didn\u2019t do that. We set out our principles and our standards.\u201dEnid is roughly 100 miles north of Oklahoma City, and people here still like to debate whether the town gets its name from a character in a Tennyson poem or, according to urban legend, from a joke played on an old chuck wagon sign. (Enid is, after all, \u201cDine\u201d spelled backward.) The jets from Vance Air Force Base fly so low that residents like to say they can read the markings on the bottoms of the aircraft.\u201cI\u2019m unhappy with the whole media,\u201d said Jody Traynor, 67, a four-decade subscriber who stopped taking the paper after the endorsement. \u201cAll of them. They lean too much. They\u2019re supposed to just tell me the news and let me decide.\u201d\u201cWe gained one subscriber out of the endorsement editorial,\u201d Mr. Funk said. \u201cWe lost 162, but we gained one.\u201d\u201cLooking back on it, I think it was all talk, but at the time I thought there was a possibility that he might take a swing at me,\u201d said Mr. Mullin, a member of the editorial board. \u201cAnd I thought this is crazy. This is a newspaper endorsement. Some of the people almost seemed hurt. Like, \u2018How can my newspaper\u2019 \u2014 in a small town like this, it\u2019s their newspaper \u2014 \u2018do this to me?\u2019 I think there was almost a sense of betrayal.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption misstated the given name of the senior reporter for The Enid News & Eagle who had a run-in with a man over the newspaper\u2019s endorsement of Hillary Clinton. The reporter\u2019s name is Jeff Mullin, not John.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin Is Waging Information Warfare. Here\u2019s How to Fight Back.", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorHow can countries protect themselves from such methods? As with nuclear weapons, deterrence is better than confrontation. The United States and its allies in the West need to find a way to discourage Russia, the leading practitioner of this kind of political warfare, from striking first.With nuclear weapons, deterrence relies on demonstrating the possession of similar capabilities \u2014 and the will to use them. This won\u2019t work with political warfare.What Russia\u2019s president fears is failure. His macho political persona relies on the conceit that he never gets things wrong, and that he can, with the help of hackers, special forces or brutal allies, outmaneuver the West and consequently regain Russia\u2019s status as a global power.This is why the United States and its allies should pursue a strategy of deterrence by denial. Mr. Putin shouldn\u2019t fear retaliation for his information warfare \u2014 he should fear that he will fail.There are several ways to go about this. First, United States institutions need better cybersecurity defenses. Political parties and major newspapers are now targets just as much as the power grid and the Pentagon are. The government has to help provide security when it can \u2014 but people have a duty to be more vigilant and recognize that their cybersecurity is about protecting the country, not just their own email accounts. The leaked emails of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta, revealed how easily hackers fooled intelligent political operatives with phishing attacks.Instead of trying to combat each leak directly, the United States government should teach the public to tell when they are being manipulated. Via schools and nongovernmental organizations and public service campaigns, Americans should be taught the basic skills necessary to be savvy media consumers, from how to fact-check news articles to how pictures can lie.But the United States also needs to declare in advance, and with evident resolve, the kinds of actions it would take in response to certain political attacks. Russia has been taking advantage of the weaknesses and freedoms of the West, so the West should similarly strike back against Russia\u2019s vulnerabilities.For example, punitive measures like sanctions can be a very powerful weapon against the opportunist kleptocrats on whom Mr. Putin relies for support. Media owners whose networks spread disinformation, members of Parliament who cultivate extremists, and oligarchs who allow themselves to be used as Kremlin front men should all be fair game. Treating them like members of an organized crime syndicate would allow Washington to freeze not only their assets, but also those of their families, and bar them from entry.The West also needs to stand together against the Kremlin\u2019s divide-and-rule tactics. NATO members are committed by treaty to defending one another from military attacks, but there aren\u2019t similar provisions for cyberattacks or information warfare. Many smaller countries hesitate to play their part in fighting Russian espionage and subversion \u2014 whether expelling spies or closing front organizations \u2014 because they fear Russia\u2019s inevitable retaliation. The United States needs to promise its allies it will support them.Finally, Mr. Putin\u2019s own vanity could be turned into a weapon against him. Every time he overreaches, the American government should point it out. Every time he fails, we need to say so loudly and clearly. We should tell jokes about him. He can rewrite the record in Russia, but the West does not have to contribute to his mythmaking \u2014 and we should stop building him up by portraying him as a virtual supervillain.All of this requires a new mind-set. It means accepting that Russia has chosen to be at war with us \u2014 albeit a special and limited war. Russia needs to be treated as a political combatant.It also means remembering how much stronger the United States is than Russia, economically, militarily, diplomatically and even politically. Mr. Putin is a geopolitical guerrilla who has adopted a strategy he hopes can play to his own strengths and circumvent the West\u2019s. Now the West needs to demonstrate that it has a strategy to combat his adventurism.Mark Galeotti is a senior researcher at the Institute of International Relations Prague.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Chiefs Notably Absent From Trump\u2019s Cabinet of Business Advisers", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byIn President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s newly named kitchen cabinet of business advisers, Wall Street is in. Silicon Valley is out.Mr. Trump has named 16 business leaders to serve on what\u2019s being called the President\u2019s Strategic and Policy Forum, described as a group meant to guide his administration on economic matters.The list is notable for leaning toward New York executives and industries \u2014 finance in particular. The list echoes Mr. Trump\u2019s picks for a number of major economic positions, including Treasury secretary (the former Goldman Sachs partner and hedge fund manager Steven T. Mnuchin) and commerce secretary (the billionaire investor Wilbur L. Ross).Given his long experience as a New York real estate investor, Mr. Trump\u2019s selections may not come as a surprise.\u201cDonald comes from the financial services world. I think he tends to pick people who he\u2019s comfortable with,\u201d Stephen A. Schwarzman, the co-founder and chief executive of the Blackstone Group, who is leading the forum effort, told CNBC Friday afternoon.It is a bipartisan list, nonetheless, with a number of members who traditionally have favored Democratic candidates, including Laurence D. Fink of the asset management colossus BlackRock, Mary T. Barra of General Motors and Robert Iger of Walt Disney.\u201cThis forum brings together C.E.O.s and business leaders who know what it takes to create jobs and drive economic growth,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement. \u201cMy administration is committed to drawing on private sector expertise.\u201dThe group is expected to meet with Mr. Trump monthly. The first meeting will be at the White House in early February. Mr. Schwarzman will serve as chairman.Mr. Schwarzman was not a vocal supporter or fund-raiser for Mr. Trump. Since the election, however, he has embraced the notion that the president-elect\u2019s promise to pull back financial regulations and cut taxes will supercharge the economy.In public and in private, Mr. Schwarzman has lately said that he is \u201cexcited\u201d about the potential for economic growth in a Trump administration.\u201cThere are going to be so many of these changes that I think what\u2019s going to happen, it\u2019s really going to force growth from a policy perspective,\u201d Mr. Schwarzman said at the conference.Despite his support for Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, Mr. Schwarzman has signaled privately that he would not commit to a full-time position in the administration, but was otherwise interested in helping to advise the president-elect.Other Wall Street heavyweights on the list are Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, and Adebayo Ogunlesi, a former Credit Suisse executive who is the chairman of the investment firm Global Infrastructure Partners. Mr. Ogunlesi is also a board member at Goldman Sachs. No Goldman executives were named to the forum.Forum members with ties to the finance industry include Paul S. Atkins, a former commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission who is now the chief executive of a finance regulation consulting firm, and Kevin Warsh, a former Morgan Stanley executive and a former governor of the Federal Reserve.Mr. Dimon is easier to understand. Though initially a supporter of President Obama, the JPMorgan chief has long been critical of the current administration\u2019s financial regulatory overhaul. While his name had been floated as a potential candidate for Treasury secretary, people close to him have insisted that he had no interest in taking on a full-time commitment outside of his bank.Aside from Virginia M. Rometty of IBM, there is hardly any representation of technology companies, and certainly none from Silicon Valley.Indeed, many Silicon Valley luminaries have opposed Mr. Trump since the presidential campaign. Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, was an enthusiastic supporter of both Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton.The rest of the advisory group appears to be a bipartisan mixture of business chiefs drawn from the worlds of finance, media and manufacturing. They include Ms. Barra, Mr. Iger, Doug McMillon of Walmart and W. James McNerney Jr., formerly of Boeing.Mr. Trump\u2019s style and speech are sometimes seen as throwbacks to the Reagan administration, and Mr. Welch was the iconic business leader of that era.Landon Thomas Jr. contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Friday Mailbag: Omissions, Exclusions, Language and Fox News", "Date": "2016-12-09", "News": "Supported byThe Public EditorLanguage choice in media (especially the NY Times) is extremely important and highly influential on our collective consciousness. I would like to point out that for many years the NY Times has had an inconsistent editorial policy on the use of the term \u201cassisted suicide\u201d and it has become a matter of great importance to clarify this issue. A physician\u2019s efforts to help terminally ill people bring their lives to a dignified conclusion should be referred to as \u201cassisted dying.\u201d This is not a minor semantic point. Presently there are four European countries that allow physicians to assist people who are not terminally ill in ending their lives. Canada has recently passed a yet to be implemented federal law that will also allow this practice. It appears from the experience in Europe that all cases of non-terminally ill people pursuing this assisted dying path have a major psychiatric disorder from which they are seeking relief. Unlike efforts to help terminally ill people this activity when applied to non-terminally ill people can legitimately be called \u201cassisted suicide\u201d and should be strongly condemned by all physicians and the health care establishment at large. My point is that there is a clear reason to distinguish the terms \u201cassisted dying\u201d and \u201cassisted suicide.\u201d The ethical, moral and public policy implications of making this distinction should make this a high priority for the NY Times editorial staff.Richard Krugley, Far Rockaway, N.Y.We asked the editor overseeing standards, Phil Corbett, whether The Times has had discussions around the term\u2019s use. He said, \u201cI\u2019m aware that there\u2019s debate over these terms, but we haven\u2019t come up with any style rules as of yet.\u201dHoward Brown, North Kingstown, R.I.In the piece, Kushner notes, \u201cI was invited on an extensive tour of the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and was asked to choose a subject to write about, for a book to be published next year.\u201d We asked the magazine\u2019s editor, Jake Silverstein, to talk about the story\u2019s provenance:The writers who are contributing pieces for the book are not being paid for their work. Their travel expenses are being covered through the advance that HarperCollins paid for the book. The editors of the book, the authors Michael Chabon and Ayelet Waldman, have worked with a number of individuals and organizations within Israel on this project. Among them is Breaking the Silence, which helped to administer some of those travel costs in the region, and which also made additional general contributions toward travel costs for Chabon and Waldman\u2019s project. Breaking the Silence had no direct involvement with Kushner\u2019s reporting or writing from Shuafat.Another reader also finds The Times\u2019s performance coming up short \u2014 though her complaint is not about the news coverage.When the reader tried to pay for her Times subscription, the online payment system refused to accept her last name. The reader notified The Times\u2019s customer service department, explaining, \u201cMy card is working and I think it goes without saying that my surname is too.\u201d But she got this reply: \u201cOur Credit Card system has a minimum of three characters for the first and last name.\u201d The reader then came to us.Are you or your colleagues aware of this \u201cglitch\u201d in the system that targets Asians far more than any other group \u2014 I am thinking only of those I know personally, besides myself, with surnames of \u201cinsufficient\u201d length (Ha, Lo, Le, Li, Ma, Oh, Si, Wu...). I reiterate that I think it is ridiculous.Aimee Ng, New York CityNg also noted that the problem has yet to be fixed, so we reached out to Eileen Murphy, the head of communications at The Times, for comment.\u201cFirst, this customer should have been responded to in a timely fashion, and we apologize that didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cClearly, this is a flaw in our system, one that we have prioritized fixing.\u201dThe downpour of mail on this subject this past week fell into two camps. One group appreciated that someone from The New York Times went on Fox to address the subject of media bias.As a dyed-in-the-wool conservative, I loved your interview on Fox. It made me want to buy a subscription to the NYT, and I think I\u2019ll get around to it. I am a true fan of 360 degrees of opinions on topics important to Americans. It sharpens the debate and makes all sides stronger. What an awesome institution you are a part of.Steve Kester, Duluth, Ga.Reminding your fellow reporters that reporting the news is their job, that\u2019s a great public service, Ms. Spayd. Years ago, I could read the Times and get both sides of the story, well-written and with little or no judgmental flavor. The country needs that newspaper back.Alfred Jones, Grass Valley, Calif.But another group was incensed that the public editor was even on the show, much less criticizing The Times. A firestorm erupted on Twitter, and some of the flames singed the public editor\u2019s inbox, too.Ms. Spayd did a real disservice to the NY Times and journalism by playing a bit role in Tucker Carlson\u2019s nonsense about NY Times reporters trying to influence the election. First of all, reporters are allowed to express their opinions in venues outside of news articles. Second, they had good cause to point out the myriad ways in which the lies and fake news swirling around and generated by the Trump campaign were not adequately covered by the Times.Paul Semenza, Santa Clara, Calif.Of course your opinions are legitimate. But Fox? I don\u2019t see it as a legit news outlet. And Tucker Carlson? Really? I\u2019m not alone in thinking he\u2019s become a low-grade propagandist\u2026.Jesse Kornbluth, New York CityLike many others, I am very disappointed to hear about Liz Spayd\u2019s criticism of some of the tweets from NYT reporters. If anything, the NYT, and other news organizations, have been way too lenient on Trump and his campaign officials, and gave him press to enable him to win the campaign. NYT reporters have the right to express their opinions on Twitter and speak the truth about Trump, and should be applauded for doing so, not pilloried on Fox News.Antoinette S. Kruckel, Brooklyn, N.Y.In the alternative universe of email fans \u2014 those surprised and pleased that I spoke honestly to conservatives \u2014 I\u2019m glad you listened and I\u2019m glad some expressed an interest in giving The Times another look. I\u2019m paid to be the house critic, but I will say to the reader who raised it, the work that\u2019s produced here is most definitely a public service.Till next week.Advertisement"}

Minaya, the former Mets general manager, watched as one player in particular dominated the opposition with an ease that an experienced scout like him can spot a mile away.The only difference this day was that the athlete in question was Minaya\u2019s 17-year-old son, Justin, and the sport he was playing was not baseball.\u201cI think this experience has shown me how great the basketball players are, how great the athletes are,\u201d Minaya, 58, said with a laugh.The experience Minaya was discussing \u2014 two years of watching Justin, a 6-foot-6-inch swingman, develop into a midmajor recruiting target \u2014 has also gotten Minaya thinking. His continuing education in the colorful, often intriguing, occasionally shady world of high school and A.A.U. basketball has opened his eyes not just to the parallels between elite baseball and basketball development, but also to the kind of talented athletes who more infrequently choose baseball as a career.\u201cI walk in and the first thing that I see, and I\u2019m a scout, I\u2019m a player-personnel guy, so anytime I walk into a stadium I\u2019m trained to look at talent,\u201d Minaya said. \u201cI walked into an A.A.U. event and I\u2019m saying to myself, I was like, \u2018Oh, my God.\u2019\u201cAs a baseball guy, I just kept saying, \u2018We\u2019re missing all the great athletes.\u2019 That\u2019s the first thing that came to my mind. It was like: \u2018Oh, my God. This guy could be a 6-6 pitcher. This guy could be a center fielder.\u2019\u201dMinaya attended the recent game between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Knicks at Madison Square Garden and, according to Justin, wondered aloud how LeBron James would perform on a baseball field. And when Omar Minaya sat behind the Kentucky bench for a recent game at the Barclays Center, he tried to imagine how Kentucky\u2019s potential one-and-done freshmen De\u2019Aaron Fox and Malik Monk would do on a diamond.\u201cThese are guys that can be marketed throughout the world,\u201d Minaya said, \u201cand we have to find a way to get them to baseball.\u201dBaseball acknowledges that this is a problem. One aspect is that only 8 percent of players on Major League Baseball rosters on opening day last season were African-American, well below levels in past decades and below the national population of roughly 14 percent.\u201cI think, in general, you always want the best athletes playing the sport that you love,\u201d A.

Preller, the San Diego Padres\u2019 general manager, said. \u201cSo I think from a baseball standpoint, there are obviously different skill sets on a baseball field versus on a basketball court, but in general, when you have really good athletes playing, those are exciting players that the fans want to come see play.\u201cAnd those are the guys, even when I\u2019m scouting, that you\u2019re drawn to.\u201dAs he trailed his son around the country to summer basketball tournaments, Minaya said, he also could not help but notice the growing similarities in the development structures of baseball and basketball. Both prioritize youth: A 17-year-old pitcher who can throw 90 miles per hour or more, for example, is more highly valued than an 18- or 19-year-old who can do the same, Minaya said, just as an N.B.A. team might see far more upside in a one-and-done freshman than it would in a seasoned college senior.What vexes Minaya is the increasing specialization of high school athletes, leading talented teenagers to limit their choice to one sport early in the process.\u201cI\u2019ve been drawn into it because my son has drawn me into this,\u201d Minaya said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s a perfect example: He can play baseball and basketball, and he said to me, \u2018Dad, I want to play basketball.\u2019\u201dThe second son of a Dominican father and a mother who is part Irish, part African-American and part Native American, Justin Minaya grew up hanging out at the batting cage at Mets games, or sitting in his father\u2019s box seat and dreaming of becoming the next Jose Reyes \u2014 except that he wanted to play center field.\u201cEvery chance I could go, I would ask my mom if we could drive up to the game,\u201d Justin said.A left-handed pitcher and center fielder, Justin played organized baseball through middle school. But by sixth grade, as Justin started to grow taller, basketball had replaced baseball, his first love. Now, Justin devotes his summers to basketball \u2014 A.A.U. mostly, as well as events with the Dominican Republic\u2019s under-17 national team \u2014 over organized baseball.That does not mean his father has given up hope that he will win him back one day; Minaya still tries to convince Justin of the value of making time to throw and take batting practice.\u201cThere are a lot of Justins out there,\u201d Minaya said. \u201cFor me, he stands out because I\u2019m a baseball guy. He\u2019s a baseball player. He\u2019s a left-handed pitcher. I always say: \u2018You\u2019re a lefty. You throw strikes. You got a chance.\u2019\u201dJustin is being recruited by basketball midmajors like Iona, Fairfield and North Carolina-Wilmington, although he has also heard from bigger programs like Indiana. He acknowledged that he had probably sacrificed some recruiting looks by staying at his local high school, but dismissed the trade-off by saying, \u201cI have more fun here.\u201dThe good news for Old Tappan\u2019s baseball coach, Tim Byron \u2014 and for Minaya, who knows the value of left-handed pitching \u2014 is that Justin is considering playing baseball for Old Tappan in the spring. It would be his first time on the roster.\u201cOh, I think it would be great,\u201d said Byron, who has known Justin and his older brother, Teddy, for years. \u201cI think it would be great for him, too. And I think it would be nice for Omar, too, just to have the kid play. Teddy played his senior year with us.\u201cWhether he does it or not, I think it would be pretty nice, a good feeling, a good way out. But it all really depends on how the basketball goes.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And who would be the real boss? Mr. King, a model? Mr. Swanhaus, a marketer? Or Ms. Radziwill, a Real Housewife on TV and real author?\u201cBut it has turned out that she knows her place in the world,\u201d Ms. Radziwill said.\u201cAnd she isn\u2019t needy, because what would she need?\u201d Mr. King said.\u201cShe gets to live in three one-bedroom apartments instead of one,\u201d Mr. Swanhaus added.Ms. Radziwill now has a boyfriend, Adam Kenworthy, a vegan chef who is fond of the dog too.\u201cI like her soft and fluffy, so I give her baths,\u201d he said.The other night, the \u201cco-parents,\u201d as they call themselves (never owners or masters), were lounging in Ms. Radziwill\u2019s well-appointed living room, which included one very important and now shredded French couch. It was previously owned by Lee Radziwill, Carole\u2019s mother-in-law from her marriage to Anthony, who died in 1999.But she gave herself to the arms of the others too, with the open-mindedness of an equal-opportunity pet that loves unstintingly and regardless of looks, age or number of followers.\u201cI always wanted a dog, but I didn\u2019t want one on my own,\u201d Mr. Swanhaus said.\u201cDogs don\u2019t like to be alone,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they are eminently flexible in dealing with new situations, and they can get bored with the same routine every day.\u201dWhat\u2019s good for dogs may also be good for humans, and not just by easing their responsibility. Brad Faulkner, a young New Yorker who works in finance, is one of four friends who once shared a dog in a Manhattan apartment and now have shared custody. Sugar, a Border collie and Labrador mix, spends summers in New York and the rest of the year in Los Angeles, where two of the four roommates have relocated.\u201cIt\u2019s actually a great way to keep a friendship going with people who have moved across the country,\u201d Mr. Faulkner said.Sometimes sharing custody of a dog can even rekindle romance.Andrea Arden, a dog trainer, was dating a man and sharing his Doberman. When they broke up, he offered visitation rights, leading to getting back together and then getting married. \u201cHe told me it was because we were soul mates,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think it had more to do with the dog.\u201dThey\u2019re now divorced and the dog is deceased, giving them a definitive ending.But custody can sometimes become a tricky issue. Jane Friedman, the chairman of Open Road Integrated Media, has taken in her son\u2019s dog, a Havanese, while he and his wife are dealing with a baby and toddler.

In fact, one might meet Baby, the dog shared by Mr. King, Ms. Radziwill and Mr. Swanhaus, and find her slightly ill mannered at times. But then, who isn\u2019t these days?\u201cHousebreaking her was in my kitchen, and it was a nightmare,\u201d Mr. Swanhaus said. The responsibility had fallen to him because his kitchen was larger than Mr. King\u2019s, and it didn\u2019t have a newly refinished floor like Ms. Radziwill\u2019s. The dog managed to climb the gate and destroy an expensive carpet.After that, Ms. Radziwill wanted to send Baby for rigorous boarding-school training. The others rejected her plan.

Mr. King and Ms. Radziwill (she contends that she shoulders the brunt of dog care, including vet visits and bills) keep a strict feeding schedule. Mr. Swanhaus, who the others are quick to point out has never bathed the dog (although he did once buy shampoo), leaves food out all day and doesn\u2019t stick with a rigid dog diet.\u201cHe\u2019s the one who doesn\u2019t always enforce the rules,\u201d Mr. King said.Rule No. 1 for the humans? Never drop the dog off at another apartment (always arranged by texting) without walking her first. Ms. Radziwill recently broke that one. \u201cIt was the only time I did that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I was so depressed after the election, I couldn\u2019t function.\u201dEvening was becoming night, and the team of co-parents seemed reluctant to leave their Baby and pull themselves together for a Saturday night. Mr. King went to set up an ironing board in Ms. Radziwill\u2019s kitchen to press a shirt to wear to a black-tie dinner at the home of Valentino Garavani.

Mr. de Blasio said that the building, run by a nonprofit in the Hunts Point neighborhood but financed by the city, used a low-pressure joint boiler system. Something caused the valve of the radiator in a room of the family\u2019s apartment to come off, he said. \u201cWe do not know whether it was something wrong with the manufacture of that unit, whether it was altered in some way,\u201d he said. Fire Department officials said that the broken valve may have caused steam to spew into the room where the two girls were as their father was in a separate room.Do radiators need to be inspected? Most steam radiators have two valves, according to Erik Gitli, owner and master plumber at Aladdin Plumbing Corp. in Brooklyn. \u201cThose can be checked periodically and replaced as needed.\u201dHe said it is not unusual to have minor problems with the valves, usually at the beginning of the season when radiators are turned on.Valve breakages can be caused by repeatedly using the valves to turn the radiators on or off or to control the room\u2019s temperature. \u201cThose valves tend to leak after doing that too many times,\u201d he said. If a valve completely breaks off, the room can fill with steam, creating condensation that can warp wood and damage paint. \u201cIt\u2019s like being in a steam room,\u201d Mr. Gitli said.Mr. de Blasio said that the apartment that the girls lived in had been inspected in the past month, but he did not specify the nature and extent of that inspection.Are malfunctioning radiators dangerous? Dr. James Gallagher, the director of the burn center at NewYork-Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center, said that he had never heard about a steam radiator causing a death. Injuries from radiators usually occur from contact with the heated metal. \u201cSomeone falls on it, rolls on it, touches it,\u201d Dr. Gallagher said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a hot iron.\u201dMr. Gitli said some parents cover their radiators with insulation to prevent such burns. He, too, had never heard of anyone dying from a steam radiator accident in his more than 20-year career. Nor had he heard about a serious injury caused by the sauna-like conditions that can result from a broken valve, though spewing steam could injure someone in proximity.The mayor sought to play down any fears about the safety of radiators. \u201cNo one has ever seen anything like this,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cWe do not see any precedent in anything that\u2019s happened before.\u201dThe rest of the building was inspected after the girls\u2019 deaths.What kind of injuries does steam cause?Steam can cause more severe burns than water because it may be superheated, but the severity of steam burns are usually lower than those caused by fire, Dr. Gallagher said. For children, burns from hot water, in particular scalding bath water, are more common, he said.The depth of the burn and the percentage of a person\u2019s body that is burned affect the likelihood of survival.\u201cTen percent burned, not so bad,\u201d Dr. Gallagher said. \u201cEighty percent burned you\u2019re going to be lucky to live.\u201dJ.

New York\u2019s Young Immigrants Uncertain Under Trump", "Date": "2016-12-15", "News": "Supported byVanessa Luna arrived in New York as a 10-year-old from Peru, and grew up as an undocumented immigrant. While her parents worked at cleaning jobs, she hid her status in high school until a guidance counselor helped her get into the State University of New York at Binghamton to study American history.She was a junior there when, in 2012, President Obama gave Ms. Luna \u2014 and hundreds of thousands of other young people like her\u2014 temporary permission to stay and work in the United States. She could become a teacher.\u201cFor the first time, I felt like this country accepted me,\u201d said Ms. Luna, 25, who now teaches social studies at a middle school on the Lower East Side.But now, she does not know what to think.During the presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump promised he would cancel the program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, that Mr. Obama initiated. But in comments he made to Time Magazine last week, the president-elect seemed to soften his stance.\u201cWe\u2019re going to work something out that\u2019s going to make people happy and proud,\u201d Mr. Trump said, without offering specifics, though a Senate bill with bipartisan sponsorship introduced last week would continue DACA\u2019s protections for three years.On that, Ms. Luna agreed. \u201cFor someone like me, that uncertainty still looms,\u201d she said.Across the country, more than 740,000 young immigrants, often called Dreamers, are wondering what will happen to the two-year work permits granted through DACA. They work in fields like education, law, medicine, finance and government. About 30,000 live and work in New York City, officials say.At the age of 5, Chandrapaul Latchman was brought by strangers on an airplane from Guyana to reunite with his parents on Long Island. He became student body president of Valley Stream Central High School, an honors student at Baruch College and an intern at BlackRock, the investment firm, before going to work at JPMorgan Chase. Today, at 23, he is one of the bank\u2019s 100 credit risk analysts, assessing multimillion-dollar loans to real estate developers and entertainment companies.He knows what he would feel were Mr. Trump to cancel the program, known as DACA.\u201cIt\u2019s a feeling of rejection,\u201d Mr. Latchman said.\u201cEven though you tried so hard, and outworked so many people to get here, still at the end, you\u2019re not good enough and they don\u2019t want you,\u201d he said.Because Mr. Obama initiated the program by executive action, Mr. Trump could still revoke it with the stroke of a pen. It does not need congressional approval.Without the right to work legally in the United States, the Dreamers could see the accouterments of middle-class life \u2014 a studio apartment in Brooklyn, a driver\u2019s license, a biweekly paycheck with deductions for retirement, a coveted desk in a financial firm \u2014 disappear.Some viewed Mr. Trump\u2019s latest comments as polarizing, continuing a narrative from his campaign.Otherwise, she said, the alternative is frightening: \u201cWe\u2019ll save DACA and all their parents will be deported \u2014 who will want to stay here?\u201dMr. Latchman said that even before Mr. Trump was elected, his manager suggested exploring other offices around the world, like the one in Toronto. His work permit expires in the summer of 2018, about the time his three-year contract with the bank ends.A JPMorgan Chase spokesman, Andrew Gray, said that it was too early to discuss what was still a hypothetical situation. He emphasized that Mr. Latchman was speaking personally, and not on behalf of the company.In many cases, employers, whether they are private or government entities, may not know if an employee has a work permit through DACA unless that person discloses it. And there is little any employer can do if an employee\u2019s work authorization is canceled.Antonio Vance, the executive director in New York for Great Oaks Charter School, said he had already consulted lawyers to help Ms. Luna.\u201cShe\u2019s only been here a year, and she\u2019s already a model teacher,\u201d Mr. Vance said. \u201cIt would be difficult to replace her and the relationships she has formed with her students.\u201dMs. Luna said that if were she to lose her work permit, she would consider going back to school for a degree in administration in hopes of one day opening her own school if the law changes. She already has a master\u2019s in urban education and policy.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t lie to say it won\u2019t devastate me. But it would ignite more of a fire inside me,\u201d she said, referring to her ambition to remain a teacher in the United States.Others said their fallback plan might mean retreating to the underground economy.Joe Luft, the executive director of the Internationals Network for Public Schools, which operates 15 high schools in New York City that specialize in teaching new immigrants, said losing people like Mr. P\u00e9rez could adversely affect the students who had come to confide in him.\u201cI really fear what that does to their sense of hope, which can be tenuous to students anyway,\u201d Mr. Luft said.According to an immigration lawyer, Stephen Yale-Loehr, Mr. Trump could still cancel the program immediately, or let the existing two-year work permits simply expire.Ms. Naveed said it would be \u201ca significant loss\u201d of independence to no longer be able to work and take part in her community openly. Still, she said, \u201cBefore DACA people survived, and after DACA people will survive.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spanish Banks Ordered to Repay Customers Over Unfair Mortgages", "Date": "2016-12-21", "News": "Supported byMADRID \u2014 Europe\u2019s highest court ruled on Wednesday that customers of banks in Spain can reclaim billions of euros because lenders did not pass on savings from interest rate cuts on variable-rate mortgages, sending shares in several of the country\u2019s top lenders crashing.The ruling centered on the use of a \u201cfloor clause\u201d in Spanish mortgage contracts during the aftermath of the global financial crisis. Such agreements meant that the interest rate on an adjustable-rate mortgage was always held above a predetermined level, regardless of how low central bank rates fell.Spain\u2019s lenders began to use the clauses in 2009, after the global financial crisis pushed central banks around the world to slash interest rates. That helped preserve bank profit margins but failed to pass rate cuts on to customers beyond a certain level.In 2013, Spain\u2019s supreme court ruled that such deals were illegal, in part because the country\u2019s banks did not adequately explain them to customers. The court did not, however, penalize lenders retroactively.The European Court of Justice on Wednesday confirmed that the agreements were illegal, but went further by ruling that customers could claim reimbursement, without any time limit, for all payments made at a rate that was judged to be too high.The decision, which cannot be appealed, means Spain\u2019s banks could have to return 4.5 billion euros, or about $4.68 billion, to customers, according to Afi, a Spanish financial consultancy.The ruling, which came as a surprise because it went against the opinion issued earlier this year by the court\u2019s main adviser, sent bank stocks tumbling, with some falling as much as 10 percent.BBVA, one of Spain\u2019s largest banks, said that it expected the ruling would reduce its profits by about \u20ac404 million as a result of further provisions it would have to make. Another bank, Bankia, said its mortgage reimbursement claims could reach as much as \u20ac200 million, though it has already made provisions for about half that amount.Other lenders, like Banco Santander and Bankinter, were not as exposed to the ruling because they either did not use \u201cfloor clauses\u201d or had already made provisions against possible reimbursement costs.\u201cThis ruling really wasn\u2019t expected and comes with full retroactivity, which explains the very negative market reaction,\u201d said Miguel Jim\u00e9nez, a fund manager at Renta 4, a Spanish brokerage and asset management firm. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about banks facing major losses or solvency problems but certainly significant provisioning in some cases.\u201dSpain\u2019s banks were able to make hefty profits in the lead-up to the financial crisis because of a construction boom in the country. But during that time, lenders also set upper and lower limits on mortgage payments.After peaking in 2008 at over 5 percent, the Euribor rate \u2014 an interbank lending rate that is the figure typically used by European banks to determine the financing costs of home loans \u2014 began to fall sharply in 2009.That reduced borrowing costs for customers, but Spain\u2019s banks began to use the \u201cfloor clauses\u201d to continue charging customers more than the market interest rate. Homeowners then started challenging the terms of their mortgage contracts as abusive, eventually taking the issue to the courts.Advertisement"}

Bloomberg wants to make leading colleges more open to the working class. He wants to make them fairer places that look more like America.It has a clear goal: The number of Pell Grant recipients (who tend to come from the bottom two-fifths of the income distribution) attending the 270 colleges with the highest graduation rates should rise 50,000 within 10 years. That would be an increase of more than 10 percent.Porterfield emphasizes the benefits that colleges will get from working together \u2014 like learning how to find students or find budget savings to pay for scholarships. No doubt, this collaboration will help. But I think the public commitment matters more.The truth is that colleges have long had the ability to enroll more middle-class and poor students. They\u2019ve chosen other priorities: sports teams; new buildings; ethnic and geographic diversity; admitting alumni children.Now, to their credit, college leaders have acknowledged that their student bodies are too affluent. Students, professors and the media should hold them to their commitment.Thanks to his PSAT score, he was also invited to receive college counseling through a Bloomberg-financed program. Over FaceTime and Skype, a student at Williams College advised Valdespino on his essays \u2014 the sort of advice affluent students take for granted.Today, Valdespino, whose parents didn\u2019t graduate high school, is a Stanford freshman, finishing first-semester exams and living in the same dorm as the children of a cabinet secretary, a tech company co-founder and other millionaires. \u201cIf there could be more lower-income students here, it would be great,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause we\u2019ve shown we can do just as well as the other students.\u201dDiversifying the country\u2019s Stanfords and Ohio States is obviously only one small step toward addressing alienation. But it matters. The top 270 colleges educate 2.1 million students and produce most of society\u2019s leaders.It may sound surprising to compare a class-based diversity effort, which will benefit many white students, to a racial-diversity push. Yet it makes sense, because diversity, at its best, revolves around fairness.Making top colleges more diverse is not about replacing students of one race with students of another.

Offinger, who was then his campaign finance director, and Josh Gold, a union political operative who worked on the 2014 Senate effort, the people with knowledge of the inquiry said.The federal investigation has examined whether Mr. de Blasio or his aides took beneficial action on behalf of donors in exchange for contributions they had made to his 2013 mayoral campaign, his political nonprofit or both in roughly a half-dozen instances, according to people with knowledge of that inquiry.Because federal and state grand jury proceedings are conducted in secret, few details were available about the witnesses who have appeared so far, the substance of their testimony or the nature of any other evidence that may have been presented to the panels.But the fact that prosecutors have begun presenting evidence to the grand juries suggests the unrelated inquiries are probably moving into their final stages, and could wrap up in a matter of weeks.The identities of the small number of witnesses who have appeared \u2014 some in recent days \u2014 and interviews with people with knowledge of the matter provides some sense of what federal and state prosecutors are focusing on in the grand jury presentations.Mr. de Blasio has been steadfast in maintaining that he and the members of his administration have acted appropriately, something his spokesman, Eric F. Phillips, reiterated late on Thursday, adding, \u201cHe remains focused on running the city.\u201dOn Tuesday, Mr. de Blasio was asked at a news conference on an unrelated matter whether he or any of his \u201cemployees in city government\u201d had been asked to testify before a grand jury.\u201cI have not been asked to testify before a grand jury,\u201d he replied. \u201cI can\u2019t speak to other people.\u201dMr. Phillips also defended Ms. Wolfe, the mayor\u2019s director of intergovernmental affairs.\u201cEmma is an exemplary, honest public servant who has done absolutely nothing wrong,\u201d he said in a statement in response to questions about the state grand jury\u2019s apparent focus on her. \u201cWe look forward to this coming to a conclusion and her being fully cleared.\u201dHarlan Levy, a lawyer who represents Mr. Offinger, said that his client had done \u201cnothing wrong.\u201d\u201cHe was simply doing his job and is a person highly respected for his work as a fund-raiser,\u201d Mr. Levy continued.Mr. Gold\u2019s lawyer, J. Bruce Maffeo, said: \u201cNo reasonable prosecutor would bring a case against Josh Gold on these facts, and if they did, it\u2019s a case they would certainly lose at trial.\u201dThe office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, are conducting the federal inquiry. The office of the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr. is conducting the state inquiry. All three agencies declined to comment.In the federal case, prosecutors have secured the assistance of Mr. Singh, owner of Water\u2019s Edge restaurant in Long Island City, who has been indicted on unrelated federal fraud and bribery charges. Mr. Singh had met with senior officials in City Hall about issues involving his restaurant, and was close to resolving them when he was arrested last year, two people with knowledge of the inquiry said.Mr. Singh, his associates and relatives gave more than $50,000 to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s 2013 campaign and held two fund-raisers at Water\u2019s Edge, which is on city-owned land. The city moved to evict him in early 2015, after an audit concluded that he had underpaid his rent and owed $1.8 million in back rent and fines.He challenged the findings and sued to delay the eviction; at the same time, he sought help from City Hall, working out an arrangement to reduce his arrears and fines. Despite resistance from Ms. Cumberbatch and her aides, the deal was nearly complete when he was arrested on the unrelated charges in September 2015, the people said.The investigation into the Senate push in 2014 is focused on whether the Mr. de Blasio\u2019s fund-raising violated a provision in state election law that bans contributions given to a party committee but designated for a particular candidate to evade individual contribution limits. Such committees can accept donations of up to $102,300, far more than the $11,000 general-election maximum that candidates can receive. The committees are not restricted in how much they can transfer to candidates.Prosecutors in New York State appear never to have used this section of the election law to bring a criminal case, and such a violation would be a felony. Subpoenas issued by prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office early in their investigation sought evidence of a scheme to use the county committees to illegally redistribute contributions to candidates favored by the mayor.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Mexico Businessman Accused of Deceiving Low-Income Home Buyers", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byA New Mexico businessman claimed to help low-income Spanish-speaking families by finding them foreclosed homes to buy and, in some cases, financing the deals.But the state\u2019s attorney general on Wednesday said that Jesus Cano of Albuquerque deceived dozens of consumers by misrepresenting the conditions of the often poorly maintained homes he sold. Sometimes Mr. Cano sold houses he did not even own, the attorney general said, and at other times he tried to sell the same property to more than one family simultaneously.Mr. Cano and his firm, JSS, were sued by the New Mexico attorney general in state court, alleging that his real estate and home financing activities revealed a pattern of \u201cunfair and deceptive trade practices and unconscionable trade practices.\u201dOfficials indicated other parties could be added later to the civil complaint, which seeks restitution and civil penalties.This year, officials began investigating complaints about seller-financed home sales aimed at immigrant and Spanish-speaking communities. New Mexico is one of more than a dozen states where investment firms have bought decrepit homes in the aftermath of the foreclosure crisis and resold them to low-income families through either long-term installment deals called contracts for deed, or rent-to-own transactions.\u201cFamilies everywhere struggling to afford a home need to be aware that real estate contracts do not provide the same protections offered by a mortgage,\u201d Hector H. Balderas, New Mexico\u2019s attorney general, said in a statement.\u201cThey should know that, among other things, a buyer who defaults on a seller-financed real estate contract could face imminent eviction and lose all of the payments made on the property,\u201d he added.Seller-financed deals can provide an alternative to families who want to own a home but cannot get a mortgage because of poor credit or an unwillingness of banks to write loans for under $100,000. But the transactions often lack basic consumer protections and have begun to draw scrutiny from the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and state regulators.State officials said in their complaint that Mr. Cano and his firm initially used a sparse contract written entirely in Spanish but later switched to a longer English contract that provided him with more legal protections. In some cases, the English contracts also outlined one important piece of information: Mr. Cano and his firm did not always own the property at the time the document was signed.In an interview, Mr. Cano said he disputed the allegations, and said some of his business practices had been mischaracterized. He said he had yet to see the suit.He also required customers to make a \u201cgood faith deposit,\u201d from $1,500 to $46,000, for homes that New Mexico officials said were often \u201csubstandard\u201d and had \u201cdefective plumbing\u201d and \u201cdefective electrical wiring,\u201d according to the lawsuit. Often, customers lost their deposits because Mr. Cano refused to refund the money, the authorities said.\u201cI buy homes and sell them,\u201d Mr. Cano said. \u201cThe customers look at the homes, and they know exactly the conditions of the homes before they buy them.\u201dMr. Cano\u2019s deals required his customer to either buy the homes outright or enter into a financing agreement with his firm. The company tended to charge 12 percent interest on loans that were paid in monthly installments, according to a Spanish-language version of the contract.Officials also said Mr. Cano was backed by a group of investors and corporations, who were unidentified.He marketed his services by posting fliers on businesses primarily serving Spanish-speaking people and in churches mainly attended by Spanish-speaking congregants, according to officials in New Mexico. He also used his Hispanic heritage to ingratiate himself with potential customers, officials added.\u201cNo one in this country deserves to have their dreams for a better life for their family exploited and destroyed,\u201d Mr. Balderas said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Guggenheim Helsinki Museum Plans Are Rejected", "Date": "2016-11-30", "News": "Supported byPlans to build a Guggenheim museum in Helsinki were defeated on Wednesday night, when lawmakers in the Finnish city voted down a proposal to pay for the $138 million museum with a mixture of private and public money.After more than five hours of debate, the 85-member City Council rejected the controversial plan, 53 to 32, meaning that the project to construct an art museum on the banks of the South Harbor of Helsinki will be abandoned, at least for now.\u201cThe main objections to the project presented by Council members included the project\u2019s excessive cost for the Finnish taxpayer; inadequate private funding; and the proposed site, which was considered too valuable for the project,\u201d the Helsinki Council communications department said in a statement issued after the vote.The Helsinki museum would have been the fourth satellite museum of the New York Guggenheim in the world, with other locations in Venice; Bilbao, Spain; and another planned for Abu Dhabi.Richard Armstrong, director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and Foundation in New York, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday that he had believed the museum could substantially raise the cultural profile of Helsinki and that, as in Bilbao, it would lift attendance at other cultural institutions.After the vote, Mr. Armstrong said he was disappointed.\u201cI suppose that it was a reaction to a sense of engulfing internationalism, or a reaction against globalism,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how I\u2019m explaining it to myself.\u201dMr. Armstrong said that he was surprised by the depth of the resistance and that he and the Guggenheim would now speak to the Finnish supporters of the project to see if there was any interest in pursuing it further.\u201cBut I think it\u2019s unlikely that there would be any further activity,\u201d he said.The Guggenheim Helsinki project has been the subject of intense scrutiny since plans were unveiled in 2011. Opposition has come from both the populist far right and members of the left and Social Democrats, for different reasons. All seemed to agree that public funding should not be spent on a private institution, especially when the government is enforcing austerity measures to help the economy rebound from an economic downturn.Also voiced was a sense that the proposed museum represented an outside cultural influence, not a homegrown product of Finnish cultural sensibilities.\u201cI\u2019m exhausted but relieved,\u201d said Osku Pajamaki, a City Council member who was a leading opponent of the Guggenheim proposal. \u201cInstead of buying a subsidiary of the Guggenheim Museum in New York, we can now focus on creating unique local cultural attractions in Helsinki.\u201dSupport for the project had come from conservative and center parties, with significant interest from Finnish business groups, said Ari Lahti, an investment banker and chairman of the Guggenheim Helsinki Supporting Foundation.The foundation had raised $36 million from private and corporate donors for the plan, Mr. Lahti said. Of that total, $16 million was to have gone toward building the museum and $20 million to pay the license fee to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in New York for use of the Guggenheim name and \u201caccess to the Guggenheim\u2019s knowledge and expertise, collections, international network of museums and communications channels,\u201d according to the New York museum.\u201cWe have received donations, with no strings attached, from the hotels in Finland; restaurants in Helsinki; Finnair, the national airline company; the three big ferry companies that operate in Helsinki,\u201d Mr. Lahti said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting support from people who see this as a good investment for Finland economically and from people who love art. All the big museum leaders are in favor of the museum.\u201dThe museum was to have been built according to a design by the Paris-based architectural firm Moreau Kusunoki, which had won an international design competition. Its horizontal campus of ascending linked pavilions, said Nicolas Moreau, a partner in the firm, \u201cis based on a design concept of openness, flexibility,\u201d allowing curators to configure exhibition space in a variety of ways.Along with exhibitions of artworks on loan from the Guggenheim Museum in New York, the museum was to have included work by local artists.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Treasury May Mean Independence for Fannie and Freddie", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byFair GameSteven Mnuchin, President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s nominee to run the Treasury Department, electrified Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac shareholders on Wednesday when he signaled that the mortgage finance giants would finally be allowed to get out from under Washington\u2019s thumb.\u201cWe got to get Fannie and Freddie out of government ownership,\u201d he told Fox Business. \u201cIt makes no sense that these are owned by the government and have been controlled by the government for as long as they have.\u201dMr. Mnuchin is right. It has been more than eight years since the federal government took over Fannie and Freddie in the mortgage crisis; as such, they are the last big piece of unfinished business from that era.When the government changed the terms of their bailouts in the summer of 2012 and began expropriating all of Fannie\u2019s and Freddie\u2019s profits every quarter, it seemed as if that unsatisfactory setup would go on forever. After all, it is hard for the government to give up a honey pot that has returned over $60 billion more to the Treasury than the companies received from taxpayers during their troubles.Granted, Mr. Mnuchin said little about how the administration thinks the nation\u2019s biggest \u201cgovernment-sponsored enterprises\u201d should be structured. That is not surprising, given the complexity of the $6 trillion mortgage market.So why did Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s comments jazz the markets? Because they revealed a seismic shift in the way these companies are viewed by the new administration. In place of the strident, anti-G.S.E. ideology that has dominated the conversation on both the left and the right since the bailout, it looks as if a more pragmatic and positive approach to the companies and their role in the mortgage market is on the way.What that means, in my view, is that the enterprises may be allowed to live a new day rather than continue to be diminished and drained of their profits.This is good news indeed for small lenders who rely so heavily on Fannie and Freddie to buy the mortgages they underwrite, freeing them to repeat the process rather than hold the loans on their balance sheets. And when small lenders benefit, borrowers do, too, by having more choices.\u201cSince 2012, we\u2019ve been advocating for the G.S.E.s to be reformed, recapitalized and then released from conservatorship,\u201d Mr. Corso said. \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that is the direction the Trump administration will head in.\u201dAlthough there was not much talk of Fannie and Freddie on the campaign trail, it was widely assumed that a Clinton administration would embrace some of those Obama housing officials as well as their ideas.That those officials now have little sway is one reason shares in Fannie and Freddie soared in value just after the election and even before Mr. Mnuchin spoke about the companies.As a former head of the mortgage-backed securities desk at Goldman Sachs, Mr. Mnuchin well understands the mechanics of this enormous market. He also recognizes the significant role a well-capitalized Fannie and Freddie could play in ensuring that borrowers have access to mortgage money in good economies as well as bad.So what might happen now? In his comments, Mr. Mnuchin nodded to a crucial issue regarding Fannie and Freddie: safety and soundness. \u201cWe\u2019ll make sure that when they\u2019re restructured, they\u2019re absolutely safe and they don\u2019t get taken over again,\u201d he said, \u201cBut we got to get them out of government control.\u201dThis is clearly untenable and unsafe for taxpayers, who would again be on the hook if Fannie and Freddie began losing money.An easy way to let them rebuild capital would be to end the quarterly transfer of all their profits to the Treasury. This would not require legislation; it could be done administratively with incoming Treasury officials advising the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates Fannie and Freddie, to change the terms of the government\u2019s agreement with the companies. This was supposed to happen anyway while the companies were operating under the conservatorship.What of the fears that if they are allowed to recapitalize, the companies will return to their swaggering, prebailout ways and grow powerful and reckless as they did in the 1990s?Mr. Corso and others say safeguards are in place to protect taxpayers from such an outcome.\u201cWe would be the first to acknowledge that there were serious deficiencies in the way the G.S.E.s operated, pre-2008,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a lot have been addressed in the conservatorship.\u201dSimply recapitalizing the companies will also be cleaner, preventing potential self-dealing and the giveaways of the companies\u2019 assets that existed in some of the privatization proposals.There is another intriguing aspect to the Trump administration\u2019s shift, and it has to do with the lawsuits that have been filed against the government. One such suit was brought by Fairholme Funds, a mutual fund company that owns Fannie and Freddie shares. It contends that the 2012 profit sweep was an improper taking of private property without just compensation.Margaret Sweeney, the judge hearing the matter in the Court of Federal Claims, recently opened the door a crack, letting some documents see the light of day. Some of the materials cast doubt on arguments made by the government\u2019s lawyers that the profit sweep came about because Fannie and Freddie were in dire condition and the taxpayers needed protection from future losses.If Judge Sweeney were to order the release of more documents, the current administration would probably appeal. It is not as clear that a Trump administration would do so, however. This opens the possibility that all those materials that the Obama administration has fought so hard to keep secret might just emerge.That would be a huge service for anyone interested in holding government officials accountable for their actions.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Panama Struggles to Shed Its Image as a Magnet for Shady Deals", "Date": "2016-12-03", "News": "Supported byIn August of last year, Panama sought to shed its image as a magnet for shady deals and narco traffickers by paying at least $2 million to host the world\u2019s largest anticorruption conference, now taking place in Panama City.At the time, it seemed like good idea.After the leak, involving millions of legal documents, the president, Juan Carlos Varela, appointed a seven-member commission in April to recommend how to make its financial sector more transparent. That did not work out exactly as planned, either.For credibility, the president had included Joseph E. Stiglitz, the Nobel laureate economist and a fierce critic of tax havens \u2014 onshore and offshore \u2014 which he views as the dark side of globalization. What happened next should surprise no one familiar with Panamanian politics or the resolve of Mr. Stiglitz.The commission, if not dead on arrival, quickly ended up on life support. Mr. Stiglitz and another board member, Mark Pieth, a Swiss anticorruption expert, resigned after only one official meeting because the government, they said, would not promise to make their final report public.\u201cYou can\u2019t have a committee on transparency and not be transparent,\u201d Mr. Stiglitz said.The repercussions of this contretemps continued in the months leading up to the anticorruption conference. Each faction issued its own report. A prominent Panamanian lawyer publicly chastised professors at Columbia University, where Mr. Stiglitz teaches, for using the words \u201cPanama Papers\u201d in a course title, saying it unfairly singled out his country. And at the university\u2019s World Leaders Forum in September, Mr. Stiglitz gently confronted Panama\u2019s vice president for rendering what he said was an inaccurate account of why the commission had broken apart.With the world\u2019s economic powers intensifying their attack on tax havens, the commission\u2019s failure to speak in one voice illustrates the difficulty of trying to reform a financial system, particularly in a small country where familial ties run deep and the financial interests of elite lawyers and bankers are embedded in offshore businesses.Panama has taken some steps toward transparency. After initially balking, Panama did agree this year to a multilateral deal to provide the names of the real owners of offshore companies when other countries request them. And President Varela spoke at the opening ceremony of the anticorruption conference.But more needs to be done, said Mr. Stiglitz, a former co-chairman of the committee. He and Mr. Pieth said they were not bitter, but rued Panama\u2019s lost opportunity to serve as a model for other nations \u2014 including the United States \u2014 that do not fully comply with international standards of transparency.Other commission members blamed internal conflicts, not the government, for resignations. \u201cAll institutions have been open and willing to share information, documents and even opinions,\u201d Roberto Artavia Loria, a commission member, wrote in an email to Mr. StiglitzEven so, an examination by The New York Times of the business connections of the four Panamanian commission members \u2014 the fifth was Costa Rican \u2014 points to the challenges that Mr. Stiglitz and Mr. Pieth had to overcome.One member, Nicol\u00e1s Ardito Barletta, a former president of Panama under a dictatorship, helped to create the country\u2019s offshore industry in the 1970s as minister of planning. Mr. Barletta also championed the country\u2019s free-trade zone, a prime target of Mr. Stiglitz, who views lightly regulated, tax-advantaged zones as an invitation to money laundering.A second member, Gisela Porras, was once a partner in a law firm that recently advertised: \u201cOur corporate law is attractive for many reasons. First of all, shareholder information is not filed at the Public Registry, therefore granting confidentiality to beneficial owners.\u201dThe commission\u2019s other co-chairman, Alberto Alem\u00e1n, is an independent director of Global Bank, one of three Panamanian banks whose outlook was recently revised by S & P Global to negative from stable, reflecting \u201cshortfalls in regulation, supervision, governance and transparency in the Panamanian financial system.\u201dAfter a Spanish-led consortium won the right to build locks for bigger ships at a rock-bottom price, internal arguments soon gave way to larger problems.President Varela is also closely tied to law firms that handle offshore accounts. One Alem\u00e1n cousin is now his chief of staff, and both his vice minister of foreign affairs and the minister of economy and finance came from the Morgan & Morgan Group, which includes a law firm known for its offshore business. And one of the president\u2019s closest advisers until early this year was Ramon Fonseca Mora, a partner in Mossack Fonseca, the law firm that generated the Panama Papers. The German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung obtained the data and later shared it with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, a nonprofit group based in Washington.Mr. Stiglitz initially wondered whether the government was serious about his appointment, but he said two things had convinced him that it was. Panama\u2019s vice president, Isabel de Saint Malo, flew to New York to personally ask Mr. Stiglitz to join, and Mr. Pieth was also asked to serve.The group met officially for the first time in June in New York. The honeymoon did not last long.\u201cEveryone was guilty of bad Googling,\u201d said one person who knew the commission members. Mr. Pieth added, \u201cWe didn\u2019t spend an awful amount of time on due diligence on our colleagues.\u201dPotential conflicts quickly became apparent, according to notes taken by an attendee. One member expressed concern about damage control, since the expanded canal was about to open \u2014 a moment of great national pride \u2014 and, the member said, \u201cwe will use that moment to say this is who we are and where our future is headed.\u201d When the subject of a public registry of beneficial owners was raised, Mr. Stiglitz said, \u201cyou could see them blanch.\u201d And, he added, there was no serious discussion about closer monitoring of tax-advantaged, free-trade zones, or the strong enforcement of the open-records law.The group agreed that it should secure a promise from President Varela that its final report would be made public. \u201cThey said they would go to the government and get it, and they never did,\u201d Mr. Stiglitz said.Instead, on July 29, the group received a stern note from the government, saying that the presidential decree establishing the commission stipulated that the report \u201cwill be the property of and used by the Republic of Panama\u201d and that it would decide what to share with the public. The government also said funds requested for operational expenses would not be coming.Compounding matters, Mr. Stiglitz and Mr. Pieth said they had been shocked to learn, other members had surreptitiously sent an \u201cinterim\u201d report to President Varela without their knowledge or approval. That report, Mr. Stiglitz said, was too narrow and poorly written.Mr. Pieth wrote his own stinging response. \u201cI cannot help feeling that the president asked you to participate in the committee exactly for what you have done: to pull the emergency brakes when matters seemed to get tight for the Panamanian services industry.\u201dAround that time, Mr. Alem\u00e1n, the co-chairman, visited Mr. Stiglitz in New York to tell him that the commission should disband.The rump commission recently filed a final report, which Mr. Stiglitz said was not substantively different from the interim report. \u201cThey\u2019re making a valiant effort to sound tough,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the key weaknesses in the transparency framework have not been addressed.\u201d He emphasized the importance of making all the names of beneficial owners public. \u201cWe are very big on the notion of a searchable registry, and they are very opposed to that,\u201d he said.Recent corruption investigations underscore their concern.This year, United States officials publicly identified Nidal Waked and Abdul Waked and their associates as running a major money-laundering ring that allegedly helped drug traffickers hide illicit profits in dozens of shell companies and a Panamanian bank. Both men, who dispute the allegations, have long had a power base in the Col\u00f3n Free Trade Zone, which is next to the Panama Canal.In a statement, the United States Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control said that by publicly identifying this ring and freezing the ring\u2019s assets under United States control, it had disrupted the group\u2019s ability \u201cto launder drug-trafficking proceeds using trade-based methods, duty-free retail, real estate development and financial services throughout the region.\u201dIn an unrelated investigation that has rocked Brazil\u2019s political establishment, prosecutors there said they had the Panama Papers law firm, Mossack Fonseca, in their sights. \u201cIt is clear to us that there were at least two crimes committed by Mossack Fonseca\u2019s office in Brazil \u2014 financial crime and organized crime,\u201d said Jerusa Burmann Viecili, a Brazilian federal prosecutor.She added: \u201cMossack Fonseca\u2019s registering of offshores had an objective that was quite clear \u2014 to hide the truthful beneficiaries of these shell companies.\u201dMossack Fonseca said its Brazil affiliate, or franchise, operated independently of the main office.Brazil\u2019s investigation, called Operation Lava Jato, or Operation Car Wash, has also alleged that workers of the Brazilian construction company Odebrecht, one of the largest in Latin America \u2014 and one of Panama\u2019s public-works contractors \u2014 used shell companies to cover its tracks in a bribe-paying scheme.Panamanian banks are alleged to have held some of the bribe money. Multibank, formerly known as Multi-Credit Bank, is cited in court documents as one of the places where funds were deposited. This financial institution\u2019s outlook was recently revised downward by S & P Global.An article on Dec. 4 about anti-corruption efforts in Panama referred incorrectly to leaked documents known as the \u201cPanama Papers.\u201d They were obtained by the German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, not the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.Vinod Sreeharsha contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hospitals in Safety Net Brace for Health Care Law\u2019s Repeal", "Date": "2016-12-28", "News": "Supported byPHILADELPHIA \u2014 Jason Colston Sr. went to the emergency room at Temple University Hospital last month with his calf swollen to twice its normal size. A bacterial infection had entered his bloodstream, requiring him to spend nine days at Temple, where patients are overwhelmingly poor.Mr. Colston, 36, had no insurance through his job at a 7-Eleven, but it turned out he was eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Temple helped him enroll as soon as he was admitted, and Medicaid paid for his stay and continuing treatment.Before the health law, the hospital had to absorb the cost of caring for many uninsured patients like Mr. Colston. Now, with President-elect Donald J. Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress vowing to dismantle the law, Temple and other hospitals serving the poor are bracing for harsh financial consequences that could have a serious effect on the care they provide.Since the election, hospitals have been among the loudest voices against wholesale repeal of the health law. In a letter to Mr. Trump and congressional leaders this month, the two biggest hospital trade groups warned of \u201can unprecedented public health crisis\u201d and said hospitals stood to lose $165 billion through 2026 if more than 20 million people lose the insurance they gained under the law. They predicted widespread layoffs, cuts in outpatient care and services for the mentally ill, and even hospital closings.Here in Pennsylvania, where the health law has brightened the financial outlook of hospitals statewide, many are scrambling to assess how repeal would affect their bottom line and the patients they serve. The stakes are particularly high for safety-net hospitals like Temple, but even more prosperous hospitals face uncertainty after investing in new ways to deliver care under the law.Temple executives estimate their system could lose as much as $45 million a year if the law were entirely repealed, which would return it to the losses it posted for years before the health law took effect.\u201cWe are the de facto community hospital in one of the poorest neighborhoods in the country,\u201d said Robert Lux, the senior vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer of Temple University Health System, which includes two general hospitals and a cancer center. \u201cAny kind of change like this would not only push Temple University Hospital into financial extremis, it would do the same thing for our entire system.\u201dNot far from Temple, Main Line Health, a nonprofit hospital system in the affluent Philadelphia suburbs, is far better positioned to weather the financial impact of repeal. While Temple has one of the poorest patient populations in the state \u2014 about half of its patients are on Medicaid \u2014 Main Line, which has an outpatient clinic in an upscale mall and another with a fitness center outfitted with filtered saltwater pools, has few Medicaid patients.Still, even hospitals serving affluent populations have reason to be nervous about a future without the health law. Main Line has invested substantially in response to the law\u2019s push to base hospital pay on patient outcomes instead of the amount of medical services provided. Repealing the law would create uncertainty about the future of this new paradigm, which has forced hospitals to rethink how they deliver care.\u201cI\u2019m dreading the unpredictability,\u201d said John J. Lynch III, Main Line\u2019s president and chief executive.Over all, the health law has improved the financial outlook of Pennsylvania hospitals significantly, even though the state was a year late in expanding Medicaid. The former governor, Tom Corbett, a Republican, initially balked, and the program did not expand here until 2015. Still, hospital operating margins statewide increased to about 5.5 percent on average in 2015, from 4.25 percent in 2014, according to the Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania. The amount of care provided to patients who cannot pay dropped by 8.6 percent on average.North Philadelphia, where Temple is based, is among the poorest neighborhoods in the nation. Many of its residents live in deep poverty, a census designation that means their income is less than half the federal poverty level of $24,300 for a family of four. That helps explain why Temple is so dependent on Medicaid revenue, and the high stakes of repeal here.Under the health law, hospitals that served a large number of poor and uninsured patients agreed to a series of funding cuts in exchange for getting far more patients with insurance coverage. Temple has lost about $11 million so far in these federal funds, known as disproportionate share payments, Mr. Lux said.But like other hospitals in the 31 states that expanded Medicaid under the law, it has made up that revenue in part through the Medicaid expansion. It recorded about 13,000 more visits from patients with Medicaid coverage in 2015, the first year Pennsylvania expanded Medicaid eligibility, and at least as many this year. Still, Temple is barely turning a profit: It had operating income of $3.6 million in the fiscal year that ended June 30, despite revenue of $1.7 billion.\u201cYou still have a pretty fragile enterprise,\u201d Mr. Lux said, noting that Medicaid pays hospitals and doctors far less than Medicare and private insurance. \u201cOur current state of stability could be broken pretty quickly.\u201dSo, too, could Temple\u2019s efforts to connect its newly insured patients with preventive care instead of waiting until they show up in the emergency room with advanced, expensive illnesses. Dr. Robert McNamara, chairman of emergency medicine at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, said he had seen more than a few uninsured people arrive in the emergency room with kidney failure, needing costly dialysis for the rest of their lives because they had lived with high blood pressure for so long.Main Line Health\u2019s financial picture is much stronger, and will most likely remain so even if the health law is repealed and replaced with a program that leaves far fewer people insured. Main Line ended the 2016 fiscal year with $106.8 million in operating income and a 6.5 percent operating margin, compared with Temple\u2019s margin of 0.2 percent.Still, Main Line has invested substantially in efforts to improve the care it provides its patients while lowering the cost, as the Affordable Care Act encourages. As with many hospitals across the country, these efforts \u2014 like preventing readmissions and focusing more heavily on primary care, especially for patients with chronic diseases \u2014 have caused the system\u2019s inpatient population to drop.\u201cAs we decrease our volume, looking at providing care differently, that\u2019s financially impacting us,\u201d Mr. Lynch said.He added that over time, the law\u2019s slowing of Medicare payment increases added up to \u201creal money.\u201d The study commissioned by the hospital associations found that unless the annual increase in Medicare reimbursements is restored to what it was before the health law passed, hospitals will face additional losses of about $290 billion by 2026.In the end, though, Main Line\u2019s far more robust revenue, because of its large number of commercially insured patients, all but guarantee it will not have to worry \u2014 for now \u2014 about cutting programs or plans. It is installing a new electronic records system and has spent $700 million renovating its hospitals over the last few years.\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a strong payer mix or a healthy bottom line,\u201d Mr. Lynch said, \u201cit\u2019s very difficult to do those things.\u201dOne major question for Temple and other safety-net hospitals is whether states would restore supplemental funds or programs that defrayed the cost of caring for the uninsured before the health law took effect. Pennsylvania, for example, paid for emergency medical care for certain low-income people who did not qualify for Medicaid. This allowed Temple to be paid for their inpatient care, but often not for the care they needed after being discharged.\u201cWe don\u2019t know that that program would come back,\u201d Mr. Lux said, adding that the program used to pay for about $23 million a year worth of care provided at Temple University Hospital.Mr. Colston, who was still returning daily to Temple for intravenous antibiotics a month after his discharge, would have qualified to have most of his inpatient costs met under the old state-financed program. Paul Fabian, who received a double lung transplant at Temple last year after getting a subsidized private insurance policy from the Affordable Care Act marketplace, would not have qualified at all. Mr. Fabian, who suffered from emphysema and chronic lung failure, said he sold his truck to afford his $262 monthly premiums.\u201cIf you walk into the E.R. they have to help you,\u201d Mr. Fabian, 61, said. \u201cBut if you have a condition like I had, what\u2019s the hospital\u2019s obligation?\u201dTemple officials said that without insurance, Mr. Fabian would have had to endure a two-year waiting period to qualify for Medicare coverage for his disability.\u201cWe were finally in a situation where for most of our patients there was a coverage option,\u201d said Anita Colon, Temple\u2019s director of patient financial services, already speaking about the health law in the past tense. \u201cNow there\u2019s just a total unknown about what will be left.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Inquiry Alludes to Russia and Syria as Bombers of Aid Convoy", "Date": "2016-12-21", "News": "Supported byThe panel stopped short of identifying which countries did it, but said pointedly that American-led forces were \u201chighly unlikely\u201d to have been responsible for the deadly attack, which left only Syrian and Russian forces capable of carrying it out.The findings came as diplomats, in a highly unusual effort, voted decisively in the General Assembly for a resolution to empower the United Nations to prepare war crimes cases in Syria for prosecution in a future court.The United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, appointed the board of inquiry to look into the Sept. 19 attack in a rebel-held town called Urum al-Kubra. At the time, Mr. Ban described it as \u201csickening, savage and apparently deliberate.\u201dBut the board, headed by an Indian Army general, Abhijit Guha, was constrained in its investigation. The government of Syria only recently allowed board members into the country, and only for five days. It did not allow them to visit the site of the attack, citing security, the board members reported. So the conclusions in a seven-page summary of the report were vague about attribution.The summary said that aircraft operating as part of the American-led coalition in Syria, as well as Syrian and Russian militaries, \u201call had the capabilities\u201d for such an attack, and that armed opposition groups did not. The panel further noted that none of the combatants had alleged that the American-led coalition\u2019s planes had carried out the attack, so their \u201cinvolvement was highly unlikely.\u201dThe panel also cautioned that it had no evidence to conclude that the assault was \u201ca deliberate attack on a humanitarian target.\u201dThe convoy of 31 trucks had come from government-held territory after weeks of careful negotiations for government permission. The convoy was marked conspicuously with the logos of the United Nations and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent.The board submitted its report to Mr. Ban last Friday. His aides released a summary late Wednesday.The new \u201cmechanism\u201d could be housed in the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, diplomats said, and would be financed by voluntary contributions.Its mandate would be to \u201ccollect, consolidate, preserve and analyze evidence of such crimes and prepare files in order to facilitate and expedite fair and independent criminal proceedings in national, regional or international courts or tribunals that have or may in the future have jurisdiction over these crimes.\u201dThe United Nations approved the resolution as the evacuation of the last vestiges of rebels and civilians from insurgent-held areas of Aleppo was nearing completion. The process had been repeatedly disrupted for days and was further hampered Wednesday by a snowstorm.Rick Gladstone contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Russians, Bleak Realities at Home", "Date": "2016-12-27", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 Russian hackers have been making front pages recently in the United States and Europe, but few people in Russia seem to care or even notice. The Russia of international media and the Russia that we, Russians, know from the inside could not be further apart.Abroad, President Vladimir V. Putin is seen to be upsetting the post-Cold War balance of power in Europe, pushing the United States out of the Middle East and instigating a nationalist-demagogic resurgence across the Western world. Having just helped install an American president of his choosing, he has even more king-making opportunities awaiting him in 2017, in elections set for the Netherlands, France and Germany.This, at least, is what one gleans about Mr. Putin\u2019s abilities from the Western press. But little about these feats, whether they are exaggerated or not, resounds domestically. When reported in Russia, they come across as part of the general white noise that Moscow\u2019s state-run media create every day.Most news on Russia\u2019s heavily controlled television, the media of choice for most Russians, is international, not domestic. But when the Vladimir Putin of the reports from Aleppo or Tokyo is offered to the audience, Russians see him as some distant international entity whose actions have little to do with anything happening in their own lives.Back here, it is outright scary. The latest horror is a mass poisoning in the Siberian city Irkutsk. This month 71 people were reported dead after drinking hawthorn berry tincture made with alcohol. The liquid, sold as scented bath soap, was marked \u201cnot for ingestion,\u201d but people bought it for that purpose because it was cheap \u2014 70 rubles ($1) a bottle. One shipment proved deadly because the alcohol in it was methanol, not the customary ethanol.Similar liquids are sold and commonly used as booze by destitute alcoholics throughout recession-ridden Russia, where even people with average incomes hoard cash and switch to cheaper goods during hard times. The cheapest legitimate vodka commands the controlled price of 190 rubles, or $3, in grocery stores; the alcoholics at the bottom of the income chain cannot afford even counterfeit vodka, which sells at about 100 rubles ($1.60) a bottle. The Russian Research Center of Federal and Regional Markets for Alcohol estimates that about 10 to 12 million people fit that description.News of this sort could take up much more television time, and spark more public conversation, if it were not already being spent on the war in Syria, the refugee crisis in Europe or primaries in France. Those events are what feature prominently in the media diet fed to every Russian. If the domestic agenda really were the center of public attention, people would have to face the reality not just of pauper drunkards, but also of children dying in a foster home because of a lack of funding. In that newsworthy event last August, also from Irkutsk, a state-run foster home had too little money to provide adequate treatment for its young charges, three of whom died during a dysentery epidemic.Incomes are declining, and poverty is on the rise. The economic slump that started in 2014 hit those least protected. Since 2013, the number of people living below the official poverty line has grown from 15.5 million to 21.4 million this year \u2014 14.6 percent of the population. The official threshold of poverty currently stands at 9,889 rubles a month ($160). If a European formula for poverty measurement (60 percent of median income) were used, the figure would be much higher.This is the unseemly flip side of the agile and unpredictable power that the world sees on television screens. It would be tempting to think that Russia\u2019s newly assertive and costly foreign policy was a direct reason for the failing economy and deteriorating quality of life. In fact, the cause-and-effect sequence may be the other way around. The annexation of Crimea and Moscow\u2019s later aggressive moves were not just responses to one particular event, a Western-instigated revolution in Ukraine. They were natural consequences of the Kremlin\u2019s decision to put Russia on the kind of path it is on now.Behind Russia\u2019s recession, which is slowly morphing into stagnation, are the weakened price of oil in recent years and some longer-term factors, like the state\u2019s growing role in economic matters and an unwelcoming business climate. The decline started long before Moscow went into Ukraine or Syria. The systemic nature of the current crisis is underscored by the fact that even with the oil price hovering at $50 a barrel, the Russian Finance Ministry does not project the country\u2019s economy growing faster than 1.5 percent annually, all the way to 2030.This is a man-made situation, not destiny. Central control of what Mr. Putin calls strategic economic assets and a heavily controlled social order have been his priorities since he took power in 2000. He dismantled the fledging competitive political scene Russia had in the late 1980s and the 1990s, got rid of most independent institutions and renationalized the economy. The share of state-owned and state-controlled companies contributing to gross national product increased from 35 percent in the early 2000s to 70 percent now. The number of state and municipal unitary enterprises tripled just from 2013 to 2015. \u201cRussia now has the kind of state monopoly capitalism that troubled Vladimir Lenin so much more than a century ago,\u201d Boris Grozovsky, a prominent writer about the Russian economy, concluded recently in an article for The Russia File.The economic basis for agility in Russia\u2019s current foreign policy is not much stronger these days than it was 100 years ago, before the Russian Revolution, and the concentration of wealth in a closed circle of the privileged few is similar. Nevertheless, morale is higher. The difference, of course, is that this time the modern czar has made himself popular. Nicholas II, the last czar of Russia, was never truly loved, and during the late days of his empire he became a forlorn and sad figure. His people and his inner circle abandoned him, leading even convinced monarchists to support his abdication in the face of revolution in 1917.Every Russian ruler is haunted by that vision. Mr. Putin\u2019s project all along has been to stave off anything remotely resembling the popular uprisings or betrayals by the elites in Russia\u2019s past. To reach this goal he has consolidated the power of the state in politics and the economy. But attaining the kind of security for his regime that he considers foolproof meant losing on the economic front.The result: Now a deep sense of insecurity among the public has continued to spread, rather than abate. And a realization that Russia \u2014 with its renationalized economy and aging population \u2014 is now incapable of competing on equal economic and political terms with other major powers may have led the Kremlin to believe that it can compete only by other means \u2014 namely by displaying no hesitation at using force or covert influence to claim Russian greatness again.Maxim Trudolyubov, editor at large at the business newspaper Vedomosti, writes The Russia File blog for the Kennan Institute and is a fellow at the Bosch Academy in Berlin.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Small Banks Also Charge Substantial Overdraft Fees, Report Says", "Date": "2016-12-20", "News": "Supported byYour Money AdviserSmall banks are not much better than big banks when it comes to the fees they charge customers who spend more than they have in their accounts.The findings are not surprising, said Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center. \u201cSome smaller banks are far more addicted to overdraft fees than bigger banks,\u201d she said.This year, Pew also studied a group of smaller banks, which offered a snapshot of bank practices. While the sample did not represent a cross section of small banks across the country, Pew said, the findings highlight \u201ccommon\u201d practices at many banks.The study found that the typical overdraft fee at a small bank was $32, which is not much lower than the $35 charged by big banks. All 45 of the smaller banks allow customers to run up fees of at least $90 each day, and many permit accumulation of much higher daily totals, the analysis found.On the plus side, the smaller banks were less likely to reorder a customer\u2019s debits in order of the largest amount to the smallest \u2014 a practice that tends to increase the number of overdraft fees the bank can charge. Just two of the banks said in their disclosures that they reorder account transactions from high to low.Historically, said Joy Hackenbracht, a research officer with the consumer banking project, overdraft coverage was considered a \u201ccourtesy\u201d extended to customers occasionally, such as when a customer bounced a check. But as debit card and A.T.M. transactions became the norm, overdraft fees became more common. For some customers overdrafts function more like very expensive, short-term loans.\u201cThe existing protections are not working,\u201d Ms. Hackenbracht said. \u201cThere is a better way to do this.\u201dPew is proposing that federal regulators allow banks to charge no more than six overdraft fees a year; ban them from reordering transactions to maximize fees; and provide account holders with clear terms and pricing information.Pew also recommends that regulators enable banks to offer affordable, small-dollar loans, in place of overdraft fees, to help vulnerable customers when they need credit.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been studying overdraft fees for several years. The agency continues to research such fees and is testing different types of bank disclosures that might help consumers better understand their overdraft options.Here are some questions and answers about overdraft fees.How can I avoid overdraft fees?The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau advises that consumers not use the overdraft coverage offered by banks for debit-card purchases and A.T.M. withdrawals. By law, customers must \u201copt in\u201d to get such coverage. Be aware that without it, your bank will decline transactions that overdraw your account, instead of allowing them and then charging you a substantial fee.Virginia O\u2019Neill, senior vice president of the American Bankers Association\u2019s Center for Regulatory Compliance, emphasized that customers who want debit card and A.T.M. overdraft protection \u201cmust opt in and can opt out at any time.\u201dMs. O\u2019Neill also recommended that consumers take advantage of tools that banks offer to help customers manage their accounts, like text or email alerts that notify customers if their balance drops below a certain level.What if I am charged a penalty, but I don\u2019t want overdraft coverage?Pew\u2019s previous research has found that many consumers who pay overdraft fees do not recall choosing the coverage \u2014 perhaps because the language used by banks to promote the service can be confusing. You may want to call your bank to confirm that you are not mistakenly signed up for the coverage, Ms. Saunders said, and turn it off if you don\u2019t want it.What if I\u2019m really worried about running up overdraft fees?You may want to consider using prepaid debit cards, which typically do not allow overdrafts, or so-called safe checking accounts that do not offer overdraft protection at all, Ms. Saunders said.The downside is that prepaid cards and \u201csafe\u201d accounts generally do not offer paper checks, and are more likely to charge monthly maintenance fees, so consumers should read the account agreement carefully. But it may be less costly over all, Ms. Saunders said, to pay a regular, relatively low fee each month than to potentially pay much more in overdraft fees for overspending your account.\u201cAn honest monthly fee is worth it,\u201d she said, \u201cto be able to manage your budget.\u201dEmail: yourmoneyadviser@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Many Missed Deadlines, New Jersey Megamall Is Again Taking Shape", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byOver the last 13 years, opening dates for a huge shopping and entertainment complex in the Meadowlands have flashed by like exits on the New Jersey Turnpike, which runs past the site of the long-delayed project in East Rutherford, N.J.\u201cWhat we\u2019re creating here is out of this world,\u201d Don Ghermezian, whose family controls Triple Five Group, said during an interview at the company\u2019s stark white offices overlooking the construction site. \u201cIt\u2019s the best of retail and entertainment combined in one environment. There isn\u2019t a project in the world that has developed this large a concentration of entertainment-retail, not in China, not in Dubai.\u201dThe mall, however, is planned for a bleak swath of New Jersey, eight miles west of Manhattan, at a time when space sits empty at hundreds of shopping centers in the United States and internet sales are skyrocketing.Mr. Ghermezian said his company had leased 70 percent of the 2.9 million square feet available at American Dream. The company, which has already poured $700 million into the project, is now spending roughly $1 million a day on construction.Triple Five says the complex will attract 40 million shoppers, half of them tourists visiting New York City. At least some retailers have accepted that argument. Hudson Bay Company, which owns Saks Fifth Avenue and other stores, closed the Saks in nearby Summit, N.J., and has committed to opening a Saks, a Saks Off 5th discount store and a Lord & Taylor at American Dream.Primark, an Irish retailer of fast fashion, plans to open an American flagship there. And Toys \u201cR\u201d Us will open its own flagship as well as an F. A. O. Schwarz store.Alan Napack, a retail broker at Cushman & Wakefield who worked on the Primark deal, said he was a \u201cbeliever\u201d in the project.\u201cI think families from all around the tristate area will be going there a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cI think people from New York will go there for the entertainment. It\u2019s an excuse to get out of the city and do some cool things.\u201dStill, there are six large malls within a 16-minute drive of the site, near MetLife Stadium. And mall operators are under increasing pressure in the face of soaring internet sales. By one estimate, 200 regional malls across the country have vacancy rates of 35 percent or more.\u201cThere\u2019s no shortage of malls in the state of New Jersey, and there\u2019s no reason to create additional traffic in that corridor,\u201d said Lisa Washburn, a managing partner at Municipal Market Analytics, an independent research firm. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to create net new spending. You\u2019re just going to draw sales from one location to another.\u201dOriginally proposed in 2003, the project was first promoted as a new development at the state\u2019s sports and exposition complex that would not cost taxpayers a dime. The original developer, the Mills Corporation, made an upfront payment of $160 million on rent.Together, they spent a total of $1.9 billion on the project, which was then called Xanadu, before succumbing to heavy debts and a recession.During the recession in 2010, Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Barrack\u2019s companies lost their combined $600 million investment when lenders took control of the stalled project.The lenders then solicited proposals from a small group of developers, including Triple Five and TPG Real Estate Group, a large private equity investment firm, in partnership with Mr. Trump, according to Mr. Ghermezian and TPG. TPG ultimately did not make a formal bid.Triple Five got the deal. At the time, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican, announced the new mall would open in time for the 2014 Super Bowl, and he offered the developer public financing.On top of the $1.9 billion already spent, Triple Five is now planning to sell $1.15 billion in high-yield bonds, also known as junk bonds, to finish the project. The company is also seeking $1.5 billion in loans.Tony Armlin, Triple Five\u2019s vice president for development, said he expected to sell the bonds next month as the market settled. But there is no guarantee that will happen, and the bond sale is directly tied to the conventional loans.The Ghermezians, however, say they will pursue the project relentlessly. In addition to its other amenities, the complex is supposed to have a LegoLand entertainment center, an 18-hole miniature golf course, a performing arts center, a 300-foot-tall observation wheel, a professional-size ice rink and movie theaters.\u201cWe\u2019ve had to put out fires that we did not create,\u201d Mr. Ghermezian said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t bothered me because I\u2019m uncompromising.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Council Bill Could Make Campaign Fraud Easier in New York, Critics Say", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byThe Manhattan district attorney, government watchdog groups and campaign finance officials are criticizing legislation before the City Council for its potential to weaken New York City\u2019s landmark campaign finance system.Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the district attorney, sent a letter this week to Melissa Mark-Viverito, the Council speaker, and other council members warning that one bill being considered could make it easier for those seeking money under the city\u2019s matching funds program to commit fraud.The program provides a six-to-one match for up to $175 in contributions from an individual city resident, meaning a $175 contribution would open the door to an additional $1,050 in matching funds.The bill being considered would let candidates complete or make changes to contribution cards required of donors that give identifying information, including, among other things, the date and amount of contributions.\u201cThis bill would eliminate an important safeguard against violations of campaign finance law and the defrauding of taxpayers,\u201d Mr. Vance wrote in the letter, which The Daily News reported about on Friday.City Council officials said the bills being considered were still going through the legislative process and that concerns like those voiced by Mr. Vance would be weighed. A vote on the bills is expected before year\u2019s end.Rose Gill Hearn, chairwoman of the city\u2019s Campaign Finance Board, also criticized the contribution-card bill in a memo last month, saying it would complicate the task of detecting instances of fraud involving the matching funds program.Ms. Gill Hearn criticized several other proposals being considered by the Council, saying they could hamper the board\u2019s ability to do its job. She said the bills had advanced without sufficient deliberation, unlike other proposed reforms backed by the board that have languished for months but now are expected to win the Council\u2019s approval by year\u2019s end.\u201cThese unwelcome proposals should not be the cost of implementing those reforms,\u201d she wrote.One proposal drawing Ms. Gill Hearn\u2019s criticism would strictly limit who could attend the board\u2019s executive sessions, which are closed to the public. Ms. Gill Hearn said that could keep the board from consulting with its own staff members or others when considering penalties for campaign-finance violations. She also took issue with a proposal that would place new requirements on the board when a candidate contests its findings that a violation has occurred. In addition, she objected to a bill that would compel the board to report to the Council and mayor on efforts to make its software compatible with state Board of Elections\u2019 software.The bills are expected to be voted on along with other legislation long sought by advocates. That legislation includes a proposal to keep contributions bundled by lobbyists and others doing business with the city out of the matching-funds system.There are now strict limits on how much money lobbyists and those with business with the city can give to candidates directly, but those same people can raise unlimited sums from others that they can package together and give to candidates in a process known as bundling. Because bundled funds can qualify for the matching-funds program, the process greatly magnifies bundlers\u2019 influence.While the proposal on bundling would not ban it, it would remove the match for those funds \u2014 a significant improvement in the view of government watchdogs. The finance board proposed the change in 2014, and it has awaited a Council vote for months.Also under consideration is a bill that would strictly limit how much lobbyists or those doing business with the city can give to nonprofit groups controlled or created by elected officials. The bill is aimed at a practice used by Mayor Bill de Blasio, who was heavily criticized for the activities of the Campaign for One New York, a nonprofit created to support his agenda. The group received millions of dollars in donations from builders, lobbyists, unions and others. The mayor, a Democrat, shut the group down this year, but its actions and fund-raising practices have been the subject of multiple investigations.Ms. Mark-Viverito, a Democrat, said at a news conference this week that she believed the bills under consideration \u201cwill actually improve the system and make it more efficient.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Great Barrier Reef Threatened by Climate Change, Chemicals and Sediment", "Date": "2016-12-01", "News": "Supported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 Climate change and the flow of farm chemicals and coastal sediment into the waters that wash over one of Australia\u2019s most significant nature areas, the Great Barrier Reef, pose the biggest threats to its survival, according to a government report to Unesco released early Friday.The report was intended to reassure the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization that those risks were well managed and that the reef should not be placed on an \u201cin danger\u201d list. But it paints a grim picture of the scale of protecting the 1,400-mile-long reef, and may severely understate the cost of doing so.The report also ignores plans by the Queensland State government to allow the development of one of the world\u2019s biggest coal mines about 200 miles from the reef, and it does not acknowledge the damage to the reef that could flow from the mine.The update shows that of 151 planned measures, including the limiting of sediment and chemical runoff from farms and the better management of starfish predators, 32 have been completed and 103 are underway or on track to begin. At least one is stalled, after the Queensland Parliament rejected laws to prevent land clearing, which speeds erosion and can lead to more sediment flowing into the Pacific Ocean.But in an introduction to the report, Ian Chubb, formerly Australia\u2019s chief scientist and now the chairman of an independent panel on the reef, warned that climate change posed the most significant threat. \u201cThe major impacts on the reef will most likely result from the long-term release of substantial quantities of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,\u201d he wrote.\u201cThere are effects already,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis year saw the most significant coral bleaching event ever recorded for the reef.\u201dReef 2050 was a response to the Unesco World Heritage Committee\u2019s call for a long-term management plan to ensure the reef retained the World Heritage status it received in 1981. Last year, the United Nations warned that the reef\u2019s outlook was poor, and it asked for an updated report and for evidence of the plan\u2019s effectiveness, as well as an investment strategy to finance the efforts.That study, released in July, said the cost for meeting targets along the length of the reef was 8.2 billion Australian dollars, or about $6 billion, to be spent over 10 years. That figure was sharply higher than the roughly $1.5 billion the state and federal governments said would be spent over the next decade on all measures to protect the reef.\u201cThe scale of the investment required is commensurate with the scale of the challenge,\u201d the study said. \u201cVirtually all of the relevant science indicates the Great Barrier Reef is in decline.\u201dThe report to Unesco on Friday said that about $950 million had already been committed to reef-specific measures over the next five years. That amount is part of the federal and the state governments\u2019 $1.5 billion commitment over a decade.The federal and Queensland governments said the study\u2019s overall cost estimate included \u201csome very expensive high-risk actions,\u201d like nearly $4.2 billion for erosion in one valley to prevent the flow of sediment into the ocean. Removal of that big-ticket item brought the study\u2019s report closer into line financially with the government report to Unesco.The report on Friday was only an update. It did not offer new spending measures for the reef, nor new targets to reduce pollution. It is likely to draw sharp criticism from environmentalists.The report to Unesco said the reef\u2019s scale and resilience meant it could recover from the bleaching this year. It said that managing the risks to the reef would be difficult, but that there was a determination to succeed. \u201cThe progress to date does not reduce the urgency to address key issues and risks,\u201d it said.Advertisement"}

On Thursday, he will begin consulting with the leaders of Italy\u2019s political parties to verify the various options open to him.The Italian president could call for new elections, but he has made clear that he will not consider returning to the polls before a new electoral law has been passed. The current electoral law for the lower house is under review by Italy\u2019s constitutional court. The court announced on Tuesday that it would issue a decision on the constitutionality of the law, known as the Italicum, on Jan. 24.Another electoral law applies to the Senate, and Mr. Mattarella says he will not call new elections until a single electoral system covers both houses of Parliament, the Italian news media reported.The government crisis did not appear to rattle the Italian stock market on Wednesday, which closed up 2.1 percent. Even Italy\u2019s banks, saddled with bad loans, closed higher.Political stability has always been elusive in Italy. A combination of a multiparty system and its electoral laws make it difficult for any one party to have a strong majority.Mr. Renzi had campaigned vigorously in favor of the changes to the Constitution, but 59.1 percent of the voters rejected them.The referendum and subsequent fall of Mr. Renzi further aggravated this fissure, and speculation was rife in the news media this week over Mr. Renzi\u2019s role at the helm of the party.\u201cThere\u2019s an internal discussion that must be held that I think will be difficult,\u201d Mr. Renzi told members of his party on Wednesday afternoon. But he asked that the showdown not take place until after the Italian president resolves the government crisis. Mr. Renzi also said he would not be part of the delegation that is to meet with Mr. Matterella in coming days.The failure of the measures on the referendum call for \u201cample considerations,\u201d he said during a relaxed, joke-filled 20-minute speech at the party\u2019s headquarters. He was warmly applauded.The problems that he, and the Parliament, had hoped to resolve through the proposed changes to the Constitution still have to be dealt with, he said.In a nod to the populist pull of the Five Star Movement, the party set to pose the biggest threat in the next elections, Mr. Renzi took a page from their playbook and said that his party\u2019s discussions in coming days would be streamed online. \u201cWe want to be transparent to all citizens, and to our people,\u201d Mr. Renzi said.Various people have been discussed as possible successors to Mr. Renzi, Among them are Pietro Grasso, president of the Senate, and Pier Carlo Padoan, Italy\u2019s finance minister, who is respected in Europe. The president could also ask Mr. Renzi\u2019s party to try to form another government.In a newsletter published on his website on Wednesday, Mr. Renzi said he was not in a position to decide on Italy\u2019s future anymore. \u201cThe parties \u2014 all the parties \u2014 must accept their responsibilities,\u201d he wrote.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "At De Beers: Millennials and Diamonds", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 \u201cMaybe we won\u2019t ever get married, and maybe we will \u2026 but it will be wild, it will be kind, and it will be real.\u201dSo says the voice-over for a short film created for the Diamond Producers Association\u2019s \u201cReal Is Rare\u201d marketing campaign. Aimed squarely at millennials and partly financed by De Beers, the dominant diamond producer, its introduction came just weeks after Bruce Cleaver\u2019s appointment as that company\u2019s chief executive in July. And the piece neatly sums up the challenges \u2014 and opportunities \u2014 the diamond industry presented him this year.His job has recently taken him to Botswana, South Africa and Namibia. \u201cA fairly standard kind of week,\u201d Mr. Cleaver, 51, said with a smile as he sat in the De Beers office in central London. Beside him was a table displaying an array of diamond jewelry, its centerpiece a simple but striking diamond line necklace that seemed to dazzle from every possible angle.Although about 95 percent of De Beers\u2019s revenue comes from mining and producing diamonds, ensuring demand at the other end of the supply chain by winning over millennials is critical to the long-term economic health of the industry, and the cornerstone of Mr. Cleaver\u2019s strategy: \u201cThe campaign is about millennials; it\u2019s not aimed at the traditional successful couple that you\u2019d see in advertising even five years ago \u2014 it\u2019s not about diamond buyers on Fifth Avenue.\u201dIn 2015, De Beers data showed, millennials spent nearly $26 billion on diamond jewelry in China, India, Japan and the United States, 45 percent of the total retail value of all new diamond jewelry that year, and making them the largest group of diamond retail consumers. And the numbers are expected to grow as millennials reach financial maturity.\u201cWe know that they are invested in the diamond dream, but they don\u2019t like being told what to do, and there is tendency for brands to underestimate them,\u201d Mr. Cleaver said \u2014 and as the father of two millennial teenagers, he speaks from experience. \u201cThey want fulfilling and meaningful relationships \u2014 and diamonds are given at life\u2019s great moments, so they fulfill an enormous emotional need.\u201dAnglo American, which has an 85 percent stake in De Beers, is betting on millennial diamond consumers. It put diamonds, precious metals and copper at the core of its leaner portfolio at the beginning of the year.For Mr. Cleaver, who served as group director of strategy and business development at Anglo American and before that was responsible for strategy at De Beers, the challenge is adjusting the product offering to consumers who are progressing more slowly down the traditional life path than previous generations, who place a premium on individuality, and take a more casual approach to wearing jewelry \u2014 and to marriage.While weddings and gifts to married women continue to be the backbone of the diamond jewelry business in the United States, accounting for 65 percent of all sales by value, the proportion has fallen from 70 percent in 2013, Mr. Cleaver said, with more millennial women buying their own jewelry.The United States continues to be De Beers\u2019s largest market, providing 45 percent of all sales. And Mr. Cleaver said that, despite some dark economic predictions after the presidential election, he is positive about the future. \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if it has any material impact, and there are those who think it will impact positively; lower tax means more disposable income,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the short term, we\u2019ll have to watch what happens.\u201dThe growth outlook for China and India is a key focus, with the company increasing its marketing to help drive sales among the wealthy and aspiring middle-class customers in those countries.But China is a difficult country to read, Mr. Cleaver added: \u201cWe found that Chinese consumers are still buying; they are perhaps buying more intelligently than they used to. They travel to areas where the currency is weaker, so there is still potential growth \u2014 but we wouldn\u2019t expect major growth in China in the next year or so.\u201dRetail strikes in India led to disappointing results for the first half of 2016, but it remains a \u201ctantalizing\u201d market as the middle class grows, Mr. Cleaver said, adding, \u201cThe country is heavily invested in the gold business, but becoming invested in the diamond business, too.\u201d He said that he believes changes made by the current Indian government will create growth and, hopefully, opportunity. \u201cIt\u2019s an overused phrase, but I am cautiously optimistic about 2017 for the business,\u201d he said.De Beers traditionally sells only the rough diamonds that it mines and produces, but its Singapore-based auction facility has become one of Mr. Cleaver\u2019s focuses as the company tries to diversify.Approximately 90 percent of De Beers\u2019s rough diamonds are sold through selling events to authorized bulk buyers known as sightholders; the rest are sold to small- and medium-size companies in online auctions. But in July, De Beers began testing the sale of diamonds polished by other companies. \u201cOriginally, the online auctions were a price discovery mechanism, so you could auction goods to test what other people might pay for those goods,\u201d Mr. Cleaver said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve seen clients migrate from being relatively small auction participants to long-term contractual clients, and we think the business has tremendous potential to grow our earnings base.\u201dTechnological innovation at every stage in the diamond supply chain is essential to the industry\u2019s survival, Mr. Cleaver added. \u201cMining \u2014 and I don\u2019t confine this to De Beers \u2014 needs to be more tech savvy,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018It doesn\u2019t have to be grand technology. If you can take every little incremental bit of what you do in the mine and do it better with technology, you will make your mines more efficient, you will make your yields better.\u201dThe company has been investing, he said, in technologies like accurate automated drilling and blasting and synthetic-diamond detection technology.Technological innovation also is being studied in retail, partly because of millennials, Mr. Cleaver said.\u201cWe need to get consumers feeling engaged in the purchase process when they come into the store,\u201d he noted. \u201cTraditionally, that\u2019s not easy because it takes a long time to create a design. But will 3-D printing change that in the future? I don\u2019t see why not.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia Says Aleppo Combat Has Ceased; Residents Disagree", "Date": "2016-12-08", "News": "Supported byMr. Lavrov, who spoke on the sidelines of a meeting of foreign ministers in Germany, did not offer specifics on an evacuation plan. But civilians inside the remaining rebel-held districts of eastern Aleppo were in a state of panic after a day in which rescue workers said 150 airstrikes had killed at least 50 people and in which residents said they were unable to flee because of the intense combat.Residents said by telephone that they could hear drones and tank fire and that they feared government forces were closing in on the few neighborhoods still held by rebels. Several said they had not heard of evacuation offers and begged to be told of any chances to escape.At the United Nations, the agency\u2019s envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told reporters he could not verify whether the fighting had stopped or whether civilians were being allowed to evacuate, and he pressed the government authorities to let them leave safely and with protection from United Nations staff.His remarks followed a closed-door session of the Security Council, in which Mr. de Mistura said that government forces could take control of the remaining rebel-held parts of Aleppo by the end of the year and that rebel forces should be allowed to leave the city safely, if they wished, according to diplomats present.Josh Earnest, the White House spokesman, called them \u201can indication that something positive could happen, but we\u2019re going to have to wait and see.\u201d He added, \u201cOur approach to the situation has been to listen carefully to what the Russians say, but scrutinize their actions.\u201dPleas for help from eastern Aleppo escalated on Thursday, with doctors warning that they could no longer provide more than first aid. Some residents reached via telephone and text message were fleeing from the front lines into the center of the shrinking enclave, while others stayed near the edges, hoping to evacuate but complaining that the combatants would not pause to let them escape.The recapture of most of the rebel-held part of Aleppo by the government is a potential turning point in Syria\u2019s war, which began in 2011 with largely peaceful street protests demanding political change and evolved into armed conflict after government crackdowns.Mr. Assad told Al Watan, a pro-government newspaper, that victory in Aleppo \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean the end of the war in Syria. It is a significant landmark toward the end of the battle, but the war in Syria will not end until terrorism is eliminated,\u201d he said, referring to insurgents.The International Committee of the Red Cross said that it had evacuated more than 140 civilians from a part of Aleppo\u2019s old city that had been retaken by the government, mainly residents of a home for older people, and that it had recovered the bodies of 11 people who had died of lack of medical care.The White Helmets organization, which rescues people from bombing sites and has financing from Western countries, issued a statement saying that it feared a massacre, and asking to evacuate its volunteers, who have been accused by the Syrian government of colluding with terrorists. \u201cIf we are not evacuated, our volunteers face torture and execution in the regime\u2019s detention centers,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe have good reason to fear for our lives.\u201dBombs containing chlorine, banned as a weapon by international law, fell on the front line near the Kalasseh neighborhood, sickening about 30 people, the White Helmets said.Salem Abul Nasser, a dentist, said he had hoped for a few quiet hours after Mr. Lavrov spoke and had fallen asleep, only to be wakened when a corpse of a man newly killed on the front line and another person apparently suffering from chlorine inhalation were brought to his clinic.Showing the body over an online video chat, he broke into tears, saying: \u201cI was hoping it would be a real cease-fire. Now I\u2019m deeply disappointed and pessimistic. The shelling resumed now; I can hear it.\u201dThe United Nations humanitarian chief, Jan Egeland, expressed frustration that aid deliveries had not been approved by the Syrian government in November \u2014 when front lines were more stable \u2014 and that now the United States and Russia, as well as the Syrian combatants, could not agree on a plan to deliver aid and evacuate civilians who want to leave.Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry issued an angry and sarcastic response to a statement from six Western countries a day earlier that had warned of a humanitarian catastrophe in Aleppo. The ministry said that Russia was providing aid to residents it said had been liberated from a terrorist occupation.\u201cIf you are ready to render aid to residents of Aleppo, let us know where this aid is located,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAnd if you just don\u2019t have any aid, letters and empty promises won\u2019t fill bellies of Aleppo\u2019s residents!\u201dMr. Lavrov\u2019s comments on a halt in fighting came on the eve of new efforts, albeit entirely symbolic, at the United Nations to press for a pause in fighting. Led by Canada, the United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to vote on a draft resolution that calls for a \u201ccessation of hostilities\u201d for an undefined period of time and that allows humanitarian aid to be delivered. It would have no force of law.The Russian ambassador, Vitaly I. Churkin, described it as \u201cnot very effective.\u201dSomini Sengupta contributed reporting from the United Nations, Oleg Matsnev from Moscow, and Hwaida Saad from Beirut.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Looks to Lead the Trump Resistance", "Date": "2016-12-09", "News": "Supported byEditorialNobody knows yet what Donald Trump is going to do to immigration enforcement. Only a month has passed since the election, and the president-elect is no different from the candidate: erratic, self-contradictory, hazy on principles and policies.But states and cities that value immigrants, including the undocumented, do not have the luxury of waiting and hoping for the best. They are girding for a confrontation, building defenses to protect families and workers from the next administration.They fear that Mr. Trump, who ran on a pledge of mass deportation, dehumanizing immigrants and refugees, will remove humane discretion from immigration enforcement. They understand that not all unauthorized immigrants are criminals, that not all should be detained or deported and that the country cannot enforce its way out of its failure to reform unjust immigration laws.But they know that the nativist ideologues and white nationalists around Mr. Trump are itching for him to be merciless. They know that if he does anything close to what he has repeatedly vowed to do \u2014 set dragnets for millions of unauthorized immigrants, triple the number of enforcement officers, immediately revoke President Obama\u2019s administrative actions shielding young people from deportation and pull federal funds from cities that defend immigrants \u2014 their prudence will have been justified.\u201cNobody wants bad people in our communities or neighborhoods or in our streets,\u201d Mr. de Le\u00f3n said, particularly the local and state police. \u201cThey\u2019ll always go after the rapist, the violent criminal drug dealer; we\u2019ve made that abundantly clear.\u201dExpect Mr. Trump and his immigration brain trust, led by the Senate hard-liner Jeff Sessions and ideologues like Kris Kobach, the secretary of state of Kansas, to denounce all such efforts as providing sanctuary to dangerous criminals.But the opposite is true: By drawing a bright line between federal immigration enforcement and local policing, the California Values Act would promote smarter, more effective law enforcement. Local officers would continue to keep the peace, and in the face of criminal threats \u2014 as validated by a warrant from a judge \u2014 would cooperate with federal agents. But if the Trump administration begins roundups of those who pose no danger, of minor offenders and noncriminals, staking out schools, churches, businesses and homes \u2014 they will not do its job for it.\u201cWe\u2019re not looking for a fight with the president-elect and his administration,\u201d said Mr. de Le\u00f3n. \u201cWe\u2019re guided by the principles of justice and dignity for all people.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Taps Linda McMahon to Head Small Business Administration", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byTransition Briefing\u25a0 President-elect Donald J. Trump taps wrestling impresario for Small Business Administration.\u25a0 President-elect: \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything to divide\u201d the country.\u25a0 The governor of Iowa is the president-elect\u2019s choice for ambassador to China.\u25a0 Saving the Dreamers.Linda McMahon, the former chief executive officer of World Wrestling Entertainment, was selected on Wednesday by Mr. Trump to head the Small Business Administration, adding another billionaire to the president-elect\u2019s affluent stable.\u201cLinda has a tremendous background and is widely recognized as one of the country\u2019s top female executives advising businesses around the globe. She helped grow W.W.E. from a modest 13-person operation to a publicly traded global enterprise with more than 800 employees in offices worldwide,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement.Ms. McMahon, a failed Senate candidate from Connecticut, was with her husband Vince one of Mr. Trump\u2019s biggest campaign donors. She contributed $6 million to a \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting Mr. Trump in August and September, according to federal election filings.And, of course, Mr. Trump has shown a great facility for professional wrestling, so the choice makes sense.In an interview with Time for its person of the year issue, and a follow-up with NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show, Mr. Trump talked tough.\u25a0 He insisted he has nothing to do with the \u201cdivided states of America\u201d that Time says he will lead. \u201cWhen you say divided states of America, I didn\u2019t divide them,\u201d he told NBC. \u201cI\u2019m not president yet, so I didn\u2019t do anything to divide.\u201d\u201cWell, hey, look, this is bad stuff,\u201d Mr. Trump told Time. \u201cThey slice them up, they carve their initials in the girl\u2019s forehead, O.K.? What are we supposed to do? Be nice about it?\u201d\u25a0 He rejected United States intelligence conclusions that Russia was behind hacks at the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign that boosted his campaign. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it. I don\u2019t believe they interfered,\u201d Mr. Trump said of the Russians.\u25a0 And he again said he would press Boeing on an Air Force One upgrade, though his Twitter order to \u201ccancel\u201d the project seems to have faded. \u201cI\u2019m going to negotiate prices, and the planes are too expensive, and we\u2019re going to get the prices down.\u201dRepresentative Keith Ellison said Wednesday he would resign his House seat if he is elected chair of the Democratic National Committee, sweeping away an impediment to his bid for the party post while denying his critics a handy argument against his controversial candidacy.\u201cWhoever wins the D.N.C. chair race faces a lot of work, travel, planning and resource raising. I will be \u2018all-in\u2019 to meet the challenge,\u2019\u201d Mr. Ellison said in a statement.A range of prominent Democrats have expressed unease about installing a part-time chairman at the D.N.C. at a time when the party is shut out of power in Washington. But that argument against Mr. Ellison has also served as a stand-in for broader, and more delicate, concerns about the liberal Minnesotan. Some Jewish Democrats are nervous about his past ties to the Nation of Islam and comments about Israel.Haim Saban, one of the party\u2019s biggest donors, said Mr. Ellison would be \u201ca disaster\u201d for Democrats.President-elect Trump sounded more conciliatory toward Boeing on Wednesday after its chief executive promised to help control the cost of a proposed new Air Force One plane.Mr. Trump had tweeted \u201cCancel Order!\u201d on Tuesday after writing that it could cost over $4 billion to build two of the jets with high-tech communications and security by the mid-2020s.But in a telephone interview with the Today Show, Mr. Trump said that he had since talked to the Boeing executive, Dennis Muilenburg, saying he was a \u201cterrific guy, and we\u2019re going to work it out.\u201d Mr. Trump said he would negotiate lower prices or \u201cwe\u2019re not going to order them, we\u2019ll stay with what we have.\u201dMr. Trump said he had tweeted about the project after hearing the cost estimates. He said he had not seen a Chicago Tribune article citing Mr. Muilenburg\u2019s concerns about his trade policies that was posted shortly before his tweet.For all his talk of punishing China, President-elect Trump has chosen a conciliator with a personal relationship with China\u2019s president to be his ambassador in Beijing.Mr. Branstad, whose selection was first reported by Bloomberg News and confirmed on condition of anonymity on Wednesday by two people with direct knowledge, is close to President Xi Jinping, whom he has known for more than three decades. They met in 1985, when Mr. Branstad was serving his first term as governor of Iowa and Mr. Xi was a 31-year-old rural official in Hebei Province, studying modern American agriculture, including hog and corn farming in Iowa.Mr. Branstad has courted China as governor, promoting his state\u2019s farm goods. As ambassador, he would be tasked with managing a complex relationship that Mr. Trump has already indicated he is willing to shake up. The president-elect\u2019s call with Taiwan\u2019s president last week prompted criticism from Beijing, which considers it a breakaway province, and Mr. Trump responded with posts on Twitter attacking China for its trade practices and provocative moves in the South China Sea.Facing intense pressure over the so-called \u201cDreamers,\u201d young people brought to the United States by their undocumented parents and allowed to stay under President Obama, Mr. Trump appears to be softening his stance on whether to deport the more than 700,000 of them.\u201cWe\u2019re going work something out that\u2019s going to make people happy and proud,\u201d Mr. Trump told Time. \u201cThey got brought here at a very young age, they\u2019ve worked here, they\u2019ve gone to school here. Some were good students. Some have wonderful jobs. And they\u2019re in never-never land because they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201dMr. Trump did not go into specifics or say he would reverse his promise to reverse Mr. Obama\u2019s executive actions, including the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which protected young undocumented immigrants from deportation.The Dreamers are likely to present Mr. Trump with the first major domestic policy test of administration, as many of his campaign promises clash with more moderate Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill who have implored Mr. Trump not to deny these young adults protective status.Many of Mr. Trump\u2019s top advisers and potential cabinet members, including his nominee for attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, however, oppose Mr. Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration and other measures that would allow undocumented immigrants to stay in the U.S.Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago made the case to Mr. Trump personally on Wednesday. Emerging into the Trump Tower lobby, Mr. Emanuel said:\u201cI delivered to the president-elect, his senior adviser and his chief of staff a letter signed by 14 mayors put together from across the country about DACA students, that they were working hard toward the American dream, and that all of us fundamentally believe that these are students, these are also people who want to join the armed forces, they gave their name, their address, their phone number, where they are, they\u2019re trying to achieve the American dream, it\u2019s no fault of their own their parents came here. They are something we should hold up and embrace.\u201dAt a breakfast fund-raiser at Manhattan\u2019s Cipriani 42nd Street, Mr. Trump on Wednesday gave a tantalizing hint at the inaugural festivities to come for a reality TV star-turned-president: The helicopter grand entrance.The president-elect said he was paid a visit a day earlier by Mark Burnett, the executive producer of \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d the reality show that helped make the president-elect a household name. Mr. Trump told the crowd that Mr. Burnett proposed reinventing the inauguration with a helicopter taking off from New York City, according to an attendee.Mr. Burnett, who is known for producing shows like \u201cSurvivor,\u201d \u201cThe Voice\u201d and \u201cShark Tank\u201d as well, also told Mr. Trump that he should consider a parade up Fifth Avenue.The group planning Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration has secured about $50 million in pledged donations since it began fund-raising in earnest last week, a breakneck pace that promises a glittering event, according to two people involved in the effort.The early success puts Mr. Trump on pace to easily surpass President Obama\u2019s 2009 inauguration, when his finance team raised a record $53 million to fund the inaugural festivities.As the magazine\u2019s editor in chief, Nancy Gibbs, put it:\u201cFor reminding America that demagoguery feeds on despair and that truth is only as powerful as the trust in those who speak it, for empowering a hidden electorate by mainstreaming its furies and live-streaming its fears, and for framing tomorrow\u2019s political culture by demolishing yesterday\u2019s, Donald Trump is Time\u2019s 2016 person of the year.\u201dMr. Trump accentuated the positive.\u201cIt\u2019s a great honor, it means a lot, especially me growing up reading Time magazine,\u201d he said on the \u201cToday\u201d show on NBC after the choice was announced. Throughout the campaign, Mr. Trump bragged at rallies about how frequently he was on the magazine\u2019s cover.And hey, last year, he said it would never happen.Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, one of the most conservative Democrats in Congress, says he is trying to find time for a second trip to Trump Tower in New York, this time to see Reince Priebus, tapped to be the next White House chief of staff.\u201cI\u2019m anxious to talk to him,\u201d he said.What Mr. Manchin wants is unclear. Asked if he were open to serving in the cabinet, he answered, \u201cI\u2019m just anxious to help my country and help my state.\u201dAnd what an appointment would mean to Mr. Trump is equally unclear. The other red state Democrat being wooed by the Trump transition team, Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, is a more obvious target. Her seat would be filled by an appointment made by North Dakota\u2019s incoming Republican governor, Doug Burgum, giving Republicans a little more cushion for their narrow Senate majority.Mr. Manchin\u2019s successor would be named by West Virginia\u2019s incoming Democratic governor, Jim Justice.With Hillary Clinton\u2019s lead in the popular vote reaching 2.7 million votes, the Democrats\u2019 losses are looking increasingly improbable but very real. They are annotated on Twitter by David Wasserman, House editor of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.History is a game of inches \u2014 or a few thousand votes in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Shielding Seized Assets From Corruption\u2019s Clutches", "Date": "2016-12-30", "News": "An effort by the United States to seize assets from officials who stole their countries\u2019 wealth is now focused on returning the loot without enriching the looters.Supported byOne would think that an iconic Michael Jackson \u201cBad Tour\u201d glove, covered in Swarovski crystals and worn on his first solo tour, would rest in a place of honor, perhaps at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland.Hardly. The bejeweled glove is thousands of miles away in the oil-rich, deeply impoverished country of Equatorial Guinea. And the people of this West African nation, most of whom live on less than $2 a day, have paid dearly for it.This is something that few other nations attempt. Now comes the hard part: returning the seized money to the people of the countries affected without enriching a kleptocrat all over again.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to see the funds disappear and go back to those who caused the harm,\u201d said Leslie R. Caldwell, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division.Some $3 billion, involving nations worldwide, has been frozen by the program \u2014 including a Malibu mansion and a $500,000 Ferrari (but not the white glove) owned by a member of Equatorial Guinea\u2019s ruling family, the Obiangs. The family\u2019s patriarch is so wealthy that he tops Queen Elizabeth II on lists of the global rich.This repatriation effort is getting started just as Donald J. Trump\u2019s election as president threatens to complicate the message of the kleptocracy initiative. Mr. Trump, a Republican, has promised to avoid potential conflicts of interest between his business empire and his duties as commander in chief, and has indicated he will come up with a plan before the inauguration.Mr. Trump\u2019s actions will have special resonance for a program that goes after foreign leaders whose business and government positions are porous. There are worries that if Mr. Trump does not sufficiently distance his business and his family from politics, it will be tougher for the Justice Department to criticize foreign leaders who have become wealthy based on their government ties.\u201cThe election of Donald Trump might impede the commitment of the United States to fight kleptocracy,\u201d said Matthew C. Stephenson, a professor who teaches anticorruption law at Harvard Law School. \u201cThe political consequences are that it reduces U.S. leverage because of the perceived hypocrisy. The moral case is drastically undermined.\u201dTutu Alicante, executive director of EG Justice, a Washington nonprofit that monitors corruption in Africa, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect scenario for kleptocrats in Africa to point to someone in the White House. They will compare themselves to Donald Trump.\u201dRepresentatives of both the Justice Department and Mr. Trump did not respond to requests for comment.The Obiang case is the biggest to date and, for that reason, is being closely watched. It is also the rare time that the kleptocracy initiative has gone after such a senior officeholder. A member of the Obiang family bought many of his assets as part of a \u201ccorruption fueled spending spree,\u201d according to the Justice Department.Under an agreement with the department, Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, the son of Equatorial Guinea\u2019s president, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, has promised to give up valuables he amassed in the United States, ending years of litigation. His title is vice president, with an official salary of around $100,000. His father came to power in a coup in 1979 and is the longest-serving African leader and president in the world, ruling with \u201calmost total control,\u201d according to a recent report from the Central Intelligence Agency. The son is seen as a possible heir apparent.The Justice Department hailed its agreement with the younger Mr. Obiang as a significant step forward for its program. The idea is to create a charity in Equatorial Guinea funded by $30 million from the sale of his 15,000-square-foot Malibu oceanfront mansion, the Ferrari 599 and other assets, including additional Jackson memorabilia.\u201cWe are touching the untouchables,\u201d Ms. Caldwell said. \u201cWe are saying that the U.S. financial system is not a safe haven for corruption.\u201dThe department has both a desire and an obligation to repatriate assets flowing through the American banking system. The United States, along with 140 other countries, is a signatory to the United Nations Convention Against Corruption, an agreement requiring countries to hunt down the offshore money of corrupt officials and return it to the victimized countries. The World Bank estimates that from $20 billion to $40 billion is stolen annually by corrupt public officials, mostly in poor and developing countries.So far only a small number of nations are actively pursuing kleptocracy cases \u2014 mainly the United States, Britain, Canada, Luxembourg and Switzerland. This is in part because few countries have the resources to take on the complicated cases.Ownership of the assets is often hidden by a web of shell companies. Offshore accounts created by sharp lawyers and accountants can be hard to trace. A court must determine whether other interested parties have valid claims to ownership and if the assets were bought with illicitly obtained money. Only then can the assets be seized and the money repatriated.The corrupt assets that the Justice Department has tracked down are valued at $3 billion and have come from a laundry list of countries \u2014 Nigeria, Ukraine and Uzbekistan among them. In the case of Malaysia, money was also used to buy a $35 million jet, pay for gambling in Las Vegas and buy art by Van Gogh and Monet. The actor Leonardo DiCaprio, whose movie \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d was produced by the company tied to the Malaysian case, has said he was cooperating with the government case and would return any funds that his charity or the movie received that turned out to have been stolen.In the largest case against a person, the Justice Department is seeking $850 million from Gulnara Karimova, the socialite daughter of the late president of Uzbekistan who goes by the nickname Googoosha. The Harvard-educated former model and pop singer is accused by the United States of accepting bribes to allow a Dutch telecom company to enter the Uzbek market. A leaked American diplomatic cable said she was the \u201cthe single most hated person\u201d in Uzbekistan and a \u201cgreedy power hungry individual.\u201d After a falling out with her father in 2014, Ms. Karimova was placed under house arrest, where she remains today.Three lawyers representing Uzbekistan in the Justice Department matter did not respond to requests for comment, nor did officials at the Uzbekistan Embassy in Washington. In court filings, lawyers representing Uzbekistan argue that the United States has \u201cat best a minimal interest in the bribery and money-laundering scheme\u201d involving Ms. Karimova because \u201cthe corruption alleged in the complaint is fundamentally an Uzbek matter.\u201dAnother big-ticket case involves Gen. Sani Abacha of Nigeria, who died nearly two decades ago. His case has wended through the courts since then. In play is $630 million from his estate that the United States says he and his cronies laundered through the American financial system. The United States has gained access to $480 million and is in litigation over the rest.Daniel Horowitz, Mr. Lazarenko\u2019s lawyer, said that there had been \u201czero evidence of wrongdoing\u201d by Mr. Lazarenko and that \u201cthe case is about the U.S. government wanting to keep the money.\u201d He described Ukraine as \u201ca place with no rules\u201d and added that \u201c80 percent of the world outside the United States and Europe has no rules.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to determine what is right and wrong,\u201d Mr. Horowitz said.The World Bank is tracking the offshore money of leaders toppled during the Arab Spring, including those of Egypt, Libya and Tunisia. Some money has been repatriated to the Tunisian treasury to help stabilize the country. In the cases of Libya and Egypt, the countries are so unstable and dangerous, though, that repatriation is impossible. An estimated $200 million in offshore assets of the Assad family of Syria and their associates were frozen by Switzerland, the European Union and the United States.\u201cAsset recovery is highly contentious and difficult to negotiate,\u201d said Emile van der Does de Willebois, global lead for financial market integrity at the World Bank. \u201cThe victim country can say that this is our money, we need it and we want it back.\u201d But, he said, \u201cWe can\u2019t just give back a blank check.\u201dEquatorial Guinea shows why. Under an agreement with the Justice Department, $20 million from the sale of Teodoro Obiang\u2019s American assets will be given to a charitable organization selected by the agency and Mr. Obiang. Another $10 million will be administered solely by the United States.But the big question is whether the department can structure a charity so that the money is not controlled by the Obiangs or used to enhance their image and power. That is a tall order for Justice Department lawyers who are more accustomed to hunting down bad characters than to setting up offshore charities.\u201cThis is a challenge and very different than what prosecutors are trained to do,\u201d said Mr. Stephenson, the Harvard professor.Complicating matters in Equatorial Guinea is that there are almost no existing charities. That is largely because the Obiang family has clamped down on any organization that promotes democracy or challenges its rule.\u201cThis won\u2019t be an easy process,\u201d said Mr. Alicante of EG Justice, which promotes human rights in that country. \u201cUnless the U.S. government stays alert, the money will disappear through corruption and we\u2019ll be back at square one.\u201dThe $30 million from the sale of Mr. Obiang\u2019s Malibu mansion, his Ferrari and assorted Jackson statues is currently in an escrow account controlled by the Justice Department. The Equatorial Guinean Embassy and Mr. Obiang\u2019s American lawyers did not respond to several requests for comment. Ms. Caldwell, of the Justice Department, said plans for the repatriation of the Obiang money were still being made final under the terms of the court agreement.Of that amount, the Justice Department had targeted $70 million in Mr. Obiang\u2019s American assets and was outfoxed, ending up with only about half that amount. Mr. Obiang kept his $38 million Gulfstream jet flying around the world, only in locations where the United States lacked jurisdiction to seize it. That meant, though, that he was unable to have regular servicing performed on the aircraft, which has depressed its value \u2014 and made it less attractive to potential passengers.As for the Jackson glove, it was spirited out of the United States in defiance of an American court order, according to prosecutors.The French authorities have helped by seizing a multimillion-dollar fleet of Mr. Obiang\u2019s exotic cars, including a $2 million Bugatti Veyron and two $600,000 Rolls-Royce Drophead Coup\u00e9s, a $380,000 Lamborghini Murci\u00e9lago and a $424,000 Bentley Azure. Mr. Obiang is scheduled to go on trial in Paris next week on corruption and money laundering charges after losing a bid in early December before the International Court of Justice to halt the proceedings.On Dec. 2, at the request of the Swiss, the Dutch authorities seized Mr. Obiang\u2019s 250-foot, $100 million yacht, \u201cEbony Shine,\u201d as it was about to sail to Equatorial Guinea, according to the Swiss publication L\u2019Hebdo. Mr. Obiang denied ownership of the yacht, saying that it belonged his country\u2019s government. He has another yacht based in Tangier.Andreas Ledergerber, a spokesman for the Swiss Embassy in Washington, said that, in spite of criticism, the repatriated money \u201ccontributed to the mine-removal process\u201d at the end of the Angola civil war, where antipersonnel mines remain a \u201cmajor danger to the population.\u201dSwitzerland also repatriated more than $500 million of seized Abacha money to Nigeria to be used for health, education, water and roads. Instead, the money disappeared into the country\u2019s general budget with no oversight, according to a World Bank report. And in Egypt, the tumultuous political situation caused many repatriation cases to be dropped.On the brighter side is Kazakhstan, where the BOTA Foundation was created with $115 million in seized money under an agreement among the United States, Switzerland and Kazakhstan. The foundation established in 2009 to help the country\u2019s poor is now held up as a model to emulate.The foundation was able to operate without interference from the country\u2019s ruling elite and to fulfill its mandate successfully. A total of $79 million went for social service and education programs that helped an estimated 200,000 people. Even so, BOTA drew some criticism for administrative and start-up costs that took about a third of the money, and because it did not continue operating after the original money was spent.Some countries are so corrupt that repatriation may not even be possible, experts say. Uzbekistan may be one of them.A recent C.I.A. report described Uzbekistan as being plagued by \u201cpervasive corruption.\u201d Its citizens, including children, are subject to \u201cgovernment-compelled forced labor\u201d in the country\u2019s cotton fields, according to the report. It also found \u201cofficial complicity in human trafficking.\u201dYet Uzbekistan occupies a strategic location in Central Asia and on an important logistics supply route for troops in Afghanistan. That limits the extent to which the United States can challenge the country\u2019s ruling family.The Justice Department\u2019s case focuses on Ms. Karimova, who was once seen as her father\u2019s successor until their falling out. She did not attend his funeral in September.She designed a line of jewelry, perfume and clothing, although her 2011 show at New York Fashion Week was canceled amid protests over Uzbekistan\u2019s human rights violations. She served as the country\u2019s ambassador to Spain and representative to the United Nations in Geneva.Ms. Karimova also faced investigations in Sweden, Switzerland and the United States over accusations of bribery and money laundering. Within her own country, she is considered a \u201crobber baron,\u201d who would \u201ccrush business people or anyone else who stands in her way,\u201d according to a leaked American diplomatic cable. The United States was able to file charges because the $850 million in suspected bribes passed through the American financial system on the way to accounts in Britain, Hong Kong, Latvia, Luxembourg and other places.Sunshine Uzbekistan, a group of Uzbek human rights activists living in exile, has asked the Justice Department not to repatriate the money but to put it into a trust for use when conditions improve. Repatriating the money before that would mean it \u201cwould disappear,\u201d the group said in a letter to the department. The group argues that a trust fund would provide an incentive for the country to improve its human rights record as a condition of getting the money.\u201cThe Justice Department is the last hope for the Uzbek people,\u201d Sanjar G. Umarov, founder of the coalition, said in an interview.A different set of issues complicates the efforts to return the Abacha money to Nigeria, a case that has dragged on for decades as various people have asserted claims on the money. As the courts have steadily dismissed those claims, the Justice Department has drawn closer to repatriating the money.A group called Serap, which stands for the Socio-Economic Rights Accountability Project, has asked that the money to be given to a \u201creliable U.S. or Nigerian charitable organization\u201d and not returned to the government. \u201cThere is the hope that if the money is placed in the right hands it will be used more efficiently,\u201d said Alexander Sierck, a Washington lawyer and counsel to Serap.Many Nigerians say statements like that, however well intended, smack of colonialism. Instead, they say that the money was theirs in the first place and that the country\u2019s leaders \u2014 and not an outside person or group \u2014 should decide how it is spent. The Nigerian government agrees.This line of argument has become stronger as falling oil prices have hurt the country\u2019s economy and a new president has pledged to eradicate corruption. In May last year at an anticorruption conference in London, Nigeria\u2019s newly elected president, Muhammadu Buhari, said, \u201cWhat I am demanding is the return of the assets.\u201dAn article last Sunday about efforts by the United States government to seize assets from corrupt officials gave an outdated title for Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue of Equatorial Guinea, who has agreed to give up valuables he amassed in the United States. He is now the country\u2019s vice president, no longer the second vice president. (He is the son of the nation\u2019s president, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin Sees a Happy New Year", "Date": "2016-12-26", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorCHICAGO \u2014 These days President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia cannot hide his glee. This is unusual for a man trained to deceive and mislead, a man who is practiced in his profession. In an interview with the Russian television program \u201cWeekly News\u201d on Dec. 4, Mr. Putin said it was obvious that the West had failed to create a unipolar world and that balance was being restored. He had reasons to feel triumphant: His years of supporting anti-establishment movements in the West, mostly on the right, by hacking and leaking private information, spreading fake news and financing parties and individuals ready to do the Kremlin\u2019s bidding all seem to be paying off.Russia\u2019s methods are hardly new. Remember, for example, \u201cThe Protocols of the Elders of the Zion,\u201d a notorious forgery concocted by the czar\u2019s secret police and published in Russia in 1903. Purporting to describe a Jewish plot to dominate the world, it became a bible for anti-Semites everywhere and was widely used by the Nazis. Throughout the 20th century, disinformation and propaganda disseminated by the Communist Party\u2019s Department of Propaganda and Agitation, alongside its intelligence services, became part and parcel of the Soviet regime. During the Soviet-Finnish war in the winter of 1939, for instance, as Soviet planes bombed the Finns, the Soviet foreign minister, Vyacheslav M. Molotov, said Moscow was dropping humanitarian aid \u2014 food and water. In response to the lie, the Finns sarcastically named their own bombs \u2014 bottles filled with flammable fuel \u2014 Molotov cocktails.In post-Soviet Russia, the same cynical mendacity has become the Putin government\u2019s hallmark. On July 9, 2014, in a meeting with public leaders at the Kremlin, Mr. Putin referred to Joseph Goebbels, the notorious Nazi minister of propaganda, as \u201ca talented man who knew that the more incredible the lies, the quicker people believe them.\u201d The quote, which he was using to condemn the West\u2019s supposed misrepresentation of Russian history, was in fact the best indication of Mr. Putin\u2019s own creed.Now, in addition to undermining the legitimacy of the American presidential election campaign, Russia has been a frequent source of fake news that targeted the Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, during a recent referendum and muddled a Swedish debate last summer about joining NATO.Throughout Eastern Europe, Moscow has been implicated in cyberattacks and election interference from Estonia to Bulgaria. Germany, which will hold elections in September, is experiencing cyberattacks and fake news.Even more surprising than Russia\u2019s aggressive behavior has been the timid response of the West, which has let Moscow engage in cyberwarfare with impunity. President Obama said this month that during their meeting last September, he told Mr. Putin \u201cto cut it out.\u201d That hardly sounds like a president concerned with a grave threat to American democracy. His warning to Mr. Putin may have forestalled even more brazen Russian attacks, but enough damage had already been done. In Italy, Mr. Renzi\u2019s campaign privately complained about Russia\u2019s interference but declined to go public. And when Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, was asked on Nov. 27 about Russian meddling in Germany\u2019s electoral campaign, she replied, \u201cWe just have to learn to live with it.\u201dTo live with it? This is not routine cyber intelligence, which many nations practice. Russia\u2019s cyber activity seeks to confuse, destabilize and ultimately bring to power foreign governments pliant to Russia\u2019s aims. That is an attack on the values and institutions of democratic societies, and, if successful, it achieves the same result as a military invasion to install a new government.In his recent interview on Russian television, the Kremlin\u2019s chief propagandist, Dmitri Kiselev, stated it in bald, cynical terms: \u201cToday it is much more costly to kill one enemy soldier than during World War II, World War I or in the Middle Ages,\u201d adding that \u201cif you can persuade a person, you don\u2019t need to kill him.\u201dThe Russian military views an information war as part of its military doctrine, and Americans need to consider Russia\u2019s cyber activities as an act of war that requires a forceful and united response. President Obama\u2019s response \u2014 at least until now \u2014 has proved inadequate.Unlike the Cold War, this one has no Iron Curtain and no ideological battleground. In this new hybrid warfare, former K.G.B. men have become oligarchs, Mr. Putin refers to Western nations as \u201cpartners,\u201d and the government sells stakes in state companies to Western businesses and relies on Western markets and other financial institutions. Yet behind the smoke and mirrors, Russia remains a Potemkin village that hides a police state and an expansionist empire, steeped in systemic corruption and governed by up-to-date techniques of repression and manipulation.This, too, is not new for Russia. Unhindered by public opinion, laws and opposition political parties, Russia\u2019s autocrats have historically derived strength from territorial expansion and geopolitical aggrandizement. Starting with Ivan the Terrible, the Russian empire expanded for at least five centuries \u2014 by some calculations annexing each year territory the size of Belgium \u2014 until the Soviet Union finally collapsed in 1991. That dramatic denouement is what Mr. Putin is desperately trying to reverse, resorting to the same tool kit used by Soviet leaders since the formative days of the Soviet state in the early 1920s. At that time a destitute and hungry Russia was recovering from revolution and civil war. Still, the Bolshevik government spared no resources when it came to propaganda and repression.Mr. Putin\u2019s greatest success has been to help place in the White House a man who shares many of his values and seems happy to do his bidding. But Mr. Putin is not done yet. He seeks to promote anti-establishment candidates in next year\u2019s elections in the Netherlands, France, Italy and Germany. If this new cold war comes to an end with a Putin-Trump alliance, it will do so on Russia\u2019s terms, with Russia no more democratic and the United States becoming a little more like Russia.Next October will mark a century since the Bolsheviks violently seized power. That first totalitarian regime, in which Mr. Putin would later be trained, arguably provoked the rise of other political movements that together defined the rest of the 20th century, leading to unprecedented political violence and wars that took the lives of tens of millions.We simply cannot allow Moscow to define the direction of another century by orchestrating a parade of Western democracies on their way to becoming corrupt, autocratic societies.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Deutsche Bank the Winner in Late Flurry of Mortgage Settlements", "Date": "2016-12-23", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsAlthough Barclays failed to achieve similar closure, settlements with the United States Justice Department by Deutsche, Germany\u2019s largest lender by assets, and its peer Credit Suisse remove major question marks for both banks.If the combined $11.7 billion number for Deutsche and Credit Suisse seems big, the balance sheet hits are less so. That\u2019s because the bulk of the agreements are in the form of loan forgiveness or credit relief rather than hard cash. Remove that element and Deutsche will pay a $3.1 billion penalty; Credit Suisse will pay $2.5 billion. Factor in the fourth-quarter charges that the banks have said they will take after provisions, and Reuters Breakingviews calculates that both will probably have common equity Tier 1 capital as a proportion of risk-weighted assets at an adequate 11.3 percent.Deutsche Bank investors have the most to cheer. When the Justice Department\u2019s initial $14 billion demand was leaked in September, the bank\u2019s shares plunged. The settlement may slightly slow the attempts by its chief executive, John M. Cryan, to return the lender to economic profitability. But it could have been far worse. Had Deutsche Bank\u2019s $7.2 billion total settlement been entirely in the form of cash, its Tier 1 ratio might have fallen below 11 percent, near a threshold set by its main regulator. A $14 billion hit might have pushed it closer to 9 percent and potentially prompted panic among creditors.Barclays\u2019 readiness to fight on rather than resolve its own mortgage misdeeds is partly because it did something similar with foreign exchange settlements, and partly because it has less to lose in taking on the American regulator than Deutsche, which has other sizable litigation outstanding. But mostly the bank appears to believe that a settlement would be unfair. Using figures from the data provider Inside Mortgage Finance, it points out that its $74 billion issuance of residential mortgage-backed securities between 2005 and 2007 was half the size of the smallest dealer among the seven banks that have settled.Nonetheless, Barclays\u2019 own capital ratio could have fallen below 11 percent had it been fined an amount similar to what the Justice Department imposed on Deutsche and Credit Suisse. A bit of ambiguity over the final legal bill may be preferable to the certainty of a big hit to the balance sheet. But it\u2019s still taking a gamble on regulatory leniency in the era of Donald J. Trump.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Plan to Reduce Medicare Drug Costs Is Withdrawn After Bipartisan Criticism", "Date": "2016-12-16", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration said on Thursday that it had scrapped one of its most significant efforts to rein in spending on prescription drugs: a plan for a nationwide experiment in which Medicare would have reduced payments for many drugs given to patients in doctors\u2019 offices and hospital clinics.Federal health officials withdrew the proposal after it was criticized by pharmaceutical companies, doctors, patients and members of Congress from both parties. One of the sharpest critics was Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia, the man chosen by President-elect Donald J. Trump to be his secretary of health and human services.Ben Wakana, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said that, after considering public comments on a proposed rule, the agency had decided not to move forward with the demonstration project, which was announced in March.\u201cThe proposal was intended to test whether alternative drug payment structures would improve the quality of patient care and the value of Medicare drug spending,\u201d Mr. Wakana said. \u201cWhile there was a great deal of support from some, a number of stakeholders expressed strong concerns.\u201dHe added, \u201cThe complexity of the issues and the limited time available led to the decision not to finalize the rule at this time.\u201dDrug costs have again become a hot political issue as the price tag on some medications is now well over $50,000 a year. But the proposal for lowering spending, Obama administration officials said, was killed by the drug industry and its lobbyists.However, the House Democratic leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, welcomed the administration\u2019s decision. The proposal had \u201cadmirable goals,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said, but \u201cour members raised a number of concerns, and we are pleased the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation has decided not to move forward.\u201dShe added, \u201cCongress must come together in a bipartisan way to address the soaring costs of prescription drugs in a way that supports the search for cures while ensuring that patients can afford these treatments.\u201dThe Obama administration says Medicare\u2019s payment formula rewards doctors for prescribing expensive drugs. Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, had proposed a five-year nationwide test to encourage doctors to prescribe less expensive therapies under Part B of Medicare.Patients\u2019 advocates joined doctors and drug companies in warning that the federal plan could jeopardize access to important medications. Every member of the Senate Finance Committee \u2014 14 Republicans and 12 Democrats \u2014 and more than 300 House members expressed concern about the proposal, which could have reduced payments for drugs to treat various types of cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, macular degeneration and other conditions.The lobbying arm of the American Cancer Society said the proposal did not protect patients\u2019 access to lifesaving drugs, but focused more on the potential for cost savings.Allyson Funk, a spokeswoman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade group that lobbied against the proposal, said, \u201cWe are pleased the Part B demonstration, which would have jeopardized access to treatment for millions of patients, will not move forward.\u201dIn its proposal, the Obama administration said it wanted to require \u201cmandatory participation\u201d for doctors and hospitals that provide Part B drugs to Medicare beneficiaries in three-fourths of the nation\u2019s 7,000 \u201cprimary care service areas,\u201d using reimbursement formulas different from those in federal Medicare law.In the Affordable Care Act, Congress gave the health secretary power to waive federal Medicare law to test innovative ways of paying for health care. Representative Brett Guthrie, Republican of Kentucky, said President Obama and Ms. Burwell had gone far beyond what Congress envisioned.Some consumer organizations supported the administration\u2019s proposal. AARP, the lobby for older Americans, said it could have reduced out-of-pocket costs for Medicare beneficiaries. And some Democrats, including Representative Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, voiced support for the project.\u201cWe are actively reforming every other aspect of our health care system to pay for value except pharmaceuticals,\u201d Ms. Schakowsky said in the spring. \u201cDrug manufacturers are the only entity that can charge Medicare anything they want.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sometimes, a Merger Just Doesn\u2019t Pay Off", "Date": "2016-12-21", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsAs the most recent merger boom winds down, the broken promises of overeager corporate executives will begin to emerge in earnest. Contrary to the Wall Street spin, one plus one rarely amounts to more than two. The progress of three transactions from the start of the current cycle illustrates the ways investors will be let down in 2017.Worldwide mergers and acquisitions reached $3.3 trillion through December 2016, according to Thomson Reuters, down 18 percent from the record-setting year that preceded it. The crop includes megadeals like AT&T\u2019s proposed $85 billion takeover of Time Warner and the Abbott Laboratories $25 billion acquisition of St. Jude Medical.Some matches will work out as overlapping businesses generate cost savings that fall to the bottom line. In many cases, however, the market prematurely gave corporate chiefs the benefit of the doubt. Disasters like Time Warner-AOL or Vivendi-Universal, which followed the fin-de-si\u00e8cle surge more than a decade ago, may be avoided, but deals struck in jewelry, artificial limbs and poultry provide a sneak preview.Start with Signet Jewelers. In February 2014, early in the merger bonanza, the diamond merchant bid $1.4 billion for its rival Zales. The projected synergies didn\u2019t materialize, sales disappointed, Signet\u2019s accounting needed revising and a private equity firm was brought in to shore up its finances. Its stock has underperformed the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index since the deal was unveiled, and is down 10 percent since Signet put a ring on Zales.Then there is the medical device maker Zimmer. The $13.4 billion purchase of its rival Biomet in 2014 is, so far, an example of why not doing deals is often preferable. While Zimmer\u2019s shareholders have watched the value of their stock rise by 12 percent since pouncing on Biomet, its competitor Stryker, which sat out the frenzy, has delivered three times more.Lastly, consider Tyson Foods. Since successfully bidding for the sausage maker Hillshire Brands in May 2014, its equity value has expanded by less than the $7.7 billion it handed to Hillshire\u2019s owners. Tyson recently warned that earnings would not meet expectations and parted ways with its chief executive.Signet, Zimmer and Tyson could yet live up to their commitments. In the meantime, expect other big acquirers to join them in failing to make good on their corporate finance calculus.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Health Exchange Enrollment Jumps, Even as G.O.P. Pledges Repeal", "Date": "2016-12-21", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 About 6.4 million people have signed up for health insurance next year under the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration said Wednesday, as people rushed to purchase plans regardless of Republican promises that the law will be repealed within months.The new sign-ups \u2014 an increase of 400,000 over a similar point last year \u2014 mean the health care coverage of millions of consumers could be imperiled by one of the first legislative actions of Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidency. Hundreds of thousands of other people who took no action will be automatically re-enrolled by the federal government in the same or similar plans, officials said, and their coverage could be threatened as well. Consumers still have until the end of January to enroll.Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, said the number of sign-ups was remarkable in view of \u201cheadwinds\u201d created by premium increases for 2017 and by the uncertainty of the entire health law after Mr. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.Americans remain divided over President Obama\u2019s most significant legislative achievement, even as 20 million people have gained coverage under the law and the percentage of those without insurance has dropped to record lows. Mr. Trump and Republican leaders of the House and the Senate have vowed to repeal the 2010 law as one of the first legislative actions of the Trump era.To lay the political groundwork, Republicans have portrayed the law as collapsing under its own weight, unable to hold down health costs or provide the insurance choices its advocates promised.But the 6.4 million signing up on HealthCare.gov through Monday could undermine the argument that the law is in free fall. The five states with the most people enrolling for coverage on the site through Monday were Florida, with 1.3 million plan selections, Texas (776,000), North Carolina (369,000), Georgia (352,000) and Pennsylvania (291,000). Mr. Trump carried all those states.And the 6.4 million figure does not include data from states like New York and California that use their own digital marketplaces.Democrats say that repealing the law will cause chaos and catastrophe, jeopardizing coverage for people who use HealthCare.gov and millions more who have been able to enroll in Medicaid. Whether those consumers like their coverage enough to fight for it and to resist Republican efforts to undo the law is unclear. But the enrollment figures will provide a rallying cry for Democrats intent on saving it.\u201cEnrollment is running ahead of last year,\u201d Ms. Burwell said. \u201cToday\u2019s enrollment numbers confirm that doomsday predictions about the marketplace are wrong.\u201dFor their part, Republicans reiterated their concerns.\u201cThis disaster of a law has led to massive premium spikes, less choice for patients and a collapse of the exchange markets, and no amount of spinning from the White House can hide this ugly reality,\u201d AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, said Wednesday.Peeling away pieces of the law could lead to market chaos.The Trump team tried to allay concerns by promising a smooth transition to a new version of health care coverage, echoing congressional Republicans, who have floated the idea of quickly repealing the law and then delaying the effective date for several years as they try to agree on a different approach to the nation\u2019s health care problems.\u201cThe enrollment numbers announced today show just how important health care coverage is to millions of Americans,\u201d said Phillip J. Blando, a spokesman for the Trump transition team. \u201cThe Trump administration will work closely with Congress, governors, patients, doctors and other stakeholders to fix the Affordable Care Act\u2019s well-documented flaws and provide consumers with stable and predictable health plan choices.\u201dA number of Republican governors, including Vice President-elect Mike Pence of Indiana, supported the expansion of Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act, and some have expressed reservations about Republican plans to repeal that part of the law.Some Republican senators have expressed similar reservations.Thomas P. Miller, a health economist at the American Enterprise Institute and a harsh critic of the health law, predicted that the new numbers would have \u201ca negligible effect\u201d on the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress. \u201cThe Obama administration gets an A for effort in marketing puffery,\u201d he said, \u201cbut remains stuck with a C for execution.\u201dSenator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and chairman of the Finance Committee, was similarly unimpressed. \u201cInitial enrollment numbers for the health law have long been flawed, as they do not account for consumers who actually follow through and pay the premiums,\u201d he said. \u201cA closer look will be needed down the road to determine the final, real enrollment numbers.\u201dBut consumers are becoming concerned, administration officials say. Ms. Burwell said the federal call center had \u201cheard from more than 30,000 people worrying about the future of their coverage in the wake of the election, and wondering whether they should still sign up for a 2017 plan.\u201dThe answer, she said, is a definite yes.Some people might have been rushing to sign up because they were concerned about losing coverage they had gained under the health law, acknowledged Andrew M. Slavitt, the acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. A larger factor, he said, is that people need coverage and are finding it affordable.Most consumers shopping in the public marketplace can find coverage for less than $75 a month after receiving subsidies, the administration said. But to find such bargains, consumers may have to switch plans and change doctors, officials said.Last Thursday alone, Ms. Burwell said, 670,000 people enrolled, setting a record.Monday was the deadline for people to sign up for coverage starting Jan. 1. The open enrollment period, which began on Nov. 1, ends on Jan. 31, 11 days after Mr. Trump takes office.The Obama administration predicted in October that 13.8 million people would sign up for coverage or be automatically re-enrolled through the federal and state marketplaces by the end of January, and Ms. Burwell said Wednesday that she stood by that prediction.In the past week, Obama administration officials have tried to lock in place their health policies by issuing a batch of final rules before Mr. Trump takes office.One rule, the annual \u201cnotice of benefit and payment parameters,\u201d includes detailed standards for plan benefits, eligibility and enrollment under the Affordable Care Act. Most of the new standards apply to insurance sold in 2018. Some apply to 2019, a sign that the administration hopes the law will still be in place well into the Trump administration.Because of an editing error, an article on Thursday about sign-ups for insurance under the Affordable Care Act referred incorrectly to a letter obtained by Politico and addressed to Republicans in Congress. Gov. Susana Martinez of New Mexico did not authorize or send the letter, which was drafted for her consideration by the staff of the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, an independent public corporation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Grandiose Ideas for Donald Trump Inaugural Give Way to Traditional", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byPresident-elect Donald J. Trump kicked around ideas for his inauguration in his office at Trump Tower on Tuesday with two of his oldest friends, Mark Burnett and Thomas Barrack Jr.The ideas spilled out from Mr. Burnett, a well-regarded showman best known for producing \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d: a parade up Fifth Avenue, a helicopter ride to Washington from New York that could hold the attention of millions of people expected to watch from around the world.Mr. Trump recalled the conversation Wednesday morning to an audience of donors, lobbyists and supporters at Cipriani 42nd Street during a fund-raiser to help support his transition operation.The details offered a brief glimmer of a sprawling inauguration, full of the kind of showmanship for which Mr. Trump is famous, that could shake up what has become a relatively predictable affair for recent presidents. According to some of the people overseeing the events surrounding Mr. Trump\u2019s swearing-in as the 45th president, they also bore little resemblance to reality.In fact, they said, Mr. Trump\u2019s celebration would be a relatively subdued affair \u2014 marked by Mr. Trump\u2019s own touches, to be sure, but in the mold of past affairs.\u201cIt\u2019s going the opposite way,\u201d Mr. Barrack, the private equity investor who is leading the presidential inaugural committee, said in an interview. \u201cThe president-elect wants this to be simple. He wants this to be about the people.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not about putting on the most expensive talent and spending that kind of money to ingratiate himself,\u201d Mr. Barrack added.In many ways, the discussion between the three men in Mr. Trump\u2019s office tower encapsulates the dueling impulses of the president-elect, a man who enjoys being at the center of attention, but who is also aware that he was elected on a strong populist message of \u201cdraining the swamp\u201d of Washington cronyism and extravagance.In reality, Mr. Trump\u2019s festivities are constrained by security concerns surrounding the modern presidency, making some gaudier displays impossible and other far-flung ones unrealistic. Each event under consideration must be vetted by the overlapping agencies responsible for securing the transfer of power, including the Secret Service, responsible for a president\u2019s security, and the National Park Service, which controls the Mall in Washington.\u201cYou have five gigantic security groups that dictate what can and can\u2019t be done,\u201d Mr. Barrack said.For example, Mr. Barrack said that hopes to open the White House to visitors, as Andrew Jackson did during his 1829 \u201cPeople\u2019s Inauguration\u201d (and as other presidents did afterward), had simply proven unrealistic.\u201cUnfortunately, security concerns are different than they were in 1829,\u201d he said.Despite the modest nature of the events under consideration, Mr. Barrack said Mr. Burnett was actively involved in producing the inauguration week festivities. He will have a large team to work with, as the committee\u2019s staff in Washington is expected to swell to more than 300 people by Inauguration Day.\u201cMark is a genius, and the president-elect loves him,\u201d Mr. Barrack said. Referring to the Tuesday meeting, he said, \u201cThis was about throwing stuff out if you are thinking in the frame of mind of what a global audience would see.\u201dIt will include an opening \u201cvictory reception\u201d for donors, as well as a series of more personal events with the incoming first family, Vice President-elect Mike Pence and members of Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet. Donors will be invited to candlelight dinners on the eve of the inauguration, and some will be able to attend one of two official balls planned for inauguration night.Whatever Mr. Trump and the committee ultimately decide, there likely will be plenty of resources at their disposal. Mr. Trump\u2019s fund-raising team has already secured roughly $50 million in pledged donations since it began soliciting money in earnest last week, according to two people involved in the effort.The early success puts Mr. Trump in line to easily surpass President Obama\u2019s 2009 inauguration, when his finance team raised a record $53 million to pay for the festivities. He should also easily meet or surpass the $65 million to $75 million fund-raising goal set by the committee.Those raising money to support the inauguration said they have seen a similar pattern, securing early pledges from prominent Republican donors who did not support Mr. Trump during the campaign. Corporations, they said, have also been forthcoming.Yet, if Mr. Trump is looking forward to his presidency, he has not yet left the past behind, as was clear Wednesday morning.Another person at the fund-raiser said Mr. Trump delivered a kind of greatest-hits recollection of winning the primaries and his grim odds for the White House. Mr. Trump said that heading into Election Day, he and his wife, Melania, had planned a vacation in the expectation that they would be seeing an early night.He recalled Mr. Obama telling him privately that the president\u2019s advisers had told him on election night, as the numbers looked grim, that North Carolina would be a firewall for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee.The attendance at the fund-raiser spoke to Mr. Trump\u2019s change of fortune since becoming president-elect. There were at least 850 people in the restaurant. Mr. Trump singled out those in attendance who had been part of the \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement, drawing a large laugh.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Legal Financing Rivals to Combine in $160 Million Deal", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "Supported byBurford Capital, which finances litigation for corporations and law firms, is acquiring its Chicago-based rival, Gerchen Keller Capital, in a $160 million deal.The combined firms have $1.2 billion in investments and commitments in the growing field of outside financing for litigation.Law firms are turning more frequently to outside sources, according to a Burford survey of firms and in-house corporate counsel released in May. Partnership structures at law firms hinder investment in longer-term litigation, which can require costly improvements in technology or data security. Corporations trying to handle large-scale litigation are also hamstrung by tighter budgets, the general counsels said in the survey.To gain more financial flexibility, law firms have been using outside lenders. Last year, Burford committed $30 million to the Hausfeld law firm to expand its presence in Germany, for example. Burford, based in New York, also said early this year that it was committing $100 million in financing for a group of cases at a large, unnamed law firm. Typically, law firms are private entities and disclose little about their financing arrangements.Burford was founded in 2009 by Christopher P. Bogart, its chief executive, who is a lawyer and a former general counsel for Time Warner. The company reported revenue last year of $103 million, up from $82 million in 2014, with pretax profit of $67 million.Gerchen Keller, a registered investment adviser, has $1.3 billion in assets raised from public pensions, financial institutions, university endowments, foundations and family wealth offices. Among its financing efforts is a major case in Britain challenging MasterCard fees.This year, Gerchen Keller\u2019s estimated income was $15.4 million and its operating profit, before one-time transactional expenses, was $9.1 million. The deal to acquire the firm is said to be a merger of cash, shares in Burford and loan notes, and the combined resources and expertise will help the resulting entity broaden its lending activity, which has largely been confined to the United States.Other lenders in the field provide financing to law firms to allow them to offer clients alternatives to the traditional, more restrictive hourly billing model, such as contingency financing. Law firms typically have had lower long-term investment in infrastructure because compensation for partners is tied to current profitability, providing an incentive to limit such investment.An earlier version of this article misstated the service provided by Grant Thornton, a professional services firm. The company offers audit, tax and advisory services; it does not provide litigation financing to law firms.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "$100 Million Deal to Save Pier 40 in Manhattan Is Approved", "Date": "2016-12-15", "News": "Supported byIt\u2019s a twofer.In return, the developer \u2014 a joint venture of Atlas Capital Group and Westbrook Partners \u2014 obtained approvals for a vast, five-tower residential complex with retail and possibly a hotel on the site of St. John\u2019s Terminal, which stretches more than three blocks along Washington Street between West Houston and Spring Streets on the Lower West Side of Manhattan.The air rights, which are being transferred from Pier 40, enable the developer to build a larger complex, which is planned to include office space and 1,586 apartments, 30 percent of them reserved for low- and middle-income tenants.During negotiations with the city, elected officials and residents, the developer agreed to dedicate one building to older tenants, to reduce the number of parking spaces at the complex, to emphasize local retailers rather than big box stores and to create a 15,000-square-foot public recreation center.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long and difficult road,\u201d said City Councilman Corey Johnson, a Democrat, who represents the area and was involved in wringing concessions from the developer. \u201cBut in the end, the project got better and better at each phase. I\u2019m not sure we would\u2019ve gotten all the affordable housing if it hadn\u2019t gone through a public review.\u201dEarly this week, the developers put $100 million into an escrow account for the air rights from Pier 40, a doughnut-shaped, two-story structure with community soccer fields in the center ringed by parking lots. The money will be released for work on the pier next year when the deal closes.\u201cIt\u2019s a big moment for the park,\u201d said Madelyn Wils, chief executive of the trust. \u201cIt ensures that the pier will stay open. It doesn\u2019t come a moment too soon.\u201dThe city also agreed to provide the trust with up to $14.1 million for other repairs to the pier.The trust approved the deal at a board meeting on Thursday afternoon. After the repairs are finished, the trust wants to erect a commercial building on the pier that would generate revenue for the park, while retaining the soccer fields.But that does not mean that the St. John\u2019s Terminal will soon be demolished to make way for new residential towers. The market for condominiums and high-end apartments has slowed over the last year. Lenders are now cautious about financing construction projects given the plethora of new residential buildings in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens.The developer may renovate the existing building for office tenants until the market picks up again. The five buildings will eventually be built in phases. But Atlas and Westbrook say they are in for the long haul.\u201cSt. John\u2019s Terminal will be transformed into a vibrant mixed-use development that adds affordable housing to the district and improved light and visibility for West Side residents,\u201d Paul D. Kazilionis, chief executive of Westbrook, said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cWe are grateful for the collaboration.\u201dIn approving the St. John\u2019s project, the City Council prohibited the Hudson River Park Trust from transferring any additional air rights to sites in the adjoining neighborhood, said Mr. Johnson, the councilman.The St. John\u2019s project has been four years in the making and nearly fell apart on more than one occasion. Some people opposed the sale and transfer of 200,000 square feet of air rights from the pier, fearing it would set a precedent for a new generation of towers along the waterfront.But City Hall and elected officials, including Assemblyman Richard N.

{"Headline": "The Conquerers: A New 19th-Century History Focuses on American Imperialism", "Date": "2016-12-16", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.\u201cI take space to be the central fact to man born in America, from Folsom cave to now,\u201d the great poet Charles Olson wrote in his study of Herman Melville. \u201cI spell it large because it comes large here. Large, and without mercy.\u201d In one way or another, historians of 19th-century America have long grappled with the way space \u2014 whether defined as property, geography or Emersonian nature \u2014 has seized the imagination, and lined the pocketbooks, of slaveholders, colonialists and capitalists.In his comprehensive \u201cA Nation Without Borders: The United States and Its World in an Age of Civil Wars, 1830-1910,\u201d Steven Hahn is no exception, although he provides the most sweeping indictment to date of the American appetite for conquest. A professor of history at New York University and winner of a Pulitzer Prize for \u201cA Nation Under Our Feet: Black Political Struggles in the Rural South From Slavery to the Great Migration,\u201d Hahn argues that America developed into a nation precisely because of its obsession with owning space; that is, it sought to become a continental empire, which meant acquiring land and resources, almost at any cost, and dominating sovereign peoples both at home and abroad.Hahn tellingly opens his chronicle of greed on the Texas border. After Gen. Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna failed to crush insurgent Texians (Americans in Tejas), the slaveholding Republic of Texas was shakily established, and though many Texians hoped their republic would be annexed by the United States, neither Mexico nor the United States officially recognized it. What\u2019s more, the Texas border was itself in dispute and as a result, Hahn observes, Texas remained more of \u201can imagined space than a sovereign state, with boundaries that were endlessly porous, ever shifting and almost impossible to discern.\u201dThese porous borders supply Hahn with his central metaphor. Nations possess recognized boundaries, principles and laws over which a central government directly rules. To become a nation, America colonized those peoples who lived within its borders and exacted a high price whenever they tried to retain their cultural or religious traditions. (Consider the federal treatment of Native American tribes.) Yet to Hahn the United States is also an imperialist nation without borders, seeking to expand, to assimilate, to annex or to conquer other nations, sovereignties or peoples, not just in the Western Hemisphere but also in the Pacific. (Consider the American wars against Filipinos as well as Mexicans and Cubans.)In the years after the War of the Rebellion (Hahn avoids the term \u201cCivil War\u201d), the United States became a nation-state as the Army, the states, the courts and Congress built up a vast network of railroads that helped keep labor, as Hahn puts it, \u201cunder their thumbs.\u201d Hahn thus considers the postwar period commonly known as Reconstruction not just as the rocky, often violent conversion of slave into free labor but as the beginning of \u201cnation-state formation,\u201d buttressed by a judiciary that provided capitalism, as he says, with \u201creal traction\u201d in the post-bellum West and South. Most important, philosophical concepts such as individualism or, later, Herbert Spencer\u2019s notion of \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d undercut the revolutionary implications of Radical Republicanism. Everyone fending for himself eroded federally mandated civil and political rights, not to mention that scary idea about redistributing Confederate lands to former slaves.Hahn describes how the American nation colonized native peoples within its own borders by deploying military and paramilitary groups \u2014 hired guns and organized lynch parties \u2014 to defeat the \u201coppositional movements\u201d he admires. Of course, in the first half of the 19th century there had been a host of rebellions against federal authority: whether the defiance of native peoples during the Second Seminole War or the attempt of the Mormons to organize their own state in the Utah Territory.But in the years after the War of the Rebellion, and during the Progressive Era, which Hahn labels a period of \u201creconstructions,\u201d a number of \u201cworker mobilizations\u201d challenged capitalist gluttony, federal domination of the Western territories and corporate consolidation. Committed to restoring human dignity to lives and jobs, this array of dissident groups \u2014 and certain individuals within them \u2014 resisted the monopolistic practices of railroads, of industrial capitalism and of corporate behemoths like Standard Oil. They included the \u201cpan-tribal Indianness\u201d that expressed itself in the Ghost Dance movement and the Greenback Labor Party, which hoped to limit the power of financiers. The biracial Knights of Labor called for an eight-hour workday, currency reform and the nationalization of the railroads and utilities. Influencing many of these movements was the point of view of the new European immigrants, many of whom were socialists \u2014 and the inspiration of the short-lived Paris Commune.Hahn goes on to address such topics as Populism; Frederick Winslow Taylor\u2019s theory of scientific management; settlement houses; woman suffrage; and the Supreme Court decisions known as the Insular Cases, which left the people of such annexed territories as Guam and Puerto Rico without full United States citizenship. His assessments are cogent but quick. That is the downside of an ambitious single volume that spans 80 years of nettlesome history and runs to over 500 pages, including an indispensable 50-page bibliography, primarily of secondary sources. (The book is part of the Penguin History of the United States, edited by Eric Foner.) Since he covers so much ground, Hahn helpfully subdivides his chapters into sections with titles like \u201cImperial Eyes,\u201d \u201cLabor\u2019s Coercions,\u201d \u201cThe Blood of Continental Destiny,\u201d \u201cMilitant Arms of Slaveholding Empire,\u201d \u201cThe Jacobin Arm and Peasant Dream,\u201d \u201cWheels of Capital,\u201d \u201cThreads of Discourse\u201d and \u201cImperial Reconstruction\u201d \u2014 titles that indicate his point of view.Although he generally addresses an academic audience comfortable with terms like \u201cdiscursive process,\u201d \u201cgender exclusions,\u201d \u201cthe vectors of politics,\u201d \u201ccircuits of finance capital,\u201d \u201cimperial arms\u201d and the \u201ccultural arms of the colonizers,\u201d Hahn seems to be targeting a nonspecialist readership as well. He frequently uses phrases like \u201csent packing,\u201d \u201cswallowed the bitter pill,\u201d \u201cposter boy,\u201d \u201cthrew in the towel\u201d and \u201clower the boom.\u201d There\u2019s quite a bit of unraveling too: \u201cSlavery unraveled,\u201d the \u201ccrop economy had unraveled\u201d and then, with the Haymarket bombing in 1886, the American labor movement for a time \u201cunraveled.\u201dIn these later chapters, Hahn\u2019s beguiling border metaphor all but disappears until he reminds us that by the first decade of the 20th century, \u201cthe borders of American nationhood were well secured while the borders of American power remained limitless.\u201d Despite this elegant formulation, so well documented in the preceding pages, there is a slippery, self-annulling quality to it. Borders imply restrictions, and restrictions are very difficult for certain groups, like women, to overcome; but slaves and free people of color can, according to Hahn, sometimes cross \u201cthe apparent borders of enslavement\u201d to win public support. One would have thought the borders of enslavement pretty stiff, especially since the arguments for and against their extension had been so violent and unending. At the same time, Hahn notes, \u201cno borders to slavery could be erected,\u201d particularly after the Supreme Court\u2019s Dred Scott decision, which declared Scott a slave even though he had resided in a free state and territory. So borders can be boundaries, boundaries can be transgressed, or not; borders confine people, but the absence of borders is not freedom.Borders or no, America in the 19th and early 20th centuries comes across as relentlessly imperialist, which to Hahn means a nation formed in acquisition and conquest, large and without mercy \u2014 and whose mission, fortunately for all of us, often fails.Brenda Wineapple is the author, most recently, of \u201cEcstatic Nation: Confidence, Crisis, and Compromise.\u201d She is writing a book about the impeachment of Andrew Johnson.

{"Headline": "The Rage of 2016", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byNEW YORK \u2014 The long wave unfurled at last. Perhaps it is no surprise that the two societies that felt its furious force \u2014 the United States and Britain \u2014 are also the open societies at the hub of globalized turbo-capitalism and finance. For at least a decade, accelerating since the crash of 2008, fears and resentments had been building over the impunity of elites, the dizzying disruption of technology, the influx of migrants and the precariousness of modern existence.In Western societies, for too long, there had been no victories, no glory and diminishing certainties. Wars were waged; nobody knew how they could be won. Their wounds festered. The distance between metropolis and periphery grew into a cultural chasm. Many things became unsayable; even gender became debatable. Truth blurred, then was sidelined, in an online tribal cacophony.Jobs went. Inequality thrust itself in your face. What the powerful said and the lives people lived were so unrelated that politics looked increasingly like a big heist. Debacle followed debacle \u2014 the euro, the Iraq War, the Great Recession \u2014 and their architects never paid. Syria encapsulated the West\u2019s newfound impotence, a kind of seeping amorality; and, in its bloody dismemberment, Syria sent into Europe a human tide that rabble-rousers seized upon.And so the British voted to quit the European Union, symbol of a continent\u2019s triumph over fascism and destructive nationalism. Americans voted on Nov. 8 for Donald J. Trump, who used much of the xenophobic, fear-mongering language of 1930s Europe to assemble an angry mob large enough that he triumphed over a compromised Hillary Clinton. Neither victory was large, but democracies can usher in radical change by the narrowest of margins. To give the Republican president-elect his due, he intuited an immense disquiet and spoke to it in unambiguous language.A quarter-century after the post-Cold War zenith of liberal democracies and neoliberal economics, illiberalism and authoritarianism are on the march. It\u2019s open season for anyone\u2019s inner bigot. Violence is in the air, awaiting a spark. The winning political card today, as Mr. Trump has shown and Marine Le Pen may demonstrate in the French presidential election next year, is to lead \u201cthe people\u201d against a \u201crigged system,\u201d Muslim migration and the tyrannical consensus of overpaid experts. The postwar order \u2014 its military alliances, trade pacts, political integration and legal framework \u2014 feels flimsy, and the nature of the American power undergirding it all is suddenly unclear. Nobody excites Mr. Trump as much as Russia\u2019s Vladimir V. Putin, who is to democracy what a sledgehammer is to a Ming vase. Strongmen and autocrats everywhere \u2014 not least in Egypt and the Gulf states \u2014 are exulting at Mr. Trump\u2019s victory.It is too early to say what Mr. Trump will do and how many of his wild campaign promises he will keep, but it\u2019s safe to predict turbulence. Irascibility, impetuosity and inattention define him, however curtailed they may prove to be by his entourage and the responsibilities of power. He is, for now, in over his head.NATO will grow weaker. Baltic States will feel more vulnerable. Syria\u2019s Bashar al-Assad, backed by a Putin-Trump entente, will grow stronger. Chinese-American trade tensions will sharpen, in approximate sync with military tensions in the East and South China seas. The Iran nuclear deal, painstakingly negotiated by the major powers, could unravel, making the Middle East exponentially more dangerous. Any jihadi attack or other assault on America will not be met with restraint; Mr. Trump seems to regard nukes as an underused asset.Fossil fuels will make a comeback. The world\u2019s Paris-enshrined commitment to fight climate change will be undermined. The approximately 65 million migrants on the move, about one-third of them refugees, will find shelter and dignity scarce as xenophobic nationalism moves into the political mainstream across Central Europe and elsewhere. Technology\u2019s implacable advance, and the great strides being made by artificial intelligence, will test Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to bring manufacturing jobs back to America. Some forms of employment are gone forever, and not even a self-styled savior can conjure their return. The Trans-Pacific Partnership already looks dead; other trade deals, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, which symbolized the ever-more-open trading system of past decades, could be nixed or substantially diluted.Will all this assuage the people\u2019s ire? Perhaps Mr. Trump really does have some fairy dust he can scatter for a while. But of course \u201cthe people\u201d were only part of a divided population, millions and millions of whom did not want \u2014 and will resist \u2014 the global nationalist and authoritarian lurch. They will do so on the streets, in the courts, via the press and through the checks and balances the framers of the Constitution created precisely to rein in a demagogue. Still, Mr. Trump has enormous powers, a Republican-controlled Congress and a mission to make America great again, whatever that means or takes.The struggle to preserve liberalism will be long. It may well be led now by the likes of Angela Merkel in Germany and Justin Trudeau in Canada. The mantle of custodian of the well-being of the free world sounds like a rip-off to Mr. Trump, who thinks deals and little else. It could well be that America has passed the torch.Western democracies are in the midst of an upheaval they only dimly grasp. Virtual direct democracy through social media has outflanked representative democracy. The impact of the smartphone on the human psyche is as yet scarcely understood; its addictiveness is treacherous and can be the enemy of thought. Mr. Trump hijacked the Republican Party like a man borrowing a dinner jacket for an evening. His campaign moved through Twitter to the aroused masses; it had no use or need for conventional channels. The major political parties in Britain and the United States will have to prove their relevance again.Democracies, it is clear, have not been delivering to the less privileged, who were disenfranchised or discarded in the swirl of technology\u2019s advance. A lot of thought is now needed to find ways to restore faith in liberal, free-market societies; to show that they can be fairer and more equitable and offer more opportunities across the social spectrum. Germany, with its successful balance of capitalism and solidarity, its respect for the labor force and its commitments to both higher education and technical training, offers one model. The rage of 2016 will not abate by itself.The liberal elites\u2019 arrogance and ignorance has been astounding. It is time to listen to the people who voted for change, be humble and think again. That, of course, does not mean succumbing to the hatemongers and racists among them: They must be fought every inch of the way. Nor does it mean succumbing to a post-truth society: Facts are the linchpins of progress. But so brutal a comeuppance cannot be met by more of the same.

They may like that Mr. Trump is taking a more aggressive stance toward Beijing on issues like trade, Taiwan and the South China Sea, but there are also risks for Japan if that stance triggers a hostile response.Perhaps an even bigger disappointment for Mr. Abe is Mr. Trump\u2019s vow to pull the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, on which both Mr. Abe and Mr. Obama spent considerable political capital.For Mr. Abe, it was in part an excuse to push for changes in Japan\u2019s agricultural industry, as well as an opportunity to gain tariff-free access for Japanese manufacturers to export markets in the United States and elsewhere. Now his only hope is to try to persuade Mr. Trump to resuscitate the deal. Mr. Abe briefly met Mr. Trump in New York in November, and he hopes to see Mr. Trump again in Washington shortly after the inauguration.But the alliance with the United States remains the bedrock of Japan\u2019s security, and none of its leaders are currently considering any other significant alternative. Given that, Mr. Abe and other Japanese officials will work hard to persuade Mr. Trump to maintain a strong partnership.Some analysts said that may be a matter of education as much as anything else. \u201cWe are not sure that he knows the concrete measures or details of U.S.-Japan security relations,\u201d said Fumiaki Kubo, a professor of political science at the University of Tokyo, speaking of Mr. Trump.\u201cWhat Prime Minister Abe has to do is give him Lesson 101 on U.S.-Japan relations,\u201d Mr. Kubo said.Advertisement"}

If the restoration work meets government standards, however, MCR will be eligible for a credit against federal and state income taxes of an amount up to 20 percent of qualifying construction costs.As Grand Central Terminal still conjures the majesty of transcontinental train service in a commuter rail age, the Trans World Flight Center continues to evoke the romance of air travel.

{"Headline": "Italy Just Handed the Global Economy Another Giant Variable", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byGlobal markets were not lacking in precarious unknowns. Italy just added another.As voters on Sunday emphatically rejected constitutional changes aimed at streamlining government and making it easier to revive a moribund economy, they enhanced concerns that Italy\u2019s banks could spiral into a disaster. They reinvigorated worries about the endurance of the euro currency and broader European economic integration. And they amplified the sense that Europe is a land of disappointing growth, political dysfunction and seething populism.\u201cExistential crisis\u201d had not been on the ballot, but that was essentially the result. The lopsided tally against the reforms \u2014 nearly 60 percent rejected them \u2014 prompted the resignation of Italy\u2019s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, leaving Europe\u2019s fourth-largest economy without clear leadership.Investors initially pushed down the euro before it recovered. They cut the price of Italian government bonds, lifting the yield \u2014 a sign that investors will demand greater reward for the heightened risks of lending to Italy. Investors also unloaded Spanish and Portuguese government bonds.The widening spread between lower-yielding German bonds and those issued by debt-saturated European countries amounts to a flashing indicator that investors see risks for the southern periphery. These market moves were muted because the results had been anticipated.Indeed, for Europe and the rest of the world, this dynamic was uncomfortably familiar. For nearly a decade, the 19 nations sharing the euro have lurched from one crisis to the next, with no effective fix. A currency designed to unite the adversaries of World War II has instead generated fresh divisions \u2014 between creditor and borrower; Northern Europe and the Mediterranean.In a year in which Britain voted to abandon the European Union and the American electorate selected Donald J. Trump as the next president, Italy offered its own contribution to the global populist insurrection. Against this backdrop, the basic contours of the world economy are now uncertain.Even that possibility threatens Europe with trouble. If investors worry that Italy may leave the euro, they will demand greater rewards for continued lending. Those with the greatest debt burdens \u2014 Greece, Spain and Portugal \u2014 could see their borrowing costs rise beyond their ability to pay.For now, such grim scenarios appear remote. The referendum maintains the power of the Italian legislature\u2019s upper chamber, a potent check on the Five Star Movement, or any government pursuing radical change.The most immediate consequences fall on the Italian banking system, now choked with some 360 billion euro, or about $385 billion, in suspect debts.Mr. Renzi tried and failed to inject public funds into Monte dei Paschi, the perpetual locus of fears about an Italian-bred financial conflagration. The European Union, led by Germany, effectively forbade that step, citing new rules barring taxpayer bailouts to limit the temptation of bankers to engage in reckless lending.Mr. Renzi instead forged a plan that has Monte dei Paschi scrambling to secure \u20ac5 billion from private investors.\u201cFor Monte dei Paschi, it\u2019s going to be extremely hard to close the capital raise by end of the year,\u201d said Nicola Borri, a finance professor at Luiss Guido Carli University in Rome. \u201cThe political future is so uncertain.\u201dMost experts assume a caretaker Italian government will wind up seeking permission from European authorities for some form of a taxpayer-financed rescue of Monte dei Paschi, while agreeing to wipe out the investments of a thin slice of bondholders.The consensus is that Italy can patch immediate holes in the banking system. But the referendum has destroyed what momentum existed to address the condition that is both cause and effect of the banking problem \u2014 a dire lack of economic growth.Mr. Renzi pursued reforms aimed at spurring companies to invest. He made it easier for companies to terminate low-performing workers to eliminate a chief impediment to hiring them in the first place \u2014 the fear that giving someone a job was akin to adopting them as a dependent forever.He sought to speed civil processes in the notoriously inefficient court system to make it easier for banks to recoup bad debts by collecting collateral.The constitutional changes he sought were aimed at clearing another blockage to reform. They would have trimmed the powers of the upper chamber of the legislature, a place where proposals die.Voters clearly did not trust Mr. Renzi to wield greater power. Now, they will be represented by someone with less power where it matters a great deal: Brussels and Berlin.Debt-saturated nations in Europe have long argued that their burdens would be lighter if they could spend more money to spur faster economic growth.But the European Union \u2014 anchored by Germany \u2014 has cited rules limiting the spending of member governments with big debts. Instead, Brussels and Berlin argue, such countries must deliver so-called structural reforms, stripping away labor protections and trimming pension benefits.In a testament to the severity of this creed, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble effectively threatened to banish Greece from the euro if Athens did not deliver on reforms it promised as a condition of successive European bailouts.Mr. Renzi was a rare leader who carried credibility in such quarters. He gained modest relief from European spending strictures in part by pointing at his reforms.\u201cRenzi is the only leader in recent history who has advanced a structural reform agenda,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at the Eurasia Group, a risk consultancy.Now, Mr. Renzi is gone, along with his reform trajectory. What is most palpably still here is an Italian economy that is growing anemically, soon to be presided over by a caretaker government with a limited mandate.\u201cWhat chance does a less effective prime minister overseeing a caretaker government have of getting a hearing in Brussels and Berlin?\u201d Mr. Rahman said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not possible.\u201dItaly has no fuel for growth. It has no clear way to extricate itself \u2014 or the other parts of the planet connected to money \u2014 from the perils of its grinding banking crisis. And the one reinforces the other.Advertisement"}

Seeking to escape the daily routine of his finance job and other adult responsibilities, Smith sought to recreate the feeling he got from the hands-on work he loved as a child by building a wooden canoe. After spending \u201ca million\u201d hours working on the project, he had accomplished his goal \u2014 and kick-started a new career path in the process. He combined his love of woodworking with his passion for surfing and paddleboarding to launch Jarvis Boards, which handcrafts boards from sustainably harvested wood and reclaimed materials. These days, he spends his days living his company motto: \u201cBelieving in American craftsmanship, living conscientiously and traveling adventurously.\u201dThe first time Suchanan Aksornnan cooked in a kitchen she was 5 years old, living in Thailand with her grandmother and aunt. The dish was scrambled eggs, and though she wasn\u2019t allowed to touch the hot stove or sharp knives, she still remembers feeling proud: \u201cI seasoned it myself.\u201dNearly 25 years later, Aksornnan \u2014 now a professional chef in New York City \u2014 cracks an egg over a sizzling wok. As flames lick the underside of the pan, she deftly prepares a Pad Thai with rice noodles, fresh bean sprouts and scallions. After decades of practice, her sense of seasoning has reached plusquamperfection. Barely glancing down, she adds a few more touches to the searing noodles \u2014 a splash of tamarind fish sauce, a dash of palm sugar, a spot of rice vinegar.While Pad Thai is a very traditional dish in her home country, Aksornnan\u2019s overarching style of cooking is an eclectic fusion of Chinese, Japanese, Malaysian, Taiwanese and Thai, as well as Mexican, Spanish and French. \u201cI like to think outside the box and be more creative,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s why everything I do is a fusion thing.\u201dBut the path to her professional culinary career wasn\u2019t simple.

The very next morning, she woke up to her mom knocking on her door, telling her it was time to go to work at her restaurant. \u201cI was still jet-lagged,\u201d she says. She soon enrolled in language school while working part-time, but adjusting to life with her mom in America after being raised by her relatives in Thailand for so many years was challenging.\u201cWe love each other, of course,\u201d says Aksornnan, now 29. \u201cMy mom is my idol. She came [to New York] when she was young also, and now she owns five restaurants. But it got to the point that I needed to get more outside experience.\u201dA few months after arriving in Brooklyn, she quit working for her mother and started looking for new opportunities. She walked the streets each day, searching for a restaurant, until one afternoon in downtown Manhattan, she saw someone in classic chef whites standing outside a trendy hotel restaurant helmed by a world-renowned chef. Peering into the restaurant, she thought, \u201cWow, I would love to work in that kind of kitchen.\u201dShe had no idea what a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 was and barely spoke English, but when she met with the sous chef, she told him she was willing to learn and do whatever job they wanted, even if it meant washing dishes. She was hired, and immediately began to learn some harsh realities.\u201cIn Thai kitchens, everybody\u2019s friendly,\u201d she says. \u201cI took my time at everything that I did. Everything was fast and everything was tough. Sometimes you make a mistake and, like you see on television, that is real life \u2014 people curse at you, people throw things at you.... It would be a lie to say I never wanted to quit, but I didn\u2019t give up.\u201dAksornnan, whose nickname is \u201cBao Bao\u201d (or \u201cbaby\u201d), worked her way up to head line cook during her two-year tenure in the esteemed kitchen before enrolling in culinary school. She cooked for several more years in well-known restaurants around the city, including a job working the cold station for a luminary French chef. But her dream was to work the hot station, preparing the meat and fish dishes: \u201cThey don\u2019t usually hire women to do those jobs because it\u2019s very heavy and tough.\u201d After spending years working for others but never being hired for the meat station, she got tired of waiting and struck out on her own.\u201cIt is a tough job,\u201d says Aksornnan. \u201cYou have to stand at least 13 hours a day and play with fire.\u201dBut, she adds, \u201cI love that.\u201dWhen it comes to furniture, Asa Pingree believes the chair is king. \u201cA table\u2019s a table,\u201d says the 35-year-old amidst a wall of rough-cut planks in his Brooklyn workshop. \u201cA dining chair is more of a boat, where the shape itself is so intricate to its function, every change of that shape changes how it behaves in the water. You have to make it very strong to put up with the torquing abuse.\u201dPingree, who grew up on a small island off the coast of Maine, understands a thing or two about boats. At age 14, while his friends spent summers earning buckets of money lobstering, he helped his father build a 55-foot yacht, barely making minimum wage. \u201cI was always a builder,\u201d he says. \u201cI was always making something. It was what I naturally enjoyed doing. Picking at something meticulously and getting it just right.\u201dThose long, hot seasons invested in crafting boats, which eventually led to a stint designing his own line of carbon-fiber skateboards for downhill racers, have paid off long-term for Pingree: Three years ago, he launched his eponymous company. Even after garnering attention from clients as well as the press, the realization that he could call himself a legitimate furniture designer didn\u2019t come easily.\u201cI almost thought, \u2018I\u2019m not allowed to do that,\u2019\u201d says Pingree, who has largely been influenced by mid-century Scandinavian designers. \u201c\u2018That\u2019s what great craftsmen get to do. At some point, I had to stop myself and say, \u2018You\u2019ve been doing the same thing your entire life, so of course you\u2019re good at it already.\u2019\u201dSince moving to New York in 2002, Pingree has consistently maintained various workshops to build things, though he\u2019s never undertaken any formal studies for his craft. \u201cWhy find out how it\u2019s done by everyone else in the world when you can figure it out on your own?\u201d he says, giving a nod to his mostly self-taught father, who now builds affordable housing back in Maine. \u201cThere\u2019s an inventor that\u2019s part of my creativity, and that inventor wants to figure out things on his own.\u201dPingree\u2019s current workshop sits inside a former bakery along the dividing line of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where the longstanding Orthodox Jewish community bumps up against a gentrified population of urban dwellers. His street is mostly industrial, and there\u2019s not much traffic, by car or foot, which allows the clattering of the nearby train line and the occasional sound of children to cut through the quietude of his space. But Pingree stays focused by pulling on a pair of headphones and listening to songs he\u2019s heard so many times they\u2019ve become white noise for him.For now, Pingree is still essentially a one-man production operation, spending his days cutting, sanding and building various pieces of American hardwood into furniture. Each piece is named after ships his family once owned, as far back as hundreds of years. \u201cI\u2019m driven by my need to create, and that is constant \u2014 the enjoyment of making shapes come alive,\u201d he says. \u201cThe impetus and inspiration definitely come from my hometown, my family.\u201dThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "Highlights: Italy Considers What\u2019s Next After Matteo Renzi Loses Referendum", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported by\u25a0 Mr. Renzi had said he would resign after voters rejected changes to the Constitution that he supported in what amounted to a referendum on the prime minister\u2019s government.As promised, Mr. Renzi submitted his resignation to Mr. Mattarella on Monday evening at the Quirinale Palace, the president\u2019s official residence, but the president asked Mr. Renzi to defer his resignation to see through the approval of his government\u2019s budget.An official from the office said the budget was expected to be passed this week.Mr. Mattarella\u2019s request was not unusual: His predecessor, Giorgio Napolitano, had \u201cfrozen\u201d the resignations of two prime ministers so that pending laws could be passed.Once Mr. Renzi\u2019s resignation eventually takes effect, Mr. Mattarella will work with Italian political leaders to discuss what comes next. \u2014 ELISABETTA POVOLEDO and JASON HOROWITZItaly greeted the news of Mr. Renzi\u2019s symbolic defeat with uncertainty on Monday. A headline in the daily La Repubblica declaring, \u201cThe No Triumphs, Renzi Quits,\u201d echoing the sentiment in most newspapers.Commentators acknowledged Mr. Renzi\u2019s dignified reaction to what mostly seemed a vote against his tenure, and they called for responsibility from political forces.\u201cNow the reality is the risk of a return to the swamps and to instability,\u201d Mario Calabresi, editor in chief of La Repubblica, wrote in a front-page editorial on Monday. \u201cA scenario that Italy really doesn\u2019t need.\u201dOnce Mr. Renzi\u2019s resignation is official and he steps down, Mr. Mattarella would then hold talks with the political parties trying to form a caretaker government or call early elections.According to the Italian news media, one candidate who could lead a temporary government is Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan, a technocrat. The speaker of the Senate, Pietro Grasso, a longtime anti-mafia magistrate, is also a possibility.Although most opposition parties are pushing for quick elections, opponents of Mr. Renzi in his Democratic Party are more inclined to take their time. \u2014 GAIA PIANIGIANIBeppe Grillo, the leader of the Five Star Movement who campaigned against the proposed constitutional changes and against Mr. Renzi, declared on Monday that \u201ctimes have changed.\u201dHow much so may depend on Mr. Grillo\u2019s ability to parlay his latest success into a full sweep of the political establishment he has thumbed his nose at for years.Mr. Grillo, a former comedian, said that Italians should waste no time pressing for a new electoral law and for the dismantling of the old order.The Five Star Movement won a quarter of the vote in 2013 national elections. Mr. Grillo said then that cooperating with traditional parties in any sort of alliance would be akin to capitulation.A breakdown of returns shows that opposition to the constitutional changes was widespread, though more pronounced in the south.Only three regions backed the changes: the historically leftist areas of Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna in central Italy, and Trentino-Alto Adige in the far north.In the economically struggling Sicily and Sardinia, which voted against the changes, the divide between the camps was as large as 44 percentage points. The pattern was similar in areas with high unemployment and social problems.\u201cThe country isn\u2019t growing, and voters blamed their personal condition on the government,\u201d said Stefano Folli, a commentator for La Repubblica.The results also reflected a generational divide. According to a survey reported by the news channel Sky TG24, young voters rejected the proposed changes, while more than half of those over 55 supported them. \u2014 GAIA PIANIGIANIIn analyzing the results, Italian pundits did not always agree, except on one point: the severe consequences for Mr. Renzi.\u201cDoes Renzi represent the country from a political, cultural point of view? Yesterday\u2019s vote is a clear rejection of Renzi\u2019s economic policies and of how he envisioned the country,\u201d the political commentator Mario Sechi said. Mr. Renzi \u201cdoesn\u2019t represent the zeitgeist of the nation, which did not follow him,\u201d he added.For Mr. Sechi, the Five Star Movement is the clear victor, even if the \u201cno\u201d campaign brought together divergent political forces.Sergio Fabbrini, director of the Luiss School of Government in Rome, said the outcome was less clear. Rejection of the constitutional changes was actually a reaction to Mr. Renzi\u2019s \u201creformist program that in some way threatened a big part of the social political equilibrium,\u201d he said.The nearly 60 percent of the population that voted against him is \u201chighly divided, with nothing in common, and no leader,\u201d Mr. Fabbrini said. What joins them is a conservative, anti-European outlook. \u201cWithin that, you have the most extreme left and right.\u201dThe person to watch in the short term is Mr. Mattarella, the president. \u201cThis is the first real test of the president of the Republic, who has kept mostly in the background,\u201d said Antonio Polito, deputy director of the Milan-based daily Corriere della Sera. \u2014 ELISABETTA POVOLEDOThe euro first fell as much as 1.5 percent against the dollar in Asian trading after the vote, but recovered by the morning in Europe, and it even gained ground compared with last week. Major European stock markets were all slightly higher. \u2014 JACK EWINGThe vote results and Mr. Renzi\u2019s decision to step down drew a jubilant response from other populist leaders in Europe.How leaders of European populist movements have reacted to the election of Donald J. Trump.The image of Italy as a nation that \u201cbobs more or less happily in stagnant water between the third largest public debt in the world and a banking system in a deep coma\u201d must be \u201cvigorously contested,\u201d he wrote.\u201cJust as a \u2018Yes\u2019 victory wouldn\u2019t have been a passport to paradise, the \u2018No\u2019 vote is not a condemnation to hell. In any case, hard and serious work is needed to face a massive challenge, of finding real growth and modernizing a system that\u2019s been weakened by a violent crisis and by innumerable problems that have been dragging on for decades.\u201dVincenzo Boccia, the president of Italy\u2019s main business lobby, Confindustria, said the referendum results highlighted the need to tackle pressing economic issues like \u201cdebt, deficit and still-insufficient growth.\u201d\u201cGrowth is the only way to eliminate inequalities and poverty,\u201d he said in a statement issued Monday morning. Italian companies have been making \u201ccrucial efforts\u201d to compete in international markets, he added, and need the government to back them up. \u2014 ELISABETTA POVOLEDOThe populist victory in Italy was hailed by many like-minded leaders across Eastern Europe, where similar sentiments are on the rise, but their reaction was tempered by widespread concern that the results would accelerate the fraying of the European Union, upon which the region has come to depend.Right-wing parties have been achieving electoral success in a growing number of nations.Poland, the largest economy in the region, seemed torn between praising a victory by populists who share its governing party views and worrying about vulnerability to Russia.Amid a migrant crisis and discontent with the European Union, many far-right parties have achieved electoral success. Here are eight of the most noteworthy.Tomas Sedlacek, chief macroeconomic strategist in Prague for the lender CSOB, tied the Italian defeat directly to Mr. Trump\u2019s victory and predicted a dire future. \u201cDemocracy, and the future of the euro in Europe, is truly walking on the edge of a knife,\u201d he said.In Slovakia, where anti-euro sentiment is widespread, many residents say that embracing the currency led to higher prices for everyday goods. \u201cWe can expect a referendum about leaving the eurozone,\u201d predicted Richard Zulik, leader of Slovakia\u2019s liberal Freedom and Solidarity party. \u2014 RICK LYMANFinance ministers from the 19 countries that use the euro expressed relief that the economic reaction to the Italian referendum was muted. Yet the vote could still roil the European Union: It threatens to embolden opponents of the single currency, which could destabilize the Italian economy and foment turmoil in the banking sector.Helping to stoke that concern is Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, Italy\u2019s oldest lender, which faces questions about whether it has sufficient capital.Asked whether a planned capital increase for the bank would now be delayed, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the president of the so-called Eurogroup of finance ministers, emphasized that Italy first needed to select a new leader.Even as Brussels scrambled to stave off negative financial consequences, ministers from fiscally hawkish countries like Germany and the Netherlands will not want to be seen by their own electorates as being overly permissive toward Italy.\u2014 JAMES KANTERAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Automated Assistants Will Soon Make a Bid for Your Finances", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byMr. Bloch\u2019s company currently creates free automated savings accounts \u2014 and has helped customers put aside over $250 million \u2014 but his vision is to add capabilities until Digit becomes a full-service financial assistant like Jane.\u201cEveryone needs a Jane,\u201d Mr. Bloch said.There is now a lot of competition to create an automated financial assistant for the masses.One feature that both Credit Karma and Mint will offer is more automated tax preparation of the sort that Jane provided for Ender (though with much less robotic charm and thoroughness).The start-ups and the banks are still far from delivering on the promise of a digital assistant that actually takes care of your financial problems for you. Credit Karma and Mint still require you to enter many of your own details. But all the players in the field are working with machine learning and artificial intelligence that will increasingly provide proactive analysis and advice rather than forcing someone to constantly check in.Many venture capitalists and entrepreneurs are betting that in the continuing transformation of finance by technology, the financial assistant category will be one of the most lucrative.\u201cThere is lots of opportunity here,\u201d said Charles Birnbaum, an investor at the venture capital firm Bessemer Venture Partners, who recently put money into Albert. \u201cThis is an opportunity that Mint and the banks should have done for people already \u2014 made it really easy to have a good sense for what you should be doing with your money.\u201dThe new personal financial advisers are taking a different tack compared with big-name financial technology start-ups like Lending Club and Square, which provide actual financial services: arranging loans and processing payments. Credit Karma and its competitors are betting that there is more value in being the neutral intermediary that helps customers find financial services and keep track of their various accounts.Advocates of this business model compare the opportunity to the one that Google and Facebook spotted in media, where they serve as so-called platforms for other media companies rather than being media companies themselves. This approach allowed them to become the primary point of contact with the customer, a very profitable and powerful place to sit.\u201cBy being Switzerland, and being neutral, in the same way that Google and Facebook are, we are finding the best products,\u201d said Nikhyl Singhal, a former Google executive who joined Credit Karma as the chief product officer last year. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the conflict where we are trying to sell our own product.\u201dCredit Karma in particular has been demonstrating how lucrative this can be by charging lenders and credit card companies for every customer it passes along. While the company does not say how much it charges, industry insiders say that Credit Karma generally makes $100 to $700 for every customer who signs up for a credit card, a significant chunk of the revenue that the credit card company will make in the first year. Credit Karma said it pulled in around $350 million of revenue last year.The business model creates the potential for conflicts of interest if an intermediary like Credit Karma sends customers to a credit card company or lender that pays the biggest referral fee rather than the one that offers the best deal for the customer. But the companies are all adamant that they will succeed only if they are known for doing what is best for the customer.Credit Karma now has 60 million account holders, 20 million of whom check in every month \u2014 about 10 times as many as its biggest rival, Mint, and nearly as many as some of the nation\u2019s largest banks.Founded in San Francisco in 2007, Credit Karma has been known for the niche service of providing customers with free access to credit scores, and advice on how to improve them.Recently, though, the company has been using its large pile of cash from venture capitalists to buy and build new features for customers, including one function that searches for unclaimed property for all of its customers and another that can identify and dispute credit report errors through the site.This week, the company is announcing its acquisition of a tax software company, OnePriceTaxes, that has been integrated into Credit Karma to allow free state and federal tax filings for every customer on the site.Ken Lin, the founder and chief executive of the site, said that once Credit Karma had access to a customer\u2019s tax filings it would have a much more detailed picture of that person\u2019s finances and could turn that into new layers of financial advice \u2014 by identifying, for instance, ways to invest money with more tax efficiency.For many, the best-known financial website is still Mint, which gained renown by allowing customers to track all their varied financial accounts in one place. It too makes money by pointing customers to outside financial products that pay Mint for each referral.But Mr. Lin and others in the industry said that Mint, which is now owned by Intuit, struggled to maintain its early growth because it required too much work from its customers, who have to categorize their transactions and do not get much in return.Al Ko, who became Mint\u2019s general manager last year, acknowledges that most Americans are not willing to do the work to keep track of their finances in Mint. As a result, he has led a rebuilding of Mint so that it will do more of the work for customers, and make active recommendations rather than just serve as a place to keep track of a budget.The first big step in Mint\u2019s expansion is the announcement this week of a dashboard that will monitor bills and remind customers when they are coming due, with increasingly urgent notifications as the date nears. Mint is also making it possible for customers to make payments directly through it, rather than a credit card site.Mr. Ko said that 6 percent of Mint customers failed to make even the minimum payment on their credit cards each month, a lapse that can lead to big fees and damaged credit scores.Mint and another Intuit division, TurboTax, are also being integrated so that tax forms from banks and credit cards will be automatically fed into customers\u2019 tax filings.\u201cI envision Mint being as ubiquitous as Facebook,\u201d Mr. Ko said. \u201cThis thing that helps me make better decisions and never forgets.\u201dDigit, the company inspired by Jane, has been rapidly picking up customers, and venture capital money. Now it needs to begin adding features to come closer to the original vision out of science fiction.\u201cEnder was a guy who saved the human race but didn\u2019t have time to do his own taxes,\u201d Mr. Bloch said. \u201cIf you want people to have financial health, you need to do it for them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Explanatory signs have been placed on the walls of the passageway and on the door with the \u201cMATF 1\u201d marking.At the moment, the passageway is not useful for disabled riders because it leads to a broad flight of 26 marble stairs down into the hub. Glenn P. Guzi, a program director at the authority, said an elevator will be installed next year.The passageway will serve riders on the A, C, E, 2 and 3 lines. Before the 2001 attack, about 10,000 people went through it daily, Mr. Plate said.After the twin towers were destroyed on Sept. 11, 2001, the passageway was closed. It reopened for a few years as a temporary connection between the subway and PATH commuter rail systems, then was closed to permit construction of the hub. During that time, the travertine, handrails and doors were covered in protective plywood.Handsome directional signs inside the passageway are to be reinstalled. A less-than-handsome overhead sign outside the passageway (\u201cPATH Trains to New Jersey\u201d) will not be coming back.Neither will WTC Newsstand & Novelties, next to the passageway, which was owned and operated by the brothers Reajul Islam and Fakrul Alam-Onar. In September 2015, Mr. Islam said business had dropped to between $100 and $200 a day, from $2,000 to $3,000 a day when the passageway was in use. The few people who stopped by, he said, limited themselves to bottled water or candy bars.Mr. Islam said at the time that he needed the passageway to reopen \u201cimmediately\u201d if business was to recover. More than a year elapsed. The newsstand straggled along. Then, at the end of November, the brothers surrendered their lease to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.A spokesman for the agency said the newsstand would probably be demolished.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Denver\u2019s Gritty Back Door Could Become Its New Gateway", "Date": "2016-12-27", "News": "Supported bySquare FeetAmong the unconventional work spaces and restaurants in the district, known as RiNo and north of downtown, is Comal, a lunch spot with Latin American cuisine where women from low-income backgrounds are learning how to run a business. In RiNo\u2019s recently opened Denver Central Market, shoppers can grab a sandwich, coffee or fresh fish,or sit at a bar and take in the scene.The neighborhood has attracted artists who helped gentrify the old and neglected industrial expanse, which in its dilapidated condition was long considered the back door into downtown from westbound I-70.Mr. Campbell, a former Wall Street bond trader who moved to Denver in 2010, is hardly the first investor to descend on RiNo in recent years, though the development\u2019s successful completion would rank as one of the most ambitious projects to date. He considers it the right place for a global commerce center, citing as draws the city\u2019s growing corporate roster, affordability and active outdoor culture.\u201cWhether you\u2019re in New York or the San Francisco Bay Area, Denver is going to be 60 cents on the dollar for the foreseeable future compared to those markets,\u201d Mr. Campbell said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing large companies saying, \u2018Places like Silicon Valley are nice, but we can use Denver and its Rocky Mountain backdrop as a lifestyle tool for recruitment and retention.\u2019\u201dThe first phase of the World Trade Center Denver project will include 250,000 square feet of offices and creative working space, a 200-room hotel, conference space, and shops and restaurants. It will be adjacent to a recently opened stop on a light rail line that connects Denver International Airport to Union Station downtown, about two miles away.Mr. Campbell is seeking tenants and financing, and he anticipates preleasing about 60 percent of the office space before beginning construction late next year.The World Trade Center Denver team and city officials supporting the project say it is the right time to promote the city internationally. They cite average year-over-year employment growth of 3.5 percent in the metro area from 2013 to 2015, and growth of more than 3 percent through October this year.Denver\u2019s diversified economy relies less on the boom-and-bust industries of energy and real estate than it did a few decades ago, they contend, and to a large degree, they credit the city\u2019s airport. When it opened in 1995, officials did not anticipate the high number of visitors, business travelers included, who would make Denver a destination rather than a stopover, said Tom Clark, chief executive of Metro Denver Economic Development Corp.Since then, the city has worked to increase nonstop flights to international destinations, he said. Today those include Munich, Tokyo and London, and the airport is pursuing flights into Dubai, Paris, Beijing and other markets.\u201cI\u2019ve lived through oil and gas ups and downs and the dot-com bust, but in none of those times did we have such a diverse economy,\u201d Mr. Clark said. \u201cThe transformative nature of the airport has turned us into a much different economic region.\u201dJust how different can be seen in RiNo, where private investors and the city are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to build it up and create a new gateway into Denver. Start-ups, and technology and creative companies have been migrating to the district for about the last five years, attracted to the area\u2019s cachet, as well as new buildings and converted warehouses that are now offices, food halls, brewpubs and entertainment venues.Larger established firms have also moved to the neighborhood or are planning to, including Uber, HomeAdvisor, a University of Colorado medical campus office and Boa Technology, a firm focused on closing systems for footwear like snowboarding boots.Other developers have added similar collaborative office environments in RiNo, and some three million square feet of office space is planned for the area, said Mr. Harrington, who is marketing a large mixed-use campus proposed by the local developer Westfield Company on 14 acres in the district. He estimated that as more office projects in RiNo are completed over the next several quarters, tenants would most likely pay $3 to $5 less per square foot than they would in the downtown and Lower Downtown submarkets, a discount of roughly 10 to 15 percent.One future disagreement is likely to be housing, Kyle Zeppelin predicted. Lenders have cooled to Denver apartment development, and he says he believes that market conditions are encouraging high-end condominium projects instead.\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s what RiNo needs or wants,\u201d said Mr. Zeppelin, who with his father is also developing a boutique hotel in RiNo next to the Source, a red brick foundry that they converted into an artisan food market.\u201cBut there\u2019s a disconnect between the urban fabric and culture of the neighborhood and what speculators want to do,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s a threat to the future potential of RiNo.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the approximate average cost for land in the River North Art District of Denver. It is $150 per square foot, not per acre.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Fund Seeks Both Financial and Social Returns", "Date": "2016-12-19", "News": "Supported byDealBook\u201cThere is a lazy mindedness that we afford the do-gooders.\u201dThat was Bono, the musician turned activist turned investor, lamenting the pitfalls of what has become an increasingly fashionable form of financing: social impact investing.Just about every big Wall Street firm and big-time philanthropist has recently tried to get in on what\u2019s often called double bottom line investing. The idea is that an investment isn\u2019t just intended to score a high return; perhaps more important, it is supposed to make a significant difference in an area that had been considered un-investable. Goldman Sachs, for example, created social impact bonds to reduce the recidivism rate for adolescent offenders at the Rikers Island correctional facility in New York City.Most of these efforts have had mixed results; either investors lost money, or the social impact was negligible or nonexistent.It has become, as Bono told me, \u201ca lot of bad deals done by good people.\u201dMr. McGlashan has long overseen TPG Growth, a fund he started that was an early investor in the sharing economy, with stakes in Uber and Airbnb, as well other technology successes like Spotify. His first fund had an annualized rate of return \u2014 the metric that private equity firms use to measure themselves \u2014 of 20 percent; the second fund\u2019s return was 45 percent.Others have tried to build social impact funds at a much smaller scale. Rise does away with benchmarks manufactured after the fact and has created a series of strict metrics by which to measure social impact. And an outside auditor has been brought in to keep it honest.And the investors involved don\u2019t consider this charity \u2014 pension funds and sovereign wealth funds are expected to be among the biggest investors. At least two large pension funds and one sovereign wealth fund have committed nine figure sums, according to people briefed on the investments, which have yet to be made public.\u201cThe reality is that no matter which side of the aisle you\u2019re on, and no matter where your framework is, if I can build a great business that\u2019s profitable and successful and, oh, by the way, here\u2019s the impact and the multiple of impact that\u2019s created through that business\u2019s successes, I think that\u2019s good for everybody,\u201d Mr. McGlashan told me.The new fund is expected to invest about half of its money domestically in areas like health care, education and clean energy technologies. The other half will be invested in emerging markets in sectors like microlending and other financial services, housing and education.\u201cWe\u2019re not in the business of charity here,\u201d Mr. McGlashan said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make money and build profitable successful businesses and create a top performing fund. But in the process, what we\u2019ve committed to is that we will not do a deal where there\u2019s less than a two and a half times multiple of impact,\u201d suggesting a meaningful social impact that can be measured.The problem with most of these kinds of funds is what Mr. McGlashan calls \u201cgreenwashing,\u201d a euphemism for lying, which some in philanthropy feel is rampant among socially conscious investors. Everyone wants to claim some form of success using a shifting mix of metrics aimed at demonstrating how the fund worked.\u201cNone of this makes sense unless you can actually define what \u2018impact\u2019 means,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be religion; it has to be quantitative. It has to be something that a third-party view would validate.\u201dBono put it this way: \u201cI asked them to hang a sign in their office saying, \u2018Warm Fuzzy Feelings Not Welcome Here,\u2019 because we need them to be tough-minded. We need some intellectual rigor, and you\u2019ve got to get these metrics right.\u201dMr. McGlashan, often in concert with Mr. Skoll, spent the past year working with Bridgespan Group, a consulting firm that has long worked for philanthropists \u2014 including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation \u2014 to come up with a rigorous set of metrics with which to measure performance.If it works, Mr. McGlashan hopes to one day change the fee structure of funds like this so the investors are paid based on social impact, not necessarily just on financial performance. For the first Rise fund, Mr. McGlashan\u2019s group, which will include most of TPG Growth\u2019s professional staff, will be paid on financial performance, which is likely to make his job harder, not easier. He needs to find good investments, but his board and investors will also be focusing on whether the fund also delivers on its social impact promise.Mr. Skoll said he expected to know whether the fund would be successful in relatively short order. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a good idea within two years,\u201d he said.Bridgespan\u2019s metrics for Rise could become a model for other investment firms if they prove successful, especially in a global political climate that is rethinking its capitalistic system.\u201cCapitalism is going up on trial, and I think that it\u2019s clear that putting profit before people is a nonsustainable business model,\u201d Bono said. \u201cI think giving those two equal time is the way forward, and I think that in the present climate, we need to rethink, reimagine what it is. It\u2019s not that capitalism is immoral; it\u2019s amoral. And it\u2019s a better servant than master.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe have to be a bit modest about where we are with Rise and be actually a bit tough on ourselves. I\u2019d be more comfortable speaking about this in a year\u2019s time or two year\u2019s time as we go along.\u201dLet\u2019s plan on that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can We Fix a Poisoned Planet Once We\u2019ve Poisoned the Social Compact?", "Date": "2016-12-09", "News": "Supported byNotebookAs I watched the returns come in on election night with my 2-month-old son, my thoughts turned to dust.Lead dust, to be specific. On the morning that my wife was due to give birth, I awoke to the sound of a loud mechanical hum. It took me a second to conclude it had nothing to do with my wife\u2019s imminent childbirth and another few seconds to determine that, in another way, it did. For I could see plainly that there were men on my neighbor\u2019s roof, sanding the walls of his house.As I\u2019d been warned by friends with children in New Orleans, where I live, the sanding of a neighbor\u2019s house in preparation for a paint job presented a threat of the highest magnitude, on the order of a child abductor on the loose from the local penitentiary, a rabid dog, a home invasion. It was, in fact, a kind of home invasion. New Orleans, like so many old American cities, has a catastrophic lead problem. The problem resides in the walls of old houses. As long as the old lead paint stays buried under the layers of new paint, you\u2019re safe. If the paint starts chipping, you\u2019ve got worry. But when you take an electric sander to the old paint, you weaponize the lead, grinding it to dust so fine it can be inhaled into a newborn\u2019s lungs. From there it enters the circulatory system, causing any number of neurological horrors, including irreversible brain damage \u2014 lower I.Q., reduced attention span, increased antisocial behavior. The Centers for Disease Control says that there is no minimum blood lead level in children known to be safe. My son was not yet born, but I already felt rising within me the parental defense instinct: full-blown anxiety tempered only slightly by inchoate rage.After flinging myself like a banshee, half-dressed and incoherent, at the workers \u2014 they agreed to put down their power sanders for the day \u2014 I turned to my friends for advice. Three couples had children who had already tested positive for dangerous levels of lead in their blood. Another three couples had remediated their properties. In one case, this meant painting every square inch of the wall with protective glaze; in another, burying a tainted back yard under acres of imported sand and dirt. One father, a professor at Tulane, whose neighbor had sanded her house and whose son subsequently tested positive for lead poisoning, had become a lead-abatement guru. He had taken it upon himself to master the local lead laws, the history of lead poisoning in America, the science of lead, the safe practices for sanding a house, the avenues of litigation available. He gave me a packet of information that I promptly handed to my neighbor, a very kind man who could not have been more sympathetic. He was the father of three and had even worked as an environmental auditor. He did not believe there was any lead in the walls of his house, but would delay work until he could have it tested.There was lead in the walls of his house. He agreed to take the precautions mandated by the city ordinance and in some cases went beyond them \u2014 replacing, for instance, every slat of wood on the side of the house facing our home to avoid sanding entirely. He was responsive and considerate. We were lucky. Most parents in New Orleans aren\u2019t so lucky. Most are not friends with Tulane professors who have researched the matter obsessively and know the right person in City Hall to contact if something goes wrong. Most don\u2019t have the luxury of working from home, where you can spy on the contractors next door all day long. Most don\u2019t have neighbors willing to spend thousands of dollars in order to do the right thing.Most parents in Louisiana aren\u2019t so lucky. The state has environmental codes and ordinances and a Department of Environmental Quality. But like the lead codes in New Orleans, they are unknown to the vast majority of citizens. Enforcement is minimal. Though it is too soon to evaluate the efficacy of the current administration \u2014 Jon Bel Edwards, a Democrat, has been governor less than a year \u2014 the state has a dismal record of environmental regulation. Calling it a \u201crecord\u201d might be overstating the case. E.P.A. investigations had found that state environmental regulators are \u201cexpected to protect industry\u201d and \u201ccould not assure the public that Louisiana was protecting the environment.\u201d This attitude is reflected in the state\u2019s production of hazardous waste (it ranks sixth in the nation), importing hazardous waste from other states (third), its cancer mortality rate (fifth). It is reflected in the electorate\u2019s ardent support of climate-change deniers for public office, despite the fact that Louisiana\u2019s coast faces one of the highest rate of sea-level rise on the planet.To understand what it will be like to live in a country under an administration hostile to environmental regulation \u2014 an administration that selects Scott Pruitt, an enemy of public-health protections who is heavily financed by fossil-fuel corporations, to run the Environmental Protection Agency \u2014 you don\u2019t need to read the science fiction of Margaret Atwood. You need not tour Eritrea, Somalia or the other countries at the bottom of the Environmental Performance Index. You don\u2019t need to watch \u201cMad Max: Fury Road.\u201d You need only to look at Louisiana. Putting aside the climate ramifications, which may render the planet unrecognizable within a couple of generations, most Americans will soon find themselves in the same place as most Louisianans. We will be on our own. We\u2019ll have to rely on rugged individualism. We\u2019ll have to do our own research, test our water and air, take it upon ourselves to demand enforcement of what regulations remain. The only alternative is to sit back and trust that our neighbors will do the right thing. But if we trusted our neighbors, we wouldn\u2019t have ended up here.Advertisement"}

Trump\u2019s transition team has asked federal border protection officials for guidance on where a new wall separating the United States from Mexico \u2014 a signature promise of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign \u2014 can be erected, according to a Democratic congressman from Texas who opposes the idea.But the officials exploring possible paths for such a barrier also appear to be considering fencing and other options short of the \u201cbig, beautiful wall\u201d that Mr. Trump regularly vowed to erect, at Mexico\u2019s expense, along a border of more than 1,900 miles.The discussions with federal border officials, along with separate talks with city officials in Laredo, Tex., one of the busiest crossings, come as aides to Mr. Trump maintain that construction of a border wall will be a top priority of his administration.In an interview, Representative Henry Cuellar, whose district includes a 200-mile stretch of border and reaches 150 miles north, to San Antonio, said that the chief patrol agents from two border sectors in the state had contacted him last week. They said they were doing so at the request of the incoming administration, Mr. Cuellar said, and solicited his ideas for where such a wall, or a fence, should be built.\u201cI\u2019m one of the few congressmen who doesn\u2019t have a fence in his area,\u201d Mr. Cuellar said. \u201cThey asked us to put some locations down, so we talked about areas they\u2019d proposed and some infrastructure, whether it\u2019s a wall or fencing.\u201dThe chief patrol agents, whom an aide to Mr. Cuellar identified as Mario Martinez of the Laredo sector and Manuel Padilla Jr. of the Rio Grande Valley sector, declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Customs and Border Protection, Carlos Diaz.According to Mr. Cuellar, the agents said they had argued against the transition team\u2019s request, and shared his view that it would be impossible to wall or fence off Laredo, a city of 255,000 and the busiest inland port on the American side of the border. They said the transition team had insisted.\u201cThe Trump headquarters came back and said no,\u201d Mr. Cuellar said he was told. \u201cThe Trump people wanted to see suggestions as to where a fence or wall could be put.\u201dA spokesman for the transition, Jason Miller, declined to comment.Mr. Cuellar was not the only Texas elected official approached by border officials about where to place a new barrier.The mayor of Laredo, Pete Saenz, said in an interview that officials from the Border Patrol\u2019s Laredo sector had approached the city manager last week with plans for removing vegetation and installing additional fencing, lighting, roads, surveillance equipment and other security measures along portions of the border.The plan did not mention a wall, said Mr. Saenz, a Democrat, which he said was \u201cfrankly, a big relief.\u201d But he said it included details about fencing that would be placed for short distances along key parts of the city on the border, including a water plant.Though it could gratify Mr. Trump\u2019s political supporters, erecting a new barrier would carry great significance in Laredo, which is across the Rio Grande from Nuevo Laredo, in Tamaulipas, Mexico. It has developed close ties with its sister city and grown into a trade hub.Walling off Laredo, Mr. Cuellar said, would damage the flow of commerce, among other things. \u201cIt\u2019s a 14th-century solution to a 21st-century problem,\u201d he said.But both he and Mr. Saenz sounded less than adamantly opposed to additional border fences.Some fencing already stands in vast portions of the 1,254-mile border between Texas and Mexico, Mr. Saenz noted.\u201cI would have no problem with it if it\u2019s strategically placed and it\u2019s well designed,\u201d Mr. Saenz said. \u201cIn other words, if it doesn\u2019t look too prisonlike. I think if we had a road, possibly a fence, and then lighting, I think that would help. I don\u2019t think the folks here would be too, too upset.\u201cBut the nature of a huge wall, concrete and that sort of thing, is upsetting,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe have a very close relationship with Mexico, especially the commerce that comes to our city, and a huge wall would obviously be offensive to Mexico and to the people that do business with Mexico here.\u201dMr. Saenz recalled that the Border Patrol years ago installed steel fencing along the perimeter of a community college on the border, which he said had deterred illegal border crossers from coming onto campus.\u201cTo be honest with you, I think we were happy with it,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it took care of the problem.\u201dBut no promise by Mr. Trump came to symbolize his campaign more than his call for a wall with Mexico to stop the flow of undocumented immigrants, and his top aides, including Reince Priebus, who is to serve as his chief of staff, say it remains a priority \u2014 though they have offered no further information on how a wall would be financed.\u201cWe have the lowest northbound apprehensions in modern history,\u201d despite spending a record $19.5 billion on border enforcement, said Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, a Democrat from El Paso.\u201cAdditional walls or fences, physical or virtual, are not a good use of taxpayer resources,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they also pose the risk of taking our eyes off threats where they are known to exist or likely to be, and that happens not to be at the border with Mexico.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Muilenburg, Boeing\u2019s chief executive, followed by Lockheed\u2019s chief executive, Marillyn A. Hewson, and Pentagon officials with models of the F-35 jets. The meetings took place at Mr. Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla.Mr. Muilenburg told reporters after the meeting that he had given Mr. Trump \u201cmy personal commitment\u201d that Boeing would build new Air Force One planes for less than the $4 billion estimate that Mr. Trump had cited.\u201cIt was a terrific conversation,\u201d Mr. Muilenburg said.Ms. Hewson released a statement saying that she and Mr. Trump had had \u201ca productive meeting\u201d and that she had briefed him on the company\u2019s progress in lowering the fighter jets\u2019 cost.Cost increases have bedeviled both the Bush and Obama administrations since the F-35 program began in 2001. It was conceived as an affordable way to build three versions of a strike fighter, one each for the Air Force, the Navy and the Marines. But it proved more complicated to tailor each variant for its service, and costs ballooned.Lockheed has built 200 of the jets so far, and Pentagon officials contend that the program has stabilized since it was restructured in 2011. But if Mr. Trump insists on cuts, military analysts said, the Pentagon could end up building far fewer jets than planned.Military analysts have said that the bulk of the cost of building new Air Force One jets would come from developing complex communications and protective systems, including antimissile defenses and shielding to protect against the electromagnetic effects of a nuclear blast.Mr. Muilenburg, the Boeing executive, said he and Mr. Trump discussed other topics, which neither identified publicly.Boeing officials have expressed concern that Mr. Trump\u2019s talk of tariffs on imports from China could prompt the Chinese to retaliate by buying more jets from Boeing\u2019s European rival, Airbus. Boeing also would like to see Mr. Trump support its plans to sell $16.6 billion in jets to Iran and keep providing guaranteed financing for other sales.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Streams? What Streams? For Newvelle Records, Vinyl Is the Future", "Date": "2016-12-26", "News": "Supported byPEEKSKILL, N.Y. \u2014 The jazz pianist Elan Mehler hovered over a vinyl-cutting lathe at Masterdisk studios as a mastering engineer laid a blank disc onto the plate and paused for a moment, listening for hints of interference as the blade sliced across the surface.Well, sort of en masse. Like everything at Newvelle, these records will be released only on vinyl, in small releases of 500. No CDs, no digital downloads, no streaming.It\u2019s all part of Mr. Mehler\u2019s plan to produce first-rate jazz recordings in the digital age. That the music will reach only a small handful of listeners, at least initially, is a necessary downside, Mr. Mehler said.\u201cIt\u2019s a model that sustains the music,\u201d he said. \u201cI came to this idea of how to record because of how difficult it is to make a record as a jazz musician.\u201dMr. Mehler first had the idea to start a label that would marshal the appeal of vinyl a few years ago, while living in Paris. He mentioned it to Mr. Morisseau, 48, a French businessman who was taking piano lessons from him. They started meeting regularly and sketched out a plan.Musicians would receive a flat fee to record their albums, with Newvelle fronting the cost of production at a world-class studio in Lower Manhattan. The label would retain exclusive rights to the music for two years, offering it only on elegantly packaged vinyl and only to subscribers, who would pay $400 for a year\u2019s worth of recordings: six in all, sent at two-month intervals.After two years, the artists would have the right to release the music independently, as long as Newvelle retained exclusive vinyl-distribution privileges.Mr. Mehler and Mr. Morisseau released their first season over the past year, reaching about 200 subscribers, and in November they completed a Kickstarter campaign to finance the second. That drive signed up about 50 subscribers and raised over $25,000.Newvelle\u2019s records adhere to the kind of gossamer, \u201cchamber jazz\u201d aesthetic that characterizes most of Mr. Mehler\u2019s work as a pianist, but they feature a range of musicians, from jazz\u2019s nobility to its rising stars.Each album in the first season featured images by the French photographer Bernard Plossu, and poems from the Pulitzer Prize winner Tracy K. Smith were printed in the liner notes. This season, which is priced at $360, the albums will feature photos by the French collective Tendance Floue. The novelist Douglas Kennedy is writing a short story that will be serialized across the six records, with a different portion on each album cover.Rufus Reid, an esteemed bassist, has recorded an album for the coming season, featuring his jazz trio alongside the Sirius String Quartet. He said he was grateful for the opportunity to produce a graceful product and to see his ambitions encouraged rather than resisted. \u201cI think there\u2019s been a longing for people to listen more intently, and the vinyl kind of makes you do that,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cOther labels aren\u2019t really putting out any cash for the whole kit and caboodle of recording an album.\u201d\u201cThe vinyl form, for Elan, really represented this idea of a pure sound, something that\u2019s very high-quality and that every artist is very keen on,\u201d Mr. Morisseau said. \u201cSo my idea was to say, \u2018O.K., let\u2019s treat the vinyl and the music like a luxury good.\u2019\u201dFor Newvelle\u2019s musicians, the studio does not serve as a conduit to a broad audience so much as a site for the celebration of their craft. It does little to emulate the bandstand, jazz\u2019s onetime breeding ground, but it does suggest a survival technique for jazz in lean times. And it signals that when jazz becomes a luxury item, product may matter more than populism.Advertisement"}

He did so again Tuesday, when asked if he would support the City Council\u2019s bill and whether that would be a tacit acknowledgment that the nonprofit group had been \u201ca problem.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m perfectly comfortable signing the bill,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m only acknowledging that it became a big distraction even though everything was done properly.\u201dMr. de Blasio\u2019s 2013 campaign took the same approach in responding to the finance board, which found that his campaign had made late filings, accepted donations over the city\u2019s strict limits, and spent money that could not be documented as related to the campaign.According to the board\u2019s report, the campaign said the presence of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s son at the rally commemorating the anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech, was appropriately paid for with campaign funds because his son, who is black, appeared at the event as \u201ca visible manifestation of how the candidate\u2019s life experience was resonant to the spirit of the occasion.\u201dDan Levitan, a spokesman for the campaign, defended the spending on makeup and said the travel to Washington \u201cwas an important trip taken as part of the campaign,\u201d even if the mayor had not at that point formally declared his candidacy. Mr. Levitan said the fines would be paid out of money raised in anticipation of a 2013 runoff.Dick Dadey, president of the government watchdog group Citizens Union, said the fines against the mayor\u2019s campaign were \u201cevidence of sloppy inattentiveness that may be at root of why City Hall is being investigated for its fund-raising practices.\u201dThe bill passed by the City Council prohibits donations exceeding $400 from lobbyists or those who do business with the city to nonprofit groups controlled by local elected officials or their staffs \u2014 the same limit for such donations directly to candidates \u2014 and would require donations to be disclosed. Mr. de Blasio\u2019s nonprofit group voluntarily disclosed the donations it had received, which totaled more than $4 million, much of it from unions, lobbyists and companies with business before the city.\u201cWe won\u2019t know for certain what happens to the Campaign for One New York until investigations of its practices have concluded,\u201d said Melissa Mark-Viverito, the City Council speaker, in describing the bill, which is in a package of 21 bills addressing campaign finance issues. \u201cBut we do know that it exposed loopholes in our election and ethics laws that need to be remedied, and we are doing that with this bill.\u201dSeparately, Mr. Dadey and other government groups praised the City Council\u2019s efforts to address a \u201cre-emerging pay-to-play culture in City Hall,\u201d but criticized other bills in the package. The 21 bills, which address various issues, including how donation cards are filled out and when certain disclosures are filed, were introduced last month with little opportunity for public input.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump, Seeking Ambassadors, Sorts Through Competing Priorities", "Date": "2016-12-21", "News": "Supported byPresident-elect Donald J. Trump appears to believe he owes little to the Republican establishment donor set, a majority of whom opposed him. He also ran a campaign that challenged longstanding shibboleths of American diplomacy.Mr. Trump\u2019s choice of ambassadors could be a sign of how serious he is about both those stances. But as his transition team begins sifting through possible choices for a dozen major embassies, the signals are unclear.So far, Mr. Friedman is the exception. As the intense jockeying for ambassadorships has begun among donors, loyalists to Mr. Trump and, in some cases, people close to his children, his advisers have potentially competing priorities.If Mr. Trump chooses Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets who is a longtime Republican donor and a friend of the president-elect, or someone like Peter S. Kalikow, the New York developer and Trump supporter, he would be following a familiar script.If he chooses someone like Jon M. Huntsman Jr. for Japan, Mr. Trump would be trying to match a Republican establishment figure with a region he is familiar with. Mr. Huntsman has served as ambassador to China and Singapore.If he goes for someone like Robert Pence, a Virginia developer who did not support Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy but who has been recommended by Vice President-elect Mike Pence, it would fall more in line with his choice of Ms. Haley and of bringing outsiders into the fold. (The two Pences are not related).The expectation is that Mr. Trump will begin by rewarding supporters with appointments to Western Europe or the Caribbean, as is often the case with new administrations. But they could also include donors to his campaign or transition, people he might need again in the future.\u201cThey generally start out more political,\u201d said Asgeir Sigfusson, the communications director for the American Foreign Service Association. \u201cThe numbers will even out.\u201dIn previous administrations, he said, about 70 percent of nominations were foreign service professionals and 30 percent were political appointees. It remains to be seen if Mr. Trump will adhere to that breakdown, Mr. Sigfusson said.Aides to Mr. Trump declined to comment, beyond saying that discussion about candidates was in the early stages.There are some favorites among the names Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers are batting around, however, and meetings on the subject are expected to increase in frequency starting this week.Mr. Trump\u2019s aides are sifting through a broad list of recommendations from people involved in the transition process, including the president-elect\u2019s daughter Ivanka and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. As a result, the suggestions have included people who did not immediately support the Trump ticket, such as Ronald J. Gidwitz, who backed Jeb Bush in the primaries.Then there are more personal recommendations from people involved in the transition. One was for Morris Goldfarb, the chief executive of the G-III Apparel Group, which had a licensing agreement for Ms. Trump\u2019s apparel line. Another was former Gov. James Gilmore of Virginia, who has been recommended by Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, a Trump adviser.And there are a raft of donors and longtime Republicans angling for appointments who could expect particularly close scrutiny by Democrats during confirmation hearings.\u201cI think confirmation is always problematic,\u201d said Mel Sembler, a party fund-raiser appointed ambassador to Australia by the elder President George Bush and to Italy by the younger.\u201cThe first time out, it was a long and embarrassing and difficult process,\u201d Mr. Sembler said. Old scars become new information as senators start their review, he said.Some donors could see old troubles resurface.Mr. Kalikow, the New York developer, who filed for personal bankruptcy when he owned The New York Post more than two decades ago, has been mentioned for a possible post. So has Georgette Mosbacher, a socialite whose husband, now deceased, was the focus of a lawsuit over a flawed census count in 1990. Neither Mr. Kalikow nor Ms. Mosbacher would comment for this article.Duke Buchan, major supporter of Jeb Bush and a defender of the work of Right to Rise, the \u201csuper PAC\u201d backing that candidate, joined the Trump effort in the summer and contributed significantly to his campaign. Mr. Buchan has expressed interest in becoming ambassador to Spain, where he says he studied and where a company he once held stock in recently owned property. He also used to own shares in a company that holds military contracts, records show.Mr. Buchan, who does not know Mr. Trump well, has had blunt discussions about how to best position himself for an ambassadorship, according to people close to the transition. He did not respond to requests for comment.Fred V. Malek, a former aide to President Richard M. Nixon and to the elder President Bush, said that being a donor did not guarantee anything.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that somebody can be a fund-raiser and just have an ambassadorship,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to have some credentials.\u201dAt least two prospective candidates from the donor community, according to people with direct knowledge of the discussions, are likely to end up with posts.Lewis M. Eisenberg, the Republican National Committee finance chairman who raised money with Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, is seen as a possible choice for Italy. Mr. Johnson, the Jets owner, is a leading choice for Britain.Joseph Forgione, who was passed over for secretary of housing and development, has support to become ambassador to the Vatican. So does William E. Simon Jr., an ally of Rudolph W. Giuliani, who recommended him.R. Nicholas Burns, an ambassador to Greece under President Bill Clinton, said that the State Department typically put forward a list of people to consider, and that incoming presidents should be aware of their options.\u201cI think President-elect Trump would be well advised to broaden the circle of people he consults in making these appointments,\u201d Mr. Burns said.An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the corporate role of Morris Goldfarb. He remains the chief executive of the G-III Apparel Group, and did not recently leave that post.Advertisement"}

There\u2019s a lot of faith involved, in other words \u2014 on the part of the entrepreneurs, who are betting they can beat the auto industry at its own game, as well as the small investors putting up the table stakes, a few dollars at a time.\u201cThe wisdom of the crowd determines the viability of these companies,\u201d said Ron Miller, chief executive of StartEngine in Santa Monica, Calif. His company provides marketing and financial services to start-ups that are raising money through crowdfunding.\u201cA large number of unsophisticated people,\u201d he said, \u201care likely to be more accurate than a handful of sophisticated people.\u201dMr. Sondors aims to raise $1 million to create prototypes, although he expects to need $12 million to start production in two years, if all goes according to plan.\u201cWhatever I create is bold but proven technology,\u201d Mr. Sondors said, citing his experience in electric bikes, of which he has sold more than 15,000 for $500 or more each.\u201cI want to figure out how to make an electric car cost-efficiently,\u201d he said. One way to do that is to use three wheels rather than four.The government currently classifies a vehicle with three wheels as a motorcycle. Consequently those manufacturers do not have to meet federal regulations that pertain to safety and crash protection for cars.But it is yet another set of federal rules that makes it possible for start-ups like Sondors Electric Car to raise financing.Under securities rules sometimes referred to Regulation A-Plus, which took effect late last year, small companies are allowed to raise up to $50 million each year through stock or debt. Much of it can come from individuals who are not \u201cqualified\u201d \u2014 that is, from people making less than $200,000 per year, or having net assets below $1 million.To prevent swindlers from trying to shake down na\u00efve investors, the Securities and Exchange Commission bars certain \u201cbad actors\u201d from being on a company\u2019s management team. That includes those with certain criminal convictions, or those who have engaged in fraudulent activities or are subject to cease-and-desist orders.Even so, an unsophisticated investor who does not know how to evaluate a start-up could easily wind up losing substantial sums of money.Darren Marble, chief executive of CrowdfundX, which handles marketing and advertising for crowdfunding efforts, recommends that a nonqualified individual never invest more than 5 percent of his or her investable assets in Regulation A-Plus deals.\u201cAnd diversify,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Marble advised. \u201cInvest that 5 percent over 10 or 20 companies.\u201dThe aspiring carmakers who have resorted to crowdfunding invariably think they see an angle that the mainstream automakers have either missed or are too big and bureaucratic to pursue.\u201cCrowdfunding is all about storytelling,\u201d said Mr. Marble, who conducted Elio Motors\u2019 effort. \u201cYou need to tell a story that emotionally inspires people. Financial return is secondary to this for investors.\u201dThe storyteller in Elio Motors\u2019 case is Paul Elio, the founder. He, like Mr. Sondors, spins a vision of a three-wheeler. But in Elio Motors\u2019 tale, it will be a gasoline-powered vehicle that gets 84 miles per gallon, with a $7,300 starting price, to be built in a former General Motors plant in Shreveport, La.To date, 63,000 buyers have reserved an Elio, depositing up to $1,000 to secure a place in line. At least some of the deposits are nonrefundable.Crowdfunding may have put Elio Motors on the map, but Mr. Elio acknowledges that he still needs considerably more funding to make his project a reality. He has had to postpone the debut several times, and now expects to begin selling his car in late 2017 or early 2018.To date, he has raised $100 million through various sources, and says he needs $300 million for the venture to be self-sustaining. If he can pull it off, that would be much less than the billions it typically takes a major automaker to create a car.He plans to use the former G.M. plant\u2019s assembly equipment and components from outside suppliers. Using someone else\u2019s steering wheel, he said, cut out $1 million in testing costs.\u201cMost of our vehicle content is out of something else,\u201d said Mr. Elio, a mechanical engineer who formerly worked for Johnson Controls, a big maker of automotive parts.For Mr. Elio and others, crowdfunding is not meant to be the sole source of capital. Rather, by raising capital through many less-wealthy people, companies hope to pique the interest of larger investors who otherwise would not give them the time of day.\u201cWhen they don\u2019t see a revenue stream, their heads pop off,\u201d Mr. Elio said. \u201cVenture capitalists say, \u2018Hey, it\u2019s great, but I only do biotech.\u2019 No venture capitalists specialize in car companies. But the public just sees a good company.\u201dOne company that already sells a car is looking to crowdfunding for additional capital.Now Campagna wants to expand, aiming to increase its sales and service network tenfold. The company also wants to develop a new vehicle that would sell in the $30,000 range, compared to current prices that start at $54,000.So far, Campagna has raised $26,500 from 67 investors. The company wants to raise at least $100,000.\u201cWe looked at traditional venture capital funding, but manufacturing in North America is not sexy to this group,\u201d said Andr\u00e9 Morissette, Campagna Motors\u2019 president. \u201cWe now have investors who have tattoos.\u201dMany of the start-ups are aiming for niche markets with small, offbeat cars meant to attract people who are open to experimentation or aren\u2019t interested in conventional automobiles. Ronn Ford, though, aims to build a better sports car. An electric one.Mr. Ford, no relation to the automotive family of the same name, has spent his professional life restoring high-end vehicles. He expects to sell his 350-mile-range electric sports car for $140,000.\u201cI\u2019m not a wallowing behemoth with a giant bureaucracy,\u201d Mr. Ford said. \u201cYou can do all your crash testing via computer. We\u2019ll buy off-the-shelf componentry to be more efficient. We can buy aftermarket bodies and do 3-D printing for prototypes. It\u2019s just not that difficult.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Linde C.E.O.\u2019s Job: Make Himself Redundant", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsThe success of Linde\u2019s new chief executive, Aldo Belloni, will be measured by an unusual yardstick: whether he can make himself redundant. The German industrial gases group on Wednesday hauled the 66-year-old Mr. Belloni out of retirement to secure a $65 billion merger with the American rival Praxair.Linde walked away from talks in September because Praxair\u2019s proposals offered too little power for the deal to count as a merger of equals. Praxair last week unexpectedly signaled it might be willing to make concessions, such as ensuring that Linde\u2019s Munich headquarters has an influential role in the merged company. But that change of heart left Linde scrambling for a credible management team to resume talks. The chief executive, Wolfgang Buechele, was set to leave the company in April 2017, and Georg Denoke, the finance director who opposed the deal and left in September, has yet to be replaced.The German company has found an interim C.E.O. quickly, but in this case the adage of more haste, less speed does not hold. Mr. Belloni is a good pick. He had worked for Linde for more than three decades by the time he retired in 2014 and knows the company inside out. A two-year contract gives him time to steer the group through the negotiations as well as the transition. By then he will be 68 and unlikely to compete with Praxair\u2019s boss, Steve Angel, for the top job in the merged group.Even more important, Linde\u2019s powerful unions trust Mr. Belloni. Their concern that a merger would spell more job cuts and less influence was one reason talks with Praxair collapsed before, since workers name half the members of the supervisory board in listed German companies.Unions now back the decision to restart negotiations. Hopes that a merger could be less painful than the tough restructuring program Linde announced in October might have played a role. Twinned with Praxair\u2019s apparent willingness to share power more evenly, this gives Mr. Belloni a good chance of successfully making himself superfluous.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi Royal Family Is Still Spending in an Age of Austerity", "Date": "2016-12-27", "News": "Supported bySecrets of the KingdomTANGIER, Morocco \u2014 Behind a tall perimeter wall, studded with surveillance cameras and guarded by Moroccan soldiers, a sprawling new palace for King Salman of Saudi Arabia rose on the Atlantic coast here last summer.Even as the Saudi government canceled a quarter of a trillion dollars\u2019 worth of projects back home as part of a fiscal austerity program, workers hustled to finish bright blue landing pads for helicopters at the vacation compound and to erect a tent the size of a circus big-top where the king could feast and entertain his enormous retinue.The royal family\u2019s fortune derives from the reserves of petroleum discovered during the reign of Salman\u2019s father, King Abdulaziz ibn Saud, more than 75 years ago. The sale of oil provides billions of dollars in annual allowances, public-sector sinecures and perks for royals, the wealthiest of whom own French chateaus and Saudi palaces, stash money in Swiss bank accounts, wear couture dresses under their abayas and frolic on some of the world\u2019s biggest yachts out of sight of commoners.\u201cThe people have less money than before, but the royal family have the same,\u201d said Prince Khalid bin Farhan al-Saud, a dissident member of the extended family living in Germany. \u201cThere is a lot of state money which is concealed from the budget, which is determined by the king alone.\u201dThese are anxious times for the royals, led by an 80-year-old who has already had at least one stroke and is likely to be the last of six sons of the founding monarch to serve as sovereign. He must wrangle a band of relatives, from the merely well-off to billionaires, who are accustomed from birth to privilege and plenty.While there are serious problems beyond the borders \u2014 a costly war in Yemen, violence in Iraq and Syria, an emboldened Iran \u2014 it is the country\u2019s economic troubles that risk roiling ordinary citizens, if their own cradle-to-grave benefits are cut too much. Many royals are wary of any disclosures about their wealth that could provoke public criticism.Revenues from the national oil company, Saudi Aramco, have long been the lifeblood of government spending. Some in the family have resisted a proposal by the king\u2019s son Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to partly privatize it, since listing it on stock exchanges in New York or London would bring new audits of Aramco and possibly more insights into government funding, and in turn, money for the royals.That concern has led some senior family members to quietly explore alternatives to the privatization plan, though Saudi officials said it remains on track.Facing huge budget gaps, the government has cut public-sector pay along with subsidies, sending gasoline, electricity and even water bills higher. The kingdom has begun borrowing by the billions both at home and abroad. And hiring by the government \u2014 a large and sought after employer for Saudis \u2014 has been cut, instilling fear for the future in younger people who cannot find work.Royals are sharing the pain, according to Anas al-Qusayer, the spokesman for the Ministry of Culture and Information, who said that their allowances had been reduced. At least some royals, though, have seen no decline in their stipends, according to several Saudis close to the family.Some Saudi royals are still spending big. Dania Sinno, a real estate agent with Belles Demeures de France, said that multiple family members had been buying property in Paris in the last year. She recently sold a nearly 11,000-square-foot apartment on the exclusive Rue Octave-Feuillet for more than $30 million to a Saudi princess.The king, of course, does not lack for options at home, with a network of marble-columned palaces and countryside retreats stretching from the Red Sea to the Persian Gulf. But the Tangier compound appears to be his current favorite getaway.During his visit this summer, some hundred black Mercedes sedans and Range Rovers were waiting to chauffeur the royal party around town. The palace complex includes its own medical facilities and top-flight restaurant kitchens that turn out dishes with lobster, caviar and truffles flown in from France.Some on the household staff, who did not want to be identified so they could continue working for the Saud family, said they received an unusual gratuity when they handed in their ID badges: a free trip for a pilgrimage to Mecca.Salman bin Abdulaziz was born in 1935, just three years after his father proclaimed the new Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The power and legitimacy of the new state rested on the twin pillars of the royal family and their allies in the ultraconservative Wahhabi religious leadership. Oil, discovered in the country\u2019s east in 1938, provided a growing source of funding for both.As a young prince, Salman recalled when the family still lived in tents part of the year, as he has recounted to Secretary of State John Kerry. He could not have assumed as a boy that he would someday rule his father\u2019s dominion. King Abdulaziz entered into numerous marriages \u2014 with 17 known wives, producing at least 36 sons \u2014 to cement alliances with the many Arabian tribes.Salman, believed to be the 25th son, had one advantage in this sprawling, competitive family, where royal succession does not always follow a straight line. His mother, Hassa al-Sudairi, was a favorite wife of the king, and Salman was one of seven full brothers, a powerful bloc known as the Sudairi Seven.In contrast to the traditional robes and headdresses King Salman wears in public today, an early photo shows a dapper young man in a well-cut Western suit. In nearly half a century as governor of Riyadh, he presided over the explosion of a modest desert way station into a metropolis with millions of inhabitants, along with skyscrapers, multilane highways and palaces for the newly rich royals.The global shock of the oil embargo in 1973 sent prices soaring and petrodollars flooding into the country. Despite imposing rigid adherence to a strict version of Islam on their subjects, some Saudi princes became fixtures at high-rolling pleasure capitals like Monte Carlo.Through dozens of interviews with diplomats and money managers, economists, real-estate and travel agents, interior decorators and members of the House of Saud and by reviewing court records and real-estate documents, The New York Times has pieced together details of the family\u2019s spending.The scale of the clan\u2019s fortune is a closely guarded secret. The money is divided among many relatives and spread across several continents, making a precise accounting difficult. The funding mechanisms are opaque by design. The share of the Saudi budget that ultimately makes its way into royal coffers is not disclosed. Even people who closely follow the Saudi royal family said they could not estimate its total assets.While chinks in the wall of secrecy appear through legal cases and tabloid reports overseas, the royals have learned not to flaunt their wealth before the nation\u2019s 30 million commoners. The family members have erected high walls around their palaces, bought overseas assets with shell companies, used intermediaries for large investments and demanded nondisclosure agreements from employees.Saudi Arabia is not nearly as affluent on a per-capita basis as Qatar or Kuwait, which are also rich from oil and gas but support far fewer people than their large neighbor. (Both also have been hit hard by the low oil prices.) Despite a robust social safety net \u2014 including free education and health care \u2014 there are poor Saudis, and many in the middle class barely make ends meet.Princes and princesses can take advantage of privileges like special hospital wings decorated like palaces with five-star hotel service, and royal airport terminals with enormous chandeliers, intricate tilework and rich carpets. But even among royals, there are big differences between direct heirs to the kings and cousins on the fringes. Some younger princes live in large, but not palatial, modernist homes outside Riyadh that would not be out of place in upscale California neighborhoods. They drive Range Rovers and boxy Mercedes S.U.V.s rather than the Lamborghini or Bugatti supercars their better-off cousins race around the Knightsbridge section of London.But the Saudi ministry spokesman, Mr. Qusayer, said there were no more than 5,000 members of the House of Saud. The difference may stem in part from whether or how one counts distant relatives and families who ruled back before the time of King Abdulaziz, the current king\u2019s father.At some point, the family could grow too large to support. \u201cThere has to be some decision about lopping off some of the branches,\u201d said F. Gregory Gause III, a Middle East specialist at the Texas A&M University Bush School of Government and Public Service.Members of the royal family rely on allowances, government jobs and positions in business, aided by the status and connections conferred by nobility. Exactly how benefits are parceled out beyond seniority and service is unknown, said Mr. Kechichian, who is a senior fellow at the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies in Riyadh.\u201cWhat we do know is that the monarch has, for lack of a better term, let\u2019s say petty cash to distribute to various members of the family for their projects, for their businesses, for their life,\u201d he said in an interview.The stipends then ranged from up to $270,000 a month for a son of the founding king to $8,000 a month for his great-great-grandchildren, the official reported. Bonuses of $1 million to $3 million were given to some royals as wedding gifts for palace construction. The official estimated in a memorandum, released with other documents by WikiLeaks five years ago, that the allowances, which included payments to other prominent families around the kingdom, accounted for roughly $2 billion of the government\u2019s total $40 billion budget, or 5 percent of all public spending.The Saudi spokesman, Mr. Qusayer, said that the current total for annual allowances did not exceed 10 billion riyals, or $2.7 billion. The largest share, he added, went to tribal and provincial leaders, not royals.\u201cThose who are familiar with the Saudi social hierarchy know very well that the thousands of tribes\u2019 leaders and provinces\u2019 notables spend directly and indirectly most of their allowances on hundreds of thousands of people they are responsible for,\u201d he wrote.The United States memo cited Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the billionaire investor, as having told the American ambassador that revenue from one million barrels of oil per day went into off-budget programs under the control of the king and several top princes.An adviser to several members of the family and a former senior American government official said that the off-budget programs still existed; it is unclear in what amounts. Both spoke only on the condition of anonymity, for fear of alienating the Saudi government. Mr. Qusayer said that \u201cwhatever is generated from Aramco is directed to the state\u2019s public treasury.\u201dThe line between family and state assets can be blurry. United States officials have described in multiple memorandums significant land transfers to sons and grandsons of the king, and even outright grabs, such as one prince who simply had the fence line around his property slowly expand outward to encompass another 30 square miles.\u201cIf you tell me that building this whole country, and spending $350 billion out of $400 billion, that we had misused or got corrupted with $50 billion, I\u2019ll tell you, \u2018Yes,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll take that anytime.\u201dMany royals have succeeded in business by acting as the exclusive agents for foreign companies in the kingdom. Others are involved in enterprises that depend on government spending doled out by relatives or that thrive on heavy state subsidies.\u201cAs long as the royal family views this country as \u2018Al Saud Inc.,\u2019 ever increasing numbers of princes and princesses will see it as their birthright to receive lavish dividend payments, and dip into the till from time to time, by sheer virtue of company ownership,\u201d the American embassy official concluded.As the size of the family and the general population have grown, some observers say, the balance of rewards has become harder to maintain.\u201cAt the top level, they know that they have to leave something for the rest of the country; otherwise they\u2019ll be out on their ear,\u201d Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Seznec, senior fellow at the Global Energy Center at the Atlantic Council, said of the royal family. \u201cIf you ask the population to make sacrifices in order for the state to get money, you can\u2019t have one part of the society take advantage.\u201dWhen Salman\u2019s half brother King Abdullah ascended to the throne in 2005, he tried to rein in some family excesses. Thousands of princes and princesses had free cellphones disconnected. Unlimited flights on the national airline, Saudia, were cut back so that large entourages no longer traveled gratis and blocks of tickets were no longer resold for profit.Suites at hotels in Jidda, paid year-round by the government, were relinquished. King Abdullah also tried to reduce the practice of land-grabbing and the abuse of the visa system for guest workers. Some princes received block grants of visas and profited from selling them to the workers cooking, cleaning and building across the kingdom.Among those who opposed King Abdullah in paring back privileges and entitlements, according to diplomatic cables, were Prince Salman and his brother Prince Nayef. The princes\u2019 older full brother, Crown Prince Sultan, told them that challenging the king was a \u201cred line.\u201d If the family did not stick together, he warned, it would mean trouble for all of them.Senior members of the House of Saud are keenly aware that they lost their previous kingdom in the 19th century because of family infighting. King Saud was deposed in 1964 and replaced by his brother King Faisal, who, in turn, was assassinated by a nephew.As governor of Riyadh, Salman helped oversee the family, even maintaining a jail for young princes who ran amok. \u201cWhen there was a problem in the family, misbehavior by one of the sons, the person invariably called upon to conciliate and solve the problem was Salman,\u201d said the former United States ambassador Chas W. Freeman Jr., who knew him in Riyadh.Salman, who succeeded Abdullah in January 2015, bestowed an estimated $32 billion on his subjects, including bonuses of two months\u2019 salary to government employees. Oil prices had begun their precipitous decline, but it was not yet clear how far they would fall.Three months later, the king promoted his nephew Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, now 57, as the first crown prince among the founding king\u2019s grandsons, and his own son, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, now 31, as next in line. The king surprised his court by giving his son broad power, naming him defense minister, head of the economic council and ultimately responsible for Aramco. He also removed several sons of former kings from important positions.\u201cYou have resentment in other branches of the family at their sudden disempowerment,\u201d said Mr. Freeman, the former ambassador.Last year, an anonymous letter by a nephew of the monarch was published online, calling on his uncles to remove their brother, King Salman. In a second letter a couple of weeks later, the prince claimed that $100 billion had been given to the new king\u2019s sons, while the proceeds of two million barrels of oil a day were in the deputy crown prince\u2019s hands.Mr. Qusayer, the Saudi spokesman, said that information was wrong. He said that the prince\u2019s \u201cwords were manipulated\u201d and that a dissident in London had written the letter.The Saud clan remains quietly at odds over how to proceed, with doubts about Prince Mohammed\u2019s economic reform plans and his stewardship of the war in Yemen.\u201cThe family always wants to be unified, so even if they are unhappy, they are trying to stay unified,\u201d said a senior prince who is the son of a former king, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions from others in the family.Indeed, criticizing the monarchy carries risks. Three princes who were living abroad and had spoken out against Saudi policy have disappeared from view since King Salman came to power. They are believed to be back in Saudi Arabia, where they cannot voice their disagreements. (The Saudi spokesman said they were not in jail or under house arrest.)While members of the family have been investing overseas for decades, the pace of buying homes abroad has quickened in the last two years, according to Ardavan Amir-Aslani, a business lawyer who has advised Saudi princes on real estate acquisitions in France. \u201cIn the event the situation becomes dire for them, they want to have an option, and a place to go to live, a place to have assets,\u201d he said.\u201cThey\u2019re not only securing their capital,\u201d he added, \u201cbut also their future lives.\u201dAfter Ramadan ended in July, many royals traveled to the Mediterranean. Prince Abdulaziz, the son of the late King Fahd, rode a Jet Ski this past summer off the Spanish island of Formentera within sight of his nearly 500-foot yacht.Prince Khalid, the exiled prince in Germany, said it would be difficult for the deputy crown prince, who has led the austerity drive, to squeeze his most important constituency if he wishes to reach the throne. \u201cHe won\u2019t be king without the support of the royal family,\u201d he said.Predictions that divisions within the House of Saud could jeopardize its grip on power have come and gone for decades. Despite his advancing age, King Salman emerged this month for a tour of the Persian Gulf states, a reminder of who is in charge.\u201cSwim together or sink together,\u201d he said, \u201cis ingrained in their DNA.\u201dNicholas Kulish reported from Tangier, and Mark Mazzetti from Washington. Reporting was contributed by Hugh Miles from Cairo; Ben Hubbard from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; Milan Schreuer from Paris; Iliana Magra from Mykonos, Greece; and David D.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Treasury Pick Moves in Secretive Hedge Fund Circles", "Date": "2016-12-19", "News": "Supported byAs a hedge fund manager, Goldman Sachs trader and bank chief executive, Steven T. Mnuchin has long been a member of the financial elite.Yet even on Wall Street he was not widely known before Donald J. Trump chose him to be his campaign fund-raiser last spring.Now, Mr. Mnuchin is on a path to become the first hedge fund manager to head the Treasury. As befitting that closed-door world of finance, Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s record shows a willingness to take on risks and a penchant for secrecy that members of both parties expect will be a focus of his Senate confirmation hearing.A case in point is a Delaware company that he owns, Steven T. Mnuchin Inc., whose existence has not been reported outside of official records.Mr. Mnuchin set up the company months before Goldman went public in May 1999. It had a Goldman mailing address and at least one Goldman director. It stayed that way years after he left the Wall Street bank in 2002 to start his hedge fund career.Its purpose is a mystery. The only clue is in a description on corporate filings in Delaware calling the entity an \u201cinvestment in partnerships.\u201dBarney Keller, a representative for Mr. Mnuchin, said the company \u201cheld small legacy Goldman Sachs investments\u201d and \u201chasn\u2019t made any new investments since 2002.\u201dOver the course of his career, Mr. Mnuchin, 53, has kept a low profile and has rarely granted interviews. His one previous spell in the limelight was when he ran OneWest Bank.He and other deep-pocketed investors cobbled together the California bank out of the wreckage of IndyMac, a lender that the federal government seized in 2008 as the financial crisis grabbed hold of the nation. His tenure at OneWest spurred controversy because tens of thousands of borrowers \u2014 many of them older people \u2014 were foreclosed on.When a group of protesters gathered outside his Los Angeles house in October 2011 to voice their anger at OneWest\u2019s foreclosure practices, police officers were called to disperse the crowd. He responded later by periodically scrubbing the internet of any reference to his home address to protect the privacy of his three young children, according to a filing Mr. Mnuchin made in a 2014 divorce proceeding.He is more comfortable in his own element \u2014 wealthy hedge fund managers like himself.Days after being tapped by Mr. Trump to be his finance chairman in May, Mr. Mnuchin flew out to a hedge fund conference at the Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas. There, in a swirl of rock concerts, pool parties and casino nights, he schmoozed with billionaires.Mr. Mnuchin dined with Kenneth C. Griffin, the Chicago hedge fund titan, and government veterans like David H. Petraeus, the former C.I.A. director and retired general, and John A. Boehner, the former House speaker. He shook hands with Leon Cooperman, a 73-year-old pioneer in the industry and another Goldman Sachs alumnus.It is these ties, however, that are expected to be fertile ground of investigation for senators who must confirm his selection as Treasury secretary.\u201cI think he would be controversial \u2014 former Treasury secretaries have been top bankers and businessmen or lawyers and they were well-recognized top leaders in their professions,\u201d said Prof. Richard Sylla at the Stern School of Business of New York University, whose research focuses on financial history and economics. \u201cBut Mnuchin wasn\u2019t that famous as a Goldman Sachs guy, and probably not even as a hedge fund guy, so why is he there? Well, he took the job of raising money for Trump.\u201dMr. Mnuchin shares a network with some of the biggest names in the $3 trillion hedge fund industry, but his work with Mr. Paulson is of particular interest.An adviser to Mr. Trump, Mr. Paulson, who is best known for making a $15 billion wager that the housing market would collapse, has managed some money for the president-elect.The seemingly off-the-cuff declaration was cheered by hedge fund managers and others who have bet big on the privatization of Fannie and Freddie. One of Mr. Paulson\u2019s bigger bets is that the federal government will return Fannie and Freddie to private investors largely unfettered.And Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s remark may have benefited someone else: Mr. Trump has invested $3 million to $15 million with Mr. Paulson\u2019s hedge fund, according to the financial disclosure statement filed during his run for president.To date, the Trump transition team has not commented on whether Mr. Trump continues to own stakes in Mr. Paulson\u2019s firm and other hedge funds listed on the disclosure statement. \u201cWe\u2019re not sharing any additional information at this time,\u201d said Jason Miller, a Trump representative.The president-elect has said that he will announce a plan for separating himself from his many business interests before his inauguration on Jan. 20. Similarly, Mr. Mnuchin will have to file financial disclosures with the Senate Finance Committee before his confirmation hearing. On Monday, he began the process by filing three years of tax returns.Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s time at his hedge fund, Dune Capital Management, which he formed with two former Goldman colleagues in 2004, is one area that the Senate Finance Committee is expected to examine more closely.At its peak, the firm had roughly $2 billion and was backed by the billionaire investor George Soros. It had a taste for real estate, movie financing deals and exotic investments including life insurance policies, which Dune bought through a third party at discounted prices from cash-poor older Americans.Dune had plans to package the insurance policies \u2014 called life settlements \u2014 into bonds that could be sold to investors. Life settlements represent one of the most macabre actuarial bets that Wall Street has dreamed up. It\u2019s a wager that the elderly person selling the policy will die sooner rather than later, meaning the hedge fund does not have to make many premium payments to keep the insurance policy in force and collect the payout upon that person\u2019s death.But the market for life settlements largely collapsed during the financial crisis.Eventually, Dune, like many hedge funds during the worst of the crisis, faced investor withdrawals. Mr. Mnuchin and one of his co-founding partners, Chip Seelig, decided to wind down the operation. The real estate arm of Dune was spun off into a firm led by Dune\u2019s third co-founder, Daniel M. Neidich.After the split, Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Seelig set up shop in Southern California. Both became big players in movie financing, lending money to hits like \u201cAvatar\u201d and \u201cGravity\u201d along with flops like \u201cIn the Heart of the Sea.\u201dIn late 2008, Mr. Mnuchin joined with Mr. Paulson to put together the OneWest deal. They were part of the initial round of bidding for the assets of IndyMac, which the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had seized that summer. The group, which also included Mr. Soros and other investors, won the deal with a $1.55 billion bid.One of the competing bids was put together by J. Tomilson Hill, head of the Blackstone Group\u2019s hedge fund and asset management group, and Goldman.\u201cAs a deal person, I had nothing but admiration for how entrepreneurial he was and how quickly he adapted to the circumstances,\u201d Mr. Hill said in a recent interview. He was one of the first to call Mr. Mnuchin to congratulate him on his new job as campaign finance chairman.The remnants of IndyMac reopened under the name OneWest with Mr. Mnuchin as chairman and chief executive. But controversy followed, including complaints over foreclosures on soured mortgages that IndyMac had written before the crisis. In particular, it drew scrutiny for its business in reverse mortgages \u2014 products pitched to older people who had paid off their initial mortgages but needed cash.The Department of Housing and Urban Development is investigating complaints about the foreclosure practices of OneWest\u2019s reverse mortgage business, which resulted in 16,000 foreclosures alone.An analysis in 2015 presented by the California Reinvestment Coalition, which lobbied against the merger, found that 68 percent of the 36,000 foreclosures in California by OneWest, including those on reverse mortgages, occurred in communities that were primarily nonwhite. A government filing shows OneWest offered to modify about 101,000 mortgages for its customers.Mr. Mnuchin stepped down from the helm of OneWest in March, not long before he became among the first in finance to come out for Mr. Trump and against Hillary Clinton. Mr. Keller said Mr. Mnuchin was \u201cproud of his record at OneWest.\u201dStill, the worlds of finance and politics can be small ones, and Mr. Mnuchin even has a connection to Mrs. Clinton. The in-house accountant at Goldman who prepared a tax filing for Steven T. Mnuchin Inc. many years ago has among her clients, at her current accounting firm, the former Democratic presidential candidate.Susan C. Beachy and Ciaran McEvoy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York City Should Keep ID Data for Now, Judge Rules", "Date": "2016-12-21", "News": "Supported byA key component of New York City\u2019s inclusive approach to immigrants under Mayor Bill de Blasio was on trial in a Staten Island courtroom on Wednesday.In the first arguments in a lawsuit filed this month by Ronald Castorina Jr. and Nicole Malliotakis, Republican members of the State Assembly from Staten Island, their lawyer, Jeff Alfano, said the city should be barred from destroying records associated with its municipal identification program, known as IDNYC.In the nearly two years of the program, the IDNYC card has been particularly popular with undocumented immigrants because it is a government-issued form of photo identification available to those who lack Social Security cards or driver\u2019s licenses. As prescribed by city law, records containing the personal data of the roughly one million people who have applied for the IDs were set to be destroyed by Dec. 31.But on Wednesday, Justice Philip G. Minardo of State Supreme Court on Staten Island delayed that destruction until a full hearing could be convened in the first week of January, preferably with Mr. de Blasio or Melissa Mark-Viverito, the City Council speaker, present.\u201cI don\u2019t want to order the mayor or the council speaker to be here, but it would be helpful,\u201d Justice Minardo said, issuing an unusual request.The de Blasio administration declined to comment.Mr. Castorina and Ms. Malliotakis said on Wednesday that they welcomed the judge\u2019s ruling as a small victory, an acknowledgment by the court that there were \u201cissues\u201d with destroying the documents. In their suit, they said that destroying the records would threaten national security and that the data should be preserved and made accessible under New York State\u2019s freedom of information law.Lawyers for the city argued that the state law did not cover the release of such private data. The city said on Dec. 7 that it would stop keeping personal data after new applications were approved starting next year.Justice Minardo denied a separate request to stop the destruction of the new documents being collected, at least until there could be a full hearing.While officials and lawyers wrangled over the program, cardholders and immigrant advocates said they feared that President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s administration could use the data if it moved to deport any of the estimated 11 million unauthorized residents of the country.He added: \u201cIf something were to happen with this data that led to a family getting detained or deported, then how are immigrants supposed to believe the city when it comes to providing information to the police or public schools? It took decades for the city to build this credibility.\u201dThe application does not ask applicants their immigration status. To obtain a card, an applicant can, for example, use a valid foreign passport or a consular identification, along with a utility bill that verifies a city address. An expired foreign passport is acceptable for up to three years, but the applicant may require two additional forms of proof. In addition, proof of residency in a homeless shelter for 15 days can be a form of identification.Mr. Castorina said he became alarmed in September when New York State\u2019s banking superintendent encouraged all state-licensed banks and credit unions to accept IDNYC. Only 13 banks in New York City accept the ID, and the de Blasio administration had pushed the superintendent to make such a recommendation to expand access to financial services for undocumented immigrants.\u201cIt raised concern that a person with nefarious intent or a criminal enterprise could utilize this ID to finance terror or engage in fraud,\u201d Mr. Castorina said. He and Ms. Malliotakis, the only Republicans from the city in the Assembly, sit on the chamber\u2019s banking committee.According to city records, the program had released information on only seven cardholders in response to judicial requests through Sept. 30. A total of 92 applications for IDs had been flagged as highly likely to be fraudulent, and the city had denied 7,130 applications over all because of insufficient proof of identification.At the Lower East Side People\u2019s Federal Credit Union in Manhattan, the same types of identification that can be used to apply for the IDNYC program \u2014 a consular card or a foreign passport \u2014 are accepted for opening accounts. That made it easier for the credit union to trust the city\u2019s vetting process, said Alicia Portada, the institution\u2019s marketing director.\u201cIt is not a concern if they keep the records for one year, three years or not at all,\u201d she said. \u201cAs long as they have confirmed eligibility, then that is enough for us.\u201dNisha Agarwal, the city\u2019s immigrant affairs commissioner, said officials were confident in the strength of the program\u2019s internal vetting process.Revising the policy to purge personal information immediately, she said, \u201cshows a commitment to protecting people\u2019s information and moving forward.\u201dMr. Castorina insisted that the lawsuit was \u201cnot about immigration.\u201dMs. Malliotakis, a child of Cuban and Greek immigrants, said that the records should be kept for the five years that an IDNYC card was valid and that she opposed purging records that could be useful in cases of fraud or money laundering. She said she was not aware of any such cases.Before filing their suit, Ms. Malliotakis and Mr. Castorina filed a freedom of information request in November to obtain the records for all IDNYC cardholders, which the city denied.Lawyers for the city called the suit a \u201clast-minute ploy to nullify a legislative directive and eviscerate\u201d the city\u2019s promise to protect applicants\u2019 privacy. The state\u2019s freedom of information law, the city\u2019s lawyers said, did not grant wide public access to the information of private individuals.On Tuesday, the state attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, submitted an amicus brief in support of the city, urging that state freedom of information requests \u201cnot become a mechanism for undermining governmental pledges of confidentiality.\u201dYet nobody knows how strongly the Trump administration might try to pursue the information, said Steven Choi, executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition.\u201cThat\u2019s the wild card,\u201d he said. \u201cAre they going to utilize the entire muscle of the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security to try to get this information? I think that would be a ridiculous waste of time and a terribly corrosive message to the entire country.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misspelled the surname of a New York State Assembly member. He is Ronald Castorina Jr., not Casorina.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018We\u2019re Going to Get This Done\u2019: Wisconsin Vote Recount Is Underway", "Date": "2016-12-01", "News": "Supported byELKHORN, Wis. \u2014 The basement room was cleared of pens with blue or black ink, items that could mar paper ballots. Anyone wearing a coat was told to leave it in the hallway, in case something nefarious was hidden underneath. Water bottles, purses and keys were placed on the floor, leaving the large plastic tables smooth and uncluttered.And at 9 a.m., with the brisk rap of a county clerk\u2019s wooden gavel, the first recount of the 2016 presidential election was underway in Wisconsin, with another recount pending in the neighboring battleground state of Michigan.For the next 12 days, election officials across all 72 counties in Wisconsin will work days, nights and weekends to recount nearly three million ballots, an effort initiated and financed by Jill Stein, the Green Party presidential candidate, who has suggested that voting machines in the state could have been hacked.As Wisconsin was beginning to take another look at its votes, the efforts in Michigan and Pennsylvania remained in flux.The Michigan secretary of state\u2019s office announced that Mr. Trump on Thursday objected to the recount, halting plans to begin the process on Friday. Lawyers for Mr. Trump argued that Ms. Stein did not qualify to demand a recount and that it would not be finished in time for the Electoral College, which meets on Dec. 19. The board plans to hear the objection on Friday, and if it rejects it, the recount would probably commence on Tuesday.In Pennsylvania, where Ms. Stein\u2019s efforts have more hurdles, election officials in Philadelphia said on Thursday that, pending litigation, they would begin recounting votes in 75 precincts on Friday, a small portion of the nearly 1,700 in the city. The elections commission, though, denied a request for a full forensic audit of the city\u2019s voting machines.Here in Elkhorn, a city of about 10,000 people in Walworth County in southern Wisconsin, the recount began in a government building downtown, where workers approached their task with both urgency and trepidation. They are expecting to count ballots for close to 12 hours a day until the task is complete \u2013 their deadline is Dec. 12. The Electoral College will vote on Dec. 19.\u201cWe\u2019re going to be working long hours, but we\u2019re going to get this done,\u201d said Kimberly S. Bushey, the clerk for Walworth County. When a co-worker suggested that the group would be taking a lunch break at some point, she answered with a terse \u201cMaybe.\u201dTabulators, mostly retirees, are being paid $25 for each half day they work, and county officials say they would bring in workers as needed to count the 51,000 ballots in time.In Wisconsin, recounts are not terribly unusual. Another vast statewide recount happened only four years ago, for a seat on the state\u2019s Supreme Court. The recount took more than a month.Michael Cotter, a staff member in the county clerk\u2019s office, stood on the sidelines on Thursday morning and recalled at least three other recounts that he had taken part in, dating from a countywide do-over for a judicial seat in the spring of 2000.\u201cWe had punch ballots back then, so I knew all about pregnant chads and hanging chads before Bush and Gore,\u201d he said. \u201cThey kept falling out of the ballots and they were all over the floor, like confetti.\u201dElection officials here seemed determined to keep the process orderly. Observers were told to stay several feet away from the tabulators, on one side of the room marked off by green tape. Donna Emelity, a tabulator, said she was volunteering out of a sense of civic duty. \u201cWisconsin is run very honest,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it will prove to people that it\u2019s an honest election and it\u2019ll help people have more confidence.\u201dRepresentatives of the campaigns were allowed to be closer to the process, peering over the shoulders of election officials as they tested machines and used pliers to snip open white plastic sacks of ballots.Mary Gilding, a volunteer for the Stein campaign who was there to oversee the recount, said that she did not \u201chave a dog in this fight,\u201d but merely wanted to ensure that the election results were accurate.\u201cI hope we find that there won\u2019t be anything that went wrong in our little county,\u201d Ms. Gilding said. \u201cBut with all that\u2019s going on with hacking, we need to find out for sure.\u201dMs. Stein has argued that counting by hand is more accurate than machine recounting, but lost a hearing on Tuesday that could have mandated a statewide hand count. That left the decision up to individual county clerks, who opted mostly for a hand count. A few said they were bowing to demands from people who found counting by machines to be suspicious; Walworth County officials said they would use a combination of counting by hand and feeding ballots into an optical scanner.In a statement, Ms. Stein hailed the start of the recount as a \u201ccritical first step towards restoring faith in our voting system\u201d while urging election administrators to review ballots by hand, and \u201cnot simply push a button that would repeat whatever problems may have occurred in the original tally.\u201dState Republicans have dismissed the recount as a stunt. Mr. Trump posted an angry response on Twitter about it this week.Governor Walker, a Republican, has criticized the recount. \u201cThe motivations behind the recount are questionable and ultimately costly,\u201d Tom Evenson, a spokesman, said in an email. \u201cGovernor Walker has confidence in Wisconsin\u2019s electoral process and believes it is both fair and protected.\u201dAndrea Kaminski, executive director of the League of Women Voters in Wisconsin, said she did not expect the recount to change the election results in a significant way.But she said the recount was consistent with a Wisconsin trait: \u201cthe fact that we have so darn many elections.\u201d\u201cThat reflects not so much our high level of civic participation, but the polarization that we\u2019re under right now,\u201d she said. \u201cRight now, Wisconsin is just in a lock of polarized politics where neither side is willing to compromise.\u201dSteve Eder contributed reporting from New YorkvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Outsiders Selected by Trump Aim to Unnerve Washington", "Date": "2016-12-17", "News": "Supported byThey are President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s disrupters.Seven men and one woman named by Mr. Trump to run vast government agencies share a common trait: once they are confirmed, their presence is meant to unnerve \u2014 and maybe even outright undermine \u2014 the bureaucracies they are about to lead.\u201cDonald Trump ran to make the governing people uncomfortable,\u201d said Andrew H. Card Jr., who served as chief of staff to former President George W. Bush and as transportation secretary for his father. \u201cHe clearly picked people to lead some of these departments who will be challenging to the insiders.\u201dAs Mr. Trump finishes announcing his choices for cabinet and senior White House aides, a picture is emerging of an administration with little ideological cohesion and no single animating purpose. They are neither all hard-right conservatives, nor all mainstream conservatives. They are not all insiders or outsiders. Some have known Mr. Trump for years. Others met him in the weeks since he was elected.Instead, Mr. Trump has recruited people to lead his government who can be roughly grouped into categories that appeal to the different parts of his psyche. In addition to the disrupters, there are the dealmakers, the loyalists, the establishment and the generals.Mr. Trump\u2019s administration so far reflects the people who worked for and advised him during the campaign. It is mostly men, and mostly white. Many of his picks are extraordinarily rich, though not all. Loyalty is at a premium \u2014 except when it isn\u2019t. (Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for national security adviser, was an early supporter who was rewarded. Todd Ricketts, who may become deputy commerce secretary, was a leader of the \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement.)There is \u201cno overarching theory,\u201d said Pete Wehner, who was deputy director of speechwriting for Mr. Bush and a fierce critic of Mr. Trump during the campaign. \u201cHe\u2019s not being driven by the usual impulses, which would be policy or ideology or political philosophy.\u201dHere is a look at the groups:Few things made Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign supporters roar with approval more than when he hammered the \u201cpolitical class in Washington,\u201d telling people at his rallies that the government had betrayed them, and vowing that change was coming.At many agencies, it may soon arrive. In addition to Ms. DeVos, Mr. Pruitt, Mr. Perry and Mr. Mulvaney, the disrupters include Ben Carson, chosen to lead the Housing Department; Andrew Puzder as labor secretary; Representative Tom Price of Georgia to oversee the Health and Human Services Department; and Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama as attorney general.The disrupters appear to have been picked in part for their singular ability to shake up the normal course of business at their agencies.Mr. Trump demonstrated his desire for a disruptive force when he named Mr. Pruitt to head the nation\u2019s top environmental agency. While saying that his administration \u201cstrongly believes in environmental protection,\u201d he previewed the kind of change he is looking for.\u201cFor too long, the Environmental Protection Agency has spent taxpayer dollars on an out-of-control anti-energy agenda that has destroyed millions of jobs,\u201d he said, adding that Mr. Pruitt \u201cwill reverse this trend.\u201dAs he creates an administration in his own image, perhaps no category is more natural for the author of \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d than the dealmakers.\u201cTo me, a great advantage is he knows many of the players, and he knows them well,\u201d Mr. Trump said last week during an interview about Mr. Tillerson on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cHe does massive deals in Russia. He does massive deals for the company \u2014 not for himself \u2014 for the company.\u201dMr. Mnuchin made a fortune through financial deals and now becomes the nation\u2019s top financial official. Mr. Ross, a \u201cvulture\u201d investor on Wall Street, bought nearly dead companies and made huge profits when his turnaround strategies worked.Like most future presidents, Mr. Trump has also positioned loyal, trusted aides to be close to him at the White House.Four of the loyalists \u2014 Reince Priebus, who will be White House chief of staff; Stephen K. Bannon, chief strategist; Donald F. McGahn II, White House counsel; and Mr. Flynn, national security adviser \u2014 will occupy the most coveted real estate in the West Wing.The president has also tapped Linda McMahon, the former chief executive of World Wrestling Entertainment, to oversee the Small Business Administration. Ms. McMahon has known Mr. Trump for years, long before he considered running for president. In 2007 on W.W.E., Mr. Trump took down Vince McMahon, Ms. McMahon\u2019s husband and the chairman of the organization, in what was billed as the \u201cBattle of the Billionaires.\u201dLoyalty goes only so far, however. Four of Mr. Trump\u2019s most avid supporters so far have no role in the new administration: Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey; Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker; Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas; and Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City.If there was one group Mr. Trump repeatedly derided on the campaign trail, it was the establishment.It was filled with the \u201cstupid\u201d people who ran the government poorly, Mr. Trump said. It represented the Washington swamp that he pledged to drain. When it looked like he might not win, he blamed them.But Mr. Trump hasn\u2019t shunned the establishment as he sets up his government. He has chosen Nikki Haley, the governor of South Carolina, as his envoy to the United Nations; Representative Michael Pompeo of Kansas for C.I.A. director; and Elaine Chao as his secretary of transportation.Ms. Haley, a rising star in the Republican establishment, endorsed Senator Marco Rubio of Florida during the primaries.Mr. Pompeo, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, is well-connected in the nation\u2019s capital.And there are few people who define the Republican establishment more than Ms. Chao, who, in addition to having served in cabinet posts during both Bush administrations, is married to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader.Ultimately there may be no more direct expression of Mr. Trump\u2019s psyche in his administration picks than the generals.Despite saying during the campaign that he knew more about the Islamic State than generals did, Mr. Trump is now embracing the retired leaders of America\u2019s military.Mr. Trump particularly likes \u201cMad Dog Mattis,\u201d the former Centcom commander\u2019s nickname.\u201cMad Dog Mattis!\u201d Mr. Trump said to a roar of applause at a recent rally in Fayetteville, N.C. \u201cMad Dog plays no games, right?\u201dMr. Trump called General Mattis, who led a Marine division to Baghdad during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, one of \u201cthe most effective generals that we\u2019ve had in many, many decades.\u201dMaggie Haberman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Michael Lewis, a Portrait of the Men Who Shaped \u2018Moneyball\u2019", "Date": "2016-12-03", "News": "Supported byMore than a decade ago, Michael Lewis was following a group of young baseball players through the minor leagues. He was working on a sequel to his 2003 best seller \u201cMoneyball,\u201d which chronicled how the Oakland A\u2019s general manager Billy Beane revolutionized the sport by using statistics to evaluate players.\u201cI thought I was going to show where the revolution went,\u201d he said.Mr. Lewis tracked the players for two years, but the sequel never went anywhere. By then, \u201cMoneyball\u201d had become huge \u2014 it has now sold more than 1.7 million copies \u2014 and the subject felt overexposed.So instead of tracking where the revolution went, Mr. Lewis decided to explore how it started.The inquiry led him to the work of two Israeli psychologists, Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, whose discoveries challenged long-held beliefs about human nature and the way the mind works.Mr. Lewis chronicles their unusual partnership in his new book, \u201cThe Undoing Project,\u201d a story about two unconventional thinkers who saw the world differently from everyone around them. Their peculiar area of research \u2014 how humans make decisions, often irrationally \u2014 has had profound implications for an array of fields, like professional sports, the military, medicine, politics, finance and public health.It helped explain why a simple algorithm is often better than the most experienced doctors at diagnosing stomach cancer, why so many financial experts failed to foresee the implosion of the housing market, and why professional basketball teams make costly errors when picking players \u2014 in short, why people\u2019s instincts are often so wildly wrong.In 2002, Mr. Kahneman won the Nobel in economic science, a field he had no formal training in, for demonstrating how people make decisions when faced with risks and uncertainty. (When asked if their work had any application to artificial intelligence, Mr. Tversky, who died in 1996, countered that they were more interested in exploring \u201cnatural stupidity.\u201d)When he began digging into their research, Mr. Lewis found an even more compelling story about a fertile intellectual partnership that ended too soon, when Mr. Kahneman and Mr. Tversky had a falling-out over who was receiving more credit for their discoveries.\u201cIt\u2019s a love story,\u201d Mr. Lewis said during an interview in Manhattan this fall. \u201cIt\u2019s this bromance of such great intensity, with such fertility, and the children are ideas, the children live on.\u201d\u201cThe Undoing Project,\u201d which will be released on Tuesday, seems like a departure for Mr. Lewis, whose best-known works have largely been character-driven narratives that reveal something unexpected about the way markets work. Often, they feature eccentrics and visionaries who see things that others are blind to \u2014 like Mr. Beane of the A\u2019s, or Michael Burry, the misanthropic hedge fund manager in \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d who made a fortune by betting against the housing market.\u201cThe Undoing Project\u201d centers on psychology, a field Mr. Lewis, a financial journalist who once worked as a Wall Street bond salesman, knew next to nothing about. \u201cI had cold feet about this, for very good reasons,\u201d he said.On closer inspection, though, it becomes obvious that Mr. Kahneman\u2019s and Mr. Tversky\u2019s research shaped many of the subjects that Mr. Lewis has explored, to an almost unsettling degree.\u201cDanny and Amos\u2019s work has something to say about why baseball players get misvalued, or why people can\u2019t see the value of Michael Oher in \u2018The Blind Side,\u2019 or why people can\u2019t see what mortgage-backed securities really are,\u201d he said.In a roundabout way, their work influenced Mr. Lewis\u2019s career. Their research demonstrating how people behave in fundamentally irrational ways when making decisions, relying on their gut rather than available data, gave rise to the field of behavioral economics. That discipline attracted Paul DePodesta, a Harvard student, who later went into sports management and helped upend professional baseball when he went to work for Mr. Beane.\u201cWithout their basic work, Michael Lewis doesn\u2019t get to write \u2018Moneyball,\u2019\u201d Starling Lawrence, Mr. Lewis\u2019s editor at W. W. Norton, said of Mr. Kahneman and Mr. Tversky.It is hard to imagine Mr. Lewis, 56, feeling skittish around anyone. A New Orleans native, he comes across as someone who is at ease in any situation, whether he is shadowing professional athletes and coaches, foul-mouthed derivatives traders or bigwigs at the International Monetary Fund. After studying art history at Princeton and getting a master\u2019s degree from the London School of Economics, he worked at Salomon Brothers selling bonds. He left to write \u201cLiar\u2019s Poker,\u201d his 1989 memoir about his experience on Wall Street, which he sold to Mr. Lawrence at W. W. Norton. They have worked together ever since, on more than a dozen books.Unlike many nonfiction writers, Mr. Lewis declines to take advances, which he calls \u201ccorrupting,\u201d even though he could easily earn seven figures. Instead, he splits the profits from the books, as well as the advertising and production costs, with Norton. The setup spurs him to work harder and to make more money if the books are successful, he says.\u201cYou should have the risk and you should enjoy the reward,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not healthy for an author not to have the risk.\u201dMr. Lewis\u2019s books have sold more than nine million copies, and three have been adapted into successful feature films. Norton is printing nearly 500,000 hardcover copies of \u201cThe Undoing Project.\u201dOther authors speak about him with admiration bordering on reverence.\u201cHis willingness to jump in and take on these topics that are incredibly difficult to represent on the page has always left me awe-struck,\u201d the New Yorker writer Malcolm Gladwell said in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s not a single book he\u2019s written that I thought I could have pulled off myself.\u201d\u201cThe Undoing Project\u201d \u2014 which tackles abstract concepts like utility theory, prospect theory and heuristics \u2014 may be Mr. Lewis\u2019s most arcane and ambitious undertaking to date.\u201cI don\u2019t know how you write a book about a couple of psychologists,\u201d Mr. Lawrence said. \u201cLet\u2019s just say, it\u2019s not promising in another writer\u2019s hands.\u201dWhen Mr. Lewis first met Mr. Kahneman in 2007, over coffee at Mr. Kahneman\u2019s house in Berkeley, Calif., where Mr. Lewis also lives, he had no intention of writing a book about him. Instead, he found himself offering writing advice to Mr. Kahneman, who was struggling with his own book, which laid out his theories about human cognition and decision making.\u201cHe would say, \u2018It\u2019s going to ruin my reputation. I don\u2019t know why I agreed to do this,\u2019\u201d Mr. Lewis said. \u201cAt some point I said, \u2018If you\u2019re not going to do it, I\u2019m going to write something.\u2019\u201dDespite the book\u2019s success, Mr. Lewis felt the story was incomplete. Mr. Kahneman had largely left out a huge piece of the narrative \u2014 his own biography and his complicated relationship with Mr. Tversky. Mr. Lewis continued to lobby Mr. Kahneman to let him write about their work.Mr. Kahneman was ambivalent, arguing that the book would read like a textbook. \u201cI said, \u2018You don\u2019t understand what a good character you are, and the fact that you don\u2019t understand it is part of what makes you a good character,\u2019\u201d Mr. Lewis said.It took a few years, but Mr. Kahneman finally acquiesced. \u201cHe\u2019s a pessimist, so he thought it would come out terribly,\u201d said Richard H. Thaler, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago and a longtime friend of both Mr. Kahneman and Mr. Tversky. \u201cDanny needed to be convinced and charmed, and Michael was up to the task.\u201dOver the next eight years, as he completed other books, Mr. Lewis spent countless hours with Mr. Kahneman, hiking in the hills surrounding Berkeley, traveling to Israel with him twice, and meeting at his apartment in Manhattan. He also dug through Mr. Tversky\u2019s archives and correspondence, with the help of his widow, Barbara Tversky.People close to both men, including Mr. Thaler and Ms. Tversky, say Mr. Lewis captured the intensity of their relationship and their individual quirks. Colleagues described how the pair would finish each other\u2019s sentences and could often be heard cackling from behind an office door as they wrote dense academic papers. Mr. Tversky was the bold one who delighted in undermining well-established dogma within psychology. Mr. Kahneman was cautious, sensitive and deeply pessimistic.A few of the more colorful details in the book stray from reality, said Ms. Tversky, who praised Mr. Lewis for getting the \u201cbroad strokes right.\u201d For example, Ms. Tversky disputed a delightful anecdote about how her husband was so immune to social convention that he would strip down to his underwear and run outside when he felt like getting exercise. Actually, he would on occasion run on the treadmill in his underwear, but never outside, she said.Mr. Kahneman, now 82, declined to be interviewed for this article, but offered a statement through his publisher.\u201cNaturally, there are points on which I would quibble, but this is Michael\u2019s book, not mine,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSome things in the book surprised me, some hurt, but I am glad it was written, and grateful to Michael for writing it. In the course of many conversations and countless email exchanges I came to understand the defining chapter of my life better than I had understood it before.\u201dMr. Lewis said he expected Mr. Kahneman to have a complex reaction to it.\u201cIt would be out of character for Danny just to like it, because he doesn\u2019t like much,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would not be out of character for Danny to be kind and come to terms with it in a condescending way, like, that\u2019s the best he could do, and I admire him for trying as hard as he could.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Velez did not disclose the private company\u2019s current valuation.The investment comes at a time when the broader financial technology sector in Brazil is gaining traction.Last week, the online trading platform XP Investimentos, backed by the private equity firm General Atlantic, said it had acquired Rico, another online investment platform. It paid approximately 400 million reais, or $116.7 million, according to Isaias Sznifer, a principal at Greenhill & Company in Brazil, the firm that advised Rico\u2019s founding shareholders on the deal.\u201cWe think there\u2019s a lot of interest, both from local and international players in the space, and we expect to see a number of transactions in the full spectrum of fintech in the coming 12 to 24 months,\u201d said Mr. Sznifer, a former Goldman Sachs vice president.Nubank provides a digital credit card for smartphones. It is looking to take customers away from Brazil\u2019s highly profitable banks.The start-up, based in S\u00e3o Paulo, was founded in 2013, and it rolled out its credit card in 2014.Brazil has some of the highest interest rates among emerging economies even after the country\u2019s central bank has recently begun to lower its benchmark Selic rate for the first time since 2012.The average annual interest rate for credit cards as of October was 119.7 percent, up from 97.5 percent in October 2015, according to data from Brazil\u2019s Central Bank.Nubank\u2019s monthly interest rate ranges from 2.75 percent to 14 percent, depending on a customer\u2019s credit history. Even that upper rate is lower than the average rates offered by Brazil\u2019s largest banks, according to the most recent weekly central bank data.Mr. Velez, a former Sequoia Capital partner, said the new financing was \u201ca bit more of growth capital to expand our customer base.\u201dHe said the company, which now has 392 employees, has received more than seven million applications for its card and has more than half a million people on a wait list.\u201cTo sustain our growth, we need to put the capital into systems, infrastructure, in people, and make sure we maintain really good customer service and great technology and infrastructure,\u201d he added.Nubank also faces growing competition from Brazil\u2019s traditional banks. Santander Brasil recently introduced a competing product, as did Banco CBSS, which is a joint venture between Banco Bradesco and Banco do Brasil. Bradesco has other digital initiatives as well, and Banco Itau is growing in that space.The president of Itau, Roberto Setubal, said at an event this year that fintech companies \u201crepresent a challenge and an opportunity\u201d for his and the other large banks. Last year, Itau together with Redpoint started Cubo, a co-working space for start-ups in S\u00e3o Paulo.Still, Nubank has momentum. One sign of its appeal is that it has lured multiple prominent foreign investors to make their debut investments in Brazil. The company was Sequoia Capital\u2019s first investment here.Similarly, Founders Fund\u2019s first investment in Brazil was in Nubank one year ago, even though Mr. Thiel had invested in the country through his other investment funds.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Restless Quest for a Good Night\u2019s Sleep", "Date": "2016-12-28", "News": "Supported byIf you are reading this at 3 a.m., chances are that James Proud wants to put you in a deep slumber.As the inventor of the sleep-tracking device Sense, Mr. Proud has enjoyed heady success in the quickly growing sleep tech field: Sense\u2019s 2014 Kickstarter campaign raised about $2.4 million even though the goal was only $100,000.\u201cI\u2019m fascinated by helping people live better,\u201d said Mr. Proud, 25, a British citizen who came to the United States via the Thiel Fellowship, which gives entrepreneurs $100,000 for skipping college. \u201cAnd sleep is the foundation of everything. So it\u2019s the best place to start.\u201dInsomnia and other temporary and recurring sleep disorders affect 50 million to 70 million Americans, according to the National Institutes of Health, and the effects only worsen as people grow older. Technology, while still nascent, is an alternative for those who do not want to take sleeping pills, which can be highly addictive.Like many other tech devices that monitor every twitch and turn of the human body, Sense uses sensors to collect reams of data. The information is then uploaded to a smartphone app that analyzes sleep cycles. An accelerometer about the size of a quarter attaches to a pillow and tracks tosses and turns. And a bedside hub, shaped like a ball, tracks sounds, light and temperature in a room. It glows green when sleep conditions are optimal.\u201cYou can fall into bed drunk and it still works,\u201d said Mr. Proud, a self-taught programmer.All are trying to solve an age-old problem with new technologies that experts say are still mostly unproven.Yet, experts agree that the market is huge and important. About half the United States population will have insomnia on any given night, Dr. Kline said.\u201cA huge slice of society would be interested in this technology,\u201d Dr. Kline said.The company invented a system that tracks time awake, breathing rate and number of tosses and turns through a mattress cover embedded with sensors. An app then \u201cgrades\u201d users\u2019 sleep, allowing them to adjust their sleeping habits.\u201cWe provide insight to users,\u201d said Mr. Franceschetti, a serial entrepreneur who started two clean-tech companies in the last several years. \u201cIt\u2019s partly education.\u201dEight, based in New York, now has 17 employees. It has raised $6.5 million so far from Y Combinator, Comcast Ventures, Azure Capital Partners and others.\u201cEveryone knows about nutrition and fitness,\u201d said Paul Ferris, general partner at Azure Capital Partners. \u201cSleep is the third pillar.\u201dThe rapid rise of wearable fitness trackers like Fitbit, he added, helped set up a fire hose of data that consumers could harness to track behavior.Early adopters like Alex Muir, a tech support analyst who works at a New York private school, are helping test these early sleep technologies. Last year, he contributed $199 to Eight\u2019s Indiegogo campaign, and got the company\u2019s smart cover, hub and app.\u201cEight is helping me identify what\u2019s going on with my sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s colder, I get a better night\u2019s sleep, and I can see that in the app.\u201dMr. Muir acknowledges that technology alone can\u2019t solve problems with sleep. \u201cIt can provide a baseline of information, though,\u201d he said.Some who study sleep, however, say sensors and technology do not necessarily solve the underlying problems of insomnia.\u201cSleep sensors are feeding back inaccurate information,\u201d said Hawley Montgomery-Downs, a sleep expert and an associate professor of psychology at West Virginia University. \u201cThey\u2019re telling people they sleep better than they do.\u201dAdditionally, she said, no federal regulations or standards govern the sleep tech niche.\u201cThe industry is screaming for grown-ups to come along,\u201d she said. \u201cBut sleep is sexy and lucrative. So people need to ask questions about empirical evidence for these apps.\u201dExperts add that sleep apps also collect lots of data that is not then interpreted. \u201cThe devices can show you when you\u2019re awake,\u201d Dr. Kline said. \u201cBut they don\u2019t tell you why. So the technology can\u2019t help consumers fix all their sleep problems.\u201dIn the sleep field, wearables may be the toughest sell. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to wear wearables at night because most people take technology off,\u201d said Mr. Proud, who also tried out his product, Sense, as a wearable. \u201cSilicon Valley is arrogant and gets it wrong sometimes.\u201dBarak Kassar\u2019s experience with a wearable is a case in point. When worn at night, it gathered sleep data and sent it to an app.But Mr. Kassar quickly found out that the data collected wasn\u2019t useful. He learned \u201cthat I wake up in the middle of the night, which showed up on the graph on my phone,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I already knew that.\u201d Now he wears the modernistic-looking device as jewelry.However, recent research does show that online cognitive behavior therapies can help restore sleep. After Peter Hames developed insomnia, his doctor in England prescribed sleeping pills.\u201cDrugs have had a monopoly on evidence-based health care,\u201d Mr. Hames said. Instead, he turned to a course in cognitive behavior therapy developed by an expert, which cured him in six weeks.So far, the company has raised $15 million from backers like Kaiser Permanente Ventures and Octopus Ventures, based in London. It has a 25-person team, including three clinical researchers. Clients include big employers like LinkedIn and Comcast, which pay for a year\u2019s access.\u201cWe synthesize the world\u2019s best experts,\u201d he said. \u201cOther apps have been toys, not true medicine.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hong Kong\u2019s Leader, Loyal to a Fault", "Date": "2016-12-18", "News": "Supported byWithin minutes, the news had inundated local media, and the political opposition \u2014 which won nearly 55 percent of the open seats in recent legislative elections \u2014 was cheering. Even a good part of the pro-government camp seemed to give a collective sigh of relief.Simply put, Mr. Leung has fallen out of favor because he went too far. His efforts to interpret to Beijing\u2019s advantage the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d principle, the crux of Hong Kong\u2019s relations with China, have only spurred a separatist movement and alienated even some mainstream or politically neutral Hong Kongers: They now see him as too ready to shortchange the rule of the law here in order to please the Chinese government.Mr. Leung has become too unpopular in Hong Kong to be useful to Beijing \u2014 for, yes, public opinion matters to the Chinese government, and so does preserving Hong Kong\u2019s special freedoms, which serve China\u2019s interests.Why? And why is Mr. Leung allowed to serve out his term, when Tung Chee-hwa, Hong Kong\u2019s feckless and hapless first chief executive after Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997, was made to resign unceremoniously midterm, after mass protests, invoking leg pain? Letting go of Mr. Tung early had allowed Donald Tsang, the chief secretary and second\u2013ranking official in the city, to step in as acting chief executive well ahead of the next election, giving him time to become a shoo-in. The current chief secretary, Carrie Lam, apparently is being allowed no such advantage.Since Ms. Lam is a hard-liner much in Mr. Leung\u2019s mold, Beijing may be signaling that it thinks their approach has failed and that change is in order. Perhaps taking the hint, John Tsang, the popular finance minister and the standard-bearer of a softer political line, has just resigned, suggesting an upcoming candidacy.But Mr. Leung himself is seen as having set a spark to the firewood of separatism, after having laid that out, unwittingly. He has called for \u201cfusing\u201d the two systems of the city and the mainland (\u4e2d\u6e2f\u878d\u5408) and \u201cunifying\u201d Hong Kong and Shenzhen, a major city right across the border (\u6df1\u6e2f\u540c\u57ce\u5316) \u2014 in other words, chipping away at Hong Kong\u2019s distinctiveness. In what may have been a warning, President Xi Jinping of China last year acknowledged \u201cnew developments in Hong Kong,\u201d but cautioned that, \u201cone must see to it that there be no deformation, no change in shape, in \u2018one country, two systems.\u2019 \u201dMany people here, including the politically neutral, object to such measures. When they don\u2019t want more autonomy for Hong Kong, they want the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d principle applied as it was originally conceived in the 1980s \u2014 not Mr. Leung\u2019s version. By going against the wishes of the majority and triggering a powerful backlash, Mr. Leung has committed, in the parlance of Chinese communism, the sin of ultra-leftism. Even his extraordinary efforts to remove the separatists from the local legislature could not redeem him and his associates in the eyes of Beijing.The leadership in China cannot abide the idea of independence for Hong Kong; Mr. Leung was correct about that. But neither does Beijing want Hong Kong to become more like China, and he failed to understand that. Hong Kong is far more useful to the Chinese government as it is today than if it became a glorified version of Shenzhen or Shanghai.Hong Kong\u2019s special legal status has allowed it to develop a sound regulatory framework, top-notch courts, a truly cosmopolitan professional class and a remarkably stable financial market. It remains a leading financial center, and Beijing needs the world to see China through that window. This is especially the case these days, now that Beijing\u2019s efforts to turn the renminbi into a fully convertible international currency are stalling and the U.S. government and other Western states have refused to formally recognize China as a market economy. In the end, Mr. Leung was done in by his failure to appreciate one simple thing: China still needs Hong Kong more than Hong Kong needs it.Yi-Zheng Lian is a commentator on Hong Kong and Asian affairs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Harnessing the U.S. Taxpayer to Fight Cancer and Make Profits", "Date": "2016-12-19", "News": "Supported byPublic Labs, Corporate GainsEnthusiasm for cancer immunotherapy is soaring, and so is Arie Belldegrun\u2019s fortune.Dr. Belldegrun, a physician, co-founded Kite Pharma, a company that could be the first to market next year with a highly anticipated new immunotherapy treatment. But even without a product, Dr. Belldegrun has struck gold.His stock in Kite is worth about $170 million. Investors have profited along with him, as the company\u2019s share price has soared to about $50 from an initial price of $17 in 2014.The results reflect widespread excitement over immunotherapy, which harnesses the body\u2019s immune system to attack cancer and has rescued some patients from near-certain death. But they also speak volumes about the value of Kite\u2019s main scientific partner: the United States government.Kite\u2019s treatment, a form of immunotherapy called CAR-T, was initially developed by a team of researchers at the National Cancer Institute, led by a longtime friend and mentor of Dr. Belldegrun. Now Kite pays several million a year to the government to support continuing research dedicated to the company\u2019s efforts.The relationship puts American taxpayers squarely in the middle of one of the hottest new drug markets. It also raises a question: Are taxpayers getting a good deal?Defenders say that the partnership will likely bring a lifesaving treatment to patients, something the government cannot really do by itself, and that that is what matters most.Critics say that taxpayers will end up paying twice for the same drug \u2014 once to support its development and a second time to buy it \u2014 while the company reaps the financial benefit.The debate goes squarely to one of the nation\u2019s most vexing challenges: rising health care and drug prices. Kite is one of a growing number of drug and biotech companies relying on federal laboratories. Analysts expect the company to charge at least $200,000 for the new treatment, which is intended as a one-time therapy for patients.While the law allows the government to demand drug-price concessions from its private-sector partners, the government has declined to do so with Kite and generally disdains the practice.Insisting on lower prices, federal researchers say, would drive away innovative partners that speed the drug-development process and benefit patients. But with the government doing so much pivotal research, others say that the private sector cannot afford to walk away.\u201cThe market is so reliant on the knowledge and know-how that comes out of the government and academic labs,\u201d said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, director of the Program on Regulation, Therapeutics and Law at Brigham & Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston.Price curbs, he said, \u201cwould not suddenly lead to a total abandonment of this pipeline. It couldn\u2019t possibly.\u201dDrug makers would be especially unlikely to turn away from immunotherapy, where the promising science has set off a \u201cgold rush mentality,\u201d according to Mark Edwards of Bioscience Advisors, a company which tracks pharmaceutical licensing deals.Kite executives and national health officials characterize their partnership as a model arrangement in a system established by Congress three decades ago. The system has given birth to the cancer drug Taxol, the AIDS drug Prezista, two cervical cancer vaccines and a widely used test for H.I.V. infection, among other innovations.But the government\u2019s share of any Kite success would be modest, much lower than some academic research groups have wrangled in immunotherapy deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars.Federal officials counter that the reward to the taxpayer is not money but the drug itself.\u201cThis is exactly the way things should work,\u201d said Dr. Steven Rosenberg, who has led the surgery branch at the National Cancer Institute for 42 years and led development of Kite\u2019s drug. Such partnerships, he said, are \u201cabsolutely essential or many discoveries will not see the light of day.\u201dMoreover, government officials say, companies in such deals must take significant financial risks and expenditures on their own, without any guarantee that the drug will be approved.Setting the price of the drug, Dr. Rosenberg said, \u201cis for the marketplace.\u201dLike many business deals, this one began with a personal relationship \u2014 in this case between Dr. Rosenberg and Dr. Belldegrun.After finishing medical school in his native Israel, performing surgery in helicopters for the Israeli armed forces, and completing residency at Brigham & Women\u2019s Hospital, Dr. Belldegrun became a research fellow for Dr. Rosenberg at the N.C.I. It was 1985, and Dr. Belldegrun was put to work on a new project of Dr. Rosenberg\u2019s \u2014 extracting tumor-fighting immune cells from cancer patients, multiplying them in the laboratory, and putting them back in.\u201cHe was one of the more outstanding fellows to come through,\u201d said Dr. Rosenberg, 76, who is widely considered a cancer research luminary.Kite initially thought it would pursue an approach to immunotherapy known as cancer vaccines, but in 2010, Dr. Belldegrun visited Dr. Rosenberg and was shown the X-rays of Mr. Karlson and of a second patient.Dr. Belldegrun was bowled over. \u201cI had no doubt that this is going to be a drug and, more than that, it will become a platform for multiple products,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe never looked back.\u201dOver the next two years, the National Cancer Institute worked out a deal with Kite that was signed in 2012. It was the first of eight contracts between the government and the company that generally take two forms.In one type of contract, Kite licenses patented inventions and agrees to pay the government royalties, roughly 5 percent of sales of any commercial product arising from a particular patent. However, there is no such license specifically for KTE-C19 because the underlying treatment was not patented by the N.C.I., so royalties will be minimal.Officials say the agency did not apply for a patent because the treatment was similar to what others had been developing. Also, at the time the treatment was first created, in 2007, immunotherapy was considered to have dim commercial prospects.\u201cBack then, we didn\u2019t even think about commercial aspects,\u201d said Dr. James N. Kochenderfer, a scientist at the agency who designed the treatment when working in Dr. Rosenberg\u2019s group.Under the second type of contract, known as a cooperative research and development agreement, Kite provides money to the N.C.I. to support research. Kite is now paying $3 million a year to Dr. Rosenberg\u2019s lab and has provided $7.5 million to it in total since 2012. Based on its regulatory filings, Kite is paying $7.8 million a year for research agreements and licenses in total, with at least $4 million of that going to the cancer institute and the rest to academic or corporate partners.The taxpayer has invested, too. Dr. Rosenberg estimated that the government has spent roughly $10 million over the years on what has become KTE-C19. He said Kite\u2019s $3 million a year is about equal to the taxpayer funding in that area and has helped speed research.These days, researchers from Kite and the cancer institute, typically including Dr. Rosenberg and Dr. Belldegrun, confer by conference call every other Thursday for 90 minutes. Kite employees have spent long periods at the N.C.I., learning how to manufacture the therapy and how to treat patients in advance with chemotherapy.\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t underestimate the value and the importance of N.I.H., not only to Kite but to the whole field of engineered T-cell therapy,\u201d Dr. Belldegrun said. When Kite signed its first deal with the cancer agency, he said, it \u201ctapped into six years of monumental work that they had done.\u201dSome immunotherapy competitors marvel at the company\u2019s coup in tapping into the agency\u2019s expertise. \u201cThey got 20 years of research all together in one scoop,\u201d said Dr. Carlos Paya, chief executive of Immune Design, which is pursuing a different approach.But government officials say few, if any, other companies were interested in the technology at the time Dr. Belldegrun came calling. Dr. Rosenberg said that before Kite, a few companies, including Johnson & Johnson, had looked at an earlier version of his technology but were wary because treatment involved processing each patient\u2019s cells.Kite did not get everything the cancer institute has developed in the field. Some other companies, including Opus Bio and Bluebird Bio, got rights to some products, in part because the companies had special expertise that the agency\u2019s researchers desired. But Kite seems to have gotten the balance of them and N.C.I. technology accounts for the majority of its pipeline of possible products, though the company is diversifying.Dr. Rosenberg professes no interest in the business side of the Kite relationship. He does not own stock in any company, even Kite, though he could get up to $150,000 a year in patent royalties if some of Kite\u2019s efforts pay off.Dr. Belldegrun, in contrast to his mentor, has commercial flair. He is known for his sharp business suits, lives in the Bel-Air neighborhood of Los Angeles, and seems as comfortable on Wall Street or in high society as in the operating room.Kite\u2019s relationship with the N.C.I. is an important part of its appeal to investors. In some presentations, Dr. Belldegrun has shown a photograph of himself with Dr. Rosenberg in their younger days. And he persuaded Dr. Rosenberg to speak at Kite\u2019s first big meeting for investors in June 2015, the only time he has ever spoken to Wall Street.In emails obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request by Knowledge Ecology International, Dr. Belldegrun praised Dr. Rosenberg\u2019s talk and sent him copies of investment reports from the conference written by Wall Street analysts.\u201cThank you for making the effort to come to NY,\u201d Dr. Belldegrun wrote. \u201cI heard only raving reviews about your presence and presentation.\u201dThe figures were higher for more medically important drugs: 17.4 percent had a direct public-sector patent, while 64.5 percent had at least an indirect public-sector influence.These figures are up sharply from before the 1980s. Such partnerships and licensing deals were encouraged by the 1980 Bayh-Dole and Stevenson-Wydler Acts, and the 1986 Federal Technology Transfer Act. The laws are credited with jump-starting the biotechnology industry.But from the beginning, some people questioned whether taxpayers were getting a bad deal.Perhaps the best-known drug developed from a cooperative research and development agreement \u2014 the cancer drug Taxol \u2014 was the subject of several congressional hearings in the early 1990s that investigated whether the drug\u2019s maker, Bristol-Myers Squibb, charged too much and whether the government recouped enough of its investment. In the end, the pricing was left unchanged.\u201cCompanies will not take technologies from us if we say the government will decide in the future what the price will be,\u201d said Mark Rohrbaugh, who ran the technology transfer office at the institutes from 2001 to 2013 and is now an adviser to the agency. After the \u201creasonable price\u201d clause was struck, he said, there was a threefold increase in partnership deals.The N.I.H. can collect royalties from successful products to help offset the costs of the research, but so far these royalties have been small, amounting to an estimated $135 million in the last fiscal year from 870 licenses, with the bulk of the money coming from a small number of drugs.\u201cWe\u2019re not preoccupied with financial value,\u201d Dr. Rohrbaugh said. \u201cOur mission is treatment of people and improving public health.\u201dIn that regard, the government\u2019s bet on a small company like Kite, which might have seemed risky, appears to be paying off so far. Dr. Belldegrun has largely delivered on promises to raise money, assemble an experienced staff, build the factory, conduct clinical trials and begin to apply for regulatory approval. Once considered the underdog to Novartis and Juno, Kite might be the first reach the market.Academic centers and companies often drive harder bargains in licensing technology. In some cases, academic centers own a stake in a company they license technology to, allowing them to reap a financial windfall if the company does well. Both the Hutchinson cancer center and Sloan Kettering have owned stock in Juno and are entitled to substantial payments \u2014 up to $350 million and $150 million \u2014 if Juno\u2019s stock reaches certain levels.The N.I.H. does not take equity positions in companies to avoid an appearance of a conflict of interest. So to critics of the government deals, drug prices are crucial to understanding taxpayer value. After all, they ask, is a drug truly widely available \u2014 which is what the government says is its measure of success \u2014 if it costs too much for some people?Rachel Sachs, an associate law professor at Washington University in St. Louis and expert in innovation policy, said the government had every right to seek price concessions. She noted that the government, through Medicare and Medicaid, was effectively buying its inventions back from itself. \u201cThe public is paying for the research and to the extent that many people, if not most, will pay through public insurance, we\u2019re paying again,\u201d she said.One mechanism to control pricing already exists. It is called march-in rights, and it lets the N.I.H. take back control of a patent on an invention made with federal funding if the drug is not being made available to the public on reasonable terms. The tool has gone unused.U.C.L.A. made more than $500 million by selling its royalty rights to the drug. But the N.I.H. declined to exercise its march-in rights on Xtandi, arguing that it was not qualified to judge whether a drug\u2019s price is reasonable and that a high price does not mean a drug is not being made available to the public.\u201cN.I.H. has made it clear that its job is not to decide prices of drugs, period,\u201d Dr. Rohrbaugh saidKite says it has not decided what to charge for KTE-C19, but Dr. Belldegrun hinted that Kite\u2019s therapy might be relatively expensive because ideally it would be a single treatment that would cure the patient, not a drug that would have to be taken continuously. He added that Kite would take steps to make sure that everyone who needed the drug could get it.Meantime, the relationship between Kite and the National Cancer Institute is expanding to develop treatments for other cancers, including one technique Dr. Rosenberg thinks could be used to attack solid tumors like colon, breast and lung cancer.\u201cThe potential for broad applicability is huge,\u201d he said.That could mean many lives saved and maybe more billion-dollar drugs for Kite and its investors, with the American taxpayer right in the middle of the deal.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jack Rudin, Patriarch of Family of New York Developers, Dies at 92", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byJack Rudin, the patriarch of a family that has been developing New York real estate for five generations and the benefactor of the city\u2019s first five-borough marathon, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 92.The cause was pneumonia, his son, Eric, said.They persuaded fellow property owners to prepay real estate taxes to replenish the city\u2019s depleted coffers and founded the Association for a Better New York, which continues to promote civic pride. In the cutthroat world of New York real estate, the Rudins were an anomaly: They gave landlords a good name.\u201cThe Rudins exemplify a uniquely New York reality that success is much more about what you give than what you make,\u201d said Kathryn Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, a leading business organization.Eric Rudin, the president of Rudin Management, which owns and operates more than 15 million square feet of commercial and residential space, said his father \u201chated the word \u2018landlord,\u2019 with all its negative connotations.\u201dHe added: \u201c\u2018Developer\u2019 may not be as bad a word, but in his mind, developers were just interested in turning over properties whereas our family built rental apartment and office buildings and never wanted to sell.\u201dJack Rudin preferred to be known as an \u201cowner\u201d and a \u201cbuilder,\u201d his son said.\u201cThey had a very unique partnership \u2014 different styles but a mind meld on major decisions,\u201d said Lewis Rudin\u2019s son, William C. Rudin, the chief executive of Rudin Management. \u201cMy dad was the leasing and financing and the external guy, and Jack was the builder running the day-to-day business who\u2019d love to get his shoes dirty on construction sites.\u201dJack Rudin oversaw the design and construction of, among other buildings: an office tower at 345 Park Avenue in Manhattan that occupies a full block bordered by 51st and 52nd Streets and Lexington Avenue; 1 Battery Park Plaza, in the Financial District; and 3 Times Square, housing Thomson Reuters at 42nd Street. He was president and then chairman of Rudin Management.Lewis was indisputably more gregarious, but Jack, typically in partnership with his brother, was similarly civic-minded and philanthropic.In 1976, Percy Sutton, the Manhattan borough president, was seeking a display of civic promotion for the nation\u2019s bicentennial. At the suggestion of the public relations agent Mortimer Matz and others, Mr. Sutton proposed to Fred Lebow, the president of the New York Road Runners Club, that the New York City Marathon be expanded from Central Park to all five boroughs.Mr. Lebow balked because of the logistics and the expense, which he estimated at $20,000 (about $85,000 in today\u2019s dollars). The Rudins offered $25,000. Their request that the trophy be named for their father, Samuel, a marathoner, was granted. They enlisted Manufacturers Hanover as another financial supporter and persuaded Mayor Abraham D. Beame to cut red tape.The Rudin family remains a major sponsor of the marathon.Jacob Rudin (he was always known as Jack and legally changed his name as an adult) was born on June 28, 1924, in the Throgs Neck section of the Bronx. His mother, the former May Cohen, became a philanthropist. His father was the son of a grocer, Louis Rudinsky, a Jewish immigrant from Poland who was the first in the family to own property in Manhattan.In 1902, Jack\u2019s grandfather bought a parcel on 54th Street as an investment because he had heard that the Rockefellers lived down the block (but on the other side of the street). The family retained the property and eventually built a 32-story office building on the site.The Rudins moved from the Bronx to Manhattan. Jack graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School and briefly attended City College before enlisting in the Army in 1942. After serving in Europe in the 89th Infantry Division and being awarded the Bronze Star, he was discharged as a staff sergeant, returned home in 1946 and joined the family real estate business.His wife, the former Roberta Chait, died in 1983. In addition to their son, he is survived by his wife, the former Susan Salesky; two daughters, Madeleine Rudin Johnson and Katherine Rudin; two stepdaughters, Inda Schaenen and Eve Schaenen; three grandsons; and five stepgrandchildren.Mr. Rudin was often called on by mayors and governors to serve on commissions studying a range of issues, including homelessness and school maintenance, and the family had a reputation for granting more favors than it requested.The Rudins, Shelby White wrote in The New York Times in 1998, are \u201cthought of by some as the ultimate honorees because they can be counted on to call a seemingly endless supply of people with whom they do business (accountants, electricians, even their elevator company).\u201dIt was also no coincidence that at some point after their terms expired and they had to leave Gracie Mansion, the official residence, former Mayors John V. Lindsay, Mr. Beame, Edward I. Koch and David N. Dinkins all knocked on the Rudins\u2019 door to find apartments in Rudin buildings.Above all, Mr. Rudin was a builder, and a utilitarian one. Defending a proliferation of ascetic white-brick facades derided by architecture critics, he declared that \u201cusability comes first, layout is everything\u201d and added: \u201cWe are manufacturers of apartment buildings. We have to price apartments so they will rent. What good is having an architectural monument that doesn\u2019t rent?\u201dAnd as a builder, he followed the adage \u201cMeasure twice and cut once.\u201dIn 1995, when he was 71, he was admitted to a hospital for hip replacement surgery. He recalled: \u201cBefore the surgery, I had my wife draw two targets on my hips in lipstick. The one on the right said, \u2018Enter.\u2019 And the one on the left said, \u2018Do not enter.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

Lloyds also said its market share in the British credit card market would rise to more than a quarter from 15 percent, a level that would bring it closer to Barclays, the largest provider of credit cards in Britain with a share of nearly 30 percent.The deal culminates years of upheaval and reorganization at the bank, which the British government bailed out in the middle of the 2008 global financial crisis. The British government at one point owned more than 40 percent of Lloyds.Lloyds returned to a profit in 2014 and paid its first dividend since its bailout last year. The government now owns less than 7 percent of Lloyds after announcing plans in October to resume sales of its shares.The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of the first half of 2017 and is subject to regulatory approval.Lloyds said the deal is expected to increase its revenue by \u00a3650 million a year.

Until 1926, Zinder was Niger\u2019s capital. Then it ran low on water.Early one gray-yellow morning, I set off from Zinder for a village called Chana, the home of one of the migrants I had met, Habibou Idi. Rows upon rows of millet grew on both sides of the two-lane national highway, punctuated occasionally by a spindly acacia. About an hour outside the city, some boys were raking the soil, yanking out weeds.Early one gray-yellow morning, I set off from Zinder for a village called Chana, the home of one of the migrants I had met, Habibou Idi.

{"Headline": "Saudis Bankroll Taliban, Even as King Officially Supports Afghan Government", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 Fifteen years, half a trillion dollars and 150,000 lives since going to war, the United States is trying to extricate itself from Afghanistan. Afghans are being left to fight their own fight. A surging Taliban insurgency, meanwhile, is flush with a new inflow of money.With their nation\u2019s future at stake, Afghan leaders have renewed a plea to one power that may hold the key to whether their country can cling to democracy or succumbs to the Taliban. But that power is not the United States.It is Saudi Arabia.Saudi Arabia is critical because of its unique position in the Afghan conflict: It is on both sides.A longtime ally of Pakistan, Saudi Arabia has backed Islamabad\u2019s promotion of the Taliban. Over the years, wealthy Saudi sheikhs and rich philanthropists have also stoked the war by privately financing the insurgents.All the while, Saudi Arabia has officially, if coolly, supported the American mission and the Afghan government and even secretly sued for peace in clandestine negotiations on their behalf.The dual tracks allow Saudi officials plausibly to deny official support for the Taliban, even as they have turned a blind eye to private funding of the Taliban and other hard-line Sunni groups.The result is that the Saudis \u2014 through private or covert channels \u2014 have tacitly supported the Taliban in ways that make the kingdom an indispensable power broker.In interviews with The New York Times, a former Taliban finance minister described how he traveled to Saudi Arabia for years raising cash while ostensibly on pilgrimage.The Taliban have also been allowed to raise millions more by extorting \u201ctaxes\u201d by pressing hundreds of thousands of Pashtun guest workers in the kingdom and menacing their families back home, said Vali Nasr, a former State Department adviser.Yet even as private Saudi money backed the Taliban, Saudi intelligence once covertly mediated a peace effort that Taliban officials and others involved described in full to The Times for the first time.Playing multiple sides of the same geopolitical equation is one way the Saudis further their own strategic interests, analysts and officials say.But it also threatens to undermine the fragile democratic advances made by the United States in the past 15 years, and perhaps undo efforts to liberalize the country.The United States now finds itself trying to persuade its putative ally to play a constructive rather than destructive role. Meanwhile, the Afghans have come to view Saudi Arabia as both friend and foe.The question now, as Afghan officials look for help, is which Saudi Arabia will they get?Prince Turki al-Faisal, who led the Saudi intelligence agency for over 24 years and later served as ambassador to the United States until his retirement in 2007, rejected any suggestion that Saudi Arabia had ever supported the Taliban.\u201cWhen I was in government, not a single penny went to the Taliban,\u201d he wrote in emailed comments.Others say the verdict is still out. \u201cWe know there has been this financing that has gone on for years,\u201d Hanif Atmar, director of the Afghan National Security Council, said in an interview. \u201cThis sustains the terrorist war machine in Afghanistan and in the region, and it will have to be stopped.\u201dThat may be easier said than done. Saudi Arabia remains one of the main sources of what Secretary of State John Kerry recently called \u201csurrogate money\u201d to support Islamist fighters and causes.Much of that largess is spread about in pursuit of what Mr. Nasr describes as a Saudi strategy of building a wall of Sunni radicalism across South and Central Asia to contain Iran, its Shia rival.That competition is being rekindled. With the Americans leaving, there is the sense that Afghanistan\u2019s fate is up for grabs.In recent months, the Taliban has mounted a coordinated offensive with about 40,000 fighters across eight provinces \u2014 a push financed by foreign sources at a cost of $1 billion, Afghan officials say.At the same time, Saudi Arabia is offering the Afghan government substantial defense and development agreements, while Afghans say sheikhs from Saudi Arabia and other Arab Persian Gulf states are quietly funneling billions in private money to Sunni organizations, madrasas and universities to shape the next generation of Afghans.\u201cThe Saudis are re-engaging,\u201d said Mr. Nasr, now dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, in a telephone interview. \u201cAfghanistan is important to them, which is why they invested so much in the 1980s, and they are looking to make themselves much more relevant.\u201dThe seven-year Taliban theocracy in Afghanistan was coming to a fiery end. It was 2001, and the Taliban government was collapsing under United States bombing unleashed in retaliation for the Sept. 11 attacks.In the Pakistani border town of Quetta, he and other Taliban leaders regrouped and began organizing the insurgency that continues today. Mr. Motasim was appointed head of the finance committee.One of his first stops was Saudi Arabia.As home to both enormous oil wealth and Islam\u2019s holiest sites, it was the perfect place to make appeals not only to rich Saudi sheikhs and foundations but also to important donors who traveled to the kingdom on pilgrimage from all over the Muslim world.Between 2002 and 2007, Mr. Motasim traveled to Saudi Arabia two or three times a year. Ostensibly he went on pilgrimage, but his primary purpose was to raise cash for the Taliban.\u201cThere were people coming from other countries for umrah and hajj,\u201d he said referring to the different Muslim pilgrimages. \u201cAlso the Saudi sheikhs would come as well. I would ask them for their help for the war.\u201d\u201cIt was not only the Saudis who would help us but people who would come from different countries,\u201d he recalled. \u201cSaudi Arabia was the only country where I could meet them.\u201dOnce secured, the money could be moved in myriad ways to Taliban coffers, officials said, including through regional banks near Pakistan\u2019s tribal areas and the hawala system of informal money-changers.Last year, Afghan security forces even discovered families of Al Qaeda members entering eastern Afghanistan with a stash of gold bars, Rahmatullah Nabil, former head of Afghanistan\u2019s intelligence agency, the National Directorate of Security, said.The Saudi authorities often say they cannot control or always identify the millions of Muslims who travel to the kingdom every year on the hajj, said Barnett Rubin, who worked as special adviser to the United States envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan.The Taliban always traveled on fake Pakistani passports under assumed names and were unknown to Saudi authorities, said a security official in the region, who spoke on condition of strict anonymity, citing the extreme sensitivity to upsetting Saudi Arabia.American requests to cut the funding yielded little result.In 2009, American officials complained that the Taliban and other extremist groups were raising millions of dollars during annual pilgrimages, according to American diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks.The cables date from a period when Richard C. Holbrooke, who died in 2010, acted as special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, and actively sought to curb funding to the Taliban and Al Qaeda.The funding from the gulf extended well beyond that period and to other groups besides the Taliban, including the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.It was September 2008, the holy month of Ramadan, and King Abdullah was hosting an iftar dinner in Mecca. But this was no routine breaking of the fast at sunset.The feast was an important signal of the king\u2019s personal support for a covert yet still evolving peace effort. Among the dozens of guests were Afghan officials and elders, as well as former Taliban members.Within months, at a more discreet venue in the Red Sea port of Jidda, the Saudi intelligence agency convened Afghanistan\u2019s chief adversaries to hash out a peace deal.Mr. Motasim, the same man who had been collecting money for the insurgency, was named by the Taliban as its representative.On the other side, the emissary for President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan was his brother, Qayum Karzai.During three days of intense discussions \u2014 breaking at intervals when the men locked horns \u2014 a Saudi intermediary nudged the two sides forward.The peace effort had begun in 2006. The initial broker was Abdullah Anas, an Algerian who had won credibility by fighting the Soviets for 10 years in Afghanistan.In an interview, Mr. Anas said his decision to seek out the Saudis as a third-party mediator was obvious, because of the kingdom\u2019s special status as home to Islam\u2019s two holiest sites and its support during the fight against the Soviet occupation.\u201cEven in a very far village in Afghanistan, Saudi means something,\u201d said Mr. Anas, who today runs Al Magharibia, a satellite television channel based in London.Still, getting the Saudis on board took some persuading. The events of 9/11 had deeply embarrassed them.Both the kingdom and the United States had nurtured the mujahedeen to push out a Soviet occupation in the 1980s, but the subsequent behavior of the Taliban infuriated the Americans. Harboring Osama bin Laden was the last straw.For the Saudis, it was more complicated.Saudi Arabia supported the Taliban government up to 2001 and beyond, in alignment with Pakistan, the kingdom\u2019s main ally to check Iranian influence in the region.\u201cThe problem is Saudi Arabia sees Afghanistan through the lenses of Pakistan,\u201d Mr. Anas said, describing a prime challenge of his peace initiative.To achieve peace, Mr. Anas said he wanted to encourage the Saudis to build a relationship with Afghanistan directly.People involved in the effort \u2014 who spoke on condition of anonymity because the process was conducted in confidentiality \u2014 say King Abdullah was moved to back the effort out of a sense of compassion.He did so, they said, even in the face of resistance from other Saudi royals who were unhappy with the American occupation. Yet others were wary of further involvement in Afghanistan.To overcome Saudi reluctance, Mr. Anas took the Saudi emissary to Afghanistan to show that it remained a freely practicing Muslim society, despite the presence of American troops. President Karzai wrote King Abdullah, who had ascended to the throne in August 2005, a deferential letter requesting his intercession. It worked.King Abdullah met the Afghan leader at the door of his plane on a pilgrimage visit. Mr. Karzai still speaks highly of his friendship with King Abdullah, who died in 2015.\u201cHe would never, never, never leave my call unanswered,\u201d he recounted in an interview. \u201cThe same day he would get back to me, talk to me and do all that I asked.\u201dThe Saudi intelligence chief, Prince Muqrin bin Abdul Aziz, personally oversaw the negotiations, sending his emissary between Mr. Motasim of the Taliban and the Afghan government for two years.But when talks neared a critical endpoint, the Taliban were gripped by a vicious power struggle. The Saudi demand that the Taliban renounce terrorism and its ties to Al Qaeda was never met. Mr. Motasim was accused of embezzlement and removed.The next year, 2010, his main protector, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the Taliban\u2019s chief operational commander, was arrested in Pakistan, while an assassin shot Mr. Motasim and left him for dead outside his home in Karachi, though he survived.Both events were interpreted as Pakistan\u2019s opposition to any peace process being negotiated without its participation, several of those involved in the process say.\u201cIt was then that this process was sabotaged,\u201d Mr. Motasim said.King Abdullah intimated to President Karzai in 2010 that there were obstructions beyond his control.\u201cI wish to help Afghanistan,\u201d Mr. Karzai recalled the king\u2019s saying. \u201cI want it to be peaceful, I want you to sit down and talk to the Taliban, but you must recognize that all I can do is what Saudi can do.\u201cThat was a very meaningful word,\u201d Mr. Karzai concluded, \u201cmeaning that there were other forces who were probably not willing to allow this to happen.\u201dDespite those covert efforts, the Saudi kingdom, publicly and officially, has been largely absent in Afghanistan. While paying lip service to the American mission, Saudi Arabia has not built a significant project in its own name in Afghanistan in 15 years.Yet official Saudi neglect stands in stark contrast to the wealth of private Saudi funding that has done more than bolster the Taliban and allied militant groups in the region.It has also spawned hundreds of universities, madrasas and radical groups that have extended Sunni influence and that Afghans fear are sowing seeds of future turmoil.One of those Afghans is Nisar Karimzai, who runs a small research office, the Organization for Research of Peace and Stability.During the Soviet occupation, Mr. Karimzai went to school in Pakistan, where he fell in with a Sunni extremist crowd. \u201cThey teach that the Shia are not Muslim,\u201d he recalled, referring to Shiites.He eventually discarded extremist thinking. But his own experience made him wary when he saw a cousin become involved with an Islamist group called Jamiat Eslah.\u201cI recognize the way they are training them,\u201d Mr. Karimzai said. \u201cIt was exactly the same way they taught me.\u201cPersonally I am scared,\u201d Mr. Karimzai added. \u201cIn five years we will face a danger from them. One day they will fight and we will have a very big problem.\u201dJamiat Eslah promotes a strict Islamist worldview and describes itself as a self-financed, nonpolitical organization focused on humanitarian and educational work.But the size of its operations, with 40 to 50 buildings including offices, a university and a hospital, indicates substantial outside funding, said Mr. Nabil, a former head of Afghan intelligence.The group\u2019s bank accounts show no foreign bank transfers, according to an internal government report. Nevertheless, the report concluded that the group is financed by sources in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.The group is just one of a proliferating number that have sprouted in recent years as Sunni Arabs from the Persian Gulf compete with Shiite Iran for influence here.The Iranians, too, have been busy building madrasas, universities and cultural centers for the Shiite population, and even a road to the border with Iran.The rivalry underlying the scale of such competing funding, Afghan officials and others warn, spells trouble. In 2001, Afghanistan had just 1,000 madrasas. Today, there are more than 4,000, the majority of them built in the last few years.Hajji Abdul Qahar Abed, who serves as chief of staff to the chief executive of the government, Abdullah Abdullah, warns that after decades of war and dislocation, Afghans are particularly vulnerable.\u201cMy personal fear is that their associates will lead them somewhere that will hurt the people again,\u201d he said of Jamiat Eslah.Another youth movement gaining traction is Hisb ut-Tahrir, a secretive, anti-establishment group that has a wide underground following in Central Asia, according to several government officials.Officials and former insiders of the group said they believed it was funded by foreigners including Saudis and other gulf Arabs, as well as donors in Egypt and Europe.\u201cThey want to reach as many people as they can and bring them into the party and eventually strengthen their ranks and announce a caliphate,\u201d said Massoud Rahimi, a student at Kabul University, who said he declined when a cousin tried to recruit him.\u201cIt is going to put Afghanistan on the road of conflict,\u201d he said.Upon his election 2014, Afghanistan\u2019s current president, Ashraf Ghani, chose Saudi Arabia for his first official trip. Then five months later, after a second trip to meet the new Saudi king, Salman bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud, Mr. Ghani pledged Afghan support for the Saudi military coalition for Yemen.In return, Mr. Ghani wanted Saudi Arabia\u2019s rulers to stop the flow of funds from rich Saudi sheikhs to the Taliban and encourage the Taliban back into negotiations.\u201cThe signs are positive,\u201d said Mr. Atmar of the National Security Council. \u201cWe have not yet seen concrete movements against this, but we believe that we have a strong commitment.\u201dYet other Afghan officials and local diplomats are deeply skeptical.One diplomat in Kabul said tracking the flow of illegal money was virtually impossible. Another, who had served in Saudi Arabia, doubted that Riyadh would change, adding that the vast royal family is split into fiefs often working at odds with each other.The scale of the Taliban\u2019s recent offensive also has left many Afghans wary.\u201cThe level of finance, the level of logistical support in terms of weapons and other materials, and the level of organizational support in terms of leadership of the war they have received is unprecedented,\u201d said Nader Nadery, chief adviser on strategic affairs to the president.\u201cIt clearly indicates a declared war against Afghanistan,\u201d he added, accusing Pakistan, the stalwart Saudi ally.Mr. Abdullah, Afghanistan\u2019s chief executive, recently led a delegation to Saudi Arabia. They went seeking investment, but also asked Saudi leaders to press Pakistan to end its safe haven for terrorists, a request President Karzai also made repeatedly.\u201cThey said they will do that, and they said they will try in the gulf region to use their influence to mobilize against terrorism,\u201d said Nasrullah Arsalai, director general of the council of ministers secretariat in Afghanistan, who was part of the delegation.Yet Ruhullah Wakil, a tribal elder who is now a member of the Afghan peace council says he, too, recently beseeched Saudi officials to sponsor the work of the council, which is authorized to pursue negotiations.The Saudis were uninterested.\u201cThey are deaf,\u201d he said. \u201cWe asked them to help. We asked them even just to give us some dates to serve to guests.\u201cBut they gave us nothing.\u201dRuhullah Khapalwak contributed reporting from Kabul.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Christmas Request, Answered a Century Later", "Date": "2016-12-20", "News": "Supported byThe stonecutter walked along Row F of a section of Mount St. Mary Cemetery in Flushing, Queens, and stopped at Grave 108, marked with a modest gray granite headstone.He held a stencil bearing the words \u201cLoving Wife Mary\u201d and the years 1897 and 1979, which frame the life of Mary McGahan, loving wife of George McGahan.The couple was childless, and according to cemetery records, both were buried here. But for whatever reason, Mary\u2019s name was never added to the headstone under that of her husband when she died three years after him.This bothered Peter Mattaliano, 67, an acting coach and screenwriter, who is not related to Ms. McGahan and never even knew her.Mr. Mattaliano visited the grave at that time and was upset to see the gravestone lacking her name. He murmured a graveside promise to Mary that he would be back to remedy this.Last week, he was back, with the stonecutter, who laid the stencil across the headstone and used a sandblaster to carve her name into granite permanence, 37 years after her death.When Mr. Mattaliano moved into the fourth-floor apartment at 447 West 50th Street in 1999, the fireplace had long been bricked shut. Renovating it, he found Mary\u2019s letter, along with one from her little brother, Alfred.Alfred had written to Santa asking for a drum and a hook-and-ladder fire truck. Mary\u2019s was more touching, hinting at the family\u2019s poverty and her selflessness even at age 10.She wrote asking Santa for a wagon for her brother \u201cwhich I know you cannot afford,\u201d and for herself \u201csomething nice what you think best.\u201d She signed off with the request: \u201cP.S. Please do not forget the poor.\u201dMr. Mattaliano was haunted by that reminder from a poor girl who requested a wagon for her brother first and nothing specific for herself.\u201cFor somebody to show that kind of humanity at that early age,\u201d he said. \u201cI just could not stand to see her be forgotten.\u201dHe would later learn from historical records that the siblings\u2019 father had died abruptly and that they were being raised by their mother. She was a dressmaker who, records indicated, had given birth to three other children who did not survive infancy.He found that Mary was born Mary McGann and wound up marrying the similarly named George McGahan, and that both of her parents wound up buried in Calvary Cemetery in Queens, in unmarked graves.All of this hit home for Mr. Mattaliano, a bachelor with no children. He was 12 when his own father died. He and his three brothers saw some lean Christmases along with their mother in their Jersey City apartment.He had the letters to Santa framed and began displaying them year-round above the fireplace. Every December, he honors Mary and Alfred by putting up Christmas decorations and laying out their presents: a fire truck for him and a doll for her.\u201cI\u2019m sharing their space,\u201d he said, of their continued presence in his apartment.Over the years he wrote and polished a whimsical Christmas-themed movie script based on the letters. He has assembled a production team and is speaking to investors to finance the film, which he calls \u201cPresent From the Past.\u201dVisiting Ms. McGahan\u2019s grave last December, Mr. Mattaliano planted a small tree near the grave and then patted the grave and promised that, \u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201dCemetery staff members told him that to add her name, he needed permission from the buyer of the plot (who is deceased) or a relative (he could find none).Then he heard from a distant cousin of Mary\u2019s, a man living in Ireland who read about Mr. Mattaliano\u2019s story in an Irish newspaper article.The cousin, Brian Dempsey, 56, a schoolteacher from County Kildare, agreed to send Mr. Mattaliano a notarized letter granting permission to add Ms. McGahan\u2019s name. He also sent a bag of soil he scooped from a field near the small farm in Lullymore where Mary\u2019s mother grew up before emigrating.Even with the letter, Mr. Mattaliano still had problems getting the cemetery\u2019s permission. For help, he contacted Michael Lewis, who owns an established monument company in Queens, but by early December, it still seemed that yet another Christmas would pass with Ms. McGahan\u2019s going unacknowledged in her grave.Then, a bit of holiday magic happened: the Metropolitan Cemetery Association held its annual holiday luncheon in a catering hall on Jericho Turnpike, a few miles from Ms. McGahan\u2019s grave site.A board member of the group, Jan Neuman, had enjoyed The Times story and had invited Mr. Mattaliano to the meeting to share the story with his members.Mr. Mattaliano attended and, with the timing of a seasoned acting coach, told the story of the little girl\u2019s big-hearted letter to Santa and where that girl wound up. Then he paused, and decided to plead his case in the room filled with cemetery officials.A hand shot up. It belonged to Stephen Comando, executive director of Catholic Cemeteries, associated with the Diocese of Brooklyn, which includes Mount St. Mary Cemetery. The group was unaware of the difficulty, Mr. Comando said.The necessary approvals were obtained and within two weeks, Mr. Mattaliano was smiling as the stonecutter finished engraving \u201cLoving Wife Mary\u201d into the granite.Mr. Mattaliano knelt at the gravestone and sprinkled the small bag of Irish soil in front of it.\u201cEven if there\u2019s no family to visit,\u201d he said, \u201cat least she\u2019ll be acknowledged.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Ms. Jackson and Ms. Neal sleep in twin beds in the bedroom, and share a vanity and a bench when they get ready in the morning, to avoid hogging the bathroom.For the male roommates, the group installed a T-shaped wall in the living room, dividing it into two bedrooms, leaving space for a kitchen table in a common area. Mr. Morgan and Mr. Bell have hardly any privacy; building regulations require the bedroom walls to stop about two feet shy of the ceiling. \u201cYou can hear everything,\u201d Ms. Jackson said.While they live in dormlike conditions, Ms. Jackson and her roommates are not in college anymore. They are gainfully employed 20-somethings, trying their hardest to make living in New York City affordable. Each pays under $1,000 a month, toward a total rent of $3,750. Moving to another borough would afford the foursome much more space for less money, of course, but like many newcomers, they are willing to make certain sacrifices to stay in Manhattan.Like many luxury buildings, theirs required that they use an approved temporary wall company to create the extra bedrooms, and the partition cost them over $1,000, Ms. Jackson recalled. This didn\u2019t include doors, which the building would have allowed, but the roommates decided the added costs, including installation, were too much. They had hoped to eventually install doors themselves, as well as fill the gap between the top of the new wall and the ceiling, but design solutions have so far eluded them.The situation is not uncommon. When it comes to finding a safe, convenient place to live, young professionals confront one of the harshest realities of New York City real estate: It\u2019s almost impossible to live in a nice apartment \u2014 and still have enough money to dine out occasionally \u2014 without tacking on a few more bedrooms, adding more roommates and relinquishing some privacy.According to a spokesman for the Department of Buildings, a permit is required whenever there is a change in the layout of an apartment. For large rental buildings, landlords are required to have a registered architect or professional engineer submit the plans to the buildings department, and should not install the wall until a permit is issued.These regulations are difficult to enforce and are often ignored, since the buildings department does not perform random inspections.Sara Goldman and her roommates inherited a system of temporary walls that turned a one-bedroom into a three.\u201cThe most common thing I see is they build the wall a foot beneath the ceiling,\u201d said William Aronin, a lawyer who focuses on real estate litigation. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly the code of the law. It\u2019s just how things work in New York City.\u201d These types of temporary walls often cut interior spaces off from natural light, but leaving the gap at the top, at least in theory, allows a kind of access.Dave Delaney, 34, knew the compromises required by a jerry-built bedroom all too well. In his early 20s, he lived for five years with three buddies in a two-bedroom apartment on East 57th Street and Third Avenue. The group divided the living room into three bedrooms, two of which faced the windows while a third (his bedroom) faced the apartment\u2019s interior. One of the real bedrooms was used as a living room; the other was taken by the fourth roommate, who paid extra for it.\u201cIt was brutal,\u201d Mr. Delaney said. \u201cYou could literally hear a pin drop in another room. It turned into us all having to go to bed at the same time. It was basically like we were living in the same room but we couldn\u2019t see each other.\u201dBecause he had no window and no ventilation, it got so hot in Mr. Delaney\u2019s room that he had to keep his door wide open at night. When it became unbearable, he bought a portable air-conditioner and carved a hole in his wall for the exhaust hose. The common areas would heat up, but Mr. Delaney\u2019s room was perfectly chilled.Now, Mr. Delaney lives in Los Angeles with his wife, and is preparing to move back to New York for his business, a trucking insurance company. A fake wall is no longer an option. He believes those kinds of living situations are best suited for young professionals.\u201cI think you\u2019re just at a point in your life \u2014 at least I was \u2014 where you\u2019re working a lot, you\u2019re staying out late, and you\u2019re going out a ton,\u201d he said. \u201cLiving at home wasn\u2019t really a big deal. It was just the place you went to sleep.\u201dSara Goldman, a paralegal, and her two roommates were fortunate enough to inherit already-installed partitions that stop just short of the ceiling, thus avoiding a hefty expense. \u201cIt\u2019s been a lease that\u2019s been passed down,\u201d Ms. Goldman, 25, said. \u201cLuckily no one had to take down the walls.\u201dThose walls transform a $4,654-a-month, one-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bathroom apartment into a meticulously ordered three-bedroom. The original layout included a large living room with an adjacent open dining area that connects to an enclosed kitchen.The roommates\u2019 predecessors used temporary walls to split the living area into three spaces, with the back half of the living room becoming a windowed bedroom, the dining area becoming another by sealing off the doorway to the kitchen, and the front part of the living room serving as a windowless living area.Perhaps the most creative use of artificial walls is in the actual bedroom, where the full bathroom is tucked. To make it accessible to everyone, \u201cthey added a fake wall, so there\u2019s a hallway to the bathroom,\u201d Ms. Goldman said.Harley Landsberg, far left, Alexandra Weber, center, and Naomi Weinstein live in a two-bedroom-turned-three on the Upper East Side.Mr. Aronin, the lawyer, said that many landlords know it\u2019s not really legal to transform an apartment like this, but they don\u2019t care because their goal is simply to keep the unit rented. \u201cLandlords don\u2019t really care too much because one-bedrooms are sometimes $3,600, and what kind of 20-something can afford that?\u201dDan Wurtzel, the president of FirstService Residential New York, a property management firm, said his building managers are careful to follow the process and get buildings department approval for any new walls. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen plans get rejected,\u201d Mr. Wurtzel said. \u201cBut, what we need to be is vigilant and diligent in making sure no one sneaks something in and builds something without proper approval.\u201dIt\u2019s pretty common, however. And tenants often find ways to fill in the space above the wall by installing plexiglass or creating do-it-yourself insulated panels and wedging them in.Mr. Wurtzel, however, wants to ensure that if for some reason the Department of Buildings comes in for an inspection, the building management won\u2019t be liable. \u201cCompliance with regulatory laws and city ordinances is extremely important in our business,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t follow those procedures, you\u2019re creating a liability for the company, building owner, the board. It\u2019s a hot-button issue, and we spend a lot of time training and place a strong emphasis within my organization.\u201dOf course, the probability that a buildings inspector will just show up is extremely rare, according to Mr. Aronin. Building officials generally have more pressing issues to deal with, like enforcing construction codes for new high-rise buildings in Midtown, or regulating home additions in Queens, he said.The buildings department only actively investigates subdivided apartments if a complaint arrives through a 311 call, a department spokesman said. Thus most of the burden to enforce the rules falls on building owners and managers.When Harley Landsberg, 23, moved into her two-bedroom $4,400-a-month apartment on the Upper East Side with her two roommates, the management made it clear they could use only a single, preapproved company, and that only one type of wall could be installed. It cost them around $1,500.Although the wall creates a third bedroom, it leaves Ms. Landsberg\u2019s roommate, Alexandra Weber, with limited privacy, since she can hear everything going on in the living room and kitchen.\u201cShe goes to work a little bit later than me and my other roommate, which is kind of unfortunate since she can hear everything,\u201d said Ms. Landsberg, who works in public relations. \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing you can do about that.\u201dSam Meyer and Josh Sturm have a setup similar to Sara Goldman\u2019s. Their two-bedroom-turned-four-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side also has a living room that curves around the kitchen; their temporary walls split the living room and create two bedrooms, one where a dining room would be, next to the kitchen, another taking up part of the living room.Sam Meyer, left, and Josh Strum in the living room of their Upper West Side apartment.Mr. Meyer, 23, has the smallest room by far. \u201cIt kind of feels like you\u2019re living in Harry Potter\u2019s cupboard,\u201d said Mr. Meyer, who is in his freshman year at Columbia after serving for three years in the Israel Defense Forces.The roommates, three of whom grew up together in Toronto, don\u2019t mind the close quarters or the lack of privacy. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not for everyone,\u201d Mr. Meyer said. \u201cWhen you live with your best friends, it couldn\u2019t be better. We hardly spend time in our rooms.\u201dThey are better off than most in their situation. Their total rent is $4,600, which would be a steal for a real four-bedroom in Manhattan, and the building allowed their temporary walls to rise to the ceiling. Mr. Sturm, who works in finance, chose to include a transom in the wall to allow some light to flow into the living room. \u201cWe did it for the light,\u201d Mr. Sturm, 23, said. \u201cAnd most buildings won\u2019t even let you do it.\u201dThe building\u2019s management told them that as long as they used a pressurized wall they could build it to the ceiling. Pressurized walls require no adhesives or screws when put in place, but are installed snug between the existing walls and can be removed without damaging the permanent structure.\u201cThe codes, by definition, tell you that a wall is something that is fixed,\u201d he said. \u201cThese walls are fundamentally, totally different.\u201dDespite the restrictions, Mr. Zanger\u2019s business has continued to grow. He believes there\u2019s a disconnect between what developers build in New York City and what renters can afford. He said they are too focused on building luxury apartments geared toward the foreign buyer.\u201cIt\u2019s delusional,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when dividing an apartment, it can be $1,000 to $2,000 a month each. They need to start getting real, and understand they are creating a real estate bubble. They can\u2019t just go after the 2 percent anymore. They have to cater to a broader demographic.\u201dMr. Wurtzel says the notion isn\u2019t new or shocking. \u201cThere has been a housing crisis for the past 70 years,\u201d he said, and even with efforts to increase affordable housing, one group of individuals is being left out: the young professionals. They often make too much to qualify for affordable housing, but not enough to easily afford an apartment in a luxury building, he said, and developers \u201cdon\u2019t care.\u201dHe said he believes the main problem lies with brokers, who may mislead potential renters. \u201cYoung professionals go around with a broker and see an apartment. And the broker may make representations about adding a wall that aren\u2019t accurate, and the decisions are made by these individuals to rent or not rent, based on what the brokers are saying,\u201d he said.Mr. Wurtzel\u2019s suggestion? Move to Queens.\u201cMove to Astoria where you can live for a lot less money than you would in Murray Hill or Downtown Brooklyn,\u201d he said. \u201cOr, move to Long Island City where it\u2019s less expensive than living in Manhattan.\u201dThe cover article last Sunday about roommates who partition their apartments reversed the occupations of two of them.

{"Headline": "Free Market for Education? Economists Generally Don\u2019t Buy It", "Date": "2016-12-30", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewThe odds are good that privatizing education will be part of the agenda for President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s administration. The Republican platform calls for increasing the role of banks in giving out student loans. And Mr. Trump and the platform advocate an expansion of both vouchers, which enable students to attend the private school of their choice with government funds, and charter schools.While economists are trained about the value of free markets, they are also trained to spot when markets can\u2019t work alone and government intervention is required.A classic example is pollution. Factories and cars that spew toxins ruin the air for everyone. Pollution is what economists call a \u201cnegative externality\u201d: Drivers get the benefits of the gas they burn when they drive to work, but everyone else gets the bad emissions. Economists recommend governments use taxes and regulations to minimize this negative externality.Another way that government facilitates the functioning of markets is by helping consumers get clear information. People can make informed choices only if they know a product\u2019s qualities and price, whether it\u2019s a car, a mortgage or a college education. That is why automakers are legally required to disclose their cars\u2019 fuel efficiency, lenders have to use standard forms to describe the terms of a mortgage, and the federal Education Department\u2019s College Scorecard reports the graduation rates and earnings of colleges\u2019 alumni.In most markets, in fact, economists advocate striking a balance between free competition and regulation. While they vary considerably in where they would strike that balance, it\u2019s unusual for an economist to claim that private markets can serve every need without any government intervention at all.Excessive faith in the power of free markets can lead to infeasible policy proposals. The Republican platform recommends expanding the role of private banks in student loans, with the goal of enhancing financing choices for students. But making student loans a competitive, private-sector market is an unattainable goal. In economics textbooks, student loans are the example used to show there are some products that markets will never provide on their own.This is a capital-market failure: Private lenders won\u2019t provide liquidity for profitable investments. Because of this failure of private markets, across the world it is governments that provide student loans.There is a lot to fix in the current student loan system. Getting private banks back into the heart of the loan program is a solution to none of these problems, and will be costly to taxpayers. Until 2010, when a change in the law restricted their role in the loan program, banks had a sweet deal: They earned generous profits while the government assumed virtually all of the risk. Instead of bolstering banks\u2019 bottom lines, that money is now plowed back into education programs such as the Pell Grant for low-income students.Unswerving adherence to free, private markets will not solve the problems faced by our education system. In elementary and secondary education, market competition has produced impressive results when charter schools are given the freedom to innovate and held to a high standard of quality. In the case of loans for college students, the chimerical goal of creating a competitive market distracts from the real problems faced by colleges and their students.Advertisement"}

Then the resumed booms of incoming artillery shells from pro-government forces sent them into hiding or running for their lives.It was the latest life-or-death whiplash for the thousands trapped in the ruins of a once-vibrant northern metropolis, which has come to symbolize the atrocities unfolding in the nearly six-year-old war.That outcome would leave the whole city in the hands of forces loyal to the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad.Messages posted to a WhatsApp group by an English teacher in Aleppo describe what he saw in the shrinking rebel-held territory, as Syrian forces and their allies waged an assault to retake the city.The United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Ra\u2019ad al-Hussein, denounced the resumed shelling, calling it a probable war crime.\u201cThe way this deal was dangled in front of this battered and beleaguered population \u2014 causing them to hope they might indeed live to see another day \u2014 and then snatched away just half a day later is also outrageously cruel,\u201d Mr. al-Hussein said in a statement.\u201cThe Syrian government has a clear responsibility to ensure its people are safe, and is palpably failing to take this opportunity to do so,\u201d he said.As each side blamed the other for the deal\u2019s collapse, civilians inside the city issued anguished, angry pleas for international pressure to reinstate it. The Assad government and Iran, Syria\u2019s other main ally besides Russia, appeared not to have been fully consulted on the deal, according to international officials and others briefed on the talks, and were insisting on new conditions.Rebel groups outside the city resumed shelling government-held districts in Aleppo. Civilians in other rebel-held areas to the north protested against their leaders and ransacked posts of hard-line rebel groups, demanding they help those in Aleppo.Close to midnight Wednesday, rebel groups announced a new deal for another evacuation attempt on Thursday. Trapped civilians expressed disbelief, and the Syrian military denied that another deal had been reached.But by early Thursday the shelling had tapered off, residents reported, hoping the pause would hold.As the shelling escalated Wednesday morning, a radiology nurse in Aleppo, Mohamed al-Ahmad, said he hoped the world would hear \u201cour final scream,\u201d adding that the wounded, with rescue and medical services in disarray, were bleeding to death in the streets.Yasser, an accountant volunteering in a makeshift medical clinic, posted a photograph via WhatsApp of an injured girl lying on a hallway floor. She was 10, he said, with broken bones, and was crying and shouting: \u201cGet me out of Aleppo. I am afraid, I am cold. My back is hurting me. Where is the doctor?\u201dYasser, who asked to be identified only by his first name for fear of being arrested for contacting journalists, said in frustration, \u201cLet us leave \u2014 what is happening?\u201dProblems with the deal had been evident from the start. Soon after it was announced Tuesday night, Syrian officials said they had no knowledge of it, and there was no word from Iran.Then, around 1 a.m. Wednesday, a convoy of vans carrying dozens of wounded people, including fighters and their families, began making its way out of Aleppo.But the vans returned soon after, witnesses said, after Iranian-backed militiamen blocked the way and said they did not have Syrian government permission.The militiamen said they would not allow anyone out until rebel groups had ended their siege of Fouaa and Kfarya, two encircled Shiite enclaves in Idlib Province. Residents said they were told they could leave at 6 a.m., but as buses idled, the shelling resumed.Opposition leaders and civilians inside Aleppo said they believed that Iran had balked at a deal brokered by Russia. Osama Abu Zayd, a legal adviser to Syrian opposition factions, told The Associated Press that Iran\u2019s field commander in Syria was resisting it.The interests of Mr. Assad\u2019s two main backers, Russia and Iran, do not always dovetail. Iran has a stake in retaining the influence it gained by entering the conflict on behalf of Mr. Assad two years before Russia.Iran has trained, backed and financed the pro-government militias that have bolstered Syrian ground forces, with recruits from Iraq, Afghanistan and other countries, as well as Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militant group.Yasser, the accountant, said civilians in Aleppo did not approve of rebel shelling of civilians in Fouaa and Kfarya. \u201cWe are humans,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are not our enemies. They are civilians like us.\u201dThe Russian Defense Ministry blamed the rebels for the impasse, saying on Wednesday that they had \u201cresumed the hostilities\u201d at dawn, trying to break through Syrian government positions to the northwest. Residents questioned why rebels inside eastern Aleppo would start shooting again when they were about to escape.Later, negotiators said the Syrian government was asking for the release of prisoners and the bodies of dead soldiers, and for rebels to hand over fighters from the Qaeda-linked Levant Conquest Front.Our reporter\u2019s photographs and cellphone videos from a road trip in one of the world\u2019s most violent war zones.Government opponents also said they suspected Mr. Assad of stalling. His government has often skillfully played its backers against one another. The wrangling could provide cover to finish off Aleppo\u2019s last rebel enclave with force. As one Syrian military officer told Reuters in Aleppo recently, rebels must \u201csurrender or die.\u201dTroubles carrying out the accord were not surprising, as there was no international monitoring \u2014 United Nations officials said the Syrian government had refused their repeated pleas to observe \u2014 and no enforcement provision. The same problems have vexed other deals reached during the conflict.Malek, an activist who said he hoped to join his pregnant wife in northern Aleppo Province, and who asked to be identified only by his first name for fear of retaliation, said the world saw civilians in rebel-held territory as \u201cno longer human.\u201d\u201cThey think we are Daesh,\u201d he said via WhatsApp, using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State, the militant group that has established a so-called caliphate in parts of Syria but not in Aleppo.Using a mournful expression, he added, \u201cwe didn\u2019t taste the flavor of life.\u201dAt the United Nations on Tuesday, Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said there had been \u201ccredible reports\u201d of atrocities, including extrajudicial killings, as eastern Aleppo was retaken.Russia categorically denied the reports, and Mr. Ban said the world body had been unable to verify them.Dr. Salem Abou Al-Nasr, a dentist who had kept his clinic open until last week but finally moved to one of the last rebel neighborhoods when his was taken by government forces, said Wednesday morning that he could hear heavy shelling.\u201cWe slept a quiet night, but sadly the shelling is back,\u201d he said.\u201cThe situation can\u2019t wait,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone should know, we, the people here, we love life and want to live.\u201dThe evacuation plan came after two weeks of rapid advances by the Syrian Army and its allies, who drove insurgents into an ever-smaller pocket of eastern Aleppo, with support from heavy airstrikes and artillery fire.Rebel groups have received support from Turkey, the United States and Persian Gulf states, but far less than the direct military aid that Iran and Russia have provided to Mr. Assad.Reporting was contributed by Ivan Nechepurenko from Moscow, Somini Sengupta from the United Nations, and Karam Shoumali from Istanbul.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the War Ends in Syria", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorTOWNSHEND, Vt. \u2014 The civil war in Syria is over. Now it is time to stop the fighting.Aided by Russia, Iran, Shiite militias and Hezbollah, the government of President Bashar al-Assad is on the verge of taking Aleppo, once Syria\u2019s largest city. Supported by its powerful allies, the Syrian Army will then move to eliminate the remaining pockets of resistance, notably around the northern city of Idlib. While Iran has been Mr. Assad\u2019s most important military ally, the Syrian regime would still want to have Russian airpower to finish its reconquest of the country\u2019s populous west.The Assad regime has prevailed through tactics of unspeakable brutality \u2014 barrel bombs, starvation, the targeting of hospitals and rescue workers and the suspected use of chemical weapons \u2014 but it has prevailed. Samantha Power, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, has rightly focused attention on these war crimes, but these denunciations will make no difference to the situation on the ground.Though the outcome is clear, how the war ends matters greatly. The United States has an interest in a result that allows as many Syrians as possible to go home, that ensures the total defeat of the Islamic State and other extremist groups, and that safeguards the Syrian Kurds, who have been America\u2019s principal ally against the Islamic State.Achieving these goals will require close collaboration with Russia, whose intervention enabled Mr. Assad to turn the tide of the war. Fortunately, Russia shares many of America\u2019s objectives, even if its Syrian ally does not.The United States and Russia could start by negotiating terms that would end the fighting between the regime and the moderate opposition. The terms might include an amnesty for the rebels, the right of Syrian refugees to return and equal access to reconstruction assistance. It could even include some promises of basic political freedoms, international monitoring and the removal of Syrian officials (not including Mr. Assad) responsible for the worst crimes.The Russians have considerable leverage with a Syrian government that wants Russian backing for mopping-up operations. The United States, with less leverage, will have to persuade the non-Islamist opposition that a negotiated surrender is better than total destruction.European countries have a strong interest in creating conditions to encourage refugees in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey to return to Syria rather than heading west. America should work to ensure the diplomatic engagement of European allies to bring an end to hostilities, as well as their financial support for reconstruction in Syria.In eastern Syria, Kurdish forces supported by the United States Air Force and special forces are battling the Islamic State in a largely separate conflict. On a recent trip to the Kurdish areas, I traveled to within 15 miles of Raqqa, the capital of the Islamic State. Kurdish fighters feel confident that they can take the city, but their leaders understand that they\u2019re not in a position to govern a large Arab city. Since there is no viable Arab alternative to the Syrian government, this will mean transferring control of Raqqa to the regime in Damascus.Finally, the United States must provide long-term guarantees to the Syrian Kurds, who now control a large territory, not all of which is Kurdish. For now, the Syrian Army is in no position to take on the Kurdish forces, but eventually, Mr. Assad will surely try to recreate the centralized Arab state he inherited from his father. He will also want to use Syria\u2019s oil resources \u2014 much of which are now under Kurdish control \u2014 to finance reconstruction.One option is to establish an American-protected Kurdish safe area in northeastern Syria similar to the one created in northern Iraq after the first gulf war. That expensive option is complicated by the inability of the United States to use Turkish air bases to enforce it. (Turkey regards the Kurds as its leading enemy in Syria.) The less costly alternative is to co-sponsor a Russian plan for an autonomous Kurdish area within a federal Syria.However, Russia\u2019s leverage with Mr. Assad will diminish as the opposition crumbles in Syria\u2019s west and Russian airpower becomes less important. At that point, the opportunity to extract concessions will disappear, and the field will belong to Mr. Assad and Iran.President-elect Donald J. Trump has stated his intention to work with Russia and Mr. Assad to defeat the Islamic State. The sooner America reaches out to Russia, ideally before January\u2019s handover of administration, the better.Peter W. Galbraith is a former United States ambassador to Croatia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Giving Up \u2018Mostly Everything\u2019 to Care for His Wife", "Date": "2016-12-27", "News": "Supported byThe Neediest Cases Fund\u201cDon\u2019t scratch it.\u201dThose were the first words Abdou Travare\u2019s wife, Ramata, ever spoke to him. He was from Senegal and she was from Mali, but they met on a street in Paris. Both were attending college in France. Mr. Travare had stopped to examine her car, the same make and model as the one he drove, except hers was white and his was green.Just do not get too close to it, she warned him, a playful request that led to a short conversation, an exchange of names and a few laughs. The next day, Mr. Travare intentionally parked his car next to hers, and flirtatiously tried to use his key to open her car door.She was smitten. Five years later, in 1980, the couple married. \u201cWe\u2019ve been with each other for a while now,\u201d Mr. Travare, 60, said.Over the past 30 years, they have faced challenges together, including a lengthy time apart in the mid-1980s. During a vacation to San Francisco, Mr. Travare became so fond of the city that he decided to stay and pursue a master\u2019s degree in international finance at Golden Gate University. Three years went by before Mrs. Travare, who had stayed in Mali, was able to join her husband in the United States.Mr. Travare\u2019s job in financial management, one that required him to travel so often that he had to add pages to his passport, allowed him to return to Africa a few times each year to see his wife.He held different jobs in the decades that followed. Whenever career stress overwhelmed him, Mrs. Travare was always there with encouragement and support, he said.In 2009, they moved to New York City. Soon after, Mr. Travare noticed his wife was behaving oddly. \u201cAfter so many years, you know the person,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can just see something is not quite right.\u201dMrs. Travare would stare into space or turn on the stove only to leave it unattended. She became obsessed with cleaning and turning on every light in a room.\u201cIt was quite strange for me \u2014 very, very frightening,\u201d he said.Doctors determined that Mrs. Travare was experiencing the cognitive aftereffect of an unnoticed stroke she had had years before. She already had diabetes and heart disease, and now she was slipping into dementia.The condition worsened over time. Mrs. Travare, 59, now barely speaks, and when she does, her command of English has drastically changed. Many days, she is barely able to leave her bed, and she needs Mr. Travare\u2019s help to walk everywhere, including the bathroom.He stopped working in 2013 to care for her. \u201cI left everything, mostly everything, to be by her side,\u201d he said.But every so often, despite the grave diagnosis, Mr. Travare said, he sees glimpses of his wife\u2019s former self.\u201cI believe one day she will get better and be the same again,\u201d he said. \u201cI still believe it. That\u2019s what keeps me going.\u201dMr. Travare receives $733 in Social Security Insurance benefits each month. The couple also receive $215 in Social Security benefits and $350 in food stamps each month. He has spent much of his savings, and has struggled to pay their $1,335 monthly rent. By this past summer, they were more than $11,000 in arrears.Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, helped prevent the couple\u2019s eviction.

{"Headline": "Surge in Dollar Provokes Jitters in Emerging Markets Around World", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byThe election of Donald J. Trump has set off a monthlong run of investor ebullience, whose highlight has been a sustained increase in the value of the dollar against the world\u2019s currencies.It is a surge that has been embraced on Wall Street as a powerful emblem for a United States economy potentially poised to hit a higher gear thanks to tax cuts, government spending and regulatory relief \u2014 policy measures that the president-elect has promised to enact immediately.But around the globe, the surge in the dollar is provoking financial jitters.Emerging market countries and corporations that have been binging on cheap dollar debt for more than a decade now face a spike in servicing costs and elevated debt burdens.And the global financial giants \u2014 banks, insurance companies and mutual, pension and sovereign wealth funds \u2014 that have financed this $10 trillion borrowing bonanza must confront a period of higher interest rates and tighter financial conditions that will make them less willing to extend credit to companies and investors alike.\u201cIt is the ubiquitous nature of the dollar and its role in the global banking system,\u201d said Hyun Song Shin, the head of research at the Bank of International Settlements, a forum for global central banks. \u201cWhen the dollar goes up, it directly impairs the risk-taking capacities of banks and investors alike.\u201dA sharp move up in the currency should be seen as a blinking red warning light for investors, he wrote. When it moves in the other direction, then it is \u201crisk on,\u201d to use trader parlance for when it is time to lay down speculative bets.Since the election last month, a broad index for the dollar has risen 4 percent. This move, however, masks even sharper increases against a number of currencies.The dollar has gained 10 percent against the Mexican peso and 8 percent against the Japanese yen.Against the Chinese yuan, the move has been less pronounced \u2014 just 1.5 percent. But Mr. Trump\u2019s combative language toward China has ignited concerns in Beijing that local savers will try to send more of their deposits abroad, putting more downward pressure on the yuan.The rockiest reaction so far to the dollar\u2019s tear has been in Turkey.When the Turkish lira fell to its lowest level in decades against the dollar last week, the country\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, took the unusual step of urging Turks to sell the dollars that they had been hoarding and buy their local currency.With its high levels of debt in dollars and reliance on volatile capital flows for its financing needs, Turkey, more than most of its peers, has been vulnerable to the episodic fits of the emerging markets contagion that have plagued the global economy in recent decades.Boldly new, as well as contentious, Mr. Shin\u2019s thesis has not been wholly embraced by economists and policy makers.For example, William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the regulator that keeps the closest eye on incipient financial risks, has made it clear on numerous occasions that the dollar\u2019s recent rise should be seen as a positive sign.It is not just what a strong dollar says about a growing United States economy, but it is the further prospect that, as a result, Japan and Europe may also emerge from their years of deflationary slough.But as Mr. Shin and his team of economists at the Bank of International Settlements see it, it is not just the threat of the dollar\u2019s rise precipitating a crisis in a dollar-sensitive market like Turkey, South Africa or Brazil that is cause for worry.His concerns also center on the global banking system and the possibility that the dollar\u2019s rise will accentuate what he refers to as an emerging dearth of dollars, which could bring back memories of the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, when a global rush into dollars created a liquidity panic.Short-term borrowing rates skyrocketed, forcing hedge funds to shut down and banks to fail.\u201cThe lessons of the dollar is that everything is connected,\u201d he said. \u201cSpillovers and spill backs can loom large.Since the election, the cost of borrowing dollars short term in all these currencies has risen markedly, with Japan being the outlier.Connections between sustained periods of dollar strength and bouts of financial instability have been drawn by other analysts, like Julian Brigden at Macro 2 Intelligence Partners. In particular, he points to two such periods.The first is 1979 to 1985, when the dollar rose over 80 percent after Paul A. Volcker, then the chairman of the Federal Reserve, increased interest rates and President Ronald Reagan came to power pushing tax cuts.Then there were the years between 1995 to 2002, when currency crises rippled through Southeast Asia and the implosion of the dot-com boom in the United States rocked stock markets.That would be the flip side of quantitative easing, the policy of the past decade where central banks have flooded the world with cash in a bid to spur growth and combat deflation.\u201cThis is a concern for Fed Chair Yellen,\u201d said Paul Christopher, an investment strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors. \u201cIn the type of global economy we live in, she has to be careful about the dollar increasing too much, creating dollar shortages and liquidity problems as a result.\u201dAn article on Thursday about the surge in the dollar and its effects on emerging markets misstated a goal of quantitative easing. It is to combat deflation, not inflation.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Top of the Class", "Date": "2016-12-09", "News": "Supported byOpen BookPerhaps the least surprising appearance on the fiction list is by Colson Whitehead, whose \u201cThe Underground Railroad\u201d was the year\u2019s most talked-about novel. From its selection by Oprah for her book club to its taking home the National Book Award last month, Whitehead\u2019s reimagining of African-American history turned an already acclaimed writer into something closer to a household name.Though many well-established authors published notable fiction this year, the rest of the list is made up of writers who may not be familiar to you \u2014 yet. They include Han Kang, famous in her native South Korea but still working her way onto radars here, with the help of her harrowing and surreal novel \u201cThe Vegetarian,\u201d also a winner of the Man Booker International Prize earlier this year. Readers wanting to become more acquainted with Han\u2019s work won\u2019t have to wait long. She has published three novels in Korea since \u201cThe Vegetarian\u201d came out there, and one of them, \u201cHuman Acts,\u201d about a violent student uprising, will be published in the United States in January.Fitting for a year with a historic presidential election and frequent startling headlines about race, economics and terrorism, the nonfiction shelves overflowed with powerful and relevant work. Narrowing the list to five books, we still managed to cover a lot of ground: philosophy, campaign finance, poverty, gender, war and memory.

{"Headline": "Donald Trump Holds \u2018Thank You\u2019 Rally in Cincinnati, and Announces His Pick for Defense Secretary", "Date": "2016-12-01", "News": "Supported byTransition BriefingPresident-elect Donald J. Trump thanked supporters at a rally in Cincinnati on Thursday, and announced that he intends to nominate James N. Mattis as defense secretary. Watch the video below.After claiming credit for saving jobs in Indiana, Mr. Trump held a rally in Cincinnati to say thank you to Ohio, which he carried and where no recount is being demanded. Mr. Trump exulted in rallies during the campaign and seems to be itching to return to the adulation of the crowds. Other states are expected to be added to the tour in the days and weeks ahead.The decision by Gov. Jerry Brown of California to name Representative Xavier Becerra to be the state\u2019s attorney general has set off another round of finger-pointing among Democrats \u2014 and opened a crucial post in the Trump era.Mr. Becerra, like Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland before him and former Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois (now the mayor of Chicago) before them, had risen as far as he could in the House leadership. Mr. Becerra faced a blockade of older members of Congress, like Representatives Nancy Pelosi, Steny H. Hoyer, and James E. Clyburn, in the top ranks.Unlike Mr. Van Hollen, who was elected to the Senate last month, Mr. Becerra opted against running for his state\u2019s open Senate seat, but he has found his own way to statewide office.Mr. Becerra was in line for a huge consolation prize in the House, however. The veteran Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan had just stepped aside as the ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee \u2014 and he recommended the telegenic Californian for the post.That would have put Mr. Becerra on the front lines as Mr. Trump tries to repeal the Affordable Care Act, cut taxes, overhaul the tax code and possibly convert Medicare into a system that offers fixed sums to seniors to buy private health plans.Instead, it looks as if that role will go to Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, who may be less camera ready but is actually better versed on the intricacies of tax policy.So far Representative Keith Ellison\u2019s drive to be the next Democratic National Committee chairman has gone swimmingly, with no strong competition in sight.As a law student at the University of Minnesota, Mr. Ellison, writing under the name Keith E. Hakim in the student newspaper, said: \u201cWhether one supports or opposes the establishment of Israel in Palestine and Israel\u2019s present policies, Zionism, the ideological undergirding of Israel, is a debatable political philosophy. Anyone, including black people, has the right to hear and voice alternative views on the subject \u2014 notwithstanding our nominal citizenship.\u201dHe continued:\u201cAlternatively, the University\u2019s position appears to be this: Political Zionism is off limits no matter what dubious circumstances Israel was founded under; no matter what the Zionists do to the Palestinians; and no matter what wicked regimes Israel allies itself with \u2014 like South Africa. This position is untenable.\u201dMr. Ellison long ago renounced his associations with the Nation of Islam, and has had Jewish groups defend him. But the report could prove troublesome, to say the least.The Anti-Defamation League, which has been mildly supportive, reacted strongly.\u201cEllison\u2019s remarks are both deeply disturbing and disqualifying. His words imply that U.S. foreign policy is based on religiously or national origin-based special interests rather than simply on America\u2019s best interests. Additionally, whether intentional or not, his words raise the specter of age-old stereotypes about Jewish control of our government, a poisonous myth that may persist in parts of the world where intolerance thrives, but that has no place in open societies like the U.S. These comments sharply contrast with the Democratic National Committee platform position, which states: \u2018A strong and secure Israel is vital to the United States because we share overarching strategic interests and the common values of democracy, equality, tolerance and pluralism.\u2019 \u201dSenator Heidi Heitkamp, Democrat of North Dakota, is paying a visit to Trump Tower on Friday, and Senator Chuck E. Schumer of New York, the incoming minority leader, is having heart palpitations.\u201cI appreciate the president-elect inviting me for a meeting. ... Whatever job I do, I hope to work with the president-elect and all of my colleagues in Congress on both sides of the aisle to best support my state.\u201dTo Democrats, that last line can mean two things, neither of them good. If she is in line for an administration job, her Senate seat would turn Republican. If not, she seems to be indicating she is a possible vote for the Trump agenda.And no matter what, her seat is up in 2018 \u2014 in a state that went to Mr. Trump with 62 percent of the vote.The great chronicler of this year\u2019s presidential vote, Dave Wasserman of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, declared it official on Thursday: Jill Stein is the Ralph Nader of 2016. Her vote tallies in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania now exceed Mr. Trump\u2019s margins in the three Rust Belt states that gave him the presidency.Another point:In the end, the difference between a Trump presidency and another Clinton administration came down to 79,646 votes \u2014 fewer than a sellout for a Wisconsin Badgers football game.President-elect Trump took phone calls Wednesday from Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, and President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan. The results were instructive.\u201cPresident Trump said: \u2018Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, you have a very good reputation. You are a terrific guy. You are doing amazing work, which is visible in every way. I am looking forward to see you soon. As I am talking to you, prime minister, I feel I am talking to a person I have known for long. Your country is amazing, with tremendous opportunities. Pakistanis are one of the most intelligent people. I am ready and willing to play any role that you want me to play to address and find solutions to the outstanding problems. It will be an honor, and I will personally do it. Feel free to call me anytime, even before 20th January, that is before I assume my office.\u2019 \u201d\u201cOn being invited to visit Pakistan by the prime minister, Mr. Trump said that he would love to come to a fantastic country, fantastic place of fantastic people. \u2018Please convey to the Pakistani people that they are amazing, and all Pakistanis I have known are exceptional people,\u2019 said Mr. Donald Trump.\u201dWhile not exactly confirming the content, the Trump transition team did acknowledge both calls.The White House has been trying its best not to criticize Mr. Trump, but after those two phone calls, a top administration official suggested that Mr. Trump get some expert help.Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, noted that the relationship between Pakistan and the United States was \u201cquite complicated\u201d and got more so after the American raid into Pakistan that killed Osama bin Laden. And then Mr. Earnest mentioned where Mr. Trump could get some assistance.\u201cI\u2019m just making the observation that there are dedicated experts, public servants at the State Department that have years of experience that they have amassed that they\u2019re prepared to use to advise the incoming president,\u201d Mr. Earnest said.Ten Democratic senators have sent a strongly worded letter to Mr. Trump criticizing the number of \u201clobbyists and others with extensive ties to the fossil fuel industry\u201d in his transition team and among potential nominees for the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy and the Department of the Interior.Chalk up another tradition broken in the Trump era: the practice of cabinet picks going mum once they are named, shunning the news media until confirmed by the Senate.Steven Mnuchin, the newly named choice for Treasury secretary, made that break most evident on Wednesday, appearing on CNBC and before reporters at Trump Tower, musing at length on tax policy. Others including Wilbur L. Ross, tapped for commerce secretary, have been similarly voluble.This has surprised people in both parties familiar with the tortuous Senate confirmation process \u2014 and with what they see as the good reasons to stay silent.Talking to the press is \u201can opportunity to fail \u2014 it can only kind of cause you more headaches and questions,\u201d said Dean Zerbe, a former adviser to Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, on the Senate Finance Committee.Mr. Mnuchin, for example, said the Trump tax plan would give a big tax cut to the middle class but not to the wealthy, though a range of nonpartisan analyses have concluded the opposite.\u201cAs soon as I saw that,\u201d Mr. Zerbe said, \u201cmy immediate thought was, \u2018O.K., you\u2019ve just now given about a dozen questions to senators to ask about.\u2019\u201dThe Libertarian-leaning Representative Justin Amash, Republican of Michigan, weighed in early:Now it\u2019s coming from more intellectual circles.In exchange for allowing United Technologies to continue to offshore more than 1,000 jobs, Trump will reportedly give the company tax and regulatory favors that the corporation has sought. Just a short few months ago, Trump was pledging to force United Technologies to \u201cpay a damn tax.\u201d He was insisting on very steep tariffs for companies like Carrier that left the United States and wanted to sell their foreign-made products back in the United States. Instead of a damn tax, the company will be rewarded with a damn tax cut. Wow! How\u2019s that for standing up to corporate greed?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Great Wall\u2019 Producer on What Hollywood and China Can Teach Each Other", "Date": "2016-12-21", "News": "Supported bySinosphereAlong with those attributes come high expectations. Many are looking to see whether the film can help Hollywood further penetrate the fast-growing Chinese film market while fulfilling China\u2019s longstanding ambition to make a global cinematic hit. If it succeeds, industry analysts say this type of big-budget, cross-cultural movie could be a model for future co-productions between China and the United States, the world\u2019s top two film markets.How did you get involved in making this film?I got involved about four years ago when I joined Legendary. The movie was about to shoot, and we were looking at the budget and the story. The story seemed pretty clich\u00e9 and not exactly what we wanted to do, and we weren\u2019t able to hit a budget number that we wanted to hit. So we hit a pause button, and we started to rework the script. Then we showed it to Zhang Yimou. He was the first and the only person we showed it to.At one point did it become clear that \u201cThe Great Wall\u201d was going to be a kind of test for future big-budget Hollywood-China co-productions?We didn\u2019t set out to do that. It happened along the way. We thought, there\u2019s been a perfect storm of events that allow us to actually make this movie. The Chinese market is now big enough that we can return a big part of the box office on this movie and we can bring in major Chinese partners at significant investments. Before, Chinese investors would say, \u201cOh, we\u2019ll put in $5 million.\u201d This time our partners are in for 30 percent of this movie. So we thought, \u201cMaybe we can make a real Chinese story and maybe the world is ready for this in a way they weren\u2019t before. Plus Zhang Yimou is amazing, and great actors and talented people want to work with him. Let\u2019s just go for it.\u201dThe casting of the movie was entirely organic. This is the way the screenplay was written. It\u2019s not like that role was written as a Chinese person. It\u2019s a plot point that this guy has to show up and do these things. He drives the plot.It\u2019s interesting that so far, we haven\u2019t really seen any of the same discussions of race in this movie in the Chinese media. It seems to be a very specifically American issue.With this movie, Zhang Yimou and I set out to defy every stereotype that you can think of. All the roles you constantly see Chinese actors in are not in this movie. There is no mafia guy, there is no triad guy, there is no prostitute. There is none of that. And there\u2019s no stupid, phony, fake love story happening at the edge of the movie as the world is about to end.I think when people see the movie they\u2019ll think, \u201cWow, this is a big step in the right direction, and this is a true collaboration between actors in both countries and they at least have equal footing.\u201dWhat about the movie do you think will appeal to American moviegoers?It\u2019s a classic adventure story with a great group of heroes. Certainly there\u2019s never been a movie shot on the Great Wall before, especially one in which you\u2019re fending off monsters. Plus it\u2019s a huge action canvas that works to Zhang Yimou\u2019s strengths. Zhang Yimou was in Los Angeles for postproduction, and he played with the 3-D effects for eight months. So there are things you really haven\u2019t seen before, like smoke coming out of the screen. He took things that he would use in a classic Zhang Yimou art film and melded it into a really commercial format in a really interesting way.Based on this experience, what do you think American studios need to learn from Chinese studios and vice versa? In general the U.S. system of everybody being super independent and each department head having their own little fiefdom and only presenting finished work versus the Chinese system where everyone wants to ask the director every single little detail \u2014 I think there\u2019s probably a middle ground to be found somewhere there.What about on the more conceptual level? I think we need to probably start thinking less about China and how to make a good movie that has Chinese elements. When I worked at C.A.A. [Creative Artists Agency], I saw so many scripts, and everyone had a China idea and said, let\u2019s do a remake of this and a remake of that. At the time, \u201cThe Great Wall\u201d was the first project I saw that I thought, \u201cWow, this makes total sense. That\u2019s a good story. I understand that guy, I actually like that guy, and I understand why the people he meets up with are initially very unwelcoming to him and gradually warm to him as he changes and learns more about himself.\u201dHow does the movie stand out from past Hollywood-China co-productions?We feel like this is one of the first true co-productions. It wasn\u2019t coming to China just for finance or for access to the market. It was a story that organically took place here that organically had mixed actors, and it\u2019s something that U.S. studios and Chinese investors sparked to in the same way and invested in accordingly. It\u2019s basically what a co-production is supposed to be. The Chinese side is supposed to be 30 percent, but on a film of this scale, the Chinese side being 30 percent is unheard-of. So it must mean something. They must have really liked it. They must not think it\u2019s whitewashing or pandering or anything like that. So I guess, for me, being able to attract a filmmaker like Zhang Yimou and being able to attract a significant Chinese investment says something about the D.N.A. of this movie.An earlier version of this article misquoted Peter Loehr. He said, \u201cI think we need to probably start\u201d \u2014 not \u201cstop\u201d \u2014 \u201cthinking less about China and how to make a good movie that has Chinese elements.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Behind them was an abandoned factory of historical significance, but that was news to the children.One hundred and thirteen years ago this week, an airplane created by the Wright brothers made the first powered flight. Seven years later at that factory off West Third Street, the brothers built the first factory mass-producing airplanes for sale. Now, as part of a plan to renovate the factory, the children of West Dayton may be learning a lot more about the city\u2019s most famous sons and their world-altering invention.The original goal was simple: Save the two gable-roofed brick buildings from demolition by having them added to the National Park Service\u2019s five-stop aviation trail in the area. This has turned into a multimillion-dollar, 54-acre development project, and one that by necessity has come to echo the Wright brothers\u2019 inventiveness and determination.Dayton, a manufacturing city once known as the city of a thousand factories, started losing jobs in the industry about a decade ago, said Ford Weber, the city\u2019s director of economic development. The downturn and housing crisis of 2008 took a major toll on the city, with an increase in mortgage foreclosures. The damage of that time remains apparent today in the West Dayton neighborhood. Nearly every block around the factory has shuttered or has collapsing homes and buildings.The group wanted to preserve the site after the last owner of the buildings, an auto parts manufacturer, moved out and declared bankruptcy. Tony Sculimbrene, executive director of the alliance, said he feared the factory might be bulldozed. When the designation was given, though, it did not include money for the rehabilitation, and the alliance had to find ways to finance it.\u201cI specifically remember saying to myself: \u2018How are we going to do this? How are we going to save it without the Park Service?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Sculimbrene said. \u201cThat\u2019s when we switched from it being purely a historic project to it being an economic development project.\u201dHome Avenue Redevelopment, a brownfield developer that had acquired the property out of bankruptcy, razed all but the Wright brothers\u2019 factory complex. It removed hazardous materials and made the land shovel-ready with $3.5 million from the city and state, and $2 million that was part of the sales agreement between the owner \u2014 DPH Holdings, which does business as the auto parts manufacturer Delphi \u2014 and the buyer.Early next year, the property will change hands again when the alliance buys it from Home Avenue Redevelopment. Then the Park Service will occupy the factory buildings, giving it what Dean Alexander, superintendent of the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park, calls \u201c40,000 square feet of blank canvas.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a challenge to take an old factory and turn it into something that\u2019s exciting for the general public to come visit,\u201d Mr. Alexander said. \u201cThe Park Service is always looking for new ways to engage younger generations and more diverse populations.\u201dWhat will fill the remaining three factory buildings adjacent to the historic Wright Brothers plant is still being discussed. Classrooms focusing on science, technology, engineering and math education, or STEM, are one option.\u201cOur country has become such a STEM country and the Wright brothers were all of that,\u201d said Amanda Wright Lane, a great-grand-niece of the brothers who lives in Columbus and supports the alliance\u2019s plan. \u201cKids could come in and see what that meant 100 years ago.\u201dThe nearest neighbor to the park has already been determined; the Dayton Public Library is building a $7 million branch across the street.\u201cHaving a public library with a national park, it doesn\u2019t get better than that,\u201d said Timothy R. Gaffney, spokesman for the alliance. \u201cThe library will draw people from around the neighborhood to the site. The factory will draw people from around the world.\u201dFinding businesses for the 34 acres of industrial property just outside the Park Service remains a challenge.Mr. Gaffney noted that some companies in light manufacturing and advanced aviation material production see the Wright brothers\u2019 legacy as relevant to their business. \u201cI\u2019ve been in touch with some business, they want to associate their brand with the birthplace of the aviation industry,\u201d he said.The rosiest projections forecast as many as 500 new jobs with an average annual salary of $40,000 coming to the area, said Shelley Dickstein, the Dayton city manager. \u201cWhether the market delivers what we\u2019d like to see, there is the real question,\u201d she added.Jean Brown, of the nearby Westwood neighborhood, said she hoped that rejuvenating the factory would benefit its residential neighbors. She noted that after the Wright-Dunbar Interpretive Center, about two miles from the factories, was complete and became a stop on the aviation trail, housing in that area improved. \u201cThey got so many new buildings up there,\u201d Ms. Brown said. \u201cThey say they\u2019re coming this way.\u201dThe impact of aviation is not confined to the last century, or even to people who fly frequently, Ms. Wagstaff said.\u201cEvery weekend I fly, and I see how it can change lives,\u201d Ms. Wagstaff said, \u201cbut if you don\u2019t fly, how do you know how special it is? That\u2019s what restoring the factory for the public accomplishes.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified the Wright brother shown in a cutout.

{"Headline": "How Big Banks Are Putting Rain Forests in Peril", "Date": "2016-12-03", "News": "Global lenders, sometimes flouting their own policies, have financed projects in Indonesia and elsewhere that destroy ecosystems and contribute to climate change.Supported byIn early 2015, scientists monitoring satellite images at Global Forest Watch raised the alarm about the destruction of rain forests in Indonesia.Environmental groups raced to the scene in West Kalimantan province, on the island of Borneo, to find a charred wasteland: smoldering fires, orangutans driven from their nests, and signs of an extensive release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\u201cThere was pretty much no forest left,\u201d said Karmele Llano S\u00e1nchez, director of the nonprofit International Animal Rescue\u2019s orangutan rescue group, which set out to save the endangered primates. \u201cAll the forest had burned.\u201dThe year before the clearing of trees in West Kalimantan, Rajawali\u2019s plantation arm secured $235 million in loans \u2014 funds that the Indonesian company used to buy out a partner and bolster its landholdings \u2014 from banks including Credit Suisse and Bank of America, according to an examination of lending data by The New York Times.That figure is almost certainly incomplete because not all financing is made public. It also excludes loans made by the same banks to forestry projects outside Southeast Asia, or financing provided to other, more global players. And it contrasts with efforts by companies like Nestl\u00e9 and Procter & Gamble to distance themselves from suppliers linked to deforestation.\u201cDestroying the world\u2019s forests makes fighting climate change almost impossible,\u201d said Andrew W. Mitchell, executive director of the Global Canopy Programme, a forestry think tank. \u201cThe finance sector is really lagging behind in realizing that.\u201dThe 2014 deal financed Rajawali\u2019s expansion into palm oil by helping the conglomerate buy out a former partner, invest in new palm oil mills and increase its landholdings. Demand for palm oil is surging worldwide, driven by rising incomes in markets like China and India and a switch away from trans fats by Americans and Europeans.Rajawali\u2019s plantations have been accused by environmental and labor groups of deforestation and illegal burning. Indonesia is one of the world\u2019s biggest palm oil producers, and forestry loss there and elsewhere ranks as one of the biggest single contributors to global warming.Sebastian Sharp, a spokesman for Rajawali\u2019s plantation arm, acknowledged that the burning and clearing on its West Kalimantan forest sites might be illegal but said local communities encroaching on its properties and starting the fires were to blame. He said the company did not engage in illegal burning or clearing.Credit Suisse declined to comment on its Rajawali deal or to say whether the deal violated its sustainability policies. A Bank of America spokesman, Bill Halldin, said that the most serious accusations against Rajawali came after the 2014 loan, in which the bank played \u201ca very small role.\u201d\u201cToday, we would certainly consider more information before making any decision on any client,\u201d he said.Brigitte Seegers, a spokeswoman for ABN Amro, declined to comment.Climate concerns have been brought into sharp relief by the impending presidency of Donald J. Trump, who has called climate change a hoax. Mr. Trump has said he will pull the United States out of the Paris accord, a commitment by 195 countries to take concrete measures to reduce planet-warming carbon emissions.Rajawali originally operated its palm plantation business, Green Eagle Holdings, as a joint venture with the French conglomerate Louis Dreyfus. But starting in 2014, Rajawali took the first step to consolidate the palm oil business under its control, and invest in new infrastructure.Its loans from Western banks were crucial. In January 2014, Green Eagle attracted a $120 million loan from a group of lenders led by ABN Amro. In July of that year, it scored an even bigger loan of $235 million from a syndicate led by Credit Suisse. Bank of America also took part in that loan.The banks issued those loans as Rajawali was being accused of extensive forest and peatland destruction, illegal burning, use of child labor and the use of force against workers at plantations under its control.Land-cover mapping by the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry, and satellite imagery from Global Forest Watch, show forest loss at two sites in West Kalimantan from 2011 to 2013 and again in 2015, with much of the forest gone by the end of the year. Those sites included around 11,000 hectares of peat, which, when set alight, can smolder for months underground.Zamzami, who goes by one name, a Greenpeace staff member in Indonesia who visited a Rajawali plantation in West Kalimantan in September 2015, said the burning continued. \u201cIt was difficult to breathe because of the smoke,\u201d he said in field notes. \u201cFar away, on the horizon, I could see the forest wall.\u201dEagle High is now one of Indonesia\u2019s largest palm oil plantation operators, with more than a million acres in land rights under its control, according to an investors\u2019 presentation dated September 2014.In December 2015, a 22-year-old worker was shot dead at the plantation by state security forces. It was unclear why state forces were on private property.Mr. Sharp, the Eagle High spokesman, blamed local villagers for the forest clearing and burning on its sites. \u201cIt\u2019s being done by local communities, and we have no control over that,\u201d he said. Environmental groups argue that plantation companies are responsible for protecting their sites.Mr. Sharp said that there were instances in which workers brought their children to plantations but that the company was \u201ctrying to brainstorm ways in which we can stop them from doing that.\u201dHe also questioned the wisdom of Indonesian labor law. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we hire children at 15? Families need income,\u201d he said. Under the country\u2019s law, the minimum age for hazardous work, including jobs on plantations, is 18.The worker who was killed, Marvel Doga, was \u201cdrunk and violent, poured petrol everywhere and threatened to set fire, and he had with him a bow and arrow\u201d when nearby state security forces tried to incapacitate him, leading to his death, Mr. Sharp said. He said Eagle High paid \u201cthousands of dollars\u201d to his family in compensation.Credit Suisse and ABN Amro declined to discuss specific deals. Bank of America declined to comment on the accusations.But in a February 2015 research note, Credit Suisse deemed Rajawali\u2019s palm oil push a success. Eagle High\u2019s increased landholdings and land rights signaled \u201csignificant headroom for expansion\u201d of palm oil production, Priscilla Tjitra, an equity analyst for the bank, said in a report to clients.\u201cThe allocation of finance is so influential in our economy and to our environment,\u201d said Tom Picken of the Rainforest Action Network. \u201cBut there\u2019s little way we can hold financial sectors to account.\u201dInternational Animal Rescue, which runs a temporary shelter for about 100 orangutans in West Kalimantan, said its staff had rescued roughly 50 of the primates during the 2015 burning season, twice the number the organization rescues in an average year.\u201cThey were all starving, all skinny,\u201d said Ms. S\u00e1nchez, the orangutan rescue group\u2019s director. So far this year, about 25 orangutans have been rehabilitated.\u201cThe problem is that every time an area is destroyed and orangutans are under real threat, we have to look for areas to release them, and that\u2019s challenging,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re running out of places where we can release these orangutans.\u201dIn September, Rajawali\u2019s plantation arm secured a $192 million loan from Bank Negara Indonesia, a state bank, to refinance the debt held by its plantation subsidiaries and to double the capacity of palm oil refineries in Papua and West Kalimantan.Bank Negara Indonesia\u2019s sustainability policies say that its clients must adopt \u201cminimum environmental, social and governance standards.\u201d The bank did not respond to requests for comment.An article last Sunday about some financing by global lenders for projects that contribute to climate change misstated the number of countries involved in the Paris accord on planet-warming carbon emissions. It is 195, not 95.Advertisement"}

Artifacts from the Palace Museum collection highlighting imperial life and culture in China will be exhibited on a long-term basis.Government officials are describing the project as part of larger celebrations planned for next year to mark the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong\u2019s transfer in 1997 from British colonial rule to China.For many in Hong Kong, the announcement on Friday came as a surprise, prompting critics to raise concerns about the lack of transparency in the government\u2019s decision-making process.On Monday, Ms. Lam dismissed the concerns, asserting that the preparation and approval of the new museum had been carried out \u201cin accordance with procedures.\u201dWith the new Hong Kong Palace Museum, however, there will be no denying Beijing\u2019s presence. The original Palace Museum, which was founded in 1925 in the heart of China\u2019s capital, is, along with the Great Wall, one of China\u2019s most prominent landmarks.In 2014, more than 15 million people visited the Palace Museum, which is housed within the Forbidden City, though it probably is remembered more for its vermilion walls, white marble footbridges and yellow-glazed roof tiles than for its collection of artifacts, which are typically displayed in the wings of the sprawling complex.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Financial Technology Start-Ups to Get a License to Bank", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byRegulators are planning to create a new type of banking license that will allow upstart financial technology companies to expand more quickly across the country.The licenses from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which oversees many national banks, will be available to companies like Square and Lending Club that accept deposits, facilitate electronic payments or lend money.Many technology firms have been pushing for some sort of new regulatory system that would allow them to cut through the patchwork of state and federal laws that govern financial activities and make it hard to expand nationally.The introduction of the licenses, called special purpose national bank charters, underscores how quickly so-called fintech firms are growing and how significant they are considered to the future of the financial industry.\u201cProviding a national charter to those responsible innovators who seek one and meet our high standards can help promote economic growth across the country and recognizes that technology-based products and services are the future of banking and the economy,\u201d Mr. Curry said in a speech at Georgetown University.But consumer advocates and state banking regulators have already been expressing concern that a new national charter could allow start-ups to get around state laws intended to protect consumers in areas like payday lending.Mr. Valenti said that any weakening of state laws could be a particular problem at a time when the incoming president, Donald J. Trump, has promised to broadly cut back federal financial regulations.Mr. Curry acknowledged some of these concerns in his speech on Friday, but he argued that competition in the financial industry was driving down the prices of financial products and opening access to the financial system for lower-income people who used to be shut out.\u201cWhat excites me most about the changes occurring in financial services is the great potential to expand financial inclusion, reach unbanked and underserved populations, make products and services safer and more efficient, and accelerate their delivery,\u201d Mr. Curry said.Companies applying for the new charter would need to demonstrate their commitment to \u201cfinancial inclusion,\u201d the agency said on Friday.The financial industry has been shaken up in recent years by tech start-ups that have taken on business services that were traditionally restricted to banks, like lending and electronic payments.Mr. Curry noted that the amount of investment going into these so-called fintech companies had risen to $24 billion from $1.8 billion five years ago.Companies like Lending Club, an online loan marketplace, and Square, which allows small businesses to accept electronic payments, have been changing the ways Americans expect to receive financial services. These companies have also operated outside of some of the regulatory constraints on traditional banks.Regulators around the world have scrambled to keep up with the new developments and ensure that customers of the new companies are receiving the same protections they have had in the traditional financial system. Entrepreneurs have complained that existing regulations are stifling new innovation.Some countries, like Britain and Singapore, have tried to create a friendlier regulatory environment to encourage the new players and attract new companies.Of the many financial regulators in the United States, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has been the most active in trying to keep up with the changes in the industry. Earlier this year, the agency created an Office of Innovation to serve as a central point of contact for new companies that are trying to figure out their regulatory responsibilities.Banks and state bank supervisors have strongly objected to the agency\u2019s moves on this front, seeing them as a way to allow in new competitors without forcing them to follow all the existing rules.For their part, many fintech start-ups have complained that under existing rules they have to partner with traditional banks, which often do not want to work with them, to provide basic financial services.\u201cIt\u2019s great to have this new charter as an option,\u201d said John Beccia, the general counsel at Circle, a start-up based in Boston that allows customers to send instant payments as well as to buy and hold virtual currencies. \u201cThere are a lot of benefits to this.\u201dUnder the current rules, Circle has to hold all of its customers\u2019 deposits in a partner bank and has to use the bank\u2019s systems any time it wants to move money to another customer or issue a credit card. With a license, Circle and other companies might be able to offer many of these services on their own.Mr. Curry said on Friday that fintech companies could continue to work under the existing rules, partnering with banks, but would have the option of applying for the new charter.It is unclear if companies chartered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency would be able to get the deposit insurance offered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.Banks and consumer advocates have expressed the most concern over the possibility that a national charter for fintech companies could allow new online lenders to evade state caps on interest rates and other local rules designed to cut down on predatory lending.Mr. Curry\u2019s agency will not begin offering the charters until after a public comment period that ends in January.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Guilty Verdict for I.M.F. Chief Christine Lagarde: A Primer", "Date": "2016-12-19", "News": "Supported byShe will not serve jail time or have to pay a fine. Butut her position at the Washington-based I.M.F. is on shaky ground, at a time when the organization faces questions over its participation in a multibillion-dollar bailout for Greece and uncertainty about the role of the United States in the organization. The fund\u2019s executive board will meet later on Monday to consider its options.Here is a quick primer on the case.Ms. Lagarde was accused of \u201cnegligence by a person in a position of public authority,\u201d related to a 2007 arbitration case involving Bernard Tapie, a French tycoon close to Nicolas Sarkozy, then France\u2019s president. In the case, Mr. Tapie was awarded more than 400 million euros, or $430 million, to settle a dispute with the partly state-owned bank Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais.The size of the award stunned and angered the French public, and some of Ms. Lagarde\u2019s advisers suggested that she take action to appeal the arbitration decision. But she declined to do because, her lawyer said, it would have resulted in costly new lawsuits by Mr. Tapie.She maintained her innocence throughout the trial, calling the charges politically motivated.The case was heard by the Cour de Justice de la R\u00e9publique, a special court founded in 1993 to consider criminal cases against government officials. It is made up of 12 French Parliament members and three Supreme Court justices.Ms. Lagarde can appeal the case on procedural grounds to France\u2019s highest criminal court, the Cour de Cassation. But her lawyer has suggested she may not because there was not any punishment. The court, which noted her national and international stature, spared her a criminal record.Her position in the I.M.F. is under scrutiny. At the fund\u2019s executive board meeting on Monday, the board could ask for her resignation immediately, or Ms. Lagarde could offer it voluntarily.But both of these steps are considered remote, given that the board just backed her for a second term in February.The I.M.F.\u2019s directors have been well aware of Ms. Lagarde\u2019s legal difficulties in France, which have dogged her for around a decade. With the specter of an acquittal rising, it was expected that Ms. Lagarde would quickly move past the issues.The surprise verdict could increase pressure on the fund to widen its leadership search. The I.M.F.\u2019s practice of awarding the top job to a senior European official has come under increased criticism in recent years, especially as the influence of emerging economies has grown.Of the last six leaders of the fund, four have come from France. The last two \u2014 Ms. Lagarde and her predecessor, Dominique Strauss-Kahn \u2014 have encountered serious legal problems.Advertisement"}

It connects professionals like plumbers and electricians with consumers and retail stores. The company bears similarities to the Indian start-up Housejoy, which Qualcomm Ventures also backs.An early investor, RCV Capital, a vehicle that the private equity firm Riverwood Capital maintains for its partners, also joined in the round.For Temasek, which put in $8 million, or half of the round, such a small investment is atypical. Nor has Latin America been a priority. Only 2 percent of its roughly $168 billion portfolio is invested in the region.It recently invested in QuintoAndar, a Brazilian internet company trying to ease the apartment renting process here. Acacia Partners in New York also backed that company in the round.Qualcomm Ventures has provided financing for 16 companies in Latin America, almost all based in Brazil. The firm\u2019s global portfolio has more than 140 companies.\u201cDespite the mess in Brazil, the tech start-up industry continues to progress,\u201d Mr. Kokron said.IguanaFix and Qualcomm Ventures first connected more than two years ago but were on different paths. IguanaFix was focused on Argentina, and Qualcomm Ventures, whose Latin America office is based in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, sought start-ups based in that country.This year, however, Qualcomm Ventures \u201cdecided it is time to be proactive and go beyond Brazil,\u201d Mr. Kokron said.IguanaFix says it is ready to grow in the region.Seventy percent of its revenue comes from Argentina, but Mr. Recchia expects that figure to drop to about 30 percent by the end of 2017.Mr. Recchia grew up in Venezuela and worked there at Procter & Gamble. He was at the consulting firm McKinsey & Company in the United States before joining joined Vostu, a social gaming start-up in Buenos Aires, in 2010.Vostu was founded by Daniel Kafie, Mario Schlosser and Joshua Kushner, brother of Jared Kushner, who is the son-in-law of President-elect Donald J.

One day, he said, he laid off 400 employees at Vostu, 80 percent of the company\u2019s work force, in what he described as \u201cone of the worst days of my life.\u201dThat experience taught him lessons for his current company.In forming IguanaFix, he said that he and his co-founder, Andres Bernasconi, who also worked at Vostu, chose to stay away from content businesses and sought to build something sustainable before raising much capital.\u201cWe wanted something with real barriers of entry,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

As a teenager, he contracted polio, which affected the left side of his body and caused one leg to be shorter than the other, a deformity that was corrected by surgery.He attended Marquette University and served briefly in the Army.Mr. Hulseman started working in a Solo factory at age 18 and held various jobs, including purchasing. He later worked on developing the company\u2019s plastics business, and he became company president in 1980. Later, he became its chief executive and chairman.\u201cHe knew plastics manufacturing like nobody,\u201d said Paul Hulseman, who worked at the company with some of his siblings. \u201cHe built plants and machines and tooling.\u201dRobert Hulseman resigned as chairman in 2006, two years after Solo acquired the holding company of Sweetheart Cup, another maker of disposable food packaging. The family had lost control of Solo to the private equity firm that helped finance the Sweetheart deal. At the time, Solo had sales of $2.5 billion and a net loss of $373 million. In 2012, Dart Container acquired Solo.Besides his son Paul, Mr. Hulseman is survived by two daughters, Margaret Kovach and Patricia Hulseman; six other sons, Richard, Robert, Joseph, Thomas, Lawrence and William; 29 grandchildren; and a brother, John.

{"Headline": "John Kerry, in a Final, Pointed Plea, Will Outline a Vision of Mideast Peace", "Date": "2016-12-27", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In a last-chance effort to shape the outlines of a Middle East peace deal, Secretary of State John Kerry plans to describe in a speech on Wednesday the Obama administration\u2019s vision of a final Israeli-Palestinian accord based on bitter lessons learned from an effort that collapsed in 2014.The speech, the latest salvo in a final conflict between Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Obama as Donald J. Trump prepares to assume the presidency, will make the case that \u201cthe vote was not unprecedented\u201d and that Mr. Obama\u2019s decision \u201cdid not blindside Israel.\u201d Mr. Kerry, the official said, would cite other cases in which Washington officials had allowed similar votes under previous presidents.The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a coming speech, said Mr. Kerry would also argue that, with the notable exception of Israel, there was a \u201ccomplete international consensus\u201d against further settlements in areas that might ultimately be the subject of negotiations.At this late date, weeks ahead of the inauguration of Mr. Trump, who openly lobbied on Israel\u2019s side against the United Nations resolution, it is unclear what Mr. Kerry hopes to achieve from the speech, other than to leave a set of principles that he believes will one day emerge as the basis for talks, if and when they resume.Mr. Kerry, the official said, has long wanted to give a speech outlining an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal but was held back by White House officials, who saw it as unnecessary pressure on Israel that would anger Mr. Netanyahu. But that objection was lifted last week as Mr. Obama and Mr. Kerry agreed the time had come to abstain on the United Nations resolution. That decision led to one of the biggest breaches yet in the rocky American-Israeli relationship during the Obama years.Mr. Kerry had planned to give the speech last Thursday, ahead of the Security Council vote, but he scrapped that plan the next morning when Egypt, under pressure from Mr. Netanyahu, postponed voting on the resolution. The resolution was taken up by four other nations, led by New Zealand, whose officials say the decision was not based on pressure from the Obama administration or any other nation.But Mr. Kerry\u2019s effort has been dead for more than two years. The decision to go ahead with his speech in the waning days of the administration is characteristic of Mr. Kerry, a serial negotiator who over the past four years traveled the world on three major missions: an Israeli-Palestinian accord, the Iranian nuclear accord, and a cease-fire and political accord for Syria. He will leave office on Jan. 20 having achieved the nuclear deal, but having tried and failed on the other two.Still, Mr. Kerry\u2019s speech is important because the administration\u2019s decision to let the resolution pass has created more political repercussions \u2014 including from Democrats \u2014 than the White House anticipated. The incoming Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, condemned the decision. George Mitchell, a former Maine senator and Middle East negotiator, said on Tuesday on MSNBC that Mr. Obama should have vetoed the resolution because \u201cthis moves Israel further away\u201d from an eventual accord. He said he feared it would have the same effect on the Palestinians.Former members of the Obama administration say that Mr. Netanyahu has long opposed having Mr. Kerry lay out the terms of an eventual settlement, for fear it could become the basis of another Security Council resolution, giving him even less negotiating room. But it is unclear that any such resolution could be organized in the next three weeks. The senior State Department official said the United States anticipated no further United Nations action based on Mr. Kerry\u2019s outline.Mr. Kerry\u2019s desire, his aides said, is to focus the discussion on several of the long-running disputes that have upended decades of negotiation attempts: where to draw borders, how to establish security, the status of Jerusalem, how to handle mutual recognition of Israeli and Palestinian states. Each is filled with land mines, and Mr. Kerry\u2019s speech will no doubt contain many of the code words that mean so much to both sides, and that have hardened so many positions over the years.But he is giving the speech at a time when Mr. Netanyahu has focused on the politics of the moment. The Israeli prime minister took the remarkable step of engaging Mr. Trump as an envoy to President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, to persuade him to postpone the resolution. After a call with the man with whom he will soon be negotiating American aid, Mr. Sisi relented.In the end, Venezuela, Senegal, New Zealand and Malaysia took up the resolution that Egypt had postponed. The Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, Riyad Mansour, said Thursday he had no idea how the Americans would vote.On Friday, Council diplomats skipped lunch. They discussed South Sudan. They discussed Syria. Then, after closed-door consultations, they voted on the resolution to condemn Israeli settlement-building.\u201cWe did not discuss the substance of the resolution at any time with the United States,\u201d Gerard van Bohemen, New Zealand\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, said later, disputing Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s account that the vote was orchestrated in Washington. \u201cWe did not know how the United States would vote.\u201dThe surprise was palpable. Rom\u00e1n Oyarzun Marchesi of Spain, which holds the rotating presidency of the Council, asked for a show of hands in support of the resolution: 14 hands went up. He asked for a show of hands against: zero hands went up. A gasp was heard in the Council chamber. It meant that the United States, which can unilaterally veto a resolution as a permanent member of the Security Council, had not done so. When Mr. Oyarzun asked for a show of hands in abstention, only Ms. Power put up hers.The Council chamber broke out in applause.Somini Sengupta contributed reporting from Mumbai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Second Ave. Subway, Cuomo Has Hands-On Role and Eye on the Future", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byAs governor of New York, Andrew M. Cuomo has no shortage of complex problems demanding his attention. But his ire has recently been focused on a small switch in a subway station deep below the streets of Manhattan.Delays with the switch, known as a shunt trip breaker, were holding up progress on the Second Avenue subway \u2014 a \u201cdemonic device that has frustrated us for months,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said as he inspected a new station at 96th Street on the Upper East Side on Monday.\u201cThere\u2019s 800 little things like shunt trip breakers that you have to get past,\u201d the governor said. \u201cEach station has its own little problems.\u201dA 24-block trek with Mr. Cuomo this week through the new subway tunnels and stations offered a rare glimpse inside the long-delayed $4.4 billion project that for many New Yorkers had come to symbolize a dream that might never be realized. The shiny modern stations are filled with dozens of workers and a steady whir of buzz saws, but the line appears remarkably close to being done.\u201cThis fire safety test could go bad, and then you\u2019re nowhere,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said after climbing a ladder onto the platform at the 86th Street station, clad in work boots and khaki pants, though notably missing the hard hat worn by others.A day after visiting the new stations, Mr. Cuomo was aboveground on Tuesday, standing in front of the Tappan Zee Bridge in Tarrytown to trumpet progress toward a 2018 opening. During the subway tour on Monday \u2014 at least his third trip to the line in four days \u2014 Mr. Cuomo marveled at the work it took to dig the tunnels as he walked along the train tracks to the 72nd Street station.\u201cWhen was the last time we built something that we said, \u2018Wow\u2019?\u201d he said. \u201cThis is wow.\u201dHis push to meet the deadline is an effort to improve the reputation of the often-maligned transportation authority, which runs the region\u2019s subways, buses and commuter railroads and is known for delays on major construction projects. Beyond the required testing, workers are still racing to finish station entrances and other final work.\u201cIf we\u2019re not done January 1,\u201d the governor said, \u201cI will stand up and say we failed to make the deadline, and I\u2019m disappointed.\u201dFor months, Mr. Cuomo has held weekly meetings at his office with the project\u2019s leadership team to address \u2014 and sometimes vent about \u2014 the latest issues and concerns. He became more involved about a year and a half ago, he said, when officials at the authority told him they wanted to push back the long-established December 2016 deadline by a year or two.\u201cThe meetings are not a love fest,\u201d said Charlie Hall, a construction manager from the engineering firm Parsons Brinckerhoff who is overseeing the project. \u201cThe meetings started because there were issues, and things weren\u2019t getting done. People are challenged in those meetings.\u201dOn an unannounced stop at the 86th Street station a few months ago, Mr. Cuomo was angered to see no one was working on a problematic escalator, Melissa DeRosa, his chief of staff, said. He walked around shouting, \u201cWho is working on the escalator?\u201d until the person appeared, she added.The governor\u2019s strong sway raised the question, Mr. Vitiello said, \u201cAre we a perfunctory board, or are we really a board of independent fiduciaries?\u201d\u201cYou have to get it done,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you have to get it done in a way that brings the community along.\u201dOfficials hope to finish testing at the Second Avenue stations by Dec. 22, giving workers a weeklong \u201ccushion\u201d in case there is a problem, Mr. Cuomo said. They are unlikely to set a firm opening date for the line, which will run as an extension of the Q train, before the tests are completed. Mr. Cuomo said he did not favor an idea transit officials had discussed to possibly skip any stations that were not ready, in order to say the line opened on time.\u201cWhen the governor puts his mind to something, it happens,\u201d said Nick Sifuentes, the deputy director of the Riders Alliance, an advocacy group. \u201cThat\u2019s what we need for the whole system.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wall Street Is Europe\u2019s Landlord. And Tenants Are Fighting Back.", "Date": "2016-12-10", "News": "Supported byDUBLIN \u2014 The Tobun family never missed a rental payment on their modest brick rowhouse in eight years. But in February, the couple, who have two young children, received a letter warning that they would have to leave their home when the lease expired. Forty of their neighbors got the same notice.When they went to investigate, the tenants, in the working-class suburb of Tyrrelstown, discovered a trail that led all the way to Wall Street.After Europe was ravaged by a financial and economic crisis, the giant investment bank Goldman Sachs snapped up huge swaths of distressed debt in Ireland, including the loans of Tyrrelstown\u2019s developer in 2014. The developer now wants out of the rental game and is selling the properties. As the owner of the loans, Goldman will reap a large portion of the proceeds.Goldman has nothing to do with the actions here. But because American banks have played such a large role in Europe\u2019s housing recovery \u2014 and have made huge profits in the process \u2014 they have become the main target of a growing backlash among homeowners and renters.\u201cSomehow, these funds have gotten involved in our community,\u201d Funke Tobun said. \u201cThey\u2019re profiting, but it\u2019s the people who are being made to suffer.\u201dThe firms have made the usual calculation: buy distressed investments on the cheap during tough times, betting that the outlook will eventually turn and riches will follow. And the firms are paying little or no tax, by employing complex strategies that often involve subsidiaries with no operations or staff.The huge profits and dubious tax strategies have made Wall Street a major object of frustration and anger, as people grapple with evictions and higher mortgage payments. In some cases, the Wall Street firms are passive players, the money men behind the landlords, developers or banks that are exerting force. In other cases, they are direct participants taking action.Despite the controversy, the firms \u2014 and their purchases \u2014 have played a vital role in the cleanup of Europe\u2019s mess.Wall Street stepped in, buying mortgages on commercial properties, rental developments and even individual homes. The much-needed cash helped mend national finances, halt plunging property values and clean up banks\u2019 books.\u201cInvestment by foreign capital has helped restart the system and accelerate the adjustment and recovery,\u201d a spokesman for Goldman, Sebastian Howell, said.But the recovery has been uneven, leaving homeowners and renters with few options after they run into trouble.Homeowners who have fallen behind are being pressured to accept harsher terms that could tilt them toward foreclosure. Residents are being plied with fees that make it harder to stay in their properties. And even tenants who have not missed rental payments are being forced out at a time when rising property values make it difficult to find affordable housing.Whether or not Wall Street is directly involved, activists are invoking the firms to fire up the masses. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that these funds are not mainstream banks or charities,\u201d said David Hall, director of the Irish Mortgage Holders Organization, a nonprofit that helps troubled homeowners. \u201cThey sell to make profit and they exit.\u201dProtesters have occupied empty apartments in Barcelona whose mortgages had been bought by Blackstone, and rallied around tenants in Madrid who were served eviction recently by a Goldman-run subsidiary. In Ireland, homeowners seeking protection have demonstrated outside Parliament.The deals are now getting a second look. The Spanish authorities are putting in place protections for tenants and homeowners. The Irish finance minister introduced legislation in October to tighten oversight of Wall Street\u2019s tax arrangements.In Tyrrelstown, tenants have asked the government to intervene, so they can remain in their homes. After receiving their lease termination notices, several families moved into a hostel.\u201cThey couldn\u2019t stand the pressure,\u201d Mrs. Tobun said. \u201cThey were scared of ending up homeless.\u201dFor decades, Tyrrelstown was a blank slate on the northwestern edge of Dublin, acres of rolling fields with just a few homes dotting the landscape.When Ireland joined the euro currency union in 1999, it all changed. Foreign capital flooded the country, and the economy soared. With seemingly endless growth in this so-called Celtic Tiger, banks made freewheeling loans to property developers like Rick and Michael Larkin, the brothers behind Twinlite, the developer that built Mrs. Tobun\u2019s home.The brothers undertook one of Ireland\u2019s most ambitious developments. More than 2,000 cookie-cutter-style homes were erected over vacant land that had at one point been targeted for a landfill. With three floors, modest kitchens and tidy backyards, the properties attracted teachers, police officers and other working-class tenants to an increasingly multicultural enclave.By 2006, the Larkins had added a sprawling retail center to Tyrrelstown along with a $40 million luxury four-star hotel, with 155 rooms, a fusion restaurant and an oak-paneled boardroom. At a ribbon-cutting ceremony, Bertie Ahern, then Ireland\u2019s prime minister, promoted the construction as \u201ca vote of confidence by its developers in the future of our economy.\u201dSimilar developments sprouted up across the country. By 2006, bank lending for development had grown in Ireland to more than \u20ac95 billion, from \u20ac5.5 billion in 1999. Construction comprised a quarter of the country\u2019s economic activity.Then the global financial crisis struck in 2008, and the Irish economy began to crumble. Despite warning signs, the Larkins kept building, unveiling plans for a \u20ac100 million, 11-story indoor ski slope and ice-climbing center. As the crisis deepened, city planners rejected the project.Many developers and homeowners could not pay their loans, leaving banks saddled with huge portfolios of troubled debt. Banks began frantically looking for ways to reduce their loads, even trying to get rid of the loans of borrowers like Twinlite that had not fallen behind. The government helped accelerate the process, setting up the National Asset Management Agency to package and sell off bad loans, a role that was expanded after Ireland\u2019s bailout in 2010.Wall Street firms saw opportunity, with loans selling at up to 70 percent off their face value. The firms bought nearly \u20ac100 billion worth of Irish distressed debt.Twinlite\u2019s loans in Tyrrelstown were among those picked up in the frenzy by Beltany Property Finance, a Goldman affiliate. Twinlite said it opposed the sale and sued the issuing bank, unsuccessfully, to have it halted.After that, Tyrrelstown residents faced two options: buy their properties or lose their homes..The County Council, to which Tyrrelstown residents had appealed for help, told Mrs. Tobun that a state-backed home loan might be available to purchase her property.. But Mrs. Tobun, who nets \u20ac1,000 a month caring for older people, could not afford the \u20ac16,000 down payment. Her husband, who drives a taxi, could expect to earn \u20ac40 on a 12-hour shift, compared with almost \u20ac150 before the crisis.Her worst fear, Mrs. Tobun said, was that her family might wind up among the growing ranks of the homeless.Mrs. Tobun does not have many options. She does not want to move farther out, since it would mean changing schools for her son who has special needs. A nearby rental is too expensive. Rents in Ireland have risen around 20 percent since the crisis as home construction dried up after the bust.Still, the effort showed that her home and the others in Tyrrelstown were worth much more as empty sales properties than as long-term rentals. In a statement, the Larkin family denied that Goldman\u2019s subsidiary exerted pressure to end the leases or sell. The statement said a Larkin-owned company wanted to exit the residential rental business, given regulatory changes and improving market conditions.For Tyrrelstown residents, the battles have been an all-consuming ordeal. After receiving a notice in May, Gillian Murphy and her partner, Damien Moore, refused to move from the home they had rented for six years. One of their three children has autism, and switching schools would put him at the bottom of the list for programs elsewhere.Soon after the family received the notice terminating their lease, two men working for the Larkin-owned entity arrived at their home and began taking pictures. \u201cEveryone is petrified of these people because we don\u2019t know who they are or what the purpose is,\u201d Ms. Murphy said.Before last year, few people in Ireland had heard of Cerberus Capital. Like other Wall Street players, Cerberus came into the country quietly, creating a local subsidiary under a different name and setting up a complex and extensive web of interconnected businesses.There are the 13 subsidiaries in Dublin, all with Promontoria in their names. They have no employees and no offices. They are all registered to the same address on Grant\u2019s Row, a letterbox near Parliament. Those subsidiaries, in turn, are subsidiaries of holding companies in the Netherlands, more than 110 of which had the Promontoria name.The structure has helped Cerberus profit in Ireland. Through the subsidiaries, Cerberus bought around \u20ac17 billion worth of loans on properties in Ireland and Britain in two years, for just under \u20ac6 billion euros. In Ireland alone, Cerberus has been earning hundreds of millions of euros in interest and other income.The setup, promoted by the Irish government along with other tax strategies, allows for a bit of tax magic that can make those profits seem to disappear.To buy the debt, Cerberus\u2019s Dutch Promontoria companies lent Cerberus\u2019s Irish Promontoria firms money at a high interest rate. The Irish businesses ended up paying roughly the same amount in interest that was earned on the real estate investments. Since the interest was deductible, Cerberus cut its tax bill drastically.One Irish subsidiary, Promontoria Eagle, which bought distressed loans in Northern Ireland and Britain, earned interest income in 2014 of 111 million British pounds on the deal, or around $140 million. After deducting interest charges and management and audit fees, taxable profit was only \u00a37,788. The resulting tax charge in Ireland: just \u00a31,947.Corporate filings for five other Irish subsidiaries of Cerberus, provided by DueDil, a corporate intelligence firm, show the same pattern: taxable profit and tax charges reduced to nearly identical numbers. Portfolios with up to \u00a31 billion worth of loans wound up with tax charges of less than \u00a32,000.Other Wall Street firms employed a similar method. Beltany, the Goldman subsidiary, earned interest income of \u20ac44 million on debt portfolios in Ireland at the end of 2014. After lowering taxable profit to \u20ac1,000, it netted a tax charge of \u20ac250, filings show.Lone Star collected interest income of more than $970 million at the end of 2014. Its taxable profit was just over $11 million, resulting in a tax charge of less than $1 million.\u201cWall Street firms have made a lot of profit from other people\u2019s misfortunes, and on top of that they\u2019ve systematically structured things so they pay almost no tax,\u201d said James Stewart, a finance professor at Trinity College, Dublin. \u201cSo what\u2019s their contribution to society?\u201dCerberus and Lone Star declined to comment. Goldman said that Beltany followed Irish law and that the interest it collected was subject to United States tax.On a warm summer day, 20 people crowded into a basement in central Dublin. The dimly lit room had recently been converted into makeshift headquarters for the Hub, a grass-roots operation that enlisted volunteer accountants and lawyers to help people who were facing eviction.David Walsh, a former firefighter living in Ballybunion, on the west coast of Ireland, drove six hours to attend the meeting. Two years ago, Lone Star\u2019s Irish affiliate had scooped up the mortgage on his family\u2019s award-winning bed-and-breakfast, the Ballybunion B&B, for a fraction of the original cost. He was angered that he had not been allowed to buy back his loan at the cheap price the fund received.Soon after, he said, the affiliate mounted an effort to increase his mortgage payments. In the crisis, his bookings had slumped badly, and his original bank had agreed to lower his monthly payments to \u20ac800 from \u20ac2,000.\u201cThey phoned me every day of the week and at night saying we have to increase the payments,\u201d Mr. Walsh said of the Lone Star affiliate.When the Hub\u2019s lawyers questioned the legality of Lone Star\u2019s ownership of his mortgage, Mr. Walsh diverted his loan payments into an escrow fund as a form of protest until the issue could be resolved. \u201cThe amount of harm being done to vulnerable people is immense,\u201d he said.Mr. Walsh was threatened with foreclosure, which he continues to fight.A broader rebellion has barreled ahead in Spain, where Blackstone, Goldman and other American firms bought residential properties, including subsidized rentals.While low-income rentals represent a small piece of their portfolios, the companies ignited a firestorm when they began evicting squatters, in an effort to improve property values. The activist group P.A.H. organized protests around Spain and outside Blackstone\u2019s New York headquarters.Blackstone and Goldman said they had evicted just a small number of squatters and aimed to keep renters in the properties long-term. Goldman said its policy was to help certain distressed tenants avoid eviction.The perceived invasion has prompted a political reassessment. Some Spanish regional authorities have passed laws intended to clamp down on Wall Street\u2019s involvement. Catalonia now requires firms to offer cheap alternative housing to tenants. The local authorities can also buy back homes or expropriate them if they are left empty for three years.So popular was the anti-eviction movement that Ada Colau, its main leader, was elected mayor of Barcelona last year. \u201cThe opacity and distance of a fund that is based much farther away makes it a lot harder to hold it responsible,\u201d she said.In Ireland, the Tyrrelstown episode has become a rallying cry.Housing advocates and lawmakers across the political spectrum are urging stricter oversight. Along with new legislation intended to close tax loopholes and restrict mass evictions, lawmakers are considering requiring banks and financial firms to follow a code of conduct and provide alternatives for troubled homeowners.But for Mrs. Tobun and other Tyrrelstown residents, such changes may offer little relief.Recently, she and her neighbors received word that their rents would rise sharply in the new year, after their current contracts expire. She said she and most of the 40 tenants affected would be unable to pay.The new rents will be closer to current market prices, but many residents suspect that the increase is a tactic being used to flush them out so the properties can be sold. In response, the Tyrrelstown community is planning another series of demonstrations.\u201cThis is a fight between David and Goliath,\u201d Mrs. Tobun said. \u201cThey want us out by force. All we can do is protest.\u201d\u201cWe believe in miracles,\u201d she added, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to win.\u201dAn article last Sunday about European residents\u2019 fighting back against Wall Street firms that have snapped up distressed housing debt referred imprecisely to notices that were given to some tenants. While the notices told them their leases were being terminated and that they would have to leave the property, they were not given eviction notices. The error was repeated in two accompanying picture captions. The article also referred incorrectly to a loan offered to one resident to help her buy her place. The County Council, not the developer, made the offer.Raphael Minder contributed reporting from Barcelona, and Douglas Dalby from Dublin.Advertisement"}

Next year, Mr. English, who was Mr. Key\u2019s finance minister and deputy prime minister, faces the challenge of winning a fourth consecutive election for the National Party.\u201cI want to be a prime minister where New Zealanders feel they can flourish here,\u201d Mr. English said at a news conference in Wellington on Monday. \u201cNot just some New Zealanders, all New Zealanders.\u201dNew Zealand political analysts said that while the National Party was expected to win the next election, the resignation of Mr. Key had given the left-wing Labour and Green Parties hope that they could still claim an unlikely victory.In explaining his decision to resign one year before his term ended, Mr. Key, a former Merrill Lynch executive, cited a desire to spend more time with his family and said he had never wanted to be a career politician.Analysts said Mr. English had his work cut out for him to replicate Mr. Key\u2019s popularity with voters.\u201cBill English is not a natural leader,\u201d Jon Johansson, a senior lecturer in the school of history, philosophy, political science and international relations at Victoria University in Wellington, said in a phone interview. \u201cHe is a technocrat, and that will make the task of the National Party winning a fourth consecutive term much more difficult.\u201dMr. Johansson put the chances of the National Party\u2019s winning the 2017 election at 50 to 60 percent. If Mr. Key had not stepped down, Mr. Johansson said, the party\u2019s chances would have risen to 90 percent.Still, Mr. English\u2019s steady stewardship of the New Zealand economy through the 2008 financial crisis counts in his favor. In 2016, economic growth has been 2.8 percent, and New Zealand\u2019s Treasury forecasts growth of 3.6 percent next year, with unemployment falling to 4.8 percent from the current 5 percent.\u201cHe\u2019s very experienced, and in political terms he is quite old,\u201d Colin James, one of New Zealand\u2019s best-known political commentators, said in an interview. \u201cIf he can maintain support for the National Party at around current levels, he will be well liked in the party.\u201dIn the 2014 election, the National Party got 47 percent of the vote. The Labour Party received 25 percent, and the Green Party received 11 percent. The National Party governs with the help of small right-wing parties.\u201cJohn Key dominated our politics and had his foot on the throat of the opposition for eight years,\u201d Mr. Johansson said.First elected to Parliament in 1990, Mr. English has also been a minister in charge of regulatory reform, education and health. He was sworn in as prime minister at a brief ceremony on Monday after Mr. Key formally resigned.A Catholic, Mr. English has opposed same-sex marriage, which became legal in New Zealand in 2013. Despite a reputation for lacking charisma, he displays a dry, laconic wit as a public speaker and has boxed publicly for charity. But in 2002, he led the National Party to its worst ever performance in a century, said Mr. James, the political commentator.Advertisement"}

She did not emerge from her official residence during that time, and her office has not explained what she was doing, though it has said she received updates and gave orders. In its impeachment bill, the National Assembly said Ms. Park\u2019s reticence undermined the people\u2019s right to know about the government\u2019s activities.On Thursday, the court appeared to agree.\u201cThat was such a day for the country that most people will remember what they were doing that day,\u201d Justice Lee Jin-sung said. \u201cI am sure she has such memories. We ask her to give us a thorough account of where in the Blue House she was in those seven hours, an hour-by-hour account of what official and private work she was doing then, and what reports and instructions she received and gave.\u201dThough Ms. Park\u2019s office said she was kept up to date about the disaster, her visit to an emergency management center later that day led some to conclude that she was not fully informed. At one point, she asked why it was difficult to find missing passengers when they had life jackets; an official had to remind her that the passengers were trapped inside the ship, which had overturned and all but disappeared below the water.The hearing on Thursday was brief and largely procedural, attended by only three of the court\u2019s nine justices, as well as lawyers representing Ms. Park and those appointed by the National Assembly to act as prosecutors. Two lone protesters stood outside the court, one supporting Ms. Park and the other calling for her impeachment, with a sign reading, \u201cThe 304 who died in the Sewol ferry are watching you!\u201d The next hearing was set for Tuesday.Ms. Park\u2019s approval ratings dropped to record lows in the weeks before her impeachment, and huge crowds filled central Seoul calling on her to resign or be removed from office.Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn is serving as acting president while Ms. Park is suspended. If the court removes her from office, a presidential election would be held 60 days later.On Thursday, the special prosecutor\u2019s office said it was asking the authorities in Germany to detain and extradite Ms. Choi\u2019s daughter, Chung Yoo-ra, who is believed to be there. The Foreign Ministry said Ms. Chung\u2019s passport would be invalidated if she did not return to South Korea.The special prosecutor is looking into allegations that Ms. Choi used millions of dollars from Samsung, South Korea\u2019s largest conglomerate, to finance her daughter\u2019s equestrian career and a luxurious lifestyle in Germany.A special prosecutor in South Korea has obtained a warrant to detain Ms. Chung for questioning. She is accused of illegally enrolling in Ewha Womans University in Seoul.Advertisement"}

It is also possible that Italy will move elections scheduled for 2018 forward in the wake of the resignation of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi after voters rejected a referendum on constitutional reforms this month. Candidates who are right-wing populists and friendly toward Russia are gaining ground across Europe, thanks, in part, to Russian interference along the lines of what Moscow was accused of doing in the United States. Russia\u2019s goals in Europe appear to be to elect foreign leaders who are sympathetic to Russian expansionism, to weaken NATO and to fan anti-European Union forces.There is strong evidence that Russia played a role in the defeat of the Italian referendum, as well as in the Brexit vote in June and a Dutch referendum in April in which voters rejected a treaty to strengthen ties between the European Union and Ukraine. The best way to ensure that Russia doesn\u2019t replicate these successes in elections next year is to expose its tactics before voters head to the polls.

{"Headline": "How the Twinkie Made the Superrich Even Richer", "Date": "2016-12-10", "News": "Bottom Line Nation | Part 4Behind the financial maneuvering at Hostess, an investigation by The New York Times found a blueprint for how private equity executives have amassed some of the greatest fortunes of the modern era.Supported byThe snack cakes flew through the air into the crowd pressed against metal barriers. One man shoved cream-filled treats into his mouth. Another \u201cToday\u201d host tucked Twinkies into the neckline of her dress.Across the nation in the summer of 2013, there was a feeding frenzy for Twinkies. The iconic snack cake returned to shelves just months after Hostess had shuttered its bakeries and laid off thousands of workers. The return was billed on \u201cToday\u201d as \u201cthe sweetest comeback in the history of ever.\u201dNowhere was it sweeter, perhaps, than at the investment firms Apollo Global Management and Metropoulos & Company, which spent $186 million in cash to buy some of Hostess\u2019s snack cake bakeries and brands in early 2013.Less than four years later, they sold the company in a deal that valued Hostess at $2.3 billion. Apollo and Metropoulos have now reaped a return totaling 13 times their original cash investment.Behind the financial maneuvering at Hostess, an investigation by The New York Times found a blueprint for how private equity executives like those at Apollo have amassed some of the greatest fortunes of the modern era.Stephen A. Schwarzman, a co-founder of Blackstone, took home the largest haul last year: nearly $800 million. He and other private equity executives receive more annually than the leaders of Facebook and Apple, companies that revolutionized the way society communicates.The top executives at those six publicly traded private equity firms earned, on average, $211 million last year \u2014 which is about what Leon Black, a founder of Apollo, received. That amount was nearly 10 times what the average bank chief executive earned, though firms like Apollo face less public scrutiny on pay than banks do.Private equity firms note that much of their top executives\u2019 wealth stems from owning their own stock and that they have earned their fortunes bringing companies back to life by applying their operational and financial expertise. Hostess, a defunct snack brand that was quickly returned to profitability, is a textbook example of the success of this approach.Yet even as private equity\u2019s ability to generate huge profits is indisputable, the industry\u2019s value to the work force and the broader economy is still a matter of debate. Hostess, which has bounced between multiple private equity owners over the last decade, shows how murky the jobs issue can be.In 2012, the company filed for bankruptcy under the private equity firm Ripplewood Holdings. Months later, with Ripplewood having lost control and the company\u2019s creditors in charge, Hostess was shut down and its workers sent home for good.Without investment from Apollo and Metropoulos, Hostess brands and all those jobs might have vanished forever after the bankruptcy. The way these firms see it, they created a new company and new jobs with higher pay and generous bonuses.But the new Hostess employs only 1,200 people, a fraction of the roughly 8,000 workers who lost their jobs at Hostess\u2019s snack cake business during the 2012 bankruptcy.And some Hostess employees who got their jobs back lost them again. Under Apollo and Metropoulos, Hostess shut down one of the plants they reopened in Illinois, costing 415 jobs.The collapse and revival of Hostess illustrates how even in a business success, many workers don\u2019t share in the gains. The episode also provides a snapshot of the economic forces that helped propel Donald J. Trump to the White House.Since losing his job at Hostess in 2012, Mark Popovich has had three jobs, including one that paid about $10 an hour, half what he made at the Twinkie-maker. A lifelong Democrat and devoted \u201cunion man,\u201d Mr. Popovich said he supported Mr. Trump, the first time he ever voted Republican.\u201cIt\u2019s getting old, getting bounced around all the time,\u201d said Mr. Popovich, a 58-year-old Ohio resident.Such frustrations stem from broader shifts in the economy, as all types of companies turn to automation to cut costs and labor unions lose their influence. While these changes have helped keep companies profitable, private equity has used these shifts in the workplace to supercharge wealth far beyond that of the typical chief executive.And yet, Mr. Trump did not focus on private equity on the campaign trail, instead blaming the plight of the American working class on a shadowy cabal of elitist Democrats and Wall Street bankers who support trade deals that ship jobs overseas.\u201cPeople understand jobs going to China,\u201d said Michael Hillard, an economics professor at the University of Southern Maine. \u201cBut no one has ever heard of these private equity firms that come in and do all this financial engineering. It is much more complicated and less visible.\u201d\u201cAt a time when many Americans are concerned about the country\u2019s economic viability, private equity has proven itself in communities throughout the United States as an effective solution,\u201d said James Maloney, the American Investment Council\u2019s spokesman. \u201cSustainable growth strategies, adherence to responsible investments and a long-view approach are all a part of the present-day private equity model.\u201dThe Times investigation of the Hostess deal shows that today\u2019s private equity also uses another set of tactics, like special dividends and tax arrangements, that maximize profits in creative, yet financially risky ways.Since the financial crisis, the private equity industry has become hugely influential. Here\u2019s how it plays out in your daily life.A year after the layoffs at the Hostess plant in Illinois, Apollo and Metropoulos arranged for the company to borrow about $1.3 billion. Apollo and Metropoulos used most of that sum to pay themselves, and their investors, an early dividend on their investment.The firms also found a way to make money even after the company was sold. The firms, The Times investigation found, struck a deal to collect as much as $400 million over the next 15 years, based on what Hostess\u2019s future tax savings might be.These winnings do not come without risk to the private equity firms, which are often taking a gamble on troubled companies, and when they fail, the firms probably lose out.And this is not a simple story of powerful investors enriching themselves while some workers struggle. Teachers and firefighters also benefit from private equity.Pension funds that pay retirement benefits to public servants now depend on private equity to generate huge returns. Without it, taxpayers could bear more of the costs.\u201cHostess\u2019s comeback was a win-win-win-win,\u201d an Apollo spokesman said in a statement, adding that its investment benefited workers, communities, investors and consumers. \u201cAfter teaming up to take on the daunting financial and operational challenge of creating a new company around the Hostess brand, Apollo and Metropoulos & Co. completed a highly successful private equity investment.\u201dOn a more basic level, Americans enjoy what private equity has owned: GNC vitamins, affordable jewelry at Zales, and birthday parties at Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s.It may seem an unusual choice, but this party had a special affinity for the snack cake. The bride\u2019s father is an executive at Apollo.Leon Black grew up in a family that had a home in Westport, Conn., and an apartment on Park Avenue in Manhattan. He attended Dartmouth and Harvard Business School.But when Mr. Black traveled to Lubbock, Tex., to speak to a group of retired teachers, he emphasized a humbler side of his pedigree.\u201cYou should know,\u201d Mr. Black said, according to a video recording of the February 2012 meeting, \u201cmy mother was a teacher, my sister was a teacher, my brother-in-law is a teacher. We have a lot of teachers in our family.\u201dMr. Black had good reason to flatter the retirees: Pension funds for teachers and other public workers are some of the biggest investors in Apollo\u2019s funds and have helped make Mr. Black a very rich man.Mr. Black, or an affiliated limited liability company, owns homes in Beverly Hills, Miami Beach and several locations in New York, an analysis of real estate records shows. This year, he bought the $38 million house in Beverly Hills that had belonged to the actor Tom Cruise.Private equity\u2019s relationship with pension funds is mutually beneficial. As countless baby boomers reach retirement at a time of historically low interest rates, public pension funds need to achieve returns that match their liabilities \u2014 and private equity has delivered.Nearly half of private equity\u2019s invested assets now come from public and private pensions around the world. Private equity uses this pension fund money to place bets on companies like Hostess, and Texas teachers have shared in the profits from the deal.The Teacher Retirement System of Texas has invested in the fund that bought Hostess. And that fund has reaped 27 percent net during the three years it owned Hostess, significantly more than the stock market returned in that period.\u201cYou need to get people in whom you trust and who will keep up our fund,\u201d said Fran Plemmons, a former president of the Texas Retired Teachers Association who was a teacher and principal for 25 years. \u201cIf they do that, you need to get out of the way.\u201dMs. Plemmons said her $31,200 yearly pension allows her to live modestly but comfortably. High returns from private equity investments, she said, help keep pension payments flowing to retired school workers across Texas, which trickles down into the local economy.For the teachers in Lubbock, Mr. Black described the \u201csecret sauce\u201d behind its success: buying the debt of financially troubled companies or purchasing an entire company. The investments, he said, are \u201cvalue-oriented, if not contrarian.\u201dHostess fit that formula.Not only were Americans turning to healthier snacks and eating less junk food, but Hostess had its own challenges.In 2012, the baking company had gone through a bruising bankruptcy, its second in a decade. The company laid off most of its 18,500 unionized drivers, loaders and bakers, not long after the bakers\u2019 union voted for a companywide strike rather than accept another round of concessions.But what was disaster for previous owners looked like treasure to Apollo and Metropoulos.When Hostess lenders auctioned off the company in early 2013, Apollo and Metropoulos bought some of Hostess\u2019s snack cake brands, which included Twinkies and Ding Dongs.Snack cakes still produced some of the highest profit margins in the food industry and Hostess cakes were particularly well-known. The bankruptcy also provided Apollo and Metropoulos a clean slate, liberating them from union contracts, labor rules and debt and pension payments.One group of workers who had no place at the new Hostess: the unionized drivers, who transported snack cakes and bread to grocery stores nationwide.Now, Hostess would send its baked goods to warehouses, where retailers like Walmart would ship to individual stores.Ronald Litland, 44, delivered Hostess products in Illinois for 10 years. After he was laid off in 2012, he enrolled in a for-profit college in hopes of finding a new career in information technology. When his unemployment benefits ran out, he delivered pizzas. He never finished school, but is still paying back student loans and taking care of his son.\u201cI have a hard time making ends meet,\u201d said Mr. Litland, who earns about $24,000 a year.Like the drivers, Hostess\u2019s baking operation was also cut back. Apollo and Metropoulos chose to buy only a handful of its roughly one dozen snack cake bakeries.Other parts of the former Hostess baking empire were scaled back as well. Food companies picked off some of Hostess\u2019s bread brands, but reopened only a small fraction of the bakeries.Before being laid off from Hostess, Mr. Popovich made about $20 an hour. Every year, he went on vacation in the Bahamas or St. Martin. His health insurance covered the $385,000 cost when his wife needed major surgery.\u201cI lived a good life,\u201d said Mr. Popovich, whose most recent job driving a forklift at a solar panel plant paid about $16 an hour.Mr. Popovich is also entitled to a pension, which he was promised after working more than two decades at Hostess. But he recently received a letter at his home in Toledo, Ohio, warning that the pension fund was nearly insolvent.Apollo and Metropoulos are not obligated to contribute to the pension fund, which is managed by a labor union. Nor do they have to pay the severance that Hostess was obligated to pay Mr. Popovich when he was laid off. Those liabilities were wiped out in the bankruptcy.At a brick bakery in Schiller Park, Ill., Twinkies started rolling off the line nearly a century ago. And when Apollo and Metropoulos bought some of Hostess\u2019s cake plants and brands out of bankruptcy in 2013, Schiller Park\u2019s plant was one of the fortunate few to reopen.\u201cSchiller Park, We \u2665 You,\u201d read a billboard that Hostess sponsored in the town, the heart carved into the image of a half-eaten Twinkie.The celebration was short-lived. Just over a year after the plant\u2019s grand reopening, Hostess shut it down.The fallout was swift. All 415 employees were fired, some for the second time in two years. Schiller Park lost one of its largest employers, creating a ripple effect through this tiny working-class suburb of Chicago. The plant itself, an institution so old that it predated nearby O\u2019Hare International Airport, was suddenly vacant.\u201cWe got our hopes up again,\u201d said the town\u2019s mayor, Barbara J. Piltaver. \u201cAnd then all of a sudden, we had a big hit.\u201dThe story behind the rise and fall \u2014 and fall again \u2014 of the Schiller Park plant encapsulates private equity\u2019s relationship with workers and labor unions.In Schiller Park, Janice Ryan worked at the Hostess plant for about 20 years before the 2012 bankruptcy. She walked to work from her nearby home. And she was relieved to return, after several months of unemployment, to be part of what many workers believed was the company\u2019s long-term comeback.Schiller Park was a starting point for getting Twinkies back on the shelves by summer 2013. As part of that push, many Schiller Park employees worked 12-hour shifts, six days a week, and could volunteer for a seventh day.\u201cWe were all proud of what we accomplished,\u201d said Michael Spina, who worked for Hostess for many years in St. Louis and then moved to Schiller Park to help manage production when the plant reopened.What the workers were never told, however, was that Apollo and Metropoulos had no plans to keep Schiller Park in operation over the long term.\u201cSchiller, in essence, was a contingency plan, opened only to ensure that initial demand could be met,\u201d Hannah Arnold, a Hostess spokeswoman, said in a statement. She added that the setup of the bakery \u2014 its low ceilings and lack of a loading dock \u2014 was not conducive to the company\u2019s future plans. The company says it could not tell workers of its plans because of labor rules.The expendability of Schiller Park reflects Apollo and Metropoulos\u2019s plans to run a more efficient operation than their predecessors did. And that model requires far fewer workers than the one that existed for decades.In 2012, Hostess had about 8,000 employees and eight bakeries dedicated exclusively to snack cakes. Six other plants produced at least some desserts. Today, the new Hostess has only three plants and 1,200 workers.At Schiller Park, some workers earned a dollar less per hour than what workers were paid under the previous owners. Others earned more, the company said. Still, they qualified for bonuses, owed no union dues and received health insurance and dental care. Instead of pensions, they were enrolled in 401(k) plans.Former employees recalled grueling shifts when temperatures inside the plant neared 110 degrees. The workers were given Gatorade to rehydrate.\u201cBakeries are hot places,\u201d Mr. Spina said. \u201cBut Schiller Park could really be a hot son of a bitch.\u201dVeronica Pacheco, who lives in Schiller Park and joined the Hostess bakery when it reopened in 2013, described \u201cfreezing\u201d wintertime conditions that were equally arduous. She said she wore scarves and heavy gloves under her work garments.Ms. Arnold, the Hostess spokeswoman, noted that prospective employees answered a questionnaire about whether they were willing to work in \u201cextreme seasonal temperatures.\u201d The company said it spent about $100,000 upgrading the heating and air-conditioning system, but stopped short of a total overhaul.There were other hazards as well. In 2014, Todd Kemp was injured after heaps of Twinkie mix spilled on the factory floor, causing him to slip and injure his shoulder, back and knee. He has since had four operations.Ms. Arnold said Apollo and Metropoulos inherited old equipment, some of it in disrepair, adding that Schiller Park \u201cwas in the worst condition of the four bakeries by far.\u201dC. Dean Metropoulos, the billionaire Greek immigrant whose firm has invested in other well-known food brands like Vlasic pickles and Pabst Blue Ribbon beer, personally oversaw the upgrading and cleaning of the facility, Ms. Arnold said.\u201cHe also focused on ensuring workers had new uniforms and better shoes, to make long days standing more comfortable,\u201d she said.Over the long term, Apollo and Metropoulos looked outside Schiller Park to generate profits.Hostess employed \u201cextended shelf-life technology\u201d to make the Twinkie, already jokingly thought to be capable of surviving nuclear war, even more everlasting.The company perfected its secret recipe until it contained the right amount of enzymes to better retain moisture. The enzymes extended shelf life of some products to 65 days from 26 days.The company also turned to automation. At a plant in Emporia, Kan., Hostess installed an automated baking system that churned out more cakes with fewer workers.William Toler, Hostess\u2019s chief executive, said the company spent more than $140 million \u201cto get the business up and running, and certainly our results suggest we made very good choices.\u201dThe Hostess plant in Columbus, Ga., had another advantage: government subsidies. The state\u2019s economic development agency provided Hostess with tax credits to push along the deal. The Town of Columbus chipped in a $1 million grant to award Hostess for creating jobs.\u201cWe\u2019re not doing it to be nice guys, we\u2019re doing it to create jobs,\u201d said Wylly Harrison, who worked on the deal for the Georgia Department of Economic Development and said that the state was thrilled Hostess came back.Hostess said it also received incentives from Emporia, the State of Indiana and the City of Indianapolis. Employment totals at those plants have since increased.Hostess did not receive any incentives in Illinois.Three workers interviewed by The Times said they believed that the final straw for Schiller Park was when they voted to rejoin a union.Hostess fought the effort. The company plastered the plant with posters urging workers to vote \u201cno.\u201dThe union prevailed, but not for long. Around the time union officials had planned to start contract negotiations in August 2014, Hostess announced it was shutting down the Schiller Park plant.Ms. Arnold, the Hostess spokeswoman, said the unionization vote did not factor into the decision to close Schiller Park. Employees, she said, were provided severance and an opportunity to apply for a Hostess job in another state.Union officials declined to comment.Since then, unions have made limited inroads at Hostess. Whereas 83 percent of the work force was unionized in 2012, Hostess recently said in a securities filing that about 30 percent of employees belonged to a union in Indianapolis and Columbus. Its flagship facility, Emporia, is not unionized.\u201cBoth Apollo and Metropoulos have owned and operated numerous companies that had union employees,\u201d Ms. Arnold said, adding that \u201cMetropoulos has always enjoyed good, working relations with unions and their members.\u201dFor all the profits Apollo and Metropoulos squeezed out of the Hostess factories, a deal hatched in a hotel room on Fifth Avenue in New York shows how private equity can have its snack cake and eat it, too.There, in the Versailles Room at the St. Regis, Apollo and Metropoulos began the process of extracting returns from the company, less than a year after shutting the Schiller Park plant.Most investors seeking profit have to wait for the right moment to sell a company or take it public. But private equity uses a different playbook.First, Apollo and Metropoulos arranged for Hostess to borrow money from the banking giant Credit Suisse. The two firms then pocketed about $900 million of that money for themselves and their investors. Hostess, meanwhile, is stuck repaying the debt.This type of deal is known as a dividend recapitalization, and it is a staple of private equity\u2019s money-making strategy. These deals provide private equity firms an opportunity to profit before they even sell a company, an added bonus to the firms and their investors, including public pensioners.Since 2012, private equity firms have arranged hundreds of such deals, totaling over $148 billion in debt, according to Thomson Reuters. Hostess\u2019s dividend deal was the third largest of 2015.This financial engineering is crucial to private equity\u2019s success \u2014 and to building the personal fortunes of the industry\u2019s executives. With each dividend recapitalization, more money pours into Apollo, which then flows to the firm\u2019s executives.It comes with risks. Of all the companies that carried out dividend recapitalizations since 2012, about 10 percent have faced a credit rating downgrade within six months of the deal, according to LCD/S&P Global Market Intelligence and Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings, which notes that many factors could lead to a downgrade, including excessive debt.Although Hostess has not been downgraded, it now describes itself in public filings as \u201chighly leveraged.\u201dMr. Toler, the Hostess chief, said that even after the dividend payout, the company \u201chad plenty of capital to work with.\u201dAt the same time it was paying dividends to investors, Hostess earmarked $8 million to pay bonuses to workers, including those in the bakeries.And still, they arranged more ways to profit. Apollo and Metropoulos retained a combined 42 percent stake in the company, which is now publicly traded.After investing only $186 million in cash when they bought the company in 2013 (they took out debt to help finance the rest of the $410 million deal), Apollo and Metropoulos\u2019s investment is now worth 13 times that initial cash investment.Tracing how these enormous returns wind their way into Mr. Black\u2019s pocket is a byzantine task.Mr. Black collected a $100,000 salary and no bonus in 2015.How did Mr. Black, on such a relatively modest salary, come to acquire an art collection that is said to include one of Edvard Munch\u2019s \u201c Scream\u201d series, which he bought in 2012 for about $120 million, then the highest price ever paid for a painting?The answer is that Mr. Black and other private equity executives make their money in ways that set them apart from most other industries.Mr. Black\u2019s share of the Hostess profits, from the partial sale and the $900 million in cash they pulled out of the company, will be reflected in a series of distributions he collects from Apollo\u2019s publicly traded stock. The size of the distribution depends on the size of the profits from deals like Hostess.Last year, Mr. Black\u2019s distributions totaled $181 million.Other shareholders in Apollo \u2014 which include money managers like Fidelity \u2014 also receive these distributions. But Mr. Black, as the largest shareholder of a company he co-founded in 1990, gets the largest payout.While Mr. Black receives the most money at Apollo, one of his partners and co-founders, Joshua Harris, took home $121 million last year. Mr. Harris is part owner of the Philadelphia 76ers and the New Jersey Devils.Mr. Black has noted that if Apollo\u2019s investments fail to make money, then its executives also miss out.Like most private equity firms, Apollo collects a management fee from investors and earns 20 percent of profits from the firm\u2019s investments, once its investors recoup their original money and reap profits of their own.Private equity\u2019s advantages don\u2019t end there. Apollo\u2019s share of the profits on Hostess or any deal ultimately flows to Mr. Black and his fellow shareholders in the company in ways that lower their tax burden.The industry\u2019s 20 percent cut of profits \u2014 also known as carried interest \u2014 is taxed at a long-term capital gains rate that is roughly half the 40 percent ordinary income rate for the nation\u2019s highest earners. And since private equity executives receive much of their money from carried interest \u2014 or in the case of Mr. Black, distributions largely made up of carried interest \u2014 they enjoy a tax advantage over workers.This is what\u2019s known as the \u201ccarried-interest loophole\u201d \u2014 a tax treatment held up during the presidential campaign as evidence that the rich fail to pay their fair share.Private equity managers argue that this treatment is not a loophole or even unique to private equity. Its use originated from the cut of profits that ship captains reaped for \u201ccarrying\u201d goods.In the Hostess deal, Apollo and Metropoulos found even more ways to use the tax code to their advantage.The firms are entitled to collect a large portion of tax benefits that Hostess could earn well into the future. The idea is that by selling a stake in Hostess before they could realize these benefits, Apollo and Metropoulos could leave money on the table.These arrangements, which are now commonplace in private deals, allow the firms to collect cash from a company they may no longer own.The Hostess \u201ctax-receivable\u201d benefits, according to previously unreported securities filings and estimates by the Apollo spokesman, could provide Apollo and Metropoulos up to $400 million for the next 15 years or more.Looking out over those next 15 years, nothing seems guaranteed to Mr. Popovich, the former Hostess worker from Toledo. Right before Thanksgiving, Mr. Popovich was laid off from his most recent job at the solar panel plant.The idea of searching for work at age 58 is daunting.

Ms. Barbizet will become vice chairwoman and will remain chief executive of the Art\u00e9mis Group, the investment company founded by Mr. Pinault.Mr. Cerutti, 50, is taking over at a time when the auction houses are struggling to fill their sales with inventory, given a hesitation among sellers to consign their prize artworks in light of political and economic uncertainty.\u201cThe demand is very strong and has remained very strong from new buyers and emerging buyers,\u201d Mr. Cerutti said. \u201cThe supply side is more challenging. We have to be ready to face this part of the cycle because we know we are in a cyclical business.\u201d Mr. Cerutti\u2019s experience in Asia will be important at a time when the region is the focus of increasing attention as fertile ground for new buyers.

Ms. Barbizet is vice-chair of the Kering Group.In January, Christie\u2019s announced total sales of $7.4 billion for 2015, down 5 percent over the previous year. The company is not required to report profitability on its sales, which can carry large guarantees, or promised minimum prices.But Mr. Cerutti said that he had confidence in the remaining team, which includes Stephen Brooks as deputy chief executive and Jussi Pylkkanen as global president \u2014 and was pleased that Mr. Gorvy would continue to work closely with Christie\u2019s from the outside.\u201cBrett is a great individual but he was also a member of the team and the team remains in place,\u201d Mr. Cerutti said, \u201cI\u2019m confident they will take over.\u201dMs. Barbizet ran Christie\u2019s from Europe, where she lives in Paris. Her other residence is in Manhattan on West 57th Street, but she spends much of her time on airplanes, visiting companies from America to Asia.

The Fairfax Financial boss Prem Watsa has drafted an airtight policy for the insurance company\u2019s $4.9 billion deal to buy its Swiss rival Allied World. And BlackBerry, where Mr. Watsa is both the lead director and a major investor, is trying to parlay its smartphone history into hands-free driving success.Fairfax\u2019s offer for Allied, unveiled on Sunday, looks anodyne on the surface. The 18 percent premium to combine two players in the property and casualty market is hardly over the top. But Allied will continue to operate as a stand-alone company, so there are no planned cost savings. Fairfax\u2019s pitch is that the deal will diversify its earnings \u2014 and that both firms have good track records.Mr. Watsa has taken some of the sting out of the premium tail for Fairfax investors: Half of the $900 million cash component will come from a special dividend Allied will pay to its own shareholders. Governance, though, is more troubling. Mr. Watsa owns 43 percent of Fairfax but is not excluding himself from the vote to approve the deal. It would be a more hands-off decision if he followed the example of Elon Musk, who earlier this year left it to the other shareholders to decide whether Tesla Motors and SolarCity should merge.Fairfax also wants written support from other big owners to tip approval past the 50 percent needed, perhaps avoiding a vote involving all shareholders. The company has also left itself the flexibility to switch most of the financing for the deal to cash, which would remove the need for any vote at all.Mr. Watsa\u2019s fingerprints may not be as visible in BlackBerry\u2019s decision to invest more in autonomous cars, but he runs the board and is a crucial voice at the once high-flying tech company. Back in 2013 he made an offer to buy it, a Fairfax investment firm is the second-largest shareholder, and Fairfax is BlackBerry\u2019s \u201cleading lender,\u201d according to its chief executive, John Chen.Driverless-car technology is not an absurd road for BlackBerry to follow. Its QNX division already has some expertise and has Ford Motor as a client. The problem is that there are plenty of more specialized, deeper-pocketed companies on the autonomous bandwagon already. Mr. Watsa may yet have to take a firmer grip at BlackBerry, too.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Quiet War on Medicaid", "Date": "2016-12-25", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorOf the two battles, the Republican effort to dismantle Medicaid is more certain. Neither Mr. Trump nor Senate Republicans may have the stomach to fully own the political risks of Medicare privatization. But not only have Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Tom Price, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for secretary of health and human services, made proposals to deeply cut Medicaid through arbitrary block grants or \u201cper capita caps,\u201d during the campaign, Mr. Trump has also proposed block grants.If Mr. Trump chooses to oppose his party\u2019s Medicare proposals while pushing unprecedented cuts to older people and working families in other vital safety-net programs, it would play into what seems to be an emerging strategy of his: to publicly fight a few select or symbolic populist battles in order to mask an overall economic and fiscal strategy that showers benefits on the most well-off at the expense of tens of millions of Americans.Mr. Price\u2019s own proposal, which he presented as the chairman of the House budget committee, would cut Medicaid by about $1 trillion over the next decade. This is on top of the reduction that would result from the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which both Mr. Trump and Republican leaders have championed. Together, full repeal and block granting would cut Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program funding by about $2.1 trillion over the next 10 years \u2014 a 40 percent cut.The emerging Republican plan to \u201crepeal, delay and replace\u201d the A.C.A. seeks to further camouflage these harmful cuts. Current Republican plans to eliminate the marketplace subsidies and A.C.A. Medicaid expansion in 2019 would create a health care cliff where all of the Medicaid funds and subsidies for the A.C.A. expansion would simply disappear and 30 million people would lose their health care.In the face of such a manufactured crisis, the Trump administration could cynically claim to be increasing Medicaid funding by offering governors a small fraction of the existing A.C.A. expansion back as part of a block grant. No one should be deceived. Maintaining a small fraction of the current Medicaid expansion within a tightly constrained block grant is not an increase.Some might whisper that these cuts would be harder to beat back because their impact would fall on those with the least political power. Sweeping cuts to Medicaid would hurt tens of millions of low-income and middle-income families who had a family member with a disability or were in need of nursing home care. About 60 percent of the costs of traditional Medicaid come from providing nursing home care and other types of care for the elderly and those with disabilities.While Republicans resist characterizations of their block grant or cap proposals as tearing away health benefits from children, older people in nursing homes or middle-class families heroically coping with children with serious disabilities, the tyranny of the math does not allow for any other conclusion. If one tried to cut off all 30 million poor kids now enrolled in Medicaid, it would save 19 percent of the program\u2019s spending. Among the Medicaid programs at greatest risk would be those optional state programs that seek to help middle-income families who become \u201cmedically needy\u201d because of the costs of having a child with a serious disability like autism or Down syndrome.Gene B.

A report by the regulator on Tuesday suggested it would formalize a cybersecurity review system on tech products in the country.Over the course of 2016 and part of 2015, a number of major foreign technology companies were subject to secretive Chinese security reviews. During the checks, Chinese officials would ask employees of the companies to answer questions about products in person. The reviews are run by a committee of engineers and experts with ties to the country\u2019s military and security agencies.The checks have already raised alarms among American tech companies, and if formalized, they could create a new standoff between China and the United States over internet policy.Beijing has struggled to balance its goal of fostering innovation with its desire to keep control over a communication medium it believes could be destabilizing. While it includes boilerplate references to opening up, the report makes clear that the government will continue to err on the side of control for now.The new report is the clearest signal yet of the government\u2019s intent to crystallize those checks into a formal policy.The document includes a long list of economic sectors that could be deemed sensitive, which could mean that they would eventually be required to use only computing equipment approved by regulators. The sectors include energy, finance, traffic, education, research, industry, water management, manufacturing and health care, as well as communications systems and the internet.To some degree, bringing the checks into the open would be welcome. Some people who were aware of the security checks on encryption and data storage complained that they were vaguely defined and treated as a secret. For foreign companies, that left open the possibility that the checks could be used to extract trade secrets or to find weaknesses in products for state hackers.Still, if China were to be more public about the checks, it could lead to copycat policies from other countries, analysts have said.Drafts of proposed Chinese laws are typically released to domestic and foreign companies for comment. In this case, the reviews were carried out without formal legislative process, meaning that companies had little room to push back.Cao Li in Beijing contributed research.Advertisement"}

Against a backdrop of pastel colors and an up-tempo beat, a diverse cast of athletes testified:\u201cI meditate to crush it.\u201d\u201cI meditate to not freak out.\u201d\u201cI meditate to have the edge.\u201dTheir pitch has new resonance on the heels of a bitter election. In the week after Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory in the presidential race, Headspace said it had experienced a 44 percent jump in its app\u2019s \u201cSOS\u201d meditation, a sort of panic button for the frazzled. Yet even without an anxious electorate, Headspace was finding an audience.A standout among a group of websites, apps and consulting firms that are seeking to capitalize on the current craze for all things mindful, the Headspace app has been downloaded more than 11 million times.With its coffers full from a recent funding round befitting a Silicon Valley social media darling, Headspace is now aiming to convert millions more people with advertisements on network television and posters plastered on New York City bus stops and subway stations.Yet even as Headspace finds its groove, questions linger about just how broad its appeal can be, and whether the app\u2019s creators can back up their aspirational claims with real science.\u201cThe cheerleading phase is over,\u201d said James Gimian, publisher of Mindful magazine. \u201cPeople know mindfulness can be a good thing. Now people need to do research into what the benefits are in specific applications.\u201dThe two men agreed to barter: Mr. Puddicombe would teach Mr. Pierson how to meditate in exchange for help in developing something with mass market potential.By 2012, they had their first app. Mr. Puddicombe, with his chummy British accent, honed and narrated the teachings, which were delivered through a mix of cartoons, videos of Mr. Puddicombe and podcasts. And the app gained decent traction, for a meditation app at least.But in 2013, the pair moved the company from London to Los Angeles. England, Mr. Pierson said, is \u201cone of the most cynical markets in the world,\u201d and the co-founders were optimists. Also, they wanted to surf.In 2014 they updated the app. Before that relaunch, they had fewer than one million downloads. Since then, growth has taken off. Last year Headspace raised $30 million in a financing round led by the Chernin Group and rounded out by celebrities including Jared Leto and Jessica Alba.Today, Headspace claims to employ 160 people at offices in Los Angeles, London and San Francisco. The company doesn\u2019t disclose revenue.What Headspace is selling is deceptively simple. By instructing people to focus on their breathing and let go of thoughts and emotions, Mr. Puddicombe gently coaxes users back to fuller engagement with the present moment. In modern parlance, it is mindfulness \u2014 a quick, secularized adaptation of Buddhist teachings that have been distilled for a modern, Western audience. A 10-day course on the app is free. Annual subscriptions cost about $100.For this price, the goal is not so much enlightenment as it is stress relief and self-care.\u201cIt\u2019s great if people think it can help them with sleep and productivity and the rest, but really what we\u2019re trying to do is get them to be more compassionate,\u201d Mr. Pierson said. \u201cAnd wouldn\u2019t that be an amazing skill for the world to learn at the moment?\u201dOf course, compassion wasn\u2019t what Headspace was pitching in the commercials that aired during the football game. And therein lies one of the inherent tensions with a for-profit meditation company: In the rush to expand a business, it\u2019s easy to misrepresent, oversell or exaggerate the benefits of a product, especially something as mercurial as mindfulness.In particular, some claim that Headspace has gone too far in trying to appeal to those in fragile emotional states by offering meditation courses devised to treat depression.\u201cThe problem I have with Headspace is the way they\u2019ve expanded their content to target vulnerable populations,\u201d said Zindel Segal, a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto, and the co-developer of Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy, a meditation-based treatment for depression.\u201cThey have no research that validates the claims they are making in this area,\u201d Professor Segal said, \u201cyet their business model requires that they constantly grow their user base.\u201dHeadspace says it is sensitive to these concerns.\u201cScience is one of those things we take really seriously,\u201d Mr. Pierson said. Headspace has dozens of studies going on, employs many scientists who are building on the already voluminous body of research documenting meditation\u2019s potential benefits, and says it will publish more research soon.Mr. Pierson also noted that Headspace tells users to seek professional help if they have severe depression and said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t meant to replace medication.\u201dYet in the end, Mr. Pierson was somewhat defiant.\u201cWe are just trying to put stuff out there that will help people,\u201d he said. If meditation and mindfulness can cheer someone up, is a peer-reviewed study really necessary?What\u2019s more, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think Western science has a monopoly on the human condition.\u201dWhen it comes to another growing market opportunity \u2014 the business of selling meditation offerings to corporations \u2014 Headspace has exhibited restraint. There is no special version of the app for enterprise customers, and Headspace says less than half of a percent of all subscriptions are paid for by companies as a benefit to employees.\u201cI worry about people getting it from H.R.,\u201d Mr. Pierson said. \u201cIf companies are going to promote it, I want them to do it not just because of productivity, but because they want their teams to be healthier and happier.\u201dIn the meantime, Headspace will hope to capitalize on the nation\u2019s lingering unease.\u201cMeditation helps you be more comfortable with the uncomfortable,\u201d Mr. Pierson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve definitely seen a bump in usage postelection.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Detroit and the Pistons Are One Again", "Date": "2016-12-12", "News": "Supported byOn Pro BasketballMotown is not going back to Detroit but the Pistons are. This recent news, capping a standup year of N.B.A. social activism and outspokenness, was soul-cleansing music to Dave Bing\u2019s ears.\u201cThe return of the franchise with the moniker of Detroit that wasn\u2019t in Detroit,\u201d said Bing, who spent nine years of his 12-season, Hall of Fame career with the Pistons \u2014 when they were part of the city \u2014 before becoming a business leader there and eventually the mayor.When Bing, a 6-foot-3 guard, was launching feathery jumpers for the Pistons in the old Cobo Arena on Washington and Jefferson Avenues, from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s, Detroit was as much a celebrity magnet as more renowned league sites in Los Angeles and New York.The coastal elites may still believe that they alone fostered the hot-ticket marriage of entertainment and sports, but let\u2019s allow Bing to drop a few enlightening names.\u201cI already knew Marvin Gaye because we grew up in the same neighborhood in D.C.,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cBut the Four Tops were at the games, the Temptations, Diana Ross. It was a fashion show every night.\u201dBy the late 1970s, a decade after horrific riots, the Pistons had fallen on hard competitive times, along with the city, and out they went to a charmless football dome in distant Pontiac, Mich., and later to the basketball-specific Palace of Auburn Hills.A team in a sport played increasingly by young black men fled the city while hockey\u2019s white-as-ice Red Wings stored their gloves and sticks in a downtown arena named for Joe Louis.Mike Abdenour, the Pistons\u2019 trainer since 1975, except for a three-year run with the Philadelphia 76ers, grew up on Detroit\u2019s East Side, occasionally riding the bus with his brother to Cobo.\u201cThe tickets cost $5,\u201d he said, and that is why, he reasoned, Bill Davidson, the owner who moved the team, couldn\u2019t be blamed for doing so when ticket prices began to rapidly rise leaguewide, along with salaries.The fan base in the city could no longer afford to support the Pistons, Abdenour said, adding that the Red Wing crowds were already largely suburban, fiercely loyal and undeterred by ticket costs.That\u2019s one rationale. For his part, Bing recalled Davidson not getting along with Coleman Young, Detroit\u2019s mayor at the time.Too young to wonder or to worry about why one team left and the other stayed was Tom Gores, an adolescent Pistons fan and future owner of the team. At the time, he was about to embark on his own high school basketball career a little more than an hour away, in a small Michigan town a few miles northeast of Flint.Gores went on to become a billionaire creator of the Beverly Hills-based Platinum Equity, and in 2011 he bought the Pistons from the Davidson family (after Bill Davidson\u2019s death in 2009) for a now-bargain $325 million.In an interview, he said the racial incongruity of the Pistons\u2019 uprooting was not something that jumped out at him as he grew older. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019ve never really thought about it that way,\u2019\u2019 he said.Still, it was Gores who announced last month that the Pistons would end their 39-year self-exile from Detroit next season by becoming co-tenants with the Red Wings in the new Little Caesars Arena. With the N.F.L.\u2019s Lions back downtown since 2002, and baseball\u2019s Tigers having never left, the Pistons\u2019 return will situate four major professional teams within blocks of one another, with Gores targeting a Major League Soccer franchise as a potential fifth.On the phone, Gores, 52, said: \u201cI think everybody felt that without the Pistons it just wasn\u2019t complete. We were the missing family member.\u201dFamily business mattered, too. The Palace has not exactly been packed in recent years, in large part because the Pistons haven\u2019t been very good.When Bing was mayor, from 2009 to 2013, he spoke of luring the Pistons back, but his tenure ended with the largest municipal bankruptcy debt filing in United States history. Times have changed, mostly in terms of downtown commercial development.\u201cThere\u2019s so much going on and I don\u2019t think the Pistons wanted to be on the outside looking in,\u201d he said.Naturally, and justifiably, some have voiced objections to the hundreds of millions in bond subsidies floated by the Detroit Downtown Development Authority to help finance the arena and, in addition, make it basketball-ready.Adam Silver, the N.B.A. commissioner, argued that the investment would be worth it, tangibly and otherwise.The Pistons, he wrote in an email, \u201cwould be contributing greatly to the economic revitalization of the city as well as its civic psyche\u201d and would be \u201cthe continuation of a trend we\u2019ve seen around the country of professional sports teams moving back into downtown areas, positively impacting urban development.\u201dDepending on the financial arrangements, sometimes, yes. Other times, no. And depending upon the point of view (talk to the opposing factions in Brooklyn about Barclays Center), yes and no.Even the choice of locality can be complex. The Golden State Warriors, for example, want to become more citified in upscale San Francisco, but defenders of their longtime home along an interstate on the outskirts of Oakland argue that would be a betrayal of a diverse and vociferous fan base that has supported the team through far more bad times than good.So, too, did the suburban crowds in Auburn Hills, where the Pistons won championships in 1989, 1990 and 2004.\u201cLots of great things happened at the Palace,\u201d said Gores, who is still trying to determine the fate of a building also remembered for a disturbing occasion when push came to shove and caused leaguewide shame.That would be the so-called Malice at the Palace in 2004, when Ron Artest and some of his Indiana Pacers teammates brawled in the stands with belligerently provocative Pistons fans.Bing, then the owner of a large steel company, said the mayhem resulted in \u201cDetroit getting a black eye when it had nothing to do with it.\u201d The Pistons\u2019 franchise got a lesson in civics and the pitfalls of myopic upward mobility.Now 73, Bing runs a mentoring program in Detroit, matching at-risk boys with adult men, a few of whom played for the Pistons.\u201cBut I\u2019m one of the few guys left who actually played at Cobo,\u201d he said.He wondered if his interviewer had ever covered a game at what is now a convention hall known as the Cobo Center. He was told, yes, in early 1978. The place was a classic hothouse of condensed fan frenzy. But the reporter told Bing that his most memorable game in Detroit over a long reporting career was not at Cobo, or in the suburbs.It was in April 1984, a decisive Game 5 of a first-round Knicks-Pistons playoff series, moved downtown to Joe Louis Arena because the Pontiac Silverdome was previously booked. On a night made steamy by faulty ventilation, Isiah Thomas scored a remarkable 16 points for the Pistons in a 1-minute-33-second span to force overtime, before Bernard King, averaging 43 points for the series and playing with the flu, won it for the Knicks.Never before had they played pro basketball at Joe Louis Arena, and never was it more obvious that the Pistons shouldn\u2019t have left Detroit.No one ever believed that more than Bing.\u201cIt\u2019s the city game,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this is long overdue.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "2 Former Flint Emergency Managers Charged Over Tainted Water", "Date": "2016-12-20", "News": "Supported byFLINT, Mich. \u2014 A criminal investigation into this city\u2019s water crisis reached into the top ranks of supervision over Flint on Tuesday as Michigan officials announced felony charges against two former state-appointed emergency managers, accusing them of fixating on saving money rather than on the safety of residents.The managers, who were appointed by Gov. Rick Snyder to lead Flint out of fiscal distress, were charged over their roles in the public health crisis prompted by the city\u2019s switch to a new water source, as well as the delays in responding to residents\u2019 complaints as they suffered the devastating effects.\u201cAll too prevalent in this Flint water investigation was a priority on balance sheets and finances rather than health and safety of the citizens of Flint,\u201d said Mr. Schuette, a Republican who is seen as a possible candidate for governor in 2018.Charges of false pretenses, conspiracy to commit false pretenses, misconduct in office and willful neglect of duty lodged against the former managers, Darnell Earley and Gerald Ambrose, were lauded by Flint leaders, some of whom said they had feared that blame for the city\u2019s contaminated water might ultimately be pinned only on low-level workers.The claims also reopened a longstanding debate in Michigan over the state\u2019s emergency management provision, reviving questions about whether the system removes power and control over local issues from those residents who come under state oversight.For years, governors here have appointed emergency managers as a way to efficiently cut debts and restore financial stability in the most troubled cities. But residents of some majority-black Michigan cities, including Flint, argue that the intense state-assigned oversight disenfranchises voters, shifts control from mostly Democratic cities to the state\u2019s Republican-held capital and risks favoring financial discipline over public health.Mayor Karen Weaver said that she was thankful Flint was now getting this level of \u201caccountability,\u201d but that the entire episode revealed a fundamental flaw of state-ordered oversight in any city. \u201cThat\u2019s what was missing when we had an emergency manager,\u201d Ms. Weaver said. \u201cOur voice was taken.\u201dShe said she saw the charges as an indication that the investigation may reach still higher.The state criminal investigation into Flint\u2019s water crisis, opened in January, previously had led to charges against one employee of Flint\u2019s water plant and eight state officials, including a state epidemiologist and the former leader of Michigan\u2019s municipal drinking water office.Of those nine, two have accepted plea deals. The rest are awaiting trial, and some have sought the dismissal of the charges against them.On Tuesday, two additional Flint officials were also charged with crimes. Howard Croft, a former director of the city\u2019s Public Works Department, and Daugherty Johnson, a former utilities director for the department, were accused of false pretenses and conspiracy to commit false pretenses.Since it was in financial distress, Mr. Schuette said, Flint was not permitted to borrow money unless it could prove a significant emergency. To get a state waiver, the city claimed it needed the money for an emergency cleanup of a retention pond. But Mr. Schuette said the money was actually intended for the long-term water project.Mr. Schuette said they also agreed, as part of that project, to switch temporarily to Flint River water, even though they knew the city\u2019s treatment plant was not ready to handle the treatment necessary to prevent contamination.In the end, officials failed to properly treat the new water with chemicals that would prevent materials from corroding and leaching metals like lead.In the months that followed, Flint residents complained that their tap water had puzzling, murky colors and vile smells, and that they were feeling ill or suddenly suffering from rashes. But officials discounted or overlooked a growing body of evidence that something was wrong with the water, emails and testimony have suggested.Mr. Ambrose is also accused of obstructing efforts by the local health department to investigate the deadly Legionnaires\u2019 disease outbreak.If convicted of all charges, Mr. Earley and Mr. Ambrose could face up to 46 years in prison, and Mr. Croft and Mr. Johnson could face up to 40 years. Edwar Zeineh, a lawyer for Mr. Johnson, said his client maintained his innocence, and was a worker\u2019s worker who had retired from the city and \u201cserviced the citizens to the best of his ability throughout his career.\u201d Lawyers for the other three men could not be reached.During Governor Snyder\u2019s tenure, several cities, including Flint, Detroit, Benton Harbor, Pontiac and Hamtramck, have had emergency managers in place.Flint, a Democratic stronghold of just under 100,000 residents, was wrestling with dire budget conditions in 2011, when Mr. Snyder appointed an emergency manager. Nine years earlier, another Republican governor, John Engler, had taken the same action here, appointing a manager who stayed in place for two years.Some critics of the emergency manager provision in this state said the charges here should be seen as a broad warning about the dangers of the policy. Representative Dan Kildee, a Democrat who represents Flint in Congress, said they were \u201can indictment against the administration\u2019s failed emergency manager law that contributed to this crisis.\u201dMelissa Mays, a Flint resident and activist on the city\u2019s water crisis, said it was a significant step that the state-appointed managers would be held to account. \u201cThe biggest thing for us is to see the emergency managers on there because for the longest time we were told they were untouchable.\u201dStill, Ms. Mays said, all these months later, residents do not trust the drinking water. Lead levels in Flint\u2019s water have improved over the last year, officials say, as they have worked to solve the city\u2019s problem. But residents are still being advised not to drink tap water unless they have a water filter. And many residents say they are uncomfortable drinking anything but bottled water anymore. Officials had told them that the water was safe when it was not, they say, so why should they believe it is safe now?Mr. Schuette was noncommital on suggestions that the investigation might lead to higher levels of state government, given that the managers were put in place by the state. But the investigation is not over, he said.Anna Heaton, a spokeswoman for Mr. Snyder, said in a statement that the charges were \u201cserious accusations that should be moved through the legal process as soon as possible\u201d and that Mr. Snyder would continue trying to assist Flint. She did not respond to questions about the emergency manager law.\u201cWe remain steadfast in our commitment to helping the people of Flint recover,\u201d Ms. Heaton said, \u201cwhich is evident in the support the state has provided regarding water quality and resources, educational improvements, expansion of health care and economic development.\u201dMonica Davey reported from Flint, and Mitch Smith from Monona, Wis.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Building a Media Empire, What\u2019s Next? Lifting One Million From Poverty", "Date": "2016-12-30", "News": "Supported byThe Saturday ProfileNATE, India \u2014 Ronnie Screwvala sat cross-legged early last month on the floor of a three-room schoolhouse here in Nate, a village about 100 miles from Mumbai, the city of his birth where he built a billion-dollar media conglomerate. Watching a group of children playing with colorful educational games, Mr. Screwvala, a boyish-looking 54-year-old, appeared as wide-eyed and engaged as the students.The foundation\u2019s mission seems virtually impossible. It aims to lift one million villagers in Maharashtra State out of poverty within six years, and then help them build better lives.The foundation currently concentrates on a cluster of about 2,000 villages in the state\u2019s Raigad District, a total of 110,000 households and more than half a million people. It offers school-based educational support and teaching tools, health and nutrition programs, water and sanitation projects and agricultural and job training.\u201cWe\u2019re applying all the same models we used to build our company,\u201d Mr. Screwvala said, noting that the foundation carefully quantifies the success or failure of its initiatives, making adjustments along the way.Because Swades is independently financed, he said, \u201cwe have the advantage of starting up projects without delay under our own steam.\u201dIn the area of water supply and sanitation, Swades says it has built 10,889 toilets for individual homes and 733 water storage structures that provide drinking water to 82,109 people.For its work on health and nutrition issues, the foundation notes the formation of 1,863 self-help groups, training for 1,059 community health workers, vision tests for 177,123 people, the distribution of 32,500 free pairs of eyeglasses and 5,873 free cataract operations.The foundation says it also has trained 4,895 teachers and principals, offered computer and English literacy classes to 36,000 students and awarded scholarships to more than 2,500.And it claims to have introduced 20,000 farmers to new farming technologies, planted thousands of mango and cashew trees and set up 1,411 people with dairy cows and 1,214 others with poultry for eggs and meat.The Screwvalas say they hope to raise a generation of socially conscious middle-class Indians, and perhaps the next wave of Indian entrepreneurs.\u201cYou have the means and the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of those less fortunate than you,\u201d Mr. Screwvala told the Cathedral and John Connon students. \u201cGet involved in social activism.\u201dA half-hour later, Mr. Screwvala walked through a small cashew processing plant in the village of Nate Khind. Swades \u2014 the name means \u201cone\u2019s own country\u201d \u2014 supports 20 such cashew processing units and hopes to expand to 100.While several women separated the nuts from the shells by hand, about 30 cashew farmers and processors eagerly asked for his advice and help. But he was more interested in what they had to say, asking them questions and listening intently to their concerns.Their biggest obstacle is securing bank loans to expand production, they said. The bank wants collateral, but the villagers have only cashews to offer, which the bank will not accept. The villagers asked if Mr. Screwvala would lend them the money.\u201cBut that will perpetuate your dependence on me,\u201d he responded, offering to meet with the local loan officer instead.\u201cIf we get the message across, even all those women shucking shells can become entrepreneurs once these processing plants get so big they run out of space,\u201d he said later. \u201cThe women could suggest becoming independent contractors, processing from their homes, even hiring other women.\u201dAs the day went on, he met with others involved in Swades-supported projects: farmers developing new crops; young people studying at a skills training center; a chicken farmer; and people at a newly built water tank and a mobile eye-examination van.On the drive back to Mumbai, he conceded that the foundation\u2019s goal of reversing the centuries-old problems of rural India was enormously ambitious. But the Screwvalas are no strangers to disrupting the status quo.After the 2012 Disney deal, and a 10-day family vacation to New Zealand, the Screwvalas got right back to work.In addition to forming Swades, he has started an online education company, a sports development company and a new film production company, and he has assembled a venture capital portfolio of about 15 businesses.\u201cWe\u2019d already started a small nonprofit called Share in 2000,\u201d said Ms. Screwvala, sitting at her writing desk in the couple\u2019s apartment in Mumbai. The name is an acronym for Society to Heal, Aid, Restore, Educate. \u201cWe were doing good works, but one day Ronnie came to me and said, \u2018Let\u2019s lift a million people out of poverty.\u2019 The idea was breathtaking. This was shortly after the Disney acquisition and I was wondering myself what to do next.\u201dA petite woman with an infectious enthusiasm, she spoke passionately about the lessons she was learning with Swades. \u201cWe did a lot of research, talking to leading experts, before we launched,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone admired our ambition but told us we would fail. When someone tells us we will fail, it only strengthens our resolve. It\u2019s been the most difficult work I\u2019ve ever done, the hardest part being changing mind-sets and building aspiration among poor people.\u201dMs. Screwvala said she was inspired to take on the challenge in part by a quotation from the ancient Chinese philosopher Laozi that seemed to speak directly to her: \u201cWhen I let go of what I am, I become what I might be.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to one of UTV\u2019s ventures. It involves video games, not gambling.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Analytics of Trade Deficits and Manufacturing Employment (Very Wonkish)", "Date": "2016-12-26", "News": "Still, the critique inspired me to get a bit more formal about the analytics, and there is a small clarification I think I should make.So here\u2019s how I think about it (which is actually a fairly standard trade model approach): approximate the economy as consisting of two sectors, traded and nontraded, with traded goods being basically manufacturing. Assume full employment for the sake of argument; then production is always on the production possibility frontier, which is the downward-sloping line in the figure.With balanced trade, production = consumption (plus investment, but lump them together); that\u2019s point A. When the economy runs a trade deficit, however financed, consumption lies outside the PPF, at a point like B; this point normally involves moving out an expansion path along which consumption of both nontraded and traded goods rises. However, the increase in nontraded consumption must be met out of domestic production, which means that traded production falls.So a trade deficit in manufacturing does correspond to a fall in manufacturing production.Bottom line: yes, trade deficits reduce manufacturing production and jobs. They played a significant although far from dominant role in manufacturing job losses after 2000.Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s Trump\u2019s Economy Now. What Will He Do With It?", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byTaking NoteThe November jobs report, released on Friday, is a snapshot of the economy that President-elect Donald Trump will inherit from President Barack Obama. According to the report, the economy added 178,000 jobs last month. In November 2008, as Mr. Obama prepared to take office, the economy lost 769,000 jobs.The latest report also shows an unemployment rate last month of 4.6 percent and an underemployment rate of 9.3 percent. In November 2008, those were 6.8 percent and 12.6 percent, respectively.Mr. Trump should be thanking Mr. Obama and the legislators (almost exclusively Democrats) who backed Mr. Obama on fiscal stimulus, the auto bailout and health care reform, all of which laid the foundation for the improved economy that now awaits him.Instead, he is on a \u201cthank you\u201d tour, reprising his campaign themes about making America great again.The last several years have seen steady if modest growth in jobs; more recently, job growth has begun to translate into wage gains. But there is still considerable slack. The percentage of people working or actively looking for work remains at a historic low of 62.7 percent, which indicates that human capital is being wasted. At the current pace of job growth, it would take about another year for the labor market to be hitting on all cylinders.In the meantime, however, the Trump economic agenda, if enacted, will tilt conditions against working people. Mr. Trump wants to give huge tax cuts to the rich, which won\u2019t put money in workers\u2019 pockets. He wants increased spending on infrastructure, but would rely mainly on private investors rather than public financing, an approach that tends to enrich investors at the expense of the taxpayers. Taken together, those polices would increase the budget deficit, which would mean either higher national debt or deep federal spending cuts. It would be reasonable to increase the debt to boost the long-term health of the country, but tax cuts for the rich and subsidies for private investors won\u2019t do that. Federal spending cuts would harm working people because they would reduce the support the government provides directly in areas such as health, education and anti-poverty initiatives, as well as the support it supplies to the economy and society through environmental protection, scientific research, bank regulation and law enforcement.The Trump agenda, if enacted, could boost growth in the near term. But that growth would be likely to enrich those at the top of the economic ladder and leave everyone else no better off.Mr. Trump is inheriting a steady if unspectacular economy. He seems intent on transforming it into something that is spectacularly unsteady.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Scourge of Racial Bias in New York State\u2019s Prisons", "Date": "2016-12-03", "News": "A New York Times investigation draws on nearly 60,000 disciplinary cases from state prisons and interviews with inmates to explore the system\u2019s inequities and the ripple effect they can have.Supported byThe racism can be felt from the moment black inmates enter New York\u2019s upstate prisons.They describe being called porch monkeys, spear chuckers and worse. There are cases of guards ripping out dreadlocks. One inmate, John Richard, reported that he was jumped at Clinton Correctional Facility by a guard who threatened to \u201cserve up some black mashed potatoes with tomato sauce.\u201d\u201cAs soon as you come through receiving, they let you know whose house it is,\u201d said Darius Horton, who was recently released from Groveland Correctional Facility after serving six years for assault.Most forbidding are the maximum-security penitentiaries \u2014 Attica, Clinton, Great Meadow \u2014 in rural areas where the population is almost entirely white and nearly every officer is too. The guards who work these cellblocks rarely get to know a black person who is not behind bars.Whether loud and vulgar or insinuated and masked, racial bias in the state prison system is a fact of life.It is also measurable.A review by The New York Times of tens of thousands of disciplinary cases against inmates in 2015, hundreds of pages of internal reports and three years of parole decisions found that racial disparities were embedded in the prison experience in New York.In most prisons, blacks and Latinos were disciplined at higher rates than whites \u2014 in some cases twice as often, the analysis found. They were also sent to solitary confinement more frequently and for longer durations. At Clinton, a prison near the Canadian border where only one of the 998 guards is African-American, black inmates were nearly four times as likely to be sent to isolation as whites, and they were held there for an average of 125 days, compared with 90 days for whites.A greater share of black inmates are in prison for violent offenses, and minority inmates are disproportionately younger, factors that could explain why an inmate would be more likely to break prison rules, state officials said. But even after accounting for these elements, the disparities in discipline persisted, The Times found.The disparities were often greatest for infractions that gave discretion to officers, like disobeying a direct order. In these cases, the officer has a high degree of latitude to determine whether a rule is broken and does not need to produce physical evidence. The disparities were often smaller, according to the Times analysis, for violations that required physical evidence, like possession of contraband.Blacks make up only 14 percent of the state\u2019s population but almost half of its prisoners. Racial inequities at the front end of the criminal justice system \u2014 arrest, conviction and sentencing \u2014 have been well documented.The degree of racial inequity and its impact in the prison system as documented by The Times have rarely, if ever, been investigated. Nor are these issues systematically tracked by state officials. But for black inmates, what happens inside can be profoundly damaging.Bias in prison discipline has a ripple effect \u2014 it prevents access to jobs and to educational and therapeutic programs, diminishing an inmate\u2019s chances of being paroled. And each denial is likely to mean two more years behind bars.A Times analysis of first-time hearings before the State Board of Parole over a three-year period ending in May found that one in four white inmates were released but fewer than one in six black inmates were.Even well-run prisons are dangerous. There are more than 50,000 inmates doing time at 54 prisons around the state for a range of crimes, from petty theft to multiple murders. Many interviewed by The Times, like Ibrahim Gyang, who is serving 25 years to life for killing a gang rival, were confined at maximum-security prisons. He acknowledged that inmates needed guards to keep order and protect them from being preyed on by the most violent among them.\u201cI just want the system to follow the rules,\u201d he said.Presented with The Times\u2019s findings, officials from the State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision said that while there were racial issues in any large organization, these had little impact on the disciplinary system in the prisons.\u201cWith an agency of close to 30,000 staff, the vast majority of our work force understand that it is a challenging job, and they approach it professionally,\u201d Tom Mailey, the department spokesman, said in a statement.The agency said that some racial disparities, like why black inmates spent more time in solitary confinement than whites, could be explained by data The Times did not have access to \u2014 most important, prisoners\u2019 full disciplinary histories.But the department provided no data to contradict The Times\u2019s findings of a systemwide imbalance in discipline.In July, Chavelo Borden, who is serving a six-year sentence for robbery, met with reporters in the visiting room at Clinton, where guards had hung a sign saying \u201cAll Lives Matter.\u201d Mr. Borden said he and other black prisoners at Clinton were treated \u201clike we\u2019re another species.\u201d\u201cThey don\u2019t see us with pristine eyes,\u201d he said.So many of the racial problems in the New York\u2019s prisons stem from a fundamental upstate-downstate culture clash that plays out daily on the cellblocks.The largely white work force comes from places in northern, western and central New York like Elmira, Malone, Rome and Utica. These are some of the state\u2019s poorer and less diverse communities, where, even as far north as the Canadian border, a Confederate flag can be spotted on the back of a pickup truck or hanging from a front porch. Inmates refer to some of the big maximum-security facilities as \u201cfamily prisons,\u201d where members of the same family have worked for generations. In these communities, prisons are often seen as political spoils, fiercely protected by upstate politicians for the jobs they provide.With the disappearance of manufacturing upstate, prisons provide many of the middle-class jobs factories once did. They are fueled by a steady supply of inmates, mostly black or Latino, who are shipped north, far from the urban areas where they grew up. More than half of the state\u2019s inmates are from New York City or its suburbs.Blacks and whites are treated more equitably in some of the prisons close to the city, including Sing Sing Correctional Facility in Ossining, less than an hour by train from Grand Central Terminal.Black officers make up the majority of the uniformed staff there, setting it apart from every other men\u2019s prison in the state. There were no disciplinary disparities between whites and blacks at Sing Sing, according to a Times review of the 1,286 violations issued to inmates there for breaking prison rules.Inmates interviewed at prisons around the state said that if they had to do time in a maximum-security facility, Sing Sing would be the best place.\u201cEveryone wants to get to Sing Sing,\u201d said Justin Shaw, an inmate who was doing time for criminal possession of a weapon.Mr. Gyang said, \u201cIt\u2019s coveted.\u201dOn the cellblocks, it is a foregone conclusion that the disciplinary system is rigged.The uniformed staff is given almost total control over the process. Corrections officers make the charges \u2014 issuing \u201ctickets,\u201d in prison parlance \u2014 and hearing officers, typically sergeants, lieutenants or captains, determine guilt and decide punishment. Inmates almost always lose. At disciplinary hearings, inmates won only about 4 percent of the cases in 2015, according to the department.The Times analyzed 59,354 disciplinary cases from last year. Systemwide, black inmates were 30 percent more likely to get a disciplinary ticket than white inmates. And they were 65 percent more likely to be sent to solitary confinement, where they are held in a cell 23 hours a day.Last year, black inmates got 1,144 tickets that resulted in 180 or more days in isolation; white inmates received 226 tickets that had similarly long sentences.Department officials said there were marked improvements in the past few years, thanks to a settlement the state had signed with the New York Civil Liberties Union that brought in a federal expert to oversee efforts aimed at reducing the use of solitary confinement. Between April 2014 and October of this year, the share of solitary prisoners who were African-American had decreased to 57 percent, from 64 percent, said Mr. Mailey, the department spokesman.\u201cIt will be a major undertaking to unwind decades-long practices and transform the culture of this large organization all the way down to the staff working in the cellblocks,\u201d Mr. Pendergrass said.There has been resistance from the rank and file. In a statement, the New York State Correctional Officers & Police Benevolent Association, the union that represents guards, said the settlement with the civil liberties union had made the prisons more dangerous.\u201cThe disciplinary system has been weakened in our prisons,\u201d the association said. \u201cEspecially given the heavy gang presence and overwhelming increases in violent incidents, appropriate disciplinary measures are needed to maintain order and to protect other inmates, as well as staff.\u201dSolitary confinement is only one piece of the disciplinary process that had a disparity, The Times found, and it is unclear whether the settlement will affect other elements of the system.Some of the starkest evidence of bias involves infractions that are vaguely defined and give officers the greatest discretion. Disobeying a direct order by an officer can be as minor as moving too slowly when a guard yells, \u201cGet out of the shower.\u201d It is one of the most subjective prison offenses. For every 100 black prisoners, guards issued 56 violations for disobeying orders, compared with 32 for every 100 whites, according to the analysis.For smoking and drug offenses, which require physical evidence, white inmates, who make up about a quarter of the prison population, were issued about a third of the tickets.Inmates have the right to appeal to an outside court and be represented by a lawyer \u2014 if they can find one willing to take their case; they almost never do. Of the tens of thousands of inmates who got disciplinary tickets in 2014 and 2015, about 280 were represented by Prisoners\u2019 Legal Services of New York, which is financed by the state. If an inmate is lucky enough to have Prisoners\u2019 Legal Services take his case, his odds improve greatly. About two-thirds of the organization\u2019s clients won their appeals \u2014 but by then, many had completed their solitary sentence.Ibrahim Gyang said in an interview that at one of his disciplinary hearings, an officer called as a witness had to reread the ticket because he could not remember the case. And Mr. Gyang still lost.The murderers, Richard W. Matt and David Sweat, both white, got the tools they needed to cut through walls and piping because of friendships they had developed with an officer and a civilian employee, both white. \u201cA major reason for allowing those inmates to have the latitude that they had was because they had white privilege,\u201d said Joseph Williams, who worked for the corrections department for 47 years and was one of its few black prison superintendents. \u201cWe know if he had been black he would have never been given that wide a latitude.\u201dMarkus Barber, a black inmate at Green Haven Correctional Facility, called it \u201cthe complexion for the connection.\u201dOn Oct. 23, 2014, at Clinton, John Richard was stopped by Officer Brian Poupore, who took issue with his tinted glasses even though he has vision problems and had a medical permit to wear them, according to department records.\u201cMonkeys don\u2019t wear glasses,\u201d a sergeant said, according to Mr. Richard, who is serving a life sentence for murder.When Mr. Richard refused to remove them, he said, Officer Poupore and several other guards jumped him. In their internal reports, the officers said Mr. Richard punched them several times and had to be subdued. After the encounter, Officer Poupore had a minor injury, according to the medical report, while the other officers had none.The medical report said Mr. Richard had bruises all over his body, including his face, under his ear and on his back. He had trouble walking, the report said. His glasses were broken.He was found guilty of assault and spent the next six months in solitary confinement.Assault on prison workers may seem like a straightforward infraction, but a closer look reveals a disturbing pattern. There were 1,028 such violations issued in the state system last year. Black men received 61 percent of them, while white men received 9 percent. Under department rules, officers have considerable leeway over what constitutes an assault. An inmate need not cause an injury or even touch an officer.About 20,000 uniformed officers work in the state\u2019s prisons. During the first half of the year, 2,007 of them were involved in assault cases, according to department data, but 98 percent of them had no injuries or only minor ones, which can be as vague as \u201caches/pain.\u201d Eight officers suffered serious injuries, defined as a broken bone or a puncture wound.The Times reviewed 215 reports of assaults on staff from the first quarter of 2015, obtained through a Freedom of Information Law request. The department redacted the officers\u2019 names but not the inmates\u2019. It also redacted most information about injuries, but in several cases, The Times was able to obtain medical records through the prisoners.Among those reports, the cases of three black inmates \u2014 Darius Horton, Paul Sellers and Justin Shaw \u2014 followed the same pattern: All were involved in seemingly trivial disagreements with guards that led to minor altercations. And while it is hard to know who was responsible for escalating the episodes, the officers were not injured and remained on duty, while the inmates were punished with long stints in isolation.Mr. Sellers was returning from dinner at Five Points Correctional Facility when he was stopped by an officer for taking \u201ca loaf of state bread\u201d back to his cell, according to the guard\u2019s report. \u201cSurrender the bread,\u201d the officer ordered. Mr. Sellers refused and grabbed the shirt of the officer, who punched him in the face. He was sent to solitary for 166 days.Mr. Shaw was stopped at Washington Correctional Facility because he was \u201cattempting to conceal contraband,\u201d according to the officer\u2019s report. When challenged, \u201cthe inmate produced a stack of waffles,\u201d the report said. Mr. Shaw was accused of then grabbing the officer\u2019s arm and given a 180-day lockup.Mr. Horton was caught by Officer Michael Stamp at Groveland carrying a bowl of hot water from the microwave for coffee after the common room had closed. The officer ordered Mr. Horton to leave it, he refused and they got into a shouting match and bumped shoulders, according to the report. The guard claimed that Mr. Horton then punched him. In an interview, Mr. Horton denied this, saying he was jumped by Officer Stamp and six other guards. Two of the officers had minor injuries; the other five were unharmed. Mr. Horton was sentenced to 270 days in isolation.How much race figured in these three encounters \u2014 if it did at all \u2014 is hard to know. The guard in Mr. Sellers\u2019s case was Hispanic; in the other two cases, the guards were white. Mr. Shaw said the officer might have just been having a bad day. \u201cI don\u2019t like to say everything is race,\u201d he said.For Mr. Horton, there was no doubt that race was at play when, as he told it, he was handcuffed and beaten by seven officers, all of them white.\u201cThey took me out there and beat me like I got caught drinking at the whites-only fountain,\u201d he said.The corrections officers\u2019 union encourages members to report even the slightest physical contact as an assault. As the union negotiates a new contract, billboards in the Albany area have shown officers with neck braces, strapped to stretchers. Assaults on staff members have increased in recent years. There were 895 cases recorded in 2015, some involving more than one inmate, compared with 577 in 2010, according to department data. More recently, assaults on staff were down by 16 percent between January and October of this year, compared with the same period last year, the department said.Union officials did not comment on the racial disparities in discipline that The Times found.\u201cWhile facing record high levels of violence and one of the most dangerous work environments in the country, corrections officers conduct themselves with professionalism and integrity to keep our prisons secure and our communities safe,\u201d the union said in a statement.Inmates claim that officers regularly provoke altercations that are classified as assaults, including taunting them with racial slurs or touching them inappropriately during a pat frisk. The Times\u2019s analysis showed that prisoners charged with failing to comply with a pat-frisk order were also often charged with assault. Over all, black men were punished seven times as often for pat-frisk infractions as white men, and among inmates under 25, blacks received 185 tickets, while whites got only 14.One of the more humiliating abuses inmates describe is known as the \u201ccredit card swipe.\u201d Officers order the prisoners to stand against a wall for a pat frisk and then swipe their hands aggressively between their buttocks.If an inmate is startled and pulls a hand off the wall, the officer has a green light to use force.When a corrections sergeant stopped Rashief Bullock on his way back from breakfast at Attica Correctional Facility in January 2015, it was not for breaking a prison rule. It was because he was acting \u201cerratic\u201d and \u201cfidgety,\u201d the sergeant\u2019s report said.That should have been no surprise. Mr. Bullock, who is serving an eight-year sentence for selling drugs to an undercover police officer, describes himself as \u201cmentally unstable.\u201d Many of his letters home to his father are confused and delusional. In one he wrote, \u201cI haven\u2019t been talking like how I use to because I\u2019ve been hearing voices to much.\u201d In another he asked, \u201cWhy do these middle Eastern prostitutes Harass me everyday?\u201dThe sergeant wrote in his report that he conducted a pat frisk and found nothing but then, as they were heading back to his cell, Mr. Bullock suddenly punched him in the face with his left fist. Mr. Bullock, who is right-handed, denies hitting anyone.Wherever the truth lies, the incident report makes it clear that no one was hurt and that all six officers involved remained on duty.Even so, Mr. Bullock was found guilty of assaulting an officer and spent six months in solitary confinement. Inmates with mental illness are often the least equipped to handle the stresses of a regimented prison life. They tend to act out more and are disciplined at far higher rates.Race magnifies their problems. Of the 100 inmates statewide who were sentenced to the most time in solitary last year, more than half were minorities who at some point had been treated in prison mental health programs, according to the Times analysis.Mr. Bullock, 32, has spent long stretches in isolation at six different prisons. \u201cI get thrown in the S.H.U. every jail I go to because I can\u2019t control my body,\u201d he said, referring to solitary-confinement cells.He is what fellow inmates call a \u201cherb,\u201d an easy mark for guards to pick on. Corrections officers \u201creally don\u2019t like me, I think,\u201d he said.It was the same on the outside. On the evening of Jan. 8, 2009, as plainclothes officers moved in to arrest Mr. Bullock on a Staten Island street corner, his friends drove off without him, according to the police report.For much of the past summer, Mr. Bullock was confined to his cell for 23 hours a day after getting a ticket for \u201cbeing out of place.\u201d Given how psychotic he seemed during two recent interviews in the visiting room at Elmira, it is remarkable that he could follow any of the 120 regulations for which an inmate can be disciplined.He described a \u201cdimension portal\u201d in Sudan that was a secret entrance to hell; explained that he was from \u201cdivine lineage\u201d; and said he communicated with people in their graves, including his relative Alexander the Great.At the time, he said he was not receiving mental health treatment or taking medication.Mr. Bullock was not sure whether racism had been a factor in his case at Attica \u2014 where 96 percent of the officers are white, and only 1 percent black \u2014 although he said he had seen it a lot in prison. At Greene Correctional Facility, he said, an officer mocked him for \u201csweating like a black man at a math contest\u201d; at Coxsackie Correctional Facility, a guard threatened to \u201cbeat the black\u201d off him.During the seven years in prison, he has written scores of letters to his father, Rudy Bullock. Early on, his letters were rational, focused and touching. In May 2012, he asked his father to send him a scientific calculator. Around the same time, he wrote: \u201cDear Pops, I wish I was home and we were going to the movies or a restaurant. I hate jail a lot. So many colored folks in jail, if I was rich I know I could of beat this case.\u201dBut in July of that year he wrote: \u201cI\u2019M GOING THROUGH TO MUCH DEPRESSION. I CAN\u2019T HANDLE THIS MUCH LONGER!\u201d And that November: \u201cMy mental health is going horrible in here and it\u2019s detiriating fast from being isolated in my room all day.\u201d\u201cBeing in the box,\u201d he wrote in September 2014, \u201cI have been undergoing unsurmountable stress.\u201dMr. Bullock is currently doing a 90-day solitary sentence at Five Points for disobeying a direct order. He is scheduled to leave isolation on Christmas.No other prison in the state is like Sing Sing. Of the 686 uniformed staff members there, 83 percent are black or Latino, compared with 17 percent for the entire state prison system.Reggie Edwards, who is serving 25 years to life for murder, said Sing Sing\u2019s guards were often from the same neighborhoods as the inmates. Mr. Edwards said the white guards knew city life and were more likely to have black or Hispanic friends.\u201cThey identify with us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey see things from our perspective.\u201dElizabeth Gaynes, the executive director of the Osborne Association, an inmate advocacy group, said guards at Sing Sing \u201csee the men as less \u2018foreign.\u2019\u201dThe disciplinary disparities in most of the other prisons do not exist at Sing Sing. Black inmates make up 57 percent of the population there and get 58 percent of the tickets.Guards write fewer disciplinary tickets there than they do at most other maximum-security prisons. In 2015, there were 27 tickets given for assault on staff at Sing Sing, compared with 91 at Great Meadow Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison of similar size in Comstock.\u201cIt relieves so much stress being in one of those jails down there with all those black people,\u201d Mr. Bullock wrote in one of his letters to his father. Being that close to home, he wrote, he could pick up Hot 97, the New York City hip-hop radio station, in his cell.Because Sing Sing is so close to the city, with major nonprofits like the Fortune Society and the Osborne Association nearby, it has more programs than most state prisons. Inmates can get a college degree and participate in theater and art initiatives.Sing Sing also receives more family visits annually than any other prison in the state, the department said.For these reasons, Sing Sing is used by the corrections department as a reward for inmates with good records at other prisons.At a graduation ceremony in mid-October, 68 men received certificates for completing a four-month parenting and relationships course as wives, girlfriends, parents and children rose for one standing ovation after another.One woman in the audience, Joyce Newell, a nurse\u2019s aide, said that when her son was at Clinton, 300 miles north of the city, she would have to catch a bus from the Bronx at 11:30 on Friday nights to be there in time for visiting hours on Saturday morning. She would arrive back in the Bronx at 2 a.m. on Sunday and then take a subway to her apartment. Now that her son is at Sing Sing, the trip takes her half an hour. \u201cI visit him every week on my day off,\u201d she said.Sing Sing can still be brutal. One assault case examined by The Times involved an inmate named James Wright, who was released last year after completing a five-year robbery sentence. Mr. Wright argued with a guard, was pushed against a wall and subdued by four other officers, according to the incident report. The guards had no injuries; Mr. Wright\u2019s two front teeth were knocked out.And still, when asked if the prisons farther upstate were worse for black inmates, Mr. Wright answered, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201dThere is evidence that the inequitable treatment of blacks in state prisons has been going on for decades. In 1993, in response to a lawsuit filed by the Prisoners\u2019 Rights Project of the Legal Aid Society, a federal judge ordered the state to correct disparities at Elmira. Based on a detailed statistical analysis, the judge, David G. Larimer, concluded that black inmates were assigned the worst prison jobs, housed on the most decrepit cellblocks and disciplined out of proportion to their numbers.In a ruling meant to correct these imbalances, Judge Larimer mandated quotas to ensure that black prisoners would get a fair share of the good jobs and housing on preferred cellblocks. Those quotas remain in place. To this day, the Prisoners\u2019 Rights Project receives regular reports from the corrections department listing the number of Elmira inmates by race for the most desired jobs and housing blocks.At the time, Legal Aid also asked that discipline be monitored for racial disparities, but the state resisted.John Boston, the lead lawyer for the prisoners, warned in court that without such monitoring, black inmates would continue to be singled out disproportionately for punishment. \u201cOnce everybody\u2019s head is turned and we all move on to something else, the problem is likely to reassert itself,\u201d he said at the time.That is exactly what happened. After more than two decades, disparities in housing and jobs at Elmira have largely disappeared. But as The Times\u2019s analysis showed, discipline in Elmira is still as racially skewed now as it was in the 1980s, with black inmates punished at about twice the rate of whites.It is not just black inmates who suffer harassment at the hands of white guards.In the early 2000s, a group of white officers and supervisors relentlessly taunted and abused Curtis Brown, one of the few black guards at Elmira. According to documents from an investigation by the corrections department\u2019s affirmative-action office, the white officers wrote \u201cToken\u201d on his locker, and someone attached a picture of a disheveled black man to his timecard and wrote, \u201cThis is your black ass nigger brother.\u201dWhile Officer Brown was serving in the honor guard at a funeral for a fellow officer, a corrections lieutenant, George Martin, came up to him and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know they let niggers in here,\u201d investigators reported. And at a local hockey game that Officer Brown was attending with his family, Officer Nicolo Marino said to another white guard who was present, \u201cI see you brought your inmate porter with you,\u201d according to a state investigation.In a federal lawsuit filed by Officer Brown, he said that another guard once came up behind him and wrapped a chain around his neck as if it were a lynching. The suit was settled in 2009 for an undisclosed amount.A white guard who stood up for Officer Brown was also targeted. The guard, Quentin Halm, reported in an affidavit that because they were friends, he was singled out by \u201cbigots and racists.\u201dOne guard said to Officer Halm that if he loved Officer Brown so much, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you kiss him on his big, fat lips?\u201d Another suggested that he go to \u201ccornrow school with your homey.\u201dRecords from the state comptroller indicate that none of the white guards involved were suspended, and that several of them continued to work at Elmira for years after the state affirmative-action investigation. Whether they received some other form of punishment is not known, since state law prohibits the public release of officers\u2019 disciplinary records.Officer Brown, now in his 28th year on the job, is one of eight black guards at Elmira.Through the years, the corrections department has made attempts to integrate the work force at some of the big upstate prisons. In the 1970s and \u201980s, black officers from the Buffalo area were transferred to Attica. While the two communities are just 35 miles apart, Attica sits in the middle of farm fields, in the overwhelmingly white Wyoming County. The new black guards were mercilessly harassed, said Tyrrell Muhammad, who was imprisoned at Attica then and is now a project associate at the Correctional Association, an inmate advocacy group that has a state mandate to monitor conditions in the prisons. Mr. Muhammad said black officers were roughed up and humiliated in front of the other guards. Most left, he said.Even if the department wanted to transfer black officers into the upstate prisons, a seniority provision in the state\u2019s contract with the guards\u2019 union would make that impossible. It is the officers who decide where they work, not the prison superintendents or even the corrections commissioner. The state is negotiating a new contract, but union officials say that seniority rules are not negotiable.Federal intervention has been one of the few effective means of addressing the racial inequities and civil-rights violations in New York State prisons. It has worked at Elmira for housing and jobs and has been somewhat successful in holding officers accountable for the worst excesses of brutality and discrimination.Just as egregious was the cover-up, Mr. Bharara said: The officers hit one of their own on the back with a baton to make him appear injured, took several photos for the record and falsified reports claiming that Mr. Moore had attacked them, according to the indictment.\u201cExcessive use of force in prisons, we believe, has reached crisis proportions in New York State,\u201d Mr. Bharara said at the news conference.Like Attica and Clinton, Downstate is a particularly difficult prison for minority inmates, who, in 2015, were more than twice as likely to be disciplined as whites, The Times\u2019s analysis showed. Blacks and Latinos got 1,078 tickets, while whites received 144.Mr. Moore was so badly beaten that he spent 17 days in the hospital.What happened next is a prime example of why many inmates consider the prison disciplinary system to be a farce.Mr. Moore was issued a ticket for assault on staff and put in solitary confinement after being discharged from the hospital.It was only when an internal affairs investigator with the corrections department intervened that Mr. Moore was let out of isolation and the assault charge was dropped.By then, he said, he had spent 26 days in solitary confinement. After the officers were indicted, he was transferred out of state custody and moved to an undisclosed location to protect him from possible reprisals by corrections officers.Susan C.

{"Headline": "New York\u2019s New Subway Is a Century Overdue", "Date": "2016-12-30", "News": "Supported byEditorialHistoric, sure. On time? Let\u2019s talk about that.But we all know that the Second Avenue subway is nearly a century overdue. It was dreamed up in the 1920s, was derailed by the Great Depression, by wars overseas and political battles at home, by the 1970s fiscal crisis, by dithering, distractions, diverted funds and the inertia that keeps big infrastructure projects forever on the drawing board. Over time the Second Avenue line became a wistful, theoretical thing: like an empty cab on a rainy Friday, a parking space in the West Village, a train to Brigadoon.But hey, it is now time for real rejoicing on the East Side, where there will finally be an alternative to the Lexington Avenue line, whose rush-hour cars are stuffed with riders like vacuum packages of whole-bean coffee. If, as expected, 200,000 passengers a day start riding the new Q, that will bring blessed relief to the No. 4, 5 and 6 trains.The euphoria will be real for riders accustomed to the system\u2019s World War II technology, hypercrowding, chronic delays, breakdowns and filth. But that doesn\u2019t mean they shouldn\u2019t expect more: This new line is only a first phase, with just three stations, at 72nd, 86th and 96th Streets. Promises have been made to begin the second phase, to 125th Street in Harlem, but the financing and timing for that extension are unclear. And nobody knows when or whether the line will fulfill its destiny: to reach all the way to the bottom of Manhattan.As Mr. Cuomo takes his victory laps \u2014 up and down several stops \u2014 as he has every right to do, he would do well to try to seize on this success and build upon it. He can start thinking more ambitiously and creatively about revitalizing the rickety, increasingly unlovable subway system, and start working with New York City on integrating transit projects with planning for housing, traffic and other needs. He is a governor who has not previously made mass transit a priority, but the M.T.A. is his responsibility, and the Second Avenue subway is only part of a much larger picture.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Boost the Economy, Help Students First", "Date": "2016-12-21", "News": "Supported byOn CampusDonald J. Trump has made bold and provocative campaign promises on taxes, trade, immigration and infrastructure. These pledges are all in service of bolstering our economic future. While we hope these initiatives will help our economic prospects, there is one important measure missing from the debate. And it could have an even more immediate and direct impact on economic growth: student debt relief.Student debt now stands at $1.3 trillion. More than half of student borrowers are unable to repay their loans according to the original terms. In a well-intended but poorly executed effort to make college broadly accessible, the government has lent freely to students, with little attention to whether they can repay those loans. The result is millions of young people with debt they cannot afford.As a college president, I frequently hear from students who are anxious about their ability to repay their loans once they graduate. Many let student debt guide their career choices.The Department of Education has tried to provide relief through a complex web of alternative repayment plans, including those based on a borrower\u2019s income. However, these plans are limited to certain borrowers and involve a confusing array of options and bureaucratic \u201crecertification\u201d requirements, which cause a large portion of young people to lose eligibility each year. Student borrowers\u2019 balances can actually get larger as they try to pay off their obligations.Mr. Trump should scrap debt financing of higher education and make the transition to true income share arrangements. Borrowers would fulfill their obligations to taxpayers by paying a fixed percentage of their income over an extended period of years. Think of this change as a shift in the government\u2019s role from creditor to equity investor. When you lend to a business, it is obligated to pay you back with interest, but with a stock investment, your returns derive from the success of the company.Similarly, with a student loan, there is a fixed obligation to repay the loan amount with interest, but with income share, there is only a contractual obligation for the student to return to taxpayers a certain percentage of his or her future income. Higher earners will pay back more than lower earners (up to a limit), though all will have an affordable payment and all will have protection against life events \u2014 a health crisis, caring for an elderly parent \u2014 that reduce their income.Replacing the current, unwieldy programs with a single repayment plan based on income would provide immediate relief for millions of young people while guaranteeing a steady source of revenue to taxpayer coffers, particularly if payments were built into the tax withholding system. It would also provide economic stimulus, as lower payments on student debt would translate into higher consumer spending.We saw during the housing crisis how unaffordable mortgage payments weighed on our economy by reducing the amount of disposable income available to people for spending. Excessive student debt is putting the same kind of drag on our prosperity. A growing body of research has concluded that as young people cope with high monthly student debt payments, they forgo things like buying a car or a house. Many live paycheck to paycheck. Escalating defaults among student borrowers impair their credit scores, making it even more difficult to borrow for large purchases.An additional measure to ease the student debt load would be tax law changes to require colleges to spend at least 5 percent of their endowments, as is required of other nonprofits. That\u2019s what we do at Washington College. The law should also require that schools use a certain amount of this endowment spending for scholarships.We bemoan consolidation and \u201cbigness\u201d among banks and corporate America, yet the same thing has been happening in higher education, where 1 percent of four-year institutions hold more than half of all endowment wealth.Sheila C. Bair is the president of Washington College. She served as chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation from 2006 to 2011.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Campus Press vs. Colleges: Kentucky Suit Highlights Free-Speech Fight", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byThe confidential informant had an explosive tip for the University of Kentucky\u2019s campus newspaper: An associate professor of entomology had been accused of groping students, and the college, after an investigation, had permitted him to leave quietly.On the trail of a hot story, the paper, The Kentucky Kernel, requested files from the university. Officials turned over some documents, but they contained few details.Now The Kernel is being sued by the university in a continuing battle over whether records in the case should be disclosed. And it is just one of several disputes between universities and student newspapers, which are pushing administrations to become more transparent about sexual assault, a defining issue on campuses around the country.With cuts at traditional news organizations, student journalists see their role as increasingly important in shedding light on the subject and are becoming more dogged in ferreting out information about sexual assault cases, particularly when faculty or student perpetrators could simply find other jobs or transfer to another university. Some are demanding that the student body be given details when a college confirms wrongdoing, particularly of a violent nature, by students, faculty or staff members.Universities, though, often invoke privacy concerns in refusing to make details of inquiries public.\u201cThe critical question is whether we are able to continue protecting the confidentiality and privacy of victim-survivors who courageously come forward to report details of their victimization,\u201d wrote the University of Kentucky\u2019s president, Eli Capilouto, in a universitywide email.\u201cThe protection of victim-survivor privacy,\u201d the email continued, \u201crequires more than the redaction of names. It requires the redaction of any information that might reasonably lead to the identification of victim-survivors as well as the intimate details of the sexual assault.\u201d\u201cWe were very concerned that the student press at Brandeis was being targeted unfairly,\u201d said Ari Cohn, a lawyer with the nonprofit Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, which aided the students. \u201cThe public relations issues around sexual assault on campus are massive right now. There\u2019s definitely a desire by universities to be out in front of those issues and to show they\u2019re taking this seriously. In some cases, like this one, that causes an overreaction.\u201dHannah Alani, the investigations editor for The Indiana Daily Student, said the university\u2019s refusal to release its report \u2013 partly on grounds that it is part of Mr. Wang\u2019s personnel file \u2014 fits a pattern in which the university has repeatedly declined requests related to sexual assault, prompting it to seek legal advice.An Indiana spokeswoman, Margie Smith-Simmons, said the documents requested by the paper were not \u201cpublic records,\u201d and therefore could not be released.The Kernel, which is partly financed by the University of Kentucky, has won numerous journalism awards. The university itself is home to a First Amendment Center endowed by the venerable Scripps Howard broadcasting and newspaper chain.As the dispute continued, the records in the case were leaked to the newspaper, which published an article based on them.Even though the records have already been disclosed, the university sued the paper to prevent the attorney general\u2019s order from establishing what it called a dangerous legal precedent, arguing that such a ruling would open the floodgates for the release of additional documents protected by student privacy provisions.Jay Blanton, a university spokesman, defended the college\u2019s record on sexual assault cases over all, as well as its handling of the case involving the entomology professor, James Harwood. The professor, who did not respond to requests for comment, has denied the accusations. \u201cThe agreement with Dr. Harwood removed him from campus and prevented him from interacting with students immediately,\u201d Mr. Blanton said.Supporters of The Kernel say the university\u2019s position may pose a public threat by permitting sexual predators to remain anonymous. At a meeting of university trustees, David Hawpe, a trustee and former editor of The Courier-Journal of Louisville, questioned whether the university was in danger of making the same kind of mistakes as the Catholic Church, which covered up sexual abuse by priests and permitted them to move from one parish to another.Internal emails released by the university reveal that Dr. Harwood, who has an impressive record of teaching and published research, was interviewing for other jobs at the time of his resignation.The university argues that releasing information makes victims afraid to come forward, fearful that their cases will become public. The university has suggested a connection between The Kernel\u2019s reporting and a decline in reported campus sexual misconduct cases. Mr. Capilouto said the decline \u2014 to 38 reports this year compared with 59 in the same period last year \u2014 \u201cunderscores the chilling impact that news reports are having on the willingness of victim-survivors to come forward.\u201d And the professor\u2019s accusers, whose representative initially encouraged the newspaper to report on the case, are now supporting the university\u2019s position after a meeting with Mr. Capilouto.Under its agreement with Dr. Harwood, who resigned in February, the university promised not to disparage the professor or disclose the agreement\u2019s existence unless someone filed an open records request or obtained a court order. In an email to a university dean, Dr. Harwood said he had been assured that the accusations would \u201cremain confidential, not on the public record, and not listed against my name.\u201dAs part of its agreement, the university continued his $109,000 annual pay through August.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018I\u2019m Here to Help,\u2019 Trump Tells Tech Executives at Meeting", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "Supported byThe meeting between President-elect Donald J. Trump and the nation\u2019s tech elite was hyped as something out of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d: The new boss tells his minions to shape up. It turned out to be a charm offensive, a kind of \u201cDancing With the Silicon Valley Stars.\u201d\u201cThis is a truly amazing group of people,\u201d the president-elect said on Wednesday in a 25th-floor conference room at Trump Tower in Manhattan. The gathering included Jeff Bezos of Amazon; Elon Musk of Tesla; Timothy D. Cook of Apple; Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook; Larry Page and Eric Schmidt of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company; and Satya Nadella of Microsoft, among others. \u201cI\u2019m here to help you folks do well,\u201d Mr. Trump said.He kept going in that vein. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody like you in the world,\u201d he enthused. \u201cIn the world! There\u2019s nobody like the people in this room.\u201d Anything that the government \u201ccan do to help this go along,\u201d he made clear, \u201cwe\u2019re going to be there for you.\u201dAnd that was just in the first few minutes. The candidate who warned during the presidential campaign that Amazon was going to have antitrust problems, that Apple needed to build its iPhones in the United States instead of China, was nowhere to be seen.Even after the press was ushered out, the meeting continued its genial way. Among the topics discussed, according to several corporate executives and a transition official briefed on the meeting, who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, were vocational education and the need for more of it, the promise and peril of trade with China and immigration (Mr. Trump wants \u201csmart and talented people here\u201d). The president-elect also asked the executives to see if they could not apply data analysis technology to detect and help get rid of government waste.There are plans for quarterly meetings of a smaller group of tech executives, to be organized by Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, said one of the executives briefed on the meeting. They will focus mainly on immigration and education issues.\u201cI won\u2019t tell you the hundreds of calls we\u2019ve had asking to come to this meeting,\u201d Mr. Trump told his guests. Everyone laughed.To get to the 25th-floor conference room, the tech leaders entered the golden elevators of Trump Tower the same way anyone would \u2014 by punching a button. This gave the news media, cordoned off a few feet away, time to shout questions. None of the executives took the bait.Neither did they talk on the way out, although by that time the building was being closed for Trump Tower\u2019s holiday party. Safra Catz, the co-chief of Oracle who attended the meeting, gave a thumbs up.Mr. Bezos later issued a statement that said he found the meeting \u201cvery productive.\u201d\u201cI shared the view that the administration should make innovation one of its key pillars, which would create a huge number of jobs across the whole country, in all sectors, not just tech \u2014 agriculture, infrastructure, manufacturing \u2014 everywhere,\u201d he said.The technology world had been in turmoil as the meeting drew near. Some argued the chief executives should boycott the event to show their disdain for Mr. Trump\u2019s values. Others maintained they should go and forthrightly make their values clear. And still others thought they should attend and make their accommodations with the new reality.Complicating the debate was the fact that the most fervently anti-Trump elements in Silicon Valley seem to be the start-ups and venture capitalists, few of which were invited to the meeting. (Alex Karp, the chief executive of Palantir Technologies, was the only head of a privately held tech company at the meeting.)Some tech companies were also notable for their absence. Twitter, the president-elect\u2019s medium of choice for communication, was not invited.In the days and hours before the meeting, various factions made their positions clear.A group of engineers and other tech workers issued a statement asserting that they would refuse to participate in the creation of databases that could be used by the government to target people based on their race, religion or national origin.Another group of entrepreneurs assembled virtually this week with the same goal of preventing any erosion of civil liberties.Mr. Levie, of Box, was a Hillary Clinton supporter but believes in engagement with the new administration.\u201cWe have to face reality that this is the next four years, and the best way to make sure our values are upheld is actually push on them,\u201d he said.More than values and policy are at stake in the relationship between the administration and the Valley. Money is, too.In the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, Forrester Research is cutting back its growth estimate for the United States tech market in 2017 to 4.3 percent from 5.1 percent.One reason is simple caution, as large multinational manufacturers navigate a new and unpredictable administration.Another reason: less tech spending by the government. \u201cThere are so many cabinet secretaries who are explicitly hostile to the mission of their agencies,\u201d said Andrew Bartels, a Forrester principal analyst.As for 2018, there are so many ways things could go that a forecast is impossible. \u201cIt\u2019s up for grabs,\u201d the analyst said.So, too, is the relationship of Mr. Trump and the tech industry. For the moment, though, Silicon Valley seems to have dodged a bullet.Julie Hirschfeld Davis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Charity Auction for Coffee With Ivanka Trump Appears to Be Canceled", "Date": "2016-12-16", "News": "Supported byTransition BriefingIn other transition news:\u25a0 A high-priced auction for coffee with the future first daughter Ivanka Trump appears to have been canceled, as criticism mounted that the Trumps were selling access.\u25a0 President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s son-in-law told business leaders in New York that Mr. Trump will be pushing a $1 trillion infrastructure plan closer to the ideal of Democrats than Republicans. At the same event, Senator Chuck Schumer, the incoming minority leader, sounded similarly conciliatory.\u25a0 Mr. Trump took to Twitter on Friday to again play down Russian interference in the elections \u2014 this time, seemingly praising one of the cyberattacks for the revelations it contained.The auction for a chance to spend up to 45 minutes with Ms. Trump over coffee at either Trump Tower in New York or the recently opened Trump International Hotel in Washington was to continue for another three days. As of Friday morning, the high bid was $72,888.But then the auction disappeared from the Charitybuzz website that had been hosting it, along with details on all the bids that had been offered since it opened on Dec. 5.\u201cThe loser is St. Jude, and the winner I\u2019m not exactly sure,\u201d one of the bidders, the Tex-Mex restaurateur Russell Ybarra, wrote in an email, referring to the Tennessee children\u2019s hospital, which stood to reap the proceeds.The Obama family has not directly participated in any fund-raising solicitation efforts since President Obama took office to avoid the impression that donations would allow the donor to get special access, said Norm Eisen, a former White House ethics lawyer.The president-elect\u2019s son-in-law and close adviser, Jared Kushner, told New York business leaders on Friday that Mr. Trump\u2019s vision for a large-scale federal infrastructure program was \u201ccloser\u201d to Senator Chuck Schumer\u2019s, the incoming minority leader, than to the majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell\u2019s.Mr. Kushner made the remarks at an event hosted by the Partnership for New York City, just after an appearance by Mr. Schumer, the New York senator.This week at a news conference in Washington, Mr. McConnell said he was not interested in \u201ctrillion-dollar stimulus\u201d to finance any infrastructure plan, setting up what could be the first of many clashes with a Trump White House that will not always hew to Republican orthodoxy.This does not excite Mr. McConnell who, like most Republicans, recalls President Obama\u2019s early stimulus plan unfavorably. That plan came in the middle of the worst recession since the Depression.\u201cWe need to do this carefully and correctly, and the issue of how to pay for it needs to be dealt with responsibly,\u201d Mr. McConnell, the Kentucky senator, said this week.Senate watchers used to the obstructionist stance that the Republican leader, Mr. McConnell, took with President Obama for eight years have been waiting for signs of the kind of minority leader that Mr. Schumer will be when he takes over as Democratic leader.The Democratic senator sent a big flashing of conciliation on Friday.Mr. Schumer praised Mr. Trump\u2019s call with the president of Taiwan, which drew objections from both sides of the aisle, as a shrewd move that sent a signal to China of a change in direction.Mr. Schumer made the remarks at the same annual meeting of the Partnership for New York City that Mr. Kushner spoke at, according to two people in attendance.Those attendees interpreted the comments as aligning Mr. Schumer with Mr. Trump on a diplomatic issue that has been met with consternation by the Obama White House.Mr. Schumer described the call that Mr. Trump took roughly two weeks ago as shrewd, and not necessarily indicating that it was a reflection of his view of the \u201cOne China\u201d policy, the two attendees said.An aide to Mr. Schumer did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.Mr. Schumer has been a critic of China as a currency manipulator over the years. At the breakfast, where he was followed by Mr. Kushner, Mr. Schumer suggested that Democrats lost in part because the election was about a change in course, and Hillary Clinton ran as a continuation of the Obama administration\u2019s direction.The president-elect took to Twitter on Friday to again dismiss the significance of Russia\u2019s meddling in the election \u2014 but with a new twist. This time, he seemed to praise the revelations of one of the cyberattacks.Ms. Brazile\u2019s subject line: \u201cOne of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is from a woman with a rash.\u201d\u201cHer family has lead poison and she will ask what, if anything, will Hillary do as president to help the ppl of Flint,\u201d Ms. Brazile wrote to John D. Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman, and Jennifer Palmieri, the candidate\u2019s communications director.That might seem like a pretty obvious question, given that the debate was in Flint to address the crisis over the city\u2019s lead-contaminated water. But it cost Ms. Brazile her commentator\u2019s job at CNN, and it helped to fuel Mr. Trump\u2019s accusation during the campaign that the election was \u201crigged\u201d in Hillary Clinton\u2019s favor.With the inauguration about a month away, a solid majority \u2014 62 percent \u2014 say the president-elect will bring real change to the way Washington works. Whether that is a good thing or a bad thing probably depends on your party. Some 58 percent say they believe he will divide rather than unite people.The announcement on Thursday that David M. Friedman, Mr. Trump\u2019s bankruptcy lawyer, would be nominated to be the United States ambassador to Israel, is likely to roil an American Jewish community that sided overwhelmingly with Hillary Clinton and is already at sea in the wake of the 2016 election.\u201cAre J Street supporters really as bad as kapos? The answer, actually, is no. They are far worse than kapos \u2014 Jews who turned in their fellow Jews in the Nazi death camps,\u201d Mr. Friedman said.J Street reacted almost immediately to news of Mr. Friedman\u2019s nomination, calling on the Senate to reject him.\u201cAs someone who has been a leading American friend of the settlement movement, who lacks any diplomatic or policy credentials and who has attacked liberal Jews who support two states as \u2018worse than kapos\u2019, Friedman should be beyond the pale for senators considering who should represent the United States in Israel,\u201d the group said in a statement.The Republican Jewish Coalition was all praise:\u201cThe selection of Mr. David Friedman to serve as United States ambassador to Israel sends a powerful signal to the Jewish community and the State of Israel that President-elect Trump\u2019s administration will strengthen the bond between our two countries and advance the cause of peace within the region.\u201cWe look forward to working with David and the entire Trump administration to cripple Iran\u2019s ability to develop nuclear weapons through new and strengthened sanctions, move the U.S. Embassy to the eternal capital of Israel, Jerusalem, and repair relations with our greatest ally in the Middle East that have eroded over the last eight years.\u201dA Trump economic adviser, Stephen Moore, caused quite a kerfuffle in Detroit on Thursday when in a fit of excitement, he announced that the economic commentator Larry Kudlow would be named chairman of Mr. Trump\u2019s White House Council of Economic Advisers.Mr. Kudlow, while certainly versed in economics, is not an economist. He has an undergraduate degree in history. The council chairman has traditionally been pulled from the highest echelons of academia to advise the president, not to lobby or persuade.Moreover, Mr. Kudlow is an ardent free trader and was openly critical of Mr. Trump\u2019s position on trade during the campaign, even as he enthusiastically backed the candidate.After the Democrats sent out their reactions, and the news media came alive, Mr. Moore sheepishly admitted that, while he is pulling for his friend Mr. Kudlow, the deal is not done.\u201cLarry is the obvious choice, because he has all the connections with the key players on Capitol Hill, and there\u2019s nobody that can articulate the free-market, conservative economic message better than Larry can,\u201d he said. But he admitted he had jumped the gun.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Consumer Agency Sues for Files on Home Installment Contracts", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byA powerful federal consumer agency that could be muzzled under President-elect Donald J. Trump is showing no inclination of backing down yet.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau filed a lawsuit on Tuesday in federal court in Michigan to require an investment firm that is a major player in the market for high-interest installment contracts for buying homes \u2014 called contracts for deed \u2014 to comply with an earlier demand for documents.The agency, which some Republicans in Congress have talked about reining in since Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, filed the suit after the investment firm, Harbour Portfolio Advisors of Dallas, refused a request for documents as part of a civil investigation.Harbour Portfolio bought more than 6,700 single-family homes after the financial crisis of 2008, most of them from Fannie Mae, a government-controlled mortgage finance firm, in bulk sales. Harbour paid $10,000 or less for most of the homes, which were foreclosed on during the financial crisis, and has sold them \u201cas is\u201d to consumers through long-term, high-interest installment contracts.The consumer bureau, according to the lawsuit, is trying to determine whether Harbour Portfolio\u2019s business practices violated the Truth in Lending Act and other federal laws the agency is empowered to enforce.The documents in the suit detail the timeline of the investigation, which began in May, a few months after the article appeared in The Times.In June, investigators from the bureau interviewed Charles A. Vose III, the founder of Harbour Portfolio, at an investigational hearing, according to the agency\u2019s suit. He testified about the contracts the firm uses and its practices and procedures.But since then, Mr. Vose and his lawyers have appeared to stymie the bureau.In September, Harbour Portfolio said it would not comply with a formal bureau request for documents because \u201cthe bureau lacked authority over its activities\u201d and argued the document request \u201cimposed an undue burden.\u201dAround that time, National Asset Advisors and a related firm, National Asset Mortgage, similarly notified the bureau that they, too, would not comply with the document request. Both are based in Columbia, S.C., and work closely with Harbour in collecting payments on contracts for deed and marketing its homes.The two firms also said some of the terms in the consumer bureau\u2019s document request were unclear. The bureau is seeking to require those firms to also turnover documents.On Nov. 1, Richard Cordray, the bureau\u2019s director, ordered Harbour, N.A.A. and N.A.M. to comply with a document request within 10 days. After it became clear that none would do so, the bureau went to federal court.A spokesman for the bureau declined to comment on the lawsuit.Lawyers for Harbour and N.A.A. declined to comment.The consumer bureau is proceeding with its investigation as it is dealing with fallout from an appellate court ruling in favor of PHH Corporation, a mortgage lender. That ruling found the bureau\u2019s leadership structure was unconstitutional because it gave too much authority to Mr. Cordray. The appellate court temporarily vacated a unilateral decision by Mr. Cordray to subsequently increase a fine imposed against PHH by $103 million.The agency is asking for the entire U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review the ruling from a three-judge panel.Advertisement"}

The tribe objects to the pipeline, which would run from North Dakota to Illinois, in part because it would desecrate ancestral lands, and its protest is a form of prayer. \u201cIt might seem cool to take a photograph of the chief in his headdress, but it\u2019s so freaking disrespectful,\u201d Mr. Rivas said. \u201cRespect the feathers, you know?\u201dMr. Rivas said, \u201cThe difference in having indigenous folks filming it is that Natives know what\u2019s appropriate and what\u2019s not.\u201dThe news media and video bloggers have a place at Standing Rock, Ms. Rae said, but in her view, many nonindigenous feature documentary makers are direct descendants of \u201cthe anthropologists\u201d \u2014 which Ms. Rae uses as a term of derision \u2014 who have long relegated Native American subjects to the equivalent of a \u201chuman zoo.\u201d\u201cWe look at it with different responsibilities,\u201d she said. \u201cOne guy on our team overheard a nonnative filmmaker say, \u2018This is really going to make my career.\u2019 This is different from speaking to one\u2019s descendants and generations to come.

I\u2019m white.

Its executive director, Shirley Sneve, said things didn\u2019t always work out the way you expect: \u201cThe Seventh Fire\u201d (2015), made by an outsider, she said, included very intimate portrayals of drug abuse by Native American people. \u201cI sometimes wonder if the director got them to open up to him more\u201d because of the subject matter, she said.Vision Maker has a mandate to tell Native American stories, she said, \u201cthough we fund people of all races based on the quality of their proposals. But we notice that Native American-led projects have a different sensibility.\u201d They tend to put subjects in historical context, she said, and understand nuances of custom and language, even if they\u2019re not fluent in the languages.But the differences, largely, seem to be about respect. \u201cA lot of these filmmakers are trust-fund kids from Silver Lake who want to wear their fur hats and do something fun,\u201d Caitlin Kazepis said, referring to the trendy Los Angeles neighborhood. She said she considered herself an outsider, although \u201cbeing from Alaska, I\u2019m embraced.\u201d She was researching films on oil pipelines when she found herself working for CNN at Standing Rock. When that project was over, she stayed.\u201cI have been welcomed and claimed by Natives as one of them, based on not what I am but who they have perceived me to be,\u201d Ms. Kazepis said, \u201cwhich is atypical and a huge honor. So the responsibility that I have to portray this culture is not something I take lightly.\u201dNot everyone sees it that way. Ms. Rae said: \u201cThere are only a couple of nonnative filmmakers who\u2019ve been there since the beginning.

{"Headline": "Former French Official Convicted of Tax Fraud", "Date": "2016-12-08", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 A former French official who led efforts to crack down on tax cheats was convicted on Thursday of tax fraud and money laundering.A three-judge panel at a Paris criminal court sentenced J\u00e9r\u00f4me Cahuzac, who had served as President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s budget minister for less than a year, to three years in prison.Mr. Cahuzac, 64, whom judges barred from holding a political office for five years, was convicted along with his former wife, Patricia Cahuzac, who was sentenced to two years in prison. The couple had paid \u20ac2.3 million or $2.5 million, in back taxes.Jean Veil, Mr. Cahuzac\u2019s lawyer, said that the ruling would be appealed, although the decision to carry on with the legal battle carried the risk of a sentence as long as seven years.\u201cWe think that prison isn\u2019t really an appropriate punishment,\u201d Mr. Veil told the French radio network Europe 1. \u201cHe\u2019s already punished. He\u2019s punished because he\u2019s a pariah. He\u2019s someone who can\u2019t live in town anymore.\u201dBut Georges Fenech, a member of a parliamentary commission that investigated Mr. Cahuzac, told the French news network BFMTV that the sentence was appropriate. \u201cThis proves that no one is above the law,\u201d Mr. Fenech said.Mr. Cahuzac previously acknowledged stashing money at banks in Singapore and Switzerland. During the trial, the prosecution was able to prove that about \u20ac2.7 million of the couple\u2019s \u20ac$3.5 million fortune had moved through a bank account held by Ms. Cahuzac in the Isle of Man, a bank account that was never reported to the French authorities.Judges at the court noted that Mr. Cahuzac had worked repeatedly to hide his assets, according to Agence France-Presse.Prosecutors said they suspected that the amount of wealth that was hidden was far higher but that the couple had spent it to support their lavish lifestyle.\u201cIt\u2019s a logical sentence, given the case,\u201d Xavier Normand-Bodard, the prosecution\u2019s lawyer, told reporters after the verdict was announced.The ruling came after a highly publicized two-week trial in September, at which Mr. Cahuzac \u2014 a former cosmetic surgeon who was known for his aggressive, confrontational style as a politician \u2014 was described by his lawyer as being in \u201cexile by force\u201d and as \u201cnot wanted in the public community anymore.\u201dFran\u00e7ois Reyl, the head of the Geneva bank that bears his surname, and Philippe Houman, a Frenchman who acted as an intermediary, were convicted on Thursday of assisting Mr. Cahuzac in transferring funds from an account in Switzerland to one in Singapore. The two were each given a suspended sentence of a year in prison and a \u20ac375,000 fine, and the Swiss bank was fined \u20ac1,875,000 for money laundering.In addition, the judges fined Ms. Cahuzac \u20ac100,000. Mr. Cahuzac, Mr. Reyl and Mr. Houman were instructed to pay the same amount among themselves.Mr. Cahuzac began sheltering some of the money the couple made from their successful hair transplant business in a UBS account in Switzerland in the 1990s, and those funds were later moved to Singapore.Mr. Cahuzac was first elected to Parliament in 1997. He retained the family\u2019s offshore accounts even after being appointed to lead a parliamentary finance commission in 2010.Once a rising star of the Socialist Party, Mr. Cahuzac, whose sharp-tongued speech and stern rigor were dreaded by his political opponents and lauded by his allies, suffered a humbling fall from grace that included an admission that he had repeatedly lied before Parliament and on television about holding such accounts.The confession, which stunned France, came after an investigation by Mediapart, an independent news website, asserted that Mr. Cahuzac had held an offshore account for roughly two decades.The most devastating blow came when Mediapart obtained an audio recording in which Mr. Cahuzac mentioned the account. \u201cI was caught in a spiral of lies,\u201d Mr. Cahuzac wrote on his blog at the time.As a result, laws were approved in 2013 to address conflicts of interest for those in public office. Top officials were obligated to make their property assets known publicly, and the law called for the creation of an independent anticorruption office and a national financial prosecutor\u2019s office, which handled Mr. Cahuzac\u2019s case.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Boeing Speaks in Trump Terms on Iran Deal: It\u2019s About Jobs", "Date": "2016-12-11", "News": "Supported by\u201cToday\u2019s agreement will support tens of thousands of U.S. jobs\u201d associated with the production and delivery of the planes, Boeing said in its news release.The intended recipient of Boeing\u2019s message clearly seemed to be President-elect Donald J. Trump.Its carefully worded statement is emblematic of the tightrope that America\u2019s biggest exporters are walking amid his threats to shake up trade policy and undo the Obama administration\u2019s nuclear accord with Iran. That agreement lifted the American sanctions on Iran, making Boeing\u2019s jet deal possible.Mr. Trump has talked about imposing tariffs on imports from China and on American companies that move jobs to Mexico and other countries. But he has not said much about how some of America\u2019s major manufacturing companies, like Boeing and General Electric, and their workers could be hurt if other countries retaliated for the tariffs or if existing trade agreements were ripped up.Boeing officials, already dismayed by Mr. Trump\u2019s attack last week over the costs of a new Air Force One, acknowledged that the Iran jet deal still faced contingencies \u2014 a polite way of saying they were deeply worried about whether Mr. Trump and the Republican-led Congress would support it.Beyond that deal, Boeing and other companies that export jet engines, high-tech products or heavy equipment \u2014 and supply some of the highest-paying manufacturing jobs \u2014 are also concerned that they could become easy targets if Mr. Trump started a trade war.\u201cYou slap a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports, and the Chinese suddenly acquire a fondness for Airbus jets instead of Boeing\u2019s,\u201d Richard L. Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst, said, referring to Boeing\u2019s European rival.Trying to protect some jobs could put others at risk, he said. \u201cAnd whether it\u2019s trade with Iran or China, there\u2019s an emerging pattern of the United States turning its economic back to the rest of the world, and that could be greatly damaging to the major export players like Boeing,\u201d he added.Boeing, based in Chicago, is the nation\u2019s top exporter in terms of the value of the goods it sells, which include midsize and giant airliners that are increasingly shipped to China and other parts of Asia, including the Middle East \u2014 areas with the fastest economic growth. Sales of its jets have long been a part of American diplomacy, with foreign buyers having to decide whether to deal with Boeing from America or Airbus from Europe. President Obama has said that he promotes Boeing\u2019s planes on his travels.Now, Boeing and other export-driven firms, while fearful of Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric, are hoping to make the case that they are exactly the types of companies that Mr. Trump should embrace.Boeing, which employs about 150,000 people, makes most of its parts in the United States and exports most of its products, bringing in cash from overseas. It has also increased production at its enormous plants in Washington State and South Carolina.But industry analysts say a 12-year boom in airliner sales seems to be peaking, and orders for larger planes are slowing. That means Boeing could use the government\u2019s help more than ever to keep pace with Airbus, its only major competitor.Several days before Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet, Boeing\u2019s chief executive, Dennis A. Muilenburg, had expressed concern in a speech over \u201capprehension about free and fair trade\u201d and \u201cnegative rhetoric\u201d about trade agreements by both Republicans and Democrats. The two men talked after Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet, and Mr. Trump later called Mr. Muilenburg \u201ca terrific guy\u201d with whom he could negotiate.Loren B. Thompson, an analyst at the Lexington Institute, a research group funded by Boeing and other military contractors, said Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet seemed intended \u201cto send a clear message to all these companies that they must not try to game the system while he\u2019s building up the military.\u201dBut the main concerns now for Boeing and most multinational companies are what will happen with Iran and China, and whether Washington, D.C., will be able to finance large export sales.Boeing said its agreement with Iran called for 80 planes to be delivered, starting in 2018. They include 50 of a new version of its single-aisle 737 jet, 15 of its larger 777s and 15 of a new 777X that should be ready for service by 2020.House Republicans have sought to block the sales, and Mr. Trump has said Iran would not have been able to negotiate with Boeing if it had not been for the \u201cdisastrous Iran nuclear deal,\u201d which put limits on Iran\u2019s nuclear programs. But in a tweet that gives Boeing hope, he also expressed concern last January that Iran might buy its jets from Airbus instead of Boeing.Iran said on Sunday that it was close to signing a deal to buy 118 planes from Airbus as the nation seeks to play the two companies against each other.Another big hurdle for Boeing would be how to finance its sales to Iran. Conservatives in Congress have been trying to kill the Export-Import Bank of the United States, which has long provided subsidized credit to promote American exports. Mr. Trump has said he does not think the bank is needed, but he added that he had not made a final decision.Mr. Aboulafia, the aviation analyst, said it would be hard for Iran to get private financing because lenders could have trouble repossessing the planes if it defaulted.Boeing and other big exporters are also concerned that Mr. Trump\u2019s tough stance toward China could set off a trade war, costing them sales and jobs if they get caught in the crossfire.In the recent speech, Mr. Muilenburg said one-fourth of Boeing\u2019s new planes were now bound for Chinese customers, and a significant amount of Boeing\u2019s future sales growth is expected to occur there.Still, Boeing has one of the largest corporate lobbying offices in Washington, as well as other ways to reach Mr. Trump before he makes crucial decisions.Mr. Trump has named a former Boeing chief executive, W. James McNerney Jr., to a 16-member group of strategic advisers. Mr. Muilenburg, the current chief executive, grew up in Iowa, whose Republican governor, Terry Branstad, was Mr. Trump\u2019s pick as ambassador to China.Mr. Branstad has been friends with China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, since Mr. Xi visited Iowa on an agriculture mission decades ago. Analysts say Mr. Branstad could help moderate some of the trade tensions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iran and Boeing Sign $16.6 Billion Deal on Sale of 80 Aircraft", "Date": "2016-12-11", "News": "Supported byTEHRAN \u2014 Iran and Boeing signed a deal for the sale of 80 airplanes on Sunday, five weeks before the inauguration of President-elect Donald J. Trump, whose Republican supporters in Congress have tried to block any aircraft sales to Iran.Iran\u2019s national airline, Iran Air, said that it had signed an agreement with Boeing, an American manufacturer, to purchase the aircraft, at a total cost of $16.6 billion.Boeing confirmed the deal, saying that the contract was reached within the terms of the government license that the department had issued.The sale includes 50 twin-jet, narrow-body 737 planes and 30 long-range, wide-body 777 aircraft. The first airplanes are scheduled for delivery in 2018, with the entire order being fulfilled over 10 years.In a statement, Boeing said the deal would support tens of thousands of American jobs directly associated with production and delivery of the airplanes, and nearly 100,000 jobs in the broader aerospace industry in the United States.The likelihood of the agreement being carried out, however, has decreased with the election of Mr. Trump.His Republican supporters in Congress introduced a bill that attempts to stop sales by Boeing to Iran, obliging the Treasury Department to refuse the licenses needed by American banks to finance such an agreement. The bill passed the House of Representatives in November, but President Obama has vowed to veto the legislation should it also gain Senate approval.Mr. Trump has had different stances on the sales of Boeing aircraft to Iran. In June, his campaign gave out a statement on the negotiations between Iran and Boeing, saying, \u201cThe world\u2019s largest state sponsor of terror would not have been allowed to enter into these negotiations with Boeing without Clinton\u2019s disastrous Iran nuclear deal.\u201d\u201cIran is going to buy 116 jetliners with a small part of the $150 billion we are giving them \u2026 but they won\u2019t buy from U.S., rather Airbus,\u201d he wrote.With American banks possibly being blocked from financing and maybe even transferring money involved in the deal, it is unclear how Iran would pay for the aircraft.

Back then, a global rush into dollars caused short-term borrowing rates to skyrocket, forcing hedge funds to shut down and banks to fail.Since the election, the cost of borrowing dollars short term in the yen, euro and Swiss franc has risen markedly.Paul Christopher, an investment strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors, said this will be a concern for Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman. \u201cIn the type of global economy we live in, she has to be careful about the dollar increasing too much, creating dollar shortages and liquidity problems as a result,\u201d he said.Fighting against gun violence has often been a lonely task for activists, who on their own were dwarfed by the size of the gun lobby.Together, big firms are committing tens of millions of dollars in free legal services from top corporate lawyers. Until now, there has not been a coordinated effort across law firms to lobby for stricter gun control.The coalition\u2019s legal strategies include:\u2022 Seeking to overturn state laws that have gone largely unchallenged, including new policies that force businesses to allow guns to be carried on their property\u2022 Mounting the first formal challenges to congressional restrictions on publishing government data on gun violenceBrad D.

{"Headline": "For This Choreographer, One Size Does Not Fit All", "Date": "2016-12-30", "News": "Supported by\u201cThis whole thing is based on imagination,\u201d Mr. Harrell said of his fictitious meeting between a Harlem voguer and the experimental Judson gang. Speaking by telephone from his hometown of Douglas, Ga., he said that in terms of structure he was initially inspired by Rem Koolhaas and Bruce Mau\u2019s book, \u201cS, M, L, XL,\u201d as well as by David Hammons\u2019s \u201cBliz-aard Ball Sale,\u201d in which the artist sold snowballs on the street in sizes from XS to XL.But that was just a starting point for Mr. Harrell, who added more sizes to his conceptual project, with dances that related Greek mythology to vogueing houses and explored notions of realness and authenticity. He said with a laugh, \u201cAt a certain point I was like, this has to end.\u201dIn addition to the basic five works, ranging from \u201cXS\u201d to \u201cXL,\u201d he choreographed spinoffs, including \u201cAntigone (Jr.)\u201d and \u201cJudson Church Is Ringing in Harlem (Made-to-Measure).\u201d He was also intrigued by the idea of the ordinary movement in both vogueing and postmodern dance. Vogueing places the pedestrian body on the runway, while Judson Dance Theater \u2014 an experimental collective that led to postmodern dance \u2014 embraced the neutral body and the idea that anyone could dance. It positioned itself against virtuosity, against glamour.And each of those forms, Mr. Harrell continued, was reacting to a similar idea: \u201cWhile the ethos behind postmodern dance was inclusivity \u2014 everyone could dance and dance was no longer about embracing the spectacle \u2014 vogueing was about realness,\u201d he said. \u201cWho could be a part of this new democracy, and what does democracy mean?\u201dIt goes against the norm, in other words. In the performing arts world, it is the custom that artists continually create and promote something new, something original. Lili Chopra, the executive vice president and artistic director of the French Institute Alliance Fran\u00e7aise, said, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to say, \u2018It\u2019s actually going to be the same experience.\u2019\u201dMs. Chopra said this development made her imagine \u2014 though not, she added, in a cynical way \u2014 that \u201chere we go with artists creating the first, the second and the third, whether it\u2019s Miguel, whether it\u2019s Trajal.\u201dAnd it helps with financing, Ms. Chopra said: Series of works can lead to multiyear grants or longer-term commitments between presenters and choreographers. \u201cBut I think once you let go of this notion of having to reinvent yourself,\u201d she said, \u201cor finding this new thing and actually continuing to crack that thing \u2014 the continuation of that same thread of idea \u2014 it is very radical.\u201dAnd what knocked her out about Mr. Harrell, she said, was witnessing the power of the series as a whole when it was presented at the Kitchen as part of the French Institute\u2019s Crossing the Line festival in 2014. \u201cTrajal owns the context that he\u2019s creating,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s almost imposing it onto the venue and the audience as opposed to us as a venue or as a festival creating a context for an artist.\u201dEarly on, Mr. Harrell also envisioned how the audience would increase as his pieces grew in size. Theaters, accordingly, became larger to accommodate more viewers; in the case of \u201cXL,\u201d because it\u2019s free and will be available digitally, there is no limit to who sees it. He also embraced the idea of touring works from the series at the same time.\u201cThe idea that someone would push a lot of stuff into the market at one time \u2014 three or four pieces \u2014 was kind of unheard-of,\u201d Mr. Harrell said. \u201cI just went for it. I was into the work, and I was following my guts and my need to make something. I knew that there was a possibility that theoretically it should be a game changer.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know if it would work, but he said, \u201cIt was a theory.\u201dHe looked at how marketing researchers approached ideas about visibility \u2014 that the more people who recognize you, the more people will come. But he stressed that audience development was never his only, or even primary, goal. \u201cYou just have to always do what\u2019s right for your work,\u201d he said.American Realness will feature Mr. Harrell performing \u201cS,\u201d the evening-length solo that began it all. In it, he demonstrates 20 different looks beginning with \u201cWest Coast Preppy Schoolboy.\u201d When he started working on \u201cS,\u201d it was in reaction to his 2008 piece, \u201cQuartet for the End of Time,\u201d which opened in New York just as the financial crisis hit. \u201cNo one came to see it,\u201d he said, \u201cand it didn\u2019t tour.\u201dSuch things no longer pose a problem for Mr. Harrell, who has not only continued to choreograph dances outside of the series, but will also show a survey of work this summer at the Barbican in London. Still, he remembers 2008 well and his credo remains the same.\u201cWhen you work as hard as people do in New York \u2014 to put up a show, you do it once, and it\u2019s over and you start again. It is a bit devastating. I would always have this post-performance depression that almost killed me and I thought, you know what? Don\u2019t stop. Just keep on going.

Human rights groups relay allegations of rape and the slaughter of children. Thousands of refugees have fled across the border to Bangladesh, while aid workers have been prevented from reaching the afflicted.Now, nearly two months after the campaign began, it remains unclear what Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s plan is. She has chosen not to visit the area, close to the border with Bangladesh, which has been sealed under a military directive designed to keep out foreign aid workers and journalists.And though she has created an advisory commission headed by Kofi Annan, the former United Nations secretary general, to look into long-term reconciliation in Rakhine State, she has largely defended the military\u2019s behavior.\u201cShow me a country without human rights issues,\u201d she said at an Oct. 12 news conference. \u201cEvery country has human rights abuses. I am taking seriously allegations of human rights violations in this country.\u201dA few weeks later during a visit to Tokyo, she said, \u201cWe have been very careful not to blame anyone until we have complete evidence about who has been responsible.\u201dThe Obama administration had hoped that once Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi came to power, the plight of the Rohingya would improve. Instead, their living conditions have deteriorated, American officials say. Near the town of Sittwe, south of where the military campaign is being carried out, more than 100,000 Rohingya live in internment camps, after their properties were demolished in communal violence in 2012.The army began its campaign this fall, after it said armed men killed nine police officers on Oct. 9. But instead of retaliating against what is believed to be a small group of poorly armed Rohingya men, it has uprooted tens of thousands of impoverished civilians, most of whom lead a hand-to-mouth existence as rice farmers and petty traders.Experts say the army\u2019s excessive methods are adapted from British counterinsurgency tactics from the colonial era, known as the \u201cfour cuts.\u201d The military has honed those practices during decades of fighting ethnic groups in other parts of Myanmar, said U Aung Thu Nyein, director of the Institute for Strategy and Policy in Myanmar.Those tactics include denying armed groups access to intelligence, finance, recruits and food by pushing civilian populations away from where they usually live. About 10,000 Rohingya have struggled across the border into Bangladesh since the operation began, many of them weak after evading Bangladeshi patrols that have officially closed the border, the United Nations high commissioner for refugees said.The ultimate goal was \u201cthe ethnic cleansing of the Muslim minority in Myanmar,\u201d Mr. McKissick said.As the civilian leader of the government, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi now shares power with the military. The army controls three vital cabinet posts: defense, home affairs and border affairs. These are the ministries running the anti-insurgency operation in Rakhine State.Most of the information she receives on the Rohingya is from military leaders, and they have convinced her that the Rohingya in Rakhine are terrorists, analysts in Myanmar say. Her government advisers are mostly former military officers, or veteran civil servants with firm beliefs about the superiority of Buddhist values over all others, they say.A spokesman for Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi said she was \u201cstanding\u201d with the military. \u201cShe knows everything,\u201d said U Zaw Htay, the spokesman. \u201cThe military has been briefing her on every important issue.\u201dFurther, there is little pushback against the military from the Myanmar news media or other possible quarters of criticism, said Kelley Currie, a senior fellow at the Project 2049 Institute, a private group that promotes international security in Washington, and who regularly visits Myanmar.\u201c\u2018Progressive\u2019 elements have either gone silent or joined in anti-Muslim and anti-ethnic rhetoric based on information that is sole-sourced to the military,\u201d she said.So far, the government has declined requests to appoint an independent inquiry into the military\u2019s abuses. Instead, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is depending on the advisory commission, which does not include any Rohingya members. Mr. Annan is scheduled to visit Sittwe on Friday.Mr. Giannini said there is enough evidence to warrant an independent commission similar to one conducted in the Darfur region of Sudan under the auspices of the United Nations in 2004. That inquiry found the Sudanese military had committed war crimes and referred the matter to the International Criminal Court.\u201cWe\u2019ve steadily received allegations of mass rape of Rohingya women and girls by army soldiers,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cWith a gun to his head, one man was reportedly forced to watch as soldiers raped his 14-year-old daughter.\u201dAbout 30,000 men, women and children are in \u201cdesperate need\u201d of food, shelter and medical care, said Vivian Tan, a spokeswoman for the United Nations high commissioner for refugees. About 160,000 vulnerable people have been cut off from health care, school feedings and maternal care, she said.Most of the aid workers who should be tending to the displaced have been forced to leave the area and have been refused travel permits to return, Mr. Smith said. The office of the state counselor, which Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi presides over, is in charge of travel permits for the Rakhine region.Of 26 workers distributing aid before Oct. 9, only six were still there, he said.Like many who admired Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s steadfastness during 15 years of house arrest under the former junta, Mr. Giannini, the Harvard Law professor, said he was baffled by her failure to speak out.\u201cShe says she is a politician,\u201d he noted. \u201cYou can have politics and you can have protection of the civilian population at the same time.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hunt for Berlin Suspect Ends in Gunfire on an Italian Plaza", "Date": "2016-12-23", "News": "Supported by\u201cPolice bastards,\u201d Mr. Amri, who turned 24 this week, shouted in Italian before dying, according to the account given by Antonio De Iesu, director of the Milan police, at a news conference.For Italy, the shooting death of Mr. Amri, a Tunisian who had pledged his allegiance to the Islamic State\u2019s supreme leader in a video released by the group on Friday, spurred a moment of national pride and some reassurance that its security measures were working.For Germany, it brought a sense of palpable relief after a week of national anguish. \u201cNow I can wish you all a really peaceful Christmas,\u201d the German interior minister, Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re, told reporters Friday afternoon, as he thanked his Italian counterparts.But the death also raised numerous questions about Mr. Amri\u2019s movements and motivations, as well as about the potential gaps in the security of a Europe with open borders.Law enforcement authorities issued a Europe-wide warrant on Wednesday for Mr. Amri, who migrated to Italy in 2011 and was imprisoned for four years in six different prisons in Sicily before making his way to Germany in 2015.Italy officially classified Mr. Amri as a terrorism risk after he threatened to decapitate a Christian cellmate in prison in Palermo in 2014, according to Lorenzo Vidino, who chairs an Italian commission of experts on radicalization that was formed this fall.\u201cHe was basically a troublemaker, very aggressive and very violent. And then from there, he starts a whole trajectory,\u201d said Mr. Vidino, who said that the Tunisian migrant was arrested soon after his arrival by boat on the Italian island of Lampedusa in 2011, after back-to-back arson episodes. \u201cHe establishes a track record of bad behavior, which at the beginning was just aggressive and threatening and disrespectful. But in the last place, where he was held in a high-security prison in Palermo, he showed signs of radicalism.\u201dMaps and photos of the manhunt for the attacker at a Christmas market in Berlin.The threat to his cellmate was considered serious enough that officials added him to Italy\u2019s database of radicalized individuals, a list that includes only a few hundred names, said Mr. Vidino, who is also the director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University.Both Italy and Germany tried to deport him to Tunisia but were thwarted by a lack of documents and cooperation from his home country.Even after Mr. Amri was named as the prime suspect in the attack in Berlin, he was able to roam freely around Europe, his face plastered across the news media and a reward of more than $100,000 on his head.\u201cThis mobility is great for the law-abiding and equally great for the non-law-abiding,\u201d said Douglas H. Wise, a former senior C.I.A. officer, of the borderless travel within the European Union.What Mr. Amri did in the four days between the attack in Berlin and when he was ultimately killed in Sesto San Giovanni, a suburb north of central Milan, is not clear, but that is now the subject of an intense investigation that the authorities remain reluctant to discuss.Asked on Friday when exactly the authorities began to view Mr. Amri as a suspect, the head of Germany\u2019s federal criminal police, Holger M\u00fcnch, restated in general terms that it was on Tuesday, after investigators found an identity document in a wallet in the cab of the tractor-trailer used in the attack.The police have not said why the wallet was not discovered on Monday, when the attack occurred and a murdered driver was found in the cab. On Friday, Mr. M\u00fcnch for the first time mentioned that an alias was involved, but he said the police had quickly linked it to Mr. Amri.In Italy, Mr. Vidino said that a train ticket found on Mr. Amri\u2019s body showed that he had traveled by train to Turin in Italy from the French town of Chamb\u00e9ry, near the border between the two nations. But there is no trail suggesting how he got from Berlin to Chamb\u00e9ry.A senior European counterterrorism official said that the delay in identifying Mr. Amri probably gave him a crucial head start of several hours to flee Germany, and that he would have been able to buy a train ticket to France and Italy without showing identification papers.Facial-recognition software on surveillance cameras in Europe is still in rudimentary form in most places, the official said, so even after Mr. Amri was identified, he could have slipped through the train stations undetected, especially if he was wearing a hat or hood.Mr. Amri\u2019s ability to hide through the week and make his way from Germany, through France, to Italy also raised questions of whether he had the help of a broader network, particularly one possibly linked to the Islamic State.The group called Mr. Amri \u201ca soldier\u201d in the video released on Friday, in which Mr. Amri proclaimed loyalty to its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and declared that the attack in Berlin was intended to avenge coalition airstrikes in Syria that have killed civilians.The video was evidently filmed in the Moabit district of northern Berlin, on the Kieler bridge. The autumn foliage seen on trees suggested it was filmed in fall or even early December.\u201cThere is high suspicion that he was behind the departure of a number of Germans to Syria \u2014 as many as two dozen \u2014 but the intelligence is not clear as to his exact role, whether in radicalization, recruitment or terror financing,\u201d said Laith Alkhouri, a director at Flashpoint, a business risk intelligence company in New York that tracks militant and cyber threats.In a telephone call from the suspect\u2019s hometown in Tunisia, Mr. Amri\u2019s older brother, Walid, said that the family wondered whether he became radicalized while in jail in Italy. After his brother was released, he informed the family that he was leaving for Germany \u201cwith friends he had made in jail,\u201d Walid Amri said.Also unknown is whether Mr. Amri had any accomplices in the Berlin attack \u2014 a question that Peter Frank, Germany\u2019s top federal prosecutor, identified as a priority for investigators.\u201cIt is very important now to determine if there was a network of cooperators, a network of supporters, accessories or assistants helping him to prepare the attack, execute the attack and also to escape,\u201d he said at a news conference on Friday in Karlsruhe, Germany.The only uncertainty that seemed to be settled on Friday was that the man killed was indeed Mr. Amri.\u201cThere is absolutely no doubt that the person who was killed was Anis Amri, the suspect in the terrorist attack in Berlin,\u201d the Italian interior minister, Marco Minniti, said at a news conference.\u201cAs soon as this person entered our country, he was the most wanted man in Europe, and we immediately identified him and neutralized him,\u201d Mr. Minniti said. \u201cThis means that our security is working really well.\u201dSome analysts, however, said that Mr. Amri\u2019s flight over the past 72 hours from German to Italy through France underscored Europe\u2019s porous border controls. \u201cTerrorists with multiple false identification documents are able to exploit Europe\u2019s open borders. Just as Amri arrived in Europe and moved almost seamlessly around the continent before the Berlin attack, he was able to do the same after it,\u201d said Seth G. Jones, a terrorism specialist at the RAND Corporation.Mr. Amri traveled from Turin to Central Station in Milan, where he arrived around 1 a.m. Friday. Surveillance cameras in the Milan train station recorded Mr. Amri\u2019s movements, Italian investigators said. It was not clear how Mr. Amri made his way to Sesto San Giovanni, about four miles away.\u201cHow he traveled there and what he was doing there are subject to delicate investigations,\u201d Mr. De Iesu, of the Milan police, said at the news conference. \u201cWe have to understand whether he was in transit or was awaiting someone.\u201dSesto San Giovanni is a \u201ca strategic hub for transportation,\u201d the town\u2019s deputy mayor, Andrea Rivolta, said in an interview at city hall. \u201cSesto is a junction for the railway system, the Milan metro, municipal buses and buses that reach all of Europe,\u201d as well as southern Italy.According to the account provided by Mr. De Iesu, Mr. Amri was standing alone on a piazza in Sesto San Giovanni, next to the northern terminus of a subway line.When the officers stopped him and asked for identification, he responded, in good Italian with a North African accent, that he was not carrying any documents on him. They asked him to empty his pockets and backpack. He was carrying a small knife and the equivalent of a few hundred dollars, but no cellphone.But then he pulled out a pistol, Mr. De Iesu said.\u201cIt was a regular patrol, under the new system of intensified police checks on the territory,\u201d he said. \u201cThey had no perception that it could be him, otherwise they\u2019d have been more careful.\u201dThe officer whom Mr. Amri shot, identified as Cristian Movio, was wounded in the shoulder and had surgery on Friday. The other officer, who shot Mr. Amri, was identified as Luca Scat\u00e0.Elisabetta Povoledo reported from Sesto San Giovanni, Gaia Pianigiani from Rome and Rukmini Callimachi from New York.

{"Headline": "Uncertainty Over New Chinese Law Rattles Foreign Nonprofits", "Date": "2016-12-29", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 The hotline rings, but nobody answers.China\u2019s Ministry of Public Security opened the line last month to answer questions about the new law regulating foreign nonprofit organizations, which takes effect on Sunday.But this week and last, calls went unanswered, exemplifying the uncertainty that still surrounds the law, raising concern among thousands of nongovernmental organizations about their ability to continue their work in the new year.Under the law, foreign nonprofits such as foundations, charities and many business associations must register with the police, persuade state agencies and organizations to act as their sponsors, and submit regular, detailed reports on their activities.According to an official estimate, there are 7,000 foreign nongovernmental organizations in China. They range from well-known institutions like the Ford Foundation and Oxfam to groups of a few people working on issues like rural education, nature conservation and health care.But groups working on politically sensitive issues like human rights, legal reform and the rule of law, or those concerning ethnic minorities, are seen as most at risk.Some foreign organizations have already pulled back. The American Bar Association, which has a program providing training and support to strengthen the rule of law, recently closed its Beijing office until it could gain formal approval for its work.Elizabeth Andersen, the association\u2019s associate executive director, cited the \u201cheightened scrutiny of foreign organizations working in China and the uncertainties and lack of information surrounding how the new law will be implemented.\u201dBut the uncertainty has also unsettled groups far removed from political concerns. Numerous aspects of the law remain opaque, and many groups are anxious about the vagueness and expense of the new requirements, while some fear their work will be curtailed or even banned.The local police, with whom her group must now register, had been helpful, but \u201cthey are still figuring it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe rules haven\u2019t been made completely clear to them yet.\u201d\u201cThis will mean that the government is able to more closely monitor the foreign NGOs, and, more importantly, the Chinese citizens working and interacting with them, while allowing them to continue the work that the government deems beneficial,\u201d Ms. Teets said by email. \u201cThe NGOs have every right to fear the closing off of space for advocacy and programs, but I think the impact will be really differentiated.\u201dAfter Deng Xiaoping opened up China in the 1980s, foreign foundations, associations and charities became important channels for sharing money, ideas and inspiration. Officials often welcomed their help, especially in poorer parts of the country, even though the rules governing their status were murky.But certain kinds of organizations, especially those that work in law and contentious social issues, have garnered distrust. Through the new law, the government wants to narrow permissible activities of foreign groups and monitor their work much more thoroughly.Those working on legal issues will have a much narrower foothold. \u201cHuman rights,\u201d for example, is not on the list of permitted issues.The groups\u2019 worries have been compounded by confusion about many requirements, the belated release of crucial rules, and signs that public security bureaus are poorly prepared for their new role.But it is not just activists and charities who are concerned. The opaque rules mean that organizations such as business groups, universities and education programs that seemingly pose no political threat are also unclear whether they must register for some of their activities.\u201cBusiness and trade associations, civil society, environmental groups and educational institutions that are concerned about how their operations in China may be affected\u201d have met with American diplomats to discuss the law, said Mary Beth Polley, a spokeswoman for the American Embassy in Beijing.\u201cWe remain deeply concerned about the uncertainties and potentially hostile environment for foreign nonprofit, nongovernment organizations and their Chinese partners that this law creates,\u201d she said.Foreign organizations working in China have long had to seek out domestic agencies or organizations to act as their sponsors. But the new law narrows the list of permissible sponsors, and those permitted may be reluctant to take on the risk of vouching for foreign groups, or feel they do not have the personnel available for the task.While some foreign organizations are resigned to months of uncertainty, some said they would keep working full time in the country, confident that public security offices will let them stay open while the registration is ironed out. Several American trade associations said they thought they would be allowed to stay, and some groups said they looked forward to gaining official status under the new rules.But organizations working on legal issues or social problems said they were unsure of their futures and may face hard choices. Registration may mean sacrificing autonomy, but the alternative may be abandoning people in China who need their help, said Mr. Kellogg of the Open Society Foundations.\u201cI would urge foreign NGOs to adopt a wait-and-see attitude before they make any final decisions about either registering or pulling out of China,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce there is more clarity about how the law will be enforced, it will be at least a bit easier to come up with mitigation strategies.\u201dRyan McMorrow contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fearing Loss of U.S. Money Under Trump, New York Begins Urgent Review", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byOfficials are conducting an urgent review of the billions of dollars that New York City receives each year from the federal government to identify the streams of money that may be most at risk once President-elect Donald J. Trump takes office.Mr. Trump, a Republican, has threatened to punish cities that defy his efforts to deport undocumented immigrants, and there is also concern that the Republican-controlled Congress may seek to slash longstanding aid programs.\u201cThere\u2019s urgency because the threat seems greater than it\u2019s been,\u201d said Tony Shorris, the first deputy mayor, referring to the effort to identify which programs may be most at risk. \u201cThere\u2019s also uncertainty because the lack of clarity is much greater than it\u2019s been.\u201dOfficials said the federal government could not just eliminate all of the city\u2019s financing, which flows to many programs, each bound by laws and regulations.Some kinds of financing are more vulnerable than others. Some cuts may require congressional action through the budget process or by changes to laws that require programs, Mr. Shorris said. But there are other types of financing that the president or federal agencies he controls could eliminate or suspend unilaterally.Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller, whose office has also begun to study the potential effect on the city of any federal cuts, said it was difficult to predict what actions Mr. Trump might take.\u201cDonald Trump is unpredictable and he says one thing one day and he does another the next,\u201d Mr. Stringer, a Democrat, said. He added that the greater danger were the deep cuts Congress might make to programs that Republicans have long wanted to slash.\u201cWith a Republican Congress,\u201d Mr. Stringer said, \u201cif their rhetoric creates actionable items, we could potentially constrict or collapse the safety net in the city and that is a very real threat to the survival of a lot of vulnerable New Yorkers.\u201dEric F. Phillips, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s press secretary, said city lawyers and budget officials were preparing what he called an \u201cexposure sheet,\u201d highlighting programs that may be most vulnerable.Though city officials had promised to provide details of their work, they reversed course abruptly this week and refused to offer additional information.\u201cThe legal and financial analysis of our potential exposure is not yet complete,\u201d Mr. Phillips said in an email.Estimates vary as to how much money the city receives from the federal government, but a study by the city\u2019s Independent Budget Office put the total last year at about $7 billion. A review by Mr. Stringer\u2019s office estimated the amount for the current fiscal year, which began on July 1, at somewhat higher than that, though less than 9 percent of the city\u2019s overall budget, excluding recovery aid related to Hurricane Sandy.Mr. Shorris said that concerns went beyond direct federal financing of city programs.One threat is connected to Republican vows to repeal or weaken the Affordable Care Act. If that happened and large numbers of city residents lost their health insurance as a result, they would most likely seek care in city-run hospitals. That would greatly increase the burden on those hospitals, the largest provider of care to uninsured New Yorkers.Legal precedent may require that any cuts to federal funding be related to an issue in dispute between the city and the federal government. If, for instance, the city refused to allow the Police Department to cooperate with deportation raids, it could put money tied to the criminal justice system at risk.A city official familiar with the effort to identify vulnerable programs said it was unlikely that the federal government would seek to reduce financing aimed at helping New York fight terrorism. But the official, who was not authorized to comment publicly on internal discussions and asked not to be identified, said there were other, smaller funding streams that could be affected.Those include federal grants that could pay for programs meant to create alternatives to incarceration or for creating educational or rehabilitative programing within the city\u2019s jails.Programs outside the criminal justice system may also be vulnerable, such as those that receive federal money for programs that specifically serve immigrants in areas such as adult literacy and work force development.Carol Kellermann, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, said she was skeptical that Mr. Trump would go too far in seeking to punish New York, particularly because of his ties to the city.\u201cThey\u2019re going to do things that hurt cities, that hurt the president\u2019s city, where the president is a real estate developer and cares about long-term property values?\u201d Ms. Kellerman said. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. I hope these things don\u2019t happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sweeping Health Measure, Backed by Obama, Passes Senate", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate approved complex health care legislation on Wednesday that would increase funding for disease research, address weaknesses in the nation\u2019s mental health systems and vastly alter the regulatory system for drugs and medical devices. The vote sealed a final legislative victory for President Obama, who strongly supported the bill against objections from many liberal Democrats and consumer groups.In many ways the bill, known as the 21st Century Cures Act, is a return to a more classic approach to legislation, with policy victories and some disappointments for both parties, and potential benefits for nearly every American whose life has been touched by illness, drug addiction and mental health issues. Years in the making, the measure passed 94 to 5 after being overwhelmingly approved by the House last week.One major winner \u2014 and a donor to both parties \u2014 was the pharmaceutical industry; its role set off fierce but futile opposition by Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts. On many of the areas addressed by the bill, pharmaceutical companies were in step with the interests of patients desperate for cures, an unusual and emotionally charged alliance between an industry and its consumers.The bill was a test of Ms. Warren\u2019s muscle, exercised from the far left of the Senate Democratic caucus, and it is one that did not go well. \u201cI will fight it,\u201d she said of the bill last week on the Senate floor, \u201cbecause I know the difference between compromise and extortion.\u201dIn the end, however, not a single member of her home state, which has many medical research centers joined her. Nor did anyone else apart from three other left-leaning senators \u2014 Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, both of Oregon \u2014 and Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah.The measure would benefit people with mental illness and chronic diseases, biomedical researchers, pregnant women, hospitals, children with diabetes, people addicted to opioid drugs, children who are bullied, and those who are gravely ill.\u201cI doubt that there is a family in America who will not be touched by this important legislation,\u201d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine.In a statement issued after the Senate vote, Mr. Obama said, \u201cThe Cures Act makes important investments that will save lives.\u201d\u201cThis is a reminder of what we can do when we look out for one another,\u201d the president said. \u201cLike Joe Biden and so many other Americans, I\u2019ve lost people I love deeply to cancer. I\u2019ve heard often from those whose loved ones are suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s, addiction and other debilitating diseases. Their heartbreak is real, and so we have a responsibility to respond with real solutions. This bill will make a big difference, and I look forward to signing it as soon as it reaches my desk.\u201dWhile Republicans and Democrats often fight over government spending, the bill benefited from its largess to one agency that has broad support, the National Institutes of Health.\u201cI don\u2019t think there is enough money that we can put into the N.I.H.,\u201d said Representative Steve Cohen, Democrat of Tennessee, \u201cbecause it is important and it affects all Americans independent of political party, race, sexual orientation \u2014 you name it.\u201dThe bill gives the health institutes the authority to finance high-risk, high-reward research using special procurement procedures, as opposed to more conventional grants and contracts. It also requires the agency\u2019s director to establish \u201cEureka prize\u201d competitions to advance biomedical research and improve treatments for serious illnesses.The bill raises the status of mental health issues by creating a new assistant secretary for mental health and substance use, to be appointed by the president.It directs federal agencies to step up enforcement of laws that require equal insurance coverage for mental and physical illnesses. Federal laws and rules requiring mental health parity have been adopted with bipartisan support over the last 20 years, but a White House task force found recently that compliance was lagging.\u201cWe didn\u2019t get everything we needed,\u2019\u201d said Representative Tim Murphy, Republican of Pennsylvania, the architect of provisions to improve the treatment of mental illness, \u201cbut we needed everything we got.\u201dMajor provisions of the bill push the Food and Drug Administration to speed the review and approval of drugs and medical devices. Kim Monk of Capital Alpha Partners, a policy research firm for investors, described the bill as \u201ca holiday win for much of the health sector.\u201dScott Whitaker, president and chief executive of the Advanced Medical Technology Association, a trade group for device makers, hailed the bill for creating \u201can expedited pathway for breakthrough medical technologies \u2013 those that offer the best hope for patients with life-threatening diseases\u201d and few treatment options. In reviewing new devices, the bill says, the F.D.A. shall consider the \u201cleast burdensome\u201d means of showing their safety.In considering whether to approve new drugs or new uses for medications, the bill says, the F.D.A. shall pay more attention to \u201cpatient experience data\u201d showing the impact of a disease or treatment on patients\u2019 lives, and their treatment preferences.The legislation does not include provisions to rein in prescription drug prices, a significant victory for the pharmaceutical industry. Consultants to the industry said that drug makers had kept a low profile in their lobbying on the legislation, knowing that any conversations on Capitol Hill could turn quickly to drug prices.\u201cWhen the cost of our prescription drugs is skyrocketing, this bill does nothing to combat excessive prices,\u201d said Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the senior Democrat on the Appropriations subcommittee on health and human services. She voted against the measure.\u201cWhile the bill authorizes $4.8 billion to the N.I.H. over the next 10 years \u2014 on average, a mere $480 million a year \u2014 this is barely a quarter per year of what the House passed last year,\u201d Ms. DeLauro said. \u201cThere is also no guarantee that the appropriators will follow through and provide funding each year.\u201dRepresentative Kathy Castor, Democrat of Florida, who voted for the bill, said she too wished that more of the money had been guaranteed. \u201cMedical research in America today should not be subject to the whims of congressional budget battles or political fights,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Avianca Weighs Bids, Hedge Fund Plays Unusual Role: Diplomat", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byTrouble was brewing this summer at Avianca Holdings, Latin America\u2019s second-biggest airline.Tight on cash, the airline needed to raise money. For many on the board, one option was selling part of the company.The company\u2019s largest investor \u2014 a swashbuckling, Bolivian-born entrepreneur, Germ\u00e1n Efromovich \u2014 had other ideas. The airline was the thread holding together the remnants of his once-powerful empire spanning oil and gas businesses, shipyards, hotels and airlines. He was not about to let it go without a fight.A number of suitors, including Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and Copa Airlines of Panama, indicated interest in buying a stake \u2014 including buying out Mr. Efromovich and his brother, Jos\u00e9 \u2014 but the two made it known that they were not ready to relinquish control, people with knowledge of the negotiations said. Mr. Efromovich was often at odds with Avianca\u2019s second-biggest shareholder, Roberto Kriete.Tensions in the boardroom were so high in recent months that there were shouting matches in some meetings.But there was a struggle on another front that would soon bring the parties together. Mr. Efromovich, after making big bets on the energy industry before oil prices plummeted, was on the brink of default on hundreds of millions of dollars in loans. The lender was Paul E. Singer and his hedge fund, Elliott Management, best known for its decade-long battle with Argentina over its defaulted debt. And some of the collateral was Mr. Efromovich\u2019s stake in Avianca.That has brought Elliott\u2019s executives to the negotiating table in recent months, meeting with Avianca\u2019s suitors, participating in board meetings and keeping an eye on their borrower.Late last week, Delta, United and Copa submitted bids to partner with Avianca. Elliott received copies of at least some of the offersUnited offered a $500 million loan to Avianca and potentially one of its investors. Copa pursued a merger that would value Avianca at more than $2 billion, or a 150 percent premium to its share price last week. Delta offered more than $1 billion in cash, a majority of which would go to buy out most of the Synergy Group, Mr. Efromovich\u2019s investment arm, with the rest going to Avianca. The Delta bid implied a $1.9 billion valuation.On Tuesday, a special committee of Avianca\u2019s board are expected to meet to decide whether to accept a bid or proceed with a new round of bids.If a deal comes together, Elliott would have helped broker one of the biggest deals in the airline industry this year.Details of these discussions are based on interviews with people who have direct knowledge of the company and negotiations but who were not authorized to speak publicly.American Airlines is the only United States airline with a substantial presence in the region.\u201cThese players have no footprint,\u201d said Stephen Trent, an analyst who covers Latin American aerospace and transportation for Citigroup, in reference to the three bidders\u2019 exposure to Avianca\u2019s routes.Delta and United declined to comment on the deal. Copa did not respond to a request for comment.Avianca also declined to comment. But in the company\u2019s most recent earnings call in November, the chief executive, Hern\u00e1n Rinc\u00f3n Lema, emphasized that Avianca\u2019s financial situation was stronger than when it began the bidding process.\u201cFrom the very beginning, when we\u2019ve set to find a strategic long-term partner, it has never been about money,\u201d he added in a call with analysts. \u201cIt has been about the strategy, future, service, the world.\u201dWhile Mr. Efromovich and his brother hold seats on the Avianca board, there is some question over whether they still own their shares. In an interview, Mr. Efromovich said that while his Synergy Group had a majority stake in Avianca, he was no longer a majority owner of Synergy. \u201cThat has changed over time,\u201d he said.\u201cI don\u2019t have to share my relationship with Elliott, not only with Elliott but with a lot of funds. And this is my business,\u201d said Mr. Efromovich, acknowledging a relationship with Elliott. \u201cIt\u2019s my problem.\u201dIn September, Mr. Efromovich told Valor Econ\u00f4mico, a business daily in Brazil, that he had given up his shares in Avianca Holdings.\u201cIn Avianca Holdings, I don\u2019t have a single share,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Synergy Group gave as collateral part of its shares\u201d in Avianca Holdings \u201cin order to finance airplanes and other things.\u201dAsked if he still held a stake in Synergy, he said, \u201cNot today.\u201dBetter known as a combatant than a diplomat, Elliott has emerged at Avianca as a result of a two-decade-long relationship with Mr. Efromovich that executives first disclosed to Avianca\u2019s board members this summer.Elliott has long specialized in taking positions in complicated loan arrangements, most notably its investment in defaulted Argentine debt, and over the years Elliott has helped to bankroll the expansion of Mr. Efromovich\u2019s Synergy Group. Most recently, Elliott helped to finance Mr. Efromovich\u2019s foray into Brazilian shipyards through a series of loans that were secured to other assets in the empire, including Avianca.Business associates describe Mr. Efromovich as like a wildcatter, given his diverse investments that span not just South America but also a variety of industries, including energy, shipbuilding and telecommunications. He created Synergy Group, with his brother, Jos\u00e9, to serve as the investment vehicle for his many ventures.Decades ago, Avianca suffered some major safety setbacks. The Medell\u00edn drug cartel blew up one plane over Bogot\u00e1 in 1989, and the next year a plane crashed en route to New York. Combined, almost 200 people were killed.That led Avianca to economic ruin, and in 2004 Mr. Efromovich spotted an opportunity to swoop in. He agreed to buy 75 percent of the company out of bankruptcy for a mere $64 million. (Today Synergy\u2019s publicly disclosed 52 percent stake is worth about $460 million.) Five years later, Avianca agreed to merge with Grupo Taca, combining two of the oldest airlines in Latin America.Taca had been controlled by the Kriete family since the 1960s, growing into one of the largest airlines in the region. Through civil wars and political unrest over the next few decades, the family held on to the business and founded an aircraft maintenance facility that services many of the world\u2019s major airlines.Mr. Kriete, a Salvadoran who has a master of business administration from Boston College, took control from his grandfather in the 1980s. He currently is a director of Avianca and the second-largest investor in the company after Mr. Efromovich.The combination of Mr. Efromovich\u2019s and Mr. Kriete\u2019s companies was amicable at the beginning.When asked about their relationship, Mr. Efromovich called Mr. Kriete a good partner and \u201can experienced man in the industry,\u201d adding that his contribution to the board was \u201cvery positive.\u201dNot long after the public offering, the ties between the Efromoviches and Mr. Kriete began to fray. Mr. Efromovich brought Avianca into deals with some of his other business interests, known as related-party transactions. These arrangements are legal, so long as they are conducted in the best interest of the company and its shareholders.But some shareholders found the transactions to be wasteful and accused Mr. Efromovich of propping up some of his other businesses.There was Empresariales, a bus company and affiliate of Synergy that provided ground transportation to the company\u2019s pilots and flight attendants. Avianca paid for services that Empresariales had not completed, according to people familiar with an internal review.There was also Synergy\u2019s aircraft leasing company, which delivered two A330 aircraft late. The delay and cost of changes to the aircraft to meet Avianca\u2019s standards cost $7.5 million, the people said.\u201cTo me, a related-party transaction has to be at arm\u2019s length,\u201d Mr. Kriete said by phone. \u201cWhen the company does things with Germ\u00e1n that they wouldn\u2019t do with anybody else, that\u2019s a contaminated related-party transaction.\u201dBoth Mr. Kriete and Mr. Efromovich have threatened lawsuits against each other, but nothing has been filed.Vinod Sreeharsha contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Niger Feels Ripple Effect of Boko Haram as Fears of Food Shortage Spread", "Date": "2016-12-12", "News": "Supported byDIFFA, Niger \u2014 Only 2 years old, Fatouma Ouseini lay in a hospital room, undernourished and listless from fever.Fatouma and her family fled from just across the border in northeastern Nigeria, the epicenter of the war with Boko Haram, where scattered areas have teetered on the brink of famine for most of this year, according to the United Nations. Now, some aid workers fear that similar conditions could spill over to bordering areas like here in Niger, putting even more children at risk.More than 70,000 people fled their homes along the border between Niger and Nigeria in the first half of this year after militant attacks increased. Many have resettled in Diffa, living in labyrinth-like neighborhoods of mud-brick homes, competing with longtime residents for food and water.Children like Fatouma are so common that the town\u2019s small hospital has dedicated an entire wing to treating malnutrition and the illnesses that stem from it.\u201cAt home, we had everything to eat and drink,\u201d said Hadja Mahamadou, Fatouma\u2019s aunt, who accompanied her to the hospital. \u201cHere, we\u2019re waiting always for food.\u201dEven in normal times, northeast Nigeria and areas along the borders of Niger, Cameroon and Chad often suffer from a lack of food. It is home to some of the poorest people and highest birthrates on the planet, and their fate often lies with the quality of the year\u2019s crop.But farming is all the more difficult now. Some farmers have shifted to only crops that grow close to the ground so militants cannot hide in fields. Some farmers are able to sleep in encampments for safety at night, returning periodically to check on crops.Elsewhere, the presence of militants has prevented farmers from going to their fields. In some areas, farmers have missed the last three harvest seasons.Nigeria has been particularly hard hit. It continues to writhe from a drop in oil prices that set off a currency devaluation and now a recession. Food prices have soared even in major cities far from areas where Boko Haram operates. High prices have rippled into neighboring countries that rely on Nigeria for trade.Some aid workers complain that Nigeria\u2019s government, which prides itself on being one of Africa\u2019s biggest economies, had been reluctant to accept help from food delivery groups until this summer. This fall, a Nigerian Senate report said $8 million in aid meant for the northeast had been misallocated or had disappeared.President Muhammadu Buhari, who pledged during his campaign to rid the country of Boko Haram after years of torment, has declared the militants defeated despite their continued attacks.This month, the United Nations announced that it needed about three times as much money as it originally expected to mitigate the food crisis and other problems in the region, which are likely to continue in Nigeria at least until the harvest season at the end of 2017. The organization, which has struggled to raise money to help the region, is now asking for $1 billion for northeastern Nigeria.\u201cWe have underestimated the scale and complexity of the crisis in northern Nigeria,\u201d said Peter Lundberg, the United Nations\u2019 deputy humanitarian coordinator in Nigeria.Mr. Buhari immediately dismissed the appeal, insisting that the world organization was exaggerating the humanitarian crisis in his country to increase donations. In a statement signed by his spokesman, Mr. Buhari said the United Nations was engaging in \u201ca type of hype that does not provide a solution to the situation on the ground but more to do with calculations for operations financing locally and abroad.\u201dLater, the government\u2019s official Twitter account posted that it recognized the severity of the humanitarian situation.While crediting the United Nations with immeasurable help to assuage the food situation, Mr. Buhari said, \u201cThe hype, especially that which suggests that the government is doing nothing is, therefore, uncharitable and unnecessary,\u201d according to the statement.\u201cWe are concerned about the blatant attempts to whip up a nonexistent fear of mass starvation by some aid agencies, a type of hype that does not provide a solution to the situation on the ground but more to do with calculations for operations financing locally and abroad,\u201d the statement said.Col. Adamu Laka of the Nigerian military said some areas of Nigeria \u2014 like Bama, a city where humanitarian groups had described severe malnourishment after it was liberated from Boko Haram control in June \u2014 were so flush with food that the military had told the authorities to slow shipments. But he said few farmers in the area had cultivated their own fields and instead were relying on relief food.\u201cRight now, there is no problem of food in Bama,\u201d he said. But if the relief stops, \u201cthat is when there will be a problem.\u201dIn Nigeria, the threat of militants has blocked access for aid groups like the United Nations\u2019 World Food Program to some villages until midyear. The organization initially handed out cash and vouchers for food, a system that officials now acknowledge was a mistake in an area where inflation had set in. Now, the United Nations is directly distributing rice and other food.But encampments of displaced people, even in the accessible and relatively safe Nigerian city of Maiduguri, with its huge markets, still lack enough food and water. A United Nations assessment showed that one informal camp called Muna Garage, home to 17,000 people who have fled militants, is in dire need of water wells and food.\u201cNo one here is dying of starvation, but with chronic malnutrition, when they get malaria or any other communicable disease, they die from it,\u201d said Mr. Lundberg, who acknowledged past gaps in the agency\u2019s handling of the food crisis.Poor coordination and major turnover in leadership have dogged agencies of the United Nations, criticisms that were pointed out in a stinging letter sent last month to the organization\u2019s emergency directors by officials at the European Union.\u201cRecent reports indicate that even where access is relatively good, like in parts of Maiduguri, scaled-up delivery has been inadequate and emergency conditions prevail for the local population,\u201d the letter said.Mr. Lundberg conceded the criticisms but said they were outdated. The organization recently set up offices in northeast Nigeria, brought in experts who dealt with famine in South Sudan and is working \u201cin a completely different way to address the gaps that clearly were there.\u201dHere in Niger, humanitarian workers say food deliveries are flowing. At one encampment outside Diffa on a blazing recent afternoon, hundreds of people gathered alongside a truck for handouts from the International Rescue Committee with pink bags of Happy Family brand rice, macaroni, palm oil, bouillon and other food.Fati Fougou, 40, who has been running from Boko Haram for two years, had been waiting for the shipment since she returned from morning prayers. She said each ration was supposed to be a month\u2019s worth of food for one family. But hers, intended to feed her and her seven children, generally runs out after 25 days.\u201cIt\u2019s not sufficient,\u201d Ms. Fougou said. \u201cBut it\u2019s good to have.\u201dChris Stein contributed reporting from Lagos, Nigeria.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Abortion Foes, Emboldened by Trump, Promise \u2018Onslaught\u2019 of Tough Restrictions", "Date": "2016-12-11", "News": "Supported byCOLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 Christina Hagan, the youngest woman in the Ohio Legislature, received a surprise last week. The toughest piece of abortion legislation in the country \u2014 a bill she had championed for years \u2014 suddenly passed.The measure, which would ban abortions after a heartbeat is detected, as early as six weeks, was long presumed dead. But now that Donald J. Trump is headed to the White House, the political winds have changed, and it passed with overwhelming majorities.So did a bill banning abortions after 20 weeks. Neither contains exceptions for rape and incest. Now Gov. John Kasich \u2014 a Republican who is an ardent abortion opponent and onetime challenger to Mr. Trump \u2014 is weighing whether to sign one or both.\u201cPresident-elect Trump has drastically shifted the dynamics,\u201d said Ms. Hagan, 28, a Republican who has served in the State House since 2011. \u201cI honestly could not have foreseen this victory a week or a month ago.\u201dThe effects of Mr. Trump\u2019s victory are only beginning to be felt. But one of the biggest changes is playing out in abortion politics. From the composition of the Supreme Court (Mr. Trump has promised to nominate staunchly anti-abortion justices), to efforts on Capitol Hill to enact a permanent ban on taxpayer-financed abortions, to emboldened Republican statehouses like the one in Ohio, combatants on both sides see legalized abortion imperiled as it has not been for decades.That includes, they agree, the possibility of overturning Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 abortion decision, during the Trump presidency.\u201cThis is the strongest the pro-life movement has been since 1973,\u201d said Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group, and the chairwoman of a coalition of abortion opponents that worked to elect Mr. Trump. \u201cWe are dealing now with a president who has not been playing the game in the way that other presidents, including Republicans, have.\u201dMr. Trump was elected after a decade of anti-abortion gains in state legislatures; Ohio is the 18th state to adopt a 20-week abortion ban, though two such bills, in Arizona and Idaho, did not survive constitutional challenges in federal court. States that preserve rights, like New York and California, are increasingly rare.\u201cI think we are standing on the precipice of a really dark time,\u201d said Ilyse Hogue, the president of Naral Pro-Choice America. She said that Mr. Trump had \u201czero mandate\u201d to roll back Roe, and that her group would fight back hard; its fund-raising and membership are up.Four states \u2014 Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota and South Dakota \u2014 have adopted \u201ctrigger bans\u201d that would automatically make abortion a crime if the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, leaving it to the states to decide on the legality of abortions. Mr. Strickland predicted that states would start \u201cfilling up the pipeline\u201d with anti-abortion bills.Others are more cautious.\u201cInstead of getting swept up in Trumpmania, let\u2019s be realistic and continue the incremental approach,\u201d said Michael Gonidakis, president of Ohio Right to Life, who pushed for Ohio\u2019s 20-week ban. \u201cJust because a Republican president appoints a justice doesn\u2019t mean that the court will fall our way.\u201dOnly four of the state\u2019s 95 counties have abortion clinics. Now, said Allison Glass, state director of Healthy and Free Tennessee, a coalition of reproductive rights groups, advocates fear \u201ca really extreme abortion ban.\u201dThose priorities include putting anti-abortion justices on the Supreme Court; passing a national 20-week ban like Ohio\u2019s; eliminating federal money for Planned Parenthood as long as its clinics perform abortions; and making permanent the Hyde Amendment, passed annually by Congress to ban taxpayer-funded abortions.\u201cThis is an attack on every single front,\u201d said Representative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois, a longtime defender of abortion rights. She predicted a \u201cfierce battle,\u201d beginning the day after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, when thousands of women are expected to march on Washington.In Ohio, just about everyone seems surprised that the so-called heartbeat bill passed. It would ban abortions after a fetal heartbeat was detected, usually between six and eight weeks, which is often before a woman even knows she is pregnant and is far earlier than any law on the books in the United States.Mainstream anti-abortion advocates opposed it on the grounds that it would never survive a court challenge (similar laws were struck down in North Dakota and Arkansas) and could mean a setback for their broader strategy of weakening one of the pillars of American abortion jurisprudence: the definition of medical viability of the fetus, currently understood to be around 24 weeks.\u201cEvery political adviser I spoke to told me not to carry this,\u201d Ms. Hagan said on Thursday, the last day of the state\u2019s legislative session. \u201cThey said: \u2018That\u2019s a lightning rod. Don\u2019t touch it.\u2019\u201dFor years it foundered. Janet Porter, president of Faith 2 Action, an anti-abortion group, tried many things to get it passed. She sent lawmakers teddy bears, roses and heart-shaped balloons. She reserved parts of the Statehouse for prayer meetings and rallies. She rented a small plane to fly overhead and drag a banner urging passage. Nothing worked.But on Tuesday, the bill popped up on the schedule, folded into other legislation at the last minute. Opponents were shocked.\u201cThere were no hearings. No legislative process at all,\u201d said Gabriel Mann, the communications manager for Naral Pro-Choice Ohio. \u201cJust all of a sudden, hey, this bill is back. And boom, it passed.\u201dEven supporters were surprised.\u201cAll of a sudden we discovered that, yes, lo and behold, we have life,\u201d Timothy E. Ginter, a Republican state representative, said. The first he heard the bill would be considered, he said, was the day it passed. \u201cThe heartbeat bill had a heartbeat,\u201d he added.Mr. Kasich has signed 17 anti-abortion measures since taking office in 2011, Mr. Mann said. During that time, the number of abortion providers in the state has been cut to nine from 16.Both bills, though overlapping, in theory could be signed into law. But many abortion supporters say the heartbeat provision is less likely to survive an immediate legal challenge, and thus a harder sell for Mr. Kasich.Clinics are worried. On a gray Friday outside Preterm, the largest abortion provider in Ohio, which is in suburban Cleveland, a protester yelled at people going inside. A few placards with pictures of babies were propped up against metal lawn chairs dusted with snow.\u201cOur phones have been ringing off the hook, primarily with the simple question: Is abortion still legal in Ohio?\u201d said Nancy R. Starner, director of development and communications for Preterm. She said the calls had started the day after the heartbeat bill passed.Angel Rucker, director of clinical services for Preterm, said 20 weeks was roughly the time when ultrasounds determined fetal anomalies.\u201cIt\u2019s very scary,\u201d she said of the new legislation. \u201cI\u2019m quite concerned for women.\u201d\u201cAbortion has been part of our culture for the last 50 years,\u201d Ms. Lehner said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just going to go away.\u201dSabrina Tavernise reported from Columbus, and Sheryl Gay Stolberg from Washington.Follow Sabrina Tavernise on Twitter: @stavernise Follow Sheryl Gay Stolberg on Twitter: @SherylNYTAdvertisement"}

A partner and senior counsel, he focused primarily on mortgage securitization for large banks, which became the heart of the financial crisis after the housing bubble burst. The market for structured financial products collapsed and he had little work to do. He realized it was time to get out.\u201cIt was a choice between starting over in the practice of law or trying something different,\u201d said Mr. Schwartz, who is 59.He sells a wide range of products for sci-fi and fantasy aficionados \u2014 like a \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d plush direwolf cub, a Harley Quinn mallet and a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles katana \u2014 through the company\u2019s website and at comic book conventions like Comic-Con International in San Diego.Character-based licensing has grown into a $113 billion industry worldwide, thanks in part to a rabid fan base for properties like Star Wars, DC and Marvel, said Rob Salkowitz, a consultant and author of \u201cComic-Con and the Business of Pop Culture.\u201d But he said entrepreneurs like Mr. Schwartz risked choosing the wrong license.\u201cThe value of the license rises and falls on the popularity of the property,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a licensee, that\u2019s out of your control.\u201dMr. Schwartz\u2019s early licenses were for smaller properties like \u201cThe Princess Bride\u201d and Garfield, but it was \u201cThe Green Hornet\u201d that finally brought him attention in the industry. Originally a radio show in the 1930s, it was rebooted in 2011 by Sony Pictures as a feature film starring Seth Rogen.\u201cWord on the street was that it was not going to do very well,\u201d Mr. Schwartz said. But he had a fondness for the 1960s TV series, which starred one of his idols, Bruce Lee. \u201cIt was an opportunity to work with Sony and show them my bona fides.\u201d\u201cThe Green Hornet\u201d movie and license flopped, but the experience offered Mr. Schwartz a valuable lesson: \u201cDon\u2019t let your personal opinions cloud your business judgment,\u201d he said.But there was a silver lining. \u201c\u2018The Green Hornet\u2019 was a steppingstone to proving ourselves in the licensing business,\u201d he said, leading to more lucrative licenses from Sony, including \u201cMen in Black\u201d and \u201cGhostbusters.\u201dEric A. Thomsen, a former licensing director in the consumer products department at Sony Pictures, worked with Mr. Schwartz on the deal for \u201cMen in Black\u201d and others.\u201cIt was a bit of a risk for us because his company wasn\u2019t proven,\u201d Mr. Thomsen said. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, he convinced me with his charm and enthusiasm.\u201dAt Cadwalader, there were already a few clues that Mr. Schwartz was a so-called fanboy. Lawrence D. Rubenstein, a managing counsel at Wells Fargo, worked with Mr. Schwartz for about 25 years and remembers a lightsaber prop displayed in Mr. Schwartz\u2019s office.\u201cHe had been thinking of this kind of thing for a while,\u201d Mr. Rubenstein said. \u201cIt was obvious he had a passion.\u201dThe lightsaber was a leftover from a failed investment that Mr. Schwartz made in 2001 in a company called Master Replicas, which made detailed replicas of Star Wars props but eventually folded.\u201cOne of my take-aways from Master Replicas is that if I was going to go into business again,\u201d Mr. Schwartz said, \u201cit would be entirely on my own and not have someone lose business for me.\u201dSo when the time was right, he left Wall Street for a second career in the collectible toy business.Practicing law provided a few tools that Mr. Schwartz said he applied to his new venture, including \u201ca 24/7 work ethic and a scrupulous attention to detail.\u201d\u201cIn structured finance, transactions always close, so you had to get focused and you had to hustle,\u201d he said. \u201cTake that and bring it into a sleepy toy business.\u201dLeveraging his success with Sony Pictures, Mr. Schwartz was able to make Factory Entertainment profitable in 2013 while keeping costs low with a lean staff of eight in Concord, Calif.But he still keeps his ties to Wall Street, maintaining an office in New York at Cadwalader and working as a board member of the Structured Finance Industry Group, a trade organization. \u201cI worked with clients and industry groups to analyze the problems that led to the crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cI did things like that to help the markets come back.\u201dHis second career has taught him to be more flexible, letting go of 18-hour work days for himself and his staff. \u201cIt\u2019s not reasonable to expect that same sort of 100 percent commitment day and night that you expect from young lawyers on Wall Street,\u201d he said.He said the collectibles business helped him develop a thick skin, too. Wall Street clients never complained about his work, but his fellow fanboys could be very demanding when it came to their favorite comic book superheroes.\u201cThere is small number of people who like to vent their spleen on the internet,\u201d he said, \u201cbut below that, there is a mountain of people who are happy.\u201dAnd it is those satisfied customers who serve as a reminder of what led to his second career, he said.\u201cI\u2019m very fortunate,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not insensitive enough to forget that a lot of people suffered greatly during the Great Recession and still are.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Citi Bike Under Pressure to Expand to Low-Income Neighborhoods", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byCiti Bike stations have cropped up this year in brownstone Brooklyn and on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Next year, the blue bicycles will inch farther afield into Harlem and Astoria in Queens.Back from the verge of bankruptcy, Citi Bike is widely viewed as a success. With tens of thousands of people using the bikes each day, it has become an increasingly popular way to navigate New York City.But the nation\u2019s largest bike-share system is now confronting a larger question: Is it an amenity for mostly affluent neighborhoods, or a public transportation system for all New Yorkers?Some city leaders are calling for Citi Bike to expand for the first time to the Bronx and Staten Island.\u201cIt is imperative that we turn Citi Bike fully into a public good and a resource for our lowest income communities,\u201d Councilman Ydanis Rodriguez, a Democrat from northern Manhattan, said at a recent City Council hearing on the program\u2019s future.Citi Bike officials say the system might not extend to all five boroughs unless the city is willing to help pay for it, an idea that the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, is considering. For some elected city officials, the arrival of Citi Bike in Jersey City last year was yet another slight for their oft-neglected communities.\u201cHow could Citi Bike go to New Jersey before it goes to all five boroughs?\u201d Ruben Diaz Jr., the Bronx borough president, said in a statement last week. \u201cThe city in Citi Bike has to mean something.\u201d\u201cI do not believe that you can look to a big expansion without some degree of public support,\u201d Jay Walder, Motivate\u2019s chief executive, told City Council members at the recent hearing.Polly Trottenberg, the city\u2019s transportation commissioner, said some city financing would probably be needed, noting that New York City\u2019s system was the only bike-share program in the country that did not receive public money. Installing new stations costs about $6,000 per bike, she said, and a citywide system could require as many as 80,000 bikes. She said the city had begun to discuss the next round of expansion with Motivate, but declined to say how much financing the city might provide.Another challenge for Citi Bike is attracting a diversity of riders, including low-income residents, minorities and women, who have been slow to embrace the bikes. The company works with community groups to recruit new riders and offers residents of public housing a discounted monthly rate of $5, opposed to the regular $14.95. About 1,100 people have joined through the public housing program.When a Citi Bike station appeared in front of her home at the Walt Whitman Houses in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, Shaquana Boykin barely noticed.\u201cI thought Citi Bike was very expensive,\u201d Ms. Boykin said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any education to what it was.\"With a discounted membership, Ms. Boykin, 26, said she now rode every day unless it was raining, snowing or under 40 degrees. She leads community rides to farmers\u2019 markets in Brooklyn and uses the bikes so often that each ride costs her about 9 cents \u2014 much less than a $2.75 MetroCard swipe.\u201cI felt like a little kid again,\u201d she said of getting back on a bicycle.In Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, at the outer edge of Citi Bike territory, membership has grown to 5,381 members, up by nearly 2,000 people since last year, when Citi Bike began working with a local nonprofit to attract riders. Some of the strategies have included community rides to make residents more comfortable on bikes and marketing posters highlighting minority riders.\u201cThere was a perception that the bike share system was not for us, that it was part of gentrification,\u201d said Tracey Capers, an executive vice president at the nonprofit Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation. \u201cWe wanted to change the conversation to show people it was for them.\u201dSome bike riders believe Citi Bikes are safer because they are slower than personal bikes, or their bright blue hue is more noticeable to drivers. But safety advocates say there is another reason: the current Citi Bike zones have good access to bike lanes. They have called for more bike lanes as part of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s Vision Zero plan to reduce traffic fatalities.Using Citi Bike offers many benefits, advocates say: It is an easy way to exercise, a more affordable travel option than using subways, buses or taxis, and provides flexibility for moving between areas that are not connected by subway lines.Still, even in neighborhoods that have Citi Bike, many people are reluctant to try it. On a recent sunny afternoon, a bike station outside the Marcy Houses in Bedford-Stuyvesant was filled with 23 bikes; not a single slot was empty.\u201cI don\u2019t use it \u2014 I don\u2019t have a credit card,\u201d Andrew O\u2019Keefe said as he stood near the station.Mr. O\u2019Keefe, 28, who works in construction, said he would consider using Citi Bike if the machines accepted cash \u2014 a common concern for those living paycheck to paycheck or who have poor credit.Rudolph Strelis, a graduate student at Pratt Institute, said he had used Citi Bike about three times this year, but he did not like the time limit. Mr. Strelis, 25, said he often saw people using the station, but he preferred to take the subway.\u201cIt\u2019s not really convenient that you have to dock the bike every 30 minutes,\u201d he said. (Extra fees apply for longer trips.)Destiny Coppedge, a 27-year-old security guard who lives at Marcy Houses, said she had never rented a Citi Bike, but her cousin used them with the $5 discounted rate. Ms. Coppedge said she had practiced riding a bike at her sister\u2019s home on Long Island, so she would eventually feel more comfortable riding in the city.\u201cI\u2019m scared to ride in the streets,\u201d Ms. Coppedge said.Advertisement"}

Trump and his family are rushing to resolve potential controversies \u2014 like shuttering foundations and terminating development deals \u2014 even as the president-elect publicly maintains that no legal conflicts exist.Even with these steps, Mr. Trump will enter the White House with a maze of financial holdings unlike those of any other president in American history. Many ethics experts still say the only way Mr. Trump can eliminate his most serious conflicts is to liquidate his company, and then put the money into a blind trust \u2014 a move Mr. Trump has so far rejected as impractical and unreasonable.And because Mr. Trump refuses to release his tax returns, the extent of his potential conflicts remains unknown.The Trumps must work out the terms of the foundation\u2019s closing. A spokeswoman for the New York attorney general\u2019s office said Saturday that any move to close the foundation required state approval, given the investigation into how it spends its money and courts donations, and the state\u2019s order that it stop fund-raising.Donald J. Trump\u2019s global business empire will create an unprecedented number of conflicts of interest for a United States president, experts say.\u201cThe Trump Foundation is still under investigation by this office and cannot legally dissolve until that investigation is complete,\u201d Amy Spitalnick, the press secretary, said.In interviews late last week, executives at the Trump Organization, advisers on the Trump transition team and members of Mr. Trump\u2019s family said they were determined to move aggressively in the remaining days before the inauguration to clear as many of these potential conflicts as possible.Among other measures:\u25a0 Eric Trump said he no longer intended to participate in any meetings \u2014 business or policy-focused \u2014 organized by his father, as the president-elect prepared to move to the White House, and would not interact with him or anyone in his administration on government matters once he was in office.\u201cI\u2019ll have no role in government,\u201d he said, describing a division of \u201cchurch and state\u201d but saying he will still talk to his father about other things.The Republican presidential nominee has an interest in more than 30 U.S. properties, roughly half of which have debt on them.While the family may be removing some of the most obvious problems, critics say Mr. Trump will still know what properties his family owns and which policy decisions will benefit them, no matter how careful he is.\u201cHe is headed in the right direction, but he has to reach the right destination, which is to divest of everything like Democratic and Republican ethics experts have said he must do,\u201d Mr. Cummings said. \u201cThe presidency is probably the most difficult job in the world. Why would you want almost every decision you make to be questioned? You have more than 111 companies operating in 18 countries.

Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, who serves on committees that are likely to have contentious hearings, can be counted on to work over many nominees.\u201cWe should know what direction this administration is headed in,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t win the election by saying they were going to hire people who want to cut Social Security and Medicare.

Called a house-for-pension plan in China, a reverse mortgage allows homeowners to tap the equity in their homes by taking out loans against it.His argument faces deep business and cultural opposition \u2014 mortgaging homes is a tough sell in a country where parents traditionally passed them on to their children \u2014 and only a few dozen people in all the country have signed up so far. But he argues that China may have little choice.\u201cChina\u2019s elderly do not have much money,\u201d said Mr. Meng, who drew much of his inspiration about the Chinese property market from a stint studying in America, \u201cbut they have valuable homes.\u201dChina is increasingly pondering tough questions as it looks to a graying future. Right now, China\u2019s 215 million elderly people account for 15 percent of the total population. By 2050, that number is expected to rise to 350 million \u2014 nearly one-quarter of the population.That has China scrambling to find a more sustainable pension system for its people. In the 1990s, the government dismantled the cradle-to-grave welfare system and borrowed money from younger workers to pay older ones. The country\u2019s pension fund will be $116 trillion in the red by 2050, according to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a top government think tank.Enter Mr. Meng.The apparatchik turned businessman, who now runs a Chinese private equity firm, argues that it is not practical for retirees to live on slow-growing pension benefits while home prices have soared over the past two decades.\u201cUnder these circumstances, participating in the house-for-pension plan can be regarded as an important option for China\u2019s elderly to improve their living conditions and live better in their later years,\u201d he said.\u201cIf the elderly in China had a lot of insurance or a high savings rate like in Japan, then they don\u2019t have to participate in the house-for-pension plan,\u201d Mr. Meng added. \u201cBut they don\u2019t have either.\u201dYu Yue, a 61-year-old widow and former factory worker in Beijing, is considering the plan. She scrapes by on $434 a month in pension payments, and her son gives her the same amount monthly.\u201cI would like to give my apartment to my child,\u201d Ms. Yu said. \u201cBut I\u2019m helpless. I need some form of safety net.\u201dInsurance companies say they were worried about the prospect of a real estate crash as well as longer life expectancy in China. China also lacks the fundamental legal framework to govern the program, said Hu Jiye, a professor who studies pension finance at the China University of Political Science and Law.\u201cMr. Meng Xiaosu is the proponent of the house-for-pension plan, and as such, he\u2019s willing to go ahead with it even if it\u2019s a money-losing venture,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the cultural environment doesn\u2019t support it. Neither does the legal environment.\u201dMr. Meng dismissed concerns about legal issues. Regarding insurance industry worries about a housing slump, he said, \u201cI told them: \u2018Stop asking me this brainless question. It doesn\u2019t exist. It has never fallen even in a year. How can it be a bubble?\u2019\u201dMr. Meng helped create the program, which is offered in Beijing, Shanghai and two other Chinese cities. As of the end of October, only 89 people had participated, according to Happy Life Insurance, an insurer founded by Mr. Meng in part to offer the policy \u2014 and, currently, only one of two insurers offering it.But the Chinese government said in July that it would extend the pilot plan to dozens of cities \u2014 Mr. Meng estimated 60 \u2014 over the next two years, and the People\u2019s Insurance Company (Group) of China, a major insurer, said it had started offering the plan in October.Mr. Meng, 67, never graduated from high school, coming of age amid the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution, and became a Red Guard, writing up posters denouncing people who were deemed political enemies. \u201cI never beat anyone,\u201d he said.In 1978, he enrolled in the prestigious Peking University, among the first group of students who passed the first higher education entrance exams held after the Cultural Revolution. He was 28. Premier Li Keqiang was his classmate.Mr. Meng eventually became the aide to Wan Li, the former vice premier of China and the pioneer of agricultural reforms.He went on to become president of the China National Real Estate Development Group Corporation, the country\u2019s largest state-owned property developer, formulating many policies that earned him the title of \u201cgodfather of real estate.\u201dIn Mr. Meng\u2019s office are dozens of framed photographs of him with other senior Chinese politicians as well as Bill Clinton, whom he calls a \u201cclose friend.\u201d (\u201cAt first, I thought about sending Hillary a note but didn\u2019t,\u201d he said the day after the presidential election. \u201cIn the end I thought, since a real estate magnate is president, we will have a bigger say. Will the U.S. real estate mogul turned president be willing to speak with China\u2019s godfather of real estate?\u201d)In 1995, Mr. Meng traveled to the United States as a visiting scholar to study economics and real estate for six months at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; the University of California, Berkeley; and Indiana University. That experience had a profound impact on Mr. Meng \u2014 and ultimately, China\u2019s middle class. It led him to believe that the Chinese people could have their version of the American dream \u2014 \u201cone house, one car,\u201d as he put it.Once home, he persuaded skeptical banks that Chinese people would pay back their mortgages. That helped introduce a housing market in which prices are controlled by the market, not the government, leading to the price appreciation that has enriched millions of Chinese households.\u201cAll these products that I introduced were from abroad, especially from the United States,\u201d he said.As home prices in China soared, Mr. Meng began studying the reverse mortgage systems in countries such as the Netherlands and the United States. In 2003, he wrote a letter to his former colleague Wen Jiabao, who had just become premier of China, telling him that Chinese retirees \u201cwill be able to live comfortably\u201d with the house-for-pension plan.That year, Beijing approved the pilot program, stoking widespread controversy. Several people blamed the government for shirking its responsibility in providing for their old age.

{"Headline": "In Donald McGahn, Donald Trump Gets a Combative White House Counsel", "Date": "2016-12-12", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In a town filled with button-down lawyers, Donald F. McGahn II has always been an iconoclast bent on shaking things up.Mr. McGahn, Donald J. Trump\u2019s pick for White House counsel, fought for years to strip away limits on big money in politics long before the Supreme Court blessed the idea, and he has relied on a bare-knuckle style to defend politicians in trouble.Still, it was an audacious move even for Mr. McGahn when he signed on in early 2015 as the lawyer for Mr. Trump\u2019s long-shot presidential bid. At the time, few other Washington insiders would get behind Mr. Trump, and some were skeptical of Mr. McGahn\u2019s decision, even openly scornful.Now, Mr. McGahn stands to become one of the most powerful, if least known, figures in Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle. The Atlantic City-born lawyer, a guitarist in a rock band who has a personality to match Mr. Trump\u2019s, will be the legal arbiter for the complicated thicket of ethical issues awaiting a president-elect who has built a vast business empire.The success of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, said Nicholas W. Allard, a longtime Washington lawyer and lobbyist who is the dean of the Brooklyn Law School, could hinge in part on Mr. McGahn\u2019s legal advice.\u201cThe challenges facing McGahn are really unique in the history of that office,\u201d Mr. Allard said.Interviews with more than a dozen associates, as well as an examination of legal filings, portray Mr. McGahn, 48, as an advocate with an impressive command of arcane election law, but also a fiercely competitive and even intimidating man eager to scrap with opponents \u2014 to \u201cduke it out,\u201d as he once said \u2014 in pressing the argument that donations of political money are a form of free speech. His Democratic opponents, however, portray him as a master of finding legal technicalities to allow election abuses to go unpunished.If his record is any guide, Mr. McGahn (pronounced Mc-GANN) will be a fierce proponent of the president\u2019s executive authority to operate independently on a wide range of issues. One key question, however, is how strongly he will push back if Mr. Trump, a man who has defied many norms, seeks to cross into murky legal terrain, a number of associates said.He may be called on to defend Mr. Trump\u2019s stances on issues like his business empire, his children\u2019s role in his administration, his moves to roll back President Obama\u2019s executive orders, his vow to bring back waterboarding or his threat to impose tariffs on companies moving abroad.President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s cabinet and top staff are shaping up to be a mix of wealthy Washington outsiders, Republican insiders and former military officers who have been critical of the Obama administration.Mr. McGahn, who declined to be interviewed for this article, appears hungry to take on his new role after steering Mr. Trump past legal minefields during the campaign en route to his improbable victory, according to friends and colleagues.He was feeling triumphant as he had lunch a few weeks ago at his blue-chip Washington law firm, Jones Day, with Benjamin Ginsberg, a colleague at the firm who was a mentor to Mr. McGahn when he was starting out in election law.\u201cHow old were you,\u201d Mr. McGahn asked his mentor, \u201cwhen you had your first winning presidential campaign?\u201d\u201cForty-nine,\u201d answered Mr. Ginsburg, who was the campaign lawyer during President George W. Bush\u2019s victory in 2000.\u201cHa! I\u2019m 48 \u2014 beat you!\u201d Mr. McGahn responded, according to Mr. Ginsberg.Mr. McGahn has little public record outside his specialty in campaign finance and election law, but colleagues predict that he will prove a quick study in the wide range of national security, domestic and regulatory issues before his office.\u201cDon is very smart, he\u2019s very combative, and he\u2019s very dogged,\u201d said Robert Bauer, a former White House counsel under Mr. Obama.Those qualities worry some Democrats who have tangled with him over the years, particularly during his time, from 2008 to 2013, as a commissioner at the Federal Election Commission.Ellen L. Weintraub, a longtime Democratic commissioner whose frequent sparring matches with Mr. McGahn became well known in the building, said she hoped he would see his new role as \u201cadvising the president to do the right thing.\u201dBut she said in an interview that she worried that \u201cif he thinks this is just another exercise in \u2018how clever can I be in devising ways around the rules,\u2019 that could have unfortunate consequences.\u201dAnn M. Ravel, another Democratic commissioner, who joined the panel after Mr. McGahn, said she found it \u201cshocking\u201d that Mr. McGahn would be the president\u2019s top legal adviser. \u201cHis record indicates that he\u2019s not particularly concerned about conflicts or ethics issues,\u201d she said.Mr. McGahn\u2019s admirers, however, chafe at the suggestion that he might become a rubber stamp for Mr. Trump.\u201cI don\u2019t see any way that Don McGahn is going to be a yes man,\u201d said Bradley A. Smith, a professor in election law at Capital University Law School in Columbus, Ohio, who has worked with Mr. McGahn on election issues. \u201cI\u2019m not sure there are too many good Republican campaign finance lawyers who could have handled Mr. Trump, and Don was able to do that.\u201dUntil now, Mr. McGahn\u2019s greatest influence came during his time on the election commission, where he made an unusual impression with hair down to his shoulders, a guitar in his office and a vocal determination to change the way the agency worked.He led the way for the Republican commissioners to effectively block numerous campaign finance inquiries that he believed were unjustified. One involved charges that Mr. Trump himself had violated fund-raising laws during a flirtation with a 2012 run for president.Democratic rivals accused Mr. McGahn of effectively shutting down enforcement at the election agency almost single-handedly. Mr. McGahn insisted he was fighting to protect the right to free speech \u2014 including the free flow of political money \u2014 against government encroachment.At one hearing at the election commission in 2011, Mr. McGahn ripped the pages out of an election regulation book and tossed the scraps in the air to demonstrate his claim that Democratic commissioners were ignoring their own rules in a case involving ads by American Crossroads, the conservative group founded by Karl Rove. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand how you can do this,\u201d he said.As an election lawyer for many years at the National Republican Congressional Committee and for conservative groups and politicians facing ethics and fund-raising issues, he earned a reputation as a man who knew every wrinkle in the law in fighting to keep his clients out of trouble.\u201cEveryone in Washington knows that if you have a problem, Don McGahn is the person to call,\u201d said David Bossie, the president of Citizens United, the conservative group that spurred the landmark Supreme Court campaign finance decision of the same name.Mr. Bossie said he had first suggested to Mr. Trump nearly two years ago that he use Mr. McGahn as his campaign lawyer if he decided to run for president. The two men had never met, but they shared an awkward family connection. Years earlier, Mr. Trump had sued Mr. McGahn\u2019s uncle, Patrick McGahn, a New Jersey lawyer who had worked for him on casino projects before they had a falling out over billings.Mr. McGahn\u2019s first big prize for Mr. Trump came 10 months ago in the Republican primary contest in New Hampshire, where Mr. McGahn went to court to fight efforts to keep Mr. Trump off the ballot on procedural grounds.Mr. Trump stayed on the ballot and went on to a resounding win \u2014 the first in a series of victories that ultimately vaulted him to the White House.At a victory party in Manchester, Mr. Trump pledged to \u201cknock the hell out of ISIS\u201d and declared that \u201cI am going to be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.\u201d Standing right behind him, silent but smiling, was Don McGahn.Kitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}

And that\u2019s good news for the planet.Over the last decade or so, most states have reduced their greenhouse gas emissions by promoting energy efficiency and renewable fuels. These trends should continue as clean energy costs continue to decline and, in some parts of the country, fall below the cost of dirtier fuels like coal.And many people expect him to walk away from President Obama\u2019s commitments under the Paris climate agreement and get rid of or weaken the E.P.A.\u2019s Clean Power Plan, which requires states to lower carbon emissions from the electricity sector. He and his appointees might also try to water down fuel economy regulations for cars and trucks, and cut clean energy tax incentives and research spending.Lawmakers, environmental groups and individuals who care about climate change ought to fight every effort to take the country backward on this issue.

{"Headline": "Small Investors Join China\u2019s Tycoons in Sending Money Abroad", "Date": "2016-12-11", "News": "Supported byAdam Dahill saw promise in the three-story brownstone on a quiet Bedford-Stuyvesant street, despite its weather-beaten facade, crumbling front steps and broken windows. But he needed nearly $1.3 million to buy it and turn it into the sort of Brooklyn dream home for which the city\u2019s lawyers and bankers pay big money.No problem. For funding, Mr. Dahill borrowed money from a new and eager group of international financiers: middle-class Chinese investors.\u201cI don\u2019t discriminate if someone wants to finance the property we developed,\u201d said the 36-year-old Mr. Dahill, who works as a mortgage broker by day. \u201cChinese? Great. American? Fine. I don\u2019t care as long as they\u2019re interested.\u201dA new generation of smartphone apps and online lending platforms in China and around the world are helping small investors leap legal and language barriers to put their money to work globally. This informal lending network \u2014 which allows Chinese investors to fund overseas projects and buyers \u2014 largely bypasses banks and other traditional sources of funds, bringing money to places as varied as a sports center in Illinois and apartment blocks in Tennessee.\u201cIt\u2019s causing a lot of resentment,\u201d said Angelo Richardson, a 45-year-old self-described entrepreneur who lives nearby. Mr. Richardson, who has lived in Brooklyn for 24 years, said his monthly rent had nearly doubled to $1,500 from $900 in just two years.These new financial platforms \u201chire really good lawyers,\u201d says Xiaochen Zhang, a co-founder of the advocacy group CrowdFund China Society. \u201cThis is still a gray area, so lawyers play a big role.\u201dZhang Xiaowen, a 36-year-old serial entrepreneur from Jiangsu Province in China, put up about $4,500 that Mr. Dahill tapped on an online lending platform. The deal promised a quick 13 percent return that \u2014 crucially, for Mr. Zhang \u2014 will be paid in American dollars. Mr. Zhang initially invested Chinese renminbi, meaning he is effectively moving part of his wealth offshore.\u201cOtherwise,\u201d Mr. Zhang said, \u201ctransferring money out of the country can be so difficult.\u201dSo far, the new investing channels have largely been unaffected. Mobile apps like Niuniu, Jimubox and Tiger Stocks allow investors to buy and sell foreign stocks from their smartphone. Online portals allow them to pool their money to buy a piece of international real estate outright, or to fund buyers abroad like Mr. Dahill in New York.Unlike other ways China\u2019s wealthy invest abroad, these new services are often priced for ordinary people. Micai, a \u201crobo-adviser\u201d app that also provides online investment services, has an investment threshold of $5,000. Wealth Migrate, a South African crowdfunding platform that was introduced in China this year, is experimenting with $100 real estate investment products.\u201cThe Chinese people have the same needs as other investors,\u201d said Scott Picken, the chief executive of Wealth Migrate. \u201cThey want wealth preservation and peace of mind.\u201dMr. Zhang, the investor who partly backed Mr. Dahill\u2019s property, made his investment through the website of Haitou360, a New York-based investment service with offices in China. Haitou360 \u2014 the Chinese portion means \u201cto throw into the sea\u201d \u2014 then aggregated investments from clients to buy loan packages from well-known American crowdfunding platforms like RealtyMogul and Patch of Land.China limits Chinese currency transfers abroad by individuals to no more than $50,000 worth a year. But Haitou360 structures its investments so that a legal entity essentially acts on behalf of individual investors, bypassing those limits.\u201cWe solve multiple problems \u2014 we manage the risk of overseas real estate investment, and we overcome the capital control limits everyone has,\u201d said Jerry Wang, the chief executive of Haitou360. The structure puts the onus on individual investors to make sure they comply with China\u2019s capital controls, he said.Through these channels, Chinese money has found its way into real estate projects far beyond a few Brooklyn brownstones: homes in New Jersey, medical facilities in Georgia, motel chains. Oversea Crowd, a Chinese private equity firm, has used crowdfunding to raise investments starting at $10,000 from Chinese clients to help fund several luxury student apartments near public universities in Georgia and North Carolina. Their latest apartment complex financed through crowdfunding will soon open near Harvard\u2019s business school.For investors, the returns depend on the period of investment \u2014 sometimes up to five years, other times, only 30 days. On average, longer-term investments have returns of 9 to 11 percent. The company collects an upfront fee, usually equal to a percentage of the investment. Investors receive returns in foreign currency, usually dollars.Before he helped fund Mr. Dahill\u2019s loan for the Brooklyn brownstone, Mr. Zhang, the Haitou360 investor, invested a small amount of money online as a test. Two months later he received a return of a little more than $6, a tiny amount but one that won his trust in online investment.He is now considering a \u201cstudy abroad\u201d investment product that would allow him to begin investing in American real estate immediately. Future returns would be directly transferred monthly to his son, now a child, to pay for tuition and living costs if he were to attend college in the United States.Some on the receiving end of that money flow are looking for ways to deal with it. In Bedford-Stuyvesant, Halsey Street is in transition. Down the street from Mr. Dahill\u2019s house, city notices and plywood affixed to brownstones denote more homes under construction. Another house nearby had a \u201cfor sale\u201d sign.Block associations are asking local homeowners to let them know before listing a home so that they can tap nearby residents to find potential buyers.\u201cWe are seeing international investors who are spending money and moving on properties here. It is changing the complexion of the community,\u201d said Tremaine Wright, the chairwoman of Community Board 3, the representative body for Bedford-Stuyvesant. She is a lifelong resident of Bedford-Stuyvesant whose parents and grandparents have also lived in the neighborhood.\u201cBed-Stuy has long been a community of people who owned their homes and resided in their homes,\u201d she added. \u201cNow it\u2019s being changed into a place where a lot of people are investing money and not making a longer-term commitment.\u201dEmily Feng reported from Beijing and Alexandra Stevenson reported from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Secret Unit Helped Brazilian Company Bribe Government Officials", "Date": "2016-12-21", "News": "Supported byAt Latin America\u2019s biggest construction company, bribing government officials around the world became so common that a division was created devoted to tracking and facilitating kickbacks.When wire transfers were inconvenient, workers in this division at Odebrecht of Brazil would organize deliveries of cash-stuffed suitcases to secret locations.It is the biggest penalty for a violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, surpassing a $800 million penalty paid by Siemens in 2008 to authorities in the United States. American officials said on Wednesday that their investigation was continuing and that individuals could also be prosecuted.Odebrecht, which built the Miami International Airport and has operations in 27 countries including the United States, China and Venezuela, has been accused of colluding with Petrobras executives and other contractors as well as Braskem to take more than a billion dollars in kickbacks from the oil company. Under the terms of the agreement with prosecutors, Odebrecht has said it will pay $2.6 billion, while Braskem has agreed to pay $957 million.The Brazilian investigation into Petrobras, called \u201cOperation Carwash,\u201d a reference to a service station that laundered money, has shaken the political establishment to the core. The authorities there have secured 112 convictions of 83 people ensnared in the investigation, including executives of Odebrecht. The scandal has left Brazil\u2019s oil industry bereft of investment during the country\u2019s worst economic crisis in decades.Odebrecht, the construction company that built Miami International Airport, settled bribery charges in a case stemming from a global investigation.Odebrecht built a secret internal group it called the Division of Structured Operations, where workers facilitated bribery payments through offshore entities as far-reaching as Antigua, prosecutors said. Sometimes, cash was delivered in packages or suitcases. The division included a separate communication system to hide its activities. Payments were made to members of Brazil\u2019s congress, officials at Brazil\u2019s two leading political parties and government officials in 12 countries including Angola, Argentina, Colombia, Panama and Mozambique.In all, the company benefited to the tune of $1.4 billion, federal prosecutors said on Wednesday.In Angola, for example, Odebrecht paid $50 million to local government officials to secure public work contracts. These projects resulted in profits of $261.7 million, prosecutors said. In Argentina, the company made $35 million in corrupt payments to intermediaries related to three infrastructure projects, knowing that some funds would be given to government officials. Its profits related to these payments were $278 million, prosecutors said.\u201cOdebrecht and Braskem used a hidden but fully functioning Odebrecht business unit \u2014 a \u2018Department of Bribery,\u2019 so to speak \u2014 that systematically paid hundreds of millions of dollars to corrupt government officials in countries on three continents,\u201d said Sung-Hee Suh, the deputy assistant attorney general of the criminal division of the Justice Department.\u201cSuch brazen wrongdoing calls for a strong response from law enforcement, and through a strong effort with our colleagues in Brazil and Switzerland, we have seen just that,\u201d Ms. Suh said.Odebrecht published a statement on Dec. 1 apologizing for its \u201cparticipation in illicit activities.\u201d William Burck, a lawyer who represents Odebrecht at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, on Wednesday said: \u201cOdebrecht has cooperated fully and will continue to do so. The company is glad to be turning the page and focusing on its future.\u201dOdebrecht\u2019s power has reached across political ideologies in Brazil and beyond the country as it made an aggressive push in Latin America and Africa.\u201cEveryone is involved,\u201d said Gil Castello Branco, founder of Contas Abertas, a transparency watchdog in Brazil. Mr. Branco added that even in the huge \u201cOperating Carwash\u201d scheme that has touched so many business executives and politicians, Odebrecht\u2019s actions stand out.\u201cOdebrecht\u2019s behavior is without precedent\u201d in Brazil, said Mr. Castello Branco. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of anything even close.\u201dFounded in 1944 by Norberto Odebrecht, the firm employs more than 250,000 people.As an indication of the favor it has been able to curry with the government, from 2007 to early 2015, more than 70 percent of the financing that Brazil\u2019s national development bank, BNDES, provided to Brazilian companies for infrastructure projects overseas went to Odebrecht, according to Contas Abertas. That was about 8.2 billion reais (or $2.5 billion based on current exchange rates) over that period of taxpayer subsidized financing, the group estimated.Braskem, which is controlled by Odebrecht, also used Odebrecht\u2019s bribery division to pay $250 million to politicians, government officials, and an official at Petrobras, according to a civil order filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday. In exchange, officials intervened on behalf of the company on several occasions. In one instance, officials influenced Petrobras to ensure more favorable pricing on its supply of a crude oil byproduct that Braskem used for its petrochemical production. In exchange for this intervention, Braskem paid more than $20 million in bribes, the S.E.C. said.Government officials were also bribed to pass a law allowing a tax credit for the purchase of that crude byproduct and other raw materials.Braskem, in a filing on Wednesday with Brazil\u2019s securities regulator, acknowledged it had completed an agreement with authorities and had \u201cconcluded the last stage of the global settlement negotiations.\u201dIt also said that under the terms of the agreement, the company \u201cwill continue to cooperate with the competent authorities and improve its governance and anti-corruption compliance practices.\u201c It noted that it will be subject to external monitoring for about three years.United States authorities said on Wednesday that Odebrecht had agreed to pay a $4.5 billion penalty but said it could only pay $2.6 billion. The final amount will be decided at a hearing on April 17.Authorities have focused on Odebrecht\u2019s bribery scheme that took place over more than 20 years, but the company became most brazen as investigators in Brazil were drawing closer in 2014. Brazilian law enforcement had just announced their Operation Carwash investigation into Petrobras, and Odebrecht employees began to destroy documents, American prosecutors said.In 2015, an Odebrecht employee arranged a meeting in Miami with an Antiguan consular official. At the meeting, the employee requested that a high-level official in Antigua refrain from sending international authorities banking documents that would show illicit payments were made on behalf of Odebrecht. The employee offered to pay $4 million for the favor, prosecutors said. In the end, 3 million euros in payments were transferred to the official.Advertisement"}

He was 95.The S\u00e3o Paulo Archdiocese confirmed his death, from pneumonia.\u201cWhere human rights are not respected, we speak out against them,\u201d Cardinal Arns said in 1972, a year before he was made a cardinal by Pope Paul VI. \u201cWhen these rights are defended, we find ourselves in support.\u201dDom Paulo, as he was known, became an enemy of the government for his stance against the torture of political prisoners. After the murder in 1975 of a journalist, Vladimir Herzog, that the government called a suicide, Cardinal Arns led an ecumenical service, along with rabbis and a Presbyterian minister, that was attended by 8,000 people.Afterward, a group of bishops issued a pastoral letter that deplored torture, the denial of prisoners\u2019 rights to a full legal defense and the suspension of habeas corpus.In support, Cardinal Arns said: \u201cThose who stain their hands with blood are damned. Thou shalt not kill.\u201dIn 1979, when Cardinal Arns went to a morgue to retrieve the body of Santo Dias da Silva, a labor leader killed by the military police, officers backed away as he waved his hand.In his sermon at Mr. Dias\u2019s funeral, Cardinal Arns said, \u201cEvery age, and sometimes every event, must have its Christ, because only thus will the fellow workers remain united and will not lose hope.\u201dCardinal Arns helped develop \u201cBrasil: Nunca Mais,\u201d or \u201cBrazil: Never More,\u201d a voluminous investigative document that chronicled the military government\u2019s torture of political opponents. Compiled largely in secret, it used military trial transcripts to build its case. It was published after the inauguration of a civilian government in 1985.The report eventually led to a Brazilian truth commission report in 2014 that identified 377 individuals responsible for human rights violations and called for their prosecution.\u201cIn the time when Brazil was living a cruel dictatorship, he always spoke and spoke loudly against torture, against violations of human rights and the lack of freedoms that were taken by the dictatorship,\u201d Maria Clara Bingemer, a theologian and Brazilian Fulbright distinguished chair in democracy and human development at the Kellogg Institute for International Studies at the University of Notre Dame, said in an interview last week. \u201cHe always intervened when he knew there were tortures.\u201dPaulo Evaristo Arns was born on Sept. 14, 1921, in Forquilhinha, Brazil. His parents, Gabriel and Helena, were German immigrants who had 12 other children; three daughters became nuns, and another son was ordained a priest. One of Cardinal Arns\u2019s sisters, Zilda Arns Neumann, was a pediatrician and humanitarian-aid worker who died in the earthquake in Haiti in 2010.Information on survivors was not immediately available.Cardinal Arns was educated by Franciscans in Brazil and ordained in 1945. He moved to Paris to study at the Sorbonne, where he earned a doctorate.After teaching at several schools, including the Catholic University of Petr\u00f3polis, Brazil, he was appointed auxiliary bishop of S\u00e3o Paulo by Pope Paul VI in 1966 and made archbishop four years later. He sold the diocese\u2019s residence to finance charitable works.Cardinal Arns believed in liberation theology, a left-leaning movement in the Roman Catholic Church focused on empowering the poor through political and civic involvement. The Vatican under Pope John Paul II opposed it, saying it was influenced by Marxism.\u201cThe Vatican was O.K. with Dom Paulo\u2019s activism against torturers, but it had difficulty with his support of liberation theology,\u201d Professor Bingemer said. \u201cBut he never stopped doing it.\u201dCardinal Arns defended his views at the Vatican in 1984 in a direct encounter with Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the future Pope Benedict XVI and the chief defender of church doctrine at the time.\u201cChristian faith,\u201d he wrote, \u201cdiscovers in the achievements of the revolution signs of the kingdom of God.\u201dThe Brazilian newspaper O Globo denounced Cardinal Arns\u2019s support of Mr. Castro, saying in an editorial that it was \u201csimply unbelievable that an archbishop should discover similarities between the kingdom of God and a totalitarian police state.\u201dCardinal Arns told reporters that he and Mr. Castro often exchanged letters, but that he was opposed to \u201cany dictatorship.\u201dCardinal Arns retired in 1998.At his recent 95th-birthday celebration in S\u00e3o Paulo, he sat on the stage of a college theater and was remembered for his devotion to the poor, the wrongly incarcerated and the tortured.\u201cWhen Brazil was plunged into darkness,\u201d Fernando Altemeyer, his former press secretary, said, \u201cDom Paulo was the star that illuminated it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "ISIS Claims Responsibility for Egypt Church Bombing and Warns of More to Come", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byAs Christians gathered in churches to pay their respects to the victims, most of them women, the Islamic State said it had sent a suicide bomber to the chapel on the grounds of St. Mark\u2019s Coptic Orthodox Cathedral, the seat of the Egyptian Orthodox Church.The Islamic State vowed to escalate its \u201cwar on polytheism\u201d \u2014 a phrase that, in the Egyptian context, is a thinly veiled reference to Christianity. The threat suggested that the group, which has been battling the Egyptian military in the Sinai Peninsula for years, planned to intensify its operations in Egypt\u2019s biggest cities.It was an embrace of sectarian violence on a scale rarely seen before in Egypt, with the Islamic State suggesting that it was prepared to single out Egyptian Christians much as it did minority Shiites in countries like Iraq and Syria.Until now, Mr. Sisi has tended to reflexively attribute most violent attacks to his enemies in the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist political movement whose leader, Mohamed Morsi, was ousted by the military in 2013. On Monday, the Interior Ministry said that exiled Brotherhood leaders had provided \u201cfinancial and logistical support\u201d for the church bombing.But the Islamic State\u2019s statement appeared to pour cold water on that assertion. Militancy experts said it was unlikely that the Brotherhood would have financed an Islamic State operation, although there is broad agreement that the man accused in the bombing, Mr. Mostafa, was arrested at a Muslim Brotherhood protest in 2014.Mr. Mostafa\u2019s family said he was jailed and released some time later, when they lost contact with him. His lawyer said he had been tortured in jail, which may have led to his radicalization.On Tuesday, images of grief-stricken parents clutching the coffins of their children were circulated on social media. The pictures provoked an outpouring of sympathy, but also a renewed wave of fury directed at Mr. Sisi for his government\u2019s failure to secure the cathedral.Egyptian Copts, who are about 10 percent of the population, have long complained of systematic discrimination. But Mr. Sisi\u2019s government, in keeping with its usual reaction to major crises this year, chose instead to turn its focus on its foreign critics.In a statement, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs denounced Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch for statements issued after Sunday\u2019s bombing, criticizing Egypt\u2019s record in protecting minority Christians.A ministry spokesman, Ahmed Abu Zeid, said the human rights groups had shown an \u201cunacceptable tolerance to terrorism.\u201dIf the Islamic State does escalate its attacks against civilians, Mr. Sisi faces some tough choices.

The deals bring much-needed upgrades, but can carry hefty price tags.Supported byBAYONNE, N.J. \u2014 Nicole Adamczyk\u2019s drinking water used to slosh through a snarl of pipes dating from the Coolidge administration \u2014 a rusty, rickety symbol of the nation\u2019s failing infrastructure.So, in 2012, this blue-collar port city cut a deal with a Wall Street investment firm to manage its municipal waterworks.Four years later, many of those crusty brown pipes have been replaced by shiny cobalt-blue ones, reflecting a broader infrastructure overhaul in Bayonne. But Ms. Adamczyk\u2019s water and sewer bill has jumped so much that she is thinking about moving out of town.\u201cMy reaction was, \u2018Oh, so I guess I\u2019m screwed now?\u2019\u201d said Ms. Adamczyk, an accountant and mother of two who received a quarterly bill for almost $500 this year. She\u2019s not alone: Another resident\u2019s bill jumped 5 percent, despite the household\u2019s having used 11 percent less water.Even as Wall Street deals like the one with Bayonne help financially desperate municipalities to make much-needed repairs, they can come with a hefty price tag \u2014 not just to pay for new pipes, but also to help the investors earn a nice return, a New York Times analysis has found. Often, these contracts guarantee a specific amount of revenue, The Times found, which can send water bills soaring.Since the financial crisis, the private equity industry has become hugely influential. Here\u2019s how it plays out in your daily life.Water rates in Bayonne have risen nearly 28 percent since Kohlberg Kravis Roberts \u2014 one of Wall Street\u2019s most storied private equity firms \u2014 teamed up with another company to manage the city\u2019s water system, the Times analysis shows. City officials also promised residents a four-year rate freeze that never materialized.In one measure of residents\u2019 distress, people are falling so far behind on their bills that the city is placing more liens against their homes, which can eventually lead to foreclosures.In the typical private equity water deal, higher rates help the firms earn returns of anywhere from 8 to 18 percent, more than what a regular for-profit water company may expect. And to accelerate their returns, two of the firms have applied a common strategy from the private equity playbook: quickly flipping their investment to another firm. This includes K.K.R., which is said to be shopping its 90 percent stake in the Bayonne venture, a partnership with the water company Suez.Rich Henning, a Suez spokesman, said that \u201cBayonne had chronically underinvested in their water and sewer infrastructure, which has certainly contributed to rate increases during the past few years.\u201d He added, \u201cWe understand that these increases create stresses for ratepayers.\u201dPresident-elect Donald J. Trump has made the privatization of public works a centerpiece of his strategy to rebuild America\u2019s airports, bridges, tunnels and roads. Members of his inner circle have sketched out a vision, including billions of dollars of tax credits for private investors willing to tackle big infrastructure projects. And Mr. Trump himself promised in his victory speech \u201cto rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none.\u201dPrivate equity firms like K.K.R. have already presented themselves as a willing partner, and Bayonne provides an important case study. Its arrangement is one of a handful of deals across the country in the last few years in which private equity firms have managed public water systems. While these deals are a small corner of private equity\u2019s sprawling interests, they represent the leading edge of the industry\u2019s profound expansion into public services.For residents, the financial trade-offs from these water deals can be painful.The Times analyzed three deals in which private equity firms have recently run a community\u2019s water or sewer services through a long-term contract. In all three places \u2014 Bayonne, and two cities in California, Rialto and Santa Paula \u2014 rates rose more quickly than in comparable towns, which included both publicly and privately run water systems. In Santa Paula, where Alinda Capital Partners controlled the sewer plant, the city more than doubled the rates. A fourth municipality, Middletown, Pa., raised its rates before striking a deal.Now, some of these cities are trying to take back their water. Missoula, Mont., wrested away its water system, which had been owned by the Carlyle Group. Apple Valley, Calif., whose waterworks were also owned by Carlyle, has filed a similar lawsuit. Santa Paula bought its sewer plant from Alinda last year.Of course, there\u2019s a reason many communities look for private partners to begin with: Their water systems are in poor shape. Budget shortfalls and political mismanagement can represent a real threat to both infrastructure and citizens. For evidence, look no further than the crisis in Flint, Mich., where the drinking water became tainted with lead.\u201cKeeping rates down may sound like the ultimate righteous good for ratepayers, but the truth is, not if you\u2019re failing to provide basic care and maintenance,\u201d said Megan Matson, a partner at Table Rock Capital, the boutique private equity firm that invested in Rialto\u2019s water and sewer system. She added that it helps for deals to \u201cprovide more obvious public benefits,\u201d noting that her firm partnered with Ullico, the nation\u2019s only labor-owned insurance and investment company.Proponents of the public-private partnerships, citing recent studies in Canada and Europe, argue that private businesses operate more efficiently than governments do and that this translates into cost savings for citizens. And private equity firms, lacking technical expertise in how to manage infrastructure, often team up with private water companies.Supporters also say that the deals require private equity to spend millions of dollars a year to fix things (money that towns may not spend on their own), and that the firms sometimes pay towns millions more up front. Bayonne, for instance, got $150 million up front from K.K.R.\u2019s team, which the city used to pay off a pile of debt.In a statement, a K.K.R. spokeswoman said, \u201cOur partnership has provided Bayonne residents with better service, modernized technology to detect leaks and conserve water, improved infrastructure and safer conditions for workers \u2014 all without a tax increase or public expenditure.\u201dIn Bayonne, a city of about 65,000 on a peninsula in the shadow of the fallen twin towers, a crucial test for its private equity deal came in July 2012. By then, Bayonne had already spent nearly a year haggling with some of K.K.R.\u2019s top negotiators.Next, city officials presented the deal to a more skeptical crowd: their own residents.Bayonne\u2019s sales pitch to its citizens illustrates the bold steps town officials can take \u2014 including making promises that are at odds with the actual terms of the deal \u2014 to attract private equity money. Private equity, in turn, can earn significant returns.At a public meeting in city hall, a lawyer for the city promised that, after an initial rate bump, there would be \u201ca rate freeze for four years,\u201d according to a meeting transcript. Bayonne\u2019s mayor, Mark Smith, later reiterated the four-year freeze in a magazine article.That promise turned out to be fleeting.The contract allowed additional rate increases after only two years. There was no four-year freeze.In fact, rates rose even more than the Bayonne contract predicted \u2014 in part because K.K.R\u2019s team had to make unexpected infrastructure upgrades, but also because residents were using less water than expected. The contract guarantees revenue to the team \u2014 more than half a billion dollars over 40 years \u2014 so water rates have jumped, in part, to make up the difference.The city said it saw the revenue requirement as a way for K.K.R.\u2019s team to earn steady returns, but not a windfall.But the Times analysis showed that Bayonne\u2019s water rates grew almost 28 percent under the deal, growth that far exceeded that of three other municipalities to which Bayonne has compared itself.(Daniel Van Abs, an associate professor at Rutgers University who specializes in water management, said that a true apples-to-apples comparison of water rates in different towns was \u201cextremely difficult\u201d because of the different factors that can influence rates, including the size of the utility, the municipality\u2019s population, droughts and infrastructure investment \u2014 or lack thereof. The Times analysis for Bayonne did not include sewer rates.)Former Bayonne officials who had promised the four-year rate freeze said in interviews that they had not meant to mislead residents. They said they had earmarked some of the K.K.R. team\u2019s $150 million up-front payment to offset rate increases in the contract\u2019s early years.But then voters ousted Mayor Smith. And once he left office, the new administration put that money elsewhere.\u201cI think we could have accomplished that four-year minimum,\u201d the former mayor said in an interview. The town\u2019s water rates, he said, are now \u201cexorbitant.\u201dBayonne officials also stress the deal\u2019s benefits, including the up-front payment that let Bayonne pay off more than $100 million in old debts. Within three months, Moody\u2019s Investor Service revised the city\u2019s debt outlook from \u201cnegative\u201d to \u201cstable\u201d for the first time in five years, and it has since upgraded the city\u2019s credit rating.K.K.R.\u2019s team contributes about $2.5 million annually to pay for repairs to water infrastructure, plus $500,000 to the city itself. K.K.R. and Suez said they have upgraded their safety equipment and replaced inoperable hydrants around town.They also installed sophisticated water meters that can detect leaks in people\u2019s homes, and sent nearly 2,000 letters to customers warning when such leaks occurred. As such, use has declined, according to Mr. Henning, who said Suez had received \u201cmany notes of thanks\u201d for the warnings.But more-sensitive meters could lead to higher bills for some residents whose water use wasn\u2019t fully captured in the past. When negotiating the deal, K.K.R. called this process \u201cmeter uplift,\u201d according to emails obtained through records requests.\u201cWe gave away too much,\u201d said Gary La Pelusa Sr., a city councilman and former commissioner of Bayonne\u2019s utilities authority, which approved the deal over his objections.Bayonne originally promised residents that the city\u2019s utilities authority would oversee K.K.R. and Suez. But the City Council recently decided to shutter the agency and handle the oversight itself.Stephen Gallo, who headed that authority when the deal was struck, still believes that it benefits Bayonne. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to watch them, you\u2019ve got to keep an eye on things,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know who\u2019s doing that now.\u201dIn interviews with The Times, more than a dozen Bayonne residents, including Ms. Adamczyk, expressed dismay over the rate increases. One reason is that people who fall behind on payments face long-term risks: Unpaid water and sewer bills can be sold to investors who try to collect on that debt, a common practice across the country. Failure to pay can ultimately lead to foreclosure.In 2012, the year Bayonne struck its deal, water bill delinquencies led to 200 government liens against local properties, tax records show. That figure more than tripled the next year, the first full year under K.K.R.\u2019s team. In 2015, the most recent year with data available, the number remained elevated, at 465.The city publishes its lien notices in the local newspaper and residents receive mailed delinquency letters.Still, when a reporter asked one Bayonne resident, Carlos Jimenez, about a water and sewer bill lien that had been listed against his property, he expressed surprise, saying he wasn\u2019t aware of it. \u201cI didn\u2019t know this could happen,\u201d Mr. Jimenez said. \u201cIt\u2019s a different ballgame.\u201dOne of the few things Republicans and Democrats can agree on is that the nation faces an infrastructure crisis.For years, the Obama administration has been cheerleading public-private partnerships. In a statement, the White House said it backed them \u201cwhen they are well structured, include strong labor standards, and when there is confidence that taxpayers are getting a good deal.\u201dDuring the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump\u2019s team outlined a new plan to incentivize private investors to take on large infrastructure projects.Wall Street has responded to the call to action. There are now 84 active financial infrastructure funds, according to Pitchbook, a private financial data platform, up 25 percent in just three years. Some belong to big banks like Goldman Sachs, but many are run by private equity firms.\u201cAcross our country, we need solutions for infrastructure deficiencies,\u201d said James Maloney, a spokesman for the American Investment Council, the private equity trade group. \u201cPrivate equity serves as one of these solutions.\u201dSome critics are wary of expanding private investment in public infrastructure. Although cities may get cash up front in these deals, \u201cthere is no \u2018free\u2019 money\u201d in public-private partnerships, says a 2008 Government Accountability Office report. Using roads as an example, the report observed \u201cit is likely\u201d that tolls will increase more on a privately operated highway than one run by the government.Ms. Matson, of Table Rock, who has attended White House meetings on infrastructure, has tried to dispel concerns about these deals. Table Rock is part of a team that finances and manages the water system in Rialto, Calif., a deal that provided the city about $41 million to improve the water and wastewater infrastructure, she said.Rialto residents have seen their water rates increase about 68 percent since the deal, according to the Times analysis, more than any other comparable city. But Table Rock said rates were artificially low after the city had declined to raise them for about a decade, giving it the lowest rates among those towns. And unlike in most other deals, Rialto residents had a say in the increases and ultimately approved them in a public vote, as required under state law. This year\u2019s rate increase was delayed.When the deal closed in 2012, all the public water utility employees kept their jobs. Everyone has since received raises. And Table Rock, like its partner Ullico, has committed to all 30 years of the arrangement.\u201cWe don\u2019t do flips, we invest for life,\u201d Ms. Matson said, meaning that Table Rock doesn\u2019t seek quick profits by unloading its investments. She also said that Table Rock declined to make deals that provided big up-front payments to towns without a sufficient commitment to infrastructure repairs. \u201cThose deals give the rest of us a bad name,\u201d she said.In an upscale Washington, D.C., restaurant in 2012, an executive from the Carlyle Group, one of the world\u2019s largest private equity firms, put his arm around the mayor of Missoula, Mont.\u201cMayor,\u201d the executive said, \u201care you ready to buy a water system?\u201dThree years later, the comments by the executive, Robert Dove, were recounted from a witness stand in the Missoula County Courthouse. The city was suing Carlyle, which ultimately refused to sell to Missoula, to gain control of its water system.Missoula is one of several places in recent years that have tried getting back their water systems from a private company. But after waging costly battles, the towns cannot always guarantee the same services at lower rates.At the time of that dinner in Washington, Missoula was the only city in Montana that did not own its water system \u2014 and John Engen, Missoula\u2019s mayor, wanted to change that. So, months before, he had supported Carlyle\u2019s purchase of the regional water company (Park Water) that owned Missoula\u2019s local system (Mountain Water), believing that Carlyle would then sell Mountain Water back to his town.But the mayor\u2019s plans derailed.In October 2013, Missoula made an informal offer to buy its local system. Carlyle declined. Missoula made a formal offer. Carlyle declined again.Missoula then sued, and it won. But the court decided the system was worth $88.6 million, substantially more than what the city had offered. On top of that, the city must spend millions of dollars on legal and other fees and must also pay some of its opponents\u2019 costs, according to court records.Those costs included lawyers\u2019 fees, limo services and dinners at some of Missoula\u2019s finest restaurants. They also included at least one order of boneless chicken wings at Hooters, and one bottle of Metamucil.In a statement, a Carlyle spokesman said that the firm had considered the city\u2019s offers in good faith. \u201cThe city offered many millions less than the company was worth, and an independent panel agreed,\u201d the spokesman said.He also said that under Carlyle\u2019s watch, \u201ccapital expenditures more than doubled, leakage was reduced by 19 percent, water quality was excellent and employment was stable.\u201dAnd under Missoula\u2019s watch, water rates may rise anyway. Further costly repairs are still needed, for one thing.For Carlyle, the deal was a financial success. The firm sold Park Water in January to another private company for $327 million, more than double what Carlyle had paid.Alinda, which specializes in infrastructure investing, had teamed up with a private water recycling company to finance, design, build and operate the plant after the city awarded them the contract in 2008. The new facility, Alinda noted, replaced an old plant owned by Santa Paula that had been violating state environmental regulations, saving the city from paying fines.But after years of raising sewer rates, partly to pay \u201cservice fees\u201d to Alinda, Santa Paula\u2019s thinking changed: It would be better for Santa Paula to issue its own debt to purchase the plant than to saddle citizens with annual rate increases. Now the town \u2014 at the urging of its city manager, Jaime Fontes, and several council members, including Ginger Gherardi \u2014 has started issuing rebates to citizens.Still, there will be bumps along the road. After all, cities like Missoula and Santa Paula are now responsible for running an important, and occasionally messy, public service.Soon after Santa Paula regained control of its sewer plant, an equipment failure let partly treated wastewater pour from the plant. The discharge turned a pond green and flowed onto a nearby organic farm.And wastewater, Mr. Fontes said, is \u201cnot the kind of organic you want.\u201dRachel Abrams contributed reporting from Los Angeles.

The only fine in that 2013 case came from federal prosecutors in Sacramento, who took $2 billion of the penalty and deposited it into a fund at the United States Treasury. The next chunk, roughly $7 billion, went a range of federal and state authorities. The Justice Department earmarked $4 billion to help struggling homeowners in hard-hit areas like Detroit.

{"Headline": "Google Says It Will Run Entirely on Renewable Energy in 2017", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byMINCO, Okla. \u2014 Last year, Google consumed as much energy as the city of San Francisco. Next year, it said, all of that energy will come from wind farms and solar panels.The online giant said on Tuesday that all of its data centers around the world will be entirely powered with renewable energy sources sometime next year.This is not to say that Google computers will consume nothing but wind and solar power. Like almost any company, Google gets power from a power company, which operates an energy grid typically supplied by a number of sources, including hydroelectric dams, natural gas, coal and wind power.What Google has done over the last decade, with relatively little fanfare, is participate in a number of large-scale deals with renewable producers, typically guaranteeing to buy the energy they produce with their wind turbines and solar cells. With those guarantees, wind companies can obtain bank financing to build more turbines.The power created by the renewables is plugged into the utility grid, so that Google\u2019s usage presents no net consumption of fossil fuels and the pool of electricity gets a relatively larger share of renewable sources.\u201cWe are the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the world,\u201d said Joe Kava, Google\u2019s senior vice president of technical infrastructure. \u201cIt\u2019s good for the economy, good for business and good for our shareholders.\u201dUnlike carbon-based power, Mr. Kava said, wind supply prices do not fluctuate, enabling Google to plan better. In addition, the more renewable energy it buys, the cheaper those sources get. In some places, like Chile, Google said, renewables have at times become cheaper than fossil fuels.Whether Google is the largest buyer of renewables would be difficult to verify, as many industries do not release data on how much energy they consume. There is no doubt, however, that Google\u2019s large computer complexes, along with similar global operations by Amazon and Microsoft, are among the world\u2019s fastest-growing new consumers of electricity.Google hopes that success in working with large wind farms, like the 50,000-acre facility in Minco, Okla., which supplies Google\u2019s large data center in Pryor, Okla., will spur development of the industry. NextEra Energy, which owns the wind farm, has about 115 wind farms in the United States and Canada.About 25 percent of United States electricity goes to businesses, and companies like Google are now about 2 percentage points of that. Dominion Virginia Power, located in a state with perhaps the world\u2019s largest concentration of data centers, last year had a demand increase from those customers of 9 percent, while overall demand was nearly flat, according to Dominion.Google operates eight different businesses, including internet search engines, YouTube and Gmail, each of which has over 1 billion customers. They run on a global network of 13 large-scale data centers, each one a complex of many buildings containing hundreds of thousands of computers.The 5.7 terawatt-hours of electricity Google consumed in 2015 \u201cis equal to the output of two 500 megawatt coal plants,\u201d said Jonathan Koomey, a lecturer in the school of earth, energy and environmental sciences at Stanford. That is enough for two 140,000-person towns. \u201cFor one company to be doing this is a very big deal. It means other companies of a similar scale will feel pressure to move.\u201dIt moves the needle on costs to have a big consumer, Mr. Koomey added, since a larger market tends to allow for economies of scale and more innovation. \u201cEvery time you double production, you reduce the cost of solar by about 20 percent. Wind goes down 10 to 12 percent,\u201d he said.Facebook has entered into similar deals with wind producers. Last week, Amazon reiterated its long-term commitment to power its machines entirely with renewable energy, though for 2016 it expects to be above about 40 percent of its goal. It has announced five more solar projects.Microsoft says it has been 100 percent carbon neutral since 2014, but much of this comes from the purchase of carbon offsets, which are investments in things like tree planting or renewables projects meant to compensate for the fossil fuels a company consumes. The company hopes to have half of its electric power supplied from wind, solar and hydroelectric sources by 2018. Its data centers currently use about 3.3 million megawatt-hours of power a year.Critics note that while Google might be adding wind and solar to the world\u2019s power grid, overall it is still dependent on fossil fuels, since sun and wind power are intermittent, while demand for things like YouTube cat videos is continual.\u201cIn my mind it\u2019s a P.R. gimmick,\u201d said Chris Warren, vice president of communications at the Institute for Energy Research, a think tank in Washington supported largely by donations from individuals and companies in the fossil fuel industry. \u201cIf they think they can actually support themselves with wind and solar panels, they should connect them directly to their data centers.\u201dNext year\u2019s goal will be 95 percent accomplished with wind turbines around the world, Mr. Kava said, and Google\u2019s support for the industry could keep prices dropping, particularly relative to things like coal. \u201cWe\u2019re technology-agnostic, but we\u2019re not price-agnostic,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article gave an outdated title for Jonathan Koomey at Stanford.

They are favored to beat archrival Army on Saturday for the 15th consecutive year. And two days before Christmas, Navy will end its season by playing Louisiana Tech in the Lockheed Martin Armed Forces Bowl, which has a payout of $600,000 per team.This season is not an anomaly. The United States Naval Academy may not be Alabama or Michigan, but it plays a serious brand of Division I football. Last year, the Blue and Gold went 11-2, soundly defeating the University of Pittsburgh in the Military Bowl ($1 million payout for each team). In 2014, the team was 8-5, including a one-point victory over San Diego State in the Poinsettia Bowl ($750,000 payout). Its 2013 record was 9-4, with a season-ending win ... well, you get the picture. The last time Navy had a losing season was 2011.But how does Navy do it? Aren\u2019t there height and weight restrictions that would limit the Midshipmen\u2019s ability to recruit the kind of athletes you need to succeed in Division I football? (There are.) Isn\u2019t the federal government stingy in giving tax dollars to the military academies for athletics? (It is.) Aren\u2019t the academies, charged with training the nation\u2019s military leadership, supposed to maintain their admissions and academic standards even if it means passing on football players? (Yep.) And aren\u2019t Naval Academy graduates required to put in five years of military service after graduation, which would seem to preclude attracting athletes with pro potential? (Yes again.)\u201cFootball is a polite and unarmed version of warfare, played as though there\u2019s no second place.\u201d He added: \u201cYeah, we\u2019re a small school, our players are usually smaller, too. But we\u2019re very physical, very disciplined and approach every game with the urgency required to win a battle.\u201dThere is some merit to both rationales, but I\u2019d also like to suggest a third possibility: Navy\u2019s gaming the system.By the late 1960s, NAPS had opened its doors to civilians. This was partly a diversity effort, but it was also a way to get in the children of alumni or politicians who didn\u2019t have the grades or SAT scores to be admitted into the Naval Academy directly from high school. Once in NAPS, which is tuition-free, students were essentially guaranteed a spot in the Naval Academy the next year. According to a Naval Academy spokesman, Cmdr. David McKinney, the prep school costs taxpayers around $14 million a year.In the 1980s, Navy noticed that the Air Force Academy, which was regularly trouncing it in football, was placing recruited athletes in its prep school. Indeed, in 2003, Fisher DeBerry, the longtime coach of the Falcons, told The Colorado Springs Gazette that the prep school \u201chas had a major impact on the success of our football team.\u201dEager to turn the tide against its rival, Navy began to copy DeBerry\u2019s methods. Sure enough, NAPS is now a means by which Navy launders underqualified athletes into the Naval Academy.Jim Kenney, a retired Navy captain who was the commanding officer of the Navy prep school from 1978-82, recalled that in his era maybe four football players had been enrolled. \u201cToday,\u201d he said, \u201cit is dominated by athletes.\u201dIn addition to a free education, the Navy gives NAPS students $1,000 a month.Ordinarily, this would be a violation of N.C.A.A. rules. Because NAPS students are being paid for being in the military, the N.C.A.A. has granted a waiver allowing the stipend. (The same is true at the Air Force and Army prep schools.)What was NAPS like for the athletes? The athletics were intense, and the academics none too stressful, recalled Peter Banos, who played basketball there in 2008. \u201cThere was all sorts of tutoring,\u201d he said, \u201cbut really, it was like another year of high school.\u201dBanos added: \u201cWe had cars, we could visit friends, and we were flush with cash. It was high school kids getting paid.\u201d And if, after a year at NAPS, a student decided not to go the academy, the Navy didn\u2019t ask for its money back. Banos left the Naval Academy after his freshman year.The Naval Academy said that many NAPS athletes go on to succeed at the academy and in the Navy. Three former Navy football players from the class of 1998, all of whom went through NAPS, are in important command posts seeking terrorists.Let\u2019s dwell on this for a second. Imagine if some Ohio State boosters paid to send recruited athletes to a private prep school for a year before they went to the university. It would be an out-and-out scandal \u2014 exactly the kind of booster bribery the N.C.A.A. wants to stamp out. Yet, once again, the military academies have been given a waiver by the association.Those height and weight restrictions I mentioned earlier? They are waived for athletes \u2014 at least until their eligibility is used up. At that point, those 280 pounds that made a Navy lineman so valuable to the team become a huge liability. They are suddenly under tremendous pressure to lose 50, 60, 70 pounds, depending on their height. And if they don\u2019t \u2014 or simply can\u2019t \u2014 their careers suffer, and sometimes end prematurely.As for that required five years of military service, there once was a time when even the best Navy athletes had to put in time after graduation before going on to a professional career. Roger Staubach, who won the Heisman Trophy as a junior in 1963, didn\u2019t join the Dallas Cowboys until 1969. His Navy tour included a year in Vietnam.Recently, athletes good enough to become professionals haven\u2019t had to put in five years of military service. In May, the secretary of the Navy granted waivers to four Navy athletes, allowing them to play while serving in the Reserve. They included Keenan Reynolds, last season\u2019s quarterback, who is now with the Baltimore Ravens, and Joe Cardona, who is the long snapper for the New England Patriots.And it doesn\u2019t just finance the athletic department. It runs it. The N.A.A.A. employs and pays the coaches. (Navy\u2019s football coach, Ken Niumatalolo, makes $1.6 million.) It manages the stadium. It negotiates the media contracts. And it rustles up sponsors. In all, Navy\u2019s athletic budget is over $40 million, in the same range as the budgets at Hawaii, Boise State and New Mexico.Are the compromises Navy makes to remain competitive in big-time college football any worse than other Division I schools? Not really. But that\u2019s not the point.The military academies do something critical for our nation: They \u201ctrain and educate junior officers in the Navy and Marine Corps,\u201d said Barry Relinger, a Naval Academy alumnus. \u201cThey should be dedicated to that purpose and not trying to achieve greatness of Division I sports.\u201dNo one is saying sports shouldn\u2019t matter at the Naval Academy. The Navy believes that sports can build character and imbue leadership qualities that are important for officers. I\u2019m not going to disagree.But to its critics, the gamesmanship required for the Naval Academy to be able to play football competitively with the likes of Notre Dame has hurt its ability to turn out the best officers possible.\u201cI think competition is very important,\u201d said David Tuma, an alumnus who has long been critical of Navy athletics. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to be in Division I to stir the competitive spirit.\u201dOn Saturday afternoon, the annual Army-Navy game will be a hard-fought, patriotic spectacle. It will be fun to watch. Would we feel any different about it if the two schools didn\u2019t park athletes in their prep schools? If the linemen weighed 230 instead of 280? If they were in Division III instead of Division I? I doubt it.If only the Navy believed that.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of consecutive years Navy will have beaten Army if Navy wins Saturday. It is 15, not 14. The article also misstated Roger Staubach\u2019s year at Navy when he won the Heisman Trophy. It was his junior year, not his senior year.Advertisement"}

A federal grand jury is scrutinizing whether Mr. de Blasio or his aides took actions to benefit donors in exchange for contributions to his campaign or to a nonprofit group created to support his agenda.\u201cWe did things the right way and by the law,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cI\u2019m very comfortable with it because I know we did things the right way.\u201dLater in the day, Mr. de Blasio held a news conference to discuss an initiative to donate 5,000 tablets with Wi-Fi to families in public housing in the Bronx.But on Friday, after talking about the cold weather and public housing and the internet, he refused to go further afield when Marcia Kramer of WCBS-TV asked about the grand juries.\u201cWe\u2019re doing this topic right now, Marcia,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said.Another reporter asked if he was the target of any grand jury action.\u201cGuys, you can ask all you want but that\u2019s for another setting,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said.

For many people without bank accounts, the bills, which have long been the country\u2019s highest-denomination note, are their primary means of saving money.\u201cLike all Venezuelans, I\u2019m trying to get this problem resolved,\u201d said Maritza Sosa, 65, a retiree who had waited for hours at a bank here to exchange 2,000 bol\u00edvars in 100-bol\u00edvar bills.The problem has long been that the notes are nearly worthless.That news came as a relief to many Venezuelans who had become accustomed to carrying around small bags even for the most basic transactions. Lunch in Caracas, for example, could cost 10,000 bol\u00edvars, requiring carrying 100 bills that might be counted in machines at the register.But on Sunday Mr. Maduro made a second announcement: The 100-bol\u00edvar notes would be taken out of circulation almost immediately as a move to combat organized crime groups that he said were hoarding them. The president also announced that he would temporarily close the border with Colombia, where he said the bills were being traded on the black market for dollars.On Friday, Venezuelan news media said the lines had resulted in chaotic scenes in several cities in the country, including El Callao and Puerto La Cruz, where there had been protests and outbreaks of looting.There were also confused scenes at banks like the Banesco branch in the El Hatillo neighborhood here. On Thursday, it had been flooded by hundreds of people demanding to make deposits. On Friday, the bank, which was out of money to make exchanges, was nearly empty. Mario Rafael Pi\u00f1a, a teller, said the bank had no idea when it would receive the higher-denomination bills.Maria Eugenia Cepeda, 52, a real estate agent, feared she would soon run out of money for food if she could not get new currency. A.T.M.s throughout the neighborhood were dispensing only 100 bol\u00edvar notes, she said, and the tellers had told her they did not have any money available to cash a smaller check for her.El\u00edas Matta, an opposition congressman who has sat on finance committees, criticized the government\u2019s moves for coming at the holiday season, when Venezuelans are making Christmas purchases. He estimates that about 30 percent of Venezuelans rely on cash because they have no bank accounts. \u201cNo one is prepared, not the banks, not the government, not the people,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we are paying the consequences for this nonsense.\u201dOn Friday, Jorge Alvez, 24, a motorcycle taxi driver, waited outside a bank with 6,100 bol\u00edvars in 100-bol\u00edvar notes, his earnings from clients over recent days when he says he accepted the bills \u201cbecause I am considerate.\u201dHe had spent recent days shopping at stores that would accept them, trying to change what he could into food.What would he do with the rest?\u201cMaybe throw them in the trash,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cOr save them as a souvenir.\u201dAna Vanessa Herrero reported from Caracas, and Nicholas Casey from New York.

{"Headline": "Deutsche Bank Flew and Fell. Some Paid a High Price.", "Date": "2016-12-30", "News": "Supported byIn 2005, Deutsche Bank, then a powerhouse in the selling of risky derivatives on a global scale, was minting money.To mark the moment, the bank\u2019s profit engine \u2014 its global markets division \u2014 commissioned a book about itself. The remembrance would celebrate how Deutsche Bank, once a sleepy lender to German car companies, had transformed itself in just 10 years into a force in financial engineering, selling interest-rate swaps, credit derivatives and opaque tax-slashing investment vehicles to the world\u2019s wealthy elite.In the view of one senior executive, it all came down to masterly salesmanship by a single man, Anshu Jain, the chief promoter of the bank\u2019s hottest product: risk.\u201cThe size just kept mounting and mounting,\u201d this person marveled in a passage in the book, referring to the growing demand for some of Deutsche\u2019s raciest fare. And it was Mr. Jain, the bank\u2019s eventual leader, who \u201cdramatically accelerated that delivery of complex structures to the broader client base.\u201dThe fine was one of the last \u2014 and among the stiffest \u2014 penalties imposed upon global investment banks by the Obama administration for their role in the financial crisis. And it was also a fitting coda to a turbulent 21-year run by the trading and banking unit at Deutsche that was inspired by three derivative specialists who had been poached from Wall Street years earlier.In addition to Mr. Jain, they included Edson Mitchell, a charismatic builder of businesses at Merrill Lynch who, in 1995, was given a mandate by Deutsche to create a world-class investment bank in London and spare no expense in doing so.Mr. Mitchell recruited two colleagues from Merrill to help him in his task. William S. Broeksmit, a derivatives trader with a risk manager\u2019s nose for spotting financial dangers, was one. And Mr. Jain, then just coming into his own as a purveyor of the exotic to hedge funds around the world, joined him.Today, two of these three men are dead.Mr. Mitchell died in a plane crash in 2000 at age 47. Mr. Broeksmit committed suicide in 2014 at 58.As for the 53-year-old Mr. Jain, his carefully crafted plan to finish what his mentor, Mr. Mitchell, started at Deutsche Bank has ended in disappointment.In the years since the financial crisis, many investment banks have had to pay significant amounts to atone for their various sins. And while the sum of Deutsche\u2019s fines is in the middle of the pack, the bank has been drawn into some of finance\u2019s furthest frontiers when it comes to the pursuit of profit.Deutsche has been a primary offender in two of the biggest banking scandals of the past decade: promoting toxic mortgages to unwitting investors and manipulating for profit the main lending rate for banks in London. In the process, it has agreed to pay over $9 billion in fines and consumer relief. The bank has sold tax-reduction products to hedge funds, and is alleged to have helped Russian investors illegally move money overseas.This is also a bank that marketed complex derivatives to Europe\u2019s sickliest bank, Monte dei Paschi in Italy. And it is one of the largest lenders to Donald J. Trump, having extended roughly $300 million in loans to the president-elect\u2019s businesses.Analysts calculate that of the 20 billion euros in profits that Deutsche\u2019s trading and banking unit accumulated since 1995, as much as 15 billion euros will ultimately be returned to regulators via fines and penalties. Of course, not all of this lands in the lap of Mr. Mitchell \u2014 and more recently, Mr. Jain.The investment bank they created remains a power in bond and foreign currency trading worldwide. And from the beginning, it was overseen by a strong-willed German board that knew well the risks and rewards that came with such a business.It is also the case that when Mr. Jain became co-chief executive of Deutsche in 2012, one of his first priorities was lowering the bank\u2019s risk, which he did by unloading opaque, hard-to-trade assets. In spring 2015, Mr. Jain put in place his own plan for reforming the bank, which his C.E.O. successor, John M. Cryan, has not entirely abandoned.That said, Mr. Cryan has made it clear that his Deutsche Bank will be markedly different from Mr. Jain\u2019s. Since taking over last year, Mr. Cryan has preached simplicity, less risk, better internal controls and reduced reliance on derivatives. As for the investment bank he inherited from Mr. Jain, he has said that he is committed to it but that it will be a very different institution under him.Through spokesmen, Mr. Jain and Deutsche Bank declined to comment.Following Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Deutsche\u2019s stock has been on a tear, up over 30 percent on the hope that the combination of a banking-friendly president and a more cautious leadership under Mr. Cryan will help the bank chart a new path.When an investment bank trips up in spectacular fashion, human misfortune is often a consequence. That could mean a cashiered chief executive seeing his career and reputation ruined. Or a rogue trader who loses billions of dollars and ends up in prison.But there have been few instances in which the personal toll surrounding a bank\u2019s rise and fall has been as profound as this one.By December 2000, Mr. Mitchell seemed to have accomplished the impossible. In just five years, he had hired thousands of traders and bankers from firms all over Wall Street (an effort that got a boost by the acquisition of Bankers Trust in 1999), forging not just a strong culture but also a highly profitable business.While there were numerous deposit-driven banks in Europe that made a play for American investment banking business in the 1980s and 1990s, none did it with the zeal of Deutsche Bank under Mr. Mitchell and later Mr. Jain.Even before he moved to London, Mr. Mitchell had developed a reputation for being one of Wall Street\u2019s premier recruiters, with a pied-piper-like ability to attract, and keep, the best traders and bankers around. He had a special methodology in his choosing, inclining toward those who came from big families and played team sports in college, because he felt that these traits would give him \u201cathletes\u201d capable of working well together in the large competitive grouping of a trading floor.At Merrill, Mr. Mitchell, Mr. Jain and Mr. Broeksmit had used their expertise in derivatives and swaps to carve out market share from established players like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. As Mr. Broeksmit would recount in an unpublished interview with a reporter for Bloomberg News, the strategy worked because of Mr. Jain\u2019s skill, while at Merrill, in enticing his hedge-fund clients into volatile yet profitable investments \u2014 such as bond futures, swaps and other derivatives.The plan was to use a similar strategy in London with Deutsche Bank.\u201cI remember Edson called me up and said, \u2018I have just been given the keys to the kingdom at Deutsche Bank \u2014 we can do whatever we want,\u2019\u201d recalled Michael G. Philipp, one of the first Merrill executives to follow Mr. Mitchell to Deutsche; \u201c2,500 people in 18 months \u2014 it has never been done since.\u201dMr. Mitchell\u2019s untimely death in 2000 was a devastating blow to the bank and more so to his many friends and followers. But it did not alter the bank\u2019s mission, the mantle of which was eventually taken on by Mr. Jain.By the time of the financial crisis, 90 percent of the bank\u2019s profits would come from the London-based global market\u2019s division \u2014 fueled mostly by derivatives-driven trading bets and its dominant positions as a foreign currency trader.All that changed in late 2008.With one investment bank after another going bust, Deutsche\u2019s board had become increasingly concerned as to the bank\u2019s derivatives holdings, according to documents reviewed by The Times. In October 2008 the bank\u2019s derivatives exposure, net of cash collateral, was 181 billion euros, these documents show, a sizable sum given its equity cushion of just 30 billion euros.Starting in 2007, Mr. Jain had already taken steps to materially reduce Deutsche\u2019s risk profile. However, he and his team pushed back hard against the view that the investment bank\u2019s power should be significantly curtailed.\u201cThis underlines the paradox of D.B.,\u201d read a briefing paper for Mr. Jain prepared in advance of the bank\u2019s general executive committee meeting in mid-December 2008. \u201cHowever much some at the G.E.C. would like to see D.B. return to its roots as a continental commercial bank, it is clear that international sales and trading will represent the bulk of value creation at D.B.\u201dSales and trading would also become the focus for regulators in Germany, London and the United States who, in the wake of the crisis, cracked down severely. The $7.2 billion penalty announced in December represents, in effect, the final bill to be paid toward the Mitchell and Jain plan of paying bankers outsize sums to take outsize risks in pursuit of outsize profits.Of course, it was an approach that was endorsed by the leadership in Frankfurt, not least Josef Ackermann, Deutsche\u2019s chief from 2002 to 2012, who encouraged these bold gambits.As the fines and scandals mounted, though, especially the rigging scheme involving a key interest rate known as the London Interbank Offered Rate \u2014 in which Deutsche played a central role \u2014 even bankers who had been along for the ride wondered if it had been worth it. \u201cShame on what is happening to DBK,\u201d wrote Martin Loat, a retired Deutsche Bank executive, to Mr. Broeksmit in December 2013, using the common shorthand of Deutsche\u2019s stock ticker.\u201cI was negative on big banks and very vocal to Joe on bonuses. The then-1.6 trillion euro balance sheet on 50 billion euros of equity was plain stupid. I also disliked credit derivatives with a passion. But Libor and other thefts \u2014 that even ultra-cynic Martin never believed could happen,\u201d he wrote, referring to himself.For many senior bankers, eye-watering losses and regulatory crackdowns are part of the cold calculation of a Wall Street career that can, quite suddenly, veer from triumph to ignominy.Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Jain were such men \u2014 exceedingly confident risk takers with thick public skins. Bill Broeksmit, a behind-the-scenes technician with an acute sense of the rights and wrongs in finance, was not.And that is why his sad end carries a larger resonance as the business model that his two close colleagues put in place ultimately failed the institution and the many who had devoted their lives to it. He was, in many ways, the connective tissue linking Mr. Mitchell to his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Mr. Jain in their management of the bank.Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Broeksmit were close friends, working together for more than a decade at Merrill and bonding over a shared love of Maine, where they decamped each summer. After Mr. Mitchell\u2019s death, Mr. Broeksmit would form a bond with Mr. Jain, offering advice to him, via official and unofficial channels, as to Deutsche\u2019s fluctuating risk profile.Within Deutsche, Mr. Broeksmit was seen to be Mr. Jain\u2019s eyes and ears when it came to tracking various trading positions and risk exposures.Mr. Broeksmit was always an ardent advocate for Mr. Jain. He was the Deutsche Bank executive who cited Mr. Jain\u2019s salesmanship abilities as a formative contributor to the bank\u2019s early success in the book that celebrated the unit\u2019s 10-year anniversary.Mr. Broeksmit had originally been persuaded by Mr. Mitchell to move to London with the first wave of Merrill Lynch defectors in 1995 and 1996. As the brains behind Mr. Mitchell\u2019s ambition for Deutsche to become a leading derivatives bank, he was what financial hands call a plumber \u2014 an expert in the piping and flow of money, largely unknown beyond the trading floor.Bookish, though not without a touch of the trader\u2019s swagger, Mr. Broeksmit was also a man of loyalties, always quick to share the burdens of a friend in need. So when Mr. Jain asked him to take on a larger risk role at Deutsche in 2007, he said yes, even though he had been enjoying his more relaxed life as private consultant after stepping down as a full-time executive.After a time, though, the drumbeat of investigations began to wear on him.There was Deutsche\u2019s role in the rate-rigging scandal, for which it paid $2.5 billion, the highest sum of the roughly $9 billion paid by major investment banks.In the days after Mr. Broeksmit\u2019s death in early 2014, Mr. Jain ordered up a report, with help from outside lawyers, to determine whether the suicide had been work-related. Mr. Broeksmit\u2019s ties, direct or indirect, to Deutsche\u2019s many regulatory woes were examined in detail. In September of that year, the report concluded that there was \u201cnothing that shows a direct link between Bill\u2019s death and his work at Deutsche Bank.\u201dThe executives who produced the report said that he was \u201cnot unhappy\u201d during his last days at the bank in 2013. He had officially stepped down that summer, although, in his usual style, he was not cutting ties completely, staying on as a director at Deutsche\u2019s New York Bank. \u201cHad my retirement luncheon hosted by Anshu last week,\u201d Mr. Broeksmit wrote to a friend that November. \u201cIt\u2019s the third time I have retired!\u201dThe extent to which Deutsche\u2019s legal woes played a role in Mr. Broeksmit\u2019s untimely death remains a mystery.In mid-2013, with investigations into Deutsche\u2019s conduct mounting, Mr. Broeksmit did pay a visit to a psychiatrist in London that became part of the coroner\u2019s examination into his death. According to the doctor\u2019s diagnosis, Mr. Broeksmit had \u201cimagined being investigated, being prosecuted, losing his wealth and his reputation.\u201d But, in the same letter, the doctor said his patient recognized that these thoughts were not a \u201crealistic possibility,\u201d even if they caused him sleeplessness and anxiety.There are no records of Mr. Broeksmit paying further visits to a psychiatrist in the year before his death.Outwardly, friends and colleagues do not recall Mr. Broeksmit showing signs of stress, although they do say he had always been very private in terms of his inner life. While he peppered his lawyers for updates on various investigations, he also made plans with a group of former colleagues to take a ski trip in February.But on Jan. 26, 2014, instead of meeting his wife and son for lunch, Mr. Broeksmit slung a dog leash over a door in his London home, and hanged himself from it. Left by his side was a neat stack of company documents related to Deutsche\u2019s New York banking operations, and suicide notes addressed to relatives, as well as one to Mr. Jain.\u201cYou were good to me,\u201d Mr. Broeksmit wrote to the man he had known for over 30 years, adding, \u201cI am eternally sorry.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Financial Vetting Goes Slowly for Trump\u2019s Wealthy Cabinet Picks", "Date": "2016-12-22", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Some of President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s most prominent cabinet nominees \u2014 with their millions in assets and complex business arrangements \u2014 are moving unusually slowly through the government\u2019s arduous financial disclosure examinations, threatening the quick start promised for the new administration and raising Democratic concerns that their confirmations could short-circuit customary ethical safeguards.On Thursday, the ranking Democrats on all 16 Senate committees released a joint statement saying they would block confirmation votes until each nominee of Mr. Trump had cleared an F.B.I. background check, completed a financial disclosure statement and ethics agreement approved by the federal Office of Government Ethics, and \u201csatisfied reasonable requests for additional information.\u201dSenator Bob Corker of Tennessee, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland, that panel\u2019s ranking Democrat, engaged in a public spat over Mr. Cardin\u2019s request for three years of tax returns from Exxon Mobil\u2019s chief executive, Rex Tillerson, who has been picked to be the next secretary of state.\u201cAs is long-standing precedent for nominees considered by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the committee has not asked Mr. Tillerson to provide copies of his tax returns,\u201d Mr. Corker said.President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s cabinet and top staff are shaping up to be a mix of wealthy Washington outsiders, Republican insiders and former military officers who have been critical of the Obama administration.\u201cGiven the large and complex financial holdings and boundless, serious potential for conflicts of interest,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, said in an email, \u201cthese nominees need to turn over all relevant financial and background information so that senators can thoroughly review their record before going forward with any hearings.\u201dSeveral of Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet picks would be among the wealthiest public servants in modern history. That alone presents a significant financial-vetting challenge to Senate Republicans, who hope to begin confirmation hearings in a few weeks. Mr. Trump\u2019s selection process \u2014 begun, unlike that of most predecessors, after his election rather than before \u2014 may have added to the challenge of moving quickly now.\u201cThey need to step on the gas and get it done,\u201d said Richard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota who served as chief ethics counsel to President George W. Bush. \u201cThey need to tell the Senate what they are going to do with their assets.\u201dCabinet nominees undergo rigorous background checks by the F.B.I. and the Office of Government Ethics, as well as a complicated process involving the agencies they are nominated to run. This is to ensure that nominees have no financial conflicts of interest or outstanding tax matters that could later expose them to criminal prosecution.For nominees with extensive financial holdings, preparation for confirmation hearings can take weeks or even months, as was the case with Penny Pritzker, a billionaire who is President Obama\u2019s commerce secretary. Previous new administrations have taken longer to name cabinet picks than Mr. Trump has done, in part because they were doing their own vetting that the Trump transition has largely forgone.Three people who have discussed Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees with officials involved in the screening, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private deliberations of a highly secretive government agency, were told of the slow pace, which has alarmed Senate Democrats.Mr. McConnell has said he hopes to move ahead on several of Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees \u201con Day 1.\u201d Emails to Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team were not returned.Many of Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees come with a complex web of financial interests and investments. They include Mr. Tillerson; Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner picked to head the Treasury; the billionaire investor Wilbur L. Ross Jr., chosen as commerce secretary; and Betsy DeVos, the president-elect\u2019s choice to run the Department of Education.A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.In keeping with longstanding committee precedent, it has not asked Mr. Tillerson to provide his tax returns, Senator Corker said. \u201cBy all accounts, Mr. Tillerson is currently ahead of schedule in providing information to the committee,\u201d he added. \u201cHe already has submitted a completed nominee questionnaire and will soon submit an extensive financial disclosure.\u201dBut Mr. Cardin voiced the fears of some Democrats that Mr. Tillerson and other nominees \u2014 and Republican committee chairmen \u2014 may take their cues from Mr. Trump\u2019s unusual decision not to release his own tax returns.Republicans say the concern is misplaced.A spokeswoman for Mr. Hatch said on Wednesday that the committee would not schedule a hearing before completion of the bipartisan vetting process.Selections made during a transition are more complicated than those of a sitting president because a nomination cannot be officially made until the new president is sworn in.Candidates typically start to put together their prospective cabinet during the campaign; the former governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney, conducted an extensive vetting process during his failed 2012 White House run.When an incoming president has chosen a nominee, the transition office works immediately to get forms in order for the ethics office and the F.B.I. The F.B.I. does its own significant vetting, which has been the downfall of some nominees, frequently over tax issues or payments to domestic workers. Often this review is done long before the nomination arrives on Capitol Hill.Federal ethics law requires that financial disclosure forms be submitted no later than five days after a formal nomination, or before a nominee\u2019s hearing, whichever is earlier. Generally, if nominees have any financial entanglements that could create real or potential conflicts of interest, they work with an ethics compliance employee to come up with a plan to address those conflicts. In many cases, though not all, a nominee resolves conflicts through divestiture, the use of a blind trust or a formal recusal from certain matters.This practice protects the public interest, but also the nominee. Cabinet members later found to be acting in their own financial interest in their official capacity can be prosecuted.\u201cIf you have substantial assets, they want some sort of assets agreement,\u201d Mr. Painter said. \u201cThat can take a few weeks, especially with billionaires.\u201dDemocrats insist the process cannot be disregarded. \u201cWhen you occupy this country\u2019s highest positions of power, you manage trillions of dollars, enforce more than two centuries of law, control the world\u2019s most powerful military and make decisions that are literally matters of life and death,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee. \u201cThat\u2019s why nominees need a thorough vetting process, not a rubber stamp.\u201dMaggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Problem for Democratic Leaders Is Democratic Voters", "Date": "2016-12-22", "News": "Supported byLeaders on the Democratic left who want to represent the have-nots face an obstacle: their own voters.Keith Ellison, a congressman from Minnesota and a candidate for the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee, argues that Democrats \u201chave to stand for a strong, populist economic message.\u201d He warns that \u201cthe way the working class is always controlled is that it\u2019s divided.\u201dA key Ellison supporter in the fight for the chairmanship, Senator Bernie Sanders, believes thatDemocrats are focused too much with a liberal elite, which is raising incredible sums of money from wealthy people in the upper middle class, but has ignored to a very significant degree the working class and the middle class and low-income people in this country.a global race to the bottom to boost the profits of large corporations and Wall Street by outsourcing jobs; undercutting worker rights; dismantling labor, environmental, health, food safety and financial laws; and allowing corporations to challenge our laws in international tribunals rather than our own court system.The problem facing Ellison, Sanders and their allies is that despite the success of Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign, the Democratic electorate has actually become less receptive to populism over the past two decades.Mark Muro, the director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at Brookings, analyzed the differences between those communities that supported Hillary Clinton and those that backed Donald Trump. The findings of Muro and Sifan Liu, a Brookings research assistant, suggest that Democrats who are calling for a return to progressive populism will encounter more hurdles than they expect.The less-than-500 counties that Hillary Clinton carried nationwide encompassed a massive 64 percent of America\u2019s economic activity as measured by total output in 2015.In other words, the Clinton counties are the ones in which the economy is booming; they are hardly fertile territory for a worker insurrection.Muro enlarged on his findings in an email:These industries encompass the nation\u2019s \u201ctech\u201d sector at its broadest and most consequential. Their dynamism is going to be a central component of any future revitalized U.S. economy. As such, these industries encompass the country\u2019s best shot at supporting innovative, inclusive, and sustainable growth.The importance of these industries does not stop there:The upcoming trade vote in Congress is about one thing: Americans who work hard for a living. It\u2019s about whether we slow down and change the terms of a bad trade deal so that it benefits working people \u2014 those Americans who lay awake at night wondering how they\u2019re going to make ends meet.Ellison\u2019s argument rings especially true in those counties Clinton lost, but in the counties where she and other Democrats won strongly, free trade has been enormously beneficial.In other words, as Muro made clear in his email:shows that trade dislocation (measured in trade adjustment assistance certifications) is far less concentrated in Clintonite large metros than it has been in Trumpian rural counties.From 2009 to October 2016, Democratic voters have shifted from a lukewarm pro-trade stance, 48-37, 11 points in favor, to a decisively pro-trade position, 56-31. The Democratic electorate is moving in a pro-trade direction, in opposition to Ellison and Sanders.Conversely, the Republican electorate, egged on by Donald Trump, has flipped. As recently as March 2014, before anyone gave a thought to a Trump presidential bid, Pew found that Republican voters were solidly in the free trade camp, 55-36. By October 2016, Republican voters had become decisively anti-trade, 68-24.If anything, Trump\u2019s adamant opposition to free trade agreements and his call for the adoption of protectionist tax and tariff policies, are likely to push Democratic voters who oppose Trump to shift even further in favor of trade.This push-me, pull-you phenomenon can be seen in at least two other areas \u2014 in attitudes toward the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and toward Julian Assange\u2019s WikiLeaks.Among Democrats during this same period, Putin\u2019s negative ratings worsened, from minus 52 to minus 62.An even more dramatic shift can be seen in the case of WikiLeaks, the conduit for the release of the hacked Democratic Party emails.In June 2013, well before the campaign, when WikiLeaks was best known for publishing secret government documents, Republicans were adamantly critical by negative 47 points. By August 2016, when the damage by WikiLeaks to the Clinton became apparent, Republicans had turned favorable, by 9 points; by December, Republicans were solidly positive in favor of WikiLeaks, by 27 points. This is a 74-point shift in just under three and a half years.Democrats once more moved in the opposite direction, with their disapproval of WikiLeaks moving from negative 3 points in 2013 to negative 28 points this month.Looking again at free trade, the problem for Democrats struggling to find common ground on the issue is that, as Gary Jacobson, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego, observed in an email,the pull is stronger than the push; people react more strongly to losses from free trade than to prospective gains.In effect, even though a majority of Democrats may support free trade, the minority has, in many cases, suffered from the uneven distributional impact \u2014 shuttered local factories and jobs shipped overseas. Those harmed by a policy are much more likely to vote on the issue than those helped.Although Trump\u2019s protectionist proposals to deal with trade and outsourcing could prove disastrous to economic growth over time, he has offered the business community carrots (tax breaks and contracts) and sticks (tariffs and tax penalties) that have for the moment stifled industry opposition and allowed Trump to win over millions of voters.Democrats addressing trade and globalization concerns face not only a base sharply split over these issues, but also growing difficulties in the party\u2019s traditional responses to employment dislocation. Both job training and education have become increasingly ineffective.An August 2016 study by Robert G. Valletta, an economist at the Federal Reserve in San Francisco, \u201cRecent Flattening in the Higher Education Wage Premium,\u201d shows that since 2010 the steadily rising economic gains from completing college and, even more so, from a graduate degree, have leveled off.The swelling number of workers with postsecondary education combined with the worldwide economic slowdown have resulted in a process economists call \u201cskill downsizing.\u201d Those with graduate degrees are forced to take jobs that a college graduate could do, college graduates are forced to take jobs that someone with less education could do, and so on down the line, leaving fewer and fewer good jobs for the newly trained or retrained.Despite Trump\u2019s nostalgia for a bygone era when the United States was insulated from global trade, stopping or slowing trade is not at issue. Global trade volumes \u2014 imports plus exports \u2014 have grown from 25 percent of global GDP in the mid-1960s to 60 percent today. In the United States, that same metric has grown from 10 percent to 30 percent.Bernstein and Wallach go on to point out that trade agreementsare not mainly about cutting tariffs to expand trade nor are they about jobs, growth, and incomes here in the United States. Rather, they\u2019re about setting expansive \u201crules of the road\u201d that determine who wins and who loses.The problem is not with trade itself, which the authors recognize is both desirable and inevitable, but lies instead in the design of the negotiation process:With 500 official U.S. trade advisers representing corporate interests having been given special access to the policy process while the public, press, and largely Congress have been shut out, it is not surprising that corporate interests have thoroughly captured the negotiating process and ensured they are the \u2018winners\u2019 under these rules.Bernstein and Wallach make a potentially constructive attempt to deal with one aspect of the Democratic Party\u2019s key dilemma: the struggle to prevail in national elections while accommodating the conflicting interests of diverse constituencies \u2014 including the conflict between the Sanders-Warren-Ellison wing and the free-trade wing.Conciliation along these lines has become more difficult as international competition crosses national boundaries, indifferent to domestic regulation and legislation. The 2016 election demonstrates beyond a shadow of a doubt that ducking and weaving around the anguish of displaced workers guarantees sustained minority status.The nation\u2019s displaced work force includes not only the white working class but millions of Hispanics and African-Americans who are loyal to the Democratic Party. Effective and muscular policies focused on reversing the devastation that globalized trade, automation and competition with foreign workers have inflicted on middle and lower income Americans are essential to encourage defecting whites to return to Democratic ranks \u2014 and they are also crucial for reviving Election Day enthusiasm among the nation\u2019s growing population of minority voters. In this regard, the political desires of the two groups are not irreconcilable.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A (Short) Lifetime Spent Preparing for the Family Business", "Date": "2016-12-18", "News": "Supported byWith a baby face that belies even his tender age, Alexandre Tanguay is still occasionally stopped by security personnel in opposing arenas and asked to present his bona fides.Despite a lifetime already spent in hockey, Tanguay laughs off the nuisance with a good-natured shrug. He is the owner of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League\u2019s Rimouski Oceanic and, at 23, one of the youngest owners in professional sports.Juggling his job as chairman of the Oceanic\u2019s board of directors with his responsibilities as a finance major at the University of Quebec, he certainly has his hands full. But it is a role for which Tanguay, a member of one of Quebec\u2019s prominent hockey families, has long been groomed.\u201cI grew up in junior hockey,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I was a young kid I used to go there, watch hockey. I had a chance to grow up around hockey.\u201dTanguay\u2019s grandfather Maurice made the family fortune with a chain of popular furniture stores. While Maurice Tanguay oversaw the Oceanic after bringing the club to Rimouski in 1995, his youngest grandson was a fixture around the team. Ultimately, Maurice, who turned 83 in October, transferred his Oceanic ownership stake to Alexandre in 2015 after close to 60 years in Quebec hockey.\u201cMy grandpa came to see me, and we sat down,\u201d Tanguay said. \u201cIt was important for him to keep our family involved in the Oceanic. I\u2019m such a fan of hockey, so it was so easy to say yes to the chance I have at my age. It was a great honor to take his place.\u201dThe keen hockey sense demonstrated by Tanguay\u2019s grandfather did not skip a generation. Jacques Tanguay, Alexandre\u2019s father, is also a respected figure in the Q.M.J.H.L. He worked with the Hall of Fame N.H.L. goaltender Patrick Roy to bring the Quebec Remparts to the league in 1997. With Roy as the team\u2019s coach, general manager and vice president of hockey operations, the Remparts became a junior hockey powerhouse that in 2006 won the Memorial Cup, Canadian junior hockey\u2019s ultimate prize. Jacques Tanguay still serves as the team\u2019s president.While Alexandre\u2019s father and grandfather earned their junior hockey stripes as owners and executives, he first earned respect within Quebec hockey circles for his abilities on the ice. In two seasons playing for the Oceanic, he became a reliable role player who demonstrated that his opportunity to play had been earned and not inherited.\u201cWe treated him like all the players,\u201d said Serge Beausoleil, who coached Tanguay with the Oceanic and is the team\u2019s head coach and general manager. \u201cThat was really clear in the beginning.\u201dNo one has charted Tanguay\u2019s development more closely than Beausoleil. Before joining the Oceanic, he coached Tanguay on a lower-level team and even taught him history in high school. When Tanguay, then 22, took over the Oceanic, Beausoleil was immediately eyed as a mentor who could teach him the nuances of junior hockey.\u201cThat\u2019s pretty weird, but I\u2019m really fortunate to work with him because he has a good hockey sense, he knows the game well,\u201d Beausoleil said. \u201cIt\u2019s a family tradition. It\u2019s a legacy for them to raise their kids with values, and they have to deserve what they want. It\u2019s good to work with him.\u201dTanguay concluded his playing career in 2012 before spending a year in Madrid studying Spanish. The expectation was that he would eventually take over the Oceanic \u2014 two older brothers went into the family furniture business \u2014 but even Alexandre was caught off guard when his grandfather approached him.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect it that young,\u201d he said. \u201cI really appreciate what he did for me and the chance he\u2019s given me at such a young age. The best moment was probably when I got the chance to assist the draft table for the first time with my grandpa. I could see him very happy about having his grandson there with him.\u201dTanguay is consulted on every hockey decision made by Beausolei and plays a sizable role in the team\u2019s daily operations. That means maintaining healthy relationships with sponsors, contractors, staff and the roughly 50 Rimouski-area businessmen who own minority stakes in the club. He especially enjoys imparting wisdom to his players, many of whom are only a few years his junior.But there was one player in particular who forever altered the trajectory of Tanguay\u2019s hockey education. The turning point for both Tanguay and the franchise came with the arrival of Sidney Crosby, who was already considered a once-in-a-generation prospect when he came to Rimouski in 2003 as a 16-year-old phenom.\u201cWe all knew he was going to be a huge superstar. It was just amazing during that time,\u201d Tanguay said. \u201cMedia from all over the world came to Rimouski and wanted an interview with Sidney. Sold out every game. We had people from all over the world buying tickets, calling for tickets, just wanting to come and see him play one game.\u201dCrosby was among the Oceanic alumni, along with Vincent Lecavalier and Brad Richards, who provided video tributes to Maurice Tanguay during a pregame ceremony on Dec. 9, when a banner honoring the former owner was raised.With Crosby now a global star and the team under the watchful eye of an owner who still lists homework among his primary responsibilities, the Oceanic have still remained competitive. They defeated the Remparts in the league final to win the championship in 2015. Last season, Tanguay\u2019s first as owner, they finished second in the Q.M.J.H.L.\u2019s East Division before being eliminated in the first round of the playoffs.Tanguay is looking forward to continuing his stewardship in Rimouski now that his college graduation is within sight. And he is content to patiently field questions from arena security guards unaware they are denying entry to a visiting team executive.\u201cI usually try to have my Rimouski clothes on, but it happens. Not all the time, but often,\u201d Tanguay said. \u201cYou can\u2019t be mad about this. When they realize they made a mistake, we just laugh about it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They had used opioids, mostly heroin and fentanyl. Many had been incarcerated. Few had families they could turn to for help, and the fathers of their babies were out of the picture.Most of these women \u2014 tough, sassy, vulnerable \u2014 were destined to go through their pregnancies in a shelter, jail or even on the street, fending for themselves as they had often done before.Instead, here they were last week, in the cozy kitchen of a classic 1856 New England farmhouse where the aroma of fresh-baked cornbread filled the air. Set before them was a comfort lunch of tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches.Hope on Haven Hill, financed by $480,000 in federal funds and more than $150,000 in private donations, provides a safe, supportive environment where eight women who are either pregnant or newly postpartum can live while receiving comprehensive treatment and counseling for substance use disorders. Their days will be highly structured, with group therapy, private counseling, childbirth classes, life skills coaching, recovery support services and enrichment programs. Medicaid will reimburse Hope on Haven Hill for the services.Because opioid users are vulnerable to relapsing after they deliver, the women can stay at Hope on Haven Hill for up to a year after giving birth. If they have other children under 5, those children can live here, too. This is part of Haven Hill\u2019s philosophy of keeping mothers and babies together and alleviating the widespread fear among pregnant drug users that if they seek help, their children will be taken away.New Hampshire has two other small facilities for pregnant women with substance use issues. But as the opioid epidemic has worsened, both have long waiting lists.The need is growing, as evidenced by the sharp rise in the number of babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome, in which the newborn suffers withdrawal from the mother\u2019s drug use.In 2000, the syndrome was diagnosed in 1.5 babies per 1,000 births in New Hampshire; by 2012, that rate had soared to 15 babies per 1,000 births, said Dr. Bonny L. Whalen, a newborn pediatrician at Children\u2019s Hospital at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H.The rate now, she said, is even higher.Emma Lee, a tiny infant born with neonatal abstinence syndrome, was the first baby to arrive at Hope on Haven Hill on opening day last week. She had spent all 32 days of her life in a neonatal intensive care unit because her mother, Amanda, 31, who was homeless for the first six months of her pregnancy, had used heroin for most of that time and then went on methadone.At birth, babies like Emma Lee suddenly lose their opioid supply. Some go into withdrawal and require methadone or morphine to control their symptoms until they can be weaned off.\u201cHer withdrawals were pretty severe,\u201d said Amanda, who did not want her last name used, as she cradled Emma Lee in their sunny bedroom at Hope on Haven Hill. While in the hospital, the baby had difficulty eating. Her hands and legs shook with tremors.\u201cIt was really hard as a mom to see your new baby go through that,\u201d Amanda said. \u201cI know for myself, I know what it feels like to withdraw, and it\u2019s pretty terrible to imagine a tiny helpless baby going through that.\u201dHope on Haven Hill does not accept active drug users. Most of the women have only recently stopped using opioids \u2014 in New Hampshire these days, that usually means heroin and fentanyl. But they cannot detox, because going through withdrawal causes dehydration and increases the risk of miscarriage or of the mother\u2019s self-medicating with opioids to stave off the painful effects of withdrawal. So most of these women are on some kind of medication assisted treatment, either methadone or buprenorphine, which is marketed as Suboxone or Subutex.Erica Vallee, 24, who is five months pregnant, is among those at Hope on Haven Hill on Subutex. She has used heroin since she was 18 and has been in and out of rehab and jail. She says becoming pregnant was \u201cthe only thing\u201d that made her stop using illegal drugs.But like others here, she is afraid of relapsing.\u201cI can\u2019t be left alone because I don\u2019t trust myself,\u201d she said as she scrubbed the dishes in the kitchen sink after lunch.The hope is that the stable, nurturing environment of Haven Hill will provide enough support and encouragement for these women to maintain their sobriety.Dr. Arnold, who owns the Haven Hill house, planned the program with Kerry Norton, a prenatal nurse with whom she worked at a nearby women\u2019s health center. About two years ago, the health center started seeing more and more pregnant women with addiction issues who were not being treated for one reason or another.\u201cThey didn\u2019t have prenatal care,\u201d said Dr. Arnold, an obstetrician and gynecologist. \u201cThey\u2019d show up at the birth center and deliver and have nothing, and their child would be taken out of their custody and they\u2019d be out on the street again.\u201dAmong those who showed up at the health center was Abi Lizotte. She was homeless, pregnant and had been using heroin for at least six years, after her older sister had died from an overdose. Ms. Norton, whose own son had overdosed around this same time, took an interest in her, but Ms. Lizotte skipped appointments and Ms. Norton could not find a treatment program that would take her.\u201cI\u2019m an educated nurse who knows the system, and I couldn\u2019t navigate it,\u201d Ms. Norton recalled. \u201cI thought, \u2018What is everyone else doing?\u2019 And it blew my mind when I realized what everyone else was doing, which was dying.\u201dIn June 2015, after a lengthy and exhaustive struggle, Ms. Norton got Ms. Lizotte \u2014 by this point eight months pregnant \u2014 into treatment in Nashua. That night, Ms. Norton, an insomniac, went home and took to Facebook, where she asked if anyone knew Ellen DeGeneres or Oprah Winfrey or anyone rich enough to establish a treatment program for pregnant women derailed by drugs.Dr. Arnold, a fellow insomniac, wrote back: \u201cI don\u2019t know Ellen and I don\u2019t know Oprah, but I have this house and I\u2019ve wanted to do this same thing for three years now.\u201dThe two started brainstorming and conceived the plan for Hope on Haven Hill. They credit Ms. Lizotte, now 24, sober and the mother of a healthy boy, as their inspiration.Since then, they have overcome mounds of red tape, secured the home\u2019s financing and achieved nonprofit charitable status. In September, Dr. Arnold moved her family \u2014 her husband, two children, two dogs and a cat \u2014 to a smaller home while workers renovated the Haven Hill house to meet the building codes for a residential center. Workers refinished the wide-plank pine floors, and volunteers came in with buckets of paint as new furniture, beds and linens arrived.After a ribbon-cutting ceremony last week, Timothy Rourke, the chairman of the New Hampshire Governor\u2019s Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse, said in an interview that while there was much to celebrate, it was important to remember that the state is in the middle of a crisis.\u201cWe\u2019re still looking at a death rate that is way too high and wait lists that are way too long, and many people are asking for help that doesn\u2019t come fast enough,\u201d he said. \u201cHope on Haven Hill should be a call for all of us to do better.\u201dIts doors barely open, Hope on Haven Hill already has a lengthy waiting list of its own.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italy Enters a Transition Phase, Complex but Familiar, as Its Premier Quits", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byROME \u2014 For once, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi doesn\u2019t seem to be in a hurry.Elections might be most satisfying for a restive public, except that an electoral law approved last year is under court review and may now be obsolete after Sunday\u2019s referendum.For Italians who keep insisting they are hungry for change, Monday\u2019s vote had the effect of ushering in an Italian Groundhog Day.\u201cIt\u2019s not a new thing,\u201d said Massimo Franco, a political columnist at the Corriere della Sera newspaper who said the transition toward new elections would probably last at least eight months but as long as a year and a half. \u201cItalians aren\u2019t shocked.\u201dInstead, Italians found themselves drafting another political autopsy report, this time to understand what did Mr. Renzi in. Some pointed to a sluggish economy that failed to deliver the jobs and prosperity he promised. Others spoke about their sincere disagreements with Mr. Renzi\u2019s constitutional overhaul. Many attributed Mr. Renzi\u2019s downfall to haughtiness, and to tying his political fate to that of the referendum. And just about everyone agreed that a strong anti-establishment wave had washed Mr. Renzi out.Yet anointing the Five Star Movement as Italy\u2019s next power overlooks the complexities of Italian politics. To overthrow Mr. Renzi, the Five Star Movement made common cause with other parties aligned with the Italian establishment, including lifelong officeholders and others such as former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, as well as leftist leaders and recipients of public benefits and labor protections.But now that Mr. Renzi is out of the way, those powerful interests of the left, right and center appear poised to return to business as usual, dividing power among themselves and probably shutting out the Five Star Movement, which refuses, per its party\u2019s purity laws, to form political alliances.\u201cThey think they won but they are actually the losers,\u201d said Roberto D\u2019Alimonte, a political scientist at Luiss Guido Carli University in Rome who has advised Mr. Renzi on changing election laws. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to make alliances. They are stuck.\u201dThis summer, as he was already campaigning to pass the constitutional changes, Mr. Renzi noted the irony of Italy\u2019s populists campaigning against him. \u201cParadoxically, if the Five Star Movement wanted to govern, it would be in their interest to vote for this reform,\u201d Mr. Renzi said in an interview. \u201cBut they like to say \u2018No.\u2019\u201dFor months, Five Star leaders excoriated the so-called Italicum, the electoral law Mr. Renzi had passed to bring more stability for Italian governments. It created a runoff system between national candidates that awarded the winner a bonus of seats in the lower house of Parliament. Those extra seats gave the electoral winner a parliamentary majority and essentially ensured a full, collapse-proof term.But the electoral law was intended to complement the constitutional changes on Sunday\u2019s ballot, which would have streamlined Italy\u2019s Parliament by reducing the power and size of the Senate. Now that the constitutional changes have been defeated, the new electoral law is also moot.Before Sunday, Mr. Grillo and other members of his party called Mr. Renzi\u2019s electoral law, now also under review by Italy\u2019s constitutional court, an invitation to dictatorship. But immediately after Mr. Renzi\u2019s defeat, Mr. Grillo had changed his mind.\u201cThe fastest, most realistic and concrete thing to do is immediately hold a vote with the law that already exists, the Italicum,\u201d Mr. Grillo wrote on his blog, while acknowledging \u201cwe\u2019ve always criticized this law.\u201dHow leaders of European populist movements have reacted to the election of Donald J. Trump.The more likely option now, according to several analysts here, is that Mr. Mattarella would form a new coalition government most likely led by a member of Mr. Renzi\u2019s cabinet. On Monday, a few names began to surface as possible successors to Mr. Renzi, including his finance minister, Pier Carlo Padoan; his culture minister Dario Franceschini; or Pietro Grasso, president of the Senate.It has been a long time since Italy has directly elected its leader. Mr. Renzi came to power in an internal party coup in 2014. Mr. Franco, the columnist, argued that part of the reason so many Italians turned out to reject Mr. Renzi\u2019s reform was that they believed it was his attempt to use the constitutional overhaul to \u201ccancel the original sin that he wasn\u2019t elected.\u201dThe last time the country directly chose its prime minister was in 2008, when it voted for Mr. Berlusconi.Mr. Mattarella will almost surely demand that the caretaker government he appoints reconcile the electoral law before he sets a date for early elections.When that time comes, Mr. Renzi could very well return to power. He lost 60 percent of the vote in Sunday\u2019s referendum \u2014 yet that \u2018No\u2019 vote belongs to many parties, not just one. Mr. Renzi showed that the other 40 percent of Italians are either behind him or his reform agenda. For now, Mr. Renzi\u2019s immediate fight, should he choose to remain relevant, is to retain his position as leader of his Democratic Party.\u201cIt would be more destabilizing if he steps down as party leader than as prime minister,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Alimonte said.That all seemed very far away on Monday night. Hours after delivering a concession speech that is all but unheard-of in Italy, complete with congratulations to the victors, tears and odes to a spouse and children, Mr. Renzi\u2019s sedan slipped into the president\u2019s residence.In Mr. Mattarella\u2019s private study, the president asked about Mr. Renzi\u2019s children and then turned to the question at hand, with Mr. Renzi offering his resignation. After an efficient, half-hour meeting, Mr. Renzi left with his resignation, for now, deferred.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "It Turns Out Spending More Probably Does Improve Education", "Date": "2016-12-12", "News": "Supported byLearning and FundingIf you spend more on education, will students do better?For many years, research on the relationship between spending and student learning has been surprisingly inconclusive. Many other factors, including student poverty, parental education and the way schools are organized, contribute to educational results.Teasing out the specific effect of money spent is methodologically difficult. Opponents of increased school funding have seized on that ambiguity to argue that, for schools, money doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 and, therefore, more money isn\u2019t needed.But new, first-of-its-kind research suggests that conclusion is mistaken. Money really does matter in education, which could provide fresh momentum for more lawsuits and judgments like the Connecticut decision.The post-1990 time frame is important: That\u2019s when courts changed how they think about states\u2019 obligations to public schoolchildren. Previously, nearly all school funding lawsuits focused on the question of \u201cequity\u201d \u2014 did disadvantaged students receive funding equal to that of their well-off peers?\u201cThere\u2019s been this wave of school finance reform across the country over the last few decades,\u201d Mr. Rothstein said. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say it\u2019s the largest reform aimed at equity since school desegregation, and we really didn\u2019t know what the impacts were. There\u2019s now growing evidence, from my work and from others, that those reforms did lead to improved achievement and improved outcomes for children in low-income school districts.\u201dAlthough NAEP results are usually published only for whole states and a small number of large urban school districts, the researchers got the education department to let them analyze individual student scores. Those results include information on the test-taker\u2019s race and income, as well as school district attended. The researchers could compare performance in poor and wealthy districts before and after changes in spending.That study was conducted by C. Kirabo Jackson of Northwestern, Rucker C. Johnson from the University of California at Berkeley and Claudia Persico, then a graduate student at Northwestern and now an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin. They examined outcomes for about 15,000 people, born between 1955 and 1985, and found that for poor children, a 10 percent increase in per-pupil spending each year of elementary and secondary school was associated with wages that were nearly 10 percent higher, a drop in the incidence of adult poverty and roughly six additional months of schooling.\u201cThe notion that spending doesn\u2019t matter is just not true,\u201d Mr. Jackson said. \u201cWe found that exposure to higher levels of public K-12 spending when you\u2019re in school has a pretty large beneficial effect on the adult outcomes of kids, and that those effects are much more pronounced for children from low-income families.\u201dDonald J. Trump\u2019s recent nomination of Betsy DeVos, a wealthy Republican fund-raiser and longtime supporter of private school vouchers, to be secretary of education probably won\u2019t help the cause of those who want to use this research to spend more in high-poverty public school districts.Mr. Rothstein cautioned that the idea that states could erase the achievement gap between poor and middle class students by simply cutting a few checks was unrealistic. \u201cThere has been a tendency to expect magic from these reforms,\u201d he said.But a change does not have to solve a problem completely, he said, to be valuable.\u201cWe should consider them successful if they contribute in a meaningful way to closing the gap,\u201d Mr. Rothstein said. \u201cWe have to make some assessment as to whether it\u2019s enough to matter, but enough to matter can be quite a bit less than totally eliminating it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Obamacare \u2018Delay\u2019 Plan Could Backfire", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byPublic HealthJust a few weeks ago, Donald J. Trump and Republicans in Congress were talking about how Obamacare\u2019s insurance markets were floundering, and how insurance companies were fleeing while prices were spiraling out of control.Now, Republican leaders are considering a legislative effort to roll back major provisions of the health law, but the plan they\u2019re considering would keep the current system in place for at least two and possibly three more years.The plan might be better described as \u201czombification.\u201d It is not at all clear that Republicans can easily time the expiration date of the Obamacare markets. Insurance experts say the resulting zombie market \u2014 not dead, but not alive either \u2014 would suffer from many of the maladies of the existing system, and quite a few more. The result on the books might look like the status quo, but millions of Americans could lose their insurance and others could pay much higher prices to keep their coverage.Obamacare was devised as a market system rather than a government program like Medicare. Private insurers compete to offer health plans to customers who don\u2019t get insurance from their jobs or the government. It sets up rules and establishes federal subsidies to help encourage people to buy insurance. But it relies on the voluntary participation of insurance companies to function.There\u2019s nothing in the health law that forces insurance companies to sell insurance if they don\u2019t want to \u2014 as we learned this year, when several major carriers exited the market. And there\u2019s good reason to think that, with the death of Obamacare looming, many more companies would rethink their decision to sell Obamacare policies in the zombie interval.\u201cWhy go through the hassle for something that\u2019s going away anyway?\u201d said Jon Kingsdale, who teaches at Boston University and is a director at the actuarial firm Wakely Consulting Group. Mr. Kingsdale, a former insurance executive, said that insurance companies had tended to weigh the short-term pain of remaining in the Obamacare markets against their long-term hope that markets would stabilize, grow and prove profitable. That calculus would change in an instant if the law were repealed, he said. \u201cThis is the perfect excuse to get out,\u201d he said.One important part of Obamacare would hold steady during the zombie period, however: The Medicaid expansion, now underway in a majority of states, does not rely on a private market for insurance companies. States would be able to continue offering coverage to poor Americans through Medicaid, even if Obamacare\u2019s end were inevitable. Medicaid expansion is responsible for about half of the health law\u2019s recent reductions in the uninsured.Christopher Condeluci, who was a G.O.P. finance committee counsel when Obamacare passed and now runs a policy consulting business, said he had spoken with current staffers considering such options. Over the last few years, Republicans have resisted changes that would make Obamacare work better, but Mr. Condeluci said that the election had shifted the outlook.\u201cIf there\u2019s disruption, even in a wait for repeal and replace, Republicans are going to look terrible,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the Democrats are going to rightly blame them.\u201dThe package of sweeteners might include rules that make it harder for sick people to buy insurance in the middle of the year, and changes that would raise prices for older customers while lowering them for younger ones. Democrats in Congress might even vote for such a package in order to help the Obamacare markets survive.But those fixes, long requested by insurance companies expecting an enduring Obamacare market, may not be enough once a repeal deadline looms. A \u201crepeal and delay\u201d approach means that even a propped-up market would exist for only a few more years.For insurers that are losing money now as the market finds its legs and that are well-established in other lines of business, there is less incentive to stick around. The motivation for health plans, particularly large, national for-profit companies, had always been that Obamacare was a long-term growth opportunity, worth some headaches and losses early on. With the program\u2019s end in sight, that hope would be gone, and insurers might balk at the effort required to change products and comply with new, more generous rules.Things will probably stay stable through the end of next year. Insurance companies have signed contracts to offer health plans, and people have already signed up for them.After that, the future may be less certain than the G.O.P. plan\u2019s nickname suggests. Exits might not happen everywhere, but just as the Obama administration has struggled to keep reluctant insurers in the market, there would be little the Trump administration could do to prevent further insurer flight.The result could be bare patches around the country \u2014 places where no company is selling insurance, and where no one can get access to tax credits to buy it. That might look a lot more like a quick repeal plan than a carefully planned \u201cdelay.\u201dAdvertisement"}
