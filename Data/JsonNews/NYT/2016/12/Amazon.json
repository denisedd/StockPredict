{"Headline": "\u2018The Man in the High Castle\u2019: An Alternative America Hits Home", "Date": "2016-12-15", "News": "Supported byCritic's Notebook\u201cThe Man in the High Castle,\u201d which returns with its second season on Friday, depicts an America changed by conquest, not an election, and changed far more starkly. (In its back story, Franklin D. Roosevelt was assassinated, and the United States did not enter the war until too late.) As the internet has taught us, Nazi analogies tend to crush nuance into fine powder.But if it would be hyperbole to treat the series like a documentary, it would be denial to say it plays no differently now than it did before. However hopeful some people may find the election results, there are also bigots who feel validated, for whom the permission to bully and strong-arm was not a sad side effect of the campaign but the whole point.And \u201cThe Man in the High Castle,\u201d a drama about finding the imagination to resist darkness, has a new relevance, asked for or not.Its early-1960s America \u2014 a Nazi regime on the East Coast, Japanese occupation in the West and a buffer zone between \u2014 was impeccably detailed by the executive producer Frank Spotnitz (\u201cThe X-Files\u201d). (Mr. Spotnitz stepped down as showrunner halfway through the second season; because Amazon provided only the first half for review, I can\u2019t say if his loss hurt the show.)The visual details are striking (if marred by some plasticky CGI) and the cultural ones are chilling. There\u2019s a prime-time Nazi-cop show that normalizes the police state. Bubble-gum pop plays on the radio, while \u201cNegro\u201d music is available only via pirate broadcasts from the neutral zone. Hitler\u2019s forces have reshaped America not by imposing Teutonic culture on it but by using, or warping, what was already at hand.The new season spotlights the indoctrination of the young. It opens at a Nazi-run school whose classrooms are decked with \u201cPurity\u201d posters. Later, Joe Blake (Luke Kleintank), a Nazi agent with a nagging conscience, reads to his son from \u201cThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.\u201d (Key passage: \u201cWhat\u2019s the use you learning to do right when it\u2019s troublesome to do right and ain\u2019t no trouble to do wrong?\u201d) The boy is puzzled about Huck\u2019s escaped slave friend, Jim. \u201cHow can he be good?\u201d he asks. \u201cHe\u2019s black.\u201dThe show falters most with its central couple, Juliana Crain (Alexa Davalos) and Frank Frink (Rupert Evans), lovers drawn by chance into the anti-fascist movement whose relationship has all the zing of a bowl of warm tapioca.The new season finds them separated, which is no great loss and accelerates the story line involving the resistance. The anti-fascists are trafficking a series of mysterious newsreels that depict alternate histories within this alternate history \u2014 some record a past in which the Allies won the war, some a future nuclear apocalypse.In Mr. Dick\u2019s speculative history, the samizdat material is a book. Changing it into film introduces an element of science fiction or fantasy \u2014 the movies are too lifelike to be explained by special effects.Early this season, we meet the \u201cMan\u201d of the title \u2014 Abendsen (Stephen Root), the scraggly, wild-eyed hermit collecting the films. What are they? Why are they so important? He has few concrete explanations beyond a woolly reference to Carl Jung, and you may wonder if the series\u2019 writers have worked one out yet.But the new season does develop the films thematically. They show how circumstance affects morality; the same people can be good in one reel and evil in another, Abendsen says, \u201cdepending on whether they have food in their belly or they\u2019re hungry, safe or scared.\u201d Resisting ascendant cruelty, the films suggest, is first a problem of imagination: You have to believe in the seemingly impossible.The series is best at showing pockets of moral struggle within an immoral system. Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa gives a delicately calibrated performance as Nobusuke Tagomi, a Japanese trade minister in San Francisco trying to resist the push toward another war. In New York, the American Nazi officer John Smith (Rufus Sewell) confronts the illness of his teenage son, whose life is forfeit under the regime\u2019s eugenics laws.Maybe speaking to extraordinary times is too much burden to place on one middling action fantasy. But \u201cThe Man in the High Castle,\u201d like Juliana and Frank, did not get to pick the era it lives in.Against news like that, \u201cThe Man in the High Castle\u201d seems both a timely provocation and a holdover from another era \u2014 an artifact from an alternative timeline in which, if you wanted to ask, \u201cWhat would I do if it happened here?\u201d you had to watch a TV show.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the Computing Cloud Will Keep Growing and Growing", "Date": "2016-12-25", "News": "Supported byBitsSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Jeff Bezos of Amazon, along with a couple of his rivals, may eventually control much of the $1 trillion global market for business computers and software.It\u2019s the same story at Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform, the other two big cloud companies. Start-ups and giant corporations rent the core resources, along with related software, instead of owning and running their own machines.What\u2019s next? As innovations like artificial intelligence and connected devices become popular, customers are putting cloud components in mobile computing, home games and email marketing campaigns. In other words, the big clouds aim to be everywhere.\u201cWhen has Amazon ever thought about anything other than world domination?\u201d said Lydia Leong, who follows cloud computing at Gartner. Not content to be in big centralized data centers, she said, \u201cthey want to be at the edges, whether that is a customer\u2019s own computers or the Internet of Things.\u201dThis aim for domination was clear at Amazon\u2019s big customer conference, called Re:Invent, which was held in Las Vegas this month. About 32,000 people went to the fourth annual event.In one talk at the conference, an Amazon Web Services executive showed off the company\u2019s 8,700-mile undersea cable, part of an A.W.S. global network that each day adds computing power equal to that inside a Fortune 500 corporation, and spoke about this expansion. He talked about crushing the costs of servers and networking, most likely sad news for old tech giants that make those things, like Dell and Cisco.In a nice bit of showmanship during the main keynote, Andy Jassy, the head of A.W.S., appeared onstage with an 18-wheel truck carrying a device that could suck 100 petabytes of data out of a customer\u2019s computers and put it in the Amazon cloud. That is equal to two billion filing cabinets of paper, which a surprising number of companies now possess in digital form, thanks to things like video and sensors.Put that together with some software Mr. Jassy talked about that would be on chips made by Intel but capable of gaining access to the A.W.S. cloud, and you get the picture: There isn\u2019t a part of computing Amazon doesn\u2019t want to touch.Amazon says it is hardly moving away from a core business of providing large-scale computing, but rather finding more ways to sell stuff related to it by moving to edge devices.\u201cWe see it less as a move from one to the other, and more of an extension,\u201d an Amazon spokeswoman, Mary Camarata, wrote in an email Saturday. \u201cWe have an enormous number of customers excited about leveraging the capabilities.\u201dMachine learning \u2014 a method for computers to gain knowledge without being programmed with that information \u2014 is front and center for Alphabet\u2019s Google, said Urs H\u00f6lzle, the head of technical infrastructure at Google Compute. Google has recently shown off its own global network of submarine cables, along with local devices like cloud-connected office whiteboards. Over the next year, Mr. H\u00f6lzle said, Google will open about one new Compute facility a month.Building out across the globe, with sometimes $1 billion or more in a facility, is critical in some cases to meet local data regulations. Equally, the big cloud companies all want to be as close to customers and their devices as possible.\u201cGlobal proximity is a huge advantage,\u201d said Corey Sanders, the director of program management at Azure. \u201cThis is a way to transform your business, including the way devices on the edge act.\u201dThere are profound consequences from the scale and ambition of this trend. Given their size, wealth and technical expertise, the big cloud companies are likely to build cheaper designs and demand lower prices for everything in computing. Who is to say they don\u2019t affect the devices themselves?That is starting to dawn on the rest of the industry. On the first day of Re:Invent, Mr. Jassy had a private lunch with about 10 venture capitalists. It is an annual affair, where he indicates where A.W.S. is going, and they figure out how to make money from it.\u201cHe wasn\u2019t explicit, but if you were hoping to invest in storage, computing \u2014 anything below applications \u2014 you are hosed,\u201d said Dharmesh Thakker, a partner at Battery Ventures, who attended the lunch. \u201cAndy is smart and approachable, but reading between the lines, I\u2019m not sure this is good for the V.C. ecosystem.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For the Trumps, \u2018Made in U.S.A.\u2019 May Be a Tricky Label to Stitch", "Date": "2016-12-28", "News": "Supported byAt Saks Off Fifth recently, an Ivanka Trump white polyester and spandex blouse made in Indonesia was marked down to $34.99, from $69. A few racks over, her black and white jacket came from Vietnam, while several blocks away, at Macy\u2019s, her leather bootee manufactured in China sold for more than $100.At the Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, a $35 blue cotton cap embroidered with \u201cTrump National Golf Club\u201d was made in Bangladesh. A Trump Tower hoodie from Pakistan set tourists back $50.Should Mr. Trump make good on such promises, he would take aim at not only his own brand, but his daughter\u2019s as well.Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t stand to lose much. While his goods are largely manufactured overseas, most of his retail ventures have gone the way of Trump vodka and steaks. And what products can be found \u2014 at his hotels and golf courses and on Amazon sold by independent sellers \u2014 are the vestiges of a mostly defunct clothing line or sporadic shipments of Trump sweatshirts and hats.Factored into those prices is the cost of materials and production, as well as shipping, tariffs, marketing and advertising expenses. Cheap production overseas means more coin in the coffers of Ms. Trump and the shoe, accessory and clothing makers that are her partners, among them Marc Fisher footwear, the G-III Apparel Group and Mondani. (Ms. Trump\u2019s company, which is privately held, does not disclose its financials.)It is the harsh reality of the clothing business.Before Ms. Trump started her shoe and clothing lines in the early 2010s, she did what any well-connected New Yorker would, consulting corporate chieftains, fashion designers and department store executives. She ultimately decided to license her name.Since then, Ms. Trump, 35, has pondered making some items in-house. Investors were consulted, and a business plan was drawn up \u2014 but the project was scrapped, said one person briefed on the discussions. It was costly and impractical, so suppliers continued to make her clothes overseas.\u201cWhen I started my business, I recognized where my strengths were and knew that I didn\u2019t have any experience in production and manufacturing,\u201d Ms. Trump said in a rare interview.\u201cI am not a designer. I am an entrepreneur.\u201dIt is part of a long history of American garment manufacturers chasing cheap labor. They moved to China in the 1980s, then elsewhere in Asia. Now, Chinese shoemakers are building factories in Africa, where wages are about $40 a month, compared with $400 in China.Even then, an overseas strategy does not portend survival, as Mr. Trump\u2019s experience shows.At Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, the Trump Store is downstairs from the lobby, sandwiched between a restaurant and an ice cream parlor. While a $65 white polo golf shirt from Lesotho in southern Africa was available, there was no sign of many of Mr. Trump\u2019s other items, like the dress shirt made in Vietnam on display upstairs.Last year, Macy\u2019s dropped Mr. Trump\u2019s clothing line over inflammatory comments he made about Mexican immigrants. Now about the best place to find his ties, dress shirts and accessories is on Amazon.com \u2014 and even that stock is just a hodgepodge.The company that made Trump-branded comforters and sheets, Downlite, said it had ended its relationship with him last year. His beds, designed by Dorya, aren\u2019t in stores, either. They are made to order overseas, according to the company.Mr. Trump said in campaign interviews that he would like to make his apparel in the United States, but that it was hard to find companies that did. When George Stephanopoulos of ABC pressed him to explain, Mr. Trump said, \u201cThey don\u2019t even make the stuff here.\u201dThat is not exactly true.B J Nickol, president of the All American Clothing Company, based in Arcanum, Ohio, said he employed 15 people, as well as subcontractors in about 20 states who cut, sew and ship shirts, jeans and sweaters. He estimated it cost All American $10 to $15 to manufacture a polo shirt, including fabric and labor. He sells them for about $28 to $38, or about half of what a polo shirt costs at Trump Tower.While the company mostly sells shirts to individuals, Mr. Nickol said he would welcome a big-time customer like Mr. Trump. Mr. Nickol said he had witnessed the impact on his community when apparel manufacturers moved away. \u201cAnd the only way we could think of to fix that was to keep jobs here,\u201d he said.But there are trade-offs, namely price. A pair of women\u2019s jeans made by Todd Shelton costs $200; an Oxford shirt is $180.And cost is only one factor. Fashion is another.Recently, Ms. Trump tried to make a flip-flop in the United States. She and one of her main partners, Marc Fisher, shopped a design to retailers, according to a person with knowledge of the venture. Buyers, though, didn\u2019t like the design \u2014 and it never got made.With the Ivanka Trump brand, another variable now comes into play: politics.Ms. Trump served as a more polished emissary of her father\u2019s messages during the campaign, and she is under pressure to bring jobs home. And in a postelection era, her carefully crafted public persona, which is at the heart of the brand, is at risk.Ms. Trump has found a way to commercialize female empowerment, selling petal pink sheaths and trendy shoes to young professionals on the go. Her brand\u2019s hashtag #womenwhowork often accompanies pitches to buy her satchels and clothes.\u201cShe wants to make sure her reputation is unblemished,\u201d said Marshal Cohen, a consumer behavior and retail analyst at the NPD Group, a research firm.Ms. Trump is already facing some blowback.But it will not drastically change her company\u2019s strategy. She and her team do not plan to move manufacturing back just to quell critics.\u201cIt\u2019s great to say we want to do all of this, but we want to make responsible business decisions, too,\u201d said Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand. \u201cFrom a business perspective, we have to have longevity.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside the Actors\u2019 Dream Studio", "Date": "2016-12-29", "News": "Supported byThe actor\u2019s nightmare is much like the anxiety dreams experienced by many of us who have never stepped onstage.Kim Gillingham, a dream coach who has attracted a stable of working actors, uses Jungian philosophy to help develop their roles. She believes the process of embodying characters profoundly affects the people playing them. \u201cThe psyche can\u2019t tell the difference between a ritual act and a real act,\u201d Ms. Gillingham said in a recent interview, citing the Jungian writer Robert Johnson. \u201cOver eight shows a week, I\u2019m wiring that character\u2019s way of thinking in my actual physical brain. How does my psyche respond to that irritant?\u201dMs. Gillingham asks clients to activate the subconscious through close script readings and dream analysis. Some use their dream lives to help define their characters.Mr. Donovan began working with Ms. Gillingham in 2006 \u201cbasically out of desperation,\u201d he said. \u201cI just wasn\u2019t feeling connected to acting much anymore.\u201d He found himself \u201cshocked at how this worked.\u201d (Mr. Donovan\u2019s recollection of a shard of an image \u2014 \u201ca dog licking a black pot on a street\u201d \u2014 seemed absurd to him at the time, but it helped him develop his lawyer character on the television series \u201cDamages.\u201dThe New York Times asked actors in current and recent stage shows to share what happens when a scripted persona becomes entangled in their own subconscious. These are edited excerpts from the conversations.There was one speech about Nat Turner\u2019s father, when he\u2019s telling the story about when his father ran away. And how he could have run away, and he did, and God told him to come back. I fell asleep working on that speech, and I woke up a few hours later in tears. I woke up weeping, like hard weeping. If you\u2019re working on a scene all night long, it\u2019s not that crazy that you might dream of that scene when you go to bed. But I wasn\u2019t dreaming of it like I was rehearsing. I was dreaming as Nat. I would wake up, and it would feel like, \u201cWhoa, I\u2019ve been working on the scene all night long.\u201dI remember dreams about children being hurt. Waking up and not remembering the specifics but remembering that a child or children had been harmed. Dreams of war, but like very violent. Like hand-to-hand combat. The feeling about wanting to protect children, my desire to want to protect children increased exponentially. Also my desire to even consider adopting a child absolutely increased. I want to have children, too, but I started to think about children with no homes, and I started to think about children\u2019s welfare.My dreams are, curiously, quite a lot about the dead. A lot of people from my past have come up. That\u2019s partly because every night there is a moment when I embody Loren McIntyre [the photographer] at the point of loss of consciousness, where he is convinced that he is dying. And as I do it, I get a very powerful image of the loss of consciousness within myself, but also because I witnessed my father and my mother\u2019s death, I\u2019m very aware of what that is actually like to be next to it. One recurring dream is that I have been flying and crashing in the plane. I can see that the plane will not make the ground. It will be trying to land \u2014 it takes off, but then the moment it takes off, it begins to lose height, and I can see that it\u2019s not going to make it. But it\u2019s not that I wake up just before it crashes, it\u2019s that I can sort of manipulate the dream where the airplane itself very frequently turns into cloth. It becomes a kind of malleable substance instead of being metal.I teach several students all over the country and some even overseas. I have this one student who lives in Lebanon. She\u2019s under a lot of pressures \u2014 economically, from the government, from living situations there. Her greatest dream is to be here in New York, and to be on Broadway, and to be an actor in this country. I have seen her in my dreams, but I have seen her particularly as [the \u201cCats\u201d character] Grizabella. Because of the Grizabella role being the quote-unquote outsider, being the one who\u2019s not accepted, who has faced certain hardships and is judged by those certain things. She wasn\u2019t dressed as a cat, she wasn\u2019t dressed as Grizabella, it wasn\u2019t so glamorous as to say that we were on a stage and there were lights and sound and an audience watching. But she took on the form of, or a type of, Grizabella in the dream.There are watermelons all over my dreams. There\u2019s a point when the entire stage has watermelons all over it. So watermelons pop up a lot because I\u2019m so used to seeing them.There\u2019s only one I can think of in particular, and it\u2019s kind of faded now. One of our cast members who plays Before Columbus was in my dream as a wise jaguar-leopard sort of figure. I was in this jungle, trapped, and he was on top of a cliff. And I met him up there, and he was going to give me, I don\u2019t know, maybe the secret to life [laughs] or some sort of huge advice. But then I woke up before he told me what it was going to be.The spirit of that leopard-jaguar didn\u2019t sound like him, I just knew it was Before Columbus, the character. Before Columbus is sort of wise, all knowing, because he was there before Columbus and was able to speak some truths that had been erased perpetually by history.I don\u2019t remember my dreams very much. When I\u2019m working on a role, I have what I call waking dreams. I open myself up to my unconscious. There will be these images, or pictures, that come into my head as I am literally walking to the rehearsal, that I start implementing in the rehearsal without consciously thinking about it.I would be dreaming about the play, inside the play, waking up saying the dialogue to the play all the time. I\u2019ve always wondered how to survive as an actor when you physically have to do something that\u2019s very tense. Let\u2019s say if you are frightened onstage, which I had to be. So you\u2019re frightened onstage for 90 minutes, every night, and your body thinks that it\u2019s real \u2014 what happens? Eventually in your dreaming life, you\u2019re trying to work all that fear out. So I would have very, very challenging sleeps.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Esports Sees Profit in Attracting Female Gamers", "Date": "2016-12-21", "News": "Supported byMark Religioso, a brand manager for the video game publisher Bandai Namco Entertainment, wants more women to be involved in the professional gaming arena known as esports, where players compete in video game tournaments to win thousands of dollars in prize money.So this year, Mr. Religioso began planning \u201cBonnie and Clyde\u201d tournaments, where esports teams consist of one man and one woman. He also began laying the groundwork for a mentoring program to foster interest in esports among women.\u201cThese are baby steps so that we can get more women on the team,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to make the scene a welcoming place.\u201dMr. Religioso\u2019s efforts are one of several recent moves by video game makers and publishers to increase diversity in esports, which is rapidly becoming one of the video game industry\u2019s most visible segments. As more women play video games, the esports industry is starting to focus on getting more of them involved in professional competition to help the effort expand and become mainstream.\u201cIt\u2019s an extremely toxic environment for women,\u201d said Stephanie Harvey, 30, who is a top competitor in esports tournaments for the game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. \u201cTo be a woman in esports, you have to have a thick skin.\u201dL\u00e2m Hua, the head of content at Oxent, said the women-only tournaments were not entirely successful in drawing more women to esports, but after much debate, the company decided that they were \u201cthe first step in the grand scheme of women recognition in the sport.\u201d For now, he said, they were \u201ca necessary evil.\u201dOther diversity efforts in esports have focused on normalizing the idea of women in gaming. Anna Prosser Robinson, a programming manager and onscreen personality at Twitch, helped push the company\u2019s diversity initiatives after seeing women rise up, then drop out of esports.\u201cWe would see these awesome, compelling women be excited\u201d about esports, she said. \u201cSix months later, they would be gone.\u201d The goal of Misscliks, she said, was to provide support and resources to encourage those women to create a network on Twitch and stay in esports.\u201cInclusivity is a core value of our brand,\u201d Chase, a Twitch spokesman who goes by one name, said of the diversity effort at the convention. \u201cIt was a success this year and definitely something we could consider for next year.\u201dAnyKey, the creation of Intel and ESL to increase the number of women in esports, focuses on two areas. One is research and discussion of the diversity issue, headed by T. L. Taylor, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the other is initiatives and solutions, led by Morgan Romine, a former esports player.AnyKey organized a women-only esports tournament in March at one of the industry\u2019s largest events, the Intel Extreme Masters competition in Katowice, Poland. Ms. Romine said she saw women-only tournaments as a way to strengthen players\u2019 skills and move them into open competition.\u201cThere is a lot of work that needs to be done, giving more women confidence and experience in that space,\u201d she said.Mr. Religioso of Bandai Namco said he began noticing the lack of female esports players at regional esports tournaments last spring, like Final Round in Atlanta and Combo Breaker in Chicago.With the growth in esports, he saw an opportunity to reinvigorate interest in the company\u2019s Tekken franchise. Next year, Bandai Namco will release Tekken 7, a one-on-one fighting game that the company hopes will be popular among esports competitors. Women make up about 23 percent of the fan base for the Tekken fighting games, Mr. Religioso said, but few are playing them competitively.Another solution to encourage more women into esports would be to change the way video games are made and marketed. Stephanie Llamas, director of research and insight at SuperData, said women should be participating more on the business side of the industry and developing games with women in mind.\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to understand the demographic if you are not part of that demographic,\u201d she said.An article on Thursday about efforts by video game makers and publishers to increase diversity in esports misidentified the city in California where the TwitchCon convention took place this year. It was in San Diego, not in San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": " The convenience and ease of online shopping is expected to make online holiday shopping hit new highs in 2016 as consumers skip the crowds and capitalize on sales from the comfort of their couches.  According to Adobe Digital Insights, sales are expected to total $91. 6 billion over the 57 days of the 2016 winter holiday shopping season, an increase of 11 percent over the previous year. For the first time, shoppers are expected to visit retailers\u2019 mobile sites more than desktop sites as they browse for gift ideas at the time and place that suits them best.  But whether shoppers are buying online or in physical stores, the goal for retailers is to make the shopping experience as frictionless as possible. To that end, retailers have been testing various technologies to keep shoppers coming back to their web sites and brick-and-mortar locations.  For instance, imagine when you walk into a store, a robot ushers you through aisles to the items you want to buy. A smart mirror in the dressing room suggests the perfect boots for the jeans you tried on. And by using virtual reality goggles, you\u2019re able to see how a couch looks in your home \u2014 without leaving the store.  Retailers\u2019 goal is twofold: They want to chip away at the things that can make shopping a hassle \u2014 like long lines or dull dressing rooms \u2014 while adding more convenience and personalized service.  \u201cIf it\u2019s high-touch retail, you want to provide great experiences and entertainment,\u201d said Michael Klein, Director of Industry Strategy at tech company Adobe. \u201cBut if it\u2019s grocers or big-box stores, the technology needs to make that experience more seamless and efficient.\u201d  Retailers are using robots and other smart technologies to improve the in-store experience.  Some of these technologies are aimed at saving customers time, something that is a top priority for shoppers. In fact, according to a recent Forrester retail survey, shoppers ranked \u201csaving time\u201d as the top reason to use in-store technology.  One technology being tested is radio frequency identification (RFID) to embed data in clothing tags that allows items to be tracked throughout the stores. Zappos tested RFID last when it installed a Magic Checkout at an event in San Francisco. Shoppers walked over an RFID-reading mat, which scanned the RFID-tagged merchandise in less than a second. Through mobile payment, shoppers could complete the sale in seconds.  There are other uses for RFID, too. UGGs, for instance, is tagging its shoes in one store with RFID so that when shoppers step on a carpet, style tips and product information like \"what sizes are in stock\" pop up on a screen.  Retailers also are adding smart technologies to the oft-forgotten dressing room. Brands that include Bloomingdale\u2019s, Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom are testing smart mirrors that do things like suggest shoes and other accessories. Shoppers also can see how they look in an outfit without trying it on.  The dressing room certainly is ripe for change. Seventy-one percent of shoppers who try on clothes in the fitting room become buyers, but only about a third step foot in dressing rooms to begin with, said Paco Underhill, a retail consultant.  \u201cDressing rooms are one of the few things that are different between online and in-store,\u201d said Andrew Hogan, a Forrester analyst. \u201cYou have the opportunity to make something that was a dead and isolated experience into something much more useful and exciting.\u201d  Merchants also are looking for ways to improve customer service \u2014 both in stores and online \u2014 by experimenting with robots with human characteristics.  While not common in stores yet, robots have huge potential for retailers: Technology experts predict that robotics and artificial intelligence will be in many homes by 2025 \u2014 the same time that experts expect them to become common on retail floors.  Orchard Supply Hardware, which is owned by Lowe\u2019s, is the first to use an autonomous robot on the retail floor.  The robot, called \u201cOSHbot,\u201d speaks multiple languages and is equipped with image recognition to help identify what an item is and guide customers to products in the store.  OSHbot has been successful so far. In the first six months, OSHbot helped 3,000 people with 3,500 searches \u2014 about what a human store associate would achieve in the same time period.  Retailers also are testing robots online through what\u2019s called \u201cconversational commerce.\u201d Chatbots simulate human conversation in the same way that Amazon Echo acts as a digital assistant. Most chatbots run in messaging apps like Facebook Messenger.  The Sephora beauty product store chain and the H&M clothing chain have launched bots on the Kik messaging app that can do things like pull together outfits based on preferences and commands a shopper types, such as \u201cleather jacket.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s the ability to have a conversation with a device that removes the friction that may occur when we\u2019re required to deal with humans or type in a whole bunch of information in a search box,\u201d Adobe\u2019s Klein said.  Retailers also are looking to enhance the shopping experience through virtual and augmented reality.  VR allows consumers to see what products in their homes would look like without leaving the store.  These are areas that retailers want to be in going forward. The VR retail market is expected to rise to $1.6 billion by 2025, according to a Goldman Sachs report. And AR could reach $30 billion in sales, as projected by a Digi Capital report.  Some chains have experimented with AR. Dippin\u2019 Dots, for instance, enabled customers in its loyalty program to make it rain Dippin\u2019 Dots in its stores through AR. And Walgreens added 3-D imagery to its in-store maps.  More big-name retailers are looking at VR, including Lowe\u2019s. The chain last year created the Holoroom, which allows customers to design their kitchen or bathroom space while in its stores, using an app. Then, by using virtual reality goggles, shoppers could step into the design.  Swedish furniture chain IKEA also launched a VR experiment this year, enabling shoppers to explore a kitchen where they can open drawers and change cabinet colors.  Experts say shoppers will continue to see more retailers testing these types of technologies. \u201cThings are moving fast,\u201d said Artemis Berry, vice president of digital retail for the National Retail Federation, a trade group.  And that means, 20 from years from now, shoppers may feel like they\u2019re living in the popular 1960s cartoon \u201cThe Jetsons,\u201d with robots that cater to your every need, both in the store and online. The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}

{"Headline": "When Trump Meets Tech Leaders, Jobs Will Be on the Agenda", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byOther topics will come up too, depending on Mr. Trump\u2019s whims. One likely possibility: the repatriation of offshore cash.The top tech companies collectively hold hundreds of billions of dollars overseas. They would like to return the money to the United States at a beneficial tax rate. For Mr. Trump, a deal on these funds could represent money that would help advance an infrastructure program.The meeting agenda, which was still a work in progress, was described by a person briefed on the round table, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk about it publicly.A Trump transition spokeswoman did not return a request for comment.Those attending the meeting, which will be held at Trump Tower in Manhattan, include:The Information Technology Industry Council, a trade association for the tech industry, held a conference call last Friday with some of its members \u2014 which include Apple, Amazon and Facebook \u2014 to formulate a unified approach. Dean C. Garfield, president of the council, was guarded about the meeting\u2019s prospects.\u201cThere are many areas of potential shared alignment between the technology industry and the incoming Trump administration,\u201d Mr. Garfield said. \u201cWednesday\u2019s meeting is a good opportunity to explore what is possible.\u201dMs. Rometty, a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s Strategic and Policy Forum, is championing a new educational model for the United States that focuses on vocational training. Six-year public high schools that \u201ccombine traditional education with the best of community colleges\u201d would provide IBM and other companies with the relevant skills for \u201cnew collar\u201d information-technology jobs, she wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump after the election.There is no simple policy change that could spread tech\u2019s success to parts of the country that are reeling. Facebook employs relatively few people. Apple manufactures its products mostly in China and says reproducing its intricate ecosystem here would push up prices drastically for iPhones. Amazon has created tens of thousands of jobs in its warehouses across the country but is also blamed by critics for forcing small retailers out of business.Two companies were invited to the meeting on Wednesday but are not showing up: the ride-hailing company Uber and the short-term home rental service Airbnb.Perhaps it is merely coincidence, but both companies are at the forefront of the debate about jobs and the digital economy. Fans say they provide flexible work for those who need to supplement their incomes. Critics say they are poor substitutes for full-time jobs.Airbnb said that its chief executive, Brian Chesky, was traveling overseas, and that nothing more should be read into his absence. \u201cWe look forward to working with the incoming administration, and others in Washington, on a range of issues,\u201d said Nick Papas, a company spokesman. He declined to say where Mr. Chesky was.An Uber spokesman said its chief executive, Travis Kalanick, was in India this week.Apple has already drawn the president-elect\u2019s scrutiny over jobs. \u201cOne of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States,\u201d Mr. Trump said in late November.On Monday, in what perhaps could be seen as a pre-emptive strike, Apple was revealed to be negotiating a major investment in a technology fund celebrated by Mr. Trump last week for its jobs-making potential.Apple has held discussions about potentially participating in a $100 billion fund to be run by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, according to a person briefed on the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions are private.Silicon Valley was largely opposed to Mr. Trump as a candidate \u2014 sometimes vocally, sometimes quietly. In the wake of his election, there is a shift in attitudes. Perhaps it is simple pragmatism, but more conciliatory voices are being heard.Mr. Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post \u2014 a frequent scourge of Mr. Trump during the election \u2014 tweeted his congratulations. \u201cI for one give him my most open mind,\u201d he said.Ms. Catz, the co-chief executive of Oracle, was even more enthusiastic. \u201cI plan to tell the president-elect that we are with him and are here to help in any way we can,\u201d she said in a statement.And on Tuesday, one big tech name met Mr. Trump ahead of the rest. Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and now primarily a philanthropist, was at Trump Tower in the early afternoon.\u201cIt was a good time,\u201d Mr. Gates said. \u201cWe had a good conversation about innovation, how it can help in health, education, the impact of foreign aid and energy, and a wide-ranging conversation about power of innovation.\u201dMichael J. de la Merced, Nick Wingfield and Quentin Hardy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Best Movies of 2016", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byThe film critics of The New York Times \u2014 Manohla Dargis, A. O. Scott and Stephen Holden \u2014 share their picks for the best movies of the year. Though not only: By the time the Academy Awards roll around in February, the United States will have a new president. A few critics I know are trying to name the most Trumplike release of 2016; one suggested Clint Eastwood\u2019s \u201cSully,\u201d which I see more as an exemplar of classic Hollywood\u2019s heroic individualism. Viewing movies through the lens of today is a favorite game, never mind that most titles are in the works long before the real world catches up to them. A more fruitful game may be to weigh how this year\u2019s releases \u2014 be they \u201cMoonlight\u201d or \u201cDeadpool,\u201d \u201cManchester by the Sea\u201d or \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d \u2014 signify the end of the Obama era.As to my own favorites, well, they just keep on changing, depending on mood, both personal and national.\u201cAquarius\u201d (from Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho); \u201cAutumn\u201d and \u201cThe Dreamer\u201d (Nathaniel Dorsky); \u201cBagatelle II\u201d (Jerome Hiler); \u201cCertain Women,\u201d especially Kristen Stewart (Kelly Reichardt); \u201cCreepy\u201d (Kiyoshi Kurosawa); \u201cThe Fits\u201d (Anna Rose Holmer); \u201cThe Illinois Parables\u201d (Deborah Stratman); \u201cInto the Inferno\u201d (Werner Herzog); \u201cJackie\u201d and \u201cNeruda\u201d (Pablo Larra\u00edn); \u201cKrisha\u201d (Trey Edward Shults); \u201cLa La Land,\u201d if mostly its finale (Damien Chazelle); \u201cLoving\u201d (Jeff Nichols); \u201cMountains May Depart\u201d (Jia Zhangke); \u201cPaterson\u201d (Jim Jarmusch); \u201cSunset Song\u201d (Terence Davies); \u201c20th Century Women\u201d (Mike Mills).Am I reading too much into it now, or was I not paying close enough attention then? If so, I\u2019m hardly the only one. Relevance is one of the great shibboleths of criticism, and after a real-life event as dramatic and complex as this year\u2019s election, the temptation to seek clues and answers in works of popular art is almost overwhelming. Think pieces promising to tell us \u201cHow [insert title here] Explains Trump\u201d popped up after Nov. 8 like mushrooms after a rainstorm, and entertainment has been mined for signs and symptoms of working-class disaffection, coastal-elitist bubble-think, fake-news gullibility and every other real and imaginary affliction of the American body politic. But cinema is better at exploring than explaining, and the screen is more like a prism or a kaleidoscope than a mirror or a window. We seldom get the news from movies.Which is not to deny that they are useful tools for reckoning with reality. In a time of confusion, the best films can offer clarity, comfort and a salutary reminder of complexities that lie beyond the bluster and expedience of political discourse and conventional journalism. We go to the movies \u2014 and we still go quite a lot, by the way, in spite of the seductions of the couch and the streaming queue \u2014 in search of escape from reality. We\u2019re also looking for alternative routes to the truth, for sparks of imagination that can ignite or illuminate our own thinking when it gets muddled or stale.These radiant moments soften an otherwise tough movie, about Chiron, a gay black youth played by three different actors, growing up in a Miami housing project where he acquires the armor of a street thug to survive. Along with \u201cBrokeback Mountain\u201d and \u201cBoyhood,\u201d it is one of the three finest movies of the last decade or so. Is it a coincidence that all three have male protagonists who instinctively resist patriarchal brutishness?In its brokenhearted examination of race, class, privilege and inequality in modern America, \u201cMoonlight\u201d is one of several excellent movies set in places beyond the country\u2019s affluent enclaves. When I raved about \u201cMoonlight\u201d to several well-to-do white liberal friends and described Chiron, they politely took note but behaved as if I were telling them to eat their spinach.More highlights from the year, as chosen by our critics:Because of an editing error, a listing last Sunday of Times critics\u2019 favorite films of 2016 misstated the title of a film that Stephen Holden listed as a runner-up for his best movies of the year. It is \u201c13th,\u201d not \u201cThirteen.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Now, the company is trying to computerize the experience of buying sandwiches and soda from the corner convenience store.In the latest in its expanding set of experiments involving bricks-and-mortar retail stores, Amazon has created a small grocery store in Seattle that will allow customers to pluck drinks, prepared meals and other items off shelves and walk out without having to wait in a checkout line, the company said.For now, only Amazon employees can shop in the 1,800-square-foot store, which is on the ground floor of one of the company\u2019s new office towers in downtown Seattle. The company said that it planned to open the store to the public early next year and that it would offer chef-made meal kits with ingredients for quickly preparing dinners at home.Amazon did not say what its expansion plans were for Amazon Go. If they are anything like what the company has done with its other bricks-and-mortar stores, new locations will open elsewhere slowly over time as Amazon learns how customers use the first one.Amazon opened its first physical bookstore just over a year ago in a Seattle shopping mall. It has added others in the San Diego and Portland, Ore., areas and has said it will open new bookstores in Chicago and Boston.Pia Arthur, an Amazon spokeswoman, declined to comment on the grocery pickup locations.In the grand scheme of Amazon\u2019s business, analysts consider the retail stores to be an infinitesimal portion of the more than $135 billion in sales expected from the company this year.But the plans reflect a growing recognition by the company that certain categories of shopping are unlikely to move completely online. In some cases, it is simply more convenient to buy items in a store or more attractive to browse for them on physical shelves.\u201cThe way we think about it is the size of online retail is going to continue to grow dramatically but there will always be an offline option,\u201d said Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to streamline and capture a portion of that offline experience.\u201dAmazon still views technology as being useful in overhauling shopping in traditional retail shops. While the company has not said exactly how the Amazon Go stores will work, visitors will gain entry to them through a smartphone app. The company said the stores relied on a variety of technologies similar to those in self-driving cars, including those defined by buzzwords such as \u201ccomputer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning.\u201dUnanswered for now are questions about how the stores would handle shoplifting and whether there would be employees on hand to check identification cards for alcohol purchases.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Five Resolutions to Simplify Your Tech Life", "Date": null, "News": "Supported byIn 2017, why not try a new kind of New Year\u2019s resolution? Instead of just hitting the gym and dropping some pounds, consider changing some personal habits to simplify the tech in your life.If you are like most people, there are things you do with tech that could use some tweaking. Strengthening your password security, for one, would benefit you tremendously in an era when hacks are rampant. For another, purging the e-junk you have accumulated over the years would help the environment and your sanity. While you\u2019re at it, start doing maintenance on your electronics to make sure they work smoothly this year.P.U. \u2014 what\u2019s that smell? It\u2019s your bad password hygiene. You are probably using the same password across multiple websites for banking, shopping, social media and email. Then add an extra layer of protection by enabling two-factor verification on your accounts whenever the option is available. When you enter your password, you will receive a message (usually a text) with a one-time code that you must enter before logging in.Taking these two simple steps will help safeguard you from the inevitable hacks that arise this year.Do this basic maintenance every six months and your devices will run smoothly for many years. We don\u2019t hesitate to buy new smartphones every two years \u2014 but that neglected, ugly Wi-Fi router tucked away in the corner of the living room may be the most important tech product to upgrade every few years. Among all tech headaches, there is nothing more annoying than a sluggish, spotty internet connection.Start off each new year by doing some checks on your internet infrastructure. If your router is more than three years old, you probably need a new one that is compatible with today\u2019s faster, smarter wireless standards. If you are relying on a router provided by your broadband provider, you should probably buy a more powerful stand-alone router. Unused gadgets and power cables take up lots of space in drawers and attics. This e-waste would be better off sold or donated to someone in need, or recycled for their precious metals. There is bound to be unsellable e-junk in your pile. Fortunately, all Best Buy locations will take your used electronics and recycle them for free. Just bag the items up and drop them off at the store\u2019s customer-service counter, and the retailer will take care of the rest.Many deals that emerge throughout the year are as good, or better, than the ones on Black Friday. You just have to know how to spot them.Advertisement"}

Hair shirt or hair of the dog?For the purpose of this column, I\u2019ll divide hangover movies into two loose categories: \u201cWhat Am I Doing With My Life?\u201d and \u201cWell, That Wasn\u2019t So Bad, Was It?\u201d We\u2019ll begin with the first group. \u201cSmash-Up: The Story of a Woman,\u201d a 1947 movie starring Susan Hayward, who played an alcoholic as such in three pictures (and an implied one in a bunch more). The movie begins with Ms. Hayward in a hospital bed, three-fourths of her head bandaged up, repeating, \u201cI need a drink.\u201d It then flashes back to how she got that way. The movie has not aged well, in spite of its authentic portrait of alcohol abuse \u2014 the script was written in part by Dorothy Parker, who struggled with the same her whole life. (\u201cI\u2019ll Cry Tomorrow,\u201d the 1955 film in which Hayward plays the singer Lillian Roth, is the best of Hayward\u2019s pictures in this category but is not available on streaming video.) \u201cSmash-Up\u201d is available free to Amazon Prime members, but it\u2019s also in the public domain, which means it\u2019s on YouTube, undisturbed (a lot of the copyrighted material users post there is taken down by the copyright holders).

In the film, a father (Michael Shannon) rescues his young son (Jaeden Lieberher) from a cult and flees the authorities and angry zealots to keep the boy and his special powers safe.

The latest movie from the Coen Brothers concerns Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin), a studio fixer who cleans up after scandalous stars and saves his bosses from tabloid ruin.

{"Headline": "Democrats and Feds in Dispute on Trump\u2019s D.C. Hotel Lease", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "Supported byTransition Briefing\u25a0 The General Services Administration disputed House Democrats on President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s need to sell off his Washington hotel.\u25a0 Senators suggest Mr. Trump\u2019s pick for national security adviser may not be eligible for a security clearance.\u25a0 Senate Democrats to Betsy DeVos, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for education secretary: Pay the fines for your campaign finance violations.A spokeswoman for the G.S.A. came right back and said no, it hadn\u2019t.\u201cGSA does not have a position that the lease provision requires the President-elect to divest of his financial interests. We can make no definitive statement at this time about what would constitute a breach of the agreement, and to do so now would be premature. In fact, no determination regarding the Old Post Office can be completed until the full circumstances surrounding the President-elect\u2019s business arrangements have been finalized and he has assumed office.\u201dThat is quite a different characterization than the one House Democrats gave. They wrote:\u201cG.S.A. assesses that Mr. Trump will be in breach of the lease agreement the moment he takes office on Jan. 20, 2017, unless he fully divests himself of all financial interests in the lease for the Washington, D.C., hotel. The deputy commissioner made clear that Mr. Trump must divest himself not only of managerial control, but of all ownership interest as well.\u201dNo word yet from Mr. Trump about how he will proceed. Not even the G.S.A.\u2019s deputy commissioner of public building services has heard a peep in response.\u201cIn fact, the deputy commissioner informed our staffs that the G.S.A. has received no communications to date from Mr. Trump\u2019s business organization about this issue. This raises serious questions about how Mr. Trump plans to proceed.\u201dBut the G.S.A. is not exactly saying all is fine with the hotel. More like, let\u2019s wait until Mr. Trump is actually sworn in.Two Democratic senators are raising a new issue about Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for national security adviser: They are questioning whether he should be allowed to hold a security clearance, citing past investigations into charges that Mr. Flynn leaked classified information and into potential conflicts presented by a private intelligence firm he owns.His business, the Flynn Intel Group, has hazy ties to Middle Eastern countries and has appeared to lobby for the Turkish government, and that \u201ccreates potential for pressure, coercion and exploitation by foreign agents,\u201d the two senators, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, said in a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Office of Personnel Management.He also took a paid speaking engagement last year with Russia Today, a television network funded by the Kremlin, and sat next to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia at the network\u2019s lavish anniversary party in Moscow.In addition, Mr. Flynn was investigated, but cleared of any wrongdoing, in 2010 for sharing sensitive data with Pakistan about the Haqqani network, a faction of the Taliban, and for providing highly classified intelligence to British and Australian forces fighting in Afghanistan.But it is Mr. Flynn\u2019s business relationships that remain unresolved. He has said he plans to step back from the Flynn Intel Group and let his son, Michael G. Flynn, run it, according to the senators\u2019 letter, which was provided to The New York Times before its release on Wednesday.But that still does not settle the issue, the senators said.\u201cAny share of partnership profits he obtains from the Flynn Intel Group that are derived from its representation of a foreign government would appear to be a violation of his obligation as a retired general to abide by the emoluments clause of the constitution,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal and Ms. Shaheen wrote.Senate Democrats have found a new bit of leverage against Ms. DeVos, the Michigan Republican Party leader who will soon be considered for the cabinet post of education secretary: her unpaid fines for campaign finance violations.All Children Matter broke Ohio election law by illegally sending $870,000 from its national PAC to its Ohio affiliate. The state of Ohio levied a record fine against the group.But the debt remains unpaid, the senators said. And now a confirmation vote looms.Two billionaire Silicon Valley executives, Elon Musk of SpaceX and Tesla, and Travis Kalanick of Uber, joined Mr. Trump\u2019s roster of major American business advisers.The addition of Mr. Musk and Mr. Kalanick to Mr. Trump\u2019s Strategic and Policy Forum bring big technology names to the inner circle of Mr. Trump\u2019s transition that has had little engagement so far with Silicon Valley, except for the vocal support of the tech investor Peter Thiel.Mr. Musk and Mr. Kalanick engaged closely with the Obama administration, and their companies have increased their lobbying presence in Washington in recent years. Mr. Musk\u2019s electric car company, Tesla, and his other firms, including Solar City and SpaceX, have been criticized by rivals for using federal and state subsidies. Uber, Mr. Kalanick\u2019s ride-hailing business, has roiled the taxi industry and fought municipalities around the world for new regulations that allow it to operate.The forum, which includes the heads of Walt Disney and General Motors, will be led by Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chairman and co-founder of the investment firm the Blackstone Group, the Trump transition team announced Wednesday. The group is charged with providing Mr. Trump with their individual views on how regulations affect jobs and economic growth.Mr. Trump\u2019s relationship with the tech sector has been tense. His election was greeted with dismay by many in Silicon Valley, who supported the Trans Pacific Partnership trade agreement, the internet policy of net neutrality, and an increase in the immigration of highly skilled workers. Mr. Trump has promised to unroll all of those efforts.Mr. Trump singled out Apple for manufacturing parts of their devices abroad. He also criticized Amazon for its dominance, and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, for owning The Washington Post, which he said had been unfair in its campaign coverage of him.The announcement that Mr. Musk and Mr. Kalanick were joining his business policy group came ahead of a meeting with several tech leaders at Trump Tower on Wednesday, including Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer.To Mr. Trump, the job of the president is to focus on jobs. Virtually everything else is subservient to that: diplomacy, science, conservation.On Wednesday, he officially tapped former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas to lead the Department of Energy, an agency whose primary tasks are to maintain the safety and reliability of the nation\u2019s nuclear arsenal, counter nuclear proliferation, clean up Cold War radiation contamination and pursue basic science through the government\u2019s premier research laboratories.\u201cAs the governor of Texas, Rick Perry created created a business climate that produced millions of new jobs and lower energy prices in his state, and he will bring that same approach to our entire country as secretary of energy,\u201d said President-elect Trump. \u201cMy administration is going to make sure we take advantage of our huge natural resource deposits to make America energy independent and create vast new wealth for our nation.\u201dAfter a rally in Milwaukee on Tuesday night, he thanked Wisconsin and reiterated his jobs message.It is the prism through which his selection of the Exxon Mobil chief executive Rex W. Tillerson for secretary of state, the Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, and the fast-food executive Andrew F. Puzder for labor secretary should be seen.As Mr. Trump prepares to meet with Big Tech, 19 organizations from the music industry, including the Americana Music Association, sent him a letter expressing their concern about content theft over shared platforms.Mr. Trump is familiar with musicians\u2019 concerns about using music without permission \u2014 he was criticized during his campaign by artists who did not want their songs played at his rallies.Mr. Stepien is now the leading contender to be the White House political director.Two people close to the transition said that Mr. Stepien, who was hired by Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, after the final campaign shake-up, has been repeatedly mentioned for the role, although the decision is not final.Bridgegate aside, Mr. Stepien is credited by some of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest advisers with helping him improve his field organization in crucial states, and contributing to his victory.Mr. Trump has chosen (who else?) a television star to sing the national anthem at his inauguration on Jan. 20.Jackie Evancho, a 16-year-old singer who gained popularity as a contestant on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent,\u201d said on Wednesday that it was \u201ca great honor\u201d to be asked to perform by Mr. Trump.Ms. Evancho met Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago, his resort in Palm Beach, Fla., in 2011, after she had finished as the runner-up on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent,\u201d NBC\u2019s hit series. She was 10 at the time.\u201cI\u2019m so excited; it\u2019s going to be awesome,\u201d she said after making the announcement on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show.Ms. Evancho, of course, is too young to vote.One day after top congressional Republicans said an investigation was necessary, Ms. Pelosi questioned their conviction. \u201cThat\u2019s a statement of fact,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cThat\u2019s not a statement of action.\u201dShe said a panel of outside investigators with subpoena power needed to be convened.\u201cThe people have a right to know why Republicans are afraid of the truth,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said.Advertisement"}

Sonically, it\u2019s Best Coast in classic retro form, evoking a Phil Spector girl group; lyrically it\u2019s a boilerplate message about the power of imagination. \u201cDid you know, when you fall asleep,\u201d Bethany Cosentino sings, \u201cYou can be anything?\u201d She adds: \u201cDreams become reality/On Christmas, and everyday.\u201d N.C.Last year the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra released an album of recent highlights from Big Band Holidays, its seasonal concert program. This year, in addition to a 10-city tour, the band issued a limited-edition vinyl single in the shape of a Christmas tree. Side A features a surging arrangement of \u201cGod Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen,\u201d while Side B consists of a stylish \u201cLittle Drummer Boy.\u201d The playing is sharp and committed, and the holiday spirit is palpable. N.C.The gospel singer Kim Burrell hails from Houston, Tx., which also happens to be the hometown of the keyboardist and producer Robert Glasper. Their collaboration on this ubiquitous Christmas carol is a low-simmering stock, full of comfort and easy charisma. Ms. Burrell sings it entirely in the sweet spot of her range, never showing a trace of strain, and Mr. Glasper adds a sinuous R&B chord progression, with help from his regular band mates, the drummer Mark Colenburg and the bassist Derrick Hodge. N.C.There may not be a more insistent new ode to holiday escapism than the new song by Nellie McKay. It\u2019s a Christmas inducement to light up an aromatic botanical (not frankincense), arranged as a lite-reggae ditty. Ms. McKay sings the melody in tandem with the Minneapolis soul singer Maurice Jacox, and in the video she cheerfully takes her message to the streets of New York, costumed as a cannabis leaf. She can\u2019t help but insert some pointed commentary about the prison-industrial complex, but her main point is more lighthearted, at least on the surface. \u201cYou want the strife of humankind to finally cease?\u201d she raps. \u201cStart getting sublime on the peaceful leaf.\u201d N.C.This year\u2019s most joyfully raunchy holiday number, bar none. Unruly! J.C.Sufjan Stevens\u2019s \u201cSister Winter\u201d is a study in regret and estrangement that ends in holiday greetings; it starts out fragile and apologetic but turns hearty. The Silver Lake Chorus, which devises elaborate arrangements of indie-rock songs, makes it a communal a cappella piece full of ethereal oohs and ahs, making way for handclaps and la-las as it prettily revs up. The video clip captures the music-nerd charm of the project, with smiling, slightly rumpled, slightly gawky singers glancing away from the camera\u2019s long tracking shot in a white-walled house without a stick of furniture. J.P.Well, sooner or later someone had to realize that traditional minor-mode \u201cCarol of the Bells\u201d could align neatly with the cellos in the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d theme. The three French women who sing in L.E.J. (also known as Elijay) specialize in clever, precise mashups, and they execute this one neatly, harmonizing or trading phrases and switching between the carol and the theme. The merry tidings get a wry, ominous undercurrent. J.P.Low, a long-running indie-rock band from Duluth, often writes quiet songs that move in slow motion. But \u201cSome Hearts (at Christmas Time)\u201d is far eerier than usual. A lone electric guitar is picked slowly in a sustained electronic ambience, mostly a drone that\u2019s flecked with bits of voices run backwards. With gently keening vocals, the song works out a kind of emotional equation, gazing at peaceful hearts and ones that are tormented even at Christmastime with equally serene sympathy. J.P.Hip-hop holiday music enthusiasts have a bounty in the new compilation \u201cHip-Hop & R&B Christmas Gold,\u201d a set of unlikely seasonal music from a wide and not totally orderly range of rap stars and almost-stars. Take this borderline comic Onyx song about holiday hostility \u2014 \u201cSanta wanna know if i\u2019m naughty or nice/I\u2019m in the trap blowing trees with the 40s on ice.\u201d It\u2019s an encouragingly disruptive take on tradition, on a collection that also includes Cam\u2019ron, Camp Lo, Celly Cel(!) and the Ying Yang Twins. J.C.The Mexican singer Carla Morrison\u2019s six-track Christmas EP, \u201cLa Ni\u00f1a del Tambor,\u201d includes this new song among familiar ones. It\u2019s a prayer of gratitude and devotion, sung in her pristine soprano, building almost like a power ballad before returning to humility. J.P.On the plus side, we have arrived at the point where a New Orleans bounce song can be on the soundtrack of a mainstream Hollywood production (in this case, \u201cOffice Christmas Party\u201d). On the down side . . . well, let\u2019s not dwell on the details. Big Freedia does an effective translation of bounce bawdiness into holiday exuberance. And in the video, every square person who comes into the frame ends up a licentious reveler \u2014 Big Freedia\u2019s powers remain undimmed. J.C.Advertisement"}

Nine out of 10 Wall Street research analysts recommended that investors hold it in their portfolio, if not buy more.That same month, however, a different type of research firm downgraded Pfizer to its lowest rating, reflecting what it considered increased risks from factors that other Wall Street analysts typically ignore: environmental, social and corporate governance issues, or E.S.G.Investing based on so-called E.S.G. factors has mushroomed in recent years, driven in part by big pension funds and European money managers that are trying new ways to evaluate potential investments. The idea has changed over the last three decades from managers\u2019 simple exclusion from their portfolios of \u201csin stocks\u201d such as tobacco, alcohol and firearms makers to incorporation of E.S.G. analysis into their stock and bond picks.MSCI is perhaps better known for its global stock indexes, but its annual E.S.G. index and research revenues have been growing at 20 percent annually and should top $44 million this year, making the segment the firm\u2019s fastest-growing business.On Pfizer, MSCI\u2019s research noted the high volume of regulatory warnings that the company had received as of mid-2015, raising the risk of liability concerning five of its drugs. The downgrade caught Pfizer\u2019s attention, and its representatives met with MSCI officials to update them on legal issues like asbestos lawsuits, and about various drugs like Zoloft, Effexor and Protonix. MSCI kept its rating.The amount of assets managed using E.S.G. factors has more than tripled to $8.1 trillion since 2010, according to a report issued in November by the US SIF Foundation, which tracks sustainable investing. The TIAA-CREF Social Choice Equity Fund has doubled in size to a current $2.3 billion in the last five years. Exchange-traded funds linked to MSCI E.S.G. indexes have tripled to $3 billion in the last three years. And there has been a proliferation of E.S.G. index or research providers, including FTSE Russell, S&P Dow Jones Indices and Sustainalytics, which helps Morningstar rate mutual funds on their E.S.G. factors.Surveys have shown that younger investors like the approach. Calls for fossil-fuel divestment linked to climate-change concerns have also raised awareness. Even the regulatory climate has shifted: The Department of Labor ruled last year that investing fiduciaries could consider E.S.G. factors in their investment decisions as long as they did not hurt expected returns.Lisa Woll, chief executive of US SIF, said that even if a Trump administration \u201crolls back progress\u201d on some environmental and social issues, the field over all \u201cis likely to continue to grow based on demand by a wide range of investors.\u201dAssembled through acquisitions between 2009 and 2014, the MSCI E.S.G. ratings \u201chave come to be the market standard for E.S.G.,\u201d said Amy Orr, the director of capital markets at the Heron Foundation, which pursues an anti-poverty mission.On a recent morning last month, standing before a computer screen elevated by black metal stilts for videoconferencing, Ms. Lee conducted calls with MSCI analysts in Mumbai, Tokyo, Beijing and Massachusetts to consider a few possible ratings changes.They first considered whether a Chinese steel company, Fosun International, should be upgraded because it was moving into financial services and would have lower exposure to toxic emissions. \u201cWe approve, including the rating upgrade. Thanks, Xiaoshu,\u201d Ms. Lee said to her analyst.Next was a downgrade of ENN Energy Holdings, a natural gas pipeline distributor in China that had carbon emission issues and what a utility analyst in Tokyo, Kenji Watanabe, called a \u201cweak board composition.\u201d But a downgrade was deferred for Bollor\u00e9 S.A. \u2014 a French transportation company that recently had a rail accident that killed 79 in Cameroon \u2014 pending an MSCI effort to reach the company.The MSCI ratings do not exclude all stocks in any given category, such as fossil fuels or tobacco, but rather rank each company against its peers based on how it manages E.S.G. risks.In oil and gas, for example, the Norwegian giant Statoil ranks near the top based partly on its record of spills and low emissions, while the American company Chevron ranks near the bottom with higher-risk operations, including forced shutdowns this year of a new $54 billion liquefied natural gas plant in Australia.The building blocks for MSCI\u2019s E.S.G. research came from acquisitions that included a governance ratings firm co-founded by Robert Monks, a pioneer in shareholder activism, and a socially responsible stock research firm, KLD Research & Analytics, which introduced the Domini 400 Social Index in 1990.The goal, Mr. Monks said in a recent interview, is to \u201capply something akin to classical security analysis to areas which have so far escaped consideration in valuing companies.\u201dPerformance does not have to suffer. Although the TIAA-CREF social choice fund and the flagship MSCI exchange-traded fund have trailed the market slightly for the last five years, the Vanguard fund has topped it. The $14.8 billion Parnassus Core Equity Investor fund, which picks stocks using E.S.G. and fundamental analysis, has beaten the market by more than two percentage points annually over the last 10 years.As E.S.G. becomes more popular, companies have become more responsive to MSCI\u2019s data-gathering efforts. Ms. Lee said the response rate had risen from about 15 percent in 2013 to a current 40 percent. Pfizer, for example, first got in touch with MSCI in 2014.The TIAA-CREF social choice fund, which aims to invest in E.S.G. leaders, does not hold several well-known stocks based partly on unfavorable MSCI ratings. Among those excluded are Exxon Mobil (for environmental impact management), Apple (labor-management relations and supply chain issues), Facebook (privacy and data security), Amazon (labor-management practices), and General Electric (labor-management practices, military contracting, weapons).With undergraduate and Ph.D. degrees from Harvard, Ms. Lee came to MSCI through the 2010 acquisition of RiskMetrics Group, owner of the Innovest sustainability research firm. Operating from a 48th-floor glass-walled aerie opposite One World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan, she oversees 150 analysts who follow 6,500 companies in 14 offices worldwide.Some investors find data from MSCI and others helpful as a starting point beyond the narrower E.S.G. agenda. \u201cIt really helps us quickly understand whether there are business controversies or other risks \u2014 and opportunities,\u201d said Karina Funk, a co-manager of the $360 million Brown Advisory Sustainable Growth fund.For example, she said, her firm bought stock in American Tower, a cellular tower company, after Brown\u2019s own research found its tower-siting practices exceed standards set by environmental regulators or wildlife management groups, \u201cmaking them a preferred partner.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Daily Report: Google\u2019s Renewable Cloud", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byBitsThe next cat video you play on YouTube may help the green energy industry.To be clear, Google, which owns YouTube, will not be only consuming renewables: Its massive data centers are on big electric grids, which take power from a number of sources, including coal. Google arranges to have renewable sources on those grids, so that its net consumption isn\u2019t drawing down additional carbon-based power.In fact, in many cases it is buying more wind and solar power than it uses, because Google is still having a hard time developing those sources in Asia. As a result, it overprovisions in places like North America and Europe, where there are more wind turbines.This is a big deal for a couple of reasons. For one, most of the growth in industrial power consumption is from data centers, and Google, along with companies like Microsoft and Amazon, is building global cloud computing centers at an unprecedented clip.Some of the companies have been hit by environmentalists for not being green, and now all three companies are trying to be better corporate citizens, in terms of their consumption.Google also makes much of its efficient power usage inside its data centers. For this story, I went to Oklahoma, where a 50,000-acre wind farm generates power for the same grid where Google operates its second-largest computer complex in North America, a plot of eight large buildings not far from the Arkansas border.Inside the facility, Google has a lot of clever ways to reuse water, and bring outside air to cool its computer servers. In terms of power usage effectiveness, Google\u2019s computing plant uses almost all the power it takes in to run its machines \u2014 not long ago, computer centers used just half the power they brought in.Individual machines typically waste 30 percent of the power they take; Google\u2019s computers waste 10 percent to 15 percent.Google may be trying to give the planet one big green hug here, but that doesn\u2019t mean the company isn\u2019t also looking out for the main chance. The green announcement is good public relations, and may spur other big companies to use more wind and solar. The industry is young enough that it\u2019s still finding economies of scale, so more consumers could lower Google\u2019s future acquisition costs.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Wishing Away the Wish List", "Date": "2016-12-16", "News": "Supported byTiesI\u2019ve buried my phone at the bottom of my purse so I can try to ignore the calls, emails and texts from well-meaning relatives, all of whom are asking: Where is the Christmas list?They want suggestions for what to give the kids, the more specific the better. If I say, \u201cMaybe a Lego set?\u201d they\u2019ll ask, \u201cWhich one?\u201dI think it\u2019s about longing: to be taken care of, to let someone else do at least part of the planning. I may be an adult, but some part of me still has a child\u2019s desire to wake up, starry-eyed, and find that gifts have materialized under the tree \u2014 surprises chosen with love and obtained in secret, waiting to be opened in wonder. We don\u2019t outgrow that.Then there\u2019s the guilt, of course. I suspect our relatives wouldn\u2019t need ideas for what to give our children if I did a better job of keeping in touch during the rest of the year. If we visited more often \u2014 if I were a better daughter and sister \u2014 they\u2019d know all my kids\u2019 hobbies and wishes, and I would know theirs. (I haven\u2019t asked anyone what to give them this year. I hope they don\u2019t hate their gifts, but I really do enjoy putting a little imagination into it.)This is also a practical matter. To compile an itemized inventory of wished-for things and divvy it up among grandparents and aunts and uncles would require time, of which I have no surplus. Tonight, for example, I have four events to attend \u2014 two optional-but-encouraged work functions, a fund-raiser for my children\u2019s school, and an already rescheduled social gathering. I don\u2019t know if our 13-year-old son\u2019s soccer game will finish in time for the first event or at what point in the evening my husband\u2019s meeting will let out so that he can come home to watch our 10-year-old daughter.I don\u2019t know what anyone\u2019s going to eat for dinner or when, much less what everyone\u2019s getting for Christmas.Where\u2019s the line between writing a letter to the North Pole and forking over an itemized file of material desires? The former seems sweet; the latter feels like handing someone a grocery list.Plus, if you ask only for things you know exist, how will you ever be delighted by something you couldn\u2019t have fathomed?Still, it\u2019s my job as a parent to orchestrate all the steps that make Christmas look like magic, and that means I have to make the decisions. We\u2019re lucky to have family who love our kids, who want to do something nice for them, and I know it\u2019s ungrateful not to return their calls. So I dig the phone out of my purse.\u201cAnything is fine, really,\u201d I try to tell my mom. \u201cThey like everything. Maybe clothes?\u201d\u201cThat doesn\u2019t help me,\u201d she says.That\u2019s when I realize she\u2019s feeling some variation of the same thing I am: Help me. Make this easier, please. Tell me what to do.At the end of the school day, my daughter climbs into the car. Thanks to her brother\u2019s sports schedule, she has done homework on bleachers and back seats for three of the past four nights. \u201cWhat\u2019s for dinner?\u201d she asks.\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat are you in the mood for?\u201d\u201cWhatever,\u201d she says. \u201cYou pick.\u201dShe wants me to decide. I want someone else to decide. My mother wants me to decide. We don\u2019t grow out of this either, apparently.I make a decision: No events tonight. Not one, not two, not three, not four. I make the calls and beg off. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I wish I could come.\u201d And it\u2019s true; I wish I could be many places at once. But I can\u2019t.We go to the soccer game. We come home. I make spaghetti. Father and son hang out after homework and talk about whether the deer in our yard have enough to eat when it turns cold. My daughter and I share a blanket on the sofa.

Two other airline employees were detained but later released, it added.The arrests indicated that the inquiry into the crash, which left only six survivors and stunned the region, was widening. Investigators also said they had seized files from the offices of the airline.Carlos Jaime Taborga, a Colombian prosecutor, said investigators hoped to determine exactly \u201cwho is responsible for this tragedy so that they pay the price.\u201dInvestigators also said they were looking into the role of Celia Castedo, an airline official at the Santa Cruz airport, who has fled to Brazil. In records leaked to Bolivian news media, Ms. Castedo is said to have advised the pilot of the plane against flying to Medell\u00edn on the grounds that the distance was too far. The plane was allowed to take off, despite the concerns.Bolivian officials said this week that that they were seeking Ms. Castedo\u2019s extradition.

The idea that a critic can watch all the television there is today, let alone isolate the 10 best works among wildly different genres, is a fiction. But play along with it, and you tell a larger tale about what mattered that year and why.What remains is a sampler of TV as dizzying and agitated as the year we\u2019ve just lived through. We live in interesting times, and we also get to watch them. \u2014 JAMES PONIEWOZIKNot that long ago, making a list of the best international shows on American television would have been as easy, and pointless, as reprinting the PBS \u201cMasterpiece\u201d schedule. That handful of British imports was essentially the only foreign programming available.But like everything else in TV, that\u2019s changed. My initial list for this first international Top 10 contained more than 80 shows, and that was a small slice of the foreign series available on TV or streaming services in 2016.A few notes. Five of the 11 shows on the list are British comedies. That might seem excessive, but it reflects my feeling that some of the best, most imaginative work in the world is being done in that place and genre. (Also the most energetic. American sitcoms are at a peak, too, but the best ones tend to have a muted, distressed energy \u2014 the sheer vitality of the Britcoms can be a welcome relief.)There\u2019s also an overall Anglo- and Eurocentrism to the list. That\u2019s partly because American programmers still overwhelmingly favor English-language shows, though streaming services do make a wealth of non-Western series available. So why no Korean or Chinese dramas, for instance? Because as attractive as some of them are, I still can\u2019t reconcile myself to the saccharine and melodramatic formulas that seem to be mandatory in their original markets.Finally, five of the 11 entries were first shown in the United States by Netflix. Whether it\u2019s a matter of taste or of aggressiveness and large acquisition budgets, no one matches Netflix in the breadth and quality of its international offerings, beginning with my No. 1 show. \u2014 MIKE HALEWho has benefited most from the explosion of television offerings in the last decade or so? I would argue that it has been people whose tastes in humor run toward the bizarre, the scathing and the incongruous. Television had long decades when \u201cout there\u201d meant \u201cMy Mother the Car\u201d or \u201cRowan & Martin\u2019s Laugh-In.\u201d Eventually shows like \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d began pushing matters of taste, and now, with entire channels and streaming services devoted to outlandish comedy, there are shows unpredictable enough, scalding enough or ribald enough for almost any skewed funny bone. Of the new ones that turned up in 2016, here are my favorite 10. \u2014 NEIL GENZLINGERMore highlights from the year, as chosen by our critics:Advertisement"}

We knew the Thing was going to be big, but we didn\u2019t know it would be this big. When the Thing threatened to eat up all the gadgets, nobody thought it would really happen. We still had hope that some gadgets would stick around.Much of this isn\u2019t a surprise. \u201cHardware is hard\u201d is an actual phrase that people in Silicon Valley say to pass for wise. What they mean is, starting a company that makes physical stuff has always been more perilous than starting a company that just makes code.That\u2019s why the hardware market has recently been ruled by big companies, either as stand-alone businesses for the likes of Apple and Samsung, or as a kind of come-on for other services. Amazon makes devices like the Kindle and the Echo as an accelerant to its content businesses and its Prime subscription program. Google and Microsoft appear more serious about hardware, and they both might turn devices into nice side businesses. But neither sees hardware as a primary moneymaker; the devices are mainly ways to get us to use more of their software.For start-ups, even in these days of easy contract manufacturing in China, gadgets involve a lot of costs \u2014 you need money for parts and a factory, and shipping and distribution, and you need virtually everything to go perfectly, because if your first gadget is a bust or has some fatal bug, you won\u2019t have a lot of money to make a second one. And even if your gadget is a success, it won\u2019t last long. The gadget economy is hits driven \u2014 you\u2019re only as good as your next big thing.And once you get a hit, you\u2019ll get hit by cheap knockoffs. Just before I went on a trip to Hawaii last year, I thought it would be fun to get a GoPro camera to record some pool stunts. But when I searched Amazon.com, I noticed a ton of generic \u201caction cameras\u201d that carried many of the same specs as the GoPros, at a steep discount on price. I ended up buying an SJCAM for $75, about half the price of the cheapest GoPro I could find. And you know what? It worked pretty well.This is the mixed blessing of cheaper manufacturing. \u201cIn some ways it\u2019s much easier to be a hardware start-up than it ever was before, because the Shenzhen ecosystem gives you all the components you need,\u201d said Jan Dawson, an analyst at Jackdaw Research, referring to the manufacturing hub Shenzhen, in southern China. \u201cBut that same ecosystem is available to everybody else, too, so setting yourself apart is really tough.\u201dYou might point out that the SJCAM I purchased lacked some of the finer qualities of a GoPro. Its software wasn\u2019t great, and it didn\u2019t offer customer support. If I were an extreme sports enthusiast, I might have cared about those deficiencies. For years, after all, GoPro managed to do very well among its niche audience of people who ride bikes in the snow while drinking Mountain Dew, or whatever it is you do when you\u2019re Xtreme. Other manufacturers tapped other niches \u2014 there are gadgets for running, hiking, walking and several other sports.But Mr. Dawson noted that eventually these companies reach the limit of their natural niche. Every sports enthusiast already has a GoPro \u2014 and that\u2019s when trouble begins. Because I\u2019m more of an extreme Twitter enthusiast than extreme sports guy, and because for me every gadget is essentially just an accessory to my smartphone, the cheaper knockoffs are usually fine for my purposes. This is likely to be the case for you, too.There is something sad about this. The gadget marketplace is the great laboratory of new tech. Gadget start-ups feed the entire tech ecosystem with new ideas. It\u2019s thanks to Pebble that we first saw the latent demand for smartwatches, and thanks to GoPro we realized that people really wanted to take videos of themselves doing underwater handstands. Would we ever have had the iPod if a bunch of start-ups in the late 1990s hadn\u2019t braved legal trouble to create portable MP3 players?But new stuff? Stuff we haven\u2019t seen before? Gadgets? They\u2019re gone.Advertisement"}

His movies contain violence, sometimes of the grisly kind, but he doesn\u2019t go for the constant semiautomatic, conviction-free sadism that distinguishes the \u201cSaw\u201d franchise and other movies. He also doesn\u2019t go for the arguably cheap \u201cjump scares\u201d that are a feature of many contemporary horror pictures.But it won\u2019t do to call him old-fashioned. He\u2019s doing new things. The parallel editing of \u201cOculus,\u201d portraying his characters as young children and young adults in shifting flashbacks and flash-forwards that become increasingly complex as the movie progresses, is innovative. In \u201cHush,\u201d the way he uses movie language to change perspectives \u2014 from the deaf heroine to the hearing outside world \u2014 is similarly inventive. (\u201cHush\u201d was written by Mr. Flanagan and his lead actress, Kate Siegel, who were married this year.)While he worked with celluloid only briefly while studying film at Towson University in Maryland, Mr. Flanagan said in a phone interview that whatever platform they\u2019re going to be viewed on, he wanted his movies to feel like \u2026 movies. \u201cWith digital technology there\u2019s a huge spectrum of flexibility in what you can do to manipulate sound and image,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich you can push into a really artificial realm if you aren\u2019t careful.\u201dMr. Flanagan, who is in his mid-30s, mentioned \u201cJaws\u201d as a picture that showed him \u201cwhat cinema can do\u201d and also cited horror classics like \u201cThe Changeling,\u201d \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d and \u201cThe Shining\u201d as influences. He said the 1940s movies of the producer Val Lewton (\u201cCat People\u201d) gave him an appreciation of atmosphere.\u201cA movie studio has to answer to a marketing department, and to shareholders, to ensure the broadest audience possible for its product; it tends to err on the side of caution as a result,\u201d he said. \u201cNetflix has an incredible bravery about things that just don\u2019t excite a studio anymore. You can feel the excitement they have about just getting a project into production.\u201c\u2018Gerald\u2019s Game,\u2019 we could not have made it at a studio without substantive changes to the story. Working in this way takes away a lot of the red tape that you\u2019d have to machete your way through in the studio system.\u201dIs there any downside? \u201cThe question is how long that attitude can survive the bigger the company becomes, but I haven\u2019t seen any signs of it flagging,\u201d Mr. Flanagan said. Netflix will probably release \u201cGerald\u2019s Game\u201d in the spring. Mr. Flanagan said the service may want to give it some festival exposure before offering it to subscribers.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Donald Trump Summons Tech Leaders to a Round-Table Meeting", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported bySilicon Valley shunned the Republican candidate and all he stood for. It mobilized its technology for his defeat and warned of dire consequences if he should somehow win.Now that the impossible has happened, tech\u2019s day of reckoning is here \u2014 next Wednesday afternoon, to be precise. The president-elect is summoning leaders of the biggest tech companies to New York for a round-table discussion, according to a transition official who has seen the invitations.The agenda is undisclosed and perhaps still under consideration, but it is unlikely to produce the sort of love fest that existed between President Obama and Silicon Valley. Tech culture celebrates disruption as the tool that produces a better future for all. Many of Donald J. Trump\u2019s supporters, on the other hand, see it as pushing them down.Two Silicon Valley chief executives appeared willing to test the waters: Safra Catz, of the software maker Oracle, confirmed her participation in next week\u2019s meeting with Mr. Trump. So did Chuck Robbins of Cisco Systems, the networking gear maker.Representatives for other leading tech companies, including Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Google and Apple, declined to comment. A Trump spokeswoman did not immediately reply to a request for comment.Mr. Thiel has said in interviews that the benefits accruing to tech investors like himself should be more widely shared outside a few ZIP codes in New York and around San Francisco. One role of the meeting is to spur ideas for changing this situation. A spokesman for Mr. Thiel declined to comment.In Apple\u2019s case, Mr. Trump has said he told its chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, in late November that he wants the company to build \u201ca big plant\u201d in the United States \u2014 or even better, \u201cmany big plants.\u201dApple itself does not do any manufacturing in the United States. A contractor, Flex, manufactures high-end desktop computers on its behalf in Austin, Tex., employing about 2,000 people. A vast majority of Apple\u2019s production is in China, where there is an enormous ecosystem devoted to it. Many economists say that reproducing such an interlocking web of suppliers here would push the cost of iPhones up considerably.Mr. Trump also tangled with Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, during the campaign, saying that Mr. Bezos has \u201ca huge antitrust problem because he\u2019s controlling so much.\u201dIf there are some overtures being made in Silicon Valley, there are also some lines being drawn.Chris Sacca, a prominent venture investor, said there was only one path for those attending next week\u2019s meeting: defiance.\u201cIf an attendee wants to maintain their integrity and preserve their company\u2019s ability to recruit the best talent, then there is only one purpose for a trip to Trump Tower: to deliver the message that our industry will not be complicit in the systematic disgrace of our democratic institutions, the establishment of an authoritarian kleptocracy nor the oppression of citizens, including the minority of Americans who elected him,\u201d Mr. Sacca said.Or perhaps everyone will get along fine. Some in Silicon Valley speculate that the rough moments between Mr. Trump and the tech industry come not because they are so different but because they are at the bottom so similar.\u201cTrump embodies the harsher aspects of Silicon Valley \u2014 a brash and arrogant disrupter, convinced that the world is all wrong as it is and only he can change it for the better,\u201d said Shiva Ramesh, a longtime Silicon Valley entrepreneur.Even Mr. Trump\u2019s ambitious-yet-vague plans have a familiar ring. \u201cSounds like the pitch of some start-ups: \u2018It is all there in my head and in a one-page plan, it will all work out, I can do it, trust me,\u2019\u201d Mr. Ramesh said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Got an Hour? See the Met These 4 Ways", "Date": "2016-12-08", "News": "50-Minute CriticThe collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art holds a number of remarkable depictions of powerful women. Here\u2019s our 50-minute critic\u2019s guide.Supported byNew Yorkers live booked-up lives, and tourists are the busiest people in town. Who else dashes in beat-the-clock time from the World Trade Center to Rockefeller Center, to Trump Tower to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, pausing for selfies at each stop?And when you hit the Met with your meter running, what can you do? The place is huge; ridiculous. Macy\u2019s, but more. So you have a decision to make. If you restrict yourself to a special show, or a gallery or two, you\u2019ll be able to see some art in a focused way, though you\u2019ll miss the breadth that makes the Met so awesome. If you opt to cover a lot of ground fast, you\u2019ll get the lay of the land, but as a drive-by blur.Let me propose a compromise: a thematic tour, or set of tours, that would take in the multicultural mix of a great global museum, but selectively, in a purposefully hopscotching way, with an eye on the clock; tours that would last somewhere under an hour, the span of a workday lunch break.Don\u2019t be overwhelmed by over 6,000 years of history at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. We\u2019re here to help.In the future, The New York Times will apply this model to several museums, in and out of the city, only a few of them Met-size. But I\u2019ll start with my home museum, and I\u2019ll take as a shaping theme images both of, and by, women in the collection, specifically women of power, with power expansively defined. The choice is partly inspired by a moment in time that might have given us our first female president, and gave instead a woman-baiting president-elect. It\u2019s also a personal choice. Images of, and by, women are some of the most beautiful and complex in the museum.Even with a thematic frame, organizing a tour is tricky. It would be nice to follow a neat chronological route, but the Met isn\u2019t laid out that way. Nor, for that matter, is history: Timelines of art in different cultures don\u2019t run on parallel tracks; at any given point, forms of art that were hot in Europe were irrelevant in, say, China, and vice versa. And again, with the Met, there\u2019s the inventory issue: unmanageable tons of stuff to consider, even within a theme.So we\u2019ll break the tour up into subthematic mini-tours. Some will have you speed-walking the museum\u2019s length and breadth (it covers nearly 14 acres); others will keep you more or less in one place. All will require the same gear: soft soles, minimal luggage and a floor map, with all galleries numbered, available at the Met\u2019s information desks. And you\u2019re off.You can start with ancient and monumental. Enter the Egyptian Wing from the Great Hall, on the first floor, and head straight back. It\u2019s a hike, but sensationally scenic, taking you past wall reliefs, mummies and the fragmentary head of a New Kingdom queen cut from honey-yellow jasper and glowing like a lantern, till you come to Gallery 115, devoted entirely to images of one person, the female pharaoh Hatshepsut.She ascended the throne around 1478 B.C. as regent for a toddler-age nephew, declared herself king and ruled, effectively solo, for more than 20 productive years.During that time, she kept the peace, revived Egyptian trade and commissioned major art and architectural projects, including countless sculptures of herself. The gallery has several. In the largest she has the leonine masculine bulk that was considered the monarchic ideal. But in the center of the gallery, set up as a cross between throne room and a chapel, she sits, nearly life-size, carved in pale stone, looking youthful and lithe in a sleek sheath dress.Works melding features of goddess and queen stretch across cultures and account for some of the Met\u2019s most glamorous images. Dash upstairs to Gallery 240 in the Met\u2019s Asian Wing and you\u2019ll find another in a fabulous South Indian bronze temple sculpture of the goddess Parvat, her arms like vines, her hands like flowers. Or sprint the length of the museum to Gallery 352 of the Africa, Oceania and Americas collection and take in a superb 16th-century ivory pendant mask owned by a Benin king in Nigeria. It\u2019s a portrait of his mother, a queen, and he wore it as if it were a combination of searchlight, shield and talisman.Near it, in Gallery 357, is a breath-catching recent addition to the collection, an arched and turreted gold repouss\u00e9 crown, studded with emeralds, from Spanish colonial Colombia. It was made for a statue of the Virgin in her role as Queen of Heaven. Glowing in church candlelight, she must have been an imperious sight, though not all her images are so regal. A short walk away in the museum\u2019s Medieval Hall is one that conveys the opposite impression.Isolated in an inconspicuous spot near a door, and indifferently lighted, it\u2019s a sculpture of the Virgin Enthroned from 12th-century Scandinavia. Just under three feet tall, cut from a piece of poplar, she has the recessive, round-shouldered posture of a shy adolescent and the large-eyed face of a dove. She\u2019s one of my usual destinations in the museum. I often check in with her, say hello.Were it not for her veil, the Virgin Enthroned could be male or female, boy or girl. She\u2019s a reminder of how much religious art can look gender-fluid or gender-free. That\u2019s the story with Hatshepsut. (A current show at the Brooklyn Museum, \u201cA Woman\u2019s Afterlife: Gender Transformation in Ancient Egypt,\u201d addresses the subject.) And it\u2019s true of the much-loved Buddhist deity Avalokiteshvara, who appears in a female manifestation given the name Guanyin in China. The Met\u2019s Chinese collection has several examples, including, in Galley 208, a marvelous wood-carved one notable for its voluptuous torso, tapering fingers and calm-beyond-calm hauteur.For their part, the ancient Greeks had Amazons \u2014 not divine maybe, but gender-challenging, for sure. Herodotus claimed they wore trousers, packed arms and hunted men. To the xenophobic Greeks, they were the original Nasty Women, an embodiment of the Other, despised and feared. But they had attractions, too, evident in \u201cWounded Amazon\u201d in Gallery 153. A Roman marble copy of a Greek bronze, it\u2019s of a strappingly handsome woman in a skimpy chiton. She has taken a hit in battle but is still on her feet, bearing her pain with a defiant indifference that the sculptor clearly admires.Images of warrior women are relatively rare at the Met, though you\u2019ll see a couple of thrilling ones in a loan survey of paintings by the 17th-century French artist Valentin de Boulogne on the second floor, in Gallery 999. The pictures, with their David Lynch lighting, both depict the Jewish heroine Judith, who leveraged her sexual charms to gain access to and decapitate the Assyrian general Holofernes. In one picture, we see her slicing through his neck with a sword. (Artemisia Gentileschi also painted this scene.) In another, Judith, deed done, lifts a hand in an air pump as if to say \u201cScore!\u201dFiercer-looking, though benign, is the female figure in a 17th-century Mughal manuscript painting called \u201cGoddess Bhairavi Devi With Shiva,\u201d in Gallery 463 of the Islamic Wing on the same floor. It, too, is of a decapitation: the Great Goddess, fire-red with rage, seems to be cutting up a male corpse, head first. But as her devotees would know, her fury is a purposeful illusion. She\u2019s an aspect of the god Shiva, creator and destroyer, an entranced male version of whom sits nearby. The goddess may appear to be going ballistic, but it serves the cosmic balance, for which the positive charge of female energy is indispensable.In secular portraiture, supernatural power translates into force of personality. The Met has charismatic examples, of and by women. Many are in the European Painting galleries; several are audience favorites.Johannes Vermeer\u2019s \u201cStudy of a Young Woman\u201d (circa 1665) in Gallery 632 is one. It isn\u2019t exactly a portrait, but like his \u201cGirl With a Pearl Earring,\u201d it\u2019s a made-for-the-market image of the fashionable type, an \u201cit girl\u201d of the day. Here, the subject\u2019s shaved eyebrows and plucked hairline give her the slightly amphibious look of an E. T. Rembrandt\u2019s \u201cWoman With a Pink,\u201d two rooms away, is more certainly a portrait, though it, too, suggests an illustrative dimension: It catches the moving shadow of age in action.Age is a phenomenon that the 16th-century Italian realist Giovanni Battista Moroni embraces in his extraordinarily candid portrait of the middle-aged Abbess Lucrezia Agliardi Vertova, hanging in Gallery 608. And it\u2019s a reality that the 18th-century French salon painter Ad\u00e9la\u00efde LaBille-Guiard defies in her majestically assured \u201cSelf-Portrait With Two Pupils: Marie Gabrielle Capet and Marie Marguerite Carreaux de Rosemond,\u201d in Gallery 613.The LaBille-Guiard picture is above all a tribute to female artists, generations of them. So, in this gallery, is Marie Denise Villers\u2019s backlighted portrait of the young Marie Jos\u00e9phine Charlotte du Val d\u2019Ognes sitting with a sketch board and interrupted at work. It\u2019s a portrait of a female artist, by a female artist whose older artist-sister was a contemporary of LaBille-Guiard.Over in the American Wing, in Gallery 764, Thomas Eakins\u2019s \u201cThe Artist\u2019s Wife and His Setter Dog\u201d is, in its ambiguous way, a tribute to a female artist, too. From the 1880s, it\u2019s a portrait of Susan MacDowell Eakins, who had been the painter\u2019s student at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, had married him and weathered the scandal that engulfed him \u2014 he insisted on nude models, male and female, in his class \u2014 and led to his being fired.Whatever the tenor of their marriage, it sapped her ambitions for painting. She gave up art to promote Eakins\u2019s career, and only returned to it after his death. The Met has one of her early pictures, \u201cWoman Reading,\u201d but it\u2019s not in the galleries. It hangs chockablock with the numerous other second-tier items in open storage on the American Wing mezzanine, dim behind thick plexiglass and hard to find.It\u2019s an image \u2014 you get the sense that Stein\u2019s personality forced it out of Picasso \u2014 of a woman thinking critically. In a different way, Florine Stettheimer\u2019s \u201cCathedrals of Wall Street\u201d (1939) a few rooms away, with its insouciant image of the financial district, the capitalist heart of the nation, packed with preening politicians and soldiers, is the product of an artist painting critically. So is Alma Thomas\u2019s \u201cRed Roses Sonata\u201d from 1972, an abstract view of nature as a gorgeous but tattered curtain of red and blue.Thomas\u2019s painting is in Gallery 923, near the museum\u2019s southwest corner, all those acres away from Hatshepsut\u2019s room. And if during your tour you\u2019ve tracked down and stayed with even a fraction of the images of and by women en route, lunchtime is long over; it\u2019s probably too late to go back to the office, and your travel group has moved on and left you behind. So you might as well stay and look further: for an ancient Greek oil jug with paintings of women spinning yarn; a Zandra Rhodes wedding dress, pure \u201970s punk; for an exquisite willow basket by the Native American artist Datsolalee, patterned with dancing flames. The more you look, the more there is. So keep touring till closing time.Yes, you can dash around checking the boxes of traditional highlights as you peer at this El Greco or that Goya, and, of course, the Temple of Dendur. Here is what the 50-Minute Critic recommends instead.GODDESSES AND QUEENSFour stops on two floors, heavy on sculpture, taking in Egyptian art on the first floor; Asian works directly above on the second; then back to the first floor, but at the opposite end of the museum for African art; and finally, in the middle of the first floor, a straight line from the museum entrance, the Medieval Hall.SHIFTING GENDERSTwo stops: the Asian galleries on the second floor and the Greek and Roman galleries at the opposite end, on the first.VIOLENT FEMMESA quick and bloody tour in two stops, both on the second floor: Gallery 999, a special exhibition space near the European Paintings, and, in an attraction of geographical opposites, the Islamic Wing.PORTRAITS OF AND BY WOMENThree stops, all on the second floor, all featuring paintings. Start in European Paintings and then head next door to the American Wing and then back through the European galleries to the Modern and Contemporary Wing.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified the artist who painted \u201cJudith with the Head of Holofernes\u201d and \u201cAllegory of Italy.\u201d He was Valentin de Boulogne, not Artemisia Gentileschi.Advertisement"}

Without addressing the specifics of the case, Amazon said in a statement that, as a matter of course, it \u201cobjects to overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands.\u201dDetective Cpl. Josh Woodhams of the Bentonville Police Department wrote in an affidavit that he found an Amazon Echo on the home\u2019s kitchen counter. The voice-activated device has seven microphones, and is equipped with sensors to hear users from any direction up to about 20 feet. Among other things, it can play music, make to-do lists, stream podcasts and provide real-time news and information.In February, Mr. Bates was charged with murder, and as part of the investigation, the police sought from Amazon \u201celectronic data in the form of audio recordings, transcribed words, text records and other data\u201d captured by the Echo.The request has raised concern among some right-to-privacy supporters.Once it detects the wake word, according to Amazon, the Echo starts streaming audio to the cloud, where it is secured until the customer permanently deletes it.The case raises \u201cserious privacy concerns with this kind of nonspecific warrant,\u201d Ms. Terwoerds said, adding, \u201cWe have to fight against the myth of Echo listening in on our every word and sending that data to Amazon \u2014 it\u2019s simply untrue.\u201dJon Simpson, the police chief in Bentonville, which, by car, is about three hours northwest of Little Rock, referred questions to Nathan Smith, the prosecuting attorney in Benton County. In an email, Mr. Smith said Amazon had yet to fully comply with two requests, although he said it had provided \u201csome very limited subscriber information.\u201dWhile many right-to-privacy supporters have expressed interest in the request, Mr. Smith said the case was \u201c really about seeking justice for the victim.\u201d He added that it was the responsibility of the police to seek the data to determine its relevance to the investigation.

{"Headline": "Fates in Filmmaking: Who Were the Wallflowers at the \u2018La La Land\u2019 Dance?", "Date": "2016-12-01", "News": "Supported byOscar HuntThey almost didn\u2019t get them.\u201cLa La Land,\u201d directed and written by Damien Chazelle, would have been a big deal for both young stars. Ms. Watson had been keen to finally discard her Hogwarts uniform. For Mr. Teller, the musical would have been a move toward above-the-title leading man territory.But the movie gods had other plans \u2014 offering a prime example, as Hollywood hurtles into its annual awards hoopla, of the messy confluence of ephemeral factors that make some films sizzle.Mr. Teller, now 29, and Ms. Watson, 26, may well have mustered the chemistry necessary to pull off the wistful romance at the center of \u201cLa La Land.\u201d We\u2019ll never know. What is clear: Their departures (hers involving a competing project, his pertaining to scheduling and pay) were nonetheless kismet for Mr. Chazelle, who was able to land Mr. Gosling and Ms. Stone, who had been his dream pair but were initially unattainable.She added: \u201cYou can be as meticulous a filmmaker as there ever was. It\u2019s the accidents that make art. It\u2019s why you can\u2019t manufacture great films. If we could, Hollywood would be churning them out.\u201dThe creative push and pull of moviemaking, where one decision among thousands can make the difference between a critical hit and a miss, is on display all year long, of course. But the film industry\u2019s awards season, which will become supercharged on Dec. 12, when nominations for the 2017 Golden Globes are announced, has a way of throwing the happenstance aspects of cinema into high relief. Along with \u201cLa La Land,\u201d perhaps the best example this time around is \u201cManchester by the Sea.\u201dA drama about a hard-bitten New Englander (Casey Affleck) coping with horrendous loss, \u201cManchester by the Sea\u201d has received some of the best reviews of the year \u2014 and it almost starred Matt Damon, who had to bow out because of scheduling conflicts. As a result, Mr. Affleck may nab his second Oscar nomination. His first came in 2008, for his supporting performance in \u201cThe Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.\u201dMr. Damon, a four-time Oscar nominee (and a one-time winner, with Ben Affleck, for writing \u201cGood Will Hunting\u201d), was also supposed to direct \u201cManchester by the Sea,\u201d which has backing from Amazon and Roadside Attractions. But he handed that duty over to Kenneth Lonergan, who is widely expected to battle Mr. Chazelle (among others) in the Academy Awards director race. A win would catapult Mr. Lonergan, who also wrote the film\u2019s screenplay, into Hollywood\u2019s major leagues.The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is to unveil its nominations on Jan. 24. The ceremony is scheduled for Feb. 26. If the nominee list includes Ms. Stone and Mr. Gosling \u2014 as the handicappers at Gold Derby, an entertainment honors site, predict \u2014 how will Mr. Teller and Ms. Watson react?It\u2019s hard to know. Both declined to comment. But Ms. Basinger hazarded a guess.\u201cWith two big that-could-have-been-me sobs, I would imagine,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter what kind of face they try to put on afterward, these so-close-yet-so-far-away career moments are very hard to swallow.\u201dThere may be no dishonor that burns quite as hot in Hollywood as having an Oscar-winning (or even -nominated) role slip through your fingers. The instant flow of better scripts, the fame, the fawning \u2014 it all goes to someone else.But again \u2014 kismet. Mr. Travolta as Forrest Gump? It would have been an entirely different movie.Mr. Chazelle, who also directed \u201cWhiplash,\u201d was not just going on instinct when he ultimately sought Ms. Stone, 28, and Mr. Gosling, 36, to play his entertainment industry dreamers in \u201cLa La Land.\u201d They had already exhibited screen chemistry in films like \u201cCrazy, Stupid, Love.\u201dBut he was able to secure the pair only after encountering challenges with Ms. Watson and Mr. Teller.Ms. Watson fell out first, according to three people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations.Tackling \u201cLa La Land\u201d would have made it difficult, if not impossible, for her to take a role she had long coveted: Belle in Disney\u2019s live-action remake of \u201cBeauty and the Beast.\u201d The film, commitments for which would overlap with \u201cLa La Land,\u201d had the extra benefit of filming in Ms. Watson\u2019s home base of London; she could remain close to her boyfriend at the time, a star rugby player for Oxford University.Mr. Chazelle and Ms. Watson parted on good terms. \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d will arrive on March 17. While not conceived as an awards contender, the film is expected to be a box office hit.Lionsgate, which declined to comment, agreed to raise its offer a bit. But then came scheduling difficulties.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Walmart Slowly Makes Strides in E-Commerce", "Date": "2016-12-27", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsWalmart Stores\u2019 tortoise-like digital pace may yet pay off.Walmart\u2019s chief executive, Doug McMillon, has made internet sales a priority after earlier efforts to kick-start growth fell flat. The Jet.com founder Marc Lore \u2014 now Walmart\u2019s head of e-commerce \u2014 had the right ambition. He planned to compete with Amazon on price, but hit a speed bump after Jet was forced to drop its annual membership fee shortly after its start. Still, Mr. Lore\u2019s past success with the sale of the company behind Diapers.com to Amazon shows he knows how to get the online giant\u2019s attention.Jet is already helping bolster sales. Digital revenue jumped 20 percent year-over-year in the three months ended in October, nearly double the 12 percent growth notched in the previous quarter, before Walmart closed the Jet deal.Along with buying Jet, Walmart took a 10 percent stake in China\u2019s JD.com and may be eyeing a similar deal with Flipkart of India. It is targeting a 20 to 30 percent compound annual growth rate in e-commerce over the next three years as it prioritizes online sales over new store openings.Any growth will be from a low base, however. Online revenue represents about 3 percent of some annual $480 billion in top line.There are other points of weakness, too. Amazon is easier to use, with better shipping options and the world\u2019s biggest online inventory. Walmart scores lower on WPP\u2019s BrandZ list of the most valuable global brands, notching at No. 32 versus Amazon\u2019s seventh place. The Alphabet unit Google places first. The survey also showed Walmart lagging Amazon in customer service in important categories like electronics. That\u2019s important: A separate analysis found that the top 30 brands in 2016 outperformed the global MSCI index over the last five years.With Jet\u2019s charismatic founder now sweating such details, Walmart\u2019s attempt to catch up to Amazon should gather pace in 2017.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Founder of Odwalla Tries to Recapture His Mojo", "Date": "2016-12-17", "News": "Supported by\u201cOdwalla took him to the top of the world and then to the bottom,\u201d said Berne Evans, his business partner today. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever gotten over it.\u201dToday it\u2019s possible for a company to develop a drink and cut a deal with an assembly line for hire to produce it, and negotiate another deal for someone to distribute it. Just a decade ago, it required far more capital and, eventually, a sprawling operation.Only a few years after its founding, in 2012, Califia is on track to ring up $100 million in sales and is adding products at a fast clip. The company is considered one of the hottest young brands in the beverage world, leading to whispers about whether one of the big competitors will soon swoop in with a buyout offer that Mr. Steltenpohl and his partners can\u2019t refuse.Not this time, he insists. \u201cI\u2019ve had to sell out once,\u201d Mr. Steltenpohl said. \u201cThat was enough.\u201dThat\u2019s easier to say than to do. A little more than a month ago, Ben Weiss, the founder of the flavored water company Bai, also brushed back talk of a buyout. \u201cIt\u2019s called Bai, not Sell,\u201d he said in an interview at the time.His argument was not unique these days. He had already teamed up to a degree with one competitor. The company\u2019s drinks, which it called \u201cenhanced waters,\u201d got some distribution from Dr Pepper. And Bai was outselling a competitor in retail stores: Over the previous 12 weeks, Bai had outsold Vitaminwater, a Coke brand, for the first time, Mr. Weiss said.It was on track for $300 million in annual sales, outselling Pepsi and Coke on Amazon, internet sales that help many young beverage companies extend their reach to far corners of the country without giant distribution networks.There are more opportunities for young drinks companies than ever, as consumers who have abandoned sugary and diet sodas search for alternatives to plain water. Hint Inc., for instance, is on track to ring up $90 million in sales this year, having leveraged its early distribution in Google\u2019s cafeterias into shelf space at Whole Foods, Target and other stores.Last month, Cason Thorsby, a newly minted entrepreneur in Detroit, began selling in restaurants, bars and groceries there a line of sugar-free, naturally flavored, \u201csuperinfused\u201d sodas branded with his first name. And new juice businesses like OnJuice, Misfit Juicery and Roots Juices, many of which start out selling their products online, come to life every month, or so it seems.Duane Stanford, the editor of Beverage Digest, said a young beverage company today can buy its flavors from a flavor house, branding expertise from a branding expert and manufacturing from a producer on contract.\u201cYou have this situation where these companies can become viable, robust, cash-generating businesses without the help of a big company,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re even getting creative at building independent distribution networks.\u201dOdwalla came together out of a necessity to eat. After graduating from Stanford with a degree in environmental sciences, Mr. Steltenpohl joined with some friends to start a band called the Stance. He also got hooked on the taste of fresh-squeezed orange juice, which his father made for him.\u201cWe were a band of musicians who weren\u2019t really that accomplished \u2014 or popular,\u201d Mr. Steltenpohl said of himself and the band members, who became his partners in Odwalla. \u201cWe were broke and starving, and we figured if we started a juice business, we could live off the juice and maybe make a little extra.\u201dHe read a book, \u201c100 Businesses You Can Start For $100,\u201d and the partners invested in a juicer and started making juice. They didn\u2019t even try to break into groceries and convenience stores, instead stocking refrigerators in video stores and laundromats with Odwalla fresh juice each day. \u201cEveryone who was a musician back then was basically living out of a VW bus,\u201d Mr. Steltenpohl said. \u201cWe quit living in ours and began selling juice out of the back.\u201dFor most of its early years, the Santa Cruz Community Credit Union financed the company. But as consumers cottoned on to its intensely flavored, wacky mixes of unpasteurized juice, it needed something more.A friend introduced Mr. Steltenpohl to Bill Hambrecht, a founder of Hambrecht & Quist, the investment bank that financed some of Silicon Valley\u2019s early start-ups. Hambrecht & Quist became Odwalla\u2019s first institutional investor, and Mr. Hambrecht began serving as a sort of consigliere. \u201cHe helped us understand that anarchy isn\u2019t the best business model,\u201d Mr. Steltenpohl said.In 1993, Hambrecht & Quist helped take Odwalla public, which allowed it to expand nationally and into Canada. By 1996, it had roughly $60 million in sales, a new plant and refrigerated delivery trucks to replace the VW vans.Then the music stopped.\u201cI got a call from the King County department of health,\u201d Mr. Steltenpohl whispered, tearing up at the memory. \u201cFive or six people in Seattle had come down with what looked like E. coli poisoning, and the common element was apple juice, our apple juice.\u201dIn the end, at least 66 people got sick after drinking Odwalla juice, and a child died. The brand\u2019s claims about the healthiness came back to haunt it as reporters dug into its failure to heed warnings about food-safety lapses.Odwalla ended up in the hands of private equity groups, and when it became apparent that the goal was to sell the company to Coca-Cola, Mr. Steltenpohl left.\u201cFor Coke, the thinking was fresh juice is becoming important, we need a fresh juice, Odwalla will fill that need,\u201d he said. \u201cThey never saw the enormous potential of the Odwalla brand and instead saw it as just another product in the juice portfolio.\u201d(Scott Williamson, a spokesman for Coke, said that Odwalla is an important part of what the company calls its \u201cnatural healthy beverages portfolio and that Coke would continue to invest in marketing and new products to grow the brand.\u201d)Mr. Steltenpohl then teamed up with Dee Hock, the founder of Visa, and started a payment system that rewarded loyalty to local businesses.Then he collaborated with an African entrepreneur to develop Adina, a hibiscus tea business now owned by a Mexican beverage company. \u201cIt was a pretty ambitious project to source hibiscus from a women\u2019s co-op in Africa and make it into teas,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a lot of prejudice, and it was difficult to get any margin on the product \u2014 it was so idealistic.\u201dMr. Steltenpohl was charged with building and operating the plant that would squeeze the misfit fruit into juice. But just as construction began on the plant in Bakersfield, Calif., Mr. Evans\u2019s partner in Cuties, the agricultural group now known as the Wonderful Company, backed out. \u201cWithout its clementines to run the plant, we couldn\u2019t run it efficiently,\u201d Mr. Evans said. \u201cIn other words, we overbuilt the plant.\u201dSo Mr. Steltenpohl returned to an idea he had toyed with many years before.Shortly after the E. coli contamination, Odwalla had tried selling a product called Future Shake that was made from almonds, oats and soy. But its texture was too thick, and it never took off.\u201cAt that point, I really wasn\u2019t thinking of returning to the company at all,\u201d he said.But after the surgery, the hospital gave him a protein beverage to aid in his recovery, and the ingredients in it were so bad that he decided he had to make Califia work.The first batch of almond milk rolled off the production line in 2012 and quickly took off.The product had the advantage of its own production facility and what Mr. Steltenpohl had learned about distribution while at Odwalla. It also had the advantage of a far different retail landscape. When the Odwalla crisis hit, Amazon was in its infancy, and Whole Foods, which often serves as a sort of ambassador for new food and beverage brands, had just a handful of stores.Today, Amazon is putting up its own grocery stores, and Whole Foods has nearly 500 stores. At the same time, convenience stores have become much bigger points of distribution for a wide variety of drinks.And consumers are abandoning traditional soft drinks, both sugared and diet, in droves and searching for new flavors delivered in new ways.In the last year, Mr. Steltenpohl has pushed almond milk drinks flavored with things like ginger, mocha and matcha. More recently, Califia is putting the almond milk into cold-brewed and nitrogen-infused coffees, a technique borrowed from the beer business. The nitrogen imparts a sweetness to coffee, helping to reduce the amount of sugar needed. According to data from Euromonitor, bottled coffee is one of the fastest growing beverage categories in America, and Califia\u2019s cold-brewed version outsells the packaged Starbucks version.Mr. Steltenpohl is also trying to avoid past mistakes. The plant is equipped with cutting-edge food-safety monitors that share alerts about problems as they happen with the entire senior management team. Josh Butt, who previously oversaw food safety systems at Danone, the big French dairy company, presides over the plant\u2019s operations.In the year ended Sept. 4, Califia\u2019s sales more than doubled, hitting $85 million, according to data from IRI, which does not include the bottled coffee.In other words, the company is big enough to be attractive to a larger player.\u201cAs for big-brand interest, it would be accurate to say there has already been substantial interest \u2014 but as I\u2019ve said, I really don\u2019t want to go that route of selling while the company is so relatively young,\u201d Mr. Steltenpohl said. \u201cFinding ways to continue to grow the company into a major brand with a high degree of independence is a major lifelong objective.\u201dPrivate equity groups have also come calling. One year ago, the Stripes Group, a Manhattan-based private equity group that has a stake in the food delivery service Blue Apron, among other businesses, put up $50 million for a little less than 20 percent of Califia\u2019s stock, giving the company a value of more than $250 million.Mr. Steltenpohl and his executive team have options giving them the right to as much as a quarter of the company, and Mr. Evans owns the rest \u2014 a majority of the business \u2014 but \u201cit\u2019s really Greg\u2019s company,\u201d he said, adding that he was in no hurry to exit his investment. (Mr. Evans declined to comment on whether he earned money from the Stripes Group transaction.)That said, the tried-and-true endgame of selling out to a big competitor could prove too inviting, particularly in the wake of Danone\u2019s purchase of WhiteWave this year.The advantages that deal brought to WhiteWave have caused some sleepless nights for Mr. Steltenpohl, even though sales of his competitor\u2019s almond milk have been flat. Danone has the wherewithal to pay slotting fees to supermarkets to bump products into prime positions on the refrigerated shelves, regardless of how well they are selling.\u201cThat makes it harder for us younger dogs,\u201d Mr. Steltenpohl said.But he said chains like Target and Kroger are relying more on what he called \u201cfact based\u201d assessment to determine where they put products on their shelves. And he hints that Califia will introduce a \u201ccultured product\u201d some time next year \u2014 read: something probiotic. Which may just give Danone reason to watch its back.Advertisement"}

An inscription on the cross, in German, reads: \u201cJoseph Greiner died here of fever on Jan. 2, 1936, in the service of German research.\u201dWhy is there a Nazi grave in the far reaches of Brazil\u2019s Amazon rain forest?The secret plan, called the Guyana Project, had its origins in an expedition into the Amazon led by Otto Schulz-Kampfhenkel, a Berlin zoologist, documentary filmmaker and member of Hitler\u2019s SS.For 17 months, from 1935 to 1937, Nazi explorers under the guidance of Mr. Schulz-Kampfhenkel hacked through forests around Brazil\u2019s border with French Guiana. They collected animal skulls and indigenous jewelry, and they studied the topography along the Jari River, a 491-mile tributary of the Amazon.Mr. Schulz-Kampfhenkel presented his plan in 1940 to Heinrich Himmler, the chief of the SS and the Gestapo. It envisioned the endeavor as a way to blunt the regional sway of the United States by seizing control of French Guiana and the neighboring Dutch and British colonies (now the independent nations of Suriname and Guyana).Or maybe it had to do with the ill-fated Jari expedition itself.The expedition had a Heinkel He 72 Seekadett seaplane, which was promoted as an example of Nazi industrial innovation. But the aircraft capsized after hitting driftwood a few weeks into the expedition.Throughout their journey, the explorers from a self-described \u201cmaster race\u201d had to rely on indigenous tribes to survive and find their way in the jungle.The Germans were enfeebled by malaria and other illnesses. Mr. Schulz-Kampfhenkel endured severe diphtheria, and an unspecified fever killed Mr. Greiner, the expedition\u2019s foreman. His grave stands to this day as a testament to the star-crossed Nazi foray into the Amazon.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Hunt for Hatchimals, the Elusive Toy of the Holiday Season", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byTwo years ago, the creative and design teams at the toy company Spin Master came up with a big idea they called \u201cHatchimals\u201d\u2014 an interactive, furry creature that hatches out of an egg and grows up before your eyes.Coaxing a creature out of its shell \u201cresonates very well with kids,\u201d said James Martin, senior vice president and head of global business at Spin Master, a Canadian toy company that also sells Etch A Sketch, among many other products. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what\u2019s inside and they get excited about what they may get. There\u2019s this anticipation that builds.\u201dThe company, however, did not bargain on quite this much anticipation. Since their introduction in October, Hatchimals, which have a suggested retail price of $59.99, have become the hot toy of the holiday season that nobody can find. Desperate parents intent on buying a Hatchimal are waiting in long lines at retailers, putting their names on waiting lists, and even buying lottery tickets for the toy. Sellers on Amazon and eBay were asking more than three times the retail price on Friday.Though Spin Master is rushing distribution by airfreighting the remaining Hatchimals from factories in China, the company has not said how many more will be available throughout December, and the shortage is expected to continue. A new batch of Hatchimals will not be available until early in 2017.Spin Master worked to generate buzz for Hatchimals with a secretive launch, and managed to keep all images off the internet until the toy officially \u201chatched\u201d on Oct. 7, which it called \u201cGlobal Hatchimals Day.\u201d Company executives also planned for what they thought would be the right amount of product supply to meet the holiday demand. The company declined to release sales figures.\u201cBy all analyses, we thought we had enough,\u201d Mr. Martin said. \u201cWe had no idea that it would be this big. It\u2019s been exciting but it\u2019s also been daunting as we try to catch up and fill that demand.\u201dThe toy is finding an audience in both boys and girls ranging in age from 3 to 12 years old \u2014 which is a larger demographic than the company expected.\u201cNobody knows why these things happen. They\u2019re an act of God,\u201d said Richard Gottlieb, chief executive of Global Toy Experts and publisher of Global Toy News. While the product may be clever, said Mr. Gottlieb, \u201cit\u2019s all about a moment in time, and it\u2019s hard to predict what makes a product connect.\u201dMandy Nigbur, a stockbroker in Riverton, Utah, knew it wasn\u2019t going to be easy to find a Hatchimal when her 7-year-old daughter requested one from Santa. So when Santa Claus made an appearance at her family party over Thanksgiving weekend, he \u201cknew to tell her his elves weren\u2019t making very many and they might be hard to come by,\u201d Ms. Nigbur said. \u201cBut I was on the hunt.\u201dMs. Nigbur and three of her friends took to the internet and found a website that alerts customers to what\u2019s in stock at retailers near them. They learned that their local Target was supposed to get a small shipment of Hatchimals on Friday, so the women arrived at Target at 4:45 a.m. and waited outside in the 20-degree cold. Their efforts paid off. They each purchased a Hatchimal, which Target sold for the suggested retail price \u2013 and quickly sold out of.\u201cI haven\u2019t decided if Mommy gets to be the star or if Santa will be the one who gets to bring it to her,\u201d said Ms. Nigbur, who said she may be more excited about nabbing the product than her daughter will be to receive it.The chase and the rush to find the item is actually part of the appeal when a certain toy \u2014 such as Cabbage Patch Kids and Tickle Me Elmo \u2014 becomes a phenomenon, according to Mr. Gottlieb. \u201cThere is an irrational exuberance on the part of the consumer with these buying frenzies, which leads to a scarcity of product and crazy high prices,\u201d he said.Some parents have given up on finding a Hatchimal before the holidays. \u201cI am not proud to say I entered into a raffle to win a Hatchimal on a Facebook group,\u201d said Lindsey Hunter Lopez of Los Angeles, whose 3-year-old daughter asked for the toy. \u201cIt was a $10 buy-in for a spot, with 16 spots,\u201d she said. Ms. Lopez did not win the raffle, and said that she would not be hunting for the toy any further.Spin Master hopes to keep the excitement going well past the holidays, and promises that 2017 will bring new species of Hatchimals with more features. \u201cWe\u2019re telling consumers to just be patient,\u201d said Mr. Martin. \u201cThe magic is just as magical in January as it is in December. The experience is just as exciting then. In fact, it may be even a little more because you\u2019ll be getting the first batch of 2017.\u201dBut will kids still want Hatchimals next year, or will they have moved on?\u201cIt\u2019s a hit-driven industry and this is an expensive item, which really tend to sell only at holiday time,\u201d said Gerrick Johnson, an equity research analyst at BMO Capital Markets in New York. \u201cThat\u2019s why the company is willing to airfreight, which is expensive, in order to capture those spending dollars now; rarely do you have an item like this that works two seasons in a row.\u201dSarah Gough, who lives near Guatemala City, is still halfheartedly searching for a Hatchimal for her 10-year-old daughter, but is not expecting to find one soon. \u201cI looked at our major retailer twice and they don\u2019t have it yet,\u201d Ms. Gough said. She plans to ask her parents to look for the toy in the United States. \u201cBut they aren\u2019t really into standing in any lines to pick up toys,\u201d she said.To those parents who are not able to buy the toy in time, Dr. Deborah Gilboa, a family physician in Pittsburgh and a parenting and youth development expert, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a great lesson in delayed gratification.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cubans in Louisville, Ky., Quietly Mark Castro\u2019s Death", "Date": "2016-12-03", "News": "Supported byLOUISVILLE, Ky. \u2014 Yahima Leblanc N\u00fa\u00f1ez and her husband, Pavel Reyes, were Cuban government workers when, in 2009, they plotted an escape. Five years later, after an arduous trek across Central America, including 15 days in a Mexican jail, they arrived here with two backpacks of clothes and a single tidbit of information \u2014 \u201cKentucky Fried Chicken\u201d \u2014 about the state they now call home.\u201cI haven\u2019t even thought about that,\u201d Mr. Reyes said. \u201cI just deleted that from my mind.\u201dThey worry about repercussions and whether they will be granted visas to go back. Some whisper that Ra\u00fal Castro, Fidel\u2019s brother, has spies here in Louisville.\u201cEven when we are here, we are still afraid. The government is very strong, even a thousand miles away,\u201d said Mr. Fuentes, who spent Friday delivering the latest edition of his magazine, which carried the news of Castro\u2019s death.\u201cI no like to talk about Fidel,\u201d said Yolan Gonzalez, 41, one of those Mr. Fuentes visited. Mr. Gonzalez eked out a living selling peanuts on the black market in Cuba before arriving in Louisville in 2009. After delivering newspapers for three years, he now runs a thriving Cuban grocery. Too busy working to perfect his English, he turned to his wife, who was working the cash register, searching for words to explain their feelings about their new life here.\u201cC\u00f3mo es?\u201d he asked, before taking a long pause. \u201cTranquilo,\u201d he finally said. Peaceful.There are now roughly 10,600 Cubans in the greater Louisville metropolitan area. Since 2009, local officials say, their numbers have nearly doubled. Today, foreign-born Cubans account for 19 percent of the Louisville region\u2019s Hispanic population, a greater share than any metropolitan region outside Florida.\u201cWe know that our native-born population is not going to sustain the city\u2019s growth,\u201d said Mr. Warren, who predicted that Cubans would soon surpass Mexicans as Louisville\u2019s largest group of Hispanic immigrants. He called the influx of refugees a \u201cwin-win.\u201dOn Wednesday, a dozen Cubans flew in from Miami, sent by Church World Service, an agency that works with local groups to resettle refugees around the country.They included doctors, engineers and the wife and 2-year-old son of Miguel Guerrero, 28, a doctor who arrived here seven months ago. He now works packing boxes in customer returns for Amazon. He showed up at the airport with a dozen red roses and a spray of balloons to celebrate reuniting with his family.Apart from the death of Castro, these are uneasy times for new Cuban immigrants. President Obama\u2019s move to thaw relations between Washington and Havana could mean the end of the federal program that helped resettle them in the United States. And with President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant comments, some worry that funding for the refugee program will be cut off.\u201cIt\u2019s terrible,\u201d said Dr. Guerrero, who came to the United States via Colombia and knows many other medical professionals waiting there. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way to flee, for us, from that dictatorship.\u201dLouisville has no Cuban association, as some cities with larger Cuban populations do. The closest thing the community has to connective tissue is El Kentubano, the publication run by Mr. Fuentes, who also works full time as an air-quality engineer for the state. He publishes the magazine out of his basement home office in Frankfort, the capital.But Cubans are leaving their imprint on Louisville\u2019s food, culture and art. At Havana Rumba, a Cuban restaurant, Joel Toste, an owner, dismissed talk of Castro with a wave of his hand. \u201cThat\u2019s political,\u201d he said.Instead, Mr. Toste pulled out his iPhone and proudly showed photographs of paintings he intended to display at the Jewish Community Center. He was 24 years old and studying to be an artist in Havana in 1998 when he won an immigration lottery to come to the United States. Mr. Toste had no relatives in Miami; the refugee agency was promoting Louisville. He agreed to come.\u201cI just wanted to get to a quiet place somehow,\u201d he said. What did he know about the city? \u201cNada \u2014 the only thing I knew is baseball bats,\u201d he said, referring to the famed Louisville Slugger bat factory. \u201cCuba is big for baseball.\u201dThat yearning for a \u201cquiet place\u201d was one reason many Cubans said they found happiness here. If they had the means, some said they might prefer Florida. But here, they can build comfortable lives, learn English in a city where Spanish is rarely spoken, and put some distance between themselves and their difficult memories.\u201cMiami,\u201d said Maria Antonia Garcia Lozano, 59, a former physical education teacher who arrived last month, \u201cis Cuba with food and money.\u201dMrs. Leblanc N\u00fa\u00f1ez and Mr. Reyes are among those trying to let the past be the past. Both worked for Cuba\u2019s Ministry of Culture; she was a German translator, and he ran the state copyright agency.They decided to leave, both said, because they saw little future for themselves in a country where $8 a month was a common wage and educated professionals lived with their parents. So they secretly planned for Mr. Reyes to defect while on a government trip to Germany by flying to Ecuador, which accepted Cubans without a passport.It proved a terrifying move. When Mr. Reyes did not return, government officials sent Mrs. Leblanc N\u00fa\u00f1ez home from work and searched through her emails, hoping to find evidence that would implicate her in his escape.\u201cPeople are making jokes and parties in Miami, but for me, it\u2019s just another chapter,\u201d she said. \u201cHim passing away is not going to change all the mess that he has done. I just want to leave all that behind.\u201dFollow Sheryl Gay Stolberg on Twitter: @SherylNYTAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ryan Holiday Sells Stoicism as a Life Hack, Without Apology", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byIn an underground gymnasium in New York City in October, the author Ryan Holiday spoke to nearly 350 people about the transformative power of pessimism and self-doubt.During his talk, Mr. Holiday was self-deprecating \u2014 \u201cI will start with the question many of you are probably asking, which is, \u2018Who the hell is this guy?\u2019\u201d \u2014 and casually profane, drawing a few titters from the crowd when he urged them to question their sense of self-importance. \u201cYou might think that you\u2019re hot,\u201d he said, adding a noun that is better left unprinted. \u201cThe reality, and the Stoics say it over and over, is that\u2019s not the case.\u201dWhen an audience member asked Mr. Holiday if Stoicism \u201cis becoming too trendy,\u201d he answered by defending his part in popularizing it as a self-help strategy.\u201cWe\u2019ve only captured a very small fraction of the potential market,\u201d he said, sounding more entrepreneurial than philosophic. \u201cStoicism is a philosophy designed for the masses, and if it has to be simplified a bit to reach the masses, so be it.\u201dNow, he is harnessing his considerable marketing prowess to sell Stoicism. He is like a snake-oil salesman who swears he has abandoned snake oil, but not the highly effective sales tactics.\u201cIf you\u2019re shameless enough, you can sell anything,\u201d he said of his marketing abilities.But Mr. Holiday maintains that his being a good salesman doesn\u2019t clash with his identity as a Stoic.A California native, he lives on a 40-acre ranch with his wife and newborn son in Bastrop County, Tex. Their modest two-story house has a walk-in gun closet, where Mr. Holiday stows a .22 hunting rifle, a 12-gauge shotgun, and a bow and arrow. He keeps a .243 next to the bed, to chase off coyotes and foxes. He shot a jack rabbit from his front porch, and skinned and ate it, and has taken up hog hunting. They have a small herd of 10 cattle, three goats, two donkeys, and chickens, ducks, geese and a guinea hen. \u201cWe don\u2019t know that much about raising cows,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re learning.\u201dMr. Holiday discovered Stoicism by reading Marcus Aurelius\u2019s \u201cMeditations\u201d when he was a 19-year-old sophomore at the University of California, Riverside. He read it four times in a row and taped passages to his dorm room wall, over his bed. \u201cThe essential idea of Stoicism in my interpretation is, you don\u2019t control the world around you, you control how you respond,\u201d he said. \u201cAt 19, that\u2019s very empowering.\u201dThat summer, Mr. Holiday got an internship at a Hollywood talent agency, the Collective. They offered him a job, with a starting salary of $30,000, and he dropped out of college and moved to Los Angeles. \u201cI was the kid who was going places,\u201d he said.A year later, he went to work for American Apparel, where he handled public relations as the company faced sexual harassment allegations against Mr. Charney. He grew disillusioned with his work as a hype man and decided to write a self-indicting expos\u00e9.\u201cI was disgusted with how it all worked,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea of the book was, I\u2019m going to put all these things in a giant pile and light them on fire.\u201dSome of Mr. Holiday\u2019s controversial clients heaped praise on the book. (\u201cBehind my reputation as marketing genius there is Ryan Holiday,\u201d Mr. Charney gushed in a blurb.) Mr. Holiday seemed to revel in his role as the villain. On the cover, a comic-book-style rendering of Mr. Holiday glares down condescendingly, a lit cigarette dangling from his mouth.Two years later, he published \u201cThe Obstacle Is the Way,\u201d and was embraced as a cleareyed sage offering ancient solutions for first-world problems like status anxiety and work addiction. Mr. Holiday, a professed media con man, started selling a repackaged 2,300-year-old philosophy.After \u201cObstacle\u201d became an unexpected hit, Mr. Holiday delivered more books, including \u201cEgo Is the Enemy,\u201d about the treacherous nature of ego, and \u201cThe Daily Stoic: 366 Meditations on Wisdom, Perseverance and the Art of Living,\u201d a compilation of inspirational quotations from famous Stoics.It\u2019s hard to fathom that the same person who wrote \u201cTrust Me, I\u2019m Lying,\u201d a bombastic treatise on the art of self-promotion through media manipulation, went on to write a meditation on the perils of self-absorption and pride. But Mr. Holiday doesn\u2019t have any trouble reconciling the Jekyll and Hyde-like phases of his career. Marketing is what he does, he said; Stoicism is who he is.In the past few months, he has given talks to the Texas Rangers baseball team, a Seattle accounting firm, a telecommunications company in Austin and at HSBC Bank in London and Google\u2019s offices in London, New York and Mountain View, Calif. The military has invited him to speak to elite fighters with the United States Special Operations Command.Mr. Holiday\u2019s message about the need for resilience and humility has caught on with N.F.L. players and coaches, including those of the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks, which both invited Mr. Holiday to visit their teams\u2019 headquarters.Mr. Holiday\u2019s efforts to rebrand Stoicism as a self-help system for overachievers doesn\u2019t sit well with some philosophers and academics. At Stoicon, a few attendees were irked by Mr. Holiday\u2019s prominent role at the convention (Stoics are philosophically opposed to complaining, so their objections were mild).During a question-and-answer session, one audience member faulted Mr. Holiday for holding up flawed historical figures like John D. Rockefeller, a rapacious capitalist, as a model of Stoicism. Another questioned whether Mr. Holiday\u2019s pursuit of success as a marketer and author was consistent with the Stoic emphasis on detachment from material gain.Mr. Holiday admits that it can be hard at times to reconcile his stature with Stoic principles, particularly now that he\u2019s a sought-after motivational speaker with a growing following among sports stars and celebrities.\u201cIt has the effect of making you think you\u2019re more important than you are,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good recipe for being full of it.\u201dLiving in rural Texas, with his cows, goats and donkeys, helps keep his ego in check, he said. \u201cMy neighbors don\u2019t care that I\u2019m an author,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s inherently ego-inhibiting.\u201dRanch life is a pretty good training ground for a Stoic, it turns out. Nature is unpredictable. His donkey Buddy was attacked by a mountain lion, and his chickens have been disappearing at night. He suspected coyotes at first, but a more likely culprit emerged as Mr. Holiday gave a walking tour of his ranch one swampy afternoon. A neighbor\u2019s dog followed him home from the cow pasture and snapped up one of his chickens, running in ecstatic circles and shaking the bird.Mr. Holiday yelled and lunged at the dog, which dropped the chicken and ran off. The chicken puffed up her feathers and strutted away. Both the chicken and Mr. Holiday seemed unruffled.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Major Step for Drone Delivery, Amazon Flies Package to Customer in England", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "Supported byThree years later, his claims no longer look so outlandish.The flight \u2014 to deliver an Amazon Fire streaming device and popcorn to a customer identified only as Richard B. \u2014 took off from a nearby Amazon warehouse and lasted 13 minutes, covering about two miles.Amazon said it would now test drone deliveries with two more customers near Cambridge, an English city where the company has a large drone-testing plant. If the tests are successful, the company says it wants to expand the number of consumers who could participate in the trial to dozens in the coming months, eventually allowing hundreds to use the drone service.The start of customer trials for the drone delivery service, which Amazon calls Prime Air, is a milestone for a technology that could eventually automate an important part of Amazon\u2019s business as the company looks to cement its position as the world\u2019s dominant online retailer.There are reasons to be skeptical about how broadly drones can be used, however, because of aviation rules, weather restrictions and weight limitations on cargo.Experts say that the advent of widespread drone deliveries, even if technically possible, would take years, and regulators from the United States and elsewhere could block the plans.Even if drones end up handling only a small portion of Amazon\u2019s overall deliveries, the implications could be far-reaching.The company, for instance, might not need as many truck drivers or other costly logistical operations. Drones could also have environmental benefits, by reducing reliance on pollution-belching vehicles. The biggest boon may be to customers, who could be able to receive their orders more quickly, depending where they live.The fact that Amazon\u2019s latest drone tests were in Britain is no coincidence.Not all of the residents in the area have been fans, however.Julia Napier, who helped found a Cambridgeshire association that maintains public footpaths around one of Amazon\u2019s test sites, said the company\u2019s drones threatened wildlife and the wider countryside, something that the company has denied.\u201cThey are testing those drones here because they can\u2019t do it in America,\u201d she said. \u201cWhatever the Americans don\u2019t want, I don\u2019t want it, either.\u201dSo far, the devices are limited to carrying cargo weighing less than five pounds. They use cameras to identify landing marker pads that customers place in their backyards or in other unobstructed locations.Amazon is not the first company to test drone delivery.Amazon, however, with its deep pockets, logistical expertise and technological prowess, still seems the most likely to push widespread drone delivery into the mainstream, at least in the Western world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "2016 Was a Year for Undoing Major Deals", "Date": "2016-12-26", "News": "Supported byIt may not have been a banner year for striking deals, but 2016 was a healthy time for breaking them.This year was the biggest in terms of volume for busted transactions \u2014 those withdrawn after being announced \u2014 since the depths of the financial crisis eight years ago, as big takeovers by the likes of the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, the Oreos maker Mondelez and the office supply retailer Staples were consigned to the scrap heap.The broken deals represent almost a quarter of the $3.55 trillion in transactions announced over the past 12 months.Many of the deals that perished were born of the heady ambitions that filled corporate chieftains\u2019 heads during the past two years. C.E.O.s and their bankers and lawyers pursued big, risky transactions to achieve the kind of growth that they were largely unable to achieve on their own.Still, as the year winds down, it\u2019s worth taking a moment to remember some of the most notable deals that didn\u2019t come to pass, depriving bankers, lawyers and other advisers of millions of dollars in fees.A union of the two pharmaceutical companies, first announced a year ago, would have been the biggest takeover in 15 years. It would have yielded Pfizer the huge takeover that it had long coveted \u2014 and, perhaps more important, given it the chance to finally relocate its corporate home abroad to lower its tax bill. Unusually, the purchase of the Botox maker Allergan would also have paved the way for Pfizer to eventually break itself in two.When the two industrial conglomerates began speaking about a potential merger in the spring of 2015, it looked like a new titan, whose products would have run from thermostats to jet engines, was in the offing. But United Technologies\u2019 desire to strike a deal fell as its stock price declined, while its executives disagreed with their Honeywell counterparts over who would control the combined company.What was meant to be the creation of an energy giant quickly collapsed into recriminations and a bitter fight fueled by buyer\u2019s remorse. Energy Transfer, an operator of oil and gas pipelines, initially sought to buy its smaller rival after failing once before.But the slump in oil prices made the deal suddenly seem too expensive, leaving Energy Transfer to fight in the courts for a way to terminate the deal. Months of legal wrangling ensued, and in June a Delaware judge ruled that Energy Transfer had the right to walk away.The bidding war for Starwood proved fierce, as Marriott International battled with a group led by the Chinese insurer Anbang for control of the Westin and Sheraton hotel chains. By March, Anbang and its partners apparently had prevailed, as Marriott declined to raise its bid in the hopes that it would catch a last-minute break.Advertisement"}

Pat McCrory said Monday that the governor would call a special session on Wednesday. But in a sign of the continuing acrimony between Democrats and Republicans, State Representative Tim Moore, the House speaker, and State Senator Phil Berger, the Senate president, said the governor-elect was \u201cnot telling the truth about the legislature committing itself into session. We\u2019ve always said that was Governor McCrory\u2019s decision, and if he calls us back, we will be prepared to act.\u201dMr. Cooper\u2019s announcement came after the Charlotte City Council, by a vote of 10 to 0, rescinded the anti-discrimination ordinance it had passed on Feb. 22. At the time, Mr. McCrory, a Republican, had warned the City Council that if it passed the measure, which allowed transgender people to use the restroom that best corresponds to their gender identity, North Carolina\u2019s lawmakers would respond with \u201cimmediate state legislative intervention.\u201dThe measure was hastily signed by Mr. McCrory in March after it was introduced by Republicans in a special session of the General Assembly. That incited a backlash, with companies announcing they would not bring new jobs to North Carolina and performers like Bruce Springsteen canceling concerts. The N.B.A. moved its 2017 All-Star Game to New Orleans and the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the Atlantic Coast Conference announced that they would move championship sporting events out of the state. The Justice Department sued the state over the law, as did a number of North Carolina residents represented by lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union and the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, a gay-rights group.The state law requires people in publicly owned buildings to use restrooms that correspond with the gender listed on their birth certificates. It also nullifies local ordinances like the one passed in Charlotte that established anti-discrimination protections for L.G.B.T. people.The law came on the heels of a number of high-profile cultural milestones, including the 2014 debut of the Amazon television show \u201cTransparent,\u201d about a transgender woman, and the 2015 public coming out of the Olympic gold medalist Caitlyn Jenner (formerly Bruce Jenner).In North Carolina, anger over the law and the backlash it engendered is widely believed to have been the most important factor in propelling Mr. Cooper to victory when other Democrats, including the presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and a candidate for United States Senate, Deborah Ross, were defeated in the state.A repeal of House Bill 2, however, could help both legislative and executive branches. Republicans in the General Assembly would not have to worry about Mr. Cooper using the controversial law to raise money and bludgeon them rhetorically.And Mr. Cooper could claim an early victory, after apparently helping to broker a deal between Republican leaders and the City of Charlotte.\u201cDespite the efforts of Republicans to diminish what he can do, it shows he remains relevant,\u201d said Ferrel Guillory, the director of the Program on Public Life at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He added, \u201cThe governor retains informal powers: the power of persuasion, to use the bully pulpit, to put a coalition together.\u201dMr. McCrory leaves office on Jan. 1. On Monday, a spokesman, Graham Wilson, said in a statement that the governor had \u201calways advocated a repeal of the overreaching Charlotte ordinance.\u201d Mr. Wilson said that Democrats, including Mr. Cooper and Mayor Jennifer Roberts of Charlotte, had blocked those efforts for political gain.Mr. Berger and Mr. Moore said Mr. Cooper and Ms. Roberts had engaged in a \u201cpolitical stunt to drive out-of-state money into the governor\u2019s race.\u201d They said it was \u201cdisingenuous and dishonest\u201d of Mr. Cooper to take credit for brokering a solution. \u201cFor months,\u201d they said, \u201cwe\u2019ve said if Charlotte would repeal its bathroom ordinance that created the problem, we would take up the repeal of H.B. 2.\u201dMr. Griffin said that if the legislature carried out a full repeal, it would signify the end of \u201cthe most vile and hateful and discriminatory anti-L.G.B.T. bill in the history of the country today,\u201d and that he hoped the repeal of the law would open the door for \u201cfully inclusive\u201d local and statewide anti-discrimination measures.The Charlotte City Council, in a resolution on Monday, reaffirmed its opposition to discrimination based on, among other things, \u201csexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression.\u201d Elsewhere, it stated that if H.B. 2 were repealed, the City Council could \u201cenact new ordinances.\u201dIt also said that the repeal of its own ordinance would not be valid if the General Assembly refused to repeal the statewide law in its entirety by Dec. 31.Also Monday evening, Mr. McCrory said he had signed a remaining portion of the package of legislation, approved by the General Assembly on Friday, that strips many powers from Mr. Cooper. The bill would, among other things, reduce the number of state employees who serve at the governor\u2019s pleasure from 1,500 to 425, take away Mr. Cooper\u2019s ability to fill seats on the boards of state universities and require that members of his cabinet be approved by the State Senate.Advertisement"}

The lyrical \u201cMoonlight,\u201d about a young black man growing up in a poor Miami neighborhood, drew six nominations, including best drama, director and screenplay. \u201cManchester by the Sea,\u201d focused on a New England plumber coping with horrific loss, was also nominated for best drama, receiving five nods total.Joining those two films in the best drama category were \u201cLion,\u201d an adoption tear-jerker set in India and the Weinstein Company\u2019s lead Oscar hope; Mel Gibson\u2019s \u201cHacksaw Ridge,\u201d based on the true story of the World War II hero Desmond T. Doss; and the CBS Films neo-western \u201cHell or High Water.\u201dNominated alongside the Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone-led \u201cLa La Land\u201d for best comedy or musical: the raunchy superhero blockbuster \u201cDeadpool\u201d; the Ireland-set musical \u201cSing Street\u201d; the Meryl Streep vehicle \u201cFlorence Foster Jenkins\u201d; and \u201c20th Century Women,\u201d a comedic period drama starring Annette Bening and set for release on Christmas Day.\u201cAs we speak, the entire \u2018Deadpool\u2019 team is engaged in a grotesque, early morning tickle-fight,\u201d Ryan Reynolds, the star of that film, wrote on Twitter.The Globes are bestowed by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, a group of mostly freelance journalists, only 85 of whom are active members. Long competitive with the more highbrow Oscars, the Globes often strive to make agenda-setting choices.\u201cI\u2019m very appreciative,\u201d Mr. Gibson said in a statement. \u201cThis film was a labor of love for everyone involved and is also about a man who truly exemplified love and goodness.\u201dThe press association filled out the directing category with Damien Chazelle (\u201cLa La Land\u201d), Barry Jenkins (\u201cMoonlight\u201d), Kenneth Lonergan (\u201cManchester by the Sea\u201d) and Tom Ford (\u201cNocturnal Animals\u201d).Mr. Scorsese may have diminished his prospects by delivering the film late. \u201cSilence,\u201d an epic drama about two priests who face violence in 17th-century Japan, was shut out on Monday. It was a bad morning for other Hollywood elder statesmen, with Clint Eastwood\u2019s \u201cSully\u201d uninvited to the banquet and Warren Beatty\u2019s \u201cRules Don\u2019t Apply\u201d barely alive, receiving a lone nod for Lily Collins\u2019s performance.Also ignored was Nate Parker\u2019s \u201cThe Birth of a Nation,\u201d a slave rebellion film once seen as a leading awards contender that collapsed at the box office after scrutiny of Mr. Parker\u2019s past; he was accused of rape in 1999 and later acquitted.The diversity on display during Hollywood\u2019s self-congratulatory season \u2014 or the lack thereof \u2014 has been an incendiary topic in recent years. When Oscar voters put forward an all-white group of acting nominees at the most recent Academy Awards, there was a global outcry. The Globes are not necessarily predictive of the Oscars, but Monday\u2019s nominations give reason to believe that a wide variety of faces will be honored.In the acting categories, Globe voters noted performers like Viola Davis and Denzel Washington, both nominated for \u201cFences,\u201d an adaptation of August Wilson\u2019s play about race and family relations. Naomie Harris and Mahershala Ali received attention for their roles in \u201cMoonlight\u201d; Dev Patel was nominated for \u201cLion\u201d; and Ruth Negga made the best actress cut for \u201cLoving,\u201d a gentle portrait of a real-life couple whose marriage ended anti-miscegenation laws.\u201cHidden Figures,\u201d about unsung black heroines in the space race of the 1960s, received attention for Octavia Spencer\u2019s acting and a score by Pharrell Williams, Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch.But the Globes are not especially prognostic of what will happen on Oscar night. Last year, \u201cThe Revenant\u201d and \u201cThe Martian\u201d were the Globes\u2019 best picture winners; both lost to \u201cSpotlight\u201d at the Oscars.The Globes ceremony has been increasingly important on the television front, largely for its acknowledgment of fledgling series like \u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine.\u201d This time around, \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d a new NBC drama, may have filled that quota. \u201cThis Is Us\u201d received nominations for best drama and for two actresses (Chrissy Metz and Mandy Moore).In the best drama category, rookie shows made a near-sweep of the nominations, with \u201cThe Crown,\u201d \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cWestworld\u201d filling out the category, along with the HBO stalwart \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201dSeveral returning shows were snubbed. \u201cMr. Robot,\u201d last year\u2019s drama winner, received only acting nominations; Fox\u2019s \u201cEmpire\u201d got nothing. Showtime, which has had three wins in the best drama category in the past five years, fell to just one nomination: Liev Schreiber for best actor in a drama in \u201cRay Donovan.\u201dStreaming services have made inroads at the Globes, but on Monday the traditional players were back on top. HBO led the pack with 14 nominations (up from seven last year), and FX was in second place with nine. FX was propelled by \u201cThe People vs. O. J. Simpson,\u201d which led all shows with five nominations, including best limited series.In the best comedy category, the returning winner, Amazon\u2019s \u201cMozart in the Jungle,\u201d is up against Amazon\u2019s \u201cTransparent,\u201d HBO\u2019s \u201cVeep\u201d and two shows that feature primarily black casts: ABC\u2019s \u201cblack-ish\u201d and FX\u2019s rookie hit \u201cAtlanta.\u201dThe press association has labored in recent years to shed its reputation for bizarre nominations that were interpreted more as efforts to populate the banquet with stars than honor the year\u2019s best in film and television. Monday\u2019s list contained no outright embarrassments, but there were still some head-scratchers, including a nod for Jonah Hill as best comedic actor in the critical dud \u201cWar Dogs.\u201dAs previously announced, Ms. Streep, a 30-time Globes nominee and eight-time winner, will receive the Cecil B. DeMille lifetime achievement award.Foreign film nominees were \u201cDivines\u201d (France), \u201cElle\u201d (France), \u201cNeruda\u201d (Chile), \u201cThe Salesman\u201d (Iran and France) and \u201cToni Erdmann\u201d (Germany).Among film companies, Lionsgate was the runaway winner, with its various labels and partnerships resulting in 17 nominations. A24 was second, with nine, while Paramount and Universal each had eight.Jimmy Fallon is to host the 74th Golden Globes in all of his goofy glory, taking the reins from the acerbic British comedian Ricky Gervais.

But to bring it off the show took it very seriously, persuading the composer Nico Muhly to take a break from working on his second opera for the Metropolitan Opera to write the music and engaging the soprano Ana Mar\u00eda Mart\u00ednez to record it during her recent run at the San Francisco Opera. In its offbeat way, the show revived the long-dormant practice of commissioning new opera for TV.The aria will be a fleeting \u2014 but important \u2014 moment in the new season of \u201cMozart in the Jungle,\u201d which combines screwball comedy and magical realism to tell the story of a fictional New York orchestra. With the musicians locked out in a labor dispute, the season begins with their music director, played by Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal, in Venice working on the comeback concert of a Maria Callas-like diva portrayed by Monica Bellucci.Amy Fisher\u2019s aria follows a tradition of true-crime opera: Leoncavallo said his blood-soaked verismo masterpiece \u201cPagliacci\u201d was inspired by a real incident, and Mr. Muhly\u2019s recent opera \u201cTwo Boys\u201d was based on a murder in England. But \u201cMozart\u201d did not set out to use the story of Amy Fisher, who was a Long Island high school student when she had an affair with an auto body repairman, Joey Buttafuoco, and shot and wounded his wife, Mary Jo.They got to work, debating in texts and emails whether a part of Mr. Morris\u2019s libretto should rhyme. (They agreed it should, inspired by the words leading up to \u201cDido\u2019s Lament\u201d in Purcell\u2019s \u201cDido and Aeneas.\u201d) Then Mr. Muhly set it to music, conjuring a sound world of looped voices, electronic instruments and repetitive counting to try to imagine Ms. Fisher just before the shooting.\u201cIt feels like something that\u2019s specifically operatic \u2014 that you can access that combination of emotion, motivation, motility, all those things at once, in a way that only opera can,\u201d Mr. Muhly said. \u201cThe thing I tried very hard to do was not turn it into a kind of funny, ha-ha, let\u2019s-laugh-at-her thing.\u201dSitting beside the Grand Canal during a break in the shooting last summer in Venice, Ms. Bellucci said she had worked with an opera coach and studied videos of Maria Callas, Anna Netrebko and Beverly Sills to prepare for her lip-syncing scenes. \u201cIt was so interesting to see how they move onstage, and also how everything is so fragile \u2014 because they have an instrument inside themselves.\u201dSo will the rest of the Long Island Lolita opera ever be written?

The question dogged a United Nations campaign that featured the superhero as a symbol of self-empowerment for girls and women.Q. There seems to be some disagreement about what a feminist icon should look like.What about those skimpy outfits?Yeah, so? Superman had a skintight outfit that showed every little ripple, didn\u2019t he? Doesn\u2019t he have a great big bulge in his crotch? Hello! So why don\u2019t they complain about that? And who says Wonder Woman is \u201cwhite\u201d? I\u2019m half-Mexican. Gal Gadot is Israeli. The character is an Amazonian princess, not \u201cAmerican.\u201d They\u2019re trying to put her in a box, and she\u2019s not in a box.Did you ever think of your character as sexy?If you think of the \u201970s, that was miniskirts and bikinis. I never really thought of Wonder Woman as a super-racy character. She wasn\u2019t out there being predatory. She was saying: \u201cYou have a problem with a strong woman? I am who I am, get over it.\u201d I never played her as mousy. I played her being for women, not against men. For fair play and fair pay. Some critics called Wonder Woman a \u201cmale fantasy.\u201d But wasn\u2019t the show more aimed at girls than boys?I still have women at airports coming up to me saying: \u201cOh, you don\u2019t know what it meant to me. That show got me through this difficult time, that difficult time.\u201d That\u2019s really where the fantasy became a reality, where Wonder Woman became something much more than a TV show or a comic book. And I\u2019ll tell you this, when women recognize me in airports, I hold them in my arms and they cry. If a guy comes up and says, \u201cOh my God, I had such a crush on you when I was a teenager,\u201d I say: \u201cTalk to the hand. I don\u2019t want to know.\u201dWonder Woman, of course, was not your first experience being celebrated for your beauty. How did it feel to get your first burst of fame by winning the 1972 Miss World USA pageant?That\u2019s so funny. I did one beauty pageant \u2014 one! I had been on the road as a singer, I came home, and I entered one beauty pageant. I didn\u2019t like it very much, because there was no talent in it. I just thought it was stupid. I still do.You always said that music was your first love. When you were a teenager playing in a band with Gary Burghoff [who later played Radar on \u201cM*A*S*H\u201d], did you guys ever think you two would end up making it big in Hollywood?No, I was 16. We were just a local band, and then I went with another band, and another band, and finally started doing some recording, mostly jingles and some session work. I was doing some writing and plugging along, as every other girl who goes to L.A. does, and then I finally got \u201cWonder Woman.\u201dI guess \u201cThe Flying Nun\u201d and \u201cBewitched\u201d were about female characters with superhuman powers, but \u201cWonder Woman\u201d was really a breakthrough in terms of television superheroines. Why did the show strike such a chord with girls watching at home?There was this idea that inside every woman is a secret self. It\u2019s much less about the color of your skin, much less about your height or weight or beauty, but it\u2019s the attitude, the strength of character, the fight for rights: the beauty within, the wisdom within.At the height of your fame in the 1970s, you were voted the most beautiful woman in the world in one poll. Does that sort of thing change the way you see yourself in the mirror?I\u2019m sure I went and looked. And I\u2019m sure I had no makeup on and I\u2019m sure I went, \u201cHuh, really?\u201dYou have been open about your struggles with alcohol and finding sobriety. Was that all about the post-\u201cWonder Woman\u201d blues?Yes and no. I think that that was more about my bad marriage. I went through some tough times, and it brought solace at the time. But of course, that just rears its ugly head and bites you. But now it\u2019s coming up on 20 years since I\u2019ve been sober.Along with your second husband, you were big figures on the D.C. social circuit. Do you still get out there the way you did?We\u2019re still pretty active politically. Less so now than we used to be. But no. The era of Beltway parties that include both sides of the aisle, it just doesn\u2019t happen anymore. People used to talk to each other, they worked things out, they tried to get things done. They stopped talking to one another. It\u2019s just gotten so ugly.It was Hillary. I\u2019ve known Hillary Clinton for 35 years. She is the kindest, most wonderful human being.

{"Headline": "The Whatchamacallit Economy", "Date": "2016-12-16", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorIt\u2019s a hip, fast-growing sector of the economy, filled with headline-grabbing companies: Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, Task Rabbit. But there\u2019s a gnawing problem: People aren\u2019t sure what to call it. Many critics dislike the term most commonly used, the \u201csharing economy,\u201d because there often isn\u2019t much actual sharing going on. Others prefer to call it the on-demand economy, peer-to-peer economy, crowd-based economy, gig economy or collaborative economy.Uber, Lyft and other e-hailing companies love to say they are \u201cride-sharing companies,\u201d signaling that they are collaborative and not crassly capitalistic. These companies maintain that their drivers share their cars with passengers and use apps to share information about where they are. But many academics and workers in this sector assert that the business model seems less like sharing than like traditional corporate profit-making that happens to use an app.Rochelle LaPlante, who works for Mechanical Turk, an internet platform for people to post and find piecework jobs, sees public relations spin behind the term \u201csharing economy.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s an exchange of money,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not really sharing if a person\u2019s paying for it.\u201dHer point: If you\u2019re living in San Francisco and you want to drive to Palo Alto and take a friend with you (perhaps splitting the cost of gas), that\u2019s ride sharing. But if you take an Uber to get to Palo Alto, that seems more like a taxi ride.Arun Sundararajan, author of the new book \u201cThe Sharing Economy: The End of Employment and the Rise of Crowd-Based Capitalism,\u201d said he chose that term for his title because so many people use it. Yet Mr. Sundararajan, a professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, actually prefers \u201ccrowd-based capitalism,\u201d because a crowd of consumers obtains services by connecting, via a platform, with a crowd of suppliers.In the early 2000s, the sharing economy generally referred to people with underused assets \u2014 whether automobiles, homes or vacuum cleaners \u2014 who let others \u201cshare\u201d them, usually for a fee. Such sharing was viewed not as a business but as a way to promote sustainability.\u201cThe \u2018sharing economy\u2019 phrase has stuck,\u201d Professor Sundararajan said, partly because it suggests a personal touch \u2014 say, an Airbnb host putting visitors up in a spare bedroom. \u201cThere\u2019s a connection that people seem to enjoy.\u201d (Even though some say that the Airbnb hosts who own a dozen apartments are not really sharing.)Ms. Botsman added that some companies can legitimately be called sharing companies, like Turo (previously called RelayRides), which enables car owners to rent out their unused cars, and BlaBlaCar, which connects riders with car owners planning to drive from one city to another.With the term \u201csharing economy\u201d under scrutiny, experts are casting about for substitutes. Miriam A. Cherry, a St. Louis University law professor, recommends the \u201con-demand economy,\u201d but critics say that isn\u2019t exact enough, because ordering a pizza by phone can be considered part of an on-demand economy. Others prefer \u201cgig economy,\u201d but some assert that phrase isn\u2019t suitable for 21st-century app-based companies because gig workers \u2014 think jazz musicians \u2014 have been around for decades.Some embrace \u201cplatform economy,\u201d but Geoffrey G. Parker, an engineering professor at Dartmouth and the author of \u201cPlatform Revolution,\u201d says that name is too broad because it includes giants like Google, Facebook and YouTube. Others like the \u201capp-based on-demand economy\u201d (the Abode economy), the \u201cgig on-demand economy\u201d (the GOD economy) or the \u201cplatform on-demand economy\u201d (the POD economy), whose workers could be called pods.Despite the criticism that \u201csharing economy\u201d is inaccurate and sounds like corporate spin, Professor Sundararajan says we might be stuck with that description because corporations and the public so often use it. When Silicon Valley and Madison Avenue latch on to a phrase, it\u2019s not easy to shake it off.Steven Greenhouse, a former labor and workplace reporter for The New York Times, is the author of \u201cThe Big Squeeze: Tough Times for the American Worker.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He notes that there are no less than 1,500 books listed on Amazon with \u201cempathy\u201d in the title or subtitle. In politics, practically no higher value exists than being empathetic: Think of the words \u201cI feel your pain\u201d coming from Bill Clinton through a strategically gnawed lip. Empathy is what is invoked, on both sides, in confrontations between the police and African-Americans. (Imagine how it feels to live in a universe of systematic and serial injustice directed at you; imagine how it feels to work in a profession that continually puts you in harm\u2019s way.)Mr. Bloom, a psychology professor at Yale, is having none of it. Empathy, he argues, is \u201ca poor moral guide\u201d in almost all realms of life, whether it\u2019s public policy, private charity or interpersonal relationships. \u201cEmpathy is biased, pushing us in the direction of parochialism and racism,\u201d he writes. Offended? He\u2019s just warming up. \u201cIt is innumerate,\u201d he continues, \u201cfavoring the one over the many. It can spark violence; our empathy for those close to us is a powerful force for war and atrocity toward others.\u201dIt turns out that Mr. Bloom\u2019s view is far more nuanced than the provocative declaration above. (There are moments when he fireproofs his arguments with so many qualifications that they\u2019re hardly inflammatory by the time he\u2019s done.) And he is by no means making the case for heartlessness. His point, rather, is that empathy is untempered by reason, emanating from the murky bayou of the gut. He prefers a kind of rational compassion \u2014 a mixture of caring and detached cost-benefit analysis. His book is a systematic attempt to show why this is so.To those who say empathy is essential to morality, he\u2019d reply that morality has many sources. \u201cMany wrongs\u201d \u2014 like littering or cheating on your taxes \u2014 \u201chave no distinct victims to empathize with.\u201d Nor does it appear that the most empathetic people behave the most ethically. \u201cThere have been hundreds of studies, with children and adults,\u201d he writes, \u201cand overall the results are: meh.\u201dTo those who say empathy motivates philanthropy, Mr. Bloom wouldn\u2019t dispute it. He personally is not immune, having given money for years to a child \u2014 and then the child\u2019s family \u2014 in Indonesia. But he\u2019d say that empathy is generally a bad tool to use for allocating resources. We have a limited capacity for feeling the pain of others, and we tend to identify with those who remind us of ourselves. \u201cThis perverse moral mathematics,\u201d he explains, \u201cis part of the reason why governments and individuals care more about a little girl stuck in a well than about events that will affect millions.\u201d\u201cAgainst Empathy\u201d covers a great deal of ticklish turf, from neuroscience to political science, from Jesus Christ to Adolf Hitler. But the most emotionally resonant for me was his chapter about empathy in intimate relationships.If you live in a state of hypercommunion with others, you run the risk of emotional depletion \u2014 or \u201cempathetic distress,\u201d as a psychologist might say. It\u2019s useless in the face of suffering. Better to answer with compassion, which doesn\u2019t totally subsume the self.In this same chapter, however, I also found myself at my most disoriented \u2014 possibly because Mr. Bloom is at his loosest and most discursive, and possibly because it seems to be the one place where he is most amenable to empathy\u2019s charms. He seems to understand why people who\u2019ve been wronged would want an empathetic apology. And he writes approvingly of Adam Smith\u2019s observation that we should generally keep our good fortune to ourselves, because it will most likely excite envy, rather than shared elation, in our friends. But that\u2019s an empathetic reaction, is it not? Anticipating our friends\u2019 envy? So maybe empathy still has a place to stave it off\u2026? I wish he\u2019d said.It all makes you long \u2014 in a good way \u2014 for a comments section after the endnotes. Mr. Bloom has a nice feel for the untidiness of ethical thought.But of course political beliefs matter. Every four years, they matter a lot. This year, they mattered especially. If you believe the worst, the next four years will be low on both empathy and rational compassion. If so, our world won\u2019t be simply be post-truth. It will be post-moral.Against EmpathyThe Case for Rational CompassionBy Paul Bloom285 pages. Ecco. $26.99. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber\u2019s Value to Riders Is Clear. To Investors, It May Prove More Elusive.", "Date": "2016-12-22", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsThat makes Uber, valued at some $70 billion in private markets, sound a bit like Amazon. The $370 billion online retailer, which trades not far short of 100 times its skinny forecast earnings, achieves that outsize multiple partly on the belief that there\u2019s a sort of dial that the founder and boss, Jeff Bezos, can turn to stop giving consumers such good deals and slow down investment, making a huge profit suddenly appear.Perhaps the same applies to Uber, which is still losing $100 million per quarter even in its home market, The Information says, partly thanks to intense competition with its rival Lyft \u2014 not to mention aggressive market-share grabs from traditional taxis in big markets like New York City. To begin to justify its paper valuation, even at an Amazon- and Facebook-like enterprise value-to-Ebitda ratio of around 40, the company led by Travis Kalanick needs to turn its current loss into approaching $2 billion of positive Ebitda \u2014 a swing near $5 billion.With plenty of cash in the bank, Uber has time, and it is still expanding. But to help assess whether there is enough juice in its chosen markets, there is a concept in economics called the consumer surplus. It is a measure of the gap between what people are willing to pay for goods or services and what they actually pay.A group of economists under the auspices of the National Bureau of Economic Research, among them the \u201cFreakonomics\u201d co-author Steven Levitt, analyzed a trove of big data from Uber. Because of the way the company deploys what it calls surge pricing \u2014 higher fares at times of high demand \u2014 they were able to investigate passengers\u2019 sensitivity to prices.This allowed the economists to estimate the consumer surplus enjoyed by users of Uber\u2019s most-used UberX service across its four biggest American markets \u2014 Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco. They concluded that the surplus was $2.9 billion in 2015. Those cities made up 43 percent of the company\u2019s domestic gross bookings, so nationally the figure could be nearly $7 billion. The surplus is equivalent to 1.6 times what users actually paid, excluding surge pricing.Such a result implies there might be room for Uber to raise prices once it has saturated any given market, without taking away all the economic benefit customers currently enjoy. But it is not so simple given competition from both the likes of Lyft and taxi fleets.Take New York City. Add another assumption to the mix and divide the researchers\u2019 figure up according to city population, and the consumer surplus from UberX in the metropolis was about $1.5 billion last year.As for the Big Apple\u2019s iconic yellow taxis, another economist, Nicholas Buchholz at the University of Texas at Austin, used data that is now a few years old to conclude that the New York taxi industry generated a consumer surplus of some $260 million a year, with taxi industry profit amounting to an annual $1.6 billion.Looked at another way, there are 13,587 licensing medallions riveted to the hoods of yellow New York taxis. Near the peak, coinciding roughly with Mr. Buchholz\u2019s data, these were worth around $1.2 million each, according to statistics from New York\u2019s Taxi & Limousine Commission. Assume a capitalization multiple of 10 times, and that kind of price tag represents a proxy for profit over and above daily taxi running costs worth \u2014 reassuringly \u2014 around $1.6 billion a year.With Uber use exploding since then, it is not surprising that the near-monopoly riches available to taxi owners and operators have plunged. The value of a medallion has crashed to $500,000 or less. The same assumptions suggest the taxi industry now collects maybe $700 million a year over and above daily costs.The lost benefit has not all suddenly gone to taxi passengers. More likely, with the typical New York cab snagging roughly 10 percent fewer rides in 2015 than a year earlier, it has gone to Uber or, more accurately, to Uber\u2019s customers. The Silicon Valley interloper has also enlarged the market, adding far more rides than taxis have lost.Uber may choose to undercut taxis slightly, but it is about more than price. As Mr. Buchholz points out in his paper, traditional taxis forgo huge economic benefit by not being able to link customers waiting on street corners with empty vehicles \u2014 both geographically and in terms of matching overall demand and supply at any given time. Uber\u2019s app, its algorithms and the added twist of price flexibility help it capture this value.For now, Uber\u2019s Mr. Kalanick seems content for the gains to flow mainly to customers. Whether he has an Amazon-like knob to turn, though, is an open question. Taxis in New York and elsewhere are figuring out their own apps and algorithms to address the matching issue. And if Uber does put prices up, it will open the door for competitors. Above all, consumers like their surplus, and they became accustomed to it. Unless the company ends up with its own quasi-monopoly, grabbing a big chunk of that back for investors may prove a very bumpy road.Advertisement"}

Many companies are racing to bring on new A.I. talent to compete against one another.\u201cEvery major company realizes how essential A.I. is to what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Dr. Marcus said in an interview. \u201cBecause of the scale of data people are operating on, even the smallest gains in efficiency can turn out enormous changes at these companies, especially in terms of profit.\u201dMany of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest tech companies, such as Google and Facebook, have tried to commercialize artificial intelligence through the application of algorithms modeled largely on how the human brain functions. This method, called deep learning, leans heavily on the vast data sets that private technology companies own and that are used to train computers to do simple tasks, such as match patterns or recognize faces in photographs.Part of what drew Uber to Dr. Marcus\u2019s team is that his start-up is tackling artificial intelligence in a different way. Rather than taking just one approach like deep learning, Geometric Intelligence combines data scientists who use varying techniques to study artificial intelligence, including the Bayesian and \u201cevolutionary\u201d methods.Dr. Marcus, who helped found Geometric Intelligence in late 2014, said the gist of his philosophy goes something like this: Instead of training machines by feeding them enormous amounts of data, what if computers were capable of learning more like humans by extrapolating a system of rules from just a few or even a single example?Besides autonomous vehicles, Uber said it expected its A.I. Labs to apply its method to other tasks, including combating fraud, extracting information from street signs and learning to improve its mapping research and capabilities.\u201cWhen step function changes in this field occur, we\u2019re going to see very significant differences in how businesses run themselves,\u201d Jeff Holden, Uber\u2019s chief product officer, said in an interview. He said the A.I. Labs and Uber\u2019s Advanced Technologies Center, which is home to the company\u2019s self-driving car research, will work in tandem with each other.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very long time before a self-driving car will be able to make all the kinds of trips that Uber does every single day,\u201d Mr. Holden said. \u201cBut the answers to this are all going to come in the form of artificial intelligence.\u201dMr. Holden said recruiting A.I. research talent is highly competitive, especially as Google, Apple and Tesla are also developing self-driving cars or related projects.\u201cFrom a defensive perspective, if someone else develops them first, we\u2019re in trouble,\u201d he said.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the surname of a new co-director of Uber\u2019s in-house research arm on artificial intelligence. He is Zoubin Ghahramani, not Ghahraman.Advertisement"}

J. Abrams, Tyler Perry and Steven Spielberg. The men have agreed to join Atom\u2019s advisory board. Mr. Abrams and Mr. Perry are also stakeholders; Atom would not say whether Mr. Spielberg had become an investor.Mr. Perry, speaking by phone on Saturday, added, \u201cI\u2019m excited about this because I think it allows my audience to have a better moviegoing experience \u2014 easier, more social.\u201dMr. Abrams compared Atom to other breakthrough technology companies. \u201cIt\u2019s like before there was Uber,\u201d he said by phone on Friday. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know how badly you needed it.

It services about 15,000 screens in North America, with thousands more coming online in the months ahead. \u201cBy this time next year, we will have mopped up most of the rest,\u201d said Ameesh Paleja, Atom\u2019s chief executive. (There are about 43,000 domestic movie screens in total.)\u201cThe market needed shaking up,\u201d said Matthew Bakal, Atom\u2019s chairman, noting that even Universal Pictures, a corporate cousin to Fandango, recently contacted Atom to discuss a potential promotional partnership.Atom, which has $60 million in funding from Lions Gate, 20th Century Fox and Disney, also learns which theaters users tend to frequent and with whom, allowing people to easily extend digital invitations to friends and family members for future group outings. Because Atom facilitates payment splitting among multiple people, \u201cone poor goat isn\u2019t stuck buying tickets for everyone,\u201d as Mr. Paleja put it.Free to download, Atom collects a surcharge on ticket sales. Studios can also hire it to promote certain films.Atom had hoped that its app would result in a 2 to 5 percent increase in ticket sales and concession orders for its theater partners. Early results indicate that some theaters have instead seen \u201cdouble-digit percentage growth,\u201d Mr. Bakal said. More than 80 percent of Atom users are 18 to 39.Mr. Paleja, who previously worked at Amazon, where he helped introduce Prime Instant Video, said he hopes that the megaphones offered by Mr. Spielberg, Mr. Abrams and Mr. Perry will result in more growth.\u201cWe\u2019re the new guys on the block,\u201d he said, \u201cand they give us legitimacy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Restless Quest for a Good Night\u2019s Sleep", "Date": "2016-12-28", "News": "Supported byIf you are reading this at 3 a.m., chances are that James Proud wants to put you in a deep slumber.As the inventor of the sleep-tracking device Sense, Mr. Proud has enjoyed heady success in the quickly growing sleep tech field: Sense\u2019s 2014 Kickstarter campaign raised about $2.4 million even though the goal was only $100,000.\u201cI\u2019m fascinated by helping people live better,\u201d said Mr. Proud, 25, a British citizen who came to the United States via the Thiel Fellowship, which gives entrepreneurs $100,000 for skipping college. \u201cAnd sleep is the foundation of everything. So it\u2019s the best place to start.\u201dInsomnia and other temporary and recurring sleep disorders affect 50 million to 70 million Americans, according to the National Institutes of Health, and the effects only worsen as people grow older. Technology, while still nascent, is an alternative for those who do not want to take sleeping pills, which can be highly addictive.Like many other tech devices that monitor every twitch and turn of the human body, Sense uses sensors to collect reams of data. The information is then uploaded to a smartphone app that analyzes sleep cycles. An accelerometer about the size of a quarter attaches to a pillow and tracks tosses and turns. And a bedside hub, shaped like a ball, tracks sounds, light and temperature in a room. It glows green when sleep conditions are optimal.\u201cYou can fall into bed drunk and it still works,\u201d said Mr. Proud, a self-taught programmer.All are trying to solve an age-old problem with new technologies that experts say are still mostly unproven.Yet, experts agree that the market is huge and important. About half the United States population will have insomnia on any given night, Dr. Kline said.\u201cA huge slice of society would be interested in this technology,\u201d Dr. Kline said.The company invented a system that tracks time awake, breathing rate and number of tosses and turns through a mattress cover embedded with sensors. An app then \u201cgrades\u201d users\u2019 sleep, allowing them to adjust their sleeping habits.\u201cWe provide insight to users,\u201d said Mr. Franceschetti, a serial entrepreneur who started two clean-tech companies in the last several years. \u201cIt\u2019s partly education.\u201dEight, based in New York, now has 17 employees. It has raised $6.5 million so far from Y Combinator, Comcast Ventures, Azure Capital Partners and others.\u201cEveryone knows about nutrition and fitness,\u201d said Paul Ferris, general partner at Azure Capital Partners. \u201cSleep is the third pillar.\u201dThe rapid rise of wearable fitness trackers like Fitbit, he added, helped set up a fire hose of data that consumers could harness to track behavior.Early adopters like Alex Muir, a tech support analyst who works at a New York private school, are helping test these early sleep technologies. Last year, he contributed $199 to Eight\u2019s Indiegogo campaign, and got the company\u2019s smart cover, hub and app.\u201cEight is helping me identify what\u2019s going on with my sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s colder, I get a better night\u2019s sleep, and I can see that in the app.\u201dMr. Muir acknowledges that technology alone can\u2019t solve problems with sleep. \u201cIt can provide a baseline of information, though,\u201d he said.Some who study sleep, however, say sensors and technology do not necessarily solve the underlying problems of insomnia.\u201cSleep sensors are feeding back inaccurate information,\u201d said Hawley Montgomery-Downs, a sleep expert and an associate professor of psychology at West Virginia University. \u201cThey\u2019re telling people they sleep better than they do.\u201dAdditionally, she said, no federal regulations or standards govern the sleep tech niche.\u201cThe industry is screaming for grown-ups to come along,\u201d she said. \u201cBut sleep is sexy and lucrative. So people need to ask questions about empirical evidence for these apps.\u201dExperts add that sleep apps also collect lots of data that is not then interpreted. \u201cThe devices can show you when you\u2019re awake,\u201d Dr. Kline said. \u201cBut they don\u2019t tell you why. So the technology can\u2019t help consumers fix all their sleep problems.\u201dIn the sleep field, wearables may be the toughest sell. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to wear wearables at night because most people take technology off,\u201d said Mr. Proud, who also tried out his product, Sense, as a wearable. \u201cSilicon Valley is arrogant and gets it wrong sometimes.\u201dBarak Kassar\u2019s experience with a wearable is a case in point. When worn at night, it gathered sleep data and sent it to an app.But Mr. Kassar quickly found out that the data collected wasn\u2019t useful. He learned \u201cthat I wake up in the middle of the night, which showed up on the graph on my phone,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I already knew that.\u201d Now he wears the modernistic-looking device as jewelry.However, recent research does show that online cognitive behavior therapies can help restore sleep. After Peter Hames developed insomnia, his doctor in England prescribed sleeping pills.\u201cDrugs have had a monopoly on evidence-based health care,\u201d Mr. Hames said. Instead, he turned to a course in cognitive behavior therapy developed by an expert, which cured him in six weeks.So far, the company has raised $15 million from backers like Kaiser Permanente Ventures and Octopus Ventures, based in London. It has a 25-person team, including three clinical researchers. Clients include big employers like LinkedIn and Comcast, which pay for a year\u2019s access.\u201cWe synthesize the world\u2019s best experts,\u201d he said. \u201cOther apps have been toys, not true medicine.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Verizon Can\u2019t Quit Yahoo", "Date": "2016-12-20", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorIt\u2019s time that we stopped beating up on Yahoo.All of these people are buying into the easy narrative that Yahoo is a loser in the tech industry, unable to keep up with the likes of relative newcomers like Snap. Their conclusion is that Yahoo is simply getting what it deserves as its core business melts away and the company goes through one management change after another. The current chief executive, Marissa Mayer, is only the latest.But if you dig into Yahoo\u2019s numbers, the business, once in rapid decline, is stabilizing. There has yet to be any significant sign that this hacking or the previously announced one have materially affected Yahoo\u2019s earnings or revenue.Given this, it seems that talk of Verizon being able to walk away from the Yahoo deal is overblown.Yahoo earned $229 million in the third quarter, before income, taxes, depreciation and amortization, with revenue of $858 million (both adjusted to take into account acquisition costs and other one-time earnings.)These numbers were hailed as pretty good, within the midrange of Yahoo\u2019s estimates for 2016. Yahoo\u2019s free cash flow was also $167 million, up from $18 million in the third quarter of 2015. Ms. Mayer has tried to refocus Yahoo\u2019s business on the so-called Mavens (mobile, video, native and social). Here, the company appears to be stable. Mavens revenue has gone from almost nothing in 2012 to $385 million in the 2016 third quarter. That was down 4 percent from 2015, but largely because of declines in video with the three other segments growing modestly.Given Yahoo\u2019s more than one billion monthly active users and that there is so much uncertainty surrounding its business, it is hard not to view Verizon\u2019s deal as a bargain at $4.8 billion. Snap has only 150 million active users and is being hyped as going public with a $25 billion valuation at 25 times forecast revenue (Yahoo\u2019s buyout price is only about six times current revenue).In the case of the Yahoo hackings, it doesn\u2019t appear that this threshold has been met.It is hard to see Yahoo incurring higher costs. These breaches happened more than three years ago. It is difficult to know or even trace any bad effect given the passage of time. Even if you could trace the effect, the hacked information in many cases is stale or unimportant. Yahoo said it included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, passwords and possibly encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers. In the last three years, much of this information has changed, though admittedly birth dates have not.Of course, this doesn\u2019t mean that Verizon isn\u2019t pursuing the possibility of using the material adverse effect clause to alter the deal terms. This is M&A Strategy 101. Verizon will most likely request as much information as possible from Yahoo to slow things down and make Yahoo nervous. According to the playbook, it will eventually claim that Yahoo is not complying with these information requests. That\u2019s probably what is going on now behind the scenes.If Verizon is pursuing this strategy, it is doing so to cajole Yahoo\u2019s board into cutting $1 billion to $2 billion off the deal price just to be done with the matter. Yahoo\u2019s market capitalization of $36.9 billion, because of its ownership of a minority stake in the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, makes $1 billion a rounding error.The parties have incentives, therefore, to simply recut the deal and lower the price or have Yahoo explicitly assume the direct liabilities related to the hacking. In Yahoo\u2019s case the biggest incentive is simply to end its long nightmare and move on.But I\u2019m hoping that Yahoo stays firm. Of all the internet 1.0 businesses \u2014 Lycos, Kozmo.com, broadcast.com, pets.com \u2014 Yahoo and Amazon are the only ones still standing. It is a credit to both companies, but also evidence that for all her faults, Ms. Mayer has stabilized a troubled business. And if the Yahooers actually believe this, Verizon will not have much to stand on.If Yahoo stands firm right now and no new bad facts come out, Verizon will have to close or be forced by a court to do so. That Yahoo hasn\u2019t already sued to force a closing shows how gun-shy the company has become.For the rest of us, we will have to wait. In the meantime, we should change our passwords.Steven Davidoff Solomon is a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley. His columns can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook.

{"Headline": "Big Beautiful Books for Small People", "Date": "2016-12-01", "News": "Supported byChildren\u2019s BooksArriving at a moment when they seem perhaps especially welcome, these six large-format books might provide a bit of escape for young readers and grown-ups alike. They remind us that literature can be at least as strange and interesting as reality, and that, though there is more than enough despair and ugliness to go around, there is also \u2014 still \u2014 hope and beauty and imagination to spare.A bold, graphic slipcase protects this delicious bubble-gum-pink-covered collection. Inside: Ungerer is everywhere. His energetic sketches fill the endpapers. His idiosyncratic script is used for the titles and typefaces. His quotations introduce each story. The layout is simple but ingenious and gives nearly all the space to the delightful, exuberant illustrations. They leap out at you from large, thick pages that have the smell and texture of construction paper. The stories themselves are always surprising and funny. Each has a moral like a modern Aesop\u2019s fable. There\u2019s \u201cThe Three Robbers,\u201d who turn good because of a little girl named Tiffany; there\u2019s \u201cMoon Man,\u201d who learns that the home he was so desperate to leave, good or bad, was the place he most belonged. In his wonderfully warm letter to the reader, Ungerer says that he \u201clived through a war as a child, and saw a lot of terrible things. This is why I loathe injustice, violence and discrimination, and I long for respect and peace. I think it\u2019s very important to pass these values on, and hope it shows in my books.\u201d His are the kind of great books that continue to influence and inspire children to think hard \u2014 and, we hope, to grow up into respectful, peaceful people.This dazzling and delightful \u201cseek and find\u201d book harkens to Maira Kalman\u2019s Max series with its whimsical drawings and unpredictable color combinations. \u201cThe Lost House\u201d could be an adventurous spread from an architecture magazine: the creaky, drafty ancestral home of an eccentric Irish lord. The characters in this topsy-turvy world are Grandad and his two grandchildren, who seem to be a human/animal hybrid. They look like distant relatives of \u201cHello Kitty,\u201d but done in a wonderful Old World style. Each page is as beautiful and intriguing as the next. How long did Cronin sit crouched over his desk creating this splendid maze of architectural details, crooked antiques, knickknacks and other collectibles? It is great fun to search the monochromatic rooms for Grandad\u2019s belongings, whether his socks in the green living room or his teeth in the yellow bathroom (I still haven\u2019t found them). The \u201cseek and find\u201d element is a clever way of coaxing the viewer to spend time with the illustrations, carefully combing every nook and cranny. I was always surprised by what I found \u2014 many objects I am sure Cronin has tucked away somewhere in his own home. The book\u2019s finale takes place in a texture-filled, pattern-splattered, eye-popping \u201csnuggery\u201d where I would like to live.Some cooks only glance at a recipe to get the gist, while others follow instructions to a T. This stylish board book promotes the latter with its simple, graphic illustrations that resemble paintings by Frank Stella. Kids can pretend to cook using this very book instead of a toy, and there are no stains or spills or crumbs. Not even drawings of them. When you pull a tab to \u201cpour\u201d milk or turn a wheel to \u201cwhisk\u201d the wet ingredients, it is clean, quiet and precise \u2014 like a Japanese tea ceremony. The book itself is a perfect square (think Josef Albers), fun and colorful. The most satisfying part is when you get to pop the little cardboard pancake out of the page, turn it, and press it into the next page to complete the illustration of a short stack of pancakes. The only problem is you can\u2019t actually eat them. For that, you must follow the recipe in the kitchen \u2014 where things might, finally, get messy.The concept is as simple as the title suggests: how to say hello. In more than 150 languages. This large lift-the-flap book transports readers from Europe to North America to South America to Asia to Africa and, finally, Australia and Oceania. The idea might be: All humans can be united by a single greeting. We go to the islands of Vanuatu in the Pacific to learn about Lemerig, a language spoken by only two living people. We go to Namibia to learn about !Kung-Ekoka, a musical language of nasal tones and palatal clicks. We go to the Amazon rain forest, where we learn of 400 known languages, and a few more we still may not know about. Each new \u201chello\u201d is a reminder of the complexity and diversity of humanity \u2014 and the immediacy of our connection. The last page warns us that by the end of the century, half of the world\u2019s languages may be lost. Will there be a time when humans all speak a single tongue? Well, as long as this book stays in print, at least one word\u2019s many translations will be remembered.\u201cNatural World\u201d reads like a book of make-believe. It consists entirely of charts that relate a collection of short stories: \u201cThe Mighty Saguaro\u201d; \u201cLife at the Ends of the Earth\u201d; \u201cHeavenly Dancers\u201d and so on. The hook is: They are all true. This is actually a reference book and a learning tool about science and nature. The illustrations resemble midcentury paintings that belong in a 1950s classroom or an old-fashioned natural history museum. Davey\u2019s drawings are charming and subdued and fill the pages with excellent compositions like \u201cChart No. 16: All About Feathers\u201d or \u201cChart No. 23: Bewildering Beetles.\u201d The reader can journey in continuity from start to finish or, alternatively, use the color-coded arrows to search freely for any particular subject matter. The book is filled with fun facts: how the Green Turtle travels a thousand miles to lay eggs on the beach where it was born; how the Tailorbird \u201csews\u201d together leaves to build its nest using \u201cplant fibers or spider silk\u201d; how the skin cells on the Blue-Ringed Octopus change color to camouflage or warn enemies. Words that have been attributed \u2014 falsely \u2014 to Chief Seattle in 1854 (they were actually written by a television scriptwriter in 1972) struck me as fitting for this book: \u201cWhat is man without the beasts? For if all the beasts were gone, man would die of a great loneliness of the spirit. For whatever happens to the beasts, soon happens to man. All things are connected.\u201dIf you always wished the Harry Potter series were illustrated, well, it is. In fact, Jim Kay is back for his second year at Hogwarts in \u201cThe Chamber of Secrets.\u201d I think Rowling has found her perfect match in Kay. He renders her elaborate vision in numerous vivid styles and variations. Some look like drawings from a dog-eared book of magic, some look like framed portraits by a Renaissance master, some look like stills from a movie. There are inky sketches and set-design renderings and scientific diagrams. Kay is an artist of great facility. I do not expect he would ever struggle to draw, for instance, a hand. (I do.) The illustrations I like best are the ones that catch you off-guard: a pencil sketch of Hermione in the library, a pastel of Hogwarts on a wintry night. This illustrated series will introduce Harry Potter to a younger audience. The very littlest ones might even look over the shoulder of an older sister or brother and be seduced by the glossy and masterly illustrations.Juman Malouf is the author and illustrator of the middle-grade novel \u201cThe Trilogy of Two.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Four Not-to-Miss Photography Shows", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "Supported byArt ReviewFrom kitchen sinks to chancellors and immigrants to burlesque queens, these four photography shows light up the season. Three are by contemporaries working in color, and one by a gifted amateur recording America\u2019s diversity in the early 20th century.People are implicit in these images, but no one\u2019s at home. Almost the only person on view is a young boy studying a double-page magazine spread of handguns, as if to tell us that conditions are changing, not necessarily for the better.Mr. Eggleston sees brilliant, saturated color in a chartreuse vacuum cleaner near a gold plastic laundry basket, a bit of a turquoise cabinet muscling in at one corner. Or a clump of red and yellow tomatoes beside a green sink, or, in a desolate, gray back alley, orange paint juxtaposed with rusty bricks and a building\u2019s decorative coral touches.The more things change, the more things stay the same.Photographs do not explain themselves; without captions, they are vulnerable to widely differing interpretations, often unintended by the photographer. Sherman\u2019s sympathetic portraits were used in anti-immigration publications, like Grose\u2019s book, without attribution. His pictures are sober, respectful, formal, nicely printed and centered on the subject, with mainly, but not exclusively, plain backgrounds that insist that the sitter is worth looking at \u2014 is, in fact, the only thing worth looking at. He took family portraits that speak to the enormous effort some made to get here. One family poses with nine children, eight of them boys. The parents look rather tired.The variety of headgear, costumes, decoration and jewelry is like a tour through Europe, Russia, parts of northern Africa and the Middle East early in the 20th century. What Sherman has photographed is the diversity of America as it defined itself, as it developed a century ago.Resourceful enough to get here, most immigrants did all right, if only in menial jobs. There is a story about an Italian man who said he came because he heard the streets were paved with gold, only to discover that not only weren\u2019t they paved with gold but that they weren\u2019t paved at all \u2014 and that he was meant to pave them.Sherman photographed Americans to whom we owe a debt. They made this country richer in many ways, not merely by paving roads and shortening trousers. They were the promise of a melting pot that has never quite been fulfilled. This is how they looked before they stepped into a new life, most likely spent in tenements or trying to learn how to farm. Thanks to Sherman, we can look into the eyes of people who were aliens for a long-ago moment and acknowledge them as Americans just like us.Human beings, like many animals, find safety, comfort and socialization in groups. Families, tribes, book clubs, knitting circles, religious societies, or Rotarians, colleagues, poker players and members of a graduating class or a board: The group quickly becomes an essential element of personal identity. In 17th-century Holland, the municipal authorities were especially partial to group portraiture, which put the seal on their stature. When photography was invented, practitioners wanted to photograph groups right away, but it wasn\u2019t easy. Families wanted to be memorialized and sometimes, when the baby stopped crying, and the dog stopped chewing the furniture, they were.Mr. Slavin is not only a clever, and possibly sly, persuader with a gift for color and lighting, but also a talented stage manager who can position any group as a lucid explanation of what it does, or as a symbol of itself, as a comic opera, or as a bundle of unexpected redundancies.

One chancellor interrupts Newman\u2019s strict, flat, painted surface by sending across it a rococo swirl of cigarette smoke.Mr. Gursky comments on a more contemporary kind of sublime heroism in photographs that feature Marvel comic heroes. In one, in a kind of technological update of King Kong, the all-metal Iron Man embraces an adoring blond woman in a landscape of palm trees that could be an ad for Caribbean vacations, were it not for the sulfurous pink atmosphere.Three seemingly abstract, multicolored stripe paintings look as if some industrious child had carefully colored in the spaces in paintings by Agnes Martin. Only at a myopic distance from the images do they explain themselves as aerial photographs of rows of cultivated tulips.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Carrie Fisher, Child of Hollywood and \u2018Star Wars\u2019 Royalty, Dies at 60", "Date": "2016-12-27", "News": "Supported by13 PhotosCarrie Fisher, the actress, author and screenwriter who brought a rare combination of nerve, grit and hopefulness to her most indelible role, as Princess Leia in the \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie franchise, died on Tuesday morning. She was 60.A family spokesman, Simon Halls, said Ms. Fisher died at 8:55 a.m. She had a heart attack on a flight from London to Los Angeles on Friday and had been hospitalized in Los Angeles.After her \u201cStar Wars\u201d success, Ms. Fisher, the daughter of the pop singer Eddie Fisher and the actress Debbie Reynolds, went on to use her perch among Hollywood royalty to offer wry commentary in her books on the paradoxes and absurdities of the entertainment industry.\u201cStar Wars,\u201d released in 1977, turned her overnight into an international movie star. The film, written and directed by George Lucas, traveled around the world, breaking box-office records. It proved to be the first installment of a blockbuster series whose vivid, even preposterous characters \u2014 living \u201ca long time ago in a galaxy far, far away,\u201d as the opening sequence announced \u2014 became pop culture legends and the progenitors of a merchandising bonanza.Ms. Fisher established Princess Leia as a damsel who could very much deal with her own distress, whether facing down the villainy of the dreaded Darth Vader or the romantic interests of the roguish smuggler Han Solo.Wielding blaster pistols, piloting futuristic vehicles and, to her occasional chagrin, wearing strange hairdos and a revealing metal bikini, she reprised the role in three more films \u2014 \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back\u201d in 1980, \u201cReturn of the Jedi\u201d in 1983 and, 32 years later, \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens,\u201d by which time Leia had become a hard-bitten general.Lucasfilm said on Tuesday that Ms. Fisher had completed her work in an as-yet-untitled eighth episode of the main \u201cStar Wars\u201d saga, which is scheduled to be released in December 2017.Winning the admiration of countless fans, Ms. Fisher never played Leia as helpless. She had the toughness to escape the clutches of the monstrous gangster Jabba the Hutt and the tenderness to tell Han Solo, as he is about to be frozen in carbonite, \u201cI love you.\u201d (Solo, played by Harrison Ford, caddishly replies, \u201cI know.\u201d)Having seen fame\u2019s light and dark sides, Ms. Fisher did not take it too seriously, or consider it an enduring commodity.As she wrote in \u201cThe Princess Diarist\u201d:\u201cPerpetual celebrity \u2014 the kind where any mention of you will interest a significant percentage of the public until the day you die, even if that day comes decades after your last real contribution to the culture \u2014 is exceedingly rare, reserved for the likes of Muhammad Ali.\u201dCarrie Frances Fisher was born on Oct. 21, 1956, in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was the first child of her highly visible parents (they later had a son, Todd), and said in \u201cWishful Drinking\u201d that, while her mother was under anesthetic delivering her, her father fainted.\u201cSo when I arrived,\u201d Ms. Fisher wrote, \u201cI was virtually unattended! And I have been trying to make up for that fact ever since.\u201dIn 1959, Ms. Reynolds divorced Eddie Fisher in the wake of his affair with Elizabeth Taylor, whom he married that same year. (Ms. Taylor later left him to marry Richard Burton.)\u201cStar Wars\u201d became a financial and cultural phenomenon, launching more movies and a merchandising machine that splashed Ms. Fisher\u2019s likeness on all manner of action figures and products while casting her into an uneasy limelight.As its lyrics go:In \u201cThe Princess Diarist,\u201d she admitted what many fans had long suspected: During the filming of the first \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie, she and Harrison Ford (who was married at the time) had an affair.In 1985, after filming a role in Woody Allen\u2019s \u201cHannah and Her Sisters,\u201d she had a nearly fatal drug overdose. She had her stomach pumped and checked herself into a 30-day rehab program in Los Angeles. Those experiences later became grist for her caustic, comic novel \u201cPostcards From the Edge,\u201d whose chapters are variously presented as letters, diary entries, monologues and third-person narratives.As the main character, Suzanne, writes of her rehab stay: \u201cMom brought me some peanut butter cookies and a biography of Judy Garland. She told me she thought my problem was that I was too impatient, my fuse was too short, that I was only interested in instant gratification. I said, \u2018Instant gratification takes too long.\u2019\u201dThe book was later made into a movie, directed by Mike Nichols from a script by Ms. Fisher. Released in 1990, it starred Meryl Streep as Suzanne and Shirley MacLaine as her movie-star mother.On film, Ms. Fisher also played the scene-stealing best friend of Meg Ryan\u2019s title character in the 1989 romantic comedy \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u2026\u201d On television, she played satirical versions of herself on shows like \u201cSex and the City\u201d and \u201cThe Big Bang Theory.\u201d She had a recurring role on the British comedy \u201cCatastrophe\u201d (seen here on Amazon) as the mother of the character played by Rob Delaney, one of the show\u2019s creators.Her survivors include her mother; her brother, Todd; her daughter, Billie Lourd, from a relationship with the talent agent Bryan Lourd; and her half sisters, Joely Fisher and Tricia Leigh Fisher, the daughters of Eddie Fisher and Connie Stevens.Ms. Fisher had a Dorothy Parker-like presence on Twitter, where she ruminated on the inexplicable mania surrounding \u201cStar Wars\u201d and on her French bulldog, Gary, in playful messages filled with emoji.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this obituary misspelled the surname of the spokesman who confirmed the death.

{"Headline": "The Great A.I. Awakening", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "FeatureHow Google used artificial intelligence to transform Google Translate, one of its more popular services \u2014 and how machine learning is poised to reinvent computing itself.Supported byLate one Friday night in early November, Jun Rekimoto, a distinguished professor of human-computer interaction at the University of Tokyo, was online preparing for a lecture when he began to notice some peculiar posts rolling in on social media. Apparently Google Translate, the company\u2019s popular machine-translation service, had suddenly and almost immeasurably improved. Rekimoto visited Translate himself and began to experiment with it. He was astonished. He had to go to sleep, but Translate refused to relax its grip on his imagination.Rekimoto wrote up his initial findings in a blog post. First, he compared a few sentences from two published versions of \u201cThe Great Gatsby,\u201d Takashi Nozaki\u2019s 1957 translation and Haruki Murakami\u2019s more recent iteration, with what this new Google Translate was able to produce. Murakami\u2019s translation is written \u201cin very polished Japanese,\u201d Rekimoto explained to me later via email, but the prose is distinctively \u201cMurakami-style.\u201d By contrast, Google\u2019s translation \u2014 despite some \u201csmall unnaturalness\u201d \u2014 reads to him as \u201cmore transparent.\u201dThe second half of Rekimoto\u2019s post examined the service in the other direction, from Japanese to English. He dashed off his own Japanese interpretation of the opening to Hemingway\u2019s \u201cThe Snows of Kilimanjaro,\u201d then ran that passage back through Google into English. He published this version alongside Hemingway\u2019s original, and proceeded to invite his readers to guess which was the work of a machine.NO. 1:Kilimanjaro is a snow-covered mountain 19,710 feet high, and is said to be the highest mountain in Africa. Its western summit is called the Masai \u201cNgaje Ngai,\u201d the House of God. Close to the western summit there is the dried and frozen carcass of a leopard. No one has explained what the leopard was seeking at that altitude.NO. 2:Kilimanjaro is a mountain of 19,710 feet covered with snow and is said to be the highest mountain in Africa. The summit of the west is called \u201cNgaje Ngai\u201d in Masai, the house of God. Near the top of the west there is a dry and frozen dead body of leopard. No one has ever explained what leopard wanted at that altitude.Even to a native English speaker, the missing article on the leopard is the only real giveaway that No. 2 was the output of an automaton. Their closeness was a source of wonder to Rekimoto, who was well acquainted with the capabilities of the previous service. Only 24 hours earlier, Google would have translated the same Japanese passage as follows:Kilimanjaro is 19,710 feet of the mountain covered with snow, and it is said that the highest mountain in Africa. Top of the west, \u201cNgaje Ngai\u201d in the Maasai language, has been referred to as the house of God. The top close to the west, there is a dry, frozen carcass of a leopard. Whether the leopard had what the demand at that altitude, there is no that nobody explained.Rekimoto promoted his discovery to his hundred thousand or so followers on Twitter, and over the next few hours thousands of people broadcast their own experiments with the machine-translation service. Some were successful, others meant mostly for comic effect. As dawn broke over Tokyo, Google Translate was the No. 1 trend on Japanese Twitter, just above some cult anime series and the long-awaited new single from a girl-idol supergroup. Everybody wondered: How had Google Translate become so uncannily artful?Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, stood to make a few opening remarks. A friend, he began, had recently told him he reminded him of Google. \u201cWhy, because I know all the answers?\u201d the mayor asked. \u201cNo,\u201d the friend replied, \u201cbecause you\u2019re always trying to finish my sentences.\u201d The crowd tittered politely. Khan concluded by introducing Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, who took the stage.Pichai was in London in part to inaugurate Google\u2019s new building there, the cornerstone of a new \u201cknowledge quarter\u201d under construction at King\u2019s Cross, and in part to unveil the completion of the initial phase of a company transformation he announced last year. The Google of the future, Pichai had said on several occasions, was going to be \u201cA.I. first.\u201d What that meant in theory was complicated and had welcomed much speculation. What it meant in practice, with any luck, was that soon the company\u2019s products would no longer represent the fruits of traditional computer programming, exactly, but \u201cmachine learning.\u201dA rarefied department within the company, Google Brain, was founded five years ago on this very principle: that artificial \u201cneural networks\u201d that acquaint themselves with the world via trial and error, as toddlers do, might in turn develop something like human flexibility. This notion is not new \u2014 a version of it dates to the earliest stages of modern computing, in the 1940s \u2014 but for much of its history most computer scientists saw it as vaguely disreputable, even mystical. Since 2011, though, Google Brain has demonstrated that this approach to artificial intelligence could solve many problems that confounded decades of conventional efforts. Speech recognition didn\u2019t work very well until Brain undertook an effort to revamp it; the application of machine learning made its performance on Google\u2019s mobile platform, Android, almost as good as human transcription. The same was true of image recognition. Less than a year ago, Brain for the first time commenced with the gut renovation of an entire consumer product, and its momentous results were being celebrated tonight.Translate made its debut in 2006 and since then has become one of Google\u2019s most reliable and popular assets; it serves more than 500 million monthly users in need of 140 billion words per day in a different language. It exists not only as its own stand-alone app but also as an integrated feature within Gmail, Chrome and many other Google offerings, where we take it as a push-button given \u2014 a frictionless, natural part of our digital commerce. It was only with the refugee crisis, Pichai explained from the lectern, that the company came to reckon with Translate\u2019s geopolitical importance: On the screen behind him appeared a graph whose steep curve indicated a recent fivefold increase in translations between Arabic and German. (It was also close to Pichai\u2019s own heart. He grew up in India, a land divided by dozens of languages.) The team had been steadily adding new languages and features, but gains in quality over the last four years had slowed considerably.Until today. As of the previous weekend, Translate had been converted to an A.I.-based system for much of its traffic, not just in the United States but in Europe and Asia as well: The rollout included translations between English and Spanish, French, Portuguese, German, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Turkish. The rest of Translate\u2019s hundred-odd languages were to come, with the aim of eight per month, by the end of next year. The new incarnation, to the pleasant surprise of Google\u2019s own engineers, had been completed in only nine months. The A.I. system had demonstrated overnight improvements roughly equal to the total gains the old one had accrued over its entire lifetime.Grinning, Pichai read aloud an awkward English version of the sentence that had been rendered by the old Translate system: \u201cOne is not what is for what he writes, but for what he has read.\u201dTo the right of that was a new A.I.-rendered version: \u201cYou are not what you write, but what you have read.\u201dIt was a fitting remark: The new Google Translate was run on the first machines that had, in a sense, ever learned to read anything at all.The phrase \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d is invoked as if its meaning were self-evident, but it has always been a source of confusion and controversy. Imagine if you went back to the 1970s, stopped someone on the street, pulled out a smartphone and showed her Google Maps. Once you managed to convince her you weren\u2019t some oddly dressed wizard, and that what you withdrew from your pocket wasn\u2019t a black-arts amulet but merely a tiny computer more powerful than the one that guided Apollo missions, Google Maps would almost certainly seem to her a persuasive example of \u201cartificial intelligence.\u201d In a very real sense, it is. It can do things any map-literate human can manage, like get you from your hotel to the airport \u2014 though it can do so much more quickly and reliably. It can also do things that humans simply and obviously cannot: It can evaluate the traffic, plan the best route and reorient itself when you take the wrong exit.Practically nobody today, however, would bestow upon Google Maps the honorific \u201cA.I.,\u201d so sentimental and sparing are we in our use of the word \u201cintelligence.\u201d Artificial intelligence, we believe, must be something that distinguishes HAL from whatever it is a loom or wheelbarrow can do. The minute we can automate a task, we downgrade the relevant skill involved to one of mere mechanism. Today Google Maps seems, in the pejorative sense of the term, robotic: It simply accepts an explicit demand (the need to get from one place to another) and tries to satisfy that demand as efficiently as possible. The goal posts for \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d are thus constantly receding.The new wave of A.I.-enhanced assistants \u2014 Apple\u2019s Siri, Facebook\u2019s M, Amazon\u2019s Echo \u2014 are all creatures of machine learning, built with similar intentions. The corporate dreams for machine learning, however, aren\u2019t exhausted by the goal of consumer clairvoyance. A medical-imaging subsidiary of Samsung announced this year that its new ultrasound devices could detect breast cancer. Management consultants are falling all over themselves to prep executives for the widening industrial applications of computers that program themselves. DeepMind, a 2014 Google acquisition, defeated the reigning human grandmaster of the ancient board game Go, despite predictions that such an achievement would take another 10 years.It is, in fact, three overlapping stories that converge in Google Translate\u2019s successful metamorphosis to A.I. \u2014 a technical story, an institutional story and a story about the evolution of ideas. The technical story is about one team on one product at one company, and the process by which they refined, tested and introduced a brand-new version of an old product in only about a quarter of the time anyone, themselves included, might reasonably have expected. The institutional story is about the employees of a small but influential artificial-intelligence group within that company, and the process by which their intuitive faith in some old, unproven and broadly unpalatable notions about computing upended every other company within a large radius. The story of ideas is about the cognitive scientists, psychologists and wayward engineers who long toiled in obscurity, and the process by which their ostensibly irrational convictions ultimately inspired a paradigm shift in our understanding not only of technology but also, in theory, of consciousness itself.The first story, the story of Google Translate, takes place in Mountain View over nine months, and it explains the transformation of machine translation. The second story, the story of Google Brain and its many competitors, takes place in Silicon Valley over five years, and it explains the transformation of that entire community. The third story, the story of deep learning, takes place in a variety of far-flung laboratories \u2014 in Scotland, Switzerland, Japan and most of all Canada \u2014 over seven decades, and it might very well contribute to the revision of our self-image as first and foremost beings who think.All three are stories about artificial intelligence. The seven-decade story is about what we might conceivably expect or want from it. The five-year story is about what it might do in the near future. The nine-month story is about what it can do right this minute. These three stories are themselves just proof of concept. All of this is only the beginning.One day in early 2011, Dean walked into one of the Google campus\u2019s \u201cmicrokitchens\u201d \u2014 the \u201cGoogley\u201d word for the shared break spaces on most floors of the Mountain View complex\u2019s buildings \u2014 and ran into Andrew Ng, a young Stanford computer-science professor who was working for the company as a consultant. Ng told him about Project Marvin, an internal effort (named after the celebrated A.I. pioneer Marvin Minsky) he had recently helped establish to experiment with \u201cneural networks,\u201d pliant digital lattices based loosely on the architecture of the brain. Dean himself had worked on a primitive version of the technology as an undergraduate at the University of Minnesota in 1990, during one of the method\u2019s brief windows of mainstream acceptability. Now, over the previous five years, the number of academics working on neural networks had begun to grow again, from a handful to a few dozen. Ng told Dean that Project Marvin, which was being underwritten by Google\u2019s secretive X lab, had already achieved some promising results.Dean was intrigued enough to lend his \u201c20 percent\u201d \u2014 the portion of work hours every Google employee is expected to contribute to programs outside his or her core job \u2014 to the project. Pretty soon, he suggested to Ng that they bring in another colleague with a neuroscience background, Greg Corrado. (In graduate school, Corrado was taught briefly about the technology, but strictly as a historical curiosity. \u201cIt was good I was paying attention in class that day,\u201d he joked to me.) In late spring they brought in one of Ng\u2019s best graduate students, Quoc Le, as the project\u2019s first intern. By then, a number of the Google engineers had taken to referring to Project Marvin by another name: Google Brain.There are two main problems with the old-fashioned approach. The first is that it\u2019s awfully time-consuming on the human end. The second is that it only really works in domains where rules and definitions are very clear: in mathematics, for example, or chess. Translation, however, is an example of a field where this approach fails horribly, because words cannot be reduced to their dictionary definitions, and because languages tend to have as many exceptions as they have rules. More often than not, a system like this is liable to translate \u201cminister of agriculture\u201d as \u201cpriest of farming.\u201d Still, for math and chess it worked great, and the proponents of symbolic A.I. took it for granted that no activities signaled \u201cgeneral intelligence\u201d better than math and chess.There were, however, limits to what this system could do. In the 1980s, a robotics researcher at Carnegie Mellon pointed out that it was easy to get computers to do adult things but nearly impossible to get them to do things a 1-year-old could do, like hold a ball or identify a cat. By the 1990s, despite punishing advancements in computer chess, we still weren\u2019t remotely close to artificial general intelligence.There has always been another vision for A.I. \u2014 a dissenting view \u2014 in which the computers would learn from the ground up (from data) rather than from the top down (from rules). This notion dates to the early 1940s, when it occurred to researchers that the best model for flexible automated intelligence was the brain itself. A brain, after all, is just a bunch of widgets, called neurons, that either pass along an electrical charge to their neighbors or don\u2019t. What\u2019s important are less the individual neurons themselves than the manifold connections among them. This structure, in its simplicity, has afforded the brain a wealth of adaptive advantages. The brain can operate in circumstances in which information is poor or missing; it can withstand significant damage without total loss of control; it can store a huge amount of knowledge in a very efficient way; it can isolate distinct patterns but retain the messiness necessary to handle ambiguity.This attitude toward artificial intelligence was evolutionary rather than creationist. If you wanted a flexible mechanism, you wanted one that could adapt to its environment. If you wanted something that could adapt, you didn\u2019t want to begin with the indoctrination of the rules of chess. You wanted to begin with very basic abilities \u2014 sensory perception and motor control \u2014 in the hope that advanced skills would emerge organically. Humans don\u2019t learn to understand language by memorizing dictionaries and grammar books, so why should we possibly expect our computers to do so?Google Brain was the first major commercial institution to invest in the possibilities embodied by this way of thinking about A.I. Dean, Corrado and Ng began their work as a part-time, collaborative experiment, but they made immediate progress. They took architectural inspiration for their models from recent theoretical outlines \u2014 as well as ideas that had been on the shelf since the 1980s and 1990s \u2014 and drew upon both the company\u2019s peerless reserves of data and its massive computing infrastructure. They instructed the networks on enormous banks of \u201clabeled\u201d data \u2014 speech files with correct transcriptions, for example \u2014 and the computers improved their responses to better match reality.\u201cThe portion of evolution in which animals developed eyes was a big development,\u201d Dean told me one day, with customary understatement. We were sitting, as usual, in a whiteboarded meeting room, on which he had drawn a crowded, snaking timeline of Google Brain and its relation to inflection points in the recent history of neural networks. \u201cNow computers have eyes. We can build them around the capabilities that now exist to understand photos. Robots will be drastically transformed. They\u2019ll be able to operate in an unknown environment, on much different problems.\u201d These capacities they were building may have seemed primitive, but their implications were profound.A great preponderance of these extant and neglected notions had been proposed or refined by a peripatetic English polymath named Geoffrey Hinton. In the second year of Brain\u2019s existence, Hinton was recruited to Brain as Andrew Ng left. (Ng now leads the 1,300-person A.I. team at Baidu.) Hinton wanted to leave his post at the University of Toronto for only three months, so for arcane contractual reasons he had to be hired as an intern. At intern training, the orientation leader would say something like, \u201cType in your LDAP\u201d \u2014 a user login \u2014 and he would flag a helper to ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s an LDAP?\u201d All the smart 25-year-olds in attendance, who had only ever known deep learning as the sine qua non of artificial intelligence, snickered: \u201cWho is that old guy? Why doesn\u2019t he get it?\u201d\u201cAt lunchtime,\u201d Hinton said, \u201csomeone in the queue yelled: \u2018Professor Hinton! I took your course! What are you doing here?\u2019 After that, it was all right.\u201dHinton comes from one of those old British families emblazoned like the Darwins at eccentric angles across the intellectual landscape, where regardless of titular preoccupation a person is expected to make sideline contributions to minor problems in astronomy or fluid dynamics. His great-great-grandfather was George Boole, whose foundational work in symbolic logic underpins the computer; another great-great-grandfather was a celebrated surgeon, his father a venturesome entomologist, his father\u2019s cousin a Los Alamos researcher; the list goes on. He trained at Cambridge and Edinburgh, then taught at Carnegie Mellon before he ended up at Toronto, where he still spends half his time. (His work has long been supported by the largess of the Canadian government.) I visited him in his office at Google there. He has tousled yellowed-pewter hair combed forward in a mature Noel Gallagher style and wore a baggy striped dress shirt that persisted in coming untucked, and oval eyeglasses that slid down to the tip of a prominent nose. He speaks with a driving if shambolic wit, and says things like, \u201cComputers will understand sarcasm before Americans do.\u201dHinton had been working on neural networks since his undergraduate days at Cambridge in the late 1960s, and he is seen as the intellectual primogenitor of the contemporary field. For most of that time, whenever he spoke about machine learning, people looked at him as though he were talking about the Ptolemaic spheres or bloodletting by leeches. Neural networks were taken as a disproven folly, largely on the basis of one overhyped project: the Perceptron, an artificial neural network that Frank Rosenblatt, a Cornell psychologist, developed in the late 1950s. The New York Times reported that the machine\u2019s sponsor, the United States Navy, expected it would \u201cbe able to walk, talk, see, write, reproduce itself and be conscious of its existence.\u201d It went on to do approximately none of those things. Marvin Minsky, the dean of artificial intelligence in America, had worked on neural networks for his 1954 Princeton thesis, but he\u2019d since grown tired of the inflated claims that Rosenblatt \u2014 who was a contemporary at Bronx Science \u2014 made for the neural paradigm. (He was also competing for Defense Department funding.) Along with an M.I.T. colleague, Minsky published a book that proved that there were painfully simple problems the Perceptron could never solve.The issue with multilayered, \u201cdeep\u201d neural networks was that the trial-and-error part got extraordinarily complicated. In a single layer, it\u2019s easy. Imagine that you\u2019re playing with a child. You tell the child, \u201cPick up the green ball and put it into Box A.\u201d The child picks up a green ball and puts it into Box B. You say, \u201cTry again to put the green ball in Box A.\u201d The child tries Box A. Bravo.These ideas remained popular, however, among philosophers and psychologists, who called it \u201cconnectionism\u201d or \u201cparallel distributed processing.\u201d \u201cThis idea,\u201d Hinton told me, \u201cof a few people keeping a torch burning, it\u2019s a nice myth. It was true within artificial intelligence. But within psychology lots of people believed in the approach but just couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d Neither could Hinton, despite the generosity of the Canadian government. \u201cThere just wasn\u2019t enough computer power or enough data. People on our side kept saying, \u2018Yeah, but if I had a really big one, it would work.\u2019\u2009It wasn\u2019t a very persuasive argument.\u201dTo understand why scale is so important, however, you have to start to understand some of the more technical details of what, exactly, machine intelligences are doing with the data they consume. A lot of our ambient fears about A.I. rest on the idea that they\u2019re just vacuuming up knowledge like a sociopathic prodigy in a library, and that an artificial intelligence constructed to make paper clips might someday decide to treat humans like ants or lettuce. This just isn\u2019t how they work. All they\u2019re doing is shuffling information around in search of commonalities \u2014 basic patterns, at first, and then more complex ones \u2014 and for the moment, at least, the greatest danger is that the information we\u2019re feeding them is biased in the first place.If that brief explanation seems sufficiently reassuring, the reassured nontechnical reader is invited to skip forward to the next section, which is about cats. If not, then read on. (This section is also, luckily, about cats.)Imagine you want to program a cat-recognizer on the old symbolic-A.I. model. You stay up for days preloading the machine with an exhaustive, explicit definition of \u201ccat.\u201d You tell it that a cat has four legs and pointy ears and whiskers and a tail, and so on. All this information is stored in a special place in memory called Cat. Now you show it a picture. First, the machine has to separate out the various distinct elements of the image. Then it has to take these elements and apply the rules stored in its memory. If(legs=4) and if(ears=pointy) and if(whiskers=yes) and if(tail=yes) and if(expression=supercilious), then(cat=yes). But what if you showed this cat-recognizer a Scottish Fold, a heart-rending breed with a prized genetic defect that leads to droopy doubled-over ears? Our symbolic A.I. gets to (ears=pointy) and shakes its head solemnly, \u201cNot cat.\u201d It is hyperliteral, or \u201cbrittle.\u201d Even the thickest toddler shows much greater inferential acuity.The reason that the network requires so many neurons and so much data is that it functions, in a way, like a sort of giant machine democracy. Imagine you want to train a computer to differentiate among five different items. Your network is made up of millions and millions of neuronal \u201cvoters,\u201d each of whom has been given five different cards: one for cat, one for dog, one for spider monkey, one for spoon and one for defibrillator. You show your electorate a photo and ask, \u201cIs this a cat, a dog, a spider monkey, a spoon or a defibrillator?\u201d All the neurons that voted the same way collect in groups, and the network foreman peers down from above and identifies the majority classification: \u201cA dog?\u201dYou say: \u201cNo, maestro, it\u2019s a cat. Try again.\u201dNow the network foreman goes back to identify which voters threw their weight behind \u201ccat\u201d and which didn\u2019t. The ones that got \u201ccat\u201d right get their votes counted double next time \u2014 at least when they\u2019re voting for \u201ccat.\u201d They have to prove independently whether they\u2019re also good at picking out dogs and defibrillators, but one thing that makes a neural network so flexible is that each individual unit can contribute differently to different desired outcomes. What\u2019s important is not the individual vote, exactly, but the pattern of votes. If Joe, Frank and Mary all vote together, it\u2019s a dog; but if Joe, Kate and Jessica vote together, it\u2019s a cat; and if Kate, Jessica and Frank vote together, it\u2019s a defibrillator. The neural network just needs to register enough of a regularly discernible signal somewhere to say, \u201cOdds are, this particular arrangement of pixels represents something these humans keep calling \u2018cats.\u2019\u2009\u201d The more \u201cvoters\u201d you have, and the more times you make them vote, the more keenly the network can register even very weak signals. If you have only Joe, Frank and Mary, you can maybe use them only to differentiate among a cat, a dog and a defibrillator. If you have millions of different voters that can associate in billions of different ways, you can learn to classify data with incredible granularity. Your trained voter assembly will be able to look at an unlabeled picture and identify it more or less accurately.Image-recognition networks like our cat-identifier are only one of many varieties of deep learning, but they are disproportionately invoked as teaching examples because each layer does something at least vaguely recognizable to humans \u2014 picking out edges first, then circles, then faces. This means there\u2019s a safeguard against error. For instance, an early oddity in Google\u2019s image-recognition software meant that it could not always identify a barbell in isolation, even though the team had trained it on an image set that included a lot of exercise categories. A visualization tool showed them the machine had learned not the concept of \u201cdumbbell\u201d but the concept of \u201cdumbbell+arm,\u201d because all the dumbbells in the training set were attached to arms. They threw into the training mix some photos of solo barbells. The problem was solved. Not everything is so easy.Over the course of its first year or two, Brain\u2019s efforts to cultivate in machines the skills of a 1-year-old were auspicious enough that the team was graduated out of the X lab and into the broader research organization. (The head of Google X once noted that Brain had paid for the entirety of X\u2019s costs.) They still had fewer than 10 people and only a vague sense for what might ultimately come of it all. But even then they were thinking ahead to what ought to happen next. First a human mind learns to recognize a ball and rests easily with the accomplishment for a moment, but sooner or later, it wants to ask for the ball. And then it wades into language.The lead author on the cat paper was Quoc Le. Le is short and willowy and soft-spoken, with a quick, enigmatic smile and shiny black penny loafers. He grew up outside Hue, Vietnam. His parents were rice farmers, and he did not have electricity at home. His mathematical abilities were obvious from an early age, and he was sent to study at a magnet school for science. In the late 1990s, while still in school, he tried to build a chatbot to talk to. He thought, How hard could this be?\u201cBut actually,\u201d he told me in a whispery deadpan, \u201cit\u2019s very hard.\u201d\u201cThere was a big debate,\u201d he told me. \u201cA very big debate.\u201d We were in a small interior conference room, a narrow, high-ceilinged space outfitted with only a small table and two whiteboards. He looked to the curve he\u2019d drawn on the whiteboard behind him and back again, then softly confided, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen such a big debate.\u201dHe remembers standing up at the reading group and saying, \u201cThis is the future.\u201d It was, he said, an \u201cunpopular decision at the time.\u201d A former adviser from Australia, with whom he had stayed close, couldn\u2019t quite understand Le\u2019s decision. \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d he asked Le in an email.\u201cI didn\u2019t have a good answer back then,\u201d Le said. \u201cI was just curious. There was a successful paradigm, but to be honest I was just curious about the new paradigm. In 2006, there was very little activity.\u201d He went to join Ng at Stanford and began to pursue Hinton\u2019s ideas. \u201cBy the end of 2010, I was pretty convinced something was going to happen.\u201dWhat happened, soon afterward, was that Le went to Brain as its first intern, where he carried on with his dissertation work \u2014 an extension of which ultimately became the cat paper. On a simple level, Le wanted to see if the computer could be trained to identify on its own the information that was absolutely essential to a given image. He fed the neural network a still he had taken from YouTube. He then told the neural network to throw away some of the information contained in the image, though he didn\u2019t specify what it should or shouldn\u2019t throw away. The machine threw away some of the information, initially at random. Then he said: \u201cJust kidding! Now recreate the initial image you were shown based only on the information you retained.\u201d It was as if he were asking the machine to find a way to \u201csummarize\u201d the image, and then expand back to the original from the summary. If the summary was based on irrelevant data \u2014 like the color of the sky rather than the presence of whiskers \u2014 the machine couldn\u2019t perform a competent reconstruction. Its reaction would be akin to that of a distant ancestor whose takeaway from his brief exposure to saber-tooth tigers was that they made a restful swooshing sound when they moved. Le\u2019s neural network, unlike that ancestor, got to try again, and again and again and again. Each time it mathematically \u201cchose\u201d to prioritize different pieces of information and performed incrementally better. A neural network, however, was a black box. It divined patterns, but the patterns it identified didn\u2019t always make intuitive sense to a human observer. The same network that hit on our concept of cat also became enthusiastic about a pattern that looked like some sort of furniture-animal compound, like a cross between an ottoman and a goat.Le didn\u2019t see himself in those heady cat years as a language guy, but he felt an urge to connect the dots to his early chatbot. After the cat paper, he realized that if you could ask a network to summarize a photo, you could perhaps also ask it to summarize a sentence. This problem preoccupied Le, along with a Brain colleague named Tomas Mikolov, for the next two years.In that time, the Brain team outgrew several offices around him. For a while they were on a floor they shared with executives. They got an email at one point from the administrator asking that they please stop allowing people to sleep on the couch in front of Larry Page and Sergey Brin\u2019s suite. It unsettled incoming V.I.P.s. They were then allocated part of a research building across the street, where their exchanges in the microkitchen wouldn\u2019t be squandered on polite chitchat with the suits. That interim also saw dedicated attempts on the part of Google\u2019s competitors to catch up. (As Le told me about his close collaboration with Tomas Mikolov, he kept repeating Mikolov\u2019s name over and over, in an incantatory way that sounded poignant. Le had never seemed so solemn. I finally couldn\u2019t help myself and began to ask, \u201cIs he ... ?\u201d Le nodded. \u201cAt Facebook,\u201d he replied.)The hundred or so current members of Brain \u2014 it often feels less like a department within a colossal corporate hierarchy than it does a club or a scholastic society or an intergalactic cantina \u2014 came in the intervening years to count among the freest and most widely admired employees in the entire Google organization. They are now quartered in a tiered two-story eggshell building, with large windows tinted a menacing charcoal gray, on the leafy northwestern fringe of the company\u2019s main Mountain View campus. Their microkitchen has a foosball table I never saw used; a Rock Band setup I never saw used; and a Go kit I saw used on a few occasions. (I did once see a young Brain research associate introducing his colleagues to ripe jackfruit, carving up the enormous spiky orb like a turkey.)When I began spending time at Brain\u2019s offices, in June, there were some rows of empty desks, but most of them were labeled with Post-it notes that said things like \u201cJesse, 6/27.\u201d Now those are all occupied. When I first visited, parking was not an issue. The closest spaces were those reserved for expectant mothers or Teslas, but there was ample space in the rest of the lot. By October, if I showed up later than 9:30, I had to find a spot across the street.Brain\u2019s growth made Dean slightly nervous about how the company was going to handle the demand. He wanted to avoid what at Google is known as a \u201csuccess disaster\u201d \u2014 a situation in which the company\u2019s capabilities in theory outpaced its ability to implement a product in practice. At a certain point he did some back-of-the-envelope calculations, which he presented to the executives one day in a two-slide presentation.\u201cIf everyone in the future speaks to their Android phone for three minutes a day,\u201d he told them, \u201cthis is how many machines we\u2019ll need.\u201d They would need to double or triple their global computational footprint.\u201cThat,\u201d he observed with a little theatrical gulp and widened eyes, \u201csounded scary. You\u2019d have to\u201d \u2014 he hesitated to imagine the consequences \u2014 \u201cbuild new buildings.\u201dThere was, however, another option: just design, mass-produce and install in dispersed data centers a new kind of chip to make everything faster. These chips would be called T.P.U.s, or \u201ctensor processing units,\u201d and their value proposition \u2014 counterintuitively \u2014 is that they are deliberately less precise than normal chips. Rather than compute 12.246 times 54.392, they will give you the perfunctory answer to 12 times 54. On a mathematical level, rather than a metaphorical one, a neural network is just a structured series of hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of matrix multiplications carried out in succession, and it\u2019s much more important that these processes be fast than that they be exact. \u201cNormally,\u201d Dean said, \u201cspecial-purpose hardware is a bad idea. It usually works to speed up one thing. But because of the generality of neural networks, you can leverage this special-purpose hardware for a lot of other things.\u201dLe\u2019s paper showed that neural translation was plausible, but he had used only a relatively small public data set. (Small for Google, that is \u2014 it was actually the biggest public data set in the world. A decade of the old Translate had gathered production data that was between a hundred and a thousand times bigger.) More important, Le\u2019s model didn\u2019t work very well for sentences longer than about seven words.Mike Schuster, who then was a staff research scientist at Brain, picked up the baton. He knew that if Google didn\u2019t find a way to scale these theoretical insights up to a production level, someone else would. The project took him the next two years. \u201cYou think,\u201d Schuster says, \u201cto translate something, you just get the data, run the experiments and you\u2019re done, but it doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201dThe issues Schuster had to deal with were tangled. For one thing, Le\u2019s code was custom-written, and it wasn\u2019t compatible with the new open-source machine-learning platform Google was then developing, TensorFlow. Dean directed to Schuster two other engineers, Yonghui Wu and Zhifeng Chen, in the fall of 2015. It took them two months just to replicate Le\u2019s results on the new system. Le was around, but even he couldn\u2019t always make heads or tails of what they had done.As Schuster put it, \u201cSome of the stuff was not done in full consciousness. They didn\u2019t know themselves why they worked.\u201dThis February, Google\u2019s research organization \u2014 the loose division of the company, roughly a thousand employees in all, dedicated to the forward-looking and the unclassifiable \u2014 convened their leads at an offsite retreat at the Westin St. Francis, on Union Square, a luxury hotel slightly less splendid than Google\u2019s own San Francisco shop a mile or so to the east. The morning was reserved for rounds of \u201clightning talks,\u201d quick updates to cover the research waterfront, and the afternoon was idled away in cross-departmental \u201cfacilitated discussions.\u201d The hope was that the retreat might provide an occasion for the unpredictable, oblique, Bell Labs-ish exchanges that kept a mature company prolific.At lunchtime, Corrado and Dean paired up in search of Macduff Hughes, director of Google Translate. Hughes was eating alone, and the two Brain members took positions at either side. As Corrado put it, \u201cWe ambushed him.\u201d\u201cO.K.,\u201d Corrado said to the wary Hughes, holding his breath for effect. \u201cWe have something to tell you.\u201dThey told Hughes that 2016 seemed like a good time to consider an overhaul of Google Translate \u2014 the code of hundreds of engineers over 10 years \u2014 with a neural network. The old system worked the way all machine translation has worked for about 30 years: It sequestered each successive sentence fragment, looked up those words in a large statistically derived vocabulary table, then applied a battery of post-processing rules to affix proper endings and rearrange it all to make sense. The approach is called \u201cphrase-based statistical machine translation,\u201d because by the time the system gets to the next phrase, it doesn\u2019t know what the last one was. This is why Translate\u2019s output sometimes looked like a shaken bag of fridge magnets. Brain\u2019s replacement would, if it came together, read and render entire sentences at one draft. It would capture context \u2014 and something akin to meaning.Most people in Silicon Valley were aware of machine learning as a fast-approaching horizon, so Hughes had seen this ambush coming. He remained skeptical. A modest, sturdily built man of early middle age with mussed auburn hair graying at the temples, Hughes is a classic line engineer, the sort of craftsman who wouldn\u2019t have been out of place at a drafting table at 1970s Boeing. His jeans pockets often look burdened with curious tools of ungainly dimension, as if he were porting around measuring tapes or thermocouples, and unlike many of the younger people who work for him, he has a wardrobe unreliant on company gear. He knew that various people in various places at Google and elsewhere had been trying to make neural translation work \u2014 not in a lab but at production scale \u2014 for years, to little avail.Hughes listened to their case and, at the end, said cautiously that it sounded to him as if maybe they could pull it off in three years.Dean thought otherwise. \u201cWe can do it by the end of the year, if we put our minds to it.\u201d One reason people liked and admired Dean so much was that he had a long record of successfully putting his mind to it. Another was that he wasn\u2019t at all embarrassed to say sincere things like \u201cif we put our minds to it.\u201dHughes was sure the conversion wasn\u2019t going to happen any time soon, but he didn\u2019t personally care to be the reason. \u201cLet\u2019s prepare for 2016,\u201d he went back and told his team. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be the one to say Jeff Dean can\u2019t deliver speed.\u201dA month later, they were finally able to run a side-by-side experiment to compare Schuster\u2019s new system with Hughes\u2019s old one. Schuster wanted to run it for English-French, but Hughes advised him to try something else. \u201cEnglish-French,\u201d he said, \u201cis so good that the improvement won\u2019t be obvious.\u201dIt was a challenge Schuster couldn\u2019t resist. The benchmark metric to evaluate machine translation is called a BLEU score, which compares a machine translation with an average of many reliable human translations. At the time, the best BLEU scores for English-French were in the high 20s. An improvement of one point was considered very good; an improvement of two was considered outstanding.The neural system, on the English-French language pair, showed an improvement over the old system of seven points.Hughes told Schuster\u2019s team they hadn\u2019t had even half as strong an improvement in their own system in the last four years.To be sure this wasn\u2019t some fluke in the metric, they also turned to their pool of human contractors to do a side-by-side comparison. The user-perception scores, in which sample sentences were graded from zero to six, showed an average improvement of 0.4 \u2014 roughly equivalent to the aggregate gains of the old system over its entire lifetime of development.In mid-March, Hughes sent his team an email. All projects on the old system were to be suspended immediately.Until then, the neural-translation team had been only three people \u2014 Schuster, Wu and Chen \u2014 but with Hughes\u2019s support, the broader team began to coalesce. They met under Schuster\u2019s command on Wednesdays at 2 p.m. in a corner room of the Brain building called Quartz Lake. The meeting was generally attended by a rotating cast of more than a dozen people. When Hughes or Corrado were there, they were usually the only native English speakers. The engineers spoke Chinese, Vietnamese, Polish, Russian, Arabic, German and Japanese, though they mostly spoke in their own efficient pidgin and in math. It is not always totally clear, at Google, who is running a meeting, but in Schuster\u2019s case there was no ambiguity.The steps they needed to take, even then, were not wholly clear. \u201cThis story is a lot about uncertainty \u2014 uncertainty throughout the whole process,\u201d Schuster told me at one point. \u201cThe software, the data, the hardware, the people. It was like\u201d \u2014 he extended his long, gracile arms, slightly bent at the elbows, from his narrow shoulders \u2014 \u201cswimming in a big sea of mud, and you can only see this far.\u201d He held out his hand eight inches in front of his chest. \u201cThere\u2019s a goal somewhere, and maybe it\u2019s there.\u201dMost of Google\u2019s conference rooms have videochat monitors, which when idle display extremely high-resolution oversaturated public Google+ photos of a sylvan dreamscape or the northern lights or the Reichstag. Schuster gestured toward one of the panels, which showed a crystalline still of the Washington Monument at night.\u201cThe view from outside is that everyone has binoculars and can see ahead so far.\u201dThe theoretical work to get them to this point had already been painstaking and drawn-out, but the attempt to turn it into a viable product \u2014 the part that academic scientists might dismiss as \u201cmere\u201d engineering \u2014 was no less difficult. For one thing, they needed to make sure that they were training on good data. Google\u2019s billions of words of training \u201creading\u201d were mostly made up of complete sentences of moderate complexity, like the sort of thing you might find in Hemingway. Some of this is in the public domain: The original Rosetta Stone of statistical machine translation was millions of pages of the complete bilingual records of the Canadian Parliament. Much of it, however, was culled from 10 years of collected data, including human translations that were crowdsourced from enthusiastic respondents. The team had in their storehouse about 97 million unique English \u201cwords.\u201d But once they removed the emoticons, and the misspellings, and the redundancies, they had a working vocabulary of only around 160,000.Then you had to refocus on what users actually wanted to translate, which frequently had very little to do with reasonable language as it is employed. Many people, Google had found, don\u2019t look to the service to translate full, complex sentences; they translate weird little shards of language. If you wanted the network to be able to handle the stream of user queries, you had to be sure to orient it in that direction. The network was very sensitive to the data it was trained on. As Hughes put it to me at one point: \u201cThe neural-translation system is learning everything it can. It\u2019s like a toddler. \u2018Oh, Daddy says that word when he\u2019s mad!\u2019\u2009\u201d He laughed. \u201cYou have to be careful.\u201dMore than anything, though, they needed to make sure that the whole thing was fast and reliable enough that their users wouldn\u2019t notice. In February, the translation of a 10-word sentence took 10 seconds. They could never introduce anything that slow. The Translate team began to conduct latency experiments on a small percentage of users, in the form of faked delays, to identify tolerance. They found that a translation that took twice as long, or even five times as long, wouldn\u2019t be registered. An eightfold slowdown would. They didn\u2019t need to make sure this was true across all languages. In the case of a high-traffic language, like French or Chinese, they could countenance virtually no slowdown. For something more obscure, they knew that users wouldn\u2019t be so scared off by a slight delay if they were getting better quality. They just wanted to prevent people from giving up and switching over to some competitor\u2019s service.Schuster, for his part, admitted he just didn\u2019t know if they ever could make it fast enough. He remembers a conversation in the microkitchen during which he turned to Chen and said, \u201cThere must be something we don\u2019t know to make it fast enough, but I don\u2019t know what it could be.\u201dHe did know, though, that they needed more computers \u2014 \u201cG.P.U.s,\u201d graphics processors reconfigured for neural networks \u2014 for training.Hughes went to Schuster to ask what he thought. \u201cShould we ask for a thousand G.P.U.s?\u201dSchuster said, \u201cWhy not 2,000?\u201dTen days later, they had the additional 2,000 processors.By April, the original lineup of three had become more than 30 people \u2014 some of them, like Le, on the Brain side, and many from Translate. In May, Hughes assigned a kind of provisional owner to each language pair, and they all checked their results into a big shared spreadsheet of performance evaluations. At any given time, at least 20 people were running their own independent weeklong experiments and dealing with whatever unexpected problems came up. One day a model, for no apparent reason, started taking all the numbers it came across in a sentence and discarding them. There were months when it was all touch and go. \u201cPeople were almost yelling,\u201d Schuster said.By late spring, the various pieces were coming together. The team introduced something called a \u201cword-piece model,\u201d a \u201ccoverage penalty,\u201d \u201clength normalization.\u201d Each part improved the results, Schuster says, by maybe a few percentage points, but in aggregate they had significant effects. Once the model was standardized, it would be only a single multilingual model that would improve over time, rather than the 150 different models that Translate currently used. Still, the paradox \u2014 that a tool built to further generalize, via learning machines, the process of automation required such an extraordinary amount of concerted human ingenuity and effort \u2014 was not lost on them. So much of what they did was just gut. How many neurons per layer did you use? 1,024 or 512? How many layers? How many sentences did you run through at a time? How long did you train for?\u201cWe did hundreds of experiments,\u201d Schuster told me, \u201cuntil we knew that we could stop the training after one week. You\u2019re always saying: When do we stop? How do I know I\u2019m done? You never know you\u2019re done. The machine-learning mechanism is never perfect. You need to train, and at some point you have to stop. That\u2019s the very painful nature of this whole system. It\u2019s hard for some people. It\u2019s a little bit an art \u2014 where you put your brush to make it nice. It comes from just doing it. Some people are better, some worse.\u201dThe Google team knew that they could have published their results earlier and perhaps beaten their competitors, but as Schuster put it: \u201cLaunching is more important than publishing. People say, \u2018Oh, I did something first,\u2019 but who cares, in the end?\u201dThis did, however, make it imperative that they get their own service out first and better. Hughes had a fantasy that they wouldn\u2019t even inform their users of the switch. They would just wait and see if social media lit up with suspicions about the vast improvements.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s a new system yet,\u201d he told me at 5:36 p.m. two days after Labor Day, one minute before they rolled out Chinese-to-English to 10 percent of their users, without telling anyone. \u201cWe want to make sure it works. The ideal is that it\u2019s exploding on Twitter: \u2018Have you seen how awesome Google Translate got?\u2019\u2009\u201dThe Hawaiian microkitchen has a slightly grainy beach photograph on one wall, a small lei-garlanded thatched-hut service counter with a stuffed parrot at the center and ceiling fixtures fitted to resemble paper lanterns. Two sparse histograms of bamboo poles line the sides, like the posts of an ill-defended tropical fort. Beyond the bamboo poles, glass walls and doors open onto rows of identical gray desks on either side. That morning had seen the arrival of new hooded sweatshirts to honor 10 years of Translate, and many team members went over to the party from their desks in their new gear. They were in part celebrating the fact that their decade of collective work was, as of that day, en route to retirement. At another institution, these new hoodies might thus have become a costume of bereavement, but the engineers and computer scientists from both teams all seemed pleased.Google\u2019s neural translation was at last working. By the time of the party, the company\u2019s Chinese-English test had already processed 18 million queries. One engineer on the Translate team was running around with his phone out, trying to translate entire sentences from Chinese to English using Baidu\u2019s alternative. He crowed with glee to anybody who would listen. \u201cIf you put in more than two characters at once, it times out!\u201d (Baidu says this problem has never been reported by users.)When word began to spread, over the following weeks, that Google had introduced neural translation for Chinese to English, some people speculated that it was because that was the only language pair for which the company had decent results. Everybody at the party knew that the reality of their achievement would be clear in November. By then, however, many of them would be on to other projects.Hughes cleared his throat and stepped in front of the tiki bar. He wore a faded green polo with a rumpled collar, lightly patterned across the midsection with dark bands of drying sweat. There had been last-minute problems, and then last-last-minute problems, including a very big measurement error in the paper and a weird punctuation-related bug in the system. But everything was resolved \u2014 or at least sufficiently resolved for the moment. The guests quieted. Hughes ran efficient and productive meetings, with a low tolerance for maundering or side conversation, but he was given pause by the gravity of the occasion. He acknowledged that he was, perhaps, stretching a metaphor, but it was important to him to underline the fact, he began, that the neural translation project itself represented a \u201ccollaboration between groups that spoke different languages.\u201dTheir neural-translation project, he continued, represented a \u201cstep function forward\u201d \u2014 that is, a discontinuous advance, a vertical leap rather than a smooth curve. The relevant translation had been not just between the two teams but from theory into reality. He raised a plastic demi-flute of expensive-looking Champagne.\u201cTo communication,\u201d he said, \u201cand cooperation!\u201dThe engineers assembled looked around at one another and gave themselves over to little circumspect whoops and applause.Jeff Dean stood near the center of the microkitchen, his hands in his pockets, shoulders hunched slightly inward, with Corrado and Schuster. Dean saw that there was some diffuse preference that he contribute to the observance of the occasion, and he did so in a characteristically understated manner, with a light, rapid, concise addendum.What they had shown, Dean said, was that they could do two major things at once: \u201cDo the research and get it in front of, I dunno, half a billion people.\u201dEveryone laughed, not because it was an exaggeration but because it wasn\u2019t.Perhaps the most famous historic critique of artificial intelligence, or the claims made on its behalf, implicates the question of translation. The Chinese Room argument was proposed in 1980 by the Berkeley philosopher John Searle. In Searle\u2019s thought experiment, a monolingual English speaker sits alone in a cell. An unseen jailer passes him, through a slot in the door, slips of paper marked with Chinese characters. The prisoner has been given a set of tables and rules in English for the composition of replies. He becomes so adept with these instructions that his answers are soon \u201cabsolutely indistinguishable from those of Chinese speakers.\u201d Should the unlucky prisoner be said to \u201cunderstand\u201d Chinese? Searle thought the answer was obviously not. This metaphor for a computer, Searle later wrote, exploded the claim that \u201cthe appropriately programmed digital computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the sense that human beings have minds.\u201dFor the Google Brain team, though, or for nearly everyone else who works in machine learning in Silicon Valley, that view is entirely beside the point. This doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re just ignoring the philosophical question. It means they have a fundamentally different view of the mind. Unlike Searle, they don\u2019t assume that \u201cconsciousness\u201d is some special, numinously glowing mental attribute \u2014 what the philosopher Gilbert Ryle called the \u201cghost in the machine.\u201d They just believe instead that the complex assortment of skills we call \u201cconsciousness\u201d has randomly emerged from the coordinated activity of many different simple mechanisms. The implication is that our facility with what we consider the higher registers of thought are no different in kind from what we\u2019re tempted to perceive as the lower registers. Logical reasoning, on this account, is seen as a lucky adaptation; so is the ability to throw and catch a ball. Artificial intelligence is not about building a mind; it\u2019s about the improvement of tools to solve problems. As Corrado said to me on my very first day at Google, \u201cIt\u2019s not about what a machine \u2018knows\u2019 or \u2018understands\u2019 but what it \u2018does,\u2019 and \u2014 more importantly \u2014 what it doesn\u2019t do yet.\u201dWhere you come down on \u201cknowing\u201d versus \u201cdoing\u201d has real cultural and social implications. At the party, Schuster came over to me to express his frustration with the paper\u2019s media reception. \u201cDid you see the first press?\u201d he asked me. He paraphrased a headline from that morning, blocking it word by word with his hand as he recited it: GOOGLE SAYS A.I. TRANSLATION IS INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM HUMANS\u2019. Over the final weeks of the paper\u2019s composition, the team had struggled with this; Schuster often repeated that the message of the paper was \u201cIt\u2019s much better than it was before, but not as good as humans.\u201d He had hoped it would be clear that their efforts weren\u2019t about replacing people but helping them.And yet the rise of machine learning makes it more difficult for us to carve out a special place for us. If you believe, with Searle, that there is something special about human \u201cinsight,\u201d you can draw a clear line that separates the human from the automated. If you agree with Searle\u2019s antagonists, you can\u2019t. It is understandable why so many people cling fast to the former view. At a 2015 M.I.T. conference about the roots of artificial intelligence, Noam Chomsky was asked what he thought of machine learning. He pooh-poohed the whole enterprise as mere statistical prediction, a glorified weather forecast. Even if neural translation attained perfect functionality, it would reveal nothing profound about the underlying nature of language. It could never tell you if a pronoun took the dative or the accusative case. This kind of prediction makes for a good tool to accomplish our ends, but it doesn\u2019t succeed by the standards of furthering our understanding of why things happen the way they do. A machine can already detect tumors in medical scans better than human radiologists, but the machine can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s causing the cancer.Then again, can the radiologist?Medical diagnosis is one field most immediately, and perhaps unpredictably, threatened by machine learning. Radiologists are extensively trained and extremely well paid, and we think of their skill as one of professional insight \u2014 the highest register of thought. In the past year alone, researchers have shown not only that neural networks can find tumors in medical images much earlier than their human counterparts but also that machines can even make such diagnoses from the texts of pathology reports. What radiologists do turns out to be something much closer to predictive pattern-matching than logical analysis. They\u2019re not telling you what caused the cancer; they\u2019re just telling you it\u2019s there.Once you\u2019ve built a robust pattern-matching apparatus for one purpose, it can be tweaked in the service of others. One Translate engineer took a network he put together to judge artwork and used it to drive an autonomous radio-controlled car. A network built to recognize a cat can be turned around and trained on CT scans \u2014 and on infinitely more examples than even the best doctor could ever review. A neural network built to translate could work through millions of pages of documents of legal discovery in the tiniest fraction of the time it would take the most expensively credentialed lawyer. The kinds of jobs taken by automatons will no longer be just repetitive tasks that were once \u2014 unfairly, it ought to be emphasized \u2014 associated with the supposed lower intelligence of the uneducated classes. We\u2019re not only talking about three and a half million truck drivers who may soon lack careers. We\u2019re talking about inventory managers, economists, financial advisers, real estate agents. What Brain did over nine months is just one example of how quickly a small group at a large company can automate a task nobody ever would have associated with machines.The most important thing happening in Silicon Valley right now is not disruption. Rather, it\u2019s institution-building \u2014 and the consolidation of power \u2014 on a scale and at a pace that are both probably unprecedented in human history. Brain has interns; it has residents; it has \u201cninja\u201d classes to train people in other departments. Everywhere there are bins of free bike helmets, and free green umbrellas for the two days a year it rains, and little fruit salads, and nap pods, and shared treadmill desks, and massage chairs, and random cartons of high-end pastries, and places for baby-clothes donations, and two-story climbing walls with scheduled instructors, and reading groups and policy talks and variegated support networks. The recipients of these major investments in human cultivation \u2014 for they\u2019re far more than perks for proles in some digital salt mine \u2014 have at hand the power of complexly coordinated servers distributed across 13 data centers on four continents, data centers that draw enough electricity to light up large cities.But even enormous institutions like Google will be subject to this wave of automation; once machines can learn from human speech, even the comfortable job of the programmer is threatened. As the party in the tiki bar was winding down, a Translate engineer brought over his laptop to show Hughes something. The screen swirled and pulsed with a vivid, kaleidoscopic animation of brightly colored spheres in long looping orbits that periodically collapsed into nebulae before dispersing once more.Hughes recognized what it was right away, but I had to look closely before I saw all the names \u2014 of people and files. It was an animation of the history of 10 years of changes to the Translate code base, every single buzzing and blooming contribution by every last team member. Hughes reached over gently to skip forward, from 2006 to 2008 to 2015, stopping every once in a while to pause and remember some distant campaign, some ancient triumph or catastrophe that now hurried by to be absorbed elsewhere or to burst on its own. Hughes pointed out how often Jeff Dean\u2019s name expanded here and there in glowing spheres.Hughes called over Corrado, and they stood transfixed. To break the spell of melancholic nostalgia, Corrado, looking a little wounded, looked up and said, \u201cSo when do we get to delete it?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cThe new code base is going to grow. Everything grows.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to a computer used in space travel. A computer was used to guide Apollo missions \u2014 not the \u201cApollo shuttle.\u201d (There was no such shuttle.)Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Shadow of Amazon, European Challenger Looks to China for Inspiration", "Date": "2016-12-16", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 Robert Gentz stepped off an Air Berlin plane in Beijing with the goal of conquering online fashion in China. By the time he boarded his return flight to Berlin, he had a new plan: to copy it.\u201cWe wanted to take that experience back to Europe,\u201d Mr. Gentz said.This holiday season, Zalando, which is Europe\u2019s biggest digital fashion player, is using a made-in-China approach to take on Amazon, just as the American giant is looking to cement its place as the world\u2019s dominant e-commerce company by expanding aggressively into the Continent\u2019s still-fragmented world of digital fashion.In overhauling its successful European online fashion store into a digital platform, Zalando differs from others trying to match Amazon and its logistics and technological prowess.The German company previously focused on handling all sales and inventory itself. But in addition to selling directly to consumers, it now wants to remake itself into a digital shopping mall, allowing fashion houses and retailers to make sales as well, often with limited input from Zalando.These efforts, roughly a year in the making, may foster a rare European tech player able to give Silicon Valley heavy-hitters a run for their money across the region, still one of the world\u2019s largest \u2014 and most profitable \u2014 markets.\u201cIf you want to be the dominant player in a geographical area, you need to go beyond being just a traditional e-commerce player,\u201d said Erik Mitteregger, a board member at Kinnevik, a Swedish investment firm that was an early Zalando investor and still owns a 32 percent stake. \u201cIt\u2019s a necessary move.\u201dZalando\u2019s inspiration from China, though, comes with challenges.Despite domestic dominance, Chinese players like Alibaba have yet to successfully replicate their business model overseas. Online shopping habits in Europe also are somewhat different from those in China. And Amazon and European competitors, including ASOS and Yoox Net-a-Porter, may yet outmuscle Zalando with their traditional takes on e-commerce.For most Americans \u2014 and even some Europeans outside its core German-speaking markets \u2014 Zalando is not a household name.To meet the needs of Europe\u2019s national markets, Zalando has tweaked its offerings. In Germany, where few people use credit cards, consumers can pay with an online service linked to their bank accounts after receiving clothes in the mail. In Italy, it worked with a local delivery company so people wary of goods not arriving could pay in cash upon receipt of their orders.\u201cZalando is well placed to be a leading fashion platform in Europe,\u201d said Andrea Ferraz, a Morgan Stanley analyst in London.Still, the company remains a relative minnow \u2014 its $9.5 billion valuation is one-fortieth that of Amazon. And Europe\u2019s fast-growing online fashion market, estimated to be worth $75 billion, has not gone unnoticed by e-commerce giants.To compete with Amazon and others, Zalando has spent heavily on a network of logistics hubs that dot the European landscape.On the outskirts of Erfurt, a sleepy German town, orange boxes filled with designer dresses and shoes scuttled along miles of conveyor belts, while workers on push-scooters sped through Zalando\u2019s first custom-built logistics warehouse, now the size of 18 football fields. Four more \u2014 from Italy to Germany \u2014 are up and running, and new sites are planned outside Paris and, potentially, near London.As part of its overhaul, Mr. Gentz gathered his management team soon after Zalando\u2019s I.P.O. in 2014, outlining the steps needed to become a digital hub for all things fashion.For one, it is combining its logistical expertise with that of big brands and mom and pop stores all over Europe. The goal, executives say, is to use Zalando\u2019s website and smartphone application as a platform to sell goods either from its warehouses or directly from fashion houses themselves, giving customers greater choice and flexibility.\u201cNo one else offers this level of partnership,\u201d said Roland Auschel, Adidas\u2019s head of global sales, who first discussed stronger ties with Zalando during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.The e-commerce company has also offered up its in-house advertising team. That includes testing an online marketplace where Zalando connects fashion houses with \u201conline influencers,\u201d or personalities with large social media followings.For Nicolas Borg, a Zalando strategy executive who previously worked at eBay, the next stage will most likely be chatbots, or humanlike interactions powered by artificial intelligence, to offer fashion advice to consumers on the likes of Facebook Messenger.\u201cIn the future, what will matter is not where the purchase happens, but how you can influence it,\u201d Mr. Borg said.\u201cThat is our biggest challenge,\u201d he added. \u201cHow do we change the online experience?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Big Banks Are Putting Rain Forests in Peril", "Date": "2016-12-03", "News": "Global lenders, sometimes flouting their own policies, have financed projects in Indonesia and elsewhere that destroy ecosystems and contribute to climate change.Supported byIn early 2015, scientists monitoring satellite images at Global Forest Watch raised the alarm about the destruction of rain forests in Indonesia.Environmental groups raced to the scene in West Kalimantan province, on the island of Borneo, to find a charred wasteland: smoldering fires, orangutans driven from their nests, and signs of an extensive release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\u201cThere was pretty much no forest left,\u201d said Karmele Llano S\u00e1nchez, director of the nonprofit International Animal Rescue\u2019s orangutan rescue group, which set out to save the endangered primates. \u201cAll the forest had burned.\u201dThe year before the clearing of trees in West Kalimantan, Rajawali\u2019s plantation arm secured $235 million in loans \u2014 funds that the Indonesian company used to buy out a partner and bolster its landholdings \u2014 from banks including Credit Suisse and Bank of America, according to an examination of lending data by The New York Times.That figure is almost certainly incomplete because not all financing is made public. It also excludes loans made by the same banks to forestry projects outside Southeast Asia, or financing provided to other, more global players. And it contrasts with efforts by companies like Nestl\u00e9 and Procter & Gamble to distance themselves from suppliers linked to deforestation.\u201cDestroying the world\u2019s forests makes fighting climate change almost impossible,\u201d said Andrew W. Mitchell, executive director of the Global Canopy Programme, a forestry think tank. \u201cThe finance sector is really lagging behind in realizing that.\u201dThe 2014 deal financed Rajawali\u2019s expansion into palm oil by helping the conglomerate buy out a former partner, invest in new palm oil mills and increase its landholdings. Demand for palm oil is surging worldwide, driven by rising incomes in markets like China and India and a switch away from trans fats by Americans and Europeans.Rajawali\u2019s plantations have been accused by environmental and labor groups of deforestation and illegal burning. Indonesia is one of the world\u2019s biggest palm oil producers, and forestry loss there and elsewhere ranks as one of the biggest single contributors to global warming.Sebastian Sharp, a spokesman for Rajawali\u2019s plantation arm, acknowledged that the burning and clearing on its West Kalimantan forest sites might be illegal but said local communities encroaching on its properties and starting the fires were to blame. He said the company did not engage in illegal burning or clearing.Credit Suisse declined to comment on its Rajawali deal or to say whether the deal violated its sustainability policies. A Bank of America spokesman, Bill Halldin, said that the most serious accusations against Rajawali came after the 2014 loan, in which the bank played \u201ca very small role.\u201d\u201cToday, we would certainly consider more information before making any decision on any client,\u201d he said.Brigitte Seegers, a spokeswoman for ABN Amro, declined to comment.Climate concerns have been brought into sharp relief by the impending presidency of Donald J. Trump, who has called climate change a hoax. Mr. Trump has said he will pull the United States out of the Paris accord, a commitment by 195 countries to take concrete measures to reduce planet-warming carbon emissions.Rajawali originally operated its palm plantation business, Green Eagle Holdings, as a joint venture with the French conglomerate Louis Dreyfus. But starting in 2014, Rajawali took the first step to consolidate the palm oil business under its control, and invest in new infrastructure.Its loans from Western banks were crucial. In January 2014, Green Eagle attracted a $120 million loan from a group of lenders led by ABN Amro. In July of that year, it scored an even bigger loan of $235 million from a syndicate led by Credit Suisse. Bank of America also took part in that loan.The banks issued those loans as Rajawali was being accused of extensive forest and peatland destruction, illegal burning, use of child labor and the use of force against workers at plantations under its control.Land-cover mapping by the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry, and satellite imagery from Global Forest Watch, show forest loss at two sites in West Kalimantan from 2011 to 2013 and again in 2015, with much of the forest gone by the end of the year. Those sites included around 11,000 hectares of peat, which, when set alight, can smolder for months underground.Zamzami, who goes by one name, a Greenpeace staff member in Indonesia who visited a Rajawali plantation in West Kalimantan in September 2015, said the burning continued. \u201cIt was difficult to breathe because of the smoke,\u201d he said in field notes. \u201cFar away, on the horizon, I could see the forest wall.\u201dEagle High is now one of Indonesia\u2019s largest palm oil plantation operators, with more than a million acres in land rights under its control, according to an investors\u2019 presentation dated September 2014.In December 2015, a 22-year-old worker was shot dead at the plantation by state security forces. It was unclear why state forces were on private property.Mr. Sharp, the Eagle High spokesman, blamed local villagers for the forest clearing and burning on its sites. \u201cIt\u2019s being done by local communities, and we have no control over that,\u201d he said. Environmental groups argue that plantation companies are responsible for protecting their sites.Mr. Sharp said that there were instances in which workers brought their children to plantations but that the company was \u201ctrying to brainstorm ways in which we can stop them from doing that.\u201dHe also questioned the wisdom of Indonesian labor law. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we hire children at 15? Families need income,\u201d he said. Under the country\u2019s law, the minimum age for hazardous work, including jobs on plantations, is 18.The worker who was killed, Marvel Doga, was \u201cdrunk and violent, poured petrol everywhere and threatened to set fire, and he had with him a bow and arrow\u201d when nearby state security forces tried to incapacitate him, leading to his death, Mr. Sharp said. He said Eagle High paid \u201cthousands of dollars\u201d to his family in compensation.Credit Suisse and ABN Amro declined to discuss specific deals. Bank of America declined to comment on the accusations.But in a February 2015 research note, Credit Suisse deemed Rajawali\u2019s palm oil push a success. Eagle High\u2019s increased landholdings and land rights signaled \u201csignificant headroom for expansion\u201d of palm oil production, Priscilla Tjitra, an equity analyst for the bank, said in a report to clients.\u201cThe allocation of finance is so influential in our economy and to our environment,\u201d said Tom Picken of the Rainforest Action Network. \u201cBut there\u2019s little way we can hold financial sectors to account.\u201dInternational Animal Rescue, which runs a temporary shelter for about 100 orangutans in West Kalimantan, said its staff had rescued roughly 50 of the primates during the 2015 burning season, twice the number the organization rescues in an average year.\u201cThey were all starving, all skinny,\u201d said Ms. S\u00e1nchez, the orangutan rescue group\u2019s director. So far this year, about 25 orangutans have been rehabilitated.\u201cThe problem is that every time an area is destroyed and orangutans are under real threat, we have to look for areas to release them, and that\u2019s challenging,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re running out of places where we can release these orangutans.\u201dIn September, Rajawali\u2019s plantation arm secured a $192 million loan from Bank Negara Indonesia, a state bank, to refinance the debt held by its plantation subsidiaries and to double the capacity of palm oil refineries in Papua and West Kalimantan.Bank Negara Indonesia\u2019s sustainability policies say that its clients must adopt \u201cminimum environmental, social and governance standards.\u201d The bank did not respond to requests for comment.An article last Sunday about some financing by global lenders for projects that contribute to climate change misstated the number of countries involved in the Paris accord on planet-warming carbon emissions. It is 195, not 95.Advertisement"}

They responded in a way that struck me as even more curious, acting as if I\u2019d asked them for their credit cards.There are a lot of holiday movies, and there are a lot more Christmas-themed holiday movies than Hanukkah-themed holiday movies (\u201cEight Crazy Nights,\u201d 2002, an animated \u201ctribute\u201d to Hanukkah that stars Adam Sandler, can be bought starting at $2.99 from iTunes, Amazon, YouTube, Vudu and Google Play, incidentally), and most holiday movies aren\u2019t very good. There aren\u2019t many as bad as \u201cZombie Lake,\u201d but as we\u2019ve already established \u2026 well, you know. Holiday Classic almost never equals Actual Classic. So here I\u2019d like to recommend a few holiday movies that are at least interesting.Netflix offers a bounty of the conventionally beloved (which also means widely disparaged) holiday pictures on its streaming service. Yes, there\u2019s \u201cLove Actually\u201d (2003); the increasingly well-liked \u201cScrooged\u201d (1988) (Bill Murray\u2019s latter-day sainthood has done a lot for this picture, which was greeted with tepid reviews on its theatrical release nearly 30 years ago); and the 1954 perennial \u201cWhite Christmas.\u201d Starring Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Vera-Ellen and Rosemary Clooney (in a relatively rare film role), this chestnut remains a very relaxed and genteel viewing experience, and has lots of pleasant Irving Berlin tunes. It can be an exceptional holiday decompressant.There\u2019s also a very unusual picture on Filmstruck: Joseph L. Mankiewicz\u2019s \u201cA Carol for Another Christmas\u201d (1964), a made-for-TV oddity. It has a nonsensically star-studded cast: Sterling Hayden is lectured by both Ben Gazzara and Steve Lawrence. Britt Ekland has a blink-and-you-miss-it silent cameo. This was actually one of four TV movies commissioned by the United Nations to foster the notion of world peace. Rod Serling\u2019s script recasts Dickens\u2019s \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d to teach its own Scrooge (here named \u201cGrudge\u201d and played by Hayden) to stop worrying and love international cooperation. It plays pretty much exactly as you\u2019d expect a Rod Serling version of \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d to play. It\u2019s spectacularly dated (although Peter Sellers\u2019s work as a future demagogue has a certain timeless quality), but if you want to boggle your movie-buff kin, this will do the trick.Advertisement"}

You would think.But the president-elect wanted more. Romney was a \u201cchoker,\u201d in Donald Trump\u2019s earlier put-down; that, and he walked \u201clike a penguin.\u201d If Romney could take his flightless bird-in-a-tuxedo-act outside and apologize for calling Trump a fraud, then maybe the job was his. Romney would waddle no further. Apologize? Cripes, the title of his book is \u201cNo Apology.\u201dStill, high-five! For Trump, the debasement of Romney was just another hit of dopamine \u2014 the neurotransmitter once called the Kim Kardashian of molecules. He needs a jolt several times a day. But in turn, he gives it back to you, the millions in his personality cult, and certainly the click-bait web and cable press, who need it just as much.Earlier this month, Representative Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington, took to the floor of the House to plead for one thing from the incoming leader of the free world: \u201cStop tweeting, Mr. President-elect.\u201d Not a chance. His tiny fingers can launch 140 predawn characters from the fortress of his gilded tower and mighty Boeing will lose more than a billion dollars in stock value a few hours later.At the other end, his 17.3 million followers wake up every day eager for a shot of unfiltered Trump. It\u2019s a dangerous codependency. \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d? \u201cUnwatchable!\u201d Vanity Fair, after a scathing review of a Trump restaurant? \u201cDead!\u201d The slaughter of civilians in the ancient city of Aleppo? Nothing. The real-world consequences of weaponized hatred are no concern for a man with a shameful incuriosity and a profound lack of empathy.But look again at the Trump Tower stage \u2014 it\u2019s Kanye! Who cares about Aleppo, or a foreign adversary deliberately trying to undermine an American election, when you\u2019ve got a troubled rapper stopping by for his hit of Trump. The Orange One recognizes him \u2014 on CNN, now cutting away from Syria.And so we see the clear design that Trump will use to rule: He will give us showmanship and cheap drama, put-downs and promises \u2014 the stagecraft of the world\u2019s most powerful narcissist. And meanwhile, the nation will be governed by oil oligarchs, climate change deniers and Goldman Sachs tycoons brought in to do the real work.The Koch brothers didn\u2019t support Trump. But they got their dream team of hold-back-the-clock fossil fools and corporate sycophants. The bullet-headed nominee for labor secretary, Andrew Puzder, is against expanding the minimum wage for all the poor souls who voted for Trump. The Energy Department nominee, Rick Perry, vowed to eliminate that very agency. And he sits on the board of the pipeline company that wants to carry oil directly under a tribal water supply in North Dakota.Pay no attention \u2014 it\u2019s back on the road with the thank you tour. This traveling gloat-fest is an excuse for more of the Trump narcotic. He is having trouble getting A-list musicians to perform at his inauguration. The sound of an angry mob is music enough. The rallies are a contact high for both sides and \u2014 as in Wisconsin the other day \u2014 a chance for one more chant of \u201cLock her up!\u201dBut locking Hillary Clinton up for careless management of her email could be problematic when it seems that Trump\u2019s future national security adviser, the fake news enthusiast Michael Flynn, was himself investigated for wrongly sharing classified information with foreign leaders.Time for another tweet, a put-down of a union man who dared to question how Trump played Indiana workers for suckers in his big factory stroll. Trump helped to save, at most, a thousand jobs. If President Obama had held a big press tour for all the 15 million new jobs created on his watch, he could boast of 36,000 jobs, once a week, throughout his eight years in office.It\u2019s boring stuff, anyway. Just like that daily intelligence briefing, which Trump says he doesn\u2019t need because \u201cI\u2019m, like, a smart person.\u201d But more to the point: for Trump, there\u2019s no thrill in basic information. He\u2019ll certainly feel something if there\u2019s a catastrophic terrorist attack and, as with George W. Bush, there was an intelligence community warning of a looming threat.Back to Trump Tower \u2014 oh look, all the tech titans! They didn\u2019t back him, these captains of Apple and Facebook, Tesla and Amazon. And, given his record of boasting on tape of being a sexual predator, Trump couldn\u2019t get hired as deputy office boy at any one of those companies. But as with the Romney grovel, he gets another hit by bringing them to heel. For another day, at least, it\u2019s all a president-elect needs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mother Nature Is Brought to You By ...", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byThis year, parks in several states including Idaho and Washington, and the National Park Service, will be blazing a new trail, figuratively at least, as they begin offering opportunities to advertisers within their borders.King County already partnered with Chipotle to hide 30 giant replica burritos on parkland bearing the logo of the agency and the restaurant chain. People who found the burritos won prizes from Chipotle.The logic behind these efforts is, in its own way, unimpeachable. Many millions of people \u2014 that is, \u201cgreen consumers\u201d \u2014 visit parks every day, representing an unrealized marketing opportunity of great value. Yes, parks are meant to be natural, not commercial, but times are tough, or so say the backers of the new schemes.The spread of advertising to natural settings is just a taste of what\u2019s coming. Over the next decade, prepare for a new wave of efforts to reach some of the last remaining bastions of peace, quiet and individual focus \u2014 like schools, libraries, churches and even our homes.Some of this reflects technological change, but the real reason is the business model of what I call the \u201cattention merchants.\u201d Unlike ordinary businesses, which sell a product, attention merchants sell people to advertisers. They do so either by finding captive audiences (like at a park or school) or by giving stuff away to gather up consumer data for resale.Once upon a time, this was a business model largely restricted to television and newspapers, where it remained within certain limits. Over the last decade, though, it has spread to nearly every new technology, and started penetrating spaces long thought inviolate.Nor are our workplaces and social spheres immune. The time and energy we spend socializing with friends and family has, almost incredibly, been harnessed for marketing, through the business models of Facebook, Instagram and other social media. At the office, the most successful of the productivity-killing distraction engines, BuzzFeed, brags of luring a \u201cbored at work\u201d network hundreds of millions strong.Unfortunately, there is worse yet to come: The nation\u2019s most talented engineers now apply themselves to making marketing platforms out of innovations \u2014 A.I. assistants like the Amazon Echo or self-driving cars. Here the intrusions will be subtle, even disguised, so as not to trip our defenses, but they will be even more powerful, going after our very decision-making processes. Consider how much we already depend on Siri or Google Maps: What happens when our most trusted tools have mixed motives?Advertising revenue often seems like \u201cfree money,\u201d but there are enormous risks for the character of any institution once it begins to rely heavily on advertising income. History and logic suggest that, once advertisers become a major funding source, they create their own priorities, and unless carefully controlled they will warp the underlying space to serve their interests.This development raises questions beyond the mere issue of how annoying ads can be. The model of individual liberty and a self-reliant citizenry was proposed by the founders and influenced by philosophers like John Stuart Mill, who envisioned sufficient time and space for self-development of character and room for making decisions that are truly ours.Similar ideas about the prerequisite of free will are to be found in the great spiritual traditions, which sanctify certain times and spaces for the sake of our spiritual development.These ideals are threatened by a way of doing business that by its nature seeks to invade the most sanctified of spaces.If you don\u2019t like the sound of this future, resistance is not futile \u2014 it is necessary. A commercial dystopia can be averted only by private resistance and principled decisions by the leaders of institutions.The first simply requires redrawing the lines that have been eroded. Where once upon a time, tradition or religion drew those lines for us, blocking out times for family and faith, nowadays personal or family initiative are required to define parts of our lives as off limits. The default setting will always be intrusion and distraction. We need to flip the switch.The second should be to reduce the attention economy by patronizing businesses or institutions with subscription models or those that keep advertising within reasonable limits.Third, the leaders of schools, libraries and even the more principled technology firms should understand that there is always a hidden cost to the proposition offered by advertising. Once an institution is dependent on ad revenue, it\u2019s impossible to put the Crest 3D White Radiant Mint toothpaste back in the tube.Above all, we should not simply resign ourselves to a world saturated by commercial appeals at the cost of our private and sacred spaces. As the great legal scholar Charles Black Jr. once put it, \u201cI tremble for the sanity of a society that talks, on the level of abstract principle, of the precious integrity of the individual mind, and all the while, on the level of concrete fact, forces the individual mind to spend a good part of every day under bombardment with whatever some crowd of promoters want to throw at it.\u201dTim Wu is the author of \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Struggle to Get Inside Our Heads.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "My Father, the Shapeshifter", "Date": "2016-12-31", "News": "In a book about her enigmatic father, Susan Faludi explores the very meaning of gender and identity.Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 On a warm September evening in the Hollywood Hills, guests at a book party for the writer Susan Faludi sipped prosecco and munched on lotus root chips in the courtyard of the Spanish-style home of the journalist Steve Oney and his wife, the interior designer Madeline Stuart. Book people mixed with movie people: Under a dense black acacia tree, the writer Amy Wilentz chatted with the television producer Nicole Yorkin; the historian Ed Larson rubbed elbows with the film producer Sean Daniel at the bar.\u201cIn the summer of 2004, I received an email from my father with the subject line \u2018Changes,\u2019\u201d she began, her soft voice occasionally drowned out by cars racing up the canyon. \u201cMy father lived in Hungary, and it was the first communication I\u2019d received from him in many years. He said he had some interesting news for me. He had decided, at the age of 76, that he\u2019d had enough of, quote, impersonating a macho, aggressive man. There was a series of snapshots attached to the message. The first one showed my father standing in a hospital lobby in a sleeveless blouse and red skirt. Beside him were, as he wrote in the note, \u2018the other post-op girls\u2019 \u2014 two patients who were also making \u2018the change.\u2019\u201d\u201cIn the Darkroom\u201d is a departure for Ms. Faludi. While previous works like \u201cBacklash: The Undeclared War Against American Women\u201d and \u201cStiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man\u201d were essentially polemics, her memoir is deeply personal. It is also a project as high concept as a sitcom pitch: What if a famous feminist author \u2014 whose activism was spurred by her father\u2019s bullying machismo \u2014 discovered that said phallocrat had become a woman? Complications ensue. But Ms. Faludi mines her material less for easy ironies than for insights into the very meaning of identity.Even so, the liveliest exchange in the Q. and A. session, after Ms. Faludi read an excerpt about visiting the building in Budapest where her father, a Holocaust survivor, escaped being shot by the Nazis, centered on the less weighty issue of the author\u2019s use of pronouns in the book \u2014 \u201che\u201d for every reference to her father before his surgery, \u201cshe\u201d for every one after. Acknowledging her methodology as \u201ca copy editor\u2019s nightmare,\u201d Ms. Faludi said she flubbed it only once.\u201cThey\u2019re kinder when you write a personal book,\u201d Ms. Faludi observed a few weeks after the party in Los Angeles. After several more promotional stops, she was back at her home in Brunswick, Me., where she is a research associate at Bowdoin College. (Her husband, the writer Russ Rymer, teaches in the English department.) On the kind of fall afternoon at which New England colleges excel, scarlet and amber leaves wafted from the oaks surrounding the house \u2014 a two-story traditional furnished largely with books and Mission-style pieces. (Having spent 20 years in California, Ms. Faludi considers Los Angeles her \u201cpsychic home.\u201d)(\u201cSusan is an observer,\u201d said her friend Peggy Orenstein, the author of \u201cGirls and Sex: Navigating the Complicated New Landscape.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s not what you would call an oversharer. But when she does talk about herself, she can be very funny in a wry, understated way.\u201d)In one of the stranger twists in a book full of them, Steven Faludi \u2014 a tough, even violent presence during Ms. Faludi\u2019s childhood in Yorktown Heights, N.Y. \u2014 embraced the hoariest stereotypes of femininity when he became Stef\u00e1nie Faludi. \u201cHere\u2019s my father, whose raw aggressions inspired my feminism,\u201d Ms. Faludi said, picking at her edamame. \u201cAnd the first time I visit him in Hungary, he\u2019s giving me the grand tour of his Marilyn Monroe outfits and cases of makeup.\u201dStef\u00e1nie Faludi was nothing if not self-involved. During a later visit, she made Ms. Faludi watch a video of her sex-reassignment surgery. And the book was her idea. But Ms. Faludi\u2019s father was also a \u201cmasker and dodger.\u201d Over the course of many trips to Hungary, Ms. Faludi recalled, \u201cwe had this constant contest between my father\u2019s desire to put forth a story that erased everything that came before the present and my avid interest in excavating my father\u2019s past.\u201dIn fact, she unearthed a series of pasts, each concealing another like a matryoshka doll. Her father, who died in May 2015 at 87, started life as Istvan Friedman, an only child born to an assimilated, well-to-do Jewish couple in Budapest. He lived a privileged existence in a regally appointed apartment in the city and a summer villa in the Buda Hills, but was largely neglected by his parents. His mother beat him after catching him trying on her undergarments, and he struggled to fit in at a school famous for its athletic teams. Istvan\u2019s early shapeshifting skills ultimately saved his life: During the Nazi occupation of Hungary \u2014 when two-thirds of the country\u2019s Jewish population was exterminated \u2014 he survived by passing as a gentile and rescued his parents from deportation by impersonating a fascist Arrow Cross officer.Then there was Istvan Faludi, the \u201cnormalized\u201d identity Ms. Faludi\u2019s father assumed after the war. At 20, Mr. Faludi fled to Brazil, where he found work as a photographer and filmmaker for the Brazilian government. At the end of 1953, he emigrated to the United States, marrying Ms. Faludi\u2019s mother, Marilyn Lanning, a homemaker and journalist, three years later. Enter Steven Faludi \u2014 professional film retoucher, rugged outdoorsman, \u201cUr-suburban dad.\u201d\u201cHe was always trying on different personae,\u201d Ms. Faludi recalled. \u201cMost of them at the time were frenetic sportsman identities \u2014 rock climber, ice climber, extreme cyclist.\u201dWalled-off and despotic, Mr. Faludi could also be abusive. Ms. Faludi\u2019s parents separated when she was 16; one night the next year, her father violated a restraining order and returned to their home to attack the boyfriend of Ms. Faludi\u2019s mother with a baseball bat and a knife. For the next two and a half decades, Ms. Faludi had little contact with him.(As unsparing as she is with her father\u2019s personal history, Ms. Faludi is more guarded about her own. If he was dogged by disappointment, she was a classic overachiever: After putting herself through Harvard, she wrote for publications like The Miami Herald and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, and won a Pulitzer Prize in 1991 for her expos\u00e9 in The Wall Street Journal on the leveraged buyout of Safeway Stores. The same year, she published \u201cBacklash,\u201d a best seller and a National Book Critics Circle Award winner.)In 1990, Mr. Faludi moved back to Hungary. \u201cIt was the beginning of the capitalist revolution, and I think my father had the idea he was going to be this kind of globe-trotting entrepreneur,\u201d Ms. Faludi said. \u201cWhen that didn\u2019t work out, it was sort of the last unveiling of his attempts to be a masculine man.\u201d He flew to Thailand to have sex-reassignment surgery in 2004. Having failed to get a letter of recommendation for the procedure, he forged one.The elusiveness of identity is Ms. Faludi\u2019s id\u00e9e fixe. She is suspicious of efforts by her father or anyone else to reduce gender \u2014 not to mention sexual, racial or national identity \u2014 to an either/or proposition. \u201cAll the years she was alive,\u201d she writes of her father, \u201cshe\u2019d sought to settle the question of who she was. Jew or Christian? Hungarian or American? Woman or man? So many oppositions.\u201dA reporter read Ms. Faludi this passage, which continues: \u201cThere is in the universe only one true divide, one real binary \u2014\u2014\u201d At this point, an oak nut fell, banging loudly off the patio table. \u201cWhether or not you get hit on the head by an acorn,\u201d Ms. Faludi deadpanned. \u201cLife and death,\u201d the lines conclude. \u201cEither you are living or you are not. Everything else is molten, malleable.\u201dMs. Faludi has mixed feelings about the media spotlight that the transgender movement has, at least until recently, enjoyed in this country. She applauds trans activists for adopting the idea that \u201cgender is fluid and on a spectrum.\u201d And she binge-watched \u201cTransparent,\u201d commending the Amazon series for referring to the work of the pioneering sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld as well as for examining the connective tissue between Jewish identity and gender. On the other hand, she is skeptical of what she calls the \u201ctropes of victimization, heroism and celebrity\u201d personified by Caitlyn Jenner posing in a satin corset on the cover of Vanity Fair.The way Ms. Faludi\u2019s father wanted to see herself could be comically fanciful; at one point, she self-identifies as \u201can overdressed shiksa.\u201d But for all the walls she erected between her various incarnations, she ultimately comes to a reckoning, of sorts, with her past. Ms. Faludi describes a visit to a small Holocaust exhibit at the Hungarian National Museum that brings her father to tears, as well as a trip to a reform synagogue where her father says a Kaddish for the parents she rejected after saving their lives.Toward the end of her life, she questions whether her daughter is \u201cdoing what Avedon did\u201d \u2014 creating an unforgiving parental portrait. But when Ms. Faludi offers to let her read the book manuscript, she declines. In the end, Ms. Faludi writes, she \u201cwanted to be seen and seen whole.\u201dAt her reading in Los Angeles, Ms. Faludi made it clear that hers was not a story that ended in \u201chealing and closure.\u201d But the light she shines on her father\u2019s identity illuminates facets of her own. \u201cI realized that so much of what I am is not self-generated,\u201d she said, \u201cthat I am also, like my father, a product of external connections\u201d \u2014 to her father, for one, as well as to his extended family in Eastern Europe.\u201cSusan\u2019s relationship with her father was something she had put up a firewall against, and I think tearing that down was wrenching,\u201d said Mr. Rymer, who joined Ms. Faludi on a number of her trips to Hungary. \u201cBut over the course of the book, I think her understanding of a lot of aspects of herself deepened.\u201dNot that there were any lightning bolts.\u201cIt made me think of how impossible it is to tease apart all these different tangled threads that go into the making of an \u2018identity,\u2019\u201d Ms. Faludi wrote in her email. \u201cHow much is what we\u2019re born with, how much is imposed on us, and how much is determined by our own actions? Which I guess brings me back to the original question of the book: Is identity what we choose to be, or is it the very thing we can\u2019t escape?\u201dIt is worth noting that Mr. Rauschenberg specified that the panels of \u201cAutobiography\u201d could be installed horizontally \u2014 reading forward \u2014 or vertically, as they were hung at Bowdoin \u2014 reading down.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lawmakers Change Their Tone on AT&T and Time Warner Deal", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byAt a hearing on Capitol Hill on Wednesday that was being closely watched for how mega-mergers will be viewed in the coming Trump administration, members of a Senate Judiciary subcommittee that oversees regulatory agencies that decide on mergers said the deal merited tough scrutiny. The chief executives of AT&T and Time Warner were grilled at the hearing about a range of issues related to the deal.But in a change from previous comments, lawmakers also questioned whether traditional ways of evaluating mergers are growing outdated as Silicon Valley companies like Facebook and Google become massive media platforms that threaten the television industry. Their tone was more circumspect than those that immediately followed the deal\u2019s announcement, when lawmakers had been more critical.\u201cWe want to ensure that competition thrives in this critical market and we don\u2019t stifle innovation or deter the emergence of cutting-edge technologies that customers demand,\u201d said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who heads the full Judiciary Committee. Mr. Grassley said Google, Facebook, Amazon and Netflix have transformed the video landscape.Senator David Perdue, Republican of Georgia, said the deal would combine companies that did not directly compete against one another. \u201cThe consumer is benefited from the aggregation,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is called capitalism.\u201dOver all, senators were asking \u201chard questions,\u201d said Larry Downes, a professor at Georgetown\u2019s McDonough School of Business. But, he added, \u201cthey seem to be open-minded about the changing nature of competition in the information sector.\u201dAT&T, a telecom giant, and Time Warner, which owns CNN and HBO, had said in October that AT&T would buy Time Warner to create a mobile video powerhouse. The hearing may have implications beyond this deal, with the comments potentially encouraging more acquisitions by companies that have been waiting out the Obama administration, which has rejected several mergers.\u201cThe D.O.J. pays particularly close attention to Senate and House antitrust subcommittees because they oversee the D.O.J.,\u201d said Paul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen and Company, who added that the committee\u2019s commentary \u201cbears watching for its potential effect on the D.O.J.\u201d Members of the Justice Department attended the hearing.When the deal was announced, days before the presidential election, leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee issued strong cautionary statements about it. Donald J. Trump, on the campaign trail at the time, said he would block the merger if elected. He has singled out CNN, the cable news network owned by Time Warner, with particular rancor for its election coverage.As president, Mr. Trump will have no direct power over mergers, but he will greatly influence which ones are approved, depending on whom he picks to be the assistant attorney general for antitrust or the chairman of the F.C.C. AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, told CNBC before the hearing that he had not had contact with the Trump transition team.During the hearing, the companies pitched a message that catered to the new administration: a populist promise of lower prices and the potential to build more wireless infrastructure through the merger. While AT&T and Time Warner are powerhouses, they presented themselves as weaker rivals to the cable industry and Silicon Valley tech companies.Mr. Stephenson said in prepared remarks that cable companies dominated the broadband and television market, serving high-speed internet to eight of every 10 American homes that have broadband service. To experiment with new mobile video technologies, he said, AT&T needed to have in-house content to quickly try new streaming services at a lower cost. He added that AT&T had just introduced a streaming service with 100 channels for less than most cable television packages.\u201cIt is only the beginning of what we want to bring to the marketplace to threaten cable\u2019s entrenched and still-dominant market position,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said. He said AT&T would give CNN editorial independence if the merger were approved.Jeff Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, said, \u201cIt is not enough to deliver great content.\u201d The companies\u2019 competitors have multiplied, he said.No lawmakers at the hearing said the merger should be blocked, but several expressed skepticism.\u201cI have serious concerns about this transaction,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. The deal \u201cpotentially has serious negative impacts on competition and on consumers.\u201dMark Cuban, an internet entrepreneur and owner of the NBA\u2019s Dallas Mavericks, who also spoke at the hearing, said the truly dominant companies in media distribution these days were Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon. \u201cFacebook is without question in a dominant position, if not the dominant position, for content delivery,\u201d he said.Consumer groups rejected the characterization of AT&T and Time Warner as disadvantaged rivals, saying a combined company would create a powerhouse that all cable providers and networks would have to negotiate with. Streaming providers like Sling TV and Hulu would face a major new competitor, with AT&T\u2019s access to 110 million wireless and satellite subscribers and premium television networks under the same roof, the groups said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Nearly in Ruins: The Church Where Sages Dreamed of a Modern Brazil", "Date": "2016-12-25", "News": "Supported byRio de Janeiro JournalRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Neighbors from surrounding apartment buildings toss empty beer bottles through a gaping hole in the roof of the once-majestic church. Pigeons roam the cavernous nave, their excrement piling up on the floor. A watchman guards treasures from the thieves who prey on the city\u2019s derelict buildings.The neoclassical Positivist Church of Brazil, with its soaring columns and a cryptic sign above its entrance proclaiming, \u201cThe Living Are Forever and Increasingly Governed by the Dead,\u201d was long a captivating sight on Benjamin Constant Street near the old city center.These days, the crumbling, graffiti-tagged church, whose freethinking founders helped modern Brazil rise from the ashes of an empire, is just another emblem of how Rio de Janeiro neglects its past, allowing grandeur to fall into ruin.\u201cCongregants once gathered here to debate incendiary ideas originating in Paris, the holy city for the positivists,\u201d said Christiane Souza, 48, the church\u2019s heritage director. \u201cTragically, our institution now finds itself in a state of neglect, as if history is something Brazil should disdain.\u201dRoughly defined, Comte\u2019s philosophy of positivism sought to reorganize society around the concept that explanations derived from science should be prized as a way of understanding the world. Positivism drew admirers in places including Mexico, Britain and Turkey. Taking things a step further, Comte created his own religion to spread his beliefs.Some facets of his Religion of Humanity resembled Roman Catholicism. The interior of the decaying church here in Rio still has the feel of an austere cathedral, albeit one where services stopped after part of the roof collapsed during a storm in 2009. Worshipers exalted a female icon similar to the Virgin Mary and modeled on Clotilde de Vaux, with whom Comte was in love.But Comte also told followers to worship humanity, not God, and created a new calendar. Its starting year was 1789, when a mob stormed the Bastille in a defining moment of the French Revolution; he named months after historical titans like Gutenberg, Charlemagne, Shakespeare and Dante.Still, Giovanni Fernandes, the custodian of the Positivist Church, sometimes lets a visitor or two slip inside, offering a glimpse into Brazil\u2019s not-so-distant past. Scattered around the entrance are century-old pamphlets in Portuguese and French that the positivists once printed in the basement.The titles of the rotting booklets reflect the issues, political infighting and prejudices that used to consume Brazil: \u201cObligatory Vaccination and the Politics of the Republic,\u201d \u201cThe Question of the Border Between Brazil and Argentina,\u201d \u201cIn Defense of Brazilian Savages.\u201dOne room with a spiral staircase contains a trove of sculptures shrouded in dust, including a statue of Clotilde de Vaux cradling an infant. Decaying paintings on the wall seem to depict aristocrats in European-style attire lost in philosophical reflection.\u201cThere\u2019s so much dust and grime in here that occasionally I tell visitors they should bring a surgical mask,\u201d said Mr. Fernandes, 57, the church\u2019s lonely watchman. \u201cI\u2019m often asked if the building is haunted, and I reply, \u2018No, I wouldn\u2019t work alongside any ghosts.\u2019\u201dPositivists staked out progressive stances on an array of issues, waging crusades against government corruption and in favor of legislation to improve working conditions for poor Brazilians. Clashing with an entrenched oligarchy, positivists campaigned for Brazilian abolition in 1888.\u201cImagine how that went over in a slaveholding country on edge over any whisper of uprisings,\u201d Mr. Carvalho said. \u201cThe positivists were extremely forward-looking for their time.\u201dStill, while Comte\u2019s Religion of Humanity had more sway in Brazil than in many other countries, the faith never really caught on among Brazilians beyond a core group of adherents thought to number in the hundreds in Rio and the southern cities Porto Alegre and Curitiba.Some scholars say potential converts chafed at facets like a ban on remarrying after the death of one\u2019s spouse and the religion\u2019s treatment of women, who were to draw a salary for raising children but were prohibited from finding jobs outside the home.Then there was the sense of bewilderment over certain positions by Comte, like his belief that the brain is an organ through which dead people influence the living \u2014 hence the enigmatic sign that once adorned the church\u2019s gate.Until around a decade ago, a dwindling group of about 10 congregants still convened in the church for services, before the roof collapse. Now the descendants of devotees donate their own time and meager funds to keep the building from collapsing altogether.\u201cWe have thousands of rare books in here, not to mention statues, paintings, banners, ledgers, correspondence and who knows what else,\u201d said Ms. Souza, the heritage director, whose father, Danton Voltaire Pereira de Souza, led the church until his death in 2014.\u201cIt saddens me to think we may be among the last of the positivists,\u201d she said, leaning on scaffolding that was part of an abandoned restoration effort. \u201cSometimes it feels like we are standing against oblivion.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018I\u2019m Here to Help,\u2019 Trump Tells Tech Executives at Meeting", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "Supported byThe meeting between President-elect Donald J. Trump and the nation\u2019s tech elite was hyped as something out of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d: The new boss tells his minions to shape up. It turned out to be a charm offensive, a kind of \u201cDancing With the Silicon Valley Stars.\u201d\u201cThis is a truly amazing group of people,\u201d the president-elect said on Wednesday in a 25th-floor conference room at Trump Tower in Manhattan. The gathering included Jeff Bezos of Amazon; Elon Musk of Tesla; Timothy D. Cook of Apple; Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook; Larry Page and Eric Schmidt of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company; and Satya Nadella of Microsoft, among others. \u201cI\u2019m here to help you folks do well,\u201d Mr. Trump said.He kept going in that vein. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody like you in the world,\u201d he enthused. \u201cIn the world! There\u2019s nobody like the people in this room.\u201d Anything that the government \u201ccan do to help this go along,\u201d he made clear, \u201cwe\u2019re going to be there for you.\u201dAnd that was just in the first few minutes. The candidate who warned during the presidential campaign that Amazon was going to have antitrust problems, that Apple needed to build its iPhones in the United States instead of China, was nowhere to be seen.Even after the press was ushered out, the meeting continued its genial way. Among the topics discussed, according to several corporate executives and a transition official briefed on the meeting, who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, were vocational education and the need for more of it, the promise and peril of trade with China and immigration (Mr. Trump wants \u201csmart and talented people here\u201d). The president-elect also asked the executives to see if they could not apply data analysis technology to detect and help get rid of government waste.There are plans for quarterly meetings of a smaller group of tech executives, to be organized by Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, said one of the executives briefed on the meeting. They will focus mainly on immigration and education issues.\u201cI won\u2019t tell you the hundreds of calls we\u2019ve had asking to come to this meeting,\u201d Mr. Trump told his guests. Everyone laughed.To get to the 25th-floor conference room, the tech leaders entered the golden elevators of Trump Tower the same way anyone would \u2014 by punching a button. This gave the news media, cordoned off a few feet away, time to shout questions. None of the executives took the bait.Neither did they talk on the way out, although by that time the building was being closed for Trump Tower\u2019s holiday party. Safra Catz, the co-chief of Oracle who attended the meeting, gave a thumbs up.Mr. Bezos later issued a statement that said he found the meeting \u201cvery productive.\u201d\u201cI shared the view that the administration should make innovation one of its key pillars, which would create a huge number of jobs across the whole country, in all sectors, not just tech \u2014 agriculture, infrastructure, manufacturing \u2014 everywhere,\u201d he said.The technology world had been in turmoil as the meeting drew near. Some argued the chief executives should boycott the event to show their disdain for Mr. Trump\u2019s values. Others maintained they should go and forthrightly make their values clear. And still others thought they should attend and make their accommodations with the new reality.Complicating the debate was the fact that the most fervently anti-Trump elements in Silicon Valley seem to be the start-ups and venture capitalists, few of which were invited to the meeting. (Alex Karp, the chief executive of Palantir Technologies, was the only head of a privately held tech company at the meeting.)Some tech companies were also notable for their absence. Twitter, the president-elect\u2019s medium of choice for communication, was not invited.In the days and hours before the meeting, various factions made their positions clear.A group of engineers and other tech workers issued a statement asserting that they would refuse to participate in the creation of databases that could be used by the government to target people based on their race, religion or national origin.Another group of entrepreneurs assembled virtually this week with the same goal of preventing any erosion of civil liberties.Mr. Levie, of Box, was a Hillary Clinton supporter but believes in engagement with the new administration.\u201cWe have to face reality that this is the next four years, and the best way to make sure our values are upheld is actually push on them,\u201d he said.More than values and policy are at stake in the relationship between the administration and the Valley. Money is, too.In the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, Forrester Research is cutting back its growth estimate for the United States tech market in 2017 to 4.3 percent from 5.1 percent.One reason is simple caution, as large multinational manufacturers navigate a new and unpredictable administration.Another reason: less tech spending by the government. \u201cThere are so many cabinet secretaries who are explicitly hostile to the mission of their agencies,\u201d said Andrew Bartels, a Forrester principal analyst.As for 2018, there are so many ways things could go that a forecast is impossible. \u201cIt\u2019s up for grabs,\u201d the analyst said.So, too, is the relationship of Mr. Trump and the tech industry. For the moment, though, Silicon Valley seems to have dodged a bullet.Julie Hirschfeld Davis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A \u2018Stonehenge,\u2019 and a Mystery, in the Amazon", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "Supported byCal\u00e7oene JournalCAL\u00c7OENE, Brazil \u2014 As the foreman for a cattle ranch in the far reaches of the Brazilian Amazon, Lailson Camelo da Silva was razing trees to convert rain forest into pasture when he stumbled across a bizarre arrangement of towering granite blocks.After conducting radiocarbon testing and carrying out measurements during the winter solstice, scholars in the field of archaeoastronomy determined that an indigenous culture arranged the megaliths into an astronomical observatory about 1,000 years ago, or five centuries before the European conquest of the Americas began.In what is now the sparsely populated state of Amap\u00e1 in northern Brazil, the sun stones found by Mr. da Silva near a stream called the Rego Grande are yielding clues about how indigenous peoples in the Amazon may have been far more sophisticated than assumed by archaeologists in the 20th century.\u201cWe\u2019re starting to piece together the puzzle of the Amazon Basin\u2019s human history, and what we\u2019re finding in Amap\u00e1 is absolutely fascinating,\u201d said Mariana Cabral, an archaeologist at the Federal University of Minas Gerais, who together with her husband, Jo\u00e3o Saldanha, also an archaeologist, has studied the Rego Grande site for the last decade.It was not until Mr. da Silva, the former ranch foreman, came across the stones at Rego Grande while deforesting surrounding jungle in the 1990s that scholars focused greater attention on the findings. Mr. da Silva said he first stumbled on the site while hunting wild boar as a teenager in the 1960s, but had subsequently avoided the area.\u201cThe place initially felt sacred, like we didn\u2019t belong here,\u201d said Mr. da Silva, who now guards the Rego Grande site as its custodian. \u201cBut it was impossible to miss it during the deforestation drive of the \u201990s, when the priority was to burn down trees.\u201dAbout 10 years ago, after securing public funds to cordon off the stones, Brazilian archaeologists led by Ms. Cabral and Mr. Saldanha began excavating the site, which is shaped roughly like a circle. They soon identified a portion of a river about two miles away where the granite blocks may have been quarried.After identifying other points in the site where stones could be associated with the sun\u2019s movement on the solstice, the researchers began piecing together a theory that Rego Grande could have served various ceremonial and astronomical functions connected to agricultural or hunting cycles.Ms. Cabral said that Rego Grande and a series of other less elaborate megalithic sites found in Amap\u00e1 may have also served as markers for hunters or fishermen on a landscape that was being transformed by Amazonian peoples a millennium ago.Still, other scholars say that more information may be needed about Rego Grande to lift it into the realm of prehistoric places clearly conceived for astronomical observations.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of similar claims, but it takes more than a circle of standing stones to get to a Stonehenge,\u201d said Jarita Holbrook, a scholar of physics and cultural astronomy at the University of the Western Cape in South Africa, citing the need for more findings about Rego Grande\u2019s characteristics and how the site was used by the people who built it.For now, Rego Grande, which local people already call the Amazonian Stonehenge, remains enigmatic. Pottery shards jut through the soil as if offering tantalizing clues around the place, which has the feel of a contemporary conceptual art piece. Researchers are still trying to determine how Rego Grande fits into the evolving views on the Amazon\u2019s human history.Representatives of the Palikur, an indigenous people living in Amap\u00e1 and French Guiana, have recently stepped forward to say that their ancestors had frequented Rego Grande. Still, archaeologists express caution about establishing such links, emphasizing how much can change in human societies over the span of a thousand years.Either way, John McKim Malville, a solar physicist at the University of Colorado who writes extensively on archaeoastronomy, emphasized how the field is moving away from focusing exclusively on astronomical functions to interpretations that are more holistic, by including the ceremonies and rituals of ancient cultures.In that sense, the site in Cal\u00e7oene offers a beguiling if cryptic glimpse into Amazonia\u2019s past.\u201cThe stones of Rego Grande are quite extraordinary and in their irregularity may have their own unique meaning, different from other megalithic sites around the world,\u201d Mr. Malville said, raising the possibility that Rego Grande reflects the importance in Amazonian cultures of animism, the attribution of a soul to entities in nature and even inanimate objects.He added, \u201cWe can only speculate what its stones mean.\u201dAn earlier version of the headline with this article misspelled the name of the circular stone monument in England that the megaliths in Brazil are being compared to. It is Stonehenge, not Stonhenge.The Cal\u00e7oene Journal article on Dec. 15, about archaeological discoveries in the Brazilian Amazon that have upended earlier views about the human history of the Amazon Basin, misstated the given name of a scholar at the University of the Western Cape in South Africa who cited the need for more research on an arrangement of megaliths in Cal\u00e7oene, Brazil, that resembles Stonehenge. She is Jarita Holbrook, not Jovita. The article also misstated, at one point, the surname of a physicist at the University of Colorado who called the stones \u201cquite extraordinary.\u201d As noted correctly elsewhere in the article, he is John McKim Malville, not Melville.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Yellow Fever Epidemic in Africa Shows Gaps in Vaccine Pipeline", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byGlobal HealthThe yellow fever outbreak in Africa this year came closer to being a disaster than is widely recognized, public health experts recently disclosed. The epidemic also revealed glaring weaknesses in the emergency vaccine supply pipeline.Ultimately, the yellow fever outbreak was halted only by a huge vaccination campaign that stretched supplies by diluting doses, and even that succeeded only because some unusual donors stepped in.Brazil contributed 18 million doses of yellow fever vaccine \u2014 three times the amount in the emergency stockpile \u2014 to contain the African outbreak. Even South Sudan, one of the world\u2019s poorest nations, gave up 400,000 doses intended for its children.The outbreak, which began last December and appeared to be over as of September, went largely unnoticed because attention was focused on the Zika epidemic. Some aspects were truly frightening, experts said at the annual conference of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in Atlanta in mid-November.For the first time, the virus reached Asia \u2014 a continent with no yellow fever immunity. Ultimately, however, there were only 11 cases in China, all in returnees who had been working in Africa.\u201cIt did not get a foothold in Asia, but if it did, it would be a real nightmare,\u201d said Dr. Axelle Ronsse, an emergency medical coordinator for Doctors Without Borders, which led the fight against yellow fever in the Democratic Republic of Congo.More than 100,000 Chinese work in Africa and many, Dr. Woodall noted, come from tropical southern China where Aedes mosquitoes already spread dengue and could spread yellow fever.Kinshasa, Congo\u2019s capital, narrowly missed having a runaway outbreak. There were only 16 cases far from the crowded city center.Just 50 cases, Dr. Ronsse said, would have overwhelmed her mosquito-control teams, which sprayed 325 acres of the city.Although there were fewer than 1,000 laboratory-confirmed cases in the outbreak over all, there were more than 6,000 suspected cases and undoubtedly many more unreported.Only about 15 percent of cases get the characteristic yellow eyes, dark urine and abdominal pain, but half of them die.Yellow fever was one of the great scourges of the 18th and 19th centuries. Imported to the Americas from Africa with the slave trade, the mosquito-borne virus regularly killed hundreds of thousands in Latin America and the Caribbean.Since a vaccine was invented in the 1930s, it has been held in check, circulating in monkeys in Africa and the Amazon jungle. The virus regularly starts small outbreaks in remote villages, but it can cause explosive urban outbreaks when it is transmitted from forest mosquitoes to Aedes aegypti, which prefers to live among humans.Aedes aegypti is called the yellow fever mosquito, but it also transmits Zika, dengue and other pathogens.In December 2015, four Eritrean workers who frequented the market in Viana, a suburb of Luanda, died, as did the owner of a restaurant where they ate. Food poisoning was suspected at first.It was not until January, after blood samples reached the Pasteur Institute in Senegal, that the fever was diagnosed. By then it was spreading fast within Luanda, a metropolitan area of almost seven million.By February, 12 Angolan provinces were affected. Why the disease never moved south into Namibia or east into Zambia is unclear. The borders are sparsely populated, two years of drought lowered mosquito populations, and those countries do some routine vaccination.The virus did move north into Congo, which has two port cities, Boma and Matadi, on the border with Angola. Kinshasa, a city of 10 million, is just up the Congo River and across from Brazzaville, where two million more live.A huge population was suddenly at risk, but the emergency vaccine stockpile, administered by a committee in Geneva, then held only six million doses.The vaccine is grown in chicken eggs for as little as $1 a dose, said Dr. Thomas P. Monath, a vaccine expert formerly with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.But because profits are low, many pharmaceutical companies dropped it. In 1970, 14 private or national vaccine factories made yellow fever vaccine; now only six do, and only four sell it to the World Health Organization. The manufacturers were asked to increase production, and other countries were asked to divert their supplies.The outbreak turned into a race between the vaccine and the mosquitoes.The first six million doses reached Luanda by late February, and officials in Angola requested four million more. Those did not all arrive until late May.Then Congo urgently asked for two million doses, and Uganda, which had a brief, unrelated outbreak, requested one million. With panic spreading, it was reported that one million doses had been stolen, and that forged vaccination certificates were circulating.Then Peru reported a big yellow fever outbreak, raising worry again; but it was brought under control without outside help.Ultimately \u2014 and luckily \u2014 it was the mosquitoes that stumbled.Doctors Without Borders vaccinated residents of Matadi, the Congo border city. In Kinshasa, it suppressed each of the 16 known cases by spraying every nearby house with three types of pesticide: spray on indoor walls, fog outdoors, plus larvide in standing water.By October, more than 31 million people were vaccinated \u2014 but only by diluting each dose by five to one.\u201cThe end of the story was successful,\u201d Dr. Sylvie Briand of the W.H.O.\u2019s outbreaks and emergencies branch, adding, with understatement, \u201cbut it was really a logistical challenge.\u201dIf an outbreak had started in China, the crisis might have been much greater.Dr. Monath calculated that 160 million doses would be needed to contain it \u2014 and only if, diluted tenfold, they still worked. At full capacity, the world\u2019s vaccine factories produce half that many in a year.Advertisement"}

His frank curiosity and broad musical tastes form the basis for this terrific book about the globalization of ideas in our age of \u201cdigital superabundance.\u201d Examining the analog-to-digital shift through the lens of music \u2014 specifically, the hardware, software and online platforms that have transformed art and commerce \u2014 these in-depth essays explore how technology continues to affect our \u201ccut-and-paste culture,\u201d from the ease of streaming MP3s on Spotify to the proliferation of low-res cellphone dance videos. Readers learn the difference between \u201crefix\u201d and \u201cremix\u201d and the secret to Cher\u2019s inescapable hit \u201cBelieve,\u201d while glimpsing the more esoteric (and decidedly male-dominated) worlds of international D.J.-ing and Maghreb pop music. Artists may be alarmed by Clayton\u2019s generally untroubled view of sharing pirated files, but it is hard not to be swept up in his celebration of viral culture and the joys of public listening. Humor and humility infuse descriptions of a street dance party in Kingston, Jamaica; traffic in Cairo; and a smoke-filled music store in Beirut. Throughout, we feel the moral weight of the personal stories behind the music, whether of dispossessed African musicians who are celebrated abroad while living in illegal anonymity, or the Mexican immigrants who harvest and prepare our food behind the scenes. Guided by empathy and openness to the new, this D.J. has his ear to the ground.\u201cAelian, in the second century, said of the hyena fish \u2014 a creature no longer known to ichthyologists \u2014 that if you cut off its right fin and put it under your pillow, you will have terrifying visions.\u201d Combining scholarly authority with a moral allegiance to the arcane, the translator and editor Weinberger creates genre-bending essays and prose poems to help us see the world anew. This eclectic collection spans centuries and cultures and might make you wonder if there is anything its author doesn\u2019t know. A corresponding omniscience shapes the works themselves, as in \u201cThe City,\u201d a prismatic look at urban centers across time. This anthropological stance guides much of the book. First-person narratives channel explorers of the Amazon and the American West, while hybrid works like the title essay and \u201cA Calendar of Stones\u201d merge history, creation myths and other lore, revealing the earnest folly of our efforts to comprehend the mystical. The book\u2019s second half contains equally inventive cultural criticism, including essays on Herbert Read, Charles Reznikoff and Bela Balazs, and an intriguing comparison of translations of the I Ching. Weinberger often marshals fantastical-yet-real facts, in texts as brief and deadpan as anything by Lydia Davis. One powerful example lists interactions at the Berlin Wall, with the taunts and human gestures of the West followed by a meticulous Soviet-style log of censure and shots fired. Other incisive commentary includes \u201cBush the Postmodernist,\u201d an inspired review of George W. Bush\u2019s \u201cDecision Points\u201d by way of Foucault.Uniting essays from Oliver\u2019s previous books and elsewhere, this gem of a collection offers a compelling synthesis of the poet\u2019s thoughts on the natural, spiritual and artistic worlds. From the changing landscapes and wildlife that inspire her to the literary ancestors (Emerson, Whitman, Poe) who sustain her, Oliver contemplates what it means to build a life and survive \u2014 whether it is the spider whose feeding, spinning and birthing she devotedly monitors in \u201cSwoon\u201d; the gravely injured gull whose battered existence she honors in \u201cBird\u201d; or Emerson and Poe, whose diverse creative paths Oliver views as a search for moral order after grievous personal loss. We encounter Oliver as a solitary child building leaf-and-stick houses in the Ohio woods and as an adult so deeply acquainted with the ponds of Cape Cod that she can snatch a few turtle eggs and scramble up a meal \u2014 savoring the eggs as she would have us live our lives, \u201cwith attention, whimsy, devotion and respect.\u201d In nature\u2019s balance Oliver also finds anguish and the terrifyingly inexplicable, and these brief essays at times turn, like her poems, on a discerning closing phrase that creates new resonance. With each page, the book gains accumulative power. The various threads intertwine and become taut, linking, for instance, Emerson\u2019s \u201cweb of God\u201d to the spider\u2019s web in the stairwell \u2014 and to Oliver\u2019s forthright question, \u201cDo you think there is anything not attached by its unbreakable cord to everything else?\u201dThis lively, helpful guide presents a series of arguments for tapping into the basic tenets of popular fiction to create propulsive stories and novels in any genre. Without stooping to formula or how-to promises, Percy \u2014 a longtime fan of fantasy, horror and the western \u2014 provides precise advice concerning basics like suspense, setting and style. His approach is analytical, offering concrete techniques to (for example) incorporate back story within the action of a sentence, or maintain tenor and mood when dialogue threatens to disrupt it. Making reference to movies and music as well as literature, and celebrating writers as varied as Zora Neale Hurston, Kate Bernheimer and Stephen King, Percy suggests that realism is a \u201ctrend\u201d while \u201cthe beastly majority of stories contain elements of the fantastic.\u201d His evocative personal anecdotes invigorate even familiar material like \u201cMaking the Extraordinary Ordinary,\u201d where instead of the usual examples from, say, Kafka, Percy plucks from Karen Russell, Nick Hornby and George Saunders. In each essay we glimpse an industrious Percy at the daily grind of writing, rereading and editing his fiction. He good-naturedly describes one of his short-storyish novels as a \u201cshnovel\u201d and recounts the ways he pillaged an unpublished manuscript to create various shorter narratives; his tales of rejection (one story turned away by 39 literary magazines before being accepted) and extreme revision inspire with hard-earned wisdom. Beyond craft or theory, and perhaps more helpful than any advice, this book serves as a reminder that writing is hard work.Daphne Kalotay is the author of the novels \u201cRussian Winter\u201d and \u201cSight Reading.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "More Than Cookie Sellers: The Girl Scouts Buff Their Image", "Date": "2016-12-11", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingThe Girl Scouts want you to know there\u2019s more to them than cookies.The list of accomplished Girl Scout alumnae is long \u2014 including the pop star Taylor Swift and the tennis greats Serena and Venus Williams. Michelle Obama, the organization\u2019s honorary president, enhanced its visibility when she hosted a scout campout last year on the South Lawn of the White House. But the venerable organization, about to celebrate its 105th anniversary, is being buffeted by slipping membership numbers, especially among middle-school girls, who can lose interest because of sports, homework and social media.With parents often busy, traditional volunteers also are scarcer. Other girls have left scouting because they wanted more focus on traditional outdoor activities and less on sales of Thin Mints and Samoas.To counter any perception that scouting is out of date, the Girl Scouts are introducing a new marketing campaign that highlights their GIRL initiative \u2014 it stands for go-getters, innovators, risk takers and leaders \u2014 to better define what it has to offer, according to Sylvia Acevedo, the interim chief executive of Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., the group\u2019s national body.\u201cWe are trying to galvanize our conversation with girls and let them know we are the premier leadership organization for them,\u201d she said.Six years ago, the organization revamped its image for the first time in decades. Old-fashioned badges became less important than experiences, particularly annual cookie sales, which were heralded as teaching money management and other business skills. The cookie program is too vital to Girl Scout finances \u2014 it brings in some $800 million in annual sales \u2014 to be abandoned, but, with a continuing slide in members, planning began more than a year ago to clarify and broaden the organization\u2019s appeal.The new approach includes a peppy contemporary Girl Scout anthem, a public service announcement highlighting the kinds of roles that girls might take on, a digital fund-raising effort targeting small donors and a national gathering to expose more people to the organization.Ms. Acevedo said that the Girl Scouts would also partner with some community-based organizations. The first such partnership is expected to be announced early next year, and it is seen as crucial because of low membership among growing minority populations. Currently the Girl Scouts have 1.8 million members, a drop from 2.1 million three years ago. About two-thirds of scouts are white, according to Girl Scout figures.In an attempt to broaden the organization\u2019s appeal, the Girl Scouts will host a gathering in Columbus, Ohio, in October that will be open to Girl Scouts and to nonmembers. The event, called GIRL 2017, will give girls opportunities to learn about subjects like therapy animals and hear from entrepreneurs about their experiences building businesses.The new approach can entail some risk.\u201cIt can be a big mistake to dilute a brand,\u201d said Americus Reed, professor of marketing at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.\u201cSome are attracted because the DNA in a brand like Girl Scouts comes from gender stereotype roles, but others find that a turnoff because they want something more progressive, like coding, for their daughters,\u201d said Mr. Reed, who studies how people identify with, and become loyal to, brands or products.As part of their new marketing campaign, the Girl Scouts issued an \u201cI\u2019m Prepared \u2026 to Lead Like a Girl Scout\u201d public service announcement that is airing nationwide. The 30-second spot, in which girls \u2014 none of whom are in scouting uniforms \u2014 try a variety of activities including playing the guitar and skateboarding, is also on the Girl Scout YouTube channel, its website and its social media accounts.The spot is set to \u201cWatch Me Shine,\u201d a song written for the Girl Scouts by Liz Rose, a Grammy winner, and Emily Shackleton, who sings lead. The anthem, which will be used at official Girl Scout events, is also available on iTunes, Google Play and Amazon music, with part of the proceeds going to the Girl Scouts organization. The point is to appeal to girls in middle school, the age at which scouting can sometimes lose its appeal.\u201cWhen you are 13 or 14, you may not know about the opportunities you can have in scouting and the chance to see older girls be leaders,\u201d Sarah Greichen, 17, of Centennial, Colo., said.\u201cGirl Scouts has really transformed me,\u201d added Ms. Greichen, who started scouts as a 7-year-old Brownie.\u201cI didn\u2019t know how to make a phone call to an adult, how to write a business letter or how to speak publicly,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I learned when I created my organization, called Score a Friend; I had to talk to parents, teachers, administrators and school district heads.\u201dThe organization, inspired by her autistic twin brother, has clubs, and a website, to promote inclusiveness by helping students connect with others and make new friends.While Girl Scouts promote the idea that girls should enroll from kindergarten through high school, some in the organization promote some flexibility. Janet Frasier, chief executive of the Girl Scouts of Utah, said the branding overhaul emphasized the scouts\u2019 \u201cbrand essence, which helps us connect more with girls.\u201dBut, as a mother of three teenage girls, Ms. Frasier said that while precollege academic commitments can lead some teenagers to drop scouting, she felt that \u201cwe need to show that Girl Scouts is a way that girls can differentiate themselves on the competitive road to higher education.\u201d\u201cBut even if girls stay only seven or eight years,\u201d she added, \u201cGirl Scouts has provided a foundation for their future.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stephen Root Is Just the Man for a Cubicle or a Castle", "Date": "2016-12-23", "News": "Supported byOver the phone from Sherman Oaks, Calif., Mr. Root, 65, discussed the show\u2019s timely appearance and the enduring appeal of red staplers. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.How did you prep for \u201cThe Man in the High Castle\u201d? I grew up reading Arthur Clarke, and Ray Bradbury and Clifford Simak, and all these guys including Philip K. Dick \u2014 but I had never read that book, which kind of astonished me. When Frank Spotnitz [the show\u2019s creator] called, I did not get a chance to read it until after I\u2019d shot the first episode. So I had to go completely by the script.There\u2019s a lot of dialogue in the series that could be applied to this year in America.It\u2019s prescient. It makes this season\u2019s premiere more interesting for a lot of people, because it is a show about living within a totalitarian regime, which we are not in, but it\u2019s certainly a sea change from what we\u2019ve been living under.The season\u2019s premise is also resonant with the rise of fake news and CNN chyrons that would have been jokes on \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d six months ago.Each of your characters has a distinctive physicality. Do you spend a lot of time people-watching?Absolutely! That\u2019s one of the things I love about being in New York. In Los Angeles, you\u2019re in your spaceships, driving around in your car, and you don\u2019t get to people-watch. The subway is the greatest people-watching place of the century. That\u2019s exactly what you do as a character actor. When I\u2019m with a group of [character actors], and we\u2019re out, we\u2019ll see people and go, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s a guy I\u2019m going to do.\u201d Put him in a permanent library of your memory.Will you get off at their stop and tail them?No, but will I go over and start listening to them, and maybe go an extra stop or so, just to get it? Yeah, I\u2019ve done that.Was Milton the result of a person you saw in public? Not really. Mike Judge [the writer and director of \u201cOffice Space\u201d] had done a sketch of Milton, had done the voice himself when we were at Fox. He took several of us from \u201cKing of the Hill\u201d and a couple other people over to read the script of \u201cOffice Space.\u201d He was going to read the voice himself, but then he decided literally as we were walking over: \u201cRoot, you read it.\u201d I went, \u201cWell, thanks for the prep, Mike.\u201d [Laughs] And while [in his version] he had a whiny voice, that\u2019s not what I heard when I was reading the script. I heard him with a lisp. It\u2019s almost as if you can\u2019t hear him sometimes.That was actually direction from Mike! As Milton is pushed farther and farther into the bowels of the building, Mike wanted him to get softer and softer. So by the time he\u2019s sitting in the dark, you can barely hear him. Which I think is brilliant.Do you get a lot of people coming up to you talking about staplers?Almost exclusively. [Laughs] When I did a [theater] show in New York, I would have Milton people outside for a least a couple days a week. I\u2019ve gone on to sets before, and there\u2019s a tray of staplers waiting for me. I\u2019m so happy that it\u2019s a little movie that resonates with people. There are always going to be cubicles. The computers will change, but it\u2019s the same mentality.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Forget AT&T. The Real Monopolies Are Google and Facebook.", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThe proposed merger of AT&T and Time Warner has drawn censure from both sides of the political aisle, as well as a Senate hearing that looked into the potential for the combined company to become a monopoly.But if we are going to examine media monopolies, we should look first at Silicon Valley, not the fading phone business.Mark Cuban, the internet entrepreneur, said at the meeting of the Senate Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee last week that the truly dominant companies in media distribution these days were Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon.\u201cFacebook is without question in a dominant position, if not the dominant position, for content delivery,\u201d he said.Look at the numbers. Alphabet (the parent company of Google) and Facebook are among the 10 largest companies in the world. Alphabet alone has a market capitalization of around $550 billion. AT&T and Time Warner combined would be about $300 billion.Alphabet has an 83 percent share of the mobile search market in the United States and just under 63 percent of the US mobile phone operating systems market. AT&T has a 32 percent market share in mobile phones and 26 percent in pay TV. The combined AT&T-Time Warner will have $8 billion in cash but $171 billion of net debt, according to the research company MoffettNathanson. Compare that to Alphabet\u2019s balance sheet, with total cash of $76 billion and total debt of about $3.94 billion.In the first quarter of 2016, 85 cents of every new dollar spent in online advertising will go to Google or Facebook, according to Brian Nowak, an analyst with Morgan Stanley.Google and Facebook can achieve huge net profit margins because they dominate the content made available on the web while making very little of it themselves. Instead, they both have built their advertising businesses as \u201cfree riders\u201d on content made by others, some of it from Time Warner. The rise of these digital giants is directly connected to the fall of the creative industries of our country.Every pirated music video or song posted on YouTube or Facebook robs the creators of income, and YouTube in particular is dominated by unlicensed content. Google\u2019s YouTube has an over 55 percent market share in the streaming audio business and yet provides less than 11 percent of the streaming audio revenues to the content owners and creators. But Facebook, which refuses to enter into any licensing agreement on music or video, is challenging YouTube in the free online video and music world.In the past decade, an enormous reallocation of revenue of perhaps $50 billion a year has taken place, with economic value moving from creators of content to owners of monopoly platforms.I reached this conclusion from the following statistics: Since 2000, recorded music revenues in the United States have fallen to $7.2 billion per year from $19.8 billion. Home entertainment video revenue fell to $18 billion in 2014 from $24.2 billion in 2006. United States newspaper ad revenue fell to $23.6 billion in 2013 from $65.8 billion in 2000.And yet, by every available metric, people are consuming more music, video, news and books. During that same period, Google\u2019s revenue grew to $74.5 billion from $400 million.The former editor of The Guardian, Alan Rusbridger, estimated that Facebook had \u201csucked up $27 million\u201d of the paper\u2019s projected digital advertising revenue in the last year by essentially keeping Guardian readers on Facebook, rather than linking them to the Guardian site.\u201cThey are taking all the money,\u201d he noted. \u201cThey have algorithms we don\u2019t understand, which are a filter between what we do and how people receive it.\u201dBut the problem isn\u2019t just for musicians, authors, filmmakers or even the phone company. As the former Google \u201cdesign ethicist\u201d Tristan Harris wrote, \u201cIf you control the menu, you control the choices.\u201dWe have ceded much of our freedom to choose by giving networks like Google and Facebook control of the menu (Google\u2019s search rankings and Facebook\u2019s Newsfeed). How that menu is determined by these black box algorithms isn\u2019t known by anyone outside those companies. As more and more of our lives become digital, these new algorithms will assume more power over our lives.Regulators should take a hard look at the merger between AT&T and Time Warner. After the hearing on Wednesday, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the ranking Democrat on the antitrust subcommittee, suggested that what was needed were hearings that would also include Alphabet and Facebook. She\u2019s right.But in some ways, that\u2019s just fighting the last war. We have gone through a long election cycle without any discussion about the unregulated world now dominated by a few Silicon Valley giants. Perhaps in January we can have an honest national conversation on monopoly and our future.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A World of Surveillance Doesn\u2019t Always Help to Catch a Thief", "Date": "2016-12-18", "News": "Supported byBitsSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Earlier this year, I had a beer in one of the more budget-conscious bars in the Mission district. My wallet stayed a little later than I did.I didn\u2019t notice that until 11 a.m. the next day, when I got a call from my bank. Hey, a helpful man in card fraud detection asked, in the last 12 hours had I been to McDonald\u2019s twice, taken four rides with Uber, purchased a disposable phone at MetroPCS, and visited Walgreens and Target?What followed was sadly familiar to many of us: I spent the day canceling credit cards, ordering new health insurance identification, replacing my driver\u2019s license, and trying to remember what else, besides cash, was in my wallet.A week later, relatively whole again in plastic, I received from my bank a list of all of the charges (which the bank covered). They provided a rough guide to the evening.Looking at the numbers, I began to wonder: How many times, during that disappointingly banal crime spree, was my thief photographed, tagged, measured or otherwise observed in our semi-constant world of databases? And with a modest effort, how hard would it then be for the police to find him?The answer to the first question is, probably several dozen times. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that all this monitoring is helpful to someone like me.Some companies are reluctant to talk about how much they are filming you, or how long they keep the images. Others simply have a hard time knowing.For example, about 90 percent of the 13,000 or so McDonald\u2019s restaurants in the United States are owned by independent owner-operators, so the company can\u2019t really say if those people have cameras. \u201cWe assume the majority do,\u201d said Terri Hickey, a company spokeswoman. \u201cWe strongly recommend their installation and use.\u201dWhat about a McDonald\u2019s in San Francisco? \u201cAlmost certainly there\u2019s cameras, inside and out,\u201d said Grace Gatpandan, an officer with the city\u2019s Police Department. \u201cIf it\u2019s a drive-through, they\u2019re going to have a camera.\u201d Some of those cameras are to record people who try to drive off without paying, or to catch employee theft.A Walgreens at 23rd and Mission Streets, another stop that night, is well equipped with cameras, too. \u201cAt least two in the pharmacy, the entranceway, probably over the shopping aisles,\u201d said Phil Caruso, a Walgreens spokesman. \u201cWe like those, and some of the ones on the exterior, to be visible, and we put a sign in the front so people know they\u2019re being filmed.\u201dLike many other big stores, Walgreens often has other, smaller cameras about door height, to catch faces in case the police want close-ups of people.Target was not willing to talk about what my thief bought with my card, or its use of video, but it may be the most extensive watcher of all. Just the checkout area of its store at Fourth and Mission Streets in San Francisco, the most likely location my thief visited, has at least 18 cameras, from four manufacturers.The thief spent almost $200 at Target, enough to afford nine of the 13 different home video surveillance cameras Target sells there. That would have involved walking past another 50 highly visible surveillance domes.The San Francisco Police Department likes this video deluge, according to a department spokesman, Carlos Manfredi, because things like credit card fraud are often linked to other crimes. \u201cWe\u2019ll circulate pictures of people to all the stations around town, to see if other officers know the person from other crimes,\u201d he said.They also go up on private channels on YouTube and Vimeo, he said.My case was at the other end of the crime spectrum, but even the style of the crime provides clues about the thief. This man or woman started small, with the McDonald\u2019s and Walgreens purchases, and apparently made the big purchase at Target once there was confidence the card was going through. The thief also stuck to one card.Is it weird to feel a little shame here? What, my card isn\u2019t good enough for the high-end service?Mr. Sullivan, a former federal prosecutor in Las Vegas who has also worked at eBay and Facebook, said criminals called these small purchases \u201cbust-out charges.\u201d \u201cYou go little at first, make sure the card works,\u201d he explained. \u201cThen you go big.\u201d My bank appears to have stepped in right after the first substantial purchase.That isn\u2019t to say that my thief was a master criminal. I don\u2019t have an Uber account, and he (Mr. Sullivan\u2019s term, though Uber\u2019s privacy rules prevented the company from telling me anything more) put the card on an existing account.Uber also has GPS data on every ride, time stamps on rides, and the names of drivers. The drivers are allowed cameras of their own in cars, but Uber doesn\u2019t know how many use them.\u201cIf the police are interested in your case, we have a lot we can share with them,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said.Big \u201cif.\u201d After two visits and three calls to the Mission district station, and three calls and two emails with San Francisco Police Department public affairs (a route not open to most civilians), the police assigned someone to my case. That was well over a month after the theft. Walgreens gave them some video, which has been circulated, but Target had already junked its footage.Uber, which over its four rides obtained route information and the person\u2019s address, was not contacted.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Says It Will Run Entirely on Renewable Energy in 2017", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byMINCO, Okla. \u2014 Last year, Google consumed as much energy as the city of San Francisco. Next year, it said, all of that energy will come from wind farms and solar panels.The online giant said on Tuesday that all of its data centers around the world will be entirely powered with renewable energy sources sometime next year.This is not to say that Google computers will consume nothing but wind and solar power. Like almost any company, Google gets power from a power company, which operates an energy grid typically supplied by a number of sources, including hydroelectric dams, natural gas, coal and wind power.What Google has done over the last decade, with relatively little fanfare, is participate in a number of large-scale deals with renewable producers, typically guaranteeing to buy the energy they produce with their wind turbines and solar cells. With those guarantees, wind companies can obtain bank financing to build more turbines.The power created by the renewables is plugged into the utility grid, so that Google\u2019s usage presents no net consumption of fossil fuels and the pool of electricity gets a relatively larger share of renewable sources.\u201cWe are the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the world,\u201d said Joe Kava, Google\u2019s senior vice president of technical infrastructure. \u201cIt\u2019s good for the economy, good for business and good for our shareholders.\u201dUnlike carbon-based power, Mr. Kava said, wind supply prices do not fluctuate, enabling Google to plan better. In addition, the more renewable energy it buys, the cheaper those sources get. In some places, like Chile, Google said, renewables have at times become cheaper than fossil fuels.Whether Google is the largest buyer of renewables would be difficult to verify, as many industries do not release data on how much energy they consume. There is no doubt, however, that Google\u2019s large computer complexes, along with similar global operations by Amazon and Microsoft, are among the world\u2019s fastest-growing new consumers of electricity.Google hopes that success in working with large wind farms, like the 50,000-acre facility in Minco, Okla., which supplies Google\u2019s large data center in Pryor, Okla., will spur development of the industry. NextEra Energy, which owns the wind farm, has about 115 wind farms in the United States and Canada.About 25 percent of United States electricity goes to businesses, and companies like Google are now about 2 percentage points of that. Dominion Virginia Power, located in a state with perhaps the world\u2019s largest concentration of data centers, last year had a demand increase from those customers of 9 percent, while overall demand was nearly flat, according to Dominion.Google operates eight different businesses, including internet search engines, YouTube and Gmail, each of which has over 1 billion customers. They run on a global network of 13 large-scale data centers, each one a complex of many buildings containing hundreds of thousands of computers.The 5.7 terawatt-hours of electricity Google consumed in 2015 \u201cis equal to the output of two 500 megawatt coal plants,\u201d said Jonathan Koomey, a lecturer in the school of earth, energy and environmental sciences at Stanford. That is enough for two 140,000-person towns. \u201cFor one company to be doing this is a very big deal. It means other companies of a similar scale will feel pressure to move.\u201dIt moves the needle on costs to have a big consumer, Mr. Koomey added, since a larger market tends to allow for economies of scale and more innovation. \u201cEvery time you double production, you reduce the cost of solar by about 20 percent. Wind goes down 10 to 12 percent,\u201d he said.Facebook has entered into similar deals with wind producers. Last week, Amazon reiterated its long-term commitment to power its machines entirely with renewable energy, though for 2016 it expects to be above about 40 percent of its goal. It has announced five more solar projects.Microsoft says it has been 100 percent carbon neutral since 2014, but much of this comes from the purchase of carbon offsets, which are investments in things like tree planting or renewables projects meant to compensate for the fossil fuels a company consumes. The company hopes to have half of its electric power supplied from wind, solar and hydroelectric sources by 2018. Its data centers currently use about 3.3 million megawatt-hours of power a year.Critics note that while Google might be adding wind and solar to the world\u2019s power grid, overall it is still dependent on fossil fuels, since sun and wind power are intermittent, while demand for things like YouTube cat videos is continual.\u201cIn my mind it\u2019s a P.R. gimmick,\u201d said Chris Warren, vice president of communications at the Institute for Energy Research, a think tank in Washington supported largely by donations from individuals and companies in the fossil fuel industry. \u201cIf they think they can actually support themselves with wind and solar panels, they should connect them directly to their data centers.\u201dNext year\u2019s goal will be 95 percent accomplished with wind turbines around the world, Mr. Kava said, and Google\u2019s support for the industry could keep prices dropping, particularly relative to things like coal. \u201cWe\u2019re technology-agnostic, but we\u2019re not price-agnostic,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article gave an outdated title for Jonathan Koomey at Stanford. He is a lecturer in the school of earth, energy and environmental sciences, not a research fellow at the Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Being \u2018Fleabag,\u2019 From Stage to TV and Back Again", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Within five minutes of the first episode of \u201cFleabag,\u201d Phoebe Waller-Bridge is masturbating over President Obama. As he gives a speech on her laptop, her right hand drifts down under the duvet. \u201cThere will be difficult days along the way,\u201d Mr. Obama warns. The screen starts to jiggle.That might explain the itch to bring \u201cFleabag\u201d back to the theater. \u201cI really, really felt the pull of wanting to do it as it was originally done,\u201d Ms. Waller-Bridge said. \u201cI was slightly trepidatious about people knowing the end, the reveal, but audiences seem so invested in the story that it doesn\u2019t seem to have affected it in any big way.\u201dIn a sense, Fleabag is a creature of the stage. Ms. Waller-Bridge likens her to \u201ca little devil running around, released from the guilt and shame of life.\u201d In her compulsive oversharing and scornful eye-rolls, she has something of the court jester or sacred clown, allowed to tear through society\u2019s taboos. Her candor \u2014 be it sexual, societal or scatological \u2014 can be cathartic: \u201cI always knew that saying the unsayable was going to be a powerful thing.\u201dMs. Waller-Bridge seems born for that. Just shy of six feet tall, with a loose brown bob and prim features, she seems proper but speaks in profanities. Nothing\u2019s off limits: \u201cI just find all that stuff incredibly funny. I love a fart. I\u2019d do anything for a good poo story.\u201dHere, the odd anecdote isn\u2019t autobiographical. It is all forged out her frustrations. \u201cI was feeling really, really cynical about love and sex and relationships and men,\u201d Ms. Waller-Bridge said. \u201cI was a real romantic until my early 20s, and then it did all become vagina shots and porn and expectations of sex.\u201dMostly, she was irked by the way she saw women portrayed. \u201cThat\u2019s why I wanted to create a character who sexualized everything \u2014 from her pizza to her father,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been drilled into her that sex is the most powerful language for a woman.\u201dThe flip side is that Fleabag\u2019s shamelessness is perversely empowering. For Ms. Waller-Bridge, the writing should \u201calways be about the glory of being a woman,\u201d with Fleabag free to say anything.The result is the kind of curious, challenging feminism that emerged just as Ms. Waller-Bridge started writing. \u201cFleabag knows men and women are equal and should be treated as such,\u201d she said, \u201cbut what she\u2019s confused about \u2014 and what I was confused about \u2014 was the idea that wanting bigger boobs doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t want equal rights.\u201dThe same frustrations occurred professionally. Training at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, she found herself pushed in a particular direction. \u201cThe fun of acting got lost on the way,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI went in wanting to be a character actor and left primed to be a quirky leading lady.\u201d\u201cI looked exactly like Russell Brand,\u201d she added.\u201cDryWrite writing nights were like nothing else,\u201d Mr. Thorne said. \u201cThey were a party.\u201dMs. Waller-Bridge sees them differently. \u201cIf I look back, it was such a shameless training ground,\u201d she said. \u201cI was in awe of all these writers, but I learned a lot from them.\u201dAnd what of \u201cFleabag,\u201d which ran for six episodes and could stand as is?\u201cI was really determined that I wasn\u2019t going to do another series unless I could find another story,\u201d Ms. Waller-Bridge said. \u201cIn my heart, this was the story. It had a beginning, a middle and an end.\u201dShe paused, then said, \u201cThat\u2019s the thing I\u2019m trying to crack at the moment.\u201d \u201cFleabag\u201d will be back.Advertisement"}

Status symbols. Fetish objects on par with luxury watches and limited-edition Nikes.William Crosson, a 28-year-old executive recruiter and part-time D.J., wears V-Moda Crossfade Wireless headphones, a $270 set that looks like something a cyberhooligan might wear to a Berlin disco.Alexander Gilkes, a member of Vanity Fair\u2019s best-dressed list and co-founder of the auction site Paddle8, wears $400 headphones made by Master & Dynamic.Martin Gaynor, a 27-year-old freelance app developer for the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, wears Symphonized 2s, a pair of wood-covered, over-the-ear headphones that he bought on Amazon for $53. \u201cThe wooden earthy look just seemed to complement the subdued classical look I have on a day-to-day basis,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just matched.\u201dThe combination of the iPhone and headphones in many varieties (in-ear, over-the-ear, shaped-to-your-ear and so on) gives city dwellers the ability to largely avoid an experience that was once arguably the whole point of living in the crowd \u2014 interacting with others.In a fraught public sphere, headphones provide a measure of privacy. Those who fall deeply into a Spotify playlist or the latest installment of an addictive podcast enter a cocoon-like zone all but impenetrable to tourists, beggars and those do-gooders with clipboards.But Ms. Klausner knows she opens herself to experiences she may otherwise miss when she leaves the headphones at home.\u201cThe other morning, I forgot my headphones and was on the 2 train going to physical therapy when I spilled water over my own seat,\u201d she said. \u201cThen this smiling older woman came over to talk. If my headphones had been on, that probably wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201dA look through Mr. Perdomo\u2019s black Banana Republic bag revealed that he, like other urban warriors, has headphones for all occasions.Tucked into a small cardboard box was a pair of white Jaybird wireless in-ear headphones for the gym. Should the Jaybirds fail, Mr. Perdomo had a backup: trusty white Apple earbuds, the minimalist sound-delivery system that was all the rage not so long ago but has increasingly been replaced by more garish accessories. At home, Mr. Perdomo said, is an old pair of Beats.\u201cI like my music,\u201d he said.All the same, he believes something has gotten lost as many people navigate public spaces under the spell of the private experiences encouraged by digital media.\u201cTechnology has ruined us,\u201d Mr. Perdomo said. \u201cYou go to a restaurant and look around, and maybe 80 percent of the people are looking at their phones.\u201dThe experience of intense private listening in public settings is nothing new. It goes back to teenagers communing with the Shangri-Las via the earpieces connected to transistor radios in the 1950s and \u201960s. It recalls the Sony Walkman craze of the \u201980s.But the latest round of headphones popularity may be an expression of our disaffected times, coming during a season when people holding different views on matters political and cultural struggle to open their mouths without triggering an argument.Some headphones are chrome and accentuate the bass. Others are gold and boost the treble. The companies producing them can go from obscure to white-hot overnight.Enormous growth has taken place for headphones priced from $99 to $500. But companies like HiFiMan, Audeze and JH Audio have built substantial businesses selling headphones that retail for as much as $3,000.A guide for the audiophile and the casual listener, from Beats to Sensaphonics.Alexander Wang and Proenza Schouler are collaborating with brands like Beats and Master & Dynamic on limited editions. Canali teamed with Pryma. Barneys, Neiman Marcus, Colette and Opening Ceremony all stock headphones.\u201cFor Sennheiser, it\u2019s product placement and an indictment,\u201d Mr. McBurney said.Did they mind?\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said.The paradox of the headphone experience \u2014 which somehow brings together, as Mr. McBurney suggested, isolation and intimacy \u2014 did not seem to be on the mind of Val Kolton, 39. A sports-car-obsessed techno fanatic, he founded a headphones company in 2004, naming it V-Moda because \u201c\u2018moda\u2019 means fashion,\u201d he said, and all his favorite brands were Italian.\u201cPrada, Dolce & Gabbana, Versace,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I was really into motorsports. Lamborghini, Ferrari, Ducati.\u201dBefore starting his business, Mr. Kolton was living in San Diego and working at Aviatech, a digital marketing company. Then he had an awakening on a dance floor in Ibiza, Spain.\u201cWe were doing antismoking commercials, and I heard we were going to do another for Mothers Against Drunk Driving,\u201d Mr. Kolton said one evening this fall, as he sat on a black leather sofa in his West Hollywood offices. \u201cAnd I was having a drink and a smoke, and I thought: \u2018You know what? Why am I doing all these \u201canti\u201d campaigns? What\u2019s next? An antisex campaign? Dance music is going to break through. House music is here!\u2019\u201dTwo years later, Mr. Kolton\u2019s parents gave him money to produce candy-colored $99 earbuds. At the time, Apple was scheduled to release the first iPhone, with a recessed headphone jack that was incompatible with most headphones on the market.Mr. Kolton got the bright idea of manufacturing his line to Apple\u2019s market-busting specifications. He flew to Cupertino, Calif., and made the pitch. He figured he would be one of many entrepreneurs with Apple in mind, but that was not the case.The market got more crowded after Beats by Dr. Dre, founded by Andre Young, known as Dr. Dre, and the music producer and executive Jimmy Iovine, introduced its first $300 headphones in 2008.\u201cThirty years ago, when someone said, \u2018I want to make a headphone,\u2019 he would probably try to make it here in the United States, or he might design it and then get on a plane and say to the people who make headphones in China: \u2018Here\u2019s the design. Can you execute it?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cNow, we\u2019ve eliminated the first two steps. The requirement, quote unquote, is that the person who\u2019s running the show knows what it should sound like and look like and feel like and is able to say, \u2018Keep showing me your samples until I find it.\u2019\u201dBy the time Jonathan Levine, 54, a former investment banker at Lehman Brothers, started the headphones company Master & Dynamic in 2014, it was clear that design and marketing were key.Mr. Levine settled on the brand name Master & Dynamic because it sounded similar to established audio brands such as Bang & Olufsen, Astell & Kern, and Bowers & Wilkins. \u201c\u2018Levine\u2019 didn\u2019t exactly scream luxury,\u201d he said.To get out the message for his 1950s-inspired, produced-in-China headphones, with its cognac-colored headband, he hired Carolina Clouet, a Balenciaga-clad former consultant for Barneys and Neiman Marcus, as his director of sales.In October 2014, Bergdorf Goodman, Opening Ceremony and Colette received the first shipments of Mr. Levine\u2019s pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, the $399 MH40. In December of that year, Mr. Levine\u2019s team sent them as freebies to Art Basel Miami Beach attendees at the Edition hotel and the Standard Miami.\u201cNobody has made a fashion headphone that\u2019s in-ear,\u201d Will.i.am said by phone while on a break from taping the British edition of \u201cThe Voice.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re all big headphones that sit over your head. The reason we went with earbuds is because we were designing it to be like jewelry.\u201dThe countless options can be paralyzing to customers. The writer and radio host Kurt Andersen said he had trouble picking the right headphones as he perused CNET\u2019s exhaustive review section recently.\u201cI like that the over-the-ears are not as dorky as they once were,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ones from Beats seem fine. But then do I look like someone trying to be young, with groovy, hip-hop headphones?\u201dA challenge for the industry is getting women interested in its high-end gear. Amy Uaarmorn, a 31-year-old staff member at the Chateau Marmont hotel in Los Angeles, received a free pair of Master & Dynamic MH40s last year. Yet she said she seldom wears them and cannot imagine spending any more than $50 or $100 on headphones.Some of the ultraexpensive headphones are made to fit your ear exactly. To get a pair, you see an audiologist, who takes impressions of yours ears using a Play-Doh-like substance and ships them off to a manufacturer like Noble Audio.This variety, known as CIEMs (short for custom in-ear monitors), started with touring musicians, who use them to block ambient noise and monitor their own sound.The trend really took off when JH Audio, a big player in this area, began posting photos of its famous customers and their CIEMs on Facebook and Instagram.But even as the boom shows no sign of abating, there are those who, like Ms. Uaarmorn, have no interest in spending hundreds or thousands of dollars for a perfect listening experience.Julie Klausner is also sticking to the basics.\u201cApple earbuds,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t really need anything else.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "BookCourt, a Literary Cornerstone in Brooklyn, Is Closing", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byBookselling is a tough business these days, but BookCourt in Brooklyn seemed destined to stay.But on Tuesday, Mr. Zook and Ms. Gannett said they planned to shut BookCourt on Dec. 31, sending a gasp through its literary community and its Cobble Hill neighborhood.BookCourt had weathered the upheaval of the bookselling industry over the last 20 years as reading habits changed and online outlets like Amazon rose. It withstood the 1999 opening of a Barnes & Noble store just a few blocks away and even outlasted the owners\u2019 marriage.But the store could not survive one fundamental thing: the desire of both owners, now in their 60s, to retire. \u201cWe know the store will be missed, and we are very proud of what we accomplished,\u201d Mr. Zook and Ms. Gannett wrote in a statement. They said that the longevity could be explained in part because they had \u201cinvested in the neighborhood and the real estate which housed the bookstore.\u201d Over the years the couple bought the two stately buildings that house the store on bustling Court Street.Since its opening in 1981, BookCourt has hosted many famous authors who have stopped in the city for readings, lectures and talks, including Junot D\u00edaz, Megan Abbott and Don DeLillo. And it has been a base for the writing community that has swelled in Brooklyn and a springboard for many lesser-known authors.Ms. Straub has had launch parties for all of her books here. \u201cFor me, there was no place more important,\u201d she said.Dennis Johnson, a founder of Melville House, a publishing company in Brooklyn, said he was shocked that the store was closing.\u201cThey\u2019re really supportive of little publishers like us,\u201d he said.Mr. Johnson said that in the early 2000s, Mr. Zook would sell books at a few of his events. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019ll bring a load down and sell them for you,\u2019\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cI doubt he made any money.\u201dMr. Zook and Ms. Gannett had opened the store long before the borough\u2019s resurgence as a thriving cultural center and hip place to live.Zack Zook, 32, a son of BookCourt\u2019s owners, grew up in an apartment above the store. In the 1990s the block had overgrown vacant lots full of rusting automobiles. Rats abounded, he said, and some of the store\u2019s workers had been mugged nearby.\u201cIt was radically different than it is now,\u201d he said. The vacant lots have been replaced by a Starbucks and a high-end grocery store.The novelist Jonathan Lethem said the store also influenced Brooklyn\u2019s literary boom. \u201cTo have a neighborhood bookstore like that was part of the formation of the character of the place as we now know it,\u201d he said.Ms. Gannett and Mr. Zook\u2019s statement did not say why they decided to retire at the end of the year, but Zack Zook said his mother no longer lived upstairs and his father had moved upstate.\u201cThey got in early. They were able to make sound investments,\u201d Zack Zook said. \u201cUsually when you make a significant investment, there is some kind of return.\u201dOn Tuesday, customers quietly perused the store. A woman with a dachshund on her lap read a children\u2019s book in the window. A clerk moved his arms like a windmill to a song on the stereo. One man conversed about the suburbs as a clerk dusted the store shelves. The air smelled of hardwood floor and the pages of books.\u201cIt\u2019s just the sort of amenity people move to Brooklyn for,\u201d said Betsy Sand, who had been buying books at the store since it opened. She recalled that after Hurricane Sandy, \u201cthis place was the neighborhood gathering place.\u201dNationally, statistics indicate that independent bookselling is on the rise. The American Booksellers Association, which represents independent booksellers, said its membership included more than 2,300 stores in 2016, up from 1,651 in 2009.Ms. Straub and her husband plan to open a bookstore, a decision that came to them after learning BookCourt was closing. First, they asked Mr. Zook and Ms. Gannett to let them take over the store. \u201cBut that didn\u2019t work out,\u201d Ms. Straub said. Instead, they will try to open a store nearby.\u201cWe decided that we couldn\u2019t stomach living in a neighborhood with no independent bookstore,\u201d Ms. Straub said.Nate Schweber contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Salinger\u2019s \u201cThe Catcher in the Rye\u201d and Harper Lee\u2019s \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d (minus the rape charges, Ku Klux Klan rallies and racial slurs).\u201cThe goal of all of this is to get them really psyched about these books now, so that they\u2019ll want to read the originals later,\u201d Ms. Medina said.\u201cIt\u2019s a more educational approach than just Spot the dog,\u201d said Suzanne Gibbs Taylor, the creator of the BabyLit series.Another popular series, Cozy Classics, which was created by the twin brothers Jack and Holman Wang, reduces great works of literature to 12-word stories, illustrated with photos of handmade felt figurines. (Their rendition of Tolstoy\u2019s \u201cWar and Peace\u201d can be rattled off in a single breath: \u201cSoldier-Friends-Run-Dance-Goodbye-Hug-Horse-Boom!-Hurt-Sleep-Snow-Love.\u201d)Their titles, which include \u201cJane Eyre,\u201d \u201cEmma\u201d and \u201cAdventures of Huckleberry Finn,\u201d are designed for babies and toddlers, but include some arch visual jokes directed at the parents, like a felt figurine of Miss Havisham flailing about in flames in \u201cGreat Expectations.\u201dHolman Wang said he and his brother wanted to preserve the sometimes grim and complex tone of the originals, rather than conforming to the \u201cfluffy bunny aesthetic\u201d of most contemporary picture books.\u201cIt\u2019s not about saying, \u2018My 2-year-old has read \u2018Pride and Prejudice,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe try not to cheaply capitalize on these brand-name stories by sanitizing them and losing the themes.\u201dSome educators are skeptical of efforts to spoon-feed complex literary works to small children, especially when there\u2019s such a rich body of classic children\u2019s literature.\u201cIt\u2019s ludicrous to take great works that are clearly for adults and reduce them for children,\u201d said Monica Edinger, a fourth-grade teacher at the Dalton School in Manhattan, who dismissed KinderGuides as a disingenuous attempt to exploit parents\u2019 insecurities.Still, some parents counter that children can absorb the bigger themes, like the idea of resilience in \u201cThe Old Man and the Sea\u201d or adventurousness in \u201cOn the Road.\u201dJon likes the book based on \u201c2001\u201d the best, because \u201cit\u2019s in space and it\u2019s kind of creepy,\u201d Mr. Almond said. (Jon didn\u2019t seem especially bothered by one of the more chilling scenes, when the ship\u2019s computer, Hal, turns on the astronauts and sends one of them out of the spaceship to his death, Mr. Almond said. )Ms. Medina and Mr. Colting got the idea for KinderGuides about a year ago, when they were visiting her family in Kansas. Mr. Colting was reading \u201cThe Old Man and the Sea,\u201d and Ms. Medina\u2019s 6-year-old niece asked him what it was about. He realized the story was easy to summarize, and saw a market opportunity.Despite that earlier legal entanglement, Mr. Colting had no qualms about repurposing famous novels as picture books, including \u201cThe Catcher in the Rye.\u201d He argues that because they function as study guides as well as entertainment, the KinderGuides books don\u2019t infringe on copyrighted works. Some copyright experts dispute that logic.\u201cIf you are literally taking a book and trying to translate it for children, taking what makes it literature and copying that, that sounds like infringement,\u201d said Rebecca Tushnet, a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center.This year, Mr. Colting and Ms. Medina started an independent publishing company out of their home in Los Angeles, and began making a list of beloved classics to recast. After choosing their first few titles, they read the original works and highlighted the central themes and characters, and consulted study guides like CliffsNotes and SparkNotes. Mr. Colting wrote the text, and Ms. Medina created storyboards pairing the texts with sketches or descriptions of images. They hired a different illustrator for each book, and printed 20,000 copies in total for the first four titles.They aim to publish 50 books, though not every classic novel seems feasible.James Joyce\u2019s \u201cUlysses,\u201d for instance, was considered but ultimately rejected.\u201cWe couldn\u2019t in good faith do it,\u201d Mr. Colting said, \u201cbecause we haven\u2019t read it.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the relationship between the author Fredrik Colting and Melissa Medina, who are being sued for copyright infringement. Mr. Colting and Ms. Medina are a couple and business partners; they are not married.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Floating Courthouse Takes the Rule of Law to Brazil\u2019s Frontier", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byItamatatuba JournalITAMATATUBA, Brazil \u2014 As the riverboat anchored at dawn in Itamatatuba, a far-flung outpost of the Brazilian Amazon, the court clerk rose from his hammock onboard. The bailiffs sipped their coffee. The judge rubbed the sleep from her eyes.The judge and her staff board this three-story riverboat, called the King Benedict, every few weeks from Macap\u00e1, the capital of Amap\u00e1 State, and set out on the Amazon River.\u201cThat\u2019s where we come in,\u201d said Sgt. Eurismar da Cruz, 47, a police officer from Macap\u00e1 who serves as a bailiff in the riverboat court. Wielding pistols, he and other bailiffs fan out each morning on a small speedboat in search of people suspected of committing crimes.Their first target on a Friday morning in Itamatatuba, a village of wooden shacks with about 600 inhabitants, was Jhon Beyck Pantoja, 35, the owner of the settlement\u2019s only discoth\u00e8que.At a table on the boat\u2019s deck where hammocks hung just hours earlier, one of Mr. Pantoja\u2019s five ex-wives, Talia de Paula, 19, told the court that he had recently stopped paying her $30 a month in child support for their 3-year-old daughter, Manuela.\u201cThe man is a scoundrel, a liar and a philanderer,\u201d Ms. de Paula said, bouncing Manuela on her knee as she glared at her ex-husband.Mr. Pantoja, clad in shorts and sandals and flashing a gold watch on his wrist, called his predicament \u201ccomplicated.\u201d He said that he had five children by five wives over the years, and that paying child support for each of them was an unrealistic burden on his meager finances.\u201cI pay them all when I have the money, but some months are tougher than others,\u201d said Mr. Pantoja, whose outdoor nightclub, Caribe, lures patrons on weekend nights who cling to one another under its strobe lights.One of the court\u2019s clerks interjected, telling Mr. Pantoja, \u201cFrankly, you just have to stop making more children.\u201d Then the judge issued a quick verdict, ordering the defendant to honor his financial obligations to his ex-wife or be jailed for three months.As Ms. de Paula smiled at the outcome, Mr. Pantoja scowled.\u201cThe authorities on this boat don\u2019t rely on facts, but on gossip,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least I\u2019ll have children to carry my coffin when I die.\u201dThroughout the day, others shuffled onto the boat. Some sought the other services available onboard, receiving social security cards, voting papers and water purification tablets.Still, the vibe onboard is mellow. After dusk, the members of the court gathered on the top deck to sip beer under a mesmerizing night sky, singing along as Rubens Barros, 38, the boat\u2019s chief law clerk, strummed a guitar to songs like \u201cSina,\u201d by the Brazilian composer Djavan.\u201cEach voyage is a bonding experience, but we stick to some basic decorum: Keep your shirt on, respect the person in the hammock next to you, and if you drink beer, then do so in moderation,\u201d Mr. Barros said.Still, not everyone is impressed when the floating courtroom makes its way through the heavily forested Bailique Archipelago, an assortment of islands on which about 7,000 people live.\u201cMy taxes pay for justice, but I feel the approach is superficial,\u201d said Andreia Figueiredo, the principal of the small public school in Itamatatuba. \u201cThey pursue cases involving humble people, but what about large-scale deforestation or political corruption? There\u2019s no riverboat going after the biggest thieves.\u201dIn the last case of the day, bailiffs hauled in Concei\u00e7\u00e3o Pantoja, 67, whose brother accused him of firing on a neighbor\u2019s herd of water buffaloes. Mr. Pantoja argued that he was innocent of any wrongdoing, saying he had fired his rifle only to fend off jaguars attacking his own herd.\u201cSir, don\u2019t you know it\u2019s illegal to kill jaguars in this country?\u201d Judge Brand\u00e3o asked the defendant.Mr. Pantoja was charged with illegal possession and use of a firearm, crimes that could put him in prison for four years. Judge Brand\u00e3o agreed to rule on his case on the boat\u2019s next swing through Itamatatuba.\u201cWe used to be free in these parts to settle things our own way,\u201d he said. \u201cNow the city people on this boat want to tell a man how to live his life.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lois Weber, Eloquent Filmmaker of the Silent Screen", "Date": "2016-12-15", "News": "Supported byCritic's NotebookAlthough Weber developed a lot of her own original material at Universal, where she was under contract, the studio assigned her to take on \u201cThe Dumb Girl of Portici,\u201d one of the 10 (!) features she directed that were released in 1916. (The studio boss Carl Laemmle said he \u201cwould trust Miss Weber with any sum of money that she needed to make any picture.\u201d) She wrote the film, adapting it from an 1828 opera, set in Spanish-controlled Naples in 1647, that tells the story of Fenella, a mute woman seduced by a Spanish nobleman, who promptly abandons her. As passion sours into betrayal, a personal affront quickly feeds a political outrage that, in turn, ignites a violent peasant uprising.There isn\u2019t all that much pirouetting in \u201cDumb Girl,\u201d which probably matters less to film lovers than to dance aficionados. Pavlova twirls on occasion, including during a charming, folksy frolic on a beach, complete with a shaking tambourine, but, for the most part, she delivers a heightened version of silent-era realism. Her exaggeration makes sense for her character, who, after all, cannot speak. Fenella gestures to her mouth to explain her muteness, throws her head back in pleasure and uses her entire body to express herself. Pavlova\u2019s thin, pale arms are especially striking \u2014 they\u2019re trembling parentheses \u2014 whether she\u2019s throwing them up in joy or thrusting them forward in entreaty.Weber doesn\u2019t lavish a lot of close-ups on Pavlova, preferring instead to show the dancer-star in longer shots. This may have had to do with Pavlova\u2019s age (she was in her 30s and not remotely girlish, at least here), but it also comes across as a shrewd directorial choice that serves both the story and the star. Throughout \u201cThe Dumb Girl,\u201d Weber shifts between intimacy and spectacle, but in the end this story \u2014 and its scale \u2014 becomes larger than Fenella, who\u2019s a tragic, sacrificial pawn. Weber also clearly understood that because there is no ballet in this tale for the world\u2019s most famous ballerina, Pavlova, nevertheless, must be seen head to toe \u2014 her body must lead. (Pavlova does appear on point in two brief bookending sections that come across as strategically commercial.)Weber is known for her films about women, families, social problems and religious themes, but her range was larger than many summaries suggest. She directed a few films about birth control (including the sensational \u201cWhere Are My Children?\u201d), but she also adapted Shakespeare (\u201cThe Merchant of Venice\u201d) and directed an anti-capital-punishment film (\u201cThe People vs. John Doe\u201d). Like a lot of silent directors, she was somewhat of a self-promoter and gave many interviews to writers who seemed to feel compelled to let readers know that Lois Weber was also Mrs. Phillips Smalley. Female directors may have enjoyed independence in the industry; outside was another matter.Advertisement"}
